&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While considerable attention has been paid to how unwanted Russian actions in the maritime domain can be deterred, less has been paid to the maritime contribution to deterrence more broadly defined. The authors argue that this is a gap in the literature that needs to be filled, since the maritime domain remains an area of overwhelming Allied advantage. The function of this paper is to contribute to discussions of how actions at sea can translate into strategic effects on land in the context of the European theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s application of maritime power can better translate into strategic effects with three subtle changes: firstly, through the creation of an environment that forces Russia to expend resources on capabilities needed to deny the open ocean to NATO navies; secondly, the employment of maritime forces can serve as a war termination tool by increasing the costs of a protracted conflict in tandem with ground forces, which deny short-term gains; and finally, because many of the platforms which Russia employs for sub-strategic nuclear use are either maritime or, like strategic bombers, can be impacted from the sea with conventional capabilities, a maritime threat to the bulk of Russia’s sub-strategic launch capability can considerably alter perceptions of a favourable strategic balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper outlines a strategy for how Allied maritime power could be employed to create costly capability requirements for Russia, in order to offset the country’s competitive edge in other domains. The paper’s key findings are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia views the maritime domain as critical to the strategic balance – in other words, the capacity to both strike an adversary’s homeland and deflect strikes on Russia itself. Its view of the role of its navy is one that de-emphasises purely naval functions such as seizing sea control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The capabilities that Russia needs to perform both functions are among those which it will find most difficult to generate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By investing in maritime capabilities such as long-range precision strike and operating at a higher tempo on Russia’s extended periphery, the members of NATO can impose opportunity costs on Russia’s military. Investments in deflecting Allied maritime power will prove unavoidable for Russia, and will divert critical resources from its recapitalisation of other joint capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO should, however, recognise its own shortfalls, including the subset of challenges related to military capacity. Firstly, capabilities needed to compete effectively with the Russian Federation in the medium term will be required in a 10-year timeframe, which is shorter than procurement times for most major programmes. The second likely concern is a lack of platforms to hold strike assets, and this also needs to be mitigated. In addition, different approaches to anti-submarine warfare could expand the threat envelope for opponents and mitigate the Alliance’s own potential shortfalls in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the question in each instance will be whether the capabilities developed will impose more costs than those required to develop them in the first place. It is conceivable that even marginal investments in the areas described will impose disproportionately costly adaptations on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sources informing this paper included desk research on Allied and Russian capabilities, as well as an examination of Russian military literature to identify areas where Russian authors perceive their nation to be vulnerable in the maritime domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of how Allied maritime power should be employed against a continental rival spurred considerable debate during the Cold War. Some saw the maritime preponderance of the Alliance as an asymmetrical advantage which might be used to offset Soviet advantages on the ground. Others, by contrast, emphasised the centrality of deterrence through denial against the Red Army, which remained the sword arm of Soviet power (as Russian ground forces remain to this day), and contended that the primary function of maritime power should be to contain Russian threats to sea lines of communication at chokepoints such as the Greenland–Iceland–UK (GIUK) Gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the Russian challenge bears certain similarities with, though is not identical to, that posed by the USSR. Russia remains primarily a land power with a more limited capacity for power projection at sea. This having been said, the Russian navy, officially known as the Military Maritime Fleet (Voyenno-Morskoi Flot, or VMF), does play an important role in Russia’s overarching approach to competition and conflict. In competition, the VMF is expected to support limited power projection, as it did in Syria through the provision of logistical lift and long-range precision strikes. As competition escalates, the VMF plays three core roles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limiting the threat to the Russian homeland and in particular its defence industry, command and control (C2) nodes and nuclear-capable platforms. The VMF is expected to achieve this both through an active effort to disrupt threats from the maritime direction at reach and with a layered defence close to Russian shores.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conducting long-range conventional strikes against the territory of hostile states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintaining a portion of Russia’s tactical and strategic nuclear throw-weight&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, the Russian state views the sea as critical to shaping the strategic balance within which general purpose forces are used. Rather than naval combat per se, the purpose of Russian sea power is to ensure that the Russian state can compete and engage in conflict safely and effectively. To be sure, this is by no means the only function of Russian sea power, but it is central and has been demonstrated in the use of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in the ongoing conflict with Ukraine. In Ukraine, the key contributions of the Black Sea Fleet – long-range Kalibr strikes and an ongoing blockade – are not central to Russia’s goal of destroying the Ukrainian army (though strikes can contribute to missions such as interdiction). What the fleet has contributed, however, is a level of economic damage that will shape both Ukraine’s capacity to confront Russia in the long term and its post-war stability. With its deployment in the Mediterranean before the war, the fleet was likely intended to act in a deterrent role vis-à-vis NATO by serving both as a tripwire and a symbol. In effect, its role has been not to secure sea control, but to provide strategic shaping for land forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of both the new Strategic Concept and the Deterrence and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area framework, how should Allied maritime power best reinforce the goals set out for NATO, which focus on reinforcing the Alliance’s capacity for territorial defence within Europe and the more broadly defined growing competition with Russia? The assertion of this paper is that the focus can, in principle, be on committing Russia to an unsustainable posture in the maritime domain that detracts from its more lethal land aspirations. The Alliance has avenues through which, by exacerbating pervasive Russian fears regarding threats in the maritime domain, it can both reinforce general deterrence and force the VMF to adapt in ways that impose opportunity costs on it in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core function of Allied maritime power, though by no means an exclusive one, can be its use as a means of shaping Russian perceptions of the strategic balance, as opposed to the military balance. (The latter might be understood as the ability to impact targets of critical national significance at depth, as distinct from fielded forces.) Specifically, by shaping Russian leaders’ perceptions of the relative risks involved in escalation, as well as the conditions under which war termination would occur, maritime power can complement an overarching strategic focus on both competition and deterrence by denial. Rather than contributing directly to denial, the function of maritime power would be indirect – by forcing Russia to commit to its own defences in the maritime domain, it would divert critical Russian resources to tasks that the Alliance deems less threatening. Furthermore, in a crisis or a conflict, this would complement deterrence by denial. Denial has the primary role of preventing an opponent from achieving an outcome rapidly and, while important, in a conflict this merely sets the conditions for war termination to be achieved by other means. Failing this, an opponent that is initially frustrated can double down on its objectives, particularly if it perceives there to be avenues by which it can win through exhaustion. A case in point would be Russia’s ongoing conflict in Ukraine, where, upon being frustrated in its initial approach, Russia shifted to a strategy of attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach outlined above is comparable to the Allied maritime strategies adopted in the late 1980s, in terms of their strategic logic of identifying and playing on existing Russian fears, and their emphasis on maritime power as a tool of war termination. However, a different set of tools can be employed operationally to obviate some of the challenges inherent in replicating this strategy today, among them the difficulty of operating forward in defended bastions, particularly with current submarine numbers, and the escalatory risks of doing so. At the operational level, Allied maritime power will be most effective if it is capable of delivering effects at reach and if it can complicate some of the challenges that Russia faces with respect to engaging dynamic targets. This is distinct from the maritime strategy of the 1980s, which envisioned operating as closely as possible to defended Russian bastions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, a core function of Allied maritime power ought not to be deterrence by denial but the diversion of Russian capability and the cultivation of a favourable strategic balance. Though this can serve the overarching goal of general deterrence, it is distinct from deterrence understood as the use of specific threats or instruments to dissuade specific actions. The authors argue that this framing can usefully act as a baseline through which the employment of Allied capabilities in theatres such as the High North can be contextualised, as well as a means of better understanding the interrelationships between the individual regions which collectively form the maritime periphery of European NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this paper, the authors utilise a combination of methods to validate their argument, which includes an analysis of Russian military journals to ascertain where Russian officers perceive themselves to be facing capability gaps, as well as research into the capabilities that Russia and the Alliance currently field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-enduring-russian-threat&quot;&gt;The Enduring Russian Threat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia will, in all likelihood, pose a limited conventional threat to the Alliance for up to a decade, due both to its losses and to its ongoing commitments in Ukraine, this could change once the country has reconstituted its land forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, it was reported that the Russian state would allocate 40% of its federal budget to defence, and the Russian regime intended to increase the size of its army by 400,000 recruits. While it remains to be seen whether the Russian state is capable of sustaining an increased rate of military expenditure over the medium to long term, it should be noted that there is limited historical evidence for the argument that it cannot do so. States facing considerable economic pressures have nonetheless maintained levels of spending that, proportionately speaking, match Russia’s: Iran, for example, maintained a defence budget which represented 4–5% of its GDP over the course of the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign. Indeed, even during the 1990s, Russia itself typically spent at least 3% of its GDP on defence for most of the decade. It is therefore plausible that Russia will maintain its current levels of military expenditure, representing around 5% of its GDP, in the face of economic circumstances which, though negative and characterised by sluggish forecasted growth, are not nearly as bad as those of the 1990s, with the country’s GDP falling by 45% between 1989 and 1998. For Europe, this creates the challenge of deterring a competitor which, though it remains plagued by qualitative inefficiencies, can generate and replace forces at a scale which European nations will presently struggle to match – a challenge which will become more acute as the US has to allocate an ever-growing proportion of its resources to competition with a peer competitor in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergence of a larger, if less sophisticated, Russian threat on the ground could coincide with a greater emphasis on the use of nuclear brinkmanship as a tool of statecraft. While there has been no explicit shift in Russian nuclear policy, statements both by figures within the regime, such as Nikolai Patrushev, and by academics, such as Sergei Karaganov, suggest that this is at least being debated. Certainly, there is precedent for this – Russia’s 2000 nuclear doctrine for example, conceived of a large set of scenarios to which nuclear weapons could be relevant. Moreover, as the US grapples with extended nuclear deterrence against two nuclear peers by 2030, the nuclear balance underpinning existing Western deterrence will have shifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is thus not inconceivable (though admittedly not certain) that in a decade, Russia will pose a renewed conventional threat backed by an arsenal that is sufficiently large and diversified to be able to provide it with flexible nuclear options that the Alliance lacks. Alternatively, Russia might opt for a strategic posture not unlike that which nations such as North Korea and Pakistan opted for in the face of conventional overmatch: combining aggressive sub-threshold competition with the use of nuclear weapons as a backstop against escalation to a conventional war that Russia cannot win. Russia might base a future force posture around sub-kiloton nuclear weapons which are less likely to trigger a strategic nuclear exchange if used. In this eventuality, Russia could combine brinkmanship within Europe and destabilisation on NATO’s southern flank to pressure the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reconstitution of NATO’s own forces to meet the requirements of both deterrence and competition within this context will be shaped by relative uncertainty about the contours of Russia’s own trajectory. This paper, supported by the Royal Navy Strategic Studies Centre, seeks to answer a subordinate strategic question – what should the role be of the Alliance’s navies in strategic competition with Russia? The answer to this question will shape the contours of how both the Royal Navy and navies within NATO will evolve in the face of what could well be a long-term Russian threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors propose that, irrespective of its trajectory, Russia is likely to rely on its assets in the maritime domain for two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shaping the strategic balance, defined in Russian thinking as the relative throw-weight in both conventional and nuclear terms that two nations or alliances can deliver against each other’s homelands. In Russian parlance strategic forces are treated as distinct from general purpose (military) forces, though some capabilities, like ballistic missiles, can play both roles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Holding adversary maritime platforms capable of carrying long-range strike capabilities at reach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, this mirrors Cold War thinking about the maritime domain as being integrally intertwined with the nuclear balance. In the post-Cold War era, however, Russian leaders (including President Putin) have evinced a belief that many tasks which were previously only achievable with nuclear weapons can now be achieved with conventional precision-strike assets. Since long-range theatre-level strike assets (and kinetic defences against them) are easiest to move on large vessels, they remain a largely (though not exclusively) maritime capability in both Russia and the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A considerable body of literature exists to suggest that perceptions of the strategic balance influence coercive dynamics across the spectrum of competition. Moreover, to the extent that many of Russia’s most viable pathways to generating a credible future force structure rest on a favourable strategic balance, a threat to this would at a minimum require adaptation by Russia. Since many of the plausible adaptations for which Russia could opt are inherently capital intensive, this will impose resource trade-offs on Russian planners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In view of this, the authors contend that one of the primary vectors through which naval forces can deliver competitive overmatch regarding Russia is by fielding long-range land attack capabilities against which Russia will have to field additional defences. If this is combined with multiple launch vectors, the cost and expense of defence will undercut Russia’s potential future force designs and compel it to implement a series of force design choices that are counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, what this paper is proposing is that the navies of NATO play a role in a modern variant of flexible response. Part of the solution to the Alliance’s deterrence requirements will be recapitalising the ground forces that represent a key pillar of deterrence on the Alliance’s eastern flank. The defence plans of nations such as Poland, which include the purchase of both the Korean K239 Chunmoo multiple-launch rocket system and the US-made M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, stand out as a case in point. However, it is worth noting that the success of such plans will be contingent on the maintenance of stores of munitions and spares, as well as the ability of Alliance members to crew equipment. Maintaining the political capital to deliver equipment to forces on a sustained basis is a challenge within democracies, even in the face of acute threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maritime forces can play three important roles in this context. First, in peacetime, their employment can impose a requirement on Russia to expend resources on capabilities needed to deny the open ocean to NATO navies. This is viewed as a pressing requirement for the VMF and Russian aerospace forces, but one for which they have limited resources. Secondly, the employment of maritime forces can serve as a war termination tool by increasing the risks attendant on a protracted conflict in tandem with ground forces, which deny short-term gains. Finally, because many of the platforms which Russia employs for both strategic and sub-strategic nuclear use are either maritime or, like strategic bombers, can be impacted from the sea with conventional capabilities, a maritime threat to the bulk of Russia’s sub-strategic launch capability could considerably alter perceptions of a favourable strategic balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, this does not represent the full spectrum of functions which maritime power can play – the roles of navies can encompass a range of tasks, such as containing rival navies and providing armies with strategic mobility. This paper is more narrowly focused on those areas where maritime power can be applied asymmetrically as an offset to an opponent’s potential advantages in other areas, and as a tool for generating competitive advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main hypothesis of this paper is that in order to impose an asymmetry of cost on Russia, as well as to reinforce deterrence, Allied maritime power should not be framed in terms of deterrence by denial. Rather, its role should be viewed in terms of the strategic functions of pre-war shaping and war termination in the event that deterrence fails. Central to this will be two things: the ability to strike inland at reach; and the capacity to exacerbate Russia’s challenges with respect to generating ISR, and operating and contesting in the maritime domain beyond its coastal defensive zones. Underpinning the proposed approach to the employment of Allied maritime power is a focus on adversary concerns, rather than an effort to match capabilities. This is drawn from the tradition of competitive strategies innovated by figures such as Andrew Marshall at the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment in the 1970s. This paper discusses how Allied planning for the use of maritime power in the context of European deterrence can be placed within the context of a competitive strategies framework. This is distinct from threat-based planning insofar as it takes as its starting point the assumption that adversary investments can be shaped rather than merely countered. Secondly, given its long-term focus, a perspective based on competitive strategies emphasises exploiting asymmetry, exacerbating bottlenecks in an opponent’s capabilities rather than overmatching specific military threats directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is composed of four chapters, each of which will build towards a broad set of proposed lines of action for NATO navies. Chapter I focuses on Russia’s views of the primary threats that it faces from the maritime domain, and the opportunities that might emerge from a closer integration of these fears into Allied and national planning. Chapter II focuses on naval dynamics on NATO’s northern flank as a case study. Chapters III and IV examine the emerging opportunities for Allied planning in this area and the practical impediments – in both capability and policy terms – to the adoption of a “competitive strategies” approach to the application of Allied maritime power in competition with Russia, as well as the ways in which these might be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors reviewed a combination of sources, including Russian military literature and academic analysis of the maritime balance between NATO and Russia, as part of their research for this paper. In addition, one of the authors has direct experience of operating in two different navies within the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-russian-threats-and-allied-opportunities&quot;&gt;I. Russian Threats and Allied Opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia views itself as possessing some opportunities within the maritime domain, Russian strategists tend to frame it as a threat vector. This is relatively understandable given the country’s traditional weaknesses in this domain. Broadly speaking, Russian literature evinces several potential concerns within the maritime domain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of the maritime domain as a launch vector for adversary long-range precision fires against the Russian homeland.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Efforts by rivals to challenge Russia’s ability to exploit its resource base within the maritime domain, particularly in the High North and Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Threats to Russia’s second-strike strategic nuclear capability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first concern can be nested within a broader set of Russian concerns regarding the risk of a precision-strike campaign against the Russian homeland conducted on multiple axes. The fear that Russia could effectively be paralysed by Western long-range precision strike capabilities emerged partially as the result of a specific reading of the conflicts of the 1990s. A key lesson of the first Gulf War and the Balkan Wars derived by figures such as the then Soviet deputy chief of general staff of the armed forces, General Makhmut Gareev, and the deputy commander of the Soviet Navy, Admiral Ivan Kapitanets, was the notion that precision strike made it possible to paralyse a state’s capacity to mount an effective military response by simultaneously targeting the depth of an opponent’s territory. Though not an exclusively naval function, it has been assumed by several Russian strategists that naval platforms will represent a crucial launch vector for the long-range precision strike threat. This is a reasonable assumption, as the size of missiles such as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) makes launching them from platforms other than naval more complex (though not impossible).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain maritime platforms also have a second advantage which is of particular concern to Russian military writers: their capacity to launch strikes at close range, which would leave Russia with limited early warning. This specific threat is of course particular to certain types of launch platforms such as SSN and SSGN submarines, which can, in principle, remain undetected and strike from positions close to Russian shores at short notice. The present Russian concern regarding air and missile threats mirrors those voiced during the Soviet era, when genuine concerns about being subjected to a nuclear first strike were compounded by inter-organisational dynamics. A combination of factors contributed to this, among them the strategic culture, which created pervasive fears of surprise attack, and organisational dynamics within the USSR that saw organisations such as the Soviet Air Defence Forces competing for resources, which they could do more effectively when they could make the case that an external threat justified their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemporary Russian thinking about an aerospace assault is somewhat broader and assumes simultaneous strikes against C2 nodes, critical infrastructure airfields and nuclear assets. Russian theorists presume that the launch of missiles moving at different speeds, such as UAV decoys and cruise missiles, can be sequenced to provide a coordinated time on top or convergent effect. This is certainly technically achievable – Russia has coordinated the use of Shahed-136 loitering munitions and Kalibr cruise missiles in this way, and Iran combined cruise missiles and UAVs in its 2019 strikes on Abqaiq and Khurais.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, then, priorities such as air defence have featured heavily in recent Russian procurement. For example, under the state armament programme for 2020, the Russian Federation was expected to procure 56 S-400 division sets, which, at a cost of $200 million per battery, would be comparable to a carrier programme. Moreover, Russia has placed an ever-greater emphasis on building and fielding the precision strike capabilities needed to conduct offensive counter-air missions against targets such as airbases. This has been combined with efforts to recapitalise Russia’s capacity for airborne situational awareness in areas such as the High North. In addition to deploying assets such as the MiG-31BM to the region, Russia maintains at least three S-300 and S-400 regiments under its Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command, along with the Murmansk-BN electronic warfare complex and a growing radar network in areas such as Kotelny (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bMq9i3s.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second major Russian concern which emerges primarily from the maritime domain is the fear that Russia’s SSBN bastions can be penetrated. This was an especially pressing consideration for the Soviet Union during the late Cold War, and drove considerable investments in securing the USSR’s bastions in the High North. Today, factors such as the melting of polar ice caps that will allow greater access to the area will exacerbate this concern, as the growth in merchant traffic is likely to mask any increased military presence, making it more difficult for Russia to produce its recognised maritime picture and deter would-be ingressors into its historical bastions. This issue has been noted by, among others, Admiral Nikolai Yemenov, commander-in-chief of the VMF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability of Russia to maintain situational awareness in the undersea domain represents another bottleneck in capacity and capability. Much of the responsibility for the task of maintaining sub-surface domain awareness falls to the Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research (Glavnoye Upravlenie Glubokovodnikh Issledovanii, or GUGI). This organisation has historically depended on a highly specialised cadre of hydronauts for its operations, drawn from the ranks of the VMF via the 29th Separate Submarine brigade. It also relies on several special purpose submarines, such as the deep-diving submarine Losharik, which is launched from the Belgorod, a specially adapted stretched Oscar-class submarine. Under the leadership of Vice-Admiral Aleksei Burilichev, the GUGI took on several additional tasks, including the testing of the Poseidon nuclear torpedo. On the one hand, this represented a budgetary advantage, but it simultaneously represented a cost in terms of both submariners’ time and the use of its platforms. Currently, the organisation likely faces more tasks than its platforms and personnel can manage, with its duties including undersea surveillance, the management of Harmony (Russia’s analogue to the US Integrated Undersea Surveillance System), and more offensive functions such as espionage. This strain on availability of platforms was further compounded by a 2019 fire on the Losharik. Russia’s current emphasis on less survivable but also less costly platforms, such as the intelligence ship Yantar, and the search for autonomous solutions, may reflect these challenges. These approaches could bear fruit, but capabilities such as autonomous underwater vehicles are likely to demand investments in areas such as high-end microelectronics, which Russia can only procure at cost and at some sanctions risk to vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the risk of a distant blockade of the Russian Federation’s maritime lines of communication, which will be exacerbated by the use of “grey” shipping that can be legally interdicted in peacetime for lack of adequate insurance or flag verification, among other things. Russia is in some ways especially vulnerable to blockade. Its trade-to-GDP ratio is currently higher than that of most Western nations, and the majority of this trade is carried by sea. Though land-based infrastructure and transhipment through neutral ports can mitigate this vulnerability to an extent, it can do so only inefficiently and, moreover, at a cost in both money and material. For example, a proposed North–South Corridor moving Russian goods to the Indian Ocean via Iran would both be a high-risk investment (which is why it must be state-backed) and involve goods passing through volatile regions and states such as Azerbaijan, with which both Russia and Iran have a fraught relationship. Some Russian authors have voiced concerns that the Russian state’s increasing reliance on grey shipping will create vulnerabilities to peacetime interdiction. In a conflict scenario, much of Russia’s energy exports, among other things, will depend on sea lines of communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the need to meet requirements such as protecting bastions and sea lines of communication, as well as contributing to objectives such as offensive counter-air missions, the VMF has secured a sizeable proportion of Russia’s defence budget over the last decades: it received a 26% allocation under the last state armament plan, as compared to 14% for ground forces. Despite this fiscal allocation, the ability of Russia’s ageing maritime sector to meet the demands placed on it is in question. The recent budget announcement that more than a third of Russia’s total budget expenditure in 2024 will go to defence will not ease this, as the main emphasis of this increase is focused on the delivery of victory in Ukraine, meaning that predominantly the land environment and the Army will benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-trade-offs-facing-russia&quot;&gt;The Trade-Offs Facing Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some challenges are easier for Russia to mitigate than others. While Russia can achieve sea denial and a degree of sea control in its coastal seas, contesting freedom of action out to 1,000 km and beyond will be difficult and costly for a country that must also rebuild its forces on land. For example, Russia has struggled to build its Pion and Lotos satellite constellations and thus has limited situational awareness at reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue for Russia is twofold. First, as previously noted, platform development in the maritime domain is inherently capital intensive, and this is especially true for those platforms that are needed to contest more distant waters. While it is difficult to ascertain the costs of platforms such as the Ilyushin Il-38 aircraft or the Yasen-class submarine with a high degree of certainty (though public figures do exist for the Yasen), proxy indicators can be utilised. For example, during the Cold War the CIA used a methodology which focused on the relative costs of platforms, rather than on their absolute costs. Essentially, the relative production cost of two different systems was established using Western analogues. Though imperfect, the assumption underpinning this mode of comparison was that while the absolute costs of two different platforms might vary across states, the relative costs were more stable and dependant on physical characteristics such as tonnage and power density (for vessels) or factors such as weight and speed (for aircraft), and because factors such as labour costs that might impact absolute costs would not impact relative costs. Using this rubric, the costs of the platforms needed for Russia to contest areas beyond its immediate close seas are prohibitive. For example, a Yasen-class submarine should cost roughly as much as the armour organic to a force such as the First Guards Tank Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second factor worth considering is how much a given system depends on foreign inputs, including machine tooling and microelectronics. In this case, there is likely to be a direct correlation between the reach of a platform or effector and its dependence on imports. Effectors such as long-range missiles depend on Western inputs to achieve precision at reach. Similarly, the larger the platform, the more it is likely to require in terms of resources such as machine tooling, much of which is imported. Estimating sophistication is a relatively imprecise art, though more is now known about the degree to which certain effectors (in particular missiles) rely on Western capabilities. One proxy, borrowed from civilian economics, is to use the average GDP of countries that produce a given product as a barometer of its sophistication and thus its reliance on high-tech imports if the country producing the product falls below the average. The percentage of industrial capacity in areas where Russia has external dependencies on which a given area of military spending draws is another measure which can be employed. By these metrics, capabilities such as SSNs, strategic bombers, long-range strike capabilities and air defence systems are all likely to be demanding in terms of external inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintenance costs are another area of interest. During the Cold War it was presumed (correctly) that the poor quality of Soviet aircraft maintenance meant that the through-life costs of Soviet aircraft would exceed those of their Western counterparts in absolute terms, even if their capital costs did not. This is more likely to be true the more sophisticated the platform, thus impacting naval and air platforms in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we might consider personnel. More sophisticated platforms tend to draw on skilled personnel, both for manufacture and subsequent manning. To the extent that skilled and educated personnel represent a capability bottleneck which will be exacerbated by emigration, platforms drawing on such individuals will compete with other elements of the force that require skilled personnel. This could include, for example, operators for air defences and C2 systems such as Akatsia-M. Of course, defence could outcompete other sectors for remaining skilled personnel, but only at the cost of creating distortions elsewhere. While Russia has embraced the integration of autonomous and uncrewed systems into all aspects of warfare throughout its operations in Ukraine, it retains a lack of trust towards machines and full autonomy. It continues to fund research into AI but, again, it is not a world leader in this field and therefore lags behind the West in these areas which could potentially solve some of the crewing issues faced by militaries around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Russia has shown a great deal of sensitivity to the maritime domain as a threat vector, and its leadership has displayed a willingness to expend considerable resources on attempting to secure the nation’s maritime flanks. However, this represents an opportunity cost for the rest of the Russian military in several ways. First, maritime platforms are inherently capital intensive and require inputs in precisely those areas where Russia has considerable weaknesses. Moreover, maintaining capabilities such as air defences sufficient to close off Russia’s maritime approaches requires Russia to strip them from other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with this level of expenditure, significant challenges remain for Russia. One Russian analyst has suggested that the Russian armed forces had a third of the resources needed to secure the country’s maritime approaches, while considerable debates have taken place within Russia regarding the need for power projection platforms. Furthermore, gaps remain in Russia’s air and sea denial capabilities in areas such as the High North.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-case-study-naval-dynamics-on-natos-northern-flank&quot;&gt;II. Case Study: Naval Dynamics on NATO’s Northern Flank&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian position in the High North is a useful case study. While Russia has invested considerable effort in reinforcing its military position in the region, it nonetheless faces certain critical gaps in capability that could prove to be enduring. If Russia were to invest in resolving these challenges, it would necessarily have to do so at the expense of other parts of its force structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though not identical to its Soviet predecessor, the VMF’s conception of its role, including in this region, is similar. A primary wartime function of the Soviet fleet was the defence of SSBNs in their bastions, because the leadership of the USSR perceived the balance of nuclear power at the end of a conflict to be a critical determinant of bargaining power at the point of conflict termination. The assumptions underpinning this concept remain for Russia today. To this end, the Soviets organised their fleet for the defence of three zones: a coastal defence zone within 200 km of Russia’s shores; a near seas zone within 1,000 km; and a far seas zone up to 2,000 km from Russia. At a minimum, Russian forces should be able to dominate the coastal defence zone and achieve sea denial in the near seas and far seas zones. Russian strategists do not, however, perceive their role in purely reactive terms – one way in which Soviet SSNs were to contribute to shaping war termination dynamics was by actively hunting adversary SSBNs. Today, Russia views the balances which will determine the circumstances of war termination as including adversary conventional long-range precision strike capabilities, given the increased lethality of the latter against command nodes, logistical facilities and nuclear assets themselves. As such, at a minimum it will be a standing requirement for Russian naval forces in the High North and Arctic both to prevent platforms capable of holding long-range strike capabilities from entering into the Arctic, including denial of access to the oceans directly abutting it (from where long-range strike capabilities can be launched with limited warning), and to eliminate adversary platforms on the open oceans where possible. The ability of Russia’s forces to achieve this, however, may be constrained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first area in which Russia will face considerable capability gaps in the High North is anti-submarine warfare (ASW). Though Russia’s Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command maintains a sizeable force of both conventional and nuclear attack submarines, its capacity for defensive ASW is somewhat more constrained. Russia’s fleet of 44 Ilyushin Il-38N and Tupolev Tu-142 maritime patrol aircraft, though not small by any standard, is split between the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command and the Pacific Fleet. Moreover, it is considerably more limited than the maritime patrol aircraft force that Russian planners intended to have at their disposal – the VMF had aspired to field 30 Il-38Ns by 2020, in addition to its fleet of Tu-142s. Factors such as readiness must be taken into account, and there are certain trends which will compound the problems posed by the lack of airborne surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the Russian surface fleet’s capacity to support ASW is also becoming increasingly constrained. The Udaloy II-class destroyer – the backbone of the Soviet Navy’s and then the VMF’s surface ASW capabilities – is likely reaching the point of obsolescence. While new surface platforms such as the Admiral Gorshkov-class frigate can provide a newer and more capable replacement, Russia’s production of the Gorshkov class has faced considerable delays, driven by both the limitations of Russia’s indigenous shipbuilding base and its loss of access to gas turbine engines (which it procured from Ukraine) after 2014. Compounding this are considerable overruns in the repair and refit of existing vessels such as the Kirov-class cruiser Admiral Nakhimov. Russia can continue to build vessels such as the Gorshkov-class frigates, but it will face capacity constraints. To cite one example, the Russian effort to develop combined diesel and gas engines to replace Ukrainian imports has delivered eventual success, but Russia is restricted to the production of two such engines a year, and even this rate of production may prove difficult to sustain. A major bottleneck will be capacity at Russian shipyards, which are currently running at capacity. Compounding this is the need for import substitution: the Kolomna D49 diesel engine which forms part of the M55R power unit includes several imported components that will be increasingly difficult for Russia to procure in the face of export controls. Given that the engines on naval vessels are subject to a wear rate when they are at sea, spare part restrictions can also impact the operational tempo of existing vessels. Sanctions evasion is of course possible, but this imposes additional fiscal costs on already expensive programmes. Finally, wider challenges faced by Russian civilian shipbuilding mean that civilian and military projects may, to an extent, compete for the same resources, particularly with respect to personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the airbases upon which Russian assets rely – assets such as the Tu-22M3 bomber and the Il-38N, which are crucial to denying access to surface vessels and submarines respectively – are vulnerable to air attack, as was recently demonstrated in the Ukrainian attacks on the Engels airbase. The size of the fixed-wing aircraft being deployed from these bases makes the use of hardened air shelters or dispersion impractical. While some security can be provided using airbases deeper within Russia, this comes at a cost in terms of presence and endurance (and many of these airbases can be threatened from other vectors). Russia can mitigate these challenges, but only through the employment of a robust regional air defence network. It currently maintains such a network in the form of three S-300 and S-400 regiments under OSK Sever. In addition to this, the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command maintains an electronic warfare centre at Severomorsk, which controls electronic warfare complexes such as the Murmansk-BN and the Krasukha-4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways in which this picture can become considerably more complex for Russia. First, the changing climate in the High North might considerably expand the areas which the VMF must survey and thus deny to adversary assets. In particular, changes that make seasonal circumpolar navigation easier for subsurface assets will complicate the task of ASW in the High North and Arctic. Similar changes will also make ingress by submarines into the Arctic from the east possible to a degree that was not previously viable, both by Russian adversaries (NATO) and, potentially in the future, by China, which will complicate the water space further for Russia. Moreover, detecting submarines in the region will be complicated by factors such as the increase in temperature of the Arctic Ocean and changes in salinity that will affect sound channels, greater ambient oceanic noise due to increases in oceanic wildlife, open-ocean storms (where there used to be ice), and increases in the movement of sea ice as the ice cap breaks up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second risk to Russia’s conceived approach to oceanic defence is posed by the increasing range of strike assets. For example, the common hypersonic glide body intended for use by the US Army and Navy has a 4,000 km range, which would allow it to have an effect over much of western Russia from the Norwegian Sea. Moreover, strike platforms such as hypersonics and land attack cruise missiles, which exist at the high end of the cost continuum, are joined by considerably cheaper long-range strike assets. As an example, consider one-way attack UAVs, such as the Iranian-made Shahed-136, which have a theoretical range of 2,000 km. While limited in terms of sensors and payload, such munitions can be of use against soft targets such as administrative buildings, or targets which are inherently incendiary such as fuel or munitions stocks. At least one recent Russian study has noted that the munitions expenditure involved in engaging UAVs as well as the detection challenges they pose represent serious air defence challenges. The challenge of range for the VMF is that it forces the VMF to sortie out to engage platforms which can pose a threat from well beyond Russia’s bastions, and thus places a higher premium on Tier 1 platforms that can operate on open oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third risk facing Russia is that of the changing strategic geography of the northern flank spurred by NATO’s enlargement. First, this will spur a convergence between regions such as the Baltic and the High North. This challenge is inextricable from that of range. A sufficiently long-ranged strike munition such as the TLAM could impact many of the same regions from either the Norwegian Sea or the Baltic Sea, but the proximity to Russia of the latter region relative to the former means that strikes from within the Baltic Sea could occur with limited warning times, while missiles fired from further afield could arrive as a follow-on capability. This creates multiple avenues for convergent strikes from multiple vectors. Though Russia can more easily deny parts of the Baltic Sea with ground-based missiles in Kaliningrad, this is less true of the littorals of nations such as Sweden. Much of Russia’s capacity for denial depends on closing the straits of Denmark, which will prove difficult if NATO vessels are posturing in a crisis short of war, especially when a number of NATO members are on the other side of the straits. Secondly, the proximity of NATO’s northern flank to Russian strategic bastions means that strike capabilities which might have been classed as tactical can have a strategic effect. An ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) missile in Finland, for example, has strategic ramifications, as does an aircraft which might have been viewed as a tactical capability. If contending purely with ground-based assets, this might actually incentivise Russia to pre-empt before platforms can be dispersed. A maritime dimension to deterrence can remove this incentive by introducing strike assets which cannot be as easily pre-empted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the risk that the Alliance can enforce a distant blockade on the Russian Federation, which must still move energy from areas such as the Arctic through chokepoints in both the east (in the form of the Bering Strait) and the west (through the GIUK Gap). Overland alternatives do exist, but their capacity is likely to be considerably constrained. Moreover, most overland methods of circumventing a blockade, such as pipelines or routes to alternative terminals, are resource-intensive endeavours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Russia can mitigate each of these challenges. It is not yet clear that NATO has the capacity to present the Russian leadership with the challenges that its maritime doctrine is partially based around mitigating. However, it is the authors’ contention that the Alliance has avenues through which to adapt its maritime posture in a 10-year timeframe in order to present Russia with an asymmetrical offset to the advantages that it may enjoy on land in terms of both mass and proximity to likely theatres. Moreover, the development of these avenues can force Russia into disproportionately costly mitigations, which will impose opportunity costs elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-emerging-opportunities-for-allied-planning&quot;&gt;III. Emerging Opportunities for Allied Planning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge that Russia faces in the maritime domain can be summarised as follows. In order to be strategically secure enough to pursue a full spectrum of competitive actions including escalation to local and regional conflict, Russia must deny the maritime domain out to 1,000 km. All of the platforms and enablers that might allow Russia to achieve this are, by their nature, inherently complex. The surveillance and reconnaissance needed to cue conventional missiles at reach have thus far not been developed by Russia, while aerial and maritime platforms operating at long distances do so at considerable risk. As such, to the extent that the Alliance can expand the area over which Russia must achieve sea denial in order to protect itself against long-range strikes, it can shape the contours of Russian force regeneration. It can achieve this primarily in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By expanding its long-range land attack capability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By operating on new vectors that Russia has not historically had to defend.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the assets of Alliance members can be postured in ways that incentivise Russian responses at reach. For example, exercises at or just beyond the Russian near seas zone focused specifically on strike, comparable to exercises such as Formidable Shield (which focuses on Integrated Air and Missile Defence), would in all likelihood compel responses. We might, for example, consider the relationship between NATO’s Trident Juncture and the scale of Russia’s Ocean Shield exercises, which consistently track one another. This is an asymmetrical challenge for Russia, which is operating fewer and older hulls, but it would also compel Russian leaders to plan in terms of their existing fears regarding strikes from the northern vector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Russia views this challenge in multi-theatre terms, sequencing exercises by NATO and those conducted by member states such as the US in the Indo-Pacific could act as a forcing function to compel even larger-scale responses by Russia. This was the case during the Cold War, when the Soviet Navy felt compelled to stage multi-theatre exercises, such as Okean, to demonstrate its ability to operate across theatres. The cost of such activity in both human terms and platform wear can have an indirect effect on Russia’s ability to project power elsewhere, especially in a context where recent state armament plans have prioritised surface vessels with limited endurance, and given the age and reliability issues facing many larger platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other ways for the Alliance to increase the strain on Russian forces that are constrained by both vessel age and human capital. For example, forward activity by Allied SSNs, particularly on transpolar routes, would create an imperative to maintain more persistent surveillance over a considerably wider area. Russian efforts to maintain situational awareness in these areas would be non-discretionary, both because of the importance of these zones for patrolling SSBNs and because Russia’s air defences over the central Arctic are relatively sparse, underscoring the risk of key air defence radar being suppressed by submarine-launched cruise missiles to open the way for other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, sea control at key chokepoints could be underscored through exercises which emphasise interdiction for other reasons. For example, exercises framed in terms of the need to interdict threats to critical infrastructure or to counter illicit activity would, if conducted at or near strategic chokepoints, have an implicit effect in terms of messaging. Unlike larger-scale exercises, which often take years to plan, such activity could be conducted on a more routine basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-practical-impediments-to-a-competitive-strategies-approach-and-ways-to-overcome-them&quot;&gt;IV. Practical Impediments to a “Competitive Strategies” Approach and Ways to Overcome Them&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several challenges inherent in an approach that is designed to compete in the way described above. Among them are potential risks to strategic stability and the positions of different NATO Alliance members with regard to a forward-leaning maritime posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first risk, that strategic stability could be upended if Russia perceives a risk to its own critical capabilities, is one that political leaders across the Alliance would understandably wish to avoid. There are several ways in which this risk might manifest itself. First, a Russia that perceived risks to its C2 (including its nuclear C2), second strike or other critical capabilities might well have incentives to escalate early in a crisis. Secondly, the nature of certain elements of a competitive strategy, such as the forward posturing of subsurface assets, could lead to challenges such as the loss of communications and thus control; this issue arose during the Cold War when American SSNs such as the Gato conducted operations near the Soviet coastline, an activity that carried inherent escalatory risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first challenge, while real, can also be stabilising in certain respects. If, as a precondition for military action, Russia had to posture forces in a way that insured it against a crippling first strike, this would, in principle, limit its avenues for limited military action. Any escalation would need to be accompanied by a set of actions which in turn would make it difficult for the Russian leadership to communicate limited intent, and would thus only be justifiable in extremis. Moreover, it should be noted that the very proximity of NATO’s borders to Russia and the possibility of long-range strike being surged in a crisis creates a pre-emptive logic for Russia irrespective of maritime strategy. Indeed, the relative viability of suppressing targets such as aircraft on the ground, given the concentration of Allied aircraft in generally unhardened airbases, would incentivise this. The relative difficulty of pre-emptively suppressing maritime platforms with conventional capabilities except when in port would remove some incentives for conventional pre-emption which might exist against ground-based platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it is worth noting that the authors are not suggesting that in an escalating crisis, Western states should opt to engage in strikes against the Russian homeland on the scale that Russia fears. Rather, the proposition is that uncertainty regarding whether this might occur, if engendered in peacetime, can have a positive competitive effect. Perhaps most importantly, however, it is already the case that Russia appears intent on developing a range of capabilities, such as the Poseidon nuclear torpedo and the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, which are built to insure it against a crippling first strike. If this is indeed the case, then it is not obvious that instability is avoidable. Rather, what appears more likely to be shaped by Western policy is the degree to which Russia invests in such capabilities, rather than taking other avenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second challenge – namely, Alliance cohesion – is considerable, especially in areas such as the High North, where some members of the Alliance are likely to be heavily invested in regional stability for entirely understandable reasons. It should be noted that this would not necessarily be the first instance in which debates over Allied posture have proved divisive; NATO’s shift to a flexible response posture and the later adoption of the Follow-on Forces Attack doctrine were also accompanied by controversy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several avenues which might be pursued as mitigations. First, in the vein of NATO’s Harmel formula, deterrence can be combined with engagement, whereby reciprocal de-escalatory actions by Russia can be matched in kind. For example, the tempo of Allied SSN activity in the High North might be linked to Russian activity near Allied undersea cables. Linking activity with engagement can allay some Allied fears. Secondly, some of the capabilities described would impact the High North even if not postured in the region on a long-term basis. Maritime platforms hosting strike assets such as hypersonics, for example, can pose a theoretical threat from well beyond areas such as the Norwegian Sea. As such, they need not be persistently forward postured, and their intermittent presence need be viewed no differently from the occasional deployments of strategic bombers to the region. Since the mobility of air and maritime assets allows for relatively rapid posturing, the Russian leadership is likely to view the balance of precision strike capabilities as being determined by the number of missiles each side possesses, rather than those regionally postured. Thus, forward deployment in ways that pose a challenge to Alliance cohesion may in many instances be unnecessary. This would not be equally true of other activities, such as subsurface activity along the Northern Sea Route; however, such activity is likely to involve a limited subset of Allied navies in any instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subset of challenges relates to military capacity. In many of the areas described, including long-range strike capabilities and subsurface assets, members of the Alliance will face their own considerable shortfalls in capacity. To use an example, the UK currently has a single launch vector for deep strikes inland from the maritime domain – namely the TLAM launched from the Astute-class submarine. This challenge will likely be compounded by the eventuality that a large proportion of the capabilities fielded by the US will be reallocated to the Indo-Pacific theatre to contend with an increasingly capable People’s Liberation Army Navy. The Alliance will also face shortfalls in other areas, such as submarines capable of operating under ice, and limitations to the human capital available across Allied navies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted, however, that considering the present operating circumstances which Russia faces, it is likely that capabilities needed to compete effectively with the Russian Federation in the medium term will be needed in a 10-year timeframe and beyond. As such, Allied maritime capabilities can be viewed in the same vein as virtually any other category of capability, such as munitions – while present shortfalls in production capacity are real, there is a window in which they might be rectified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A relatively quick way in which members of the Alliance could increase Russian uncertainty regarding the scale of the precision-strike threat is by experimenting with the use of air defence interceptors in a dual-capable role. This has already been the case with the SM-2 and SM-6 missiles, and while there are many technical reasons why interceptors may not be the best means of striking targets at reach, the fact that Russian planners already presume that they will play this role means that they will have to be factored into planning regarding the strike threat to soft-skinned targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The containerisation of subsonic munitions both by Russia and more recently by the US Marine Corps suggests that at least some strike assets could be emplaced on non-dedicated platforms in a crisis, or deployed ashore in an escalating crisis. This would also be the case for attritable one-way attack UAVs, which can be containerised in larger numbers. Though unlikely to pose a threat to hardened targets, such capabilities are regarded by Russia as posing a credible threat to targets such as airfields, on which strategic capabilities such as ASW aircraft and bombers are based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch platforms for bespoke capabilities such as hypersonics are likely to pose more of a challenge, given the lengths of the strike cells needed. Presently, only the US Navy’s payload-module-equipped Virginia-class submarines could plausibly carry long-range hypersonic missiles, and any competitive approach in Europe will depend on the presence of at least some of these assets within European waters. This being said, there are relatively few targets that are either so heavily hardened or so fleeting that they demand the use of a hypersonic missile. In a 10-year timeframe, this could change, as European navies such as the Royal Navy seek to integrate hypersonics on future platforms such as the SSN(R). The fact that ground-based versions of naval hypersonics which fit within 40-foot container-sized launchers are also being developed holds out the option of deploying missiles ashore from amphibious shipping, rather than firing them from vessels. If concerns regarding emissions and heat can be mitigated, container-based hypersonics can also be integrated on non-bespoke platforms. As an example, we might consider how the Israeli Lora SRBM has been containerised and operated from a non-dedicated vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Russian defence planning is programmed on a 10-year basis, the choices that the Russian state makes for investments out to a 10-year time horizon are dependent on the force structures that it may expect to face. With respect to the missiles themselves, the primary barrier will be R&amp;amp;D costs, and there is some reason to believe that a model comparable to the F-35 – with manufacturing distributed, but intellectual property held by states that have moved ahead of the pack – should be the basis for work on hypersonics envisioned via the AUKUS (Australia, UK and US) defence partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forward SSN operations could prove much more challenging, given that most SSN fleets are unlikely to grow in the next decade, and the demand on the US Navy in the Indo-Pacific is likely to increase. Past the next decade, this challenge may be alleviated somewhat, but this is uncertain. Uncrewed solutions may offer an offset to limited hulls, and uncrewed capabilities have the potential to be used in similar roles, but with a different concept of employment to the standard SSNs of today. First, autonomous vessels can be used for forward surveillance, and have already been used in this capacity by states such as China. While this poses a risk of platforms being captured, it also allows for intelligence gathering without the escalatory risks that the use of crewed assets near hostile shores posed during the Cold War. Moreover, the task of tracking subsurface contacts, whether crewed or not, would be one that imposes burdens on Russian ASW assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, uncrewed capabilities can be used for tasks such as forward minelaying, and as active sonar emitters in forward positions, which can enable passive detection by more valuable crewed platforms. This is important since one of the reasons that SSNs need other platforms to perform wide area searches is that they cannot afford to emit themselves. Rather than operating in an anti-SSBN role, NATO’s SSNs could act as a forward perimeter. This could impose dilemmas on Russia when viewed in conjunction with the imperative that long-range strike creates for Russian SSNs to sortie beyond their bastions: if strike creates imperatives for SSNs and SSGNs to be utilised in risk-acceptant ways, mines and uncrewed capabilities teamed with smaller numbers of crewed platforms will be able to ambush them in forward positions. The resultant dilemma is one that Russian planners will not easily contend with in a crisis. On the other hand, the complexities of communicating underwater make the direct control of uncrewed underwater vehicles as armed complements to crewed submarines difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, however, the question in each instance will be whether the capabilities developed can impose more costs than those required to develop them in the first place. In this, the Alliance will have the advantage of knowing that Russia will have to develop mitigations premised on a worst-case scenario. As illustrated by Russian literature that consistently overemphasises the scale at which the Alliance can generate long-range strikes, and by both Russian and Soviet responses to prior changes in Alliance posture, it is conceivable that even marginal investments in the areas described will impose disproportionately costly adaptations on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s reactive application of maritime power does not currently translate into strategic effects, but with three subtle changes it could. Firstly, it could do so through the creation of an environment that forces Russia to expend resources on capabilities needed to deny the open ocean to NATO navies; secondly, the employment of maritime forces can serve as a war termination tool by increasing the costs of a protracted conflict in tandem with ground forces, which deny short-term gains; and finally, because many of the platforms which Russia uses for sub-strategic nuclear use are either maritime or, like strategic bombers, can be impacted from the sea with conventional capabilities, a maritime threat to the bulk of Russia’s sub-strategic launch capability can considerably alter perceptions of a favourable strategic balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maritime power has historically been an asymmetrical advantage for the Alliance vis-à-vis Russia, and it can continue to play this role. Russia’s concepts for defending its maritime periphery commit it to a posture which can only be sustained by platforms that are capital intensive – precisely the type of capability that Russia is least well-situated to generate. By investing in capabilities in areas such as long-range strike, the Alliance can exacerbate the challenges which Russia faces. This, in turn, means that the way Allied maritime power is conceived should be a function of what can be delivered ashore from the sea (which is what Russian leaders primarily worry about), rather than seizing sea control per se.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has several concerns about the use of maritime that could be exploited by NATO. Firstly, there is the threat to Russia’s second-strike capability. Russia views the use of the maritime domain as a launch vector for adversary long-range precision fires into the heart of the Russian homeland, including critical national infrastructure, airbases and strategic strike capabilities. It has therefore sought to improve surface-to-air missile coverage and situational awareness through increased radar sites across the High North in an effort to detect and deter potential aggression from this vector. Secondly, Russia’s traditional concerns regarding the safety of its second strike may be exacerbated by the impact of climate change. Thirdly, Russia fears the risk of a distant blockade of the Russian Federation’s maritime lines of communication, not only in the Baring Strait/GIUK Gap but also in the Baltic, the Black Sea and into the Pacific. Overland import/export routes are costly and rely on good relationships with neighbouring nations, something that cannot be guaranteed, and therefore lacks potential investors. This is further exacerbated by the use of grey shipping, which has ways of being legally interdicted in peacetime. Without steady access to engines and spares, Russia’s ability to maintain its fleets and maritime squadrons will be significantly called into question, leaving the maritime areas open to further exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These concerns can be exploited by NATO to create strategic advantages. The Alliance can use a threat to shift the strategic balance in its favour in several ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By shaping Russian leaders’ pre-conflict assessments of their ability (or lack thereof) to control a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By shifting the allocation of scarce resources towards costly mitigations such as air defences and platforms capable of contesting distant seas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By setting the conditions for war termination if deterrence fails and initial denial is achieved on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fear of Allied maritime power has historically provoked counter-reactions by Russia. As a lack of response would imply a weakening in Russia’s stance internally, a response to any NATO action is typically thought necessary. These counter-reactions are financially costly and increase the strain on Russian forces, which are constrained by both vessel age and human capital. The cost of such activity in both human terms and platform wear can have an indirect effect on Russia’s ability to project power elsewhere. The forward posturing of Allied subsurface assets and circumpolar transits represent two avenues through which this kind of outcome might be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO should, however, recognise its own shortfalls, including the subset of challenges related to military capacity. In many of the areas described, including long-range strike capabilities and subsurface assets, members of the Alliance will face their own considerable shortfalls in capacity. There are certain ways in which the Alliance can rationalise its approach to producing precision strike capabilities. The first might be an emphasis on commonality of capabilities – something already visible in initiatives to increase the Alliance’s capacity in areas such as air defence. Allied efforts to co-produce existing effectors rather than develop multiple independent types could yield considerable efficiencies; the emphasis of AUKUS Pillar 2 on fielding hypersonics could serve as the first step for a wider Allied effort in this regard. The Alliance will also face shortfalls in other areas that will necessitate the preparation of their navies to operate on a warfighting basis against a well-defined threat. Capabilities needed to compete effectively with the Russian Federation in the medium term will need to be fielded in a 10-year timeframe and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second likely concern – a lack of platforms to hold strike assets – could be mitigated in several ways, including through the containerisation of subsonic munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, different approaches to ASW could expand the threat envelope for opponents. Though hardly a panacea, uncrewed solutions such as uncrewed underwater vehicles can be used for tasks such as emplacing mines in forward positions within bastions, as well as for forward surveillance. A combination of the machine learning tools that make low-frequency active sonar (previously too riddled with false positives to be used as a tactical asset) a viable means of detection at reach could allow a combination of distant platforms used for detection to cue in more attritable ones in their final approach, without the requirement to risk SSNs forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each instance, the key consideration will be whether capabilities developed can impose more costs than those required to develop them in the first place, which should be the key determinant of Allied policy in the maritime domain.&lt;/p&gt;

There is an urgent need for intervention given Africa’s population of 1.4 billion is forecasted to reach 2.5 billion by 2050, which, when coupled with rising incomes and urbanization, will lead to a significant increase in energy demand. This brief provides six evidence-based insights on Africa’s energy landscape before providing five recommendations on reaching universal energy access amid global decarbonization.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;africas-energy-landscape&quot;&gt;AFRICA’S ENERGY LANDSCAPE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy is a significant impediment to economic development in Africa. In 2022, 546 million people in Africa lived in poverty — roughly half of the continent’s population — indicating an urgent need to drive economic growth by creating employment, an endeavor that is impossible without energy access. The continent consumes a disproportionately low amount of energy, accounting for less than 6 percent of global energy consumption despite hosting 18 percent of the world’s population. When excluding South Africa, sub-Saharan Africa’s per capita energy consumption is just 180 kilowatt hours (kWh), compared to 6,500 in Europe and 13,000 kWh in the United States. There is an urgent need to increase the supply of clean energy given Africa’s rapidly growing population. The following are six evidence-based insights on Africa’s energy landscape; these insights provide the foundation for the recommendations on how to reach universal energy access in a way that is most congruent with the world’s emission reductions goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;insight-1-demand-is-significantly-outstripping-supply-and-the-energy-crisis-is-deepening&quot;&gt;Insight 1: Demand is significantly outstripping supply, and the energy crisis is deepening.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the progress made in the past five years toward increasing access to electricity has been reversed due to population growth outpacing electrification rates, supply chain disruptions, and the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic for both households and governments. In 2021, there were 4 percent more people in sub-Saharan Africa without access to electricity compared to 2019. Meanwhile, almost three-quarters of Africa’s population does not have access to clean cooking facilities. Recent spikes in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) prices have made this option unaffordable for nearly 30 million people in Africa, forcing many to switch back to polluting cooking fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the fastest-growing African countries have the highest levels of energy poverty. Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are among the five fastest-growing countries in the world. Nigeria has been experiencing an energy crisis for decades, leaving 90 million people without access to electricity. The country has the highest level of absolute energy poverty in the world and accounts for 12 percent of the global energy access deficit. This deficit has continued to grow over time, increasing by 7 million people over the past decade. Energy inequality also remains pervasive; 84 percent of urban areas have access to power, compared to 26 percent of rural ones. Likewise, the DRC has one of the lowest energy access rates in the world — just 20 percent of its population is projected to have access to modern energy by 2030. It is home to the third-largest population in the world without electricity access. A significant consumer disparity exists within the country, where just 1 percent of the rural population has access to modern energy, compared to 41 percent of the urban population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without significant intervention, Africa’s energy supply will not keep pace with the rising demand stemming from increasing urbanization, economic growth, and a rapidly growing population. Africa’s 1.4 billion population is forecasted to reach 2.5 billion by 2050, at which point the continent will be home to five of the eight most populous countries, with Nigeria surpassing the United States to become the third-largest country in the world. These countries will struggle to economically develop and reduce poverty without energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;insight-2-africa-is-an-energy-paradox--rich-in-energy-resources-but-the-most-energy-poor-continent-due-to-its-dependence-on-resource-exports&quot;&gt;Insight 2: Africa is an energy paradox — rich in energy resources but the most energy-poor continent due to its dependence on resource exports.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africa has significant reserves of minerals, oil, and gas. On the minerals front, Africa is home to over 80 percent of the world’s manganese, platinum, and chromium; roughly half of the world’s cobalt; and a fifth of the world’s graphite. These resources are critical for deploying renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles. However, these minerals are not being used for domestic consumption; instead, nearly all extracted minerals are exported for processing, manufacturing, and consumption elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the fossil fuels front, Nigeria, Angola, Libya, and Algeria feature among the top 20 producers of oil globally, leaving them vulnerable to falling oil demand. Overall, 10 out of 54 states on the continent are considered “fossil fuel dependent,” defined as having more than 60 percent of the value of merchandise exports come from the fossil fuel industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploration in sub-Saharan Africa has been productive. Estimates of oil and gas reserves have increased by over a factor of 10 since 1980. Africa was home to nearly 40 percent of global gas discoveries between 2010 and 2020. This includes discoveries in Mozambique, Tanzania, Egypt, Senegal, and South Africa. It now holds roughly 13 percent of the world’s natural gas reserves. Africa’s natural gas industry has significant untapped potential, with over 5,000 billion cubic meters of natural gas discovered but not yet approved for development. Still, fossil fuel efforts on the continent have accelerated in the past few years. In 2023, South Africa’s Ministry of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment gave French company TotalEnergies approval to drill offshore for oil and gas. TotalEnergies spent $300 million — or half of its global exploration budget — in Namibia in 2023, while the UK-based Shell has drilled four exploration wells along Namibia’s coast since 2021 — leading some to suggest that Namibia could become the world’s newest petrostate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ths majority of oil and gas investment in the region comes from international companies and is exported, thereby limiting domestic consumption. Africa exports 80 percent of its crude oil and 45 percent of its natural gas. For example, Mozambique has 100 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves — the third-largest natural gas reserves in Africa. In 2022, Mozambique sent its first shipment of liquefied natural gas to Europe, despite gas contributing just 1 percent of the country’s electricity supply. This is particularly troubling given just 40 percent of the country’s population has access to electricity. The focus on exports is largely because resource-rich African countries are seeking export revenue and firms want reliable offtake countries that are consistently willing to pay for oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;insight-3-weak-unreliable-and-aging-infrastructure-is-a-binding-constraint-to-improving-energy-access&quot;&gt;Insight 3: Weak, unreliable, and aging infrastructure is a binding constraint to improving energy access.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States have struggled to build the infrastructure required to strengthen energy security. For example, Nigeria’s energy sector has drastically deteriorated on the back of weak infrastructure. Between January 2010 and June 2022, there were 222 partial or complete grid collapses. These collapses are a product of grid instability owing to demand exceeding supply, volatile loads from industrial users such as steel mills, old infrastructure, and the unavailability of most transition lines. In the face of these challenges, Nigeria needs significant investment to maintain reliable power supply. The U.S. International Trade Administration estimates that it will cost up to $100 billion over the next two decades simply to maintain current service in Nigeria. The investment required to reach universal energy access would be exponentially more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa experiences similar challenges. The country is profoundly shaped by “load shedding,” or rolling power outages that occur to prevent overloading the national power grid when demand exceeds production. Load shedding has been increasing since 2007, with power outages ranging from 2 to 12 hours per day in duration. Load shedding is common: between January 1 and December 11, 2023, there were 332 days of load-shedding — over 99 percent of the time. National energy production is highly emissions-intensive and concentrated in coal — 85 percent, or about 42,000 megawatts (MW), is generated via coal-fired power stations, many of which are aging and poorly maintained. Eskom, a state-owned enterprise, produces 95 percent of South Africa’s electricity; its energy availability factor — or the proportion of time it could produce electricity — has consistently declined over the past 10 years, from 75 percent in fiscal year (FY) 2014 to 58 percent in FY 2023, and is expected to stay below 70 percent in the medium term. The power plants’ frequent breakdowns and maintenance problems are triggering widespread blackouts across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McKinsey estimates that $400 billion of investment will be required to increase electricity transmission and distribution in Africa by 2050. Decentralized renewable energy solutions, particularly standalone solar systems and mini-grids, have become more prevalent sources of electricity, especially in rural areas where grid expansion is commercially unviable. Africa was a recipient of 70 percent of the world’s off-grid investments between 2010 and 2020. Nigeria, which has the highest absolute number of people in energy poverty worldwide, was the largest recipient in sub-Saharan Africa of off-grid renewable energy aid during this period, facilitated by the Nigerian Energy Regulation Commission’s launch of the Regulation for Mini-Grids in 2017, which created a transparent regulatory framework for mini-grid developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;insight-4-high-levels-of-debt-have-left-countries-with-very-limited-public-finance-to-invest-in-energy-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Insight 4: High levels of debt have left countries with very limited public finance to invest in energy infrastructure.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt levels have drastically increased over the last decade; the average debt-to-GDP ratio in sub-Saharan Africa nearly doubled between 2013 and 2022, from 30 percent to 60 percent of GDP. Additionally, debt servicing costs have gone up, owing partially to the fact that 40 percent of the continent’s debt is denominated in foreign currencies, which means that currency fluctuations can drastically increase repayment costs. In 2023, debt servicing costs were estimated to reach 17 percent of government revenues — the highest in 24 years. This has drastically reduced the public finances available for improvements to the energy sector and other development priorities, including education and health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt challenges are exacerbated by volatile revenue streams for resource-dependent economies. For example, Angola is reliant on oil revenue and has struggled to repay debt — including $42 billion in Chinese loans that were extended after the civil war in 2002 using future petroleum revenues as a guarantee for repayment. This approach proved effective until the decline in oil prices. In 2016, as oil prices plummeted from $115 per barrel to below $50 per barrel, Angola entered a recession, with five straight years of economic decline. Angola narrowly averted debt default amid the compounding challenges of low oil prices and the Covid-19 pandemic. Consequently, Angola has inadequate public finance to invest in energy infrastructure. On average, 43 percent of Angola’s urban population and less than 10 percent of its rural population have access to energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mining sector has financed energy generation across the continent. However, most existing power generation has been directed and financed by mining companies to supply their own operations. For example, the third phase of the DRC’s Inga Dam project is expected to generate 4,400 MW — but most of this will be used to power the copper mines and smelters in Haut-Katanga Province. Just a third of the power would be allocated to power nearby Kinshasa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;insight-5-public-utilities-are-often-ill-equipped-to-meet-energy-needs&quot;&gt;Insight 5: Public utilities are often ill-equipped to meet energy needs.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 54 countries in Africa, 25 have public utilities that monopolize the electricity sector without any private sector participation. The other 29 allow private sector participation to some degree. Only 10 countries — less than a fifth of the continent — have unbundled utilities featuring an independent transmission system operator or a statutory unbundled transmission system. Given the large share of state-owned electricity companies, high levels of debt and limited fiscal capacity undermine the utilities’ ability to make public investments in energy infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Energy Agency has noted that “expanding and modernising Africa’s electricity infrastructure requires a radical improvement in the financial health of public utilities.” Staying solvent will require drastic reform to cost-of-electricity pricing to address the insolvency that continues to undermine gains in access and efficiency. Strengthening the financial health of these utilities also requires addressing financial mismanagement and corruption. In South Africa, infrastructure and coal supplies often face internal sabotage by individuals looking to contract repair work at inflated rates and theft by those looking to sell stolen parts. In 2023, the minister of finance exempted Eskom from “disclosing irregular spending in its audited annual financial statements” for a period of three years in an effort to build the company’s international credit rating. These reforms can improve not only the solvency of utilities but also the fiscal health of the country. In South Africa, Eskom has received $16 billion in bailouts since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Kenya, mismanagement has adversely affected its two utilities: Kenya Power, which the government has a majority share in, for distribution and Ketraco, which is wholly state owned, for transmission. Both have struggled with poor financial performance and rising debt levels. In Madagascar, JIRAMA, the state-owned electricity and water utility, has received significant fiscal subsidies to stay solvent. Still, it has been unable to adequately increase energy access. The International Monetary Fund has flagged that limiting fiscal transfers to the energy sector can improve the country’s overall fiscal position. In 2023, the World Bank stepped in to provide support to the government of Madagascar with a $400 million line of credit, which will support strengthening access to both energy and the internet. It is expected to increase energy access from 34 percent to 67 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;insight-6-the-investment-climate-has-disincentivized-private-capital-in-the-energy-sector&quot;&gt;Insight 6: The investment climate has disincentivized private capital in the energy sector.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sub-Saharan Africa is a difficult region for the private sector to work in. In 2020, it averaged a score of 51.8 (out of 100) on the World Bank’s Doing Business index, which assesses the extent to which a country’s regulatory environment is conducive to private sector operations. Sub-Saharan Africa ranks significantly below the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) high-income economy average of 78.4 and the global average of 63.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africa only received 2.4 percent of global renewable energy investment between 2010 and 2020 — of which three-fourths was concentrated in South Africa, Morocco, Egypt, and Kenya. Solar photovoltaic (PV) installations received $18 billion between 2010 and 2020, approximately a third of all renewable energy investment in the continent. Onshore wind projects received 31 percent of all investment, followed by solar thermal at 16 percent. The share of investment that went to solar technology increased from 2 percent in 2011 to 62 percent in 2012 and has stayed put in the 40–80 percent range, replacing bioenergy and small hydropower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is alignment between countries with low levels of energy access and limited ability to mobilize private capital and those that perform poorly on the Doing Business rankings. For example, the DRC has largely been unable to attract private capital given it has one of the most challenging business environments in Africa and globally. In 2020, the DRC ranked 183 out of 190 countries for the ease of doing business. It ranked in the bottom 10 percent of countries worldwide for enforcing contracts, paying taxes, trading across borders, and getting electricity. Current policies do not offer favorable investment conditions and remain ambiguous about issues such as ownership and concessions. Challenges with the creditworthiness of the offtaker utility, independent regulatory body, off-grid framework, high taxes, value-added taxes, and import duties have further disincentivized private capital mobilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africa’s energy crisis has become an impediment to doing business and mobilizing capital on the continent. As Table 1 shows, sub-Saharan Africa’s score for “getting electricity” — which the World Bank calculates by measuring the “procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly constructed warehouse,” as well as the “supply reliability, transparency of tariffs and the price of electricity” — is the lowest in the world at 50.4 (out of a possible 100). This is compared to 85.9 in OECD high-income countries, 75.1 in East Asia and the Pacific, and 71.7 in Latin America and the Caribbean. The cost of electricity in the region is 3,188 percent of income per capita — the highest of any region in the world and nearly 3.5 times as much as the next highest, South Asia; over five times higher than the East Asia and the Pacific region; and over seven times higher than Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa. Many African countries that are in need of private capital to improve electricity are in a negative cycle: expanding access to, and reducing the cost of, electricity is key for improving the investment climate — but improving the investment climate requires improving access to affordable and reliable electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-addressing-africas-energy-crisis&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADDRESSING AFRICA’S ENERGY CRISIS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-1-leverage-natural-gas&quot;&gt;Recommendation 1: Leverage natural gas.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite differences across states’ energy and climate plans, the African Union’s (AU) Energy Transition Program promotes a unified vision of energy development on the continent based on access to affordable and clean energy. The plan incorporates principles laid out by AU Agenda 2063, the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and the Paris Agreement on climate change. The Kigali Communique, developed by representatives from 10 states in 2022, lays out the requirements for a just and equitable energy transition in Africa and encourages international partners to align with its objectives. The communique highlights the importance of natural gas as a transition fuel in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modeling by the International Energy Agency shows that universal energy access in Africa hinges on using both renewable energy and natural gas. However, investment in renewable energy in the region has been insufficient. Africa has only received 2.4 percent of it between 2010 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is vital that universal energy access in Africa is achieved with the lowest emissions possible. Switching from coal to natural gas is an important mechanism for achieving both goals, given that gas emits roughly half the amount of carbon dioxide of coal when burned. The International Energy Agency has projected that leveraging Africa’s gas could result in an extra 90 billion cubic meters per year until 2030. With cooperation between governments and international companies, this gas can be used to both meet domestic demand and still be exported for revenue. The total carbon emissions from utilizing these gas resources over the next three decades is forecasted to be approximately 10 gigatons — which, when added to current emissions, would still amount to just 3.5 percent of the world’s emissions despite having a much larger share of the world’s population. Additionally, new technologies can further reduce the emissions generated from natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-2-invest-in-clean-energy-sources&quot;&gt;Recommendation 2: Invest in clean energy sources.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant financing is required to ensure African states have universal access to modern energy while concurrently meeting their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement. The International Energy Agency has stated that $200 billion per year in energy investment will be required to achieve this by 2030. This will require concessional financing; an estimated $28 billion is needed on an annual basis to mobilize $90 billion of private sector investment — 10 times as much as current financing. A concerted effort between governments, multilateral development banks, international donors, and the private sector is key to scale up clean energy investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many African countries are prioritizing renewable energy development and setting up programs to procure capital from the private sector. In 2011, South Africa developed the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program; since its inception, the program has procured 6.4 gigawatts from 112 independent power producers through seven bid windows — primarily in wind and solar. In August 2022, the Nigerian government launched the national Energy Transition Plan (ETP), which aims to have the country generate 30,000 MW of electricity from renewable energy sources and reach carbon neutrality by 2060. This process is estimated to create 340,000 jobs in the coming decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya boasts one of the most advanced power sectors in sub-Saharan Africa and has made significant strides in enhancing household access to electricity. As a result of both public and private investment, Kenya’s electricity generation capacity grew by an average of 4.9 percent per year between 2013 and 2022 — exceeding its 4.5 percent real GDP growth rate during the same time frame. In total, Kenya has experienced an electrification rate increase from 32 percent in 2013 to 75 percent in 2022. Although there is a disparity in energy access between rural and urban areas, it is smaller than most African nations, with urban energy access at 100 percent, contrasting with 65 percent in rural regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya serves as a success story of remarkable growth in renewable energy; about 90 percent of Kenya’s power comes from renewable energy, including geothermal, solar, and wind. The country shifted its baseload power from hydroelectric to geothermal, which has made the energy system more drought resistant — a critical feature given how drought-prone the Horn of Africa is. Kenya has been identified as one of the cheapest developers of geothermal power in the world. Although it currently has 863 MW of installed geothermal capacity, it has an estimated 10,000 MW geothermal energy potential. Still, Kenya is the world’s eighth largest geothermal producer and has the single biggest geothermal power plant. Kenya also has a growing solar industry, with large potential given how much direct solar radiation the country receives throughout the year. In 2021, it added 120 MW of solar power to the grid, bringing total solar capacity to 172 MW with more projects due to come online in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya also has a growing wind sector, which taps into its estimated 3,000 MW of wind power potential. The Lake Turkana Wind Power Station is the largest plant in Africa, generating 310 MW. The U.S. government, through the Development Finance Corporation, has also helped fund the Kipeto Wind Power Station, with turbines supplied by General Electric Energy. Kenya has also created a long-term vision to develop nuclear power, with power production expected to start in 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya’s success is a product of decades of private sector participation in the electricity sector through the independent power producer program it rolled out in the 1990s. The program gave 20-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) to private companies to supply Kenya Power, a partially state-owned enterprise. The PPA contract terms were investor-friendly but expensive for consumers and the government. There were two reasons for this. First, under the contracts, independent power producers were required to receive foreign-denominated payments regardless of whether the power was utilized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given currency fluctuations, energy costs were volatile and susceptible to exchange-rate adjustment fees on monthly electricity bills. Second, the contracts were linked to fuel prices — so electricity bills were also vulnerable to price hikes when fuel prices increased. However, instead of terminating these contracts and deterring future investment, the government opted to let the contracts expire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country continues to have a public-private model for energy generation. The government of Kenya has a 70 percent stake in the Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen), which contributes approximately two-thirds of the country’s installed capacity, while the remaining share is owned by independent power producers. The newer contracts for renewable energy — wind, solar and geothermal — have more consumer-friendly terms and have created more competitive pricing. Still, weaknesses exist with mismanagement of state-owned utilities, Ketraco and Kenya Power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-3-invest-in-grid-off-grid-and-mini-grid-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Recommendation 3: Invest in grid, off-grid, and mini-grid infrastructure.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the International Energy Agency’s Sustainable Development Scenario, three goals are concurrently reached: achieving the Paris Agreement’s commitment to keeping global warming below 2°C, reaching universal access to modern energy by 2030, and reducing energy-related air pollution and resulting illnesses and deaths. Grid, off-grid (also known as stand-alone), and mini-grid solutions have complementary roles to play in reaching these goals (Figure 3). Attaining universal energy access in sub-Saharan Africa will require building connections for 90 million people per year — a threefold increase from the current rate. Views vary on how this should be executed. Analysis by the International Energy Agency demonstrates that expanding national grids is the most economical approach for 45 percent of those getting energy access by 2030. On the other hand, in rural areas, mini-grids can offer two key benefits. First, they can provide access to communities that national grids currently cannot. Second, they can increase demand for electricity because the economic opportunities afforded by energy access coming from mini-grids can increase consumers’ ability to pay for electricity, incentivizing future grid expansion. The World Bank has estimated that bringing power to 380 million people in Africa will require spending $91 billion to build upward of 160,000 mini-grids. If mini-grid construction continues at its current pace, just 12,000 will be constructed by 2030 — less than 10 percent of projected demand — at a cost of $9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off-grid infrastructure is controversial. While it can offer quick access to affordable electricity where grid or mini-grid connections are not economically or technically viable, a large share of respondents in a 39,000-person survey conducted in 12 African countries reported that their off-grid electricity solution was insufficient for their power needs, including over 60 percent of Rwandans with off-grid systems. Off-grid systems can power some lighting or charge a phone using solar, wind, or hydropower, but it remains highly limited. Thus, while such solutions have an important role to play in the medium term, it will be important to invest in grid infrastructure given that rapidly growing populations will increase demand for higher-energy systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-4-deregulate-the-energy-sector&quot;&gt;Recommendation 4: Deregulate the energy sector.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy deregulation is critical to encouraging the private sector to invest. This, in turn, can create competition, improve quality of service delivery, and reduce costs. It can also increase generation capacity and reduce system power losses, which adversely impact both public and private enterprises and reduce economic growth. Some African countries have moved toward deregulation. In 2021, South African president Cyril Ramaphosa, acknowledging the limitations of the state-owned provider, Eskom, announced private investors would be allowed to generate up to 100 MW of electricity without requiring a license. Likewise, in June 2023, the government of Nigeria adopted the Electricity Act of 2023, which replaced the Electricity and Power Reform Act of 2005. The act introduced some key sector reforms, including including de-monopolozing the power sector by allowing states, firms, and households to generate, transmit, and distribute their electricity. As discussed earlier, Kenya’s success is a product of private sector participation in the electricity sector, alongside state-owned enterprises, since the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-5-undertake-necessary-legal-and-regulatory-reforms-to-help-mobilize-private-capital&quot;&gt;Recommendation 5: Undertake necessary legal and regulatory reforms to help mobilize private capital.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing and maintaining an effective enabling environment for public and private investment requires having a robust and transparent regulatory framework. As Power Africa points out, this should entail an autonomous and accountable regulatory institution with the explicit authority and capacity to carry out its responsibilities. Robust regulatory environments must define the responsibilities of public and private actors involved in the power sector to ensure accountability on both sides. This includes improving regulatory transparency around electricity tariffs and reducing investor risk by clarifying offtake agreements. Cost-of-service reforms to electricity pricing are also crucial; well-designed rate and tariff systems can ensure that public utilities are solvent and the private sector can operate profitably. These reforms can de-risk investments and help achieve public policy goals on both the emissions and energy access fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has expressed an ambition to play a larger role in the Arctic, citing its engagement as a “geopolitical necessity” amid increasing competition for resources and the emergence of new shipping lanes. After overtaking Russia as Europe’s biggest natural gas supplier, Norway has also encouraged energy companies to ramp up oil and gas exploration projects in remote Arctic regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This flurry of activity and interest has broad geopolitical implications as countries move to secure supply of critical resources and mitigate the risk of weaponized interdependence. Most notably, the Arctic is central to Russia’s vision of a multipolar global order, primarily achieved through the development of the Northern Sea Route and investments in Arctic military capabilities. China has also described the Arctic as a “new strategic frontier” and stated its ambition to become a “polar great power” by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this edition of Northern Connections, the authors examine two topics that may reshape energy security in the European Arctic. Both illustrate how the Arctic is being affected by a set of interacting global crises: climate change and Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first essay, Arild Moe from the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Oslo, Norway, outlines Russia’s emergence as a leading global exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) amid increasing Western pressure. He explains that despite European attempts to cut off Russian gas imports, Russian LNG exports to Europe have soared. However, while Russia has weathered these headwinds in the short term, the outlook for Russian LNG remains uncertain and highly contingent on external financing, access to emerging markets, and the implementation of Western sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second essay, Anne Husebekk, Silje Elde, and Else Kristine Welde from the Centre for the Ocean and the Arctic at UiT The Arctic University of Norway examine Norway’s opportunity to establish marine business parks and sustainably leverage Arctic oceanic resources. They find that “marine co-location can strengthen Norwegian sustainability and competitiveness” in a manner that could mitigate the climate crisis “while creating positive ripple effects” for Arctic coastal communities. However, the Norwegian regulatory environment for marine business parks is currently lacking, and there should be a clear legal framework that simplifies the procedures for obtaining permits and licenses and outlines the rules for impact assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-arctic-lng-exports-from-success-to-uncertainty&quot;&gt;Russian Arctic LNG Exports: From Success to Uncertainty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Arild Moe, Fridtjof Nansen Institute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s LNG development in the Arctic and subsequent exports have been a tremendous success story for the Kremlin. Despite domestic resistance from Gazprom, the state-owned Russian gas company, the output from the Yamal LNG project grew rapidly between 2017 and 2022 from 0.3 million tons to 21 million tons. Even the European Union’s ambition of becoming independent of Russian energy, as well as the gas trade disruptions since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have not hurt LNG exports to Europe. On the contrary, they have soared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia has weathered these headwinds so far, uncertainty looms in the future for the Russian LNG industry. U.S. and European leaders are increasingly paying attention. Although the Arctic LNG 2 project is targeting non-Western markets such as China and India, it has become the focus of recently introduced U.S. sanctions aiming to curtail further Russian LNG development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-russian-lng-breakthrough&quot;&gt;The Russian LNG Breakthrough&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the surge in U.S. shale gas production, Russia was the world’s largest producer and exporter of natural gas. Russia has vast gas resources and an extensive pipeline network that has connected gas fields in West Siberia with domestic consumers in western Russia and lucrative export markets in Europe. Gazprom, which held a monopoly on pipeline exports, thus had no need to prioritize LNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, one major LNG project was realized. The Sakhalin-2 offshore project in far eastern Russia was developed by a consortium between Dutch company Shell and Japanese partners operating under a production-sharing agreement from the mid-1990s. Although the consortium was forced to sell a majority stake to Gazprom in 2006, operationally and technologically the project continued to be dominated by the foreign partners. Gazprom also partnered with France’s Total (now TotalEnergies) and Norway’s Statoil (now Equinor) for the Shtokman field, a major gas development in the Barents Sea. But after several years of planning, the project was shelved in 2012 due to spiking costs and a deteriorated market outlook caused by the growing development of U.S. shale gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough for Russian LNG came from another quarter. Gas company Novatek was privately owned but had good contacts with the Kremlin through one of its main owners, Gennady Timchenko. In 2009, the company acquired control of licenses for gas fields destined for LNG on the eastern side of the Yamal Peninsula in West Siberia. It involved Total — and, since 2013, China National Petroleum Corporation — as a partner in what became the Yamal LNG project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, the plan was to use Gazprom as an agent for export sales, but financial backers demanded that the project have direct export access. This prompted Novatek to lobby for a legislative amendment allowing direct sales to foreign markets, making a serious dent in Gazprom’s export monopoly. After Western sanctions were imposed on Russian energy projects in 2014 in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and support to separatists in eastern Ukraine, China’s role in the Yamal LNG project increased, with the Silk Road Fund becoming a direct investor and a greater share of financing and equipment coming from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;an-arctic-lng-success-story&quot;&gt;An Arctic LNG Success Story&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the surprise of many observers, the Yamal LNG project was completed on time and on budget in December 2017 at a total cost of approximately $27 billion. Along with the liquefaction plant in the port of Sabetta on the Yamal Peninsula, 15 300-meter-long ice-breaking LNG carriers were custom-built at the Daewoo Shipbuilding &amp;amp; Marine Engineering (now known as Hanwha Ocean) yard in South Korea, to be owned and operated by international shipping consortia. The plant rapidly reached a nameplate capacity of 16.5 million metric tons per year from the first three production units, rising to 21 million tons in 2022 after adding an extra unit. The Russian government had been very supportive of the project, helping finance port infrastructure and providing tax concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of the project led to a reassessment of the role of LNG in Russia’s overall gas strategy. Even though Russian pipeline gas exports had been increasing every year, the outlook for further growth in sales to Europe, the most lucrative market, looked bleak because of stagnating demand. Pipeline exports to China were becoming important in volume terms but were not as profitable. LNG, by contrast, offered access to premium markets worldwide. The gas fields in the Arctic made it possible to direct exports both westward and eastward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, tensions with Gazprom increased since Yamal LNG sold gas not only in markets outside the reach of Russian gas pipelines, as initially promised, but also in Gazprom’s core markets in Europe. Moscow also exempted LNG from export and mineral extraction taxes as part of the incentives provided to develop the industry. According to Gazprom, this made competition with pipeline gas unfair, leading to unsuccessful attempts by the state-owned giant to restrict further liberalization of LNG exports. In fact, Novatek had secured licenses for several fields on the Gydan Peninsula — across the Ob Bay from Sabetta on the Yamal Peninsula — and prepared a series of LNG projects that would bring total output up to 70 million tons by 2030. With plans to expand further in the long term, these initiatives would cement the region as a major global source of LNG. The first of these projects, Arctic LNG 2, secured initial investments in fall 2019, with a Japanese consortium, Total, and two Chinese companies signing up as partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-lng-exports-in-the-shadow-of-war&quot;&gt;Russian LNG Exports in the Shadow of War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the Russian LNG strategy looked credible and sustainable, with Novatek as the lead actor and Gazprom also developing smaller LNG projects. Shortly after the start of the war, the European Union declared that it aimed to cut imports of Russian gas by two-thirds before the end of 2022. The European Union did not introduce sanctions against Russian gas per se, but several member countries ruled out new purchases of Russian pipeline gas. Moscow, however, saw cuts in exports to Europe as a tool to create economic disruption and coerce governments to limit their support for Ukraine and sanctions against the Kremlin. Russia used various means to curb pipeline exports, such as new payment arrangements and alleged pipeline repair needs — while maintaining that existing gas contracts were honored. Yet the explosions on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines under the Baltic Sea in September 2022 effectively took out a big chunk of the physical export capacity. As a result of these disruptions, Russian pipeline deliveries to EU countries were slashed by 80 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following these changes to the European energy market, LNG exports from Yamal soared. In fact, the lion’s share of output in 2022, some 15 million tons, was sold in Europe — contributing to the desperately needed diversification of gas supplies caused by the cuts in pipelines gas deliveries from Russia. The picture was the same in 2023. Due to the extraordinarily high gas prices in Europe in 2022 and 2023, the sellers of Russian LNG have enjoyed huge windfall profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This result has been a surprise to many observers and politicians since the European Union has a stated ambition of denying Russia income that could fuel the war and of ending Europe’s dependence on Russian gas supplies. Defenders of continued LNG imports argue that Russian LNG has been a relief in a difficult supply situation and has helped avert the European economic crisis that Putin had hoped for. Another argument is that less income from LNG exports ends up in Russian state coffers than from pipeline gas since LNG taxes are far less substantial. Besides, much of the Russian LNG sold belongs to foreign companies. Still, powerful voices within the European Union continue to call for curtailing imports of Russian LNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may also seem surprising to some that Russia has not stopped LNG exports to Europe, given that it wanted to destabilize European economies. There could be several reasons for this. Unlike the pipeline gas sold by Gazprom export arm Gazexport, which remains controlled by the state, LNG from Yamal is sold by the owners, including TotalEnergies, CNPC, Novatek, and other companies with long-term contracts for offtaking gas. They usually sell their gas through traders who deal with the importers. Moscow ordering a stop of gas sales from Yamal LNG to Europe would involve breaching chains of contractual arrangements and create a major commercial conflict with key partners in Russian LNG development. Not interrupting sales is also extremely important for the standing of Russian LNG globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;outlook-for-russian-lng&quot;&gt;Outlook for Russian LNG&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the European market for Russian pipeline gas disappearing and unlikely to recover even after the war in Ukraine is over, Russian hopes are now pinned on LNG. This includes the continuation of sales to Europe, which constitute only a fraction of the previous volume sold via pipeline, as well as new markets in other parts of the world such as South America and India. It has particularly high expectations regarding the LNG-hungry economies of Japan, South Korea, and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the outlook for Russian LNG does not only depend on Russia’s performance. Technology sanctions are hitting the sector, delaying implementation of Novatek’s bold expansion plans — even though Russian and Chinese replacement technology permitted the project to come onstream at the end of 2023. But further development also requires financing. Western investments are of course out of the question, and Chinese investors may find that the risk associated with new Russian hydrocarbon projects is too high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market access for Russian LNG is a major uncertainty. Although the United States had imported very little natural gas from Russia, Washington imposed an import ban on Russian gas shortly after the war in Ukraine broke out. New U.S. sanctions outlined in November 2023 leave current supplies from Yamal LNG untouched but do aim to stop companies worldwide from buying gas from Arctic LNG 2 (expected to start producing in early 2024), thus denying Russia new revenue streams. One expressed U.S. goal is to derail Russian plans for LNG expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementation of these sanctions, together with continued technology and financial restrictions, will undoubtedly have serious consequences for Russia’s LNG development. This holds true even if Russian owners succeed at selling more LNG to China and perhaps India. The longer-term outlook for Russian LNG will depend on the outcome of the war in Ukraine and domestic developments in Russia. As of now, the prospects for the reintegration of Russia into the global energy economy are highly uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;marine-business-parks-can-nature-and-industries-be-balanced-at-sea&quot;&gt;Marine Business Parks: Can Nature and Industries Be Balanced at Sea?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Anne Husebekk, Silje Elde, and Else Kristine Welde, Centre for the Ocean and the Arctic at UiT The Arctic University of Norway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fisheries, aquaculture, and offshore and subsea energy sources have long dominated popular conceptions of the use of the ocean in the Arctic. However, despite the vastness of the ocean and the significant long-term potential of both seafood and sea energy, it is the maritime areas close to coastlines that are most useful for the people living there. In these areas, activities compete for space. The Center for the Ocean and the Centre for the Ocean and the Arctic at UiT The Arctic University of Norway recently presented a policy brief to the Norwegian Minister of Fisheries and Ocean Policy, Cecilie Myrseth. The document provides specific recommendations on “how marine co-location can strengthen Norwegian sustainability and competitiveness” in a manner that mitigates the climate crisis “while creating positive ripple effects for nearby coastal communities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-marine-business-parks-are-significant&quot;&gt;Why Marine Business Parks Are Significant&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marine business parks are areas where at least two ocean activities are located together and benefit from each other. One example could be colocating offshore wind turbines providing renewable energy for land-based use and electric ships, carbon-capture projects for industrial storage and use, and seaweed, mussel, or oyster farming. Such a model would deliver cost savings for all stakeholders involved and reduce water pollution. Establishing marine business parks requires cooperation between several actors to plan the parks, harmonize regulations, collaborate with local governments, ensure businesses see the long-term benefits, and consult with external stakeholders. These external stakeholders could be local fishers who have knowledge in areas of specific interest for fisheries and can advise on where such parks could be established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-to-establish-marine-business-parks-in-norway-today&quot;&gt;How to Establish Marine Business Parks in Norway Today&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current Norwegian regulatory framework complicates the establishment of marine business parks because they span several industries, types of businesses, and policy areas across multiple municipalities. Therefore, they require harmonizing regulations covering these sectors and government entities. As explained in the policy brief, “A clear legal framework must be established that simplifies the procedures for obtaining permits, licenses and rules for impact assessments for marine business parks. At the same time, the environmental requirements for impact assessments and licenses must not be reduced, and the body dealing with this must possess considerable environmental expertise.” According to the center’s preliminary study on marine business parks, in Norway this legislation “must include both the licensing process (granting of permits), provisions regarding impact assessments, regulation of technical conditions (if a multipurpose platform is to be used), as well as provisions concerning health, safety, and environment (HSE). Furthermore, a tax and duties regime must be designed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Permanent marine business parks cannot be established until more research and innovation has taken place. In the long term, aspects such as pollution, the implications for the surrounding marine ecology, the influence of technological installations, and economic returns will vary depending on the specific environment and businesses involved with each park. This research and innovation should therefore analyze the topic through the lenses of biology, technology, economy, and social sciences in an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates stakeholders from coastal municipalities and the private sector, not just academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;future-sustainable-business-development-in-the-ocean&quot;&gt;Future Sustainable Business Development in the Ocean&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the severe ongoing climate and nature crisis affecting Arctic areas, the establishment of maritime businesses needs to be handled with care. There is a fine balance between conserving and exploiting the ocean and between traditional fishing and new businesses such as aquaculture, oil and gas exploitation, offshore wind power, and seabed mining. Policymakers and private sector stakeholders should pay attention to the global demand for food and energy, the health of the ocean, and the well-being of populations living on the coast before planning for the sustainable development of ocean businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, combining ocean businesses in multiuse parks could reduce the oceanic areas in use, develop relationships among private sector stakeholders, and free up resources to protect biodiversity. The sustainable use of ocean resources would contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals related to hunger, energy, climate, and oceans. However, no municipality, region, or nation can solve this problem by itself. If maritime business parks are shown to be the most sustainable way of organizing ocean businesses, then international regulations and cooperation will be required. In this context, several international projects are exploring multiuse parks in the ocean with an array of involved stakeholders and regulatory frameworks. Among them is UNITED, an EU- and industry-funded project that “aims to provide evidence of the viability of ocean multi-use through the development of five real-life ocean multi-use pilots that combine different marine activities.” This project is exploring the economic, environmental, societal, legal, and technological aspects of marine business parks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of ongoing activities, more research and investments are needed to ensure the long-term viability of marine business parks. The Norwegian government is uniquely positioned to finance such projects to explore their functionality, effects, economic profitability, and impact on the health of oceans and coastal populations. The Centre for the Ocean and the Arctic at UiT The Arctic University of Norway stands ready to advise the government throughout this process and provide a forum for dialogue on marine colocation issues in Norway.&lt;/p&gt;

This Analysis aims to provide a balanced assessment of the state of IS-K in the face of the Taliban’s efforts to crush it, but also other challenges it has been facing. The focus of this piece is to examine IS-K’s efforts to adapt to unfavourable developments and how it managed to preserve its core structure despite losses and setbacks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-ks-declining-activities&quot;&gt;IS-K’s declining activities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common metric of success and failure in counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency is the level of violent activities. On this basis, it could be argued that the Taliban were successful in handling the Islamic State in Khorasan (IS-K) threat. During 2023 IS-K attacks almost came to a halt. In April and May, there was not a single confirmed attack. From June to September, IS-K was only able to carry out one or two attacks per month, including gunfire attacks on Taliban patrols. From October, there was a modest resurgence, but even then, only four confirmed attacks took place in the month, including two involving explosives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is certainly a solid rationale for using the level of violent activities as a metric. A violent extremist organisation can ill afford to go quiet, especially after having launched its campaign and carried it out for years. Inevitably, inactivity will be perceived by members, prospective members, and sympathisers as a sign of decline or at least an organisation in trouble. Recruitment is likely to be affected and fundraising even more so. This may be especially true of an organisation like IS-K, which never raised much funding locally and has been dependent on funds coming from outside Afghanistan. Why would a “donor” want to fund an organisation which has fallen below the radar screen and whose fate looks uncertain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, in the case of the Taliban’s Emirate in Afghanistan as in the case of any other counter-terrorism effort, there is in reality no necessarily causal relationship between counter-terrorist operations and the level of activity of insurgents and terrorists. Any decline in the level of activity can be due to multiple causes. In the case of IS-K, sources within the organisation acknowledged during 2023 that Taliban raids against IS-K hideouts in the cities had taken a heavy toll. After indulging in rather indiscriminate repression in their first few months in power, the Taliban’s counter-terrorism effort has largely been intelligence-led throughout 2022 and 2023. This allowed them to be “surgical” in their strikes against IS-K, as they themselves say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-ks-funding-crisis&quot;&gt;IS-K’s funding crisis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same sources, however, also hinted at (at least) another, even more important factor behind the decline in their level of activity. Funding for IS-K started declining already in 2018, due to the downwards trajectory taken by their mother organisation - the Caliphate (IS Central). The drop in funds accrued from the central IS structure continued with some ups and downs through to 2023. As discussed in a forthcoming paper based on multiple local sources, at one point in early 2023 funding almost completely stopped accruing in the coffers of IS-K. Aside from the constantly declining resources that IS Central could allocate to its Khorasan branch, the crisis was compounded by a persistent crackdown by the Turkish authorities on all IS branches present on their territory, including IS-K. For years, the main financial hub of IS-K has been in Turkey, where, thanks to the growing Afghan community, informal banking connections were becoming common. Turkey was also a major financial hub for IS Central, thus making the transfer of funds between the two very easy. As detailed in a previous report, the Turkish crackdown led to tens of IS-K members being detained, and seriously disrupted their operations. The Taliban contributed to compounding IS-Ks’ financial crisis by increasing their monitoring of financial flows and warning hawala traders in Afghanistan of the consequences of getting caught transferring IS-K cash. In the first half of 2023, IS-K ended up not even being able to pay salaries and logistics to its men on the ground in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K gradually managed to cope to some extent with the Turkish crackdown, relocating financial operations to alternative locations, and sought to diversify its sources of revenue away from the struggling IS Central, with limited success. Sources in the informal banking sector, contacted by the author’s research team in August 2023 and again in January 2024, indicated that tightened Taliban monitoring of informal banking was in part neutralised by avoiding the transfer of big sums and relying instead on multiple transfers of small amounts, which could be disguised as remittances. As a result, a complete financial choke off was averted, even if funding remained at low levels even compared to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the deep financial crisis of 2023, IS-K leadership did not lay idly, waiting for financial flows to be restored. Internal sources explain that IS-K continued restructuring organisationally and transitioned towards a fully underground system, under the assumption that it will not be able to control significant chunks of territory for the foreseeable future. Mobile bases and training camps and small cells have now become the norm throughout IS-K’s structure in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-prospects-of-is-k-resurgence&quot;&gt;The prospects of IS-K resurgence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce the negative effects of its very low level of activities in the field, IS-K expanded its online propaganda and recruitment activities. Although at the peak of its financial crisis in the first half of 2023 the propaganda activities declined, overall IS-K was able to give the impression of a proactive and resilient organisation and to magnify the significance of its few and intermittent attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Propaganda alone, of course, will not rescue IS-K. In the longer term, the potential for an IS-K resurgence will depend on a series of developments and their interplay including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;whether the 2022/2023 alignment of negative circumstances affecting funding (the decline of IS-Central, the Turkish, and Taliban crackdowns on their finances) dissolves or is somehow bypassed;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;whether IS-K can avoid or contain organisational decay while it struggles financially and is able to carry out only a negligible level of military activities;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;whether the relative unity of the Taliban in facing IS-K is superseded by growing Taliban infighting;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;whether the Taliban fails to address weak spots in their counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency campaigns; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;whether new opportunities for fundraising and recruitment arise out of developments over which IS-K has little control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, IS-K managed to re-establish some financial flows in the latter part of 2023. These will not suffice for a full re-launch of IS-K and the organisation will have to figure out how and where to raise more. IS-K was proactive in trying to prevent organisational decay. It is hard to assess how successful that was, although internal sources acknowledge some decline in membership numbers between the second half of 2022 and the second half of 2023. While the Taliban continue to suffer from internal divisions, as of the end 2023, there had not been any major split that could set IS-K on an altogether different trajectory. It is worth noting, however, that tension between the leadership and the Tajik Taliban of the north-east was growing fast in late 2023 and early 2024. Taliban sources, contacted by the author’s research team in October 2023, reported cases of Tajik Taliban members being detained on allegations of having links to IS-K, which at least partially confirms IS-K might just be starting to make some inroads there. Disgruntled Tajik Taliban, therefore, could offer some opportunity for the terrorist group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limitations-of-the-talibans-counter-terrorism&quot;&gt;Limitations of the Taliban’s counter-terrorism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K can also be reasonably confident that the Taliban’s counter-terrorism effort will remain focused on repression, however “surgical”, and on financial interdiction. Even here, one can see some cracks in the Taliban’s approach: checks on the informal banking sector remain superficial, as the Taliban seemingly do not want to disrupt the sector, which is vital to the Afghan economy and possibly to the Taliban themselves. More importantly, despite successful experiments in Nangarhar province, the Taliban seem to have no intention of pursuing local reconciliation deals with communities connected to IS-K, nor of offering the Salafi community, which has been a major source of support for IS-K, some kind of integration into the Emirate’s structure, even at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another weak spot of the Taliban’s counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency is that it is poorly resourced. Although the Taliban keep adding manpower to both army and police, they lack advanced equipment. While they are not strong believers in technology, the Taliban believe that they would certainly benefit from some more airlift capabilities and from drones, especially for mountain operations. They might make progress in this direction in the not-so-distant future, as the Emirate by the end of 2023 looked close to obtaining China’s diplomatic recognition, which might be followed by some other countries in the region and would considerably improve the Taliban’s chances of obtaining some military supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-potential-recruitment-pool-of-foreign-jihadists-in-afghanistan&quot;&gt;The potential recruitment pool of foreign jihadists in Afghanistan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short term, perhaps IS-K’s brightest chances of resurgence are linked to the Taliban’s troubled attempts to bring under control the variety of jihadist groups which they host and that once supported their jihad. To safeguard their relations with neighbouring countries, the Taliban need to restrain these groups, but as much as possible without alienating them. In fact, some have already been alienated. The Yuldash faction of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) had remained loyal to the Taliban after IS-K appeared in 2014 – 2015, but after the Taliban takeover, they were sufficiently upset by the restrictions the Emirate was imposing on them that they started defecting to IS-K. Few of them are now left under the Taliban’s “protection”. The same applies to the Uyghurs of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), who were the first to be relocated away from their long-term hideout of Badakhshan, in the north-east of Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there are only hundreds of Uzbeks and Uyghurs in Afghanistan, defections to IS-K can only have a limited impact. The Taliban’s biggest problem is however the Tehrik Taliban Pakistan (TTP), whose military power is not comparable with that of any other foreign jihadist group. While numbers fluctuate due to operations in Pakistan, the TTP has on average some thousands of fighters on Afghan territory and what is worse from the Taliban Emirate’s point of view, it has been recruiting growing numbers of Afghans within its ranks. The Taliban’s Emir and his loyalists are trying to improve relations with Pakistan and have issued a decree banning the participation of Afghans in the TTP’s fight against Pakistan. A previous decree banned foreign jihadists from using Afghanistan as a base for attacks to other countries. Efforts to implement these decrees have been made as the Taliban intelligence has detained TTP members who were returning from raids in Pakistan. In practice, however, the Emirate is not able to restrain the TTP effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pakistans-ttp-the-potential-ally-that-could-turn-the-tide&quot;&gt;Pakistan’s TTP: the potential ally that could turn the tide?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Taliban and TTP sources say that in the meetings between the two the issue of TTP defections to IS-K is constantly discussed. TTP leaders claim that if they were to give up jihad in Pakistan, they would face massive defections to IS-K, implying that they paradoxically agree with the Pakistani authorities that without an Afghan safe haven the jihad would not be sustainable. They even hint subtly at the fact that the TTP leadership itself might have to ally with the Islamic State at that point. Such threats must be made to appear more plausible in the Taliban’s eyes by the fact that, according to both TTP and IS-K sources, the two groups have been cooperating in Pakistan. First, they reportedly agreed on their respective “taxation” rights and recruitment areas in different parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and also to exchange logistics. Even inside Afghanistan, areas of TTP control partially overlap with areas of IS-K activity and it is clear that the TTP tolerates IS-K presence there, without supporting the Taliban’s counter-terrorism effort at all. IS-K had from its start a strong presence of former TTP members in its ranks and some TTP factions, chiefly the hardline Jamaat ul-Ahrar, were once closely allied with the TTP. Despite breaking that alliance and re-joining the TTP in 2020, Jamaat ul Ahrar’s leaders and cadres are still often reported by local sources in Kunar (as they repeated multiple times to the author’s research team throughout 2023) to meet the latter’s cadres and leaders, where IS-K has a significant presence on the ground. Furthermore, Jamaat ul-Ahrar approved the February 2023 attack on a mosque in Peshawar, which the TTP condemned and IS-K approved of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emirate never asked the TTP to give up its jihad, but it did ask them not to use Afghanistan as a base for its raids into Pakistan. It tried to mediate between TTP and Islamabad in 2022, however the mediations were unsuccessful. During 2022 and 2023, on several occasions the Taliban have asked the TTP to move its fighting units into Pakistan, according to both Taliban and TTP sources, contacted by the author’s research team on several occasions throughout 2022-23. The TTP tried to comply to some extent and started keeping larger numbers of fighters inside Pakistan. That fell short of what the Taliban’s Amir was asking for and as pressure from Kandahar grew, TTP leaders have at times grown defiant. A case in point is the Chitral raid of September 2023, which the TTP clearly carried out from Afghanistan and even saw a significant participation of Afghan volunteers in the TTP’s ranks. It looked like a provocation of the TTP leadership, tired of being put under pressure by the Taliban to do more to comply with their injunctions. It was after the raid that for the first time the Taliban cracked down on TTP seriously and detained tens of those returning from Chitral. After top level meetings and negotiations, the majority if not all of the detainees, were released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that there are undoubtedly many Taliban members who sympathise with the TTP’s cause. They despise the Pakistani government and believe that the TTP deserves to be supported in its jihad against Islamabad, having contributed many lives to the Taliban’s own jihad inside Afghanistan. These TTP sympathisers are likely the majority of the Taliban in the east and south-east, where the TTP has in the past operated and therefore, solidarity links are stronger. As a result, thoroughly enforcing a ban on TTP activities from Afghan territory would also worsen intra-Taliban relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Taliban, taking this course of action would be very risky, and they know it. However, they are also under very heavy pressure from Pakistan to do something about it. Eventually in November 2023, the Pakistani authorities started expelling hundreds of thousands of illegal Afghan residents, putting the economy of the Emirate under additional strain. The Pakistani armed forces also carried out occasional artillery and air strikes on Afghan territory, as well as targeted assassinations of TTP commanders. As a result of this and of additional pressure that Pakistan might bring to bear in the future, the Emirate might eventually be forced to take measures that the TTP will resist. For example, there is talk of the Emirate seeking Pakistani funding to relocate TTP members and their families to northern Afghanistan, a solution already tested unsuccessfully in 2023 that will certainly not be welcomed by the TTP’s leaders. Other measures that the Taliban might take could instead be at least divisive for the TTP, such as for example the rumoured plan to renew Taliban mediation between TTP and Islamabad. Hardline TTP factions, such as Jamaat ul Ahrar, would strongly object to it. Already, distrust between the Taliban and TTP runs high. Within TTP ranks many who suspect that the targeted assassinations of TTP members are orchestrated by Pakistani intelligence with the help of elements of the Taliban. The prospect of TTP following the path of many former IMU and ETIM jihadists into joining or allying with IS-K cannot therefore be discounted. This is likely to be IS-K’s best chance of raising its head again in eastern Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ultimately, nuclear-armed countries will be cautious in their use of force in any competition, which means that power does not come from the barrel of a gun, no matter how technologically advanced that gun may be, but from the persuasiveness of a nation’s ideas.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition with the West shapes modern China. The story of this competition begins with China’s last great emperor, the Qianlong emperor (who abdicated in 1796), after rejecting commercial ties with an emerging Great Britain, saying Britain had nothing China needed. It was 153 years before China had another leader strong enough to engage confidently with foreign nations. Mao Zedong reforged China into a single, powerful state, but his ideology ultimately impoverished it. When his successor Deng Xiaoping took power, he found a China that was weak and backward. Deng was determined to remedy this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ambivalent relationship with the West is built on a long tradition that dates back to Qianlong and the shock of defeat in the Opium Wars. China began to modernize and “Westernize” its economy in the nineteenth century. So did Japan, but while Japan succeeded, China did not make progress until Deng. Deng’s solution was to open China to the West to stimulate its indigenous technology base and commercial capabilities. This was not yet a competition, but the West — particularly the United States — was and is the yardstick by which China measures its progress, comparing the number of PhDs or patents issued and, above all, the size of national incomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s opening came at a favorable time in U.S. foreign policy. Still recovering from defeat in Southeast Asia, the United States, under President Jimmy Carter and his national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, saw China as a counterbalance to an assertive and powerful Soviet Union. They began to selectively strengthen Chinese military capabilities, selling, among other things, advanced torpedoes, laser-guided artillery shells, and Black Hawk helicopters, while permitting increased commercial ties. The transfer of military technology ended abruptly with the Tiananmen Square massacre, but commercial ties continued to expand and created a giant and deeply interconnected technology base. Some Americans, seeing China’s rise, even hoped China would become a responsible partner that the United States could guide, much as Great Britain had envisioned itself guiding an emerging United States a century earlier. But competition, not partnership, best describes the U.S.-China relationship today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically (since it was ultimately infeasible), Ronald Reagan’s “Star Wars” Strategic Defense Program frightened China into thinking it would fall behind in technology and never catch up unless it made enormous investments in research and used any means to acquire technology from the West. There is an illicit aspect to China’s growth, given its massive espionage campaigns, its use of intellectual property (IP) theft (something that predates the 1949 revolution), and its predatory commercial practices. China does not respect rules for trade and IP protections. Optimistic Westerners hoped this would change as China matured and adopted global norms of commerce, but China felt that espionage and IP theft were justified by the “century of humiliation” inflicted by European imperialism and by the need to grow to ensure this never happened again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are precedents for this competition. The Kitchen Debate between Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev and then vice president Richard Nixon in 1959 was not over who had the best technology or which country made the best toaster; it was over which economic model — markets or Marxism — performed best for citizens. If the debate were held today, the likely winner would be the European Union, whose citizens receive better services than those provided by either the United States or China. But the strategic focus is on economic growth and innovation, not welfare, and the United States and China see themselves engaged in an intense technological contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1960s space race is another precedent. Americans panicked when the tiny Sputnik appeared overhead in 1957. The “Sputnik moment” led to massive U.S. investments in science. The Kennedy administration followed this by setting the goal of reaching the Moon first. The benefits of international influence and the military implications of a lunar landing were clear. The immense spending to get to the Moon, combined with the scientific and technical investments made in response to Sputnik, laid the foundations for the U.S. high-tech economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States had no Sputnik moment with China; in fact, until recently, it had the reverse. In the early 1990s, the United States cut government investments in science and research built up over the Cold War as no longer necessary. For 25 years after the Cold War’s end, the United States coasted, comfortable in its supremacy. It did not regard China as a competitor, even as China embraced competition. China’s rise and the assertive policies of President Xi Jinping have shaken U.S. confidence and ignited competition in many ways centered on technological leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything, Xi was premature in proclaiming China’s inevitable rise, as this prompted the United States to reinvest in science and restrict technology transfers to China. China still has one great advantage in the new contest compared to the Soviets. Its deep interconnection with Western economies means it can participate in global markets to sell, buy, and seek financing in ways the Soviets never could. These market connections mean the competition with China is not a replay of the Cold War, where bifurcation between East and West meant there was little exchange of capital or ideas, and Cold War policies, like export controls, will not work as well in this profoundly interconnected environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terms of competition are muddled by analytical shortcomings. There is a tendency among Western analysts to explain complex economic phenomena in terms of a single technology. But a single technology, whether chips or artificial intelligence (AI), does not determine the course of complex and intricately interconnected economies. Just as with the Kitchen Debate or the space race, this is competition between economic models and the political system behind them, not a tech arms race. This competition of models will determine whether China or the United States will be more powerful as a result of the economic growth and technological advances innovation creates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this new competition, the United States has many advantages, but it faces a major obstacle. In China, the Chinese Community Party’s desire for control, Xi’s affirmation of Marxism, and the accompanying recentralization of economic activity will inevitably slow China’s growth and its ability to innovate, as will a growing global reaction to China’s predatory practices. Disarray in Washington does not bode well for U.S. competitiveness, but even a relative U.S. decline does not mean China’s rise. There is more to power than being seen as ahead in technology, and China lacks compelling ideas for global leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But political disarray undercuts U.S. strength. Technology leadership is just one of the global competitions facing the United States: there is one with China, another with emerging, powerful economies that reject the old U.S.-led global order, and one with dogmas on both left and right that undercut the ideas that create the political climate where innovation can flourish. U.S. politics is going through another chapter of the partisan disputes that make Congress dysfunctional, threatening the culture of innovation and science that underpins U.S. strength. American success in a battle of ideas is not guaranteed, and massive defense budgets do not compensate for this. Ultimately, nuclear-armed countries will be cautious in their use of force in any competition, which means that power does not come from the barrel of a gun, no matter how technologically advanced that gun may be, but from the persuasiveness of a nation’s ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A profound shift in trade, technology, and security policy is underway. This has resulted in an increasingly technology-driven economic security policy that has reshaped strategic competition and infused geopolitical risk into commercial considerations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globalization is changing in profound ways. Bilateral trade and investment between the United States and China declined over 15 percent in 2023, down significantly from record highs the previous year. The International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, forecasts slowed trade growth in 2024. The U.S. economic outlook is poised for a soft landing, but major partner economies, such as Germany, are now definitionally in recession. Geopolitical currents — once a background rhythm of the globalized economy — have moved to the forefront of trade and economic relationships. The concurrent three Cs — Covid-19 fallout, tensions with China, and mounting climate change pressure — have led countries and companies alike to reassess the resiliency and vulnerability of their supply chains. The proliferation of advanced technology promises further disruptions to trade as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2022, the United States levied relatively broad export controls on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, signaling a move away from an end user–based system of export controls that had characterized an era of economic détente in the 1990s toward a new era of technology-driven national security. In restraining chip flows to China, the United States moved semiconductors to the forefront of trade policy, securing buy-in from Japan and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is also considering screening outbound investment. In August 2023, the White House published an executive order directing the Department of Treasury to stand up an outbound investment screening system that functions as a notification regime. This regime will provide greater clarity on the volume and nature of U.S. capital and knowledge flows to China in AI, quantum technology, and semiconductors that could be used in military contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concurrent with an expanded national security trade tool kit, the United States and its close partners have sought to build more secure supply chains, particularly throughout the semiconductor sector. Building secure semiconductor supply chains presents considerable challenges. First, export control parity is critical for deeper cooperation since export controls function as a prerequisite to scaling up production. In short, in jurisdictions where the United States believes the risk of technology leakage to China is significant, the United States will not increase investments in sensitive technologies. Second, the United States and its partners must work together to offset some of the costs associated with expanded export controls. For now, the administration maintains the security benefits outweigh the associated economic costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign technology producers such as the Netherlands have signaled a willingness — if not enthusiasm — to engage with the United States on export controls. Peter Wennink, outgoing CEO of Dutch chip champion ASML, has said that additional restrictions on exports to China will not significantly harm the company since it can find alternative buyers and maintain a sizable backlog. However, finding a country with a developed tech sector, a highly skilled workforce, and sufficiently strict trade controls could prove challenging. The U.S.-Japan bilateral efforts to accelerate two-nanometer chip production in a Rapidus-IBM joint effort underscores the alignment of several enabling factors, which include similar export control rules, a highly skilled labor force, and a stable business environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional trade policy would typically assist in offsetting some of these costs by codifying trade facilitation measures and making the exchange of goods and services more efficient. However, the era of traditional trade has been supplanted by an era of “weaponized interdependence” and economic security, and this environment is unlikely to change in the short to medium term. Together with allies, the United States should work to craft rules for this new form of globalized interdependence in which supply chain security will increasingly drive economic policy. New rules must focus on export control and investment screening cooperation but must go a step further in institutionalizing cost offset mechanisms like the U.S.-Japan deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the international level, these new rules could emanate from a new architecture that evolves out of an expanded G7 with a secretariat. An expanded G7 could include Australia and the Republic of Korea. This would grow the economic might of the bloc while identifying opportunities to follow through on building more resilient supply chains. This new architecture could also create clearer guidelines for the rules of engagement at the supply chain and national security nexus, which no other economic institution is currently capable of managing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the domestic level, the United States must ensure the effectiveness of its economic statecraft tools. The United States and its partners continue to move toward an environment dominated by geoeconomics, and economic weapons have reemerged as a prominent feature of the U.S. strategic tool kit. However, unlike the use of kinetic warfare, for which there are clearly established guidelines — a targeting doctrine, a firehose policy, and collateral damage minimization efforts — the U.S. government lacks those tools for economic warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A profound shift in trade, technology, and security policy is underway. This has resulted in an increasingly technology-driven economic security policy that has reshaped strategic competition and infused geopolitical risk into commercial considerations. This has manifested in expanded use of trade and investment controls alongside concurrent efforts to retool supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better weather these systems-level changes, the United States and its partners must continue to deepen cooperation on export controls. Yet, controls are insufficient in bolstering security in the long run. As partners pursue industrial policies related to advanced technologies, identifying policy goals at the outset and working toward transparency in implementation will be critical. The United States and its allies have made tremendous progress in advancing a new agenda, and it now falls on partners to follow through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Getting trade policy right has always been complicated. . . . It appears the United States is once again at an inflection point where a growing number of experts are calling for major change.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post–Cold War world order is over, and a new era of geoeconomic and tech competition is underway. Leveraging trade tools to assure the nation’s competitiveness on the global stage will be critical to U.S. foreign policy in the twenty-first century. In tandem with renewed competition, populism is now a defining feature of political landscapes at home and abroad. This shift has yielded efforts to formulate an equitable, worker-centered trade agenda. Policymakers will need to carefully balance today’s new geopolitical reality with domestic pressures to further prosperity and assure security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting trade policy right has always been complicated. Macroeconomically, trade is a win-win situation: it produces more jobs and growth for all parties to an agreement. Microeconomically, however, trade produces winners and losers as some thrive in a more competitive environment and others flounder. The latter blame their problems on imports, and sometimes they are right. Trade creates gains but it does not always distribute them — that depends on tax and education policies, among others. Despite international trading rules against a wide range of unfair practices like dumping and subsidization, some countries cheat, and even when they are caught, relief is often too little, too late. More often, however, the real culprit is technological change and productivity improvement that domestic industry has trouble matching. Sorting out the actual problems and devising a policy of effective solutions has proved difficult and, in the past, led to significant policy debates. It appears the United States is once again at an inflection point where a growing number of experts are calling for major change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, U.S. trade policy since World War II has had two pillars: promote free trade and improved market access and create and maintain rules and structures that support an open rules-based trading system. That policy has produced enormous benefits for U.S. exporters in various sectors. U.S. exports of manufactured goods reached nearly $1.4 trillion in 2019, and exports of services reached nearly $850 billion that year. About 25 percent of U.S. farm products by value are exported each year. However, recently, U.S. trade policy has led to complaints that benefits have accrued primarily to large companies and their executives, not to workers. The complaints have, in turn, led to calls for a “trade policy for workers” or a “trade policy for the middle class.” As with many new ideas, exactly what those terms mean remains to be fleshed out. At this juncture, they appear to mean enforcing existing rules rather than creating new ones, reallocating benefits away from corporations toward workers, bringing manufacturing back to the United States, avoiding market access concessions, and pursuing a variety of inclusivity and sustainability goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing this more idealistic policy faces three challenges. First, it will encounter resistance from trading partners still comfortable with a more traditional approach that focuses on tangible benefits: increasing market access, reducing trade barriers, and refining the rules. Second, world events — notably the Russian invasion of Ukraine and an increasingly aggressive China in the Indo-Pacific — have conflated national security considerations with trade policy. Finally, shortages caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, coupled with security concerns, have refocused policy attention on supply chain resilience rather than on production efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constructing a coherent policy that addresses those challenges has been made more complicated as some developing countries and authoritarian states push alternative narratives that challenge current rules and institutions and exacerbate the divide between developed and developing nations. Reconciling these differences may be impossible in the short term, but if the United States is to maintain its position of global leadership and grow its economy, it needs to try. With 95 percent of the world’s consumers outside U.S. borders, promoting trade is essential for future growth. Trade’s ability to lower costs and increase efficiency is also essential to meeting other global challenges like climate change. The following suggestions may help move policy forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should recognize that while the old Washington Consensus on free market economics is fading, a new consensus has yet to develop, and not all countries are ready for a more idealistic approach. Trade negotiations remain grounded in the search for tangible benefits. Countries are interested in what is in it for them, and the United States is no exception. A successful policy is one that provides opportunities for mutual gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States can make progress on its inclusivity and sustainability goals only if it is prepared to accommodate the goals of other countries, primarily developing ones, which will require rethinking on the part of current stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Companies must recognize that in a more transparent world increasingly sensitive to long-standing inequities, trade policy should include support for worker rights, human rights, environmental sustainability, and other social goals. Governments will require more attention to these issues, and consumers will demand it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trade skeptics must recognize that trade is a two-way street and that accomplishing their goals will require U.S. market access concessions. Moreover, they must acknowledge that trade is as much about exports and economic gains as it is about imports and potential losses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other countries must recognize that increased access to developed country markets in Europe and the United States is not a right but an opportunity that requires reciprocal concessions on their part. There is no free lunch — for them or for us.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best approach is to work within a rules-based framework that imposes discipline on miscreants. The United States has long been a strong supporter of the World Trade Organization and should continue to support the institution, its rules, and its dispute settlement process. At the same time, centrifugal forces in the trading system are making multilateral agreements much more difficult to reach. The United States should not give up on multilateralism but should also pursue plurilateral and bilateral agreements with countries willing to make more ambitious commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While trade accelerates economic change, policy change comes more slowly as nations cling to past practices and resist politically risky innovations. The most successful policy will avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good and will attempt to accommodate other nations’ political and economic imperatives while simultaneously pushing them forward on ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The future competitiveness and security of the United States depends on doubling down on a strategy that supports a strong domestic innovation system that is also internationally connected and resilient.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world runs on semiconductors. They underpin every aspect of modern life, mediating the way people work, consume, and communicate. Banking, transportation, and other public platforms run on computers. And with advances in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies, semiconductors will become significantly more pervasive. Leadership in semiconductor technology is, therefore, essential for the United States to maintain its prosperity, competitiveness, and national security. Securing this leadership, in turn, depends on staying on top of three major dynamics — technological, logistical, and geopolitical — driving change in semiconductor technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moore’s law, which in its most general statement anticipates that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years, drives the first dynamic. Firms in the semiconductor and other advanced technology industries expect the speed and capabilities of chips to not only keep increasing but also to do so at an ever-lower cost. With all the advances gained since the late 1960s expected to double over the next two years and then double again two years later, the pace of change is now rapidly accelerating. New computing capabilities will open new technological possibilities, many of which will disrupt existing social, commercial, and political networks. In turn, business leaders, policymakers, and civic entrepreneurs will have to craft new institutions to govern these new shared commons while also allowing innovation to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, as researchers approach the limits of subatomic physics in their quest to cram more transistors into a microchip, the end of the classical definition of Moore’s law might be near. Even so, the growth of capabilities and drop in the cost of semiconductors are expected to continue, driven by innovations in chip design and in the assembly and packaging of semiconductor devices. These innovations will continue to drive economic growth and productivity across the swath of industries that make and use advanced technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to address vulnerabilities in the globally integrated networks of chip research, production, and distribution drives the second dynamic in semiconductor technology. The relatively mild disruption in chip production during the Covid-19 pandemic created multiple downstream ripple effects, halting some auto production, which relies on critical electronic components, and, in turn, affecting inputs to construction and other industries. This was a wake-up call to how critical a secure supply of semiconductors is to the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of further strategic concern is the geographic concentration of chip production in East Asia. Taiwan manufactures some 90 percent of the world’s advanced semiconductor chips. More generally, 75 percent of semiconductor production now takes place in East Asia. Conflict or even a major earthquake in the region could severely disrupt the world’s semiconductor supply, inflicting severe damage to economies across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The semiconductor industry is now in the process of rewiring itself to be less susceptible to single points of failure and other weaknesses in the value chain. In support, the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act in the United States and comparable policies in Europe and Japan seek to strengthen domestic production and create more resilient global research, production, packaging, and distribution networks. This adaptation is taking place even as demand for semiconductors is expected to soar. The global semiconductor industry, already massive, could grow by 80 percent within a decade to exceed $1 trillion, according to analysis by McKinsey. For the United States to remain a leader in this industry, a substantial and sustained buildup of the physical, research, financial, and skills infrastructure will be required, as well as creative collaborations with both traditional allies and new strategic partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is the final dynamic driving change in the semiconductor industry. China was a deeply connected part of the global semiconductor network that grew over the past several decades of relative geopolitical calm. While China has now emerged as a commercial and geopolitical rival, major elements of that integration remain in place, with a significant portion of second- and third-tier suppliers for the semiconductor industry still found in China today. China also remains a major market for semiconductors, accounting for about a third of worldwide final sales. This mutual dependency does not allow for rapid decoupling. Instead, new investments — driven by rising global demand for semiconductors and supported by national policies and alliances — will in time shape the evolution of semiconductor networks that are more resilient to Chinese actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the United States is limited in how it can deny or delay China’s ability to acquire or develop advanced semiconductor technologies. Recent restrictions on advanced chip making equipment have affected some Chinese capabilities. But these actions have also intensified China’s efforts to boost domestic innovation while reducing imports from U.S. firms. Such reductions have cut the revenues of U.S. firms and hence their ability to invest in the next generation of technology. Their Chinese counterparts, by contrast, do not depend on market forces to survive. Indeed, the Chinese national and regional governments are already providing large subsidies to encourage domestic firms to pivot toward innovation and production in higher-node chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The convergence of these three dynamics — Moore’s law and beyond, ongoing adaption to improve resiliency, and the new chip war with China — finds the global semiconductor industry on which the world’s economy turns at a perilous moment. The future competitiveness and security of the United States depends on doubling down on a strategy that supports a strong domestic innovation system that is also internationally connected and resilient. In this light, the CHIPS and Science Act must be seen as an initial down payment on a strategic long game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China is at the heart of a key challenge for the United States in the energy transition. Faster deployment of renewable energy based on Chinese technology could cede long-term advantages to a key geopolitical competitor.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, how will the actions of the United States and China affect the global energy future? The debate in Washington has been to what extent the two countries should seek to accomplish shared goals through cooperation or competition. Yet an approach that moves beyond cooperation or competition and combines both coherently could help achieve a more secure and cleaner energy future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individually, the two countries have complementary strengths and routes to global influence. After the shale revolution, the United States became an energy powerhouse. The country produces more oil and gas than ever before and has become a significant exporter of crude oil, petroleum products, and liquified natural gas. With bountiful resources, the United States has secure energy supplies and falling domestic emissions, much of it from replacing coal with natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is in another situation. Dependent on liquid fuel imports and highly dependent on domestic coal, China has moved strategically to become a manufacturing powerhouse for critical minerals, solar, wind, batteries, and electric vehicles (EVs). As the world looks toward an energy transition, much of the critical materials and processing capacity will reside in China. Yet the sheer size of China’s economy and its continued reliance on coal has meant that even as it deploys more renewables than its peers and economic growth is slowing, its emissions have continued to rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese demand and U.S. supply are two of the key variables in the global oil market. Robust supply outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), especially from the United States, kept oil prices subdued in 2023 despite strong demand growth in China and globally. In 2024, it seems more likely that China’s economic slowdown will dampen its oil consumption. Oil market observers will closely monitor China’s crude imports, its use of domestic inventories, and its refined product exports for signs the country is making more overt efforts to manage the market and leverage its status as the world’s largest importer. In the United States, the two key questions will be whether the shale patch can again outperform expectations and how the Biden administration might manage a run-up in gasoline prices as elections approach. Macroeconomic trends in both countries are essential parts of the oil market story and will continue to be so in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On climate, cooperation between the two countries has waned in recent years. The combined commitment of the United States and China allowed the Paris Agreement to set truly global climate goals in 2015. Last fall, just ahead of the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28), the two countries signed the Sunnylands statement to express their mutual commitment to increasing their ambitions for meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. The agreement marked a renewal of official climate cooperation, but while a welcome development, this approach can deliver only so much. There are fewer straightforward areas of bilateral cooperation on climate compared to just a few years ago. As a result, much of the recent effort has focused on technical issues, and another political breakthrough seems far off. Moreover, Chinese special envoy for climate change Xie Zhenhua has now retired, and U.S. special presidential envoy John Kerry is headed for retirement as well. The case for cooperation risks retiring with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, competition between the two countries is rising. China has introduced export controls on gallium, germanium, and graphite — minerals important for security and energy technologies. Further restrictions on technology for refining rare earths have been announced. In the United States, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are designed for competing with China as well as for reducing emissions. New subsidies for manufacturing clean energy technology in the United States are leading to significant domestic investment, but Chinese dominance in those supply chains means more political fights over the licensing of Chinese technology by U.S. firms and Chinese foreign direct investment in clean energy. Green protectionism seems ascendant. The United States already levies a 27.5 percent import tariff on Chinese EVs but is considering raising them in 2024 to forestall imports via Mexico. Europe is also responding to the looming market dominance of low-cost EVs from China through an antisubsidy investigation. Further, proposals to raise carbon border charges on Chinese imports, inspired by the European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, are gaining popularity on Capitol Hill. China is adamantly opposed to such measures, portending larger trade conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is at the heart of a key challenge for the United States in the energy transition. Faster deployment of renewable energy based on Chinese technology could cede long-term advantages to a key geopolitical competitor. Capturing more investment and prioritizing local content have clearly made climate policy saleable to a broader constituency in the United States but could slow the transition on the margins. Nearly every country planning for the transition faces this same challenge, but the stakes of the U.S.-China relationship make it more severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where a new characteristic of the U.S.-China relationship may emerge. One of the most interesting parts of the Sunnylands statement is the pledge from each country to support five large-scale projects for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) by 2030. The countries share a goal of reducing global emissions. CCUS is a technology that can accomplish this directly by capturing carbon where there is too much of it and storing or using it elsewhere. To deploy it at scale, the United States and China do not need to cooperate or compete, share technology or finance tools, or spurn each other; they simply need to both deploy it. By acting coherently, they can address global problems without overly advantaging one or the other. This will require agreeing on the rules of the game, including discussing and agreeing on global standards in a variety of areas, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, the United States and China are a powerful economic and geopolitical duo. The countries host the world’s two largest economies and are jointly responsible for 43 percent of carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels. Their economic trajectories shape global markets, and the world cannot adequately address climate change without both countries finding a path to reduce emissions. The United States and China are also important as leaders in technology, innovation, and global politics. The choices these two countries make about how to invest in energy systems and how much to prioritize reducing emissions set technology trends and reverberate with firms, financiers, and foreign governments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Now, friends, we come together at a moment of revolution, not one of weapons or of political power, but a revolution in science and understanding that will change humanity. It’s been said that what the locomotive and electricity did for human muscle a century and a half ago, artificial intelligence is doing for human knowledge today as we speak. But the effect of AI is far more profound and will certainly occur over a much shorter period of time.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;existential-risk-became-a-mainstream-concern-for-ai-governance&quot;&gt;Existential risk became a mainstream concern for AI governance.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the risk of AI leading to catastrophe or human extinction had been a focus for Elon Musk and many AI researchers in prior years, 2023 saw the issue become a genuine priority among global leaders and government policymakers. The shift was led by calls from high-profile figures in the private sector such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, Tesla and xAI CEO Elon Musk, and AI “godfather” Geoffrey Hinton. In May, a coalition of over 350 leading AI experts and executives signed a one-sentence statement that “mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.” This statement immediately led to a rhetorical shift among global policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concern about AI’s malign impact on civilization trickled down to the wider U.S. public. A survey of more than 20,000 Americans by YouGov in April 2023 reported that 46 percent were concerned about AI’s potential to cause human extinction and 69 percent supported a proposed six-month pause on AI development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar anxieties about the potential catastrophic risk of AI echoed around Washington last year. At a congressional hearing in May, Sam Altman warned that AI could “cause significant harm to the world” and urgently called for greater regulation of the technology. IBM vice president and chief privacy and trust officer Christina Montgomery concurred, “with AI the stakes are simply too high,” and “what we need at this pivotal moment is clear, reasonable policy and sound guardrails.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the UK AI Safety Summit, 29 countries attending agreed to the Bletchley Declaration, which stated that “there is potential for serious, even catastrophic, harm, either deliberate or unintentional, stemming from the most significant capabilities of these AI models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-states-the-netherlands-and-japan-coordinated-export-controls-to-target-chinas-ai-and-semiconductor-technology-development---&quot;&gt;The United States, the Netherlands, and Japan coordinated export controls to target China’s AI and semiconductor technology development . . .&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late January 2023, reports emerged that the United States had reached an agreement with the Netherlands and Japan for the two countries to impose new export controls restricting China’s access to chipmaking tools. Earlier, on October 7, 2022, the United States had imposed strict controls on exports of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) technology to China; however, as Japanese and Dutch companies produced important SME technology, such unilateral action had a limited effect. Details on what was included in these new restrictions were scarce until March 2023, when the two countries formally announced they would be moving forward with export controls on a wide range of semiconductor equipment and technology. Neither country explicitly mentioned China as the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and the Netherlands capture 99 percent of the world’s market share of lithography steppers and scanners — crucial for state-of-the-art AI chips. Therefore, this was a major step forward in the U.S. mission to bar China from gaining the lead in the chip race. Still, other countries like Germany and South Korea are also significant producers in the semiconductor value chain, and the United States will need to persuade them both to get on board with controls if they want to continue to slow China’s technological advancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/38ca7oK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;---however-their-success-in-slowing-chinas-technological-progress-remains-mixed&quot;&gt;. . . However, their success in slowing China’s technological progress remains mixed.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite international efforts to prevent China from making significant technological advancements, the announcement of Huawei’s new Mate60 smartphone raised concerns throughout the national security community about the efficacy of the export controls. On October 17, 2023, the United States’ Bureau of Industry and Security announced updates to the October 7 controls. These updates included additional parameters for chips’ performance density, the restriction of dozens more items of semiconductor equipment, the expansion of licensing requirements to an additional 22 countries that the United States has an arms embargo with, and the addition of 13 companies to the entity list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ai-chatbots-reached-billions-of-users-worldwide-and-continued-growing-rapidly-in-scale&quot;&gt;AI chatbots reached billions of users worldwide and continued growing rapidly in scale.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT reached over one million users in its first week of launch in November 2022. By November 2023, that number had skyrocketed to more than 100 million monthly active users. OpenAI’s success speaks to a wider public entrancement with AI chatbots around the world. Leading AI development companies launched several new large language models (LLMs) last year, including OpenAI’s updated ChatGPT-4, Meta’s LlaMa 2, and Google’s Gemini. The global demand for this technology has prompted many companies to develop chatbots trained on other languages, such as the Arabic model Jais and the Chinese model Ernie Bot, though the United States still leads in the worldwide development of LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language models are getting bigger, both in terms of the data they are trained on and their parameters (GPT-4, for example, is rumored to have up to one trillion parameters, compared to GPT-3’s 175 billion). In fact, models have grown so large that there are legitimate concerns that companies are reaching the limits of the existing available text training data. However, their growing size comes with growing costs. While training costs are rarely disclosed by companies developing LLMs, OpenAI stated that developing and training GPT-4 cost more than $100 million, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei suggested that future training costs could exceed $1 billion. Growing CO2 emissions and water usage from training and operating chatbots are also attracting increased attention in terms of their effect on the environment. What these upward trends mean for AI chatbots’ profitability and scalability remains to be seen this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;major-economies-around-the-world-took-substantial-steps-to-regulate-ai---&quot;&gt;Major economies around the world took substantial steps to regulate AI . . .&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The United States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the transformative potential of AI, the U.S. government began to regulate it through administrative law, acknowledging the imperative to navigate the complexities of AI risks and begin establishing domestic standards. On January 26, 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) unveiled the Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0). Developed in close collaboration with both private and public sectors, the AI RMF serves as a comprehensive tool for organizations engaging with AI technologies and is designed to adapt to the evolving AI landscape. Though the RMF is not intended to be applied as part of formal regulation, many have held the framework up as substantial progress in maturing AI governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Announced in June 2023 at CSIS, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s SAFE Innovation Framework marked a strategic effort to confront the profound changes brought about by AI through “comprehensive legislation.” Since September 2023, Capitol Hill has seen over 150 AI experts gather as part of Senator Schumer’s AI Insight Forums. These forums have covered an array of crucial topics, from AI innovation and workforce considerations to national security and guarding against doomsday scenarios. Notably, the ninth forum, held on December 6, 2023, featured a testimony from the Wadhwani Center’s director, Gregory Allen. This forum focused on maximizing AI development to bolster the United States’ military capabilities, aligning with Senator Schumer’s vision for an “all-hands-on-deck” effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the UK AI Safety Summit, the Biden administration announced its Executive Order on Safe, Secure and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in late October 2023. The order broadly focused on the development of standards and testing mechanisms for AI safety, infrastructure, and social consequences (such as discrimination and effects on labor). Since the announcement, executive agencies like the Department of Defense (DOD) and State Department have released their policies on AI and detailed how the executive order’s directives will be applied in their respective agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;We face a genuine inflection point in history, one of those moments where the decisions we made in the very near term are going to set the course for the next decades. And with the position we lead the world, the toughest challenges are the greatest opportunities. Look, there’s no greater change that I can think of in my life than AI presents as a potential: exploring the universe, fighting climate change, ending cancer as we know it, and so much more.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The European Union&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 8, the European Union passed its Artificial Intelligence Act, the world’s most substantial set of regulations on AI so far. After two and a half years in the making, the act was finally agreed upon following a lengthy 37-hour negotiation between EU states and the European Parliament. EU commissioner Thierry Breton confirmed the event on X, stating that “the EU becomes the very first continent to set clear rules for the use of AI” in passing the AI Act and calling it a “launch pad for EU start-ups and researchers to lead the global AI race.” Not all EU leaders agree, however; French president Emmanuel Macron condemned the act on December 11, saying “we can decide to regulate much faster and much stronger than our major competitors. But we will regulate things that we will no longer produce or invent. This is never a good idea.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI Act regulates all AI sold, used, or deployed within the European Union apart from AI used for military purposes, research, and open-source models, though most provisions only apply to the “high-risk” AI systems. It advances a risk-based approach to managing AI systems by sorting levels of risk into four categories: unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal to none. Unacceptable risks banned under the act include the use of AI for manipulating human behavior, social scoring, and creating biometric databases based on sensitive social categories such as race or religion. The consequences for failing to comply with these rules are steep: under the new rules, companies could be fined €35 million or 7 percent of global revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full implementation of the new AI law is not expected to begin until 2025 at the earliest, allowing time for the European Commission to establish a regulatory oversight “AI office” in Brussels and companies to adapt to the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2023, China’s generative AI measures went into effect. At the time, these measures were some of the most comprehensive regulations on AI and focused on a regulatory framework for generative AI services to the Chinese public. Earlier in the year, China released a draft that placed significant responsibility onto service providers on topics like ensuring the legality of the data used for training and optimization. Service providers would be met with a fine upwards of 100,000 yuan if they failed to meet these standards. However, the finalized version only requires the service providers to create measures that prioritize desired values within data training and optimization. Shifting from the strict first draft to a more diluted final draft is likely a reflection of industry input as well as sensitivity to the current economic challenges that China is facing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures apply to any AI generative technology that provides services that “generate any text, image, audio, video, or other such content to the public.” Services that are not offered to the public are explicitly excluded from the legislation. Additionally, prior to providing services to the public, service providers must apply for a security assessment. In implementation, these have not been difficult to get approved. Chinese military, intelligence, and police services remain broadly exempt from all Chinese AI regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, the Chinese government announced its Global AI Governance Initiative at the third Belt and Road forum. Xi Jinping unveiled the initiative personally, underscoring China’s AI governance ambitions, which include enhancing information exchange and technological cooperation with other countries; developing open, fair, and efficient governing mechanisms; and establishing an international institution within the UN framework to govern AI. The initiative calls for representation and equal rights when developing AI, regardless of a country’s “size, strength, or social system.” The announcement came just weeks after the creation of a BRICS AI study group which aimed to foster closer AI governance ties among the participating nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global efforts to govern AI increased dramatically in 2023. The United Kingdom hosted the first global AI Safety Summit on November 1–2, convening political and technology leaders for discussions focusing on foundation model safety. Attendees included summit host Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, Vice President Kamala Harris, prominent tech CEOs, and, to the surprise of many, China’s vice minister of science and technology, Wu Zhaohui. The most significant achievement of the summit was the Bletchley Declaration, which Sunak called a “landmark achievement that sees the world’s greatest AI powers agree on the urgency behind understanding the risks of AI.” The declaration broadly aims to promote transparency and accountability within companies developing frontier AI models and to develop AI safety evaluation metrics, tools, and research capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI also featured prominently in G7 meetings in 2023, including the Digital and Technology Ministers’ Meeting in April and the G7 summit in May. The group released the G7 leaders’ statement, the Hiroshima Process International Guiding Principles for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems, and the Hiroshima Process International Code of Conduct for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems. The code of conduct was the most consequential of the documents, laying out a set of voluntary guidelines for developing advanced AI systems, such as foundation models and generative AI. It is worth noting that these documents set out voluntary guidelines as opposed to binding international regulations. The G7 countries will also publish the Hiroshima AI Process Comprehensive Policy Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several other international assemblies gathered in 2023 to discuss AI for the first time. In February, the Responsible AI in the Military Domain Summit (REAIM) in The Hague, Netherlands, convened ministers to discuss the responsible use of AI for military applications. In July, the United Nations Security Council met to discuss AI risk, at which Secretary-General António Guterres called for the creation of a UN body “to support collective efforts to govern this extraordinary technology.” The urgent need for international cooperation on balancing potential risks and benefits from AI was a common theme across all these governance efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What remains to be seen is how international pledges will translate into real-world impact in 2024. Last year brought many voluntary commitments and high-level declarations. This is a start. But perhaps the greater challenge will be seeing how the grittier details of legislation, funding, and international standards unfold within a window of interest that may not last forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-private-sector-emphasized-its-own-role-in-responsible-ai-governance&quot;&gt;The private sector emphasized its own role in responsible AI governance.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the U.S. government made significant steps to begin regulating AI in 2023, the private companies behind AI development have become more, not less, important in pursuing this goal. The government was proactive last year in collaborating with industry leaders to responsibly manage AI. This action has come, in part, from a recognition by Congress that it is playing catch-up to a technology and industry that far predates the government’s regulatory efforts in 2023. The majority of AI research and development exists in the private sector, as it takes extremely large datasets, technical expertise, and financial investment to develop the kinds of frontier AI models Congress is seeking to regulate. It would make sense, therefore, that Congress should seek AI companies’ input on AI legislation as it does with other industry leaders in other sectors. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer opened the first AI Insight Forum on September 13, which gathered senators, CEOs, and civil society leaders to discuss AI regulation, noting that “Congress cannot do it alone.” He added, “We need help of course from developers and experts who build AI systems.” The forums accompanied other congressional hearings that heard from AI CEOs like OpenAI’s Sam Altman and IBM’s Christina Montgomery last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to congressional hearings, AI companies were given a greater responsibility to regulate their technologies in 2023 by Biden’s Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence. The order requires AI developers conduct red teaming on their products and report their findings to the government before they are released, placing the onus on companies to do the heavy lifting when it comes to due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the private sector’s growing influence in AI governance is accompanied by growing concerns that there are fundamental conflicts of interest at play. AI companies’ dual role of helping to regulate their innovations as they continue to develop them raises serious questions about whether they can truly place safety over profit. As Marietje Shaake, international policy director at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center, wrote in the Financial Times, “Imagine the chief executive of JPMorgan explaining to Congress that because financial products are too complex for lawmakers to understand, banks should decide for themselves how to prevent money laundering, enable fraud detection and set liquidity to loan ratios. He would be laughed out of the room.” Just as lawmakers are not experts in other industries for which they craft legislation, she and others argue, they must be careful to not be captured by AI CEOs who use technical complexity to advance their own regulatory interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-number-of-ai-related-lawsuits-rose-sharply&quot;&gt;The number of AI-related lawsuits rose sharply.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New AI tools began to test existing legal frameworks in 2023, cutting across domains such as data privacy, copyright, and patent law. So far, the leading cause for lawsuits related to AI is related to data privacy, perhaps unsurprising considering the billions of data points that generative AI models are trained on from across the internet. AI companies have been resistant to revealing their training data thus far, despite long-running calls for greater transparency and concerns about user privacy from academics and civil society groups. A reported hack of ChatGPT in early December highlighted some basis for these concerns: when asked to repeat certain words like “poem” ad infinitum, ChatGPT eventually began to spit out sensitive training data, including phone numbers, names, and addresses. OpenAI has since closed this loophole by restricting ChatGPT from repeating words forever. It also announced in August that website owners can now block the company’s data-scraping web crawler, GPTBot, from accessing their pages and data for training purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenAI has been one of many AI companies to face several lawsuits in 2023 due to alleged privacy and intellectual property violations. One class action lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft made headlines in June 2023 when it claimed that ChatGPT stole millions of sensitive data from hundreds of millions of internet users during training, including from social media accounts, medical records, and personal accounts. Though the complaint was dismissed in court, it was not the only one of its kind; a second lawsuit was filed against the same two companies in September and another, nearly identical, lawsuit was filed against Google parent company Alphabet in July. As of the time of writing, both cases are ongoing, though all three companies have moved to dismiss them in court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of AI for copyright law have also come under greater scrutiny in the last year. In 2023, Getty Images filed lawsuits in the United States and the United Kingdom against generative AI company Stability AI for training its model, Stable Diffusion, on copyrighted data and metadata. OpenAI, Alphabet, and Microsoft faced multiple class action cases from authors whose work, they claim, has been similarly used for training purposes without proper licensing or compensation. Text-to-image AI generators like Midjourney, DreamStudio, and DreamUp were the subject of a similar lawsuit filed in January by visual artists whose work has been used and replicated without permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several companies, such as Meta, Microsoft, and Google, argued they should not have to pay to train AI models on copyrighted work, citing arguments such as AI training “is like the act of reading a book” and curbing access to copyrighted access would chill AI development. These kinds of arguments ask fundamental questions about AI regulation, like whether the unique characteristics of the technology should exempt it from certain laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the U.S. Federal Court Circuit upheld a precedent in patent law when it ruled in August that AI systems are not eligible to own patents for their “inventions” as they are not human beings. The verdict confirmed earlier rulings made by the U.S. Patent Office and the U.S. Copyright Office following years of legal disputes by U.S. computer scientist Stephen Thaler, who first tried to copyright an image produced by his AI system in 2019. Federal Circuit Judge Leonard Stark announced the decision in August saying “there is no ambiguity: the Patent Act requires that inventors must be natural persons; that is, human beings.” The ruling reflects similar decisions made in the United Kingdom and the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-department-of-defense-took-steps-to-safely-adopt-and-deploy-ai-in-its-weapons-systems---&quot;&gt;The Department of Defense took steps to safely adopt and deploy AI in its weapons systems . . .&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States was the first country to codify a policy on autonomy in weapon systems when it first adopted DOD Directive 3000.09 in 2012. The policy did not ban the development or use of autonomous weapons — indeed many types of autonomous weapons, such as some missile defense and cyber weapons, had already been in use for decades. What 3000.09 did was place new policy and process requirements for the development and use of autonomous weapons in offensive and kinetic constructs. However, the policy was widely misunderstood as requiring “a human in the loop” and thus banning fully autonomous systems, which it did not do. In January 2023, the DOD published an updated 3000.09 that sought to address the confusion and to account for the rise in machine learning AI systems. Among other things, it formalized that adherence to the Department of Defense (DOD)’s AI Ethical Principles was a requirement at all stages of development and fielding. Reaffirmed by Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, the directive mandates rigorous testing, reviews, and senior-level scrutiny for autonomous systems, aligning with the DOD’s Ethical Principles and the Responsible AI (RAI) Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the international front, the U.S. Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence, and Stability unveiled a ground-breaking “Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy.” This declaration is fully consistent with the ideas underpinning DOD 3000.09 and seeks to make them international, particularly among U.S. allies. Introduced at the Responsible AI in the Military Domain Summit, this initiative has since garnered signatures of support from 49 countries, promoting non-legally-binding guidelines for secure AI deployment in defense contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;---and-to-massively-accelerate-the-dods-adoption-of-ai-enabled-autonomous-systems&quot;&gt;. . . and to massively accelerate the DOD’s adoption of AI-enabled autonomous systems.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 28, 2023, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks announced the Replicator initiative. Replicator aims to “field attritable autonomous systems at scale of multiple thousands, in multiple domains, within the next 18-to-24 months.” The DOD intends for the initiative to counter China’s perceived advantage in military “mass” by rapidly acquiring and fielding large quantities of small, attritable, and relatively cheap drones. Reports suggest that this initiative was informed by analysis of the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replicator will not solely focus on acquiring such systems; it will also build the processes that allow for “replicating the rapid adoption and delivery of technology.” This line of effort will try and build a pipeline that will enable similar efforts in the future. The Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) will play a central role in Replicator, both working with Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) end users to establish what capabilities the warfighter needs and exploring which industry partners can provide those capabilities within the relevant time frame. At least for now, the DOD is not requesting any additional funding for Replicator; instead, the initiative will take advantage of “existing funding, existing programming lines, and existing authorities.” DOD officials claim the first Replicator systems will be delivered sometime between February and August 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;corporate-interest-in-ai-surged-but-the-magnificent-seven-ai-tech-giants-continued-to-capture-stock-markets-and-global-attention&quot;&gt;Corporate interest in AI surged, but the “Magnificent Seven” AI tech giants continued to capture stock markets and global attention.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI was the magic word of 2023 for firms worldwide. Business intelligence company CB Insights reported that private investment in generative AI reached an all-time high last year with an almost 450 percent increase from $3.2 billion in 2022 to $17.4 billion by Q3 2023. As of March 2023, mentions of AI in executives’ earnings calls — where CEOs discuss corporate performance and strategies with investors and leading analysts — had grown by 77 percent compared to 2022. By September, that figure accelerated to a further 366 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EY’s October CEO Outlook Pulse Survey, which interviews 1,200 CEOs globally every quarter, revealed that nearly all CEOs (99 percent) are conscious of AI’s potential to disrupt current business models and are planning investments into generative AI, either by redirecting capital from other projects (69 percent) or by raising new capital (23 percent). However, the rapid change of the AI ecosystem is a significant barrier to companies’ adoption of the technology: 26 percent stated that the breakneck speed in which AI is developing makes investments risky, while another 66 percent stated that the surrounding hype makes it difficult to ascertain whether other companies have legitimate AI capabilities for partnerships and mergers and acquisitions. To what extent companies effectively adopt AI tools into their business models once the hype settles remains to be seen in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, leading technology companies saw enormous returns in 2023. The “Magnificent Seven” (a term given to Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Tesla, and Nvidia) continued to dominate the stock market last year, breaking the record for holding the largest proportion of the S&amp;amp;P 500’s market cap at 29 percent. Goldman Sachs reported that the seven companies’ stocks accounted for 71 percent of total returns in 2023 while all other 493 other stocks made up just 6 percent. While comparably smaller AI companies have still attracted a surge in investment — including 15 new AI unicorns in 2023 as of Q3 — the lion’s share of attention in AI was focused on tech giants in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rapid-technological-progress-showed-no-signs-of-slowing-down&quot;&gt;Rapid technological progress showed no signs of slowing down.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2023 was a groundbreaking year for AI, in terms of both raw model capability and the technology’s capacity to deliver remarkable breakthroughs in an increasing number of scientific fields. The end of the year saw a leap in generative AI capabilities as Google released its new multimodal system, Gemini, in December, possibly foreshadowing a new era for LLMs. “Multi-modal” describes models that can process data from a variety of inputs, such as text, video, image, or audio, and can produce outputs in a similar array of forms. Unlike other LLMs like OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4, Gemini is natively multimodal, meaning it was trained on diverse inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year also brought significant breakthroughs in AI chip capabilities. Nvidia reached a technological milestone in May 2023 when it unveiled the world’s first 100-terabyte GPU memory system in its new semiconductor model DGX GH200. The new chip is a significant advancement compared to the company’s earlier models, particularly the DGX A100, and it provides over 500 times more memory to the GPU shared memory programming model compared to a single DGX A100 320 GB system. These advanced chips open the potential for faster, more efficient AI models and computing systems — advances to look forward to in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, AI continued to revolutionize an increasingly diverse number of scientific fields. In 2023, AI models from Google DeepMind made significant breakthroughs in both material science, predicting “ingredients and properties of another 2.2 million materials,” and meteorology, with its GraphCast model. Earlier in the year, Huawei published a similar model called Pangu-Weather. These breakthroughs could reveal new materials and methods to construct novel batteries, superconductors, and catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global AI governance talks resulted in significant high-level commitments in 2023, from the Bletchley Declaration signed at the United Kingdom’s AI Safety Summit to the Hiroshima AI Process set in motion under the Japanese G7 presidency last year. How will such commitments translate into actionable policies and enforceable regulations in 2024?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden’s AI executive order requires that AI developers evaluate their frontier models through a practice called red teaming, in which adversarial attacks are simulated to assess the vulnerabilities and robustness of a model. Developers will be required to report their findings to the government before the model is released to the public. How will third-party red teaming work in practice, and will the government be able to use the findings to keep up with the growing size and capabilities of LLMs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden’s AI executive order was a step toward U.S. AI regulation, but its efficacy depends upon Congress passing legislation and budget allowances. Will AI regulation remain a largely bipartisan issue, and how quickly can it pass through Congress given the expected tough timing with 2024 elections?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the Japanese presidency put AI on the G7 agenda and committed to coordinating AI governance efforts under the Hiroshima AI Process. Interoperability between governance frameworks is a daunting yet essential task for avoiding a fragmented global AI landscape, and one that Italy has signaled it will pursue this year. What steps will the Italian presidency take to move the Hiroshima AI Process forward and to deliver the G7’s commitment to harmonized AI regulation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD’s Replicator initiative is a comprehensive effort by the United States to accelerate the delivery of AI-enabled autonomous systems to warfighters at speed and scale. The program aims to address strategic competition with China, a subject of critical importance. What will happen if the DOD receives only token funding?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei’s late August release of the Mate60 Pro raised serious questions about the enforceability of U.S. and allied export controls and their impact on China’s technological trajectory.

&lt;p&gt;2024 is the biggest election year in history, with over half of the world’s population heading to the polls. It will be the first year that political parties must define their stance regarding AI, and some voters may see AI regulation featured as a question on their ballots. Both would have been almost unthinkable only a year ago. It will also be the first election cycle in which AI will likely play a significant role in election campaigning, interference, and spreading disinformation. How might the world’s busiest election year fare with AI in the mix?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open- versus closed-source debate largely revolves around whether AI development should prioritize transparency, collaboration, and accessibility (open source) or proprietary control, safety, competitive advantage, and intellectual property protection (closed source). Who will emerge victorious in this debate and what implications could this have for AI’s future development, regulation, and democratization?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;open-sourcing&quot;&gt;Open sourcing&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Making the source code and development details of a software project publicly available; this allows others to contribute, modify, and use the code in their own projects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;prompt&quot;&gt;Prompt&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A specific instruction given to an AI model to generate a desired output, guiding the model’s behavior and responses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;red-teaming&quot;&gt;Red teaming&lt;/h4&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;transformer&quot;&gt;Transformer&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A state-of-the-art neural network architecture used in advanced machine learning research. Transformers use a technique called “self-attention” to quickly learn the contextual relationship between data points (e.g., words), allowing it to generate more accurate predictions faster. Initially developed for natural language processing, they are now used for a variety of applications such as computer vision, preventing fraud, or drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;unsupervised-learning&quot;&gt;Unsupervised learning&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A type of machine learning where a model is given training input data without explicit labels. The algorithm explores and finds patterns on its own, and the correctness of the model is often determined by how well it achieves its intended purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these chips are dual-use in that they have military applications as well as civilian ones, most of them end up in the latter category running our computers, automobiles, and, thanks to the internet of things, our refrigerators, toasters, and heating systems. The problem is that we may be about to be buried in imports of these chips from China directly and indirectly. One explanation for that is the U.S. export controls on high end chips and manufacturing technology are pushing China to focus on the low end, but I think it’s more fundamental than that, and it’s a movie we’ve seen before. When the government allocates credit rather than the market, you inevitably get overinvestment, overcapacity, overproduction, and then global dumping, as China exports its excess production and attempts to capture market share and drive foreign competitors out of business. That has happened in steel, aluminum, wind turbines, solar panels, and is about to happen with legacy chips and electric vehicles. Coming down the road are commercial aircraft. Governments, including the United States and European Union, are thinking about what tools they have to deal with this and whether there are new ones they need to put in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the United States has three tools it can use to combat this tactic, and none of them are short. If any action is ultimately taken, it will more likely be in 2025 than this year. The first is to treat this as a traditional dumping and subsidy problem. To prevail, you have to prove that the offense has occurred, and that you have been injured by it. The remedy is a tariff in the amount of dumping or subsidy. While this is the logical approach legally, there are problems with it. Filing a case is expensive, and the investigation usually takes a year or more. A bigger issue for chips, however, is these laws are designed to combat imported items, but many more chips enter the country as part of a different end product — car or computer, for example — than as chips. In such cases, the subsidized import is the car, not just the chips in it. Complaints can still be brought (if a part or component is subsidized, the end product benefited from the subsidy as well) but they must be brought by the affected industry — in this example autos, not chip manufacturers. Since many of the chips in question cost only pennies per unit, the amount of the subsidy will only be a small percentage of the car’s price, making it a less effective remedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which permits the president to take trade actions to protect our national security. Former president Trump used this law to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, which shrouded the provision in controversy. The U.S. has lost World Trade Organization (WTO) cases on its use of the provision and will continue to do so. The process is a bit less than a year, the shortest of the three options, but still long. If substance matters, use of the provision is complicated because it is often hard to agree on what constitutes a national security threat. Many experts disagreed with the steel and aluminum decisions on the merits, and a decision on legacy chips would likely produce the same disagreement. There would also be debate over the negative economic impact if chip imports were banned or had high tariffs attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have the all-purpose trade statute — Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which authorizes presidential action against unfair or unjustifiable acts after a 12-month investigation by the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). This provision was largely dormant from 1994 to 2018 because the United States had agreed in the Uruguay Round to only use it in conjunction with a favorable WTO panel decision. Trump ignored that commitment and revived it to justify extensive tariffs on Chinese imports, which the Biden administration has not removed. That use of the provision has also led to unfavorable WTO outcomes. USTR seems to have some affection for this provision, but it has not yet taken any new actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these tools have provided relief to various sectors in the past, there are two problems with them when it comes to chips. First is the problem mentioned above — legacy chips most often enter the country as components of a different product. Tariffs solely on chip imports would have a limited impact, while tariffs or other limits on imports of the many products that contain them would have a significant inflationary impact on the economy. Second, as in the case of steel, our tools are unilateral while the basic problems of over-capacity and over-production are multilateral. Restraining imports into the United States is like squeezing a balloon — the imports simply pop up somewhere else, which means China does not pay a price for its policy. However, producing a multilateral action plan when there are few producers is difficult. Asking a country that does not make chips to impose tariffs on them in the interest of countering Chinese policy will only produce an eye roll. We would be asking them to raise costs to their manufacturers in order to accommodate our companies’ interests. Not likely to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: this is a serious problem with long-term consequences for the global economy, but dealing with it effectively will be a lot more difficult than people think.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;對談節目邀美國退休軍官 張劍虹一度表憂慮 黎智英回應「我一定去到盡」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/K26hXlb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（26日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第17日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。就直播節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」，張稱得悉會邀請前美軍副參謀長 Jack Keane 任嘉賓後，擔心被指勾結外國勢力，遂向黎表示：「呢啲時候請呢啲退休軍官，會唔會好敏感？」張憶述當時黎回應：「佢哋（中共）咁搞我，我一定去到盡㗎，我冇得褪㗎。」另外，張形容黎希望特朗普可以連任美國總統，又相信他即將出手實施制裁，因此吩咐員工報導選舉辯論時不要寫太多攻擊特朗普的言論。控方表示主問完畢，辯方申請押後至下周一（29日）才開始盤問證人，獲法官批准。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹確認直播節目邀請多名外國嘉賓-曾表達憂敏感-黎回應去到盡我冇得縮&quot;&gt;張劍虹確認直播節目邀請多名外國嘉賓 曾表達憂敏感 黎回應「去到盡」、「我冇得縮」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方在庭上展示WhatsApp群組「English news」的訊息，顯示前動新聞平台總監張志偉每周均會發送訊息至群組，通知黎及其他高層有關「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目時間及嘉賓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹確認，曾出席節目的嘉賓包括：前美軍前副參謀長 Jack Keane、美國前副國防部長 Paul Wolfowitz、前港督彭定康、以色列前副總理 Natan Sharansky、美國在台協會前主席 Raymond Burghardt、「香港監察」創辦人 Benedict Rogers，以及壹傳媒獨立非執行董事、《南華早報》前總編輯 Mark Clifford。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及 Jack Keane 是誰，張指是美國的退休軍官。被問及如何得知 Jack Keane 的身份，張憶述黎在一次對話中曾提及：「最近啲嘉賓都好猛」，並指 Jack Keane 是退休軍官，很有影響力。張聞言後表達憂慮：「呢啲時候請呢啲退休軍官，會唔會好敏感？」張記得當時黎回應：「以我做咗生意幾十年，以我做生意嘅直覺，佢哋（中共）咁搞我，我一定去到盡㗎，我冇得褪㗎。」張憶述：「我聽到黎生咁講之後就冇表達意見喇，我就同黎生傾其他事項。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問黎稱「去到盡」是什麼意思。張指黎當時未有解釋「去到盡」的意思，「但佢就話『我冇得縮㗎』」，以張多年來對黎的認識，他理解「去到盡」的意思是「請呢啲咁勁嘅嘉賓，講要講嘅嘢」，並請求外國提供保護。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續問張，當時向黎表達意見時有什麼憂慮。張指黎早前被拘捕，獲得警方擔保，當時即將要續保，所以當黎在會議室提起節目嘉賓時，張才會說出上述說話：「啫係呢啲時候請啲退休軍官會唔會太敏感呢？」控方追問「敏感」的意思，張說：「啫係勾結外國勢力囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎智英live-chat節目在fb累計有57000人次觀看&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎智英Live Chat節目在FB累計有57,000人次觀看&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有訊息提到「果燃台」，張劍虹解釋它是《蘋果》網站入面的一個影片平台，主要播放遊行直播、黎的 Live Chat 直播和對談節目。至於軟件程式 ZOOM，張則指黎一直提議使用 ZOOM 來做直播，當黎開啟 ZOOM 的聊天室功能，讀者便可以加入參與聊天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中張志偉於2020年8月30日的訊息指，黎 Live Chat 節目的 Facebook 直播最高峰有2,000多人同步觀看，當時累計已有57,000人次觀看過；而 Twitter 直播則最高峰約有近1,000人同步觀看，累計有12,000人次看過，並指上述數字是節目以來最高紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英相信特朗普快將出手制裁-指示同事不要針對特朗普&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英相信特朗普快將出手制裁 指示同事不要針對特朗普&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上再展示黎智英於2020年6月2日發送給張劍虹的訊息：「裕鑫，請國際組同事不要跟紐約時報及CNN針對川普，我們蘋果卻要靠川普政府支持保命，這樣做不太好。謝謝。黎」，張回覆「老闆，收到。我上週也請香港國際同事留意。謝謝」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張解釋，當時《蘋果》發起「一人一信救香港」，黎亦很密集地接受外媒採訪，「佢嗰時覺得 Trump 會好快做嘢，同埋會 take 啲好大嘅制裁行動。嗰時 Trump 講過中國行《國安法》會有好嚴重後果，咁上下嘅嘢，所以黎生嗰時好期望 Trump 好快出手」，於是指示員工不要揀選太多針對特朗普的譯文，包括 CNN 和《紐約時報》。張又指「靠川普政府支持保命」中的「支持」意指政治支持。張表示，他收到黎的指示後，便轉達給前總編輯羅偉光、前副社長陳沛敏和國際組同事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又補充，後來約2020年9月進入美國總統大選期，兩名候選人特朗普和拜登出席公開辯論，「咁國際版嘅同事有時會兩邊意見都表達出嚟，但黎生都吩咐攻擊 Trump 嘅說話都唔好寫咁多」，而且「黎生都好希望 Trump 可以連任嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹李怡寫反共逆權和攬炒-是黎心儀的專欄作者&quot;&gt;張劍虹：李怡寫反共、逆權和攬炒 是黎心儀的專欄作者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示已故專欄作家李怡傳送給張劍虹的訊息：「劍虹兄：年紀老邁，最近感精力不繼，打算自下月起，每週減寫兩篇世道人生，即星期一三五刊出，繼續寫時評。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問「世道人生」是指什麼，張劍虹指，李怡於2000年代起擔任《蘋果》的專欄作家，刊於論壇版「世道人生」，乃由黎智英親自邀請。當時李怡逢星期一至五，每天均會發布專欄文章，惟他指自己年紀大，所以提出減少撰寫文章數目。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指，李以前是月刊《七十年代》的總編輯，亦是一名對共產黨很熟悉的作家，主要寫政治文章，內容提及反共、逆權和「攬炒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，「佢（李怡）一路都係老闆（黎智英）好心儀嘅作者，佢喺《蘋果》寫咗不下十幾二十年，一路都係符合老闆黎先生嘅方向。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂向張展示兩篇由李怡撰寫的專欄文章，包括《攬炒的最佳時機》（刊於2020年6月24日）和《夜行人吹口哨》（刊於2020年8月10日）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹員工擔心國安法影響-高層設立國安法應變委員會群組&quot;&gt;張劍虹：員工擔心國安法影響 高層設立「國安法應變委員會」群組&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指，《蘋果》員工關注《國安法》對於公司的影響、擔心「紅線放喺邊」，有的更考慮辭職，有見及此，高層設立了 WhatsApp 群組「國安法應變委員會」，不過黎並非該群組成員之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月2日，即《國安法》生效之後，前執行總編輯林文宗向群組發出訊息：「Signal有口訊自焚功能，不留紀錄。我建議呢個谷可轉去Signal」，張之後回覆「好！我唔識，不如阿敏重開一個」。張確認後來他們轉至另一個通訊軟件 Signal 創立一個新群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張解釋，當時有傳《國安法》實施之後，連 WhatsApp 通訊都變得不安全，若果高層想討論一些「敏感啲嘅話題，例如文章係咪建議去做、紅線呢啲」，希望通訊可以較保密。控方追問「敏感話題」和「紅線」是什麼意思，張則舉例指，民主黨打算於7月1日街站派發有關抗爭的海報，黎智英希望該海報能加上《蘋果日報》的標誌，當時眾人曾經討論是否應該如此做，擔心予人感覺《蘋果》與政黨關係太過密切，最終該海報亦有加上《蘋果》標誌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張憶述，他於2020年7月初加入新的 Signal 群組，討論話題亦包括廣告事宜，後來黎智英還柙，有同事去探訪他，「黎生有啲說話，大家都會喺度分享啦。」控方問上述話題與 Signal 的訊息自焚功能有何關係，惟張表示：「我記唔起有啲好⋯⋯覺得有必要銷毀嘅訊息。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹161篇涉案文章均是按黎智英指示立場和方針來發表&quot;&gt;張劍虹：161篇涉案文章均是按黎智英指示、立場和方針來發表&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹在本周一曾到庭閉門閱讀161篇涉案文章，他確認該些文章在2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日發布，內容鼓吹抗爭和請求外國制裁。張續指：「呢啲文章全部係按黎生的編採指示、立場、方針嚟發表嘅。而我作為社長，同其他管理層都係按住職能，跟住黎生嘅編採指示嚟發表文章嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張補充，陳沛敏和林文宗專責實體報紙；羅偉光負責網上新聞；馮偉光負責整個英文版的運作；楊清奇則統籌論壇版，亦會撰寫社評；而張自己作社長，「係要確保黎生嘅編採政策和方針，係準確地執行到出嚟啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示沒有其他問題，主問完成。代表黎的資深大律師彭耀鴻申請押後至下周一（29日）才開始盤問證人，以讓辯方法律團隊整理過去數天證供，使盤問能更有組織和集中。法官杜麗冰認同這是恰當做法，遂押後至下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告黎智英（76歲）否認一項「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」及兩項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李運騰和李素蘭審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英的律師團隊包括資深大律師彭耀鴻和大律師 Marc Corlett、關文渭、黃雅斌、董皓哲及李峰琦。3間蘋果日報公司清盤人由大律師王國豪代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方由副刑事檢控專員周天行、署理助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤、高級檢控官吳加悅及陳穎琛等代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同案8名被告：前行政總裁張劍虹、前總編輯羅偉光、前副社長陳沛敏、前執行總編輯林文宗、前英文主筆馮偉光、前主筆楊清奇、李宇軒和陳梓華，早前已承認「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，現正還柙，等待黎智英審訊完畢後判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

Thus far, less attention has been given to societal readiness for war, but there are signs that this imbalance is starting to be addressed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea was an insufficient wake-up call for NATO. The Eastern European members got it, but others largely dismissed Moscow’s aggression, just like in Georgia in 2008. The follow-on large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was too severe to ignore, and sparked NATO’s warfighting transformation. Its 2022 Strategic Concept finally called Russia a threat, not a partner, and committed to defending “every inch of NATO territory”. It has hardened its military posture, doubling its multinational battlegroups from four to eight, stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European militaries were also exposed as having been “hollowed out” – the UK had no more than a week’s worth of artillery ammunition to keep it in the fight, the German Bundeswehr just two days. Therefore, the last two years of planning has focused on the military, and not society, component of warfare. Now, however, there are signs of a coordinated effort across the Alliance to engage civil society more broadly and prepare it for war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-call-to-arms&quot;&gt;A Call to Arms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, the UK Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Patrick Sanders, warned that the UK public would need to be called up to fight if war with Russia was declared, calling for the government to “mobilise the nation”. The General, who steps down in six months, is on the record as strongly opposing troop cuts to the Army to just 72,500 by 2025, and thus his warning could be easily dismissed as a parting shot. Moreover, while comments about conscription have been picked up by the press, his warnings are more nuanced and go beyond the service that he currently commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real issue is not about conscription, nor is it necessarily about getting more civilians in military uniforms. It is about having an honest discussion with the public on the likely significant impacts that a war would have on the UK’s way of life, its functioning as a civil society and its national institutions, such as the NHS. Some of the UK’s closest allies do this as standard under a total defence model. And while the UK has its own approach to comprehensive security – through the “Fusion Doctrine” – to foster a whole of society approach, General Sanders’ comments could be seen as trying to start a broader debate across UK society, and he is not alone in calling for one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Swedish Civil Defence Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin acknowledged to a defence conference that “there could be war in Sweden”. The Swedish Commander-in-Chief, General Micael Bydén, went further, declaring that all Swedes needed to “prepare for war”. While these comments received some criticism for being alarmist, Sweden operates a total defence model, and the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency has for many years published a brochure for its citizens titled “If Crisis or War comes”. Last week, Admiral Rob Bauer, Chair of the NATO Military Committee and the Alliance’s most senior military officer, warned that NATO could be at war with Russia within 20 years, which would require many civilians having to be mobilised to fight. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius assessed that his country needed between five to eight years to be ready for war, and a leaked German military planning scenario worked on the assumption of hostilities opening with Russia as early as 2025. Recently, German policymakers have openly discussed the return of conscription, which was active from 1956 until 2011, or the introduction of some form of “civic service”. A similar debate has been opened in Sweden. Elsewhere, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas put the timeframe for a potential war with Russia at “three to five years”. Both the Norwegian Chief of Defence and Polish intelligence say three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no collective assessment of the exact timeframe, and obviously the frontline NATO members – who want more support – are likely to publicly assess a tighter deadline for readiness. However, it is striking that two years on from Russia’s invasion, in the space of a month, senior NATO politicians and commanders have started to be more honest with their electorates about the threat and its impacts, suggesting a coordinated effort to prepare society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-has-changed&quot;&gt;What Has Changed?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing obvious in open sources to suggest that the threat posed by Russia has significantly changed such as to warrant this flurry of announcements. The Russian military continues to be fully committed to combat operations in Ukraine. However, there are some potential explanations for this messaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Sober analysis from Ukraine continues to provide planning assumptions for NATO of what a potential future war with Russia might look like and the human capital required&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, and most simply, this could be a case of a hierarchy of needs, with NATO needing to fix its military readiness first before increasing resilience and readiness in the rest of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, almost all NATO militaries, including the US, the UK and Poland, are suffering from recruitment and retention challenges. The projections for the future look bleak unless current trends are corrected. All the additional capabilities that Europeans have purchased in the last two years will not become operational unless the right number of skilled personnel exist to use them. It is a critical vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, NATO is currently adopting its “New Force Model” – its largest military adaption since the end of the Cold War – which has the ambition of a significantly higher number of forces available at higher levels of readiness. Moreover, its new regional defence plans and transatlantic reinforcement plans must be delivered on. In getting to the detail of the “executability” of these plans, it is possible that the Allied Chiefs of Defence are concerned that they might not be enough, or that the requirement for follow-on forces will be greater – especially if there are questions about the viability of the transatlantic reinforcement plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, and linked to the preceding point, sober analysis from Ukraine continues to provide planning assumptions for NATO of what a potential future war with Russia might look like – which would be on a scale never previously experienced by the Alliance – and the human capital required. The situation is extremely challenging, and Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, has requested that President Volodymyr Zelensky order the further mobilisation of 500,000 troops to support defensive operations this year and to prepare for subsequent military offensives in 2025 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, now that 2024 is finally here, Europeans are becoming far more concerned by the spectre of a second Trump presidency in the US. After commanding wins in both the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire Republican primary, he is almost certainly going to be the Republican nominee in November 2024. With his history of anti-NATO and pro-Putin comments, Europeans might finally be starting to realise that they need to do more to make up for any potential US shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-timing-is-right&quot;&gt;The Timing is Right&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the drivers for these warnings, the timing and motive is right for several reasons. First, NATO societies have direct and recent experience of civil-military integration (CIMIC) from providing military support to civil authorities during the Covid-19 pandemic. This valuable experience of civic service must be harnessed and adapted to the current situation. An expansion of civic service would have many resilience benefits, but specifically, it would reduce pressure on the military to act as a ’fourth emergency service’, which significantly impacts military readiness for warfighting. Second, the war in Ukraine and the recent Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea have directly impacted societies – increasing energy costs and causing supply chain disruption, leading to higher prices and increasing the cost-of-living – providing a more captive audience and greater public interest in international security. Third, Finland, long considered an exemplar of comprehensive security, has now joined NATO, soon to be followed by Sweden, providing deep knowledge and expertise which can and should be leveraged by the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Yes, a public debate on conscription would be politically sensitive, but it is clear that the current approach is not working and that it is a critical national security risk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, total defence models are not all created equal, and there is a variation between national approaches, reflecting history, geography, and political sensitivities. Resilience is first and foremost a national competency under NATO’s Article 3, and it should be strengthened from the ground up. The Finnish model of comprehensive security is founded on a deep history of societal resilience, developed during the Second World War and the Cold War. A high proportion of society contributes and says that it would be “prepared to participate” in defence activities. The model is founded on an educational programme, which starts at school and includes national resilience and National Defence Courses that provide a total overview of Finland’s foreign, security and defence policy, with the aim of improving cooperation between different sectors of society. While the approach of one Ally cannot simply be exported to another, adaptions should be made to start this journey, and the recent senior NATO interventions should be considered as a direction to national governments to get moving. This will take time – the Finnish system has taken 80 years to develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-social-contract&quot;&gt;A New Social Contract&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the UK Defence Secretary argued that the world was becoming a more dangerous place. Indeed, the contemporary and future security challenges facing the UK will need a whole-of-society approach. However, the societal dimension cannot be transformed as easily, or as quickly, as the military component. An incremental approach is the best and most politically acceptable route. Therefore, the recent collective NATO announcements should not be seen as an overreaction, but rather as an attempt to start to set the conditions in NATO societies for further developing individual and collective systems, learning from each other, to be better prepared for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important that this should also include a new social contract which is explicit and transparent about national security risks and the costs of both action and inaction. Moreover, it must be non-party political. Indeed, support for Ukraine and the recent UK strikes against Houthi positions in Yemen have fostered unprecedented levels of support from the opposition Labour Party at the operational level, although disagreements are still evident on policy. This may or may not involve a discussion on the pros and cons of conscription or another model of mobilisation, but it is an opportunity to start to publicly articulate why this could be necessary in the future and how it might develop. Yes, a public debate on conscription would be politically sensitive, but it is clear that the current approach is not working and that it is a critical national security risk, with the Army not meeting its recruitment targets for 14 years. Developing a new social contract will take time and a government willing to legislate in the face of public apathy or even antipathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it is an acknowledgement that defence spending will have to increase to keep the country and its people safe, as the only realistic mitigation measure against a more dangerous world. If this all sounds politically unappealing – or too costly, to NATO capitals – there is an easier and much cheaper solution: giving Ukraine what it needs to win.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;張劍虹：黎智英稱國安法後《蘋果》處「生死存亡之秋」、支持黃色經濟圈推撐小店計劃&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uBclhIs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（25日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第16日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。張表示，黎智英拒絕接納馮偉光建議在英文版加副刊文章，因英文版目的是引起外國關注及輿論，「如果加埋呢啲 feature（專題）落去，就會 dilute（淡化）咗成樣嘢。」張又指黎曾表示《國安法》實施後「香港同《蘋果日報》都係生死存亡之秋」，亦曾稱很多外國傳媒排隊訪問他，但強調「佢話佢唔怕嘅，佢會照講，講佢要講嘅嘢，包括要求美國制裁中國」。另外，張表示黎於2019年底指示推行「撐小店」計劃，讓他們免費在《蘋果》登廣告，並指「黃色經濟圈」對抗爭運動有好處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張稱黎拒在英文版加副刊文章會淡化引外國輿論的作用&quot;&gt;張稱黎拒在英文版加副刊文章：會淡化引外國輿論的作用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹作供時解釋《蘋果日報》網上英文版內容。他確認英文版不會出現關於中國的正面新聞，只會有負面新聞。張又解釋英文版的不同範疇，專題方面包括逆權報道、以及新疆集中營的調查報道。至於專欄方面，則包括不同社論，例如黎智英的「成敗樂一笑」、李怡及顏純鈎的專欄，同時亦會有英文作者所撰的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張表示，他及黎智英曾經建議一些英文寫手，最後由黎負責核准。黎亦表示，Mark Simon 及 Mark Clifford 會找人寫英文版專欄。不少由張等介紹的寫手曾寫過專欄，但同時亦有一些非他們介紹的寫手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張提到，英文版並沒有副刊內容如飲食及旅遊等。於2020年9月、《國安法》實施後，執行總編輯馮偉光曾向張表示，英文版內容種類太少，大多是「逆權、抗爭、制裁」這類型的文章。馮遂問「係咪可以加啲副刊類型嘅文章落去？」，即包括旅遊、飲食、文化等軟新聞（soft news）。張就此事向黎智英索取指示，但黎回應「唔好咁做」，並強調英文版目的是「希望用我哋揀選嘅一啲偏黃、支持《蘋果》嘅新聞，引起外國關注同輿論」，又指：「如果加埋呢啲 feature（專題）落去，就會 dilute（淡化）咗成樣嘢。」張把黎的訊息轉達馮。因此，英文版專題主要關於「香港逆權、中國打壓人權」等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑非社長作出編採決定-張報社擁有人有其個人立場&quot;&gt;官質疑非社長作出編採決定 張：報社擁有人有其個人立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，似乎所有的編採決定並非由張劍虹作出，而是需要向黎智英索取指示。張同意，並指因涉及英文版方向性的編採決定。李追問，一般報社也並非由社長作出編採決定？張解釋，以其理解各傳媒報刊都會有其編採政策，「好多時 owner（擁有人）有個人 style（風格）、有個人立場」；除非對方「好放手」，或者其股權透過基金持有，他完全不處理業務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱英文版新聞太少難吸引讀者-馮如美國制裁林鄭會即時加新聞&quot;&gt;黎稱英文版新聞太少難吸引讀者 馮：如美國制裁林鄭會即時加新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示英文版 WhatsApp 群組對話，黎智英於2020年8月8日、《國安法》實施後向張及馮發訊息，表示「劍虹，盧峯，我們新聞數目太少，沒有 critical mass（群聚效應）吸引讀者，應想想辦法增加。或可增加一些財經新聞？但時事新聞肯（定）要增加。謝謝。黎」。馮回應「明白，正逐步增加，有重大新聞如美國制裁林鄭會即時增加幾條」。而張則回應「老闆，明白。正在增加中，會加快速度。謝謝」。控方問及，為何需要在英文版中增加制裁的新聞，張解釋黎智英指示需要集中制裁、逆權及抗爭的新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱英文版需要集中於中國新聞&quot;&gt;黎稱英文版需要集中於中國新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示群組的其他訊息，黎智英於2020年8月26日向馮傳訊息，他轉發了一則新聞連結，題為〈共和黨稱拜登對伊朗及伊斯蘭國有好處，對中國而言很好〉（“Republicans say Biden ‘Good for Iran and ISIS. Great for China’”）。黎同時問，「盧峯，我們需要這類型與中國無關，但所有英國主流報章都有刊登的新聞嗎？我在考慮。（“Lo Fung, Do we need this kind of news that has nothing to do with China and all major English newspapers have published it? I wondered.”）」馮回應：「我嘗試包含一些國際新聞，因我們的讀者來自世界各地，他們或想知道多些全球主流新聞，尤其美國選舉等重要新聞。（“I am trying to include a few stories on international news, as our readers are from all parts of the world and they may want to know a bit about major news happening around the globe, especially important news like US election.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馮再回應：「作為成熟的新聞頻道，我認為我們需要覆蓋對讀者而言重要的新聞。提供更多種類內容。（“As a full fledge News channel, I think we need to have some coverage on news that’s important to readers. Give some more variety of content too.”）」黎卻表示：「我不認為需要這類型的新聞，因他們的本地新聞會覆蓋。我認為我們需要集中於中國新聞，並以此聞名，不要令其淡化。（“I don’t think this kind of news is needed since wherever they come their local news media should have covered it. I rather think that we should focus on Chinese news and be known for it without dilution.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馮其後表示「好的，會由今日起停止國際新聞（“Ok, will stop running international news from today”）」。張亦表示「收到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指黎認為國安法後香港及蘋果都處生死存亡之秋&quot;&gt;張指黎認為《國安法》後香港及蘋果都處「生死存亡之秋」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到，是否自2020年8月26日起，英文版沒有再覆蓋國際新聞，只是集中於中國新聞？張表示「相信係」，並指「黎生講到明唔可以有呢樣嘢（國際新聞），應該唔會再出，黎生睇英文版新聞睇得好緊㗎」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問黎「睇得好緊」的原因，張指黎心急想盡快推出英文版，是因成立《國安法》的時候，他冀影響到國際輿論，「希望外國可以關注香港情況做一啲嘢」，且「希望香港同《蘋果日報》都可以得到美國同其他西方國家嘅政治保護」。張又指：「何況《國安法》已經實施咗，黎生覺得香港同《蘋果日報》都係生死存亡之秋」，因此黎對英文版很著緊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方反對控方問黎智英想法-因張並非其肚子內的蟲&quot;&gt;辯方反對控方問黎智英想法 因張並非其「肚子內的蟲」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方資深大律師彭耀鴻就控方問題作出反對，因控方問及黎的想法，但張「並非黎智英肚子內的蟲（“not a worm in Mr Lai’s stomach”）」。法官杜麗冰認為，張相對熟悉黎，因此能夠作出判斷，並指可於盤問時再澄清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張黎稱受訪時會照說要求制裁佢話佢唔怕嘅講要講嘅嘢&quot;&gt;張：黎稱受訪時會照說要求制裁、「佢話佢唔怕嘅，講要講嘅嘢」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就張表示希望外國可以「做一啲嘢」，控方追問其意思，張解釋，黎稱希望外國能夠「對於中國採取敵對行動」，包括制裁。他表示整個5月氣氛緊張，尤其5月下旬人大會議訂立《國安法》後，當時黎稱要「一人一信」予時任美國總統。黎又在5、6月的飯盒會指「最近好忙」，因為很多外國傳媒排隊訪問他，而「佢話佢唔怕嘅，佢會照講，講佢要講嘅嘢，包括要求美國制裁中國」。黎曾提及覺得《國安法》「好嚴重」、「比佢預計更嚴重」，若真的實施的話，「香港經濟金融都冇㗎啦，《蘋果》都唔使旨意有得做」，因此他希望美國制裁中共。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張黎認為黃色經濟圈對抗爭有好處&quot;&gt;張：黎認為「黃色經濟圈」對抗爭有好處&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示4篇《蘋果》英文版報道，包括：於2020年7月14日刊登、由李平（楊清奇）所撰的〈Editorial: Who is Afraid of CCP Sanctions and Oppressions?（蘋論：中共的打壓與制裁不足畏）〉 ；於2020年7月18日刊登、由旅美作家「一劍飄塵」所撰的〈Will U.S. sanction Carrie Lam?（美國會制裁林鄭月娥嗎？）〉；於2020年8月28日刊登、由香港監察創辦人 Benedict Rogers 所撰的〈Aversion to Beijing’s bellicose diplomacy is escalating in Europe〉；以及於2021年1月14日刊登、由 Glacier Kwong 鄺頌晴所撰的〈Round-up of all opposition politicians the HK version of Kaohisung Incident〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張確認上述4篇報道均是按着黎智英的編採指示執行，因都想關於爭取國際支持及關注，並希望外國會對中共及香港官員採取制裁行動，對抗中共對香港的打壓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，控方展示第4篇文章的內容，當中提及「香港人應該一同貢獻以保護我們的公民社會，支持在囚者及『黃色經濟圈』（“Hong Kong people should work together to devote ourselves to protecting our civil society, support for prisoners and the ‘yellow economic circle’.”）」。控方問黎有否支持「黃色經濟圈」；張解釋，黎認為只要抗爭一直繼續存在，「黃色經濟圈」就需要存在，因它對整個抗爭運動有好處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張黎指示推行撐小店計劃讓他們免費登廣告&quot;&gt;張：黎指示推行「撐小店」計劃、讓他們免費登廣告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張補充，《蘋果》曾經做過「撐小店」的分類廣告計劃，即免費讓小店在《蘋果》刊登廣告一段時間。在被警方搜查過、屬於他的日記簿當中，有提及黎叫他向廣告部跟進「撐小店」事宜。黎於2019年底的廣告部飯盒會當中，指示同事做這方面的分類小廣告。因為當時抗爭運動熱烈，參與抗爭的香港人會以政治取向，揀選所光顧的店舖，因此形成「黃色經濟圈」，而他們不會光顧「藍店」。直至2020年初疫情開始，計劃需暫停，後來於年中恢復。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（25日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第16日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹作供。控方提到黎智英於2020年12月開始還柙，張表示於黎還柙第2、3日有探訪他，並向黎請示「《蘋果日報》點樣運作落去」。當時黎的指示為：「唔使怕，繼續做，繼續做落去，照原來咁做。」於是張繼續按原本方針經營《蘋果》，並把黎的指示轉達予其他高層，向各人表示：「黎生都仲係好有戰意，叫我哋唔使驚。」控方播放「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」片段，被問到是否感害怕，黎表示：「我不可以害怕，如果我害怕就不能再發言及行動」，「否則我會變得無用，我會寧願死去。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張黎稱不要付稿費予已流亡的投稿者免令人覺得資助&quot;&gt;張：黎稱不要付稿費予已流亡的投稿者、免令人覺得資助&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示張劍虹與楊清奇的 WhatsApp 對話，張於2020年8月3日向楊發訊息：「清奇，政府通緝多名海外人士，說他們違反國安法，如果他們來稿，我們也不方便付稿費。內容當然也按原定方針把關」；楊回覆「收到」。張解釋，事前曾經與黎智英通話，就流亡或被通緝人士向《蘋果》投稿事宜請示黎。黎表示可照刊登流亡或被通緝人士的投稿，但「如果唔想被上綱上線，可以唔好畀稿費佢哋，有個平台登佢哋嘅稿就可以」。張表示，黎覺得他們可以獲得「香港人同情」，亦可在外國為香港發聲，但「無謂畀人覺得《蘋果日報》畀佢哋一啲資助行為」，因此不給予稿費。張認為楊有依照指示，但不記得流亡人士有否繼續投稿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張稱曾介紹寫政壇權鬥的日本人撰稿&quot;&gt;張稱曾介紹寫政壇權鬥的日本人撰稿&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，楊於2020年9月15日向張發訊息：「社長，我已聯絡高橋，談好交稿、修改、稿酬事宜。」張表示高橋為日本人，認識黎智英並經常訪問他。高橋主要寫日本政壇的權鬥，其立場是「反政府」。由於張認為其立場亦適合《蘋果》，因此在未有請示黎之下，於9月中介紹他協助為論壇寫稿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張稱於黎智英還柙後前往探訪-黎唔使怕繼續做落去&quot;&gt;張稱於黎智英還柙後前往探訪 黎：「唔使怕，繼續做落去」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後，控方提到黎智英於2020年12月開始還柙，並問張劍虹有否去探訪。張表示於黎還柙第2、3日有探訪他，並向黎請示「《蘋果日報》點樣運作落去」。當時黎的指示為：「唔使怕，繼續做，繼續做落去，照原來咁做。」於是張繼續按着原本的方針經營《蘋果》，包括「繼續支持抗爭，希望外國西方國家繼續關注香港情況，提供援助」，並自己主持飯盒會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張向其他高層轉達黎生仲係好有戰意&quot;&gt;張向其他高層轉達：黎生仲係好有戰意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，英文版仍舊繼續按照原本的方針運作，而黎智英的對談直播（Live Chat）及專欄「成敗樂一笑」則停止。其後張把黎的指示轉達予《蘋果》的高層，包括各部門的副總編輯及主管。張向各人表示：「黎生都仲係好有戰意，叫我哋唔使驚。」而各部門的人亦有依照指示繼續運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指自己還柙後沒有再給予指示&quot;&gt;張指自己還柙後沒有再給予指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，張確認自己於2021年6月17日被捕，翌日（18日）起還柙。他確認直至2021年6月30日，自己仍然為壹傳媒集團的行政總裁；直至2021年6月24日，他仍然是3間公司的董事。他表示自還柙後，自己沒有再向《蘋果》高層發出指示。他並不清楚公司事務由誰人接手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎於直播稱我不可以害怕否則會變得無用寧願死去&quot;&gt;黎於直播稱：我不可以害怕，否則會變得無用，寧願死去&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播放兩節「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」片段，分別是2020年7月9日及30日，各時長17及35分鐘。首片段開始時，黎表示希望令更多人關注英文版《蘋果》，然後回答觀眾問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到《國安法》對香港的影響，黎表示《國安法》是香港的「喪鐘（Death Knell）」，在港從商人士會失去保護及自由，最後導致經濟衰落及衍生失業問題。黎被問到是否感到害怕，他表示「我不可以害怕，如果我害怕就不能再發言及行動」，「否則我會變得無用，我會寧願死去。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於《國安法》對香港的風險，黎表示現時很多人打算移民，但自己卻沒有打算移民，若然情況變壞，妻兒可能會離開，而自己則留下來。不過沒有家人支持，他很難繼續前進。他又指，香港人追求自由的價值，因為經歷過英國殖民時代。黎最後強調，市民訂閱英文版能夠對傳媒起保護作用。最後有觀眾問黎早餐吃了甚麼食物，在庭上的黎妻聞後發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示文章，顯示事後《蘋果》轉載上述片段，標題為〈黎智英twitter直播精華 聲言毋懼國安法繼續留港抗爭〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎可能親中陣營見民主派初選成功感擔心&quot;&gt;黎：可能親中陣營見民主派初選成功感擔心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第二段片段，黎智英與壹傳媒獨立非執行董事 Mark Clifford 和美國在台協會前主席 Raymond Burghardt 對話。他們談及即將進行的立法會選舉，會否如期舉行。黎表示，有很多國家在疫情下仍然進行選舉，可能是親中陣營見民主派初選成功而感擔心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明續審，控方將就片段作出提問。法官問及控方何時會完成張的主問，控方指將於本周完結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s weaponization of trade is at the core of its building of an illiberal order. The Biden administration will need to think outside the box in deterring this practice.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is rampant speculation about whether Chinese president Xi Jinping will take military action against Taiwan by 2027, there is 100 percent certainty he will use economic coercion against unsuspecting governments and private companies. Over the past 15 years, China has used economic coercion against 18 countries and over 400 companies, causing tens of billions of dollars in damage, according to a unique data set created at CSIS. This practice, in particular, has heightened under Xi. If Beijing does not like a neighbor’s statement about Taiwan or Xinjiang or wants to press on a territorial dispute, it will leverage its vast market to intimidate and punish. These actions are generally unannounced and not based in any universal trade rule or domestic law. And this bullying, in China’s eyes, has worked. Targeted countries and firms self-censor on issues like Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang for fear of economic retaliation — threats which Beijing bandies about regularly like a mafia boss. As the Chinese ambassador to New Zealand noted, “An economic relationship in which China buys nearly a third of the country’s exports shouldn’t be taken for granted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s weaponization of trade is at the core of its building of an illiberal order. The Biden administration will need to think outside the box in deterring this practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent case is the Xi regime’s enacting of controls on exports of gallium and germanium — two high-tech metals used for production of everything from semiconductor chips to electric vehicles to satellites. China accounts for almost 100 percent of the world’s production of gallium and almost 70 percent of the world’s refinery production of germanium. Gallium is a by-product of bauxite and zinc ores for which there is no substitute, and germanium is a metal used in the production of fiber optics, for which there are substitute materials like silicon, but they come at the expense of performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world’s response to China’s weaponization of trade, however, has been to play defense. That is, countries respond by reducing supply chain dependence on China and finding alternative markets — what the Biden administration calls “de-risking.” Regarding gallium and germanium, there are efforts to build resilient supply chains among lower-volume producers, including the United States, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Canada, and Belgium, to blunt the impact of China’s squeeze, even at higher costs. In another case, the United States and Europe have sought to mitigate the impact of China’s sanctions on Lithuania (for having a Taiwan representative office) through directing investment funds to the country, expanding market access for Lithuanian exports, and political support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this strategy is that countries cannot stop a bully only by playing defense. “De-risking” tries to lessen the pain inflicted by economic coercion in the moment but does nothing to stop future acts preemptively. The best way to do this in 2024 is to make Beijing understand that it will feel pain if it tries to weaponize trade against others such that it will be deterred. Like-minded countries will need to form a collective economic deterrence pact to promise counter-coercion to end further economic bullying by Xi Jinping. And they have the capabilities to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, the G7 countries plus Australia export 395 items with a trade value of over $37 billion to China, upon which Beijing is more than 70 percent dependent as a percentage of its total trade in those goods, and 153 items valued at $7.5 billion that China is over 90 percent dependent on (2022 figures), according to a unique data set compiled at CSIS. Moreover, the second- and third-largest exporters of these high-dependence goods are often like-minded partners. For example, to deter further Chinese economic coercion, Japan and the United States could threaten to curtail the export of silver powder (used for solar panel production) to China, where the two compose over 97 percent of China’s global supply. Australia and Canada could threaten action on exports of nickel powders (used for production of rechargeable batteries), where the two make up almost 80 percent of China’s global supply. Further, Japan and Germany could promise to control alloyed steel ingots to China (used for shipbuilding), as the two countries account for 82 percent of China’s imported supplies and China has no alternative domestic supply. The United States, Canada, France, and Italy could even leverage luxury goods like lobster and champagne, where the four make up nearly 90–100 percent of China’s imports. These trade disruptions would impose costs on China absent large domestic production sources for these high-dependence items. Countries feel they must kowtow to China because of its massive market, but they have enough leverage as a group to shape Beijing’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key, of course, is herding enough partners for a commitment that credibly signals the threat of counter-coercion to China. This will not be easy. Free riding is likely as companies may not want to play ball with a government economic deterrence strategy and others might seek opportunistic backfilling of the Chinese market. But countries should be motivated to join the cause because (1) they no longer want to live under the eternal, brooding shadow of China’s economic predation and (2) they know they are better off dealing with China as a group than alone. G7 leaders appear to have gotten this message in Hiroshima, Japan, in May 2023 with their collective statements about organizing to counter Chinese economic coercion. Meeting in the city of one of China’s most recent targets, Vilnius, Lithuania, in July, NATO leaders — including Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand as part of the new “Asia-Pacific 4” appendage — made similar statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s predatory trade actions constitute a serious threat to the global order. Extreme times call for extreme measures. The purpose of a collective economic deterrence pact is not to burn down the liberal trading order through inciting trade wars but to try to salvage it from economic predation by one of its largest players. If China does not bully, then the threat of counter-coercion will never need to be exercised. Without a willingness to fight fire with fire, however, countries will forever be victimized by China’s weaponization of trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite the broad budget cuts elsewhere, Chinese government spending for the technology sector is skyrocketing, especially in the semiconductor sector, where U.S. export controls are most painful and threatening.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year 2023 brought technological competition between the United States and China to its most intense level yet. Will 2024 bring more of the same? Probably. There is little indication that China’s views, goals, or actions will change much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with China’s views. In September 2023, the head of China’s Ministry of State Security, Chen Yixin, published an article describing China’s strategic thinking on technology and national security. In it, Chen writes, “The most important competition is the increasingly fierce competition between great powers in cyberspace. . . . The most prominent [Chinese] shortcoming is that key and core technologies are controlled by others.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of Chen’s essay, “cyberspace” refers not only to cyberattacks and espionage but also to the broader industrial landscape of digital technology with all of its economic and national security implications. The “key and core technologies” are dozens of Chinese dependencies on critical foreign technologies identified by the Chinese government, seven of which directly relate to the semiconductor industry. The “others” Chen refers to are, of course, the United States and its allies, who in recent years have sought to restrict China’s access to certain advanced technologies through export controls, especially in semiconductors and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A straightforward interpretation of Chen’s remarks is that he views technology as the most important zone of U.S.-China competition. Given Chen’s position as the head of China’s most important intelligence organization and that his speech was drawing heavily from Chinese president Xi Jinping’s latest ideological treatise, it is reasonable to assume his speech reflects the broadly shared views of China’s most senior leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings us to China’s goals. China’s most recent five-year economic plan stated China would “make technological self-sufficiency a strategic pillar of national development,” meaning it wants to free itself from foreign technological import dependencies. Many of Xi’s recent speeches have reiterated this goal, and the Chinese government is using both carrots and sticks to decouple Chinese firms from Western technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to see why China would put technology atop its priority list. Technological advancement is among the most important inputs to the other major sources of national power, including economic and military power. In the comparison between the U.S. and Chinese economies, the simplest difference is that China has a population roughly four times larger, but the United States generates roughly six times the amount of economic output per person. The United States’ much higher economic productivity is largely due to its much higher level of technology across many more sectors of its economy. If China were to match the United States in technological sophistication, innovation, and widespread adoption, then China’s economic advantage over the United States might resemble its population advantage, meaning China’s economy would be four times larger than that of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In assessing Chinese strategic priorities, actions speak louder than words, and China’s actions provide considerable evidence that it views technological competition with the United States as its top priority. In the wake of China’s disastrous zero-Covid policy, property market crisis, and slowed economic growth, China’s local governments are facing a debt crisis so severe that some government agencies are unable to pay their employees’ salaries on time. Under such circumstances, China might have understandably cut back its investment in technological self-sufficiency. Instead, it did the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the broad budget cuts elsewhere, Chinese government spending for the technology sector is skyrocketing, especially in the semiconductor sector, where U.S. export controls are most painful and threatening. In 2018, New York Times columnist Li Yuan described the first round of semiconductor export controls under U.S. president Donald Trump’s administration as China’s “Sputnik moment,” making a comparison to the Soviet Union’s 1957 satellite launch, which led the United States to establish the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and dramatically increase spending on science and technology. Yuan’s comparison was apt. According to data collected by Chinese research firm JW Insights, China’s various local governments collectively spent nearly $65 billion in both 2021 and 2022 to support China’s semiconductor industry. If true, that amount would be more than two and a half times what the United States spends on NASA each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, China not only increased its already massive subsidies but also announced another $41 billion government-backed semiconductor investment fund. Amid China’s record youth unemployment, when many in China are calling for economic stimulus, Xi is advising China’s youth to “eat bitterness,” an idiom that means to suffer without complaining. Rapidly breaking free from dependence on foreign technology is evidently a much higher priority than reinvigorating economic growth or easing economic pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the future of the U.S.-China relationship depends upon the United States, not just China. However, U.S. officials largely agree with China about the importance of technology in the U.S.-China rivalry. In October 2022, U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken gave a speech in which he said, “We are at an inflection point. The post-Cold War world has come to an end, and there is intense competition underway to shape what comes next. And at the heart of that competition is technology.” More recently, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan’s essay in Foreign Affairs made similar points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States has the edge in its current technological level, China believes its own advantages may matter more. Xi often touts China’s “remarkable institutional superiority” and “administrative efficiency.” Recent Chinese failures, such as the zero-Covid policy, call such advantages into question, but they also highlight just how stubborn the Chinese leadership can be. In technology competition, China’s strategic focus, extraordinary funding, and stubbornness of policy direction is real and should not be underestimated. The Chinese government’s cheering of a new Huawei smartphone in mid-2023 also shows that it is now willing to openly defy U.S. law and export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of financial resources, the CHIPS for America fund, one of the largest U.S. industrial policy investments in recent memory, allocated more than $50 billion in semiconductor industry support, but that was spread over a five-year period. It is vastly less than China is spending each year for its own semiconductor industry. Even amid such incredible budgets, comparatively paltry sums needed for core elements of the overall strategy go ignored. As just one example, technology export controls are a key element of the strategy for the administration of U.S. president Joe Biden and a key source of Chinese anxiety. However, the budget for the U.S. Department of Commerce bureau charged with effectively designing, administering, and enforcing them has actually declined in inflation-adjusted terms. Thankfully, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has recently started arguing for the need to rectify this policy incoherence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, there is little to suggest the overall picture will change much in 2024, especially on the Chinese side. Tactics may change, perhaps with a new emphasis on import restrictions, but both the United States and China are likely to continue to desire every advantage in their deepening technological competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What might make a difference, though, is an improvement in the United States’ ability to align its many policy choices in pursuit of those desires, including choices that affect the government’s capacity to realistically execute its own policies. That will require policymakers to maintain focus not only on high-profile and politically charged issues but also on the comparatively banal steps needed to significantly improve U.S. government speed and capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the right views and goals matters, but ensuring the U.S. government can effectively monitor and analyze key technology developments, as well as design and execute relevant policies, matters just as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Although few multinational companies (MNCs) are outright abandoning China, some are selling off some of their China-based assets and diversifying their places of production and supply chains, and few MNCs are investing in China for the first time.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is rarely, if ever, a consensus about the state of China’s economy. To some extent, this is the product of ambiguous data. Few trust Chinese official economic growth data, and there is no agreement on what might serve as a suitable proxy to evaluate the economy’s performance. Even if official data were more reliable, the country’s massive size and internal variation create additional opportunities for disagreement. Despite widespread pessimism, inside and outside of China, about the trajectory of the economy, significant differences still persist. Although China is less transparent than ever, a prominent source of disagreement are the initial positions of observers, who inevitably emphasize different elements of the economy. Their contrasting analyses translate into alternative policy implications for the United States and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly&quot;&gt;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the past 30 years, evaluations of China’s economy — both inside and outside the country — were divided into three camps, what I’ve previously called “the good, the bad, and the ugly,” inspired by the title of the famous 1966 movie of this name. The “good” perspective has painted a positive picture of rapid growth built on a gradualist approach to guide the economy through multiple transitions — from plan to market, rural to urban, agriculture to industry and services, and investment-led to consumption. In this story, China’s growth has generated opportunities for other countries in what Beijing would likely call a “win-win outcome.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “bad” perspective has highlighted a highly inefficient financial system, which has taken savings from households and disproportionately funneled capital to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and questionable state-led pet projects, creating a buildup of debt that would result in either a gradual sclerosis and anemic growth or a massive financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those holding the “ugly” view have been highly worried about China’s economic trajectory, not because of immovable structural issues such as debt, but because of poor policy choices by China’s leadership that have largely favored expanding state control over supporting market mechanisms. From this perspective, reversing course, in the direction of liberalization, could provide a foundation for greater productivity and continued long-term growth, even if not at the rate of earlier years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-bad-and-the-ugly&quot;&gt;The Bad and the Ugly&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last five years there has been a fundamental reordering of perspectives. There is almost no one, inside or outside of China, holding up the “good” banner any longer. That is because under the leadership of Xi Jinping, China has largely backtracked on the gradualist “reform and opening” strategy that had yielded success for so long. Internationally, China’s global footprint has grown dramatically, and domestically, the services sector and consumption are larger parts of the economy; but broader liberalization of economic activity and an educed role for the state are no longer at the center of the agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the gravity of opinion has shifted in a far more pessimistic direction. A few, consistent with the bad perspective, focus on one or another structural issue, such as debt or demography, or a combination of them. More often, the bad and ugly perspectives are merging, with a criticism of Xi’s highly statist approach and specific policy measures, which observers believe are reducing productivity and undermining China’s growth prospects. Xi may have tinkered with liberalizing reforms early in his tenure, but on the whole he has reversed course across the board. Whenever given a choice between control and markets, Xi has invariably almost always chosen the former. Hence, state intervention to halt the stock market’s fall, a draconian zero-Covid policy, the crackdown on private tech firms, the erosion of independent corporate governance institutions within companies, an emphasis of inequality over growth, and the pursuit of technological independence over integrating into global supply chains. Under Xi, almost every policy now is framed in terms of security: energy security, food security, financial security, technology security, health security and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concerns of economists draw heavily on the deep pessimism and, in some cases, outright sense of despondence widespread among China’s broader populace and its business community. Private conversations and interviews yield a wave of criticism of the political and policy environment and the real estate crisis and fall in home values, as well as the fears about possible war and isolation due to increased tensions with the United States. These concerns add up to a profound sense of uncertainty about the future and a loss of confidence in China’s overall direction. This has translated economically into stagnant consumer demand and restrained investment by business, meaning fewer new jobs and slower economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global business community is particularly worried about U.S.-China security tensions, but it shares the same worries about China’s overall policy direction. Although few multinational companies (MNCs) are outright abandoning China, some are selling off some of their China-based assets and diversifying their places of production and supply chains, and few MNCs are investing in China for the first time. Excitement about China has waned among foreign private equity firms because of the uncertain prospect that the Chinese companies in which they invest will be able to go public. Hedge funds and other institutional investors are also worried about short- and long-term returns, viewing other options as less risky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-mean&quot;&gt;The Mean&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the broader pessimistic shift, there is one perspective that is more sanguine about China’s current economic prospects. Techno-nationalists, who believe a country’s economic and military power comes primarily through its ability to dominate advanced technologies, see Chinese industrial policy and all of its tools as a strength of its system. Not only is this the view of Xi and his inner circle, some techno-nationalists in the United States and elsewhere conclude that China has made enormous technological strides to overtake the West in critical sectors and become a peer in others. They point to Chinese successes in telecom equipment, high-speed rail, electric vehicles, solar, wind, and AI as evidence of China’s growing strength. And they discount the inefficiencies of China’s economy by arguing that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has unlimited financial resources, the political power to dictate domestic company behavior and consumer choices, and a large enough domestic market and other resources to withstand and overcome Western restrictions and pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This optimistic view of China’s techno-nationalist approach is challenged by those who point to the very mixed record of Chinese industrial policy initiatives and China’s continued technological dependence on others. Rather than a well-oiled machine, they see mounting internal tensions and policymaking dysfunction that will mean a continued sizeable gap between China’s technology policy ambitions and actual commercial outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-implications-for-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Policy Implications for the United States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These contrasting views of China’s economic trajectory come with quite different policy prescriptions for the United States and other advanced market economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although now out of favor, if China were still pursuing, or would return to, a strategy of reduced state intervention at home and greater liberalization internationally, in line with the good perspective, the appropriate response from the United States and others would be an approach of patient integration. Akin to the long-term engagement strategy, the United States would rely on a web of multilateral institutions (such as the World Trade Organization), regional arrangements (such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP), and bilateral agreements to encourage China to move in a market-oriented direction and penalize it in the specific instances where it does not meet its commitments. Given how far China has deviated from this path, the likelihood of restoring a consensus in Washington in favor of such an approach is extremely low. Those hoping for such a return to a “reform and opening” strategy could help identify a series of steps China would need to take to prove its intentions to domestic and international audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those in the bad and ugly camps, which are now in ascendance, have less faith that China under Xi will accept any significant liberalization of its economy and are concerned about the effect of China’s non-market practices on the rest of the world’s economy as well as the national security and human rights risks that extensive connectivity may pose to the United States and its allies. Hence, they council a combination of continuing to take advantage of continuing commercial opportunities, blunting the impact of China’s economic distortions and national security vulnerabilities, and strengthening the United States’ own economic foundations and the international rules-based order. This encapsulates the analysis and approach of the Biden administration, with its emphasis on de-risking (export controls, investment screening, supply chain diversification, etc.), promoting the reinvigoration of manufacturing and technology innovation at home, and developing a bilateral agenda on reducing barriers to China’s market, trying to constrain Chinese industrial policy, and seeking to cooperate in areas of common interest, including public health and climate change. A central underlying principle of this approach is the need to coordinate and align policies with like-minded countries to ensure that efforts at de-risking are effective and do not isolate the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those in the “mean” camp, who are most impressed by China’s industrial policy prowess but also deeply worried about its effect on the United States and global economy, are far more skeptical that the United States can effectively calibrate a relationship with China in a way that aligns with American national interests. They point to the expansion of China’s manufacturing in emerging industries and continuing large trade surplus with the United States and others. As a result, they are in favor of outright decoupling and trying to isolate China, while at the same time pushing the United States to develop its own comprehensive industrial policy to rebuild its manufacturing capacity and dominate the technologies of the future. This perspective is reflected in the analysis of former U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer, and in a bipartisan report issued in late 2023 by the U.S. House of Representatives’ Select Committee on the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If past is prologue, the various schools of thought about China’s economy will continue to contend with each other without an ultimate resolution to their disagreement. But the debate is likely to become even more contentious in 2024, in part because China’s economy is likely to rebound over the course of the year and in part because of the 2024 U.S. election season. Rather than be forlorn over a potentially heated yet inconclusive period of attacks and counterattacks, Washington (and other Western capitals) could use this year as a chance to finally push the contending views to not talk past each other and clearly evaluate their relative merits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so, analysts should collectively answer three interrelated questions. First, what are the strengths and weaknesses of China’s economy and how should credit and blame be apportioned? For example, where there are successes (such as in mobile phones and electric vehicles), are these the result of wise industrial policies or market liberalization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, how does China’s economic behavior and performance affect the United States and the rest of the world? The policy community still does not have sufficient understanding of the overall effect on the American economy, in part because there is not agreement about which metrics should be used or which sources of data are reliable. At the same time, analysts and policymakers need to carry out a comprehensive discussion of the risks and benefits of extensive commercial ties and interdependence for the United States’ national security. The risks are increasingly obvious, but the benefits of connectivity — for improving American innovation, creating lines of communication, and increasing the costs of Chinese aggression — deserve renewed evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having analyzed China’s economy and the effects on the United States, Washington needs to answer one final question: What are the costs and benefits of the de-risking approach the Biden administration has taken over the past few years, and what are the potential results of the alternative strategies of a return to engagement or a comprehensive strategy aimed at decoupling? To date, no overall assessment has been done of what the current approach has achieved and whether it makes sense to continue forward or move in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although an intense debate on China during an election year could produce a substantial amount of heat, if carried out thoughtfully, it could produce much-needed light as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China is rapidly developing a robust defense industrial base to deter, fight, and win a war against the United States.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is rapidly developing a robust defense industrial base to deter, fight, and win a war against the United States. As secretary of the U.S. Air Force Frank Kendall III remarked in 2023, “China is preparing for a war and specifically for a war with the United States.” While China is ramping up its industrial base, however, the U.S. defense industrial base lacks the surge capacity and flexibility to meet U.S. military needs. Unless there are urgent changes, the United States risks weakening deterrence and undermining its warfighting capabilities against China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Nobel Prize–winning economist Thomas Schelling wrote, effective deterrence is a function of both the intentions and capabilities of the deterrer. For the United States, this means building sufficient military capabilities to deter such actions as a Chinese invasion of Taiwan as well as signaling U.S. resolve to use those capabilities if necessary. An important aspect of military capabilities is a country’s defense industrial base, which includes the set of companies involved in the research, design, development, production, delivery, and maintenance of weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, China has ramped up its defense industrial base in several ways. One is an improvement in the process of how China researches, develops, and produces advanced weapons systems. Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment William LaPlante called China “really impressive” in discussing China’s defense industrial base at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He also remarked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They’ve developed . . . really good high-end capability in numbers. So they’ve done the development and the development has been pretty continuous and not just one thing. They place multiple bets. We don’t do that. . . . We very rarely will place multiple bets and . . . [have] three different development activities going on. We used to do that. We don’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These efforts have improved Chinese air, land, naval, space, and cyber capabilities. For example, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is developing and producing a significant number of medium- and long-range missiles that can strike U.S. and allied land, air, and sea bases across the Indo-Pacific region. The PLA is also constructing and deploying integrated air defense systems to challenge U.S. forces attempting to operate near such areas as the Taiwan Strait. China now boasts three of the world’s 10 largest defense companies. Aviation Industry Corporation of China, China North Industries Group Corporation Limited, and China South Industries Group Corporation now rival such U.S. behemoths as RTX (formerly Raytheon), Northrup Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese capabilities are particularly robust in shipbuilding. China’s ability to rapidly build large numbers of ships represents a strategic advantage in a prolonged war. China is now the world’s largest shipbuilder. It has a shipbuilding capacity that is over 230 times greater than the United States. According to Carlos Del Toro, secretary of the Navy, one of China’s shipyards has more capacity than all U.S. shipyards combined. “That presents a real threat,” Del Toro acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these efforts are impressive, China still faces challenges. For example, the Chinese defense industry relies on foreign parts in several areas, such as engines and engine parts for diesel submarines and advanced aircraft. In addition, China struggles in such areas as designing specialized sound-absorbing coatings, dealing with vibration suppression issues created by steam turbines, and decreasing the sonar signature of its hull designs. Finally, China’s defense industrial base — and the Chinese Communist Party and PLA more broadly — suffer from extensive graft and corruption, which likely affects the quality of military systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, China is getting better. But the United States is lagging in several areas of its defense industrial base, weakening the prospect of deterrence and warfighting. For instance, the United States faces a serious shortfall of munitions — especially long-range precision munitions — and other weapons systems for a protracted war in such areas as the Indo-Pacific. In addition, Congress has dragged its feet in fixing contracting problems, such as multiyear procurement. Supply chain challenges remain serious, including an insufficient supply of solid rocket motors, ball bearings, microelectronics, and seekers for munitions. Today’s workforce is also inadequate to meet the demands of the defense industrial base, and the U.S. labor market struggles to provide enough workers with the right skills to meet defense demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, all is not lost. Far from it. The United States has made progress in some areas of the industrial base. For example, the Department of Defense has ramped up production lines for some weapons systems, such as 155-millimeter rounds, Stinger air defense systems, the Javelin anti-tank weapons system, and Patriot Advanced Capability–3 (PAC-3) air defense systems. In addition, the U.S. private sector is the most innovative in the world, and the United States has a strong track record of eventually ramping up its defense industrial base during periods of crisis, such as World War II, the Korean War, and the buildup under President Ronald Reagan at the height of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the United States needs to take several steps to revitalize its defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the Department of Defense and Congress need to expand the use of multiyear contracts to create sustained demand signals that will promote investment in the industrial base. Multiyear contracts have typically been reserved for only the most expensive acquisition platforms and systems, such as large navy ships. Yet multiyear procurement is important for munitions critical for deterrence and warfighting in the Indo-Pacific, such as the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile ( JASSM), PAC-3, Standard Missile–6 (SM-6), and AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Department of Defense and Congress should allocate additional funding for contracts and other incentives, such as tax incentives, regulatory relief, and long-term contracts, to build and maintain spare production capacity. This funding can be used to modernize and expand facilities and develop flexible production. The Department of Defense maintains stockpiles of key munitions, minerals, chemicals, technology, and medical supplies, but it needs to better manage inventory and stockpile planning to decrease near-term risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the United States needs to diversify the supplier base for the defense industry and invest in new production methods. The Department of Defense should look for opportunities to assist companies with upskilling and reskilling workers by offering incentives, such as expanding investments in the Manufacturing Innovation Institutes and in programs designed to support the talent necessary for defense-related manufacturing and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These steps are important to strengthen the U.S. defense industrial base to deter China and prepare for contingencies in case deterrence fails. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in his victory speech in December 1940, one year before the attack on Pearl Harbor, implored the nation to revitalize its defense industry. It is a message that is just as relevant today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We must be the great arsenal of democracy. For us this is an emergency as serious as war itself. We must apply ourselves to our task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show were we at war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s space capabilities are rapidly growing in quantity and quality, accelerated by clear political will, government prioritization, and large state and private investments.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is intent on surpassing the United States in space. President Xi Jinping has articulated a “space dream” for China to be the leading space power by 2049. While much has been made about the space developments by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), less attention has been paid to China’s commercial space activities. This new dimension of strategic competition will challenge the United States diplomatically, economically, technologically, and militarily, and is one to watch in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s space capabilities are rapidly growing in quantity and quality, accelerated by clear political will, government prioritization, and large state and private investments. Aerospace was designated a top priority in Beijing’s Made in China 2025 strategic initiative, aimed at achieving technological breakthroughs and boosting its innovation base. China broke its launch record in 2023 and has over 800 operational satellites in orbit, marking one of the swiftest climbs in the history of any modern space program. China is now second only to the United States in its total number of in-orbit satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, China’s commercial space sector has flourished, enabled by policy changes and fueled by private and state investments. In 2014, the Chinese government modified a restrictive policy to open select space sectors to private investment. According to a 2021 European market assessment, China is now leading the world in terms of number of commercial space companies established, and it has surpassed all but the United States in the number of space startups receiving funding. Further, according to a 2023 U.S. space investment report, China is second to the United States in space companies receiving private capital, drawing 28 percent of cumulative private market equity investment since 2014 (compared to 48 percent for U.S. companies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year 2023 was a breakthrough for China’s commercial space launch activities. In April 2023, its first commercial space launch occurred with the Tianlong-2 medium launch vehicle built by Beijing Tianbing Technology, also known as Space Pioneer. In July 2023, another private Chinese company, LandSpace, launched the world’s first methane-liquid oxygen rocket, significant in its increased performance, efficiency, and handling. No less than seven Chinese commercial companies conducted or were planning to conduct space launches in 2023, with the pace expected to pick up in 2024. Beijing is expanding its space launch sites to accommodate this commercial growth, including plans to further develop the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center on Hainan island as a commercial spaceport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese commercial space companies are progressing in other areas as well. In a 2021 presentation from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, China was assessed as the global leader in three of nine categories of commercial space-based imagery capabilities, matching U.S. commercial providers, which maintained the lead in only three categories. Chinese entities have plans to rival U.S. commercial low Earth orbit (LEO) broadband constellations. A 13,000-satellite network (GuoWang) would be the country’s answer to SpaceX’s Starlink, with large deployments anticipated to start in 2024. Another 12,000-satellite constellation (G60 Starlink) is also in the works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, as China pursues the same economic, security, and prestige benefits that other space powers have long enjoyed, it will be competing globally with the United States across these areas for influence, market share, and international norm setting. If the United States does not win this competition, there are both economic and national security consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a play from its 5G playbook, such space-based information, communications, and terrestrial infrastructure are natural offerings in Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative but come at a price. The proliferation of Chinese LEO broadband services could boost Beijing’s presence in foreign terrestrial networks, providing it with greater control over international data flows, allowing it to spread techno-authoritarian norms, and granting it extensive intelligence and coercive powers. Chinese satellite imagery companies could provide imagery of U.S. and partner forces to those seeking to harm U.S. interests. A prime example is Spacety China, a commercial company sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in early 2023 for selling imagery collected over Ukraine to enable Wagner Group combat operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could question whether these activities are truly commercial. In many cases, these commercial entities maintain ties to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) as subsidiaries or spin-offs, receive top-down support from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and enjoy large tracts of funding, municipal government support, and regulatory leeway. They offer a pathway for innovation and technological advancement outside of China’s SOEs and a way to reduce reliance on international companies or suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the CCP has made clear that technological advancements made by civil and commercial entities must also aid the military. Beijing’s military-civilian fusion (MCF) policy facilitates the transfer of technology and investments from the commercial sector to the military. Its 2017 National Intelligence Law requires that “any organization or citizen shall support, assist, and cooperate with state intelligence work” and keep the work a secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does the United States compete? It starts with taking a more strategic view of the commercial space sector. U.S. industry still leads in advanced space technology and private capital, though that lead is eroding. A strong space industrial base, deep bench of technical talent, and vibrant innovation ecosystem comprised of space start-ups and traditional aerospace companies with diversified revenue bases are in the nation’s economic and security interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the approach to space commerce and space diplomacy will need to evolve. Space capabilities are a form of soft power. Allies and partners are expanding their space programs and budgets, creating greater opportunities for closer cooperation, from Australia and the United Kingdom to Japan, South Korea, and India, as well as partners in the Middle East and Latin America. U.S. commercial space capabilities are a tool in the international cooperation tool kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, with the rise of China’s space industry and global diffusion of space technology and capital, international partners have an array of options. As a matter of U.S. policy and economics, it is far preferred that U.S. space entities be their partner of choice, not Chinese ones. But U.S. export policies must be modernized to enable such cooperation on space technology, which has long been subject to the same constraints as missile and munitions technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, maintaining U.S. technological leadership means not just preventing the transfer of technology to the PRC but also setting the conditions for the U.S. commercial space sector to prosper and stay ahead of the competition. The year 2024 extends the period of rapid technological change, with the private sector leading in many areas of technological innovation. The government should seek greater adoption and integration of commercial technologies to support mission needs, taking advantage of their speed and agility and the private capital being invested in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s commercial space sector is just getting started. There is no time to waste to position the U.S. space industry in the most competitive position possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To demonstrate resolve, the United States must rely on both military and political tools. . . . Reduced reliance on nuclear weapons could signal that U.S. leadership lacks the stomach to uphold security commitments.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 bipartisan Strategic Posture Commission calls for a change to the United States’ nuclear deterrence policy, concluding “the fundamentals of America’s deterrence strategy remain sound, but the application of that strategy must change to address the 2027–2035 threat environment.” China’s nuclear buildup over the past decade was one of the drivers of the commission’s conclusion that the United States needs to make “adjustments” in U.S. nuclear capabilities to effectively deter Beijing. To be sure, capabilities are a crucial part of a deterrence strategy. But an equally important tool is the credibility of U.S. commitments. The United States needs to ensure demonstrating resolve is part of any deterrence strategy in the face of a determined and patient adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, China has significantly expanded its strategic capabilities. The Department of Defense’s 2023 China military power report concluded, “Compared to the PLA’s [People’s Liberation Army] nuclear modernization efforts a decade ago, current efforts dwarf previous attempts in both scale and complexity.” Additionally, Chinese president Xi Jinping has ordered the military to prepare for an invasion of Taiwan by 2027, though Chinese leadership has since denied this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence is a combination of capabilities, credibility, and communication. Successful deterrence requires understanding what an adversary values most and holding it at risk in order to impose an unacceptable cost. China’s nuclear expansion presents a new set of deterrence challenges in regard to targeting, posture, and allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Posture Commission recommends “holding at risk key elements of their [Chinese and Russian] leadership, the security structure maintaining the leadership in power, their nuclear and conventional forces, and their war supporting industry.” Such action may require expanding or changing the makeup of the U.S. arsenal. Some experts, however, have argued that the United States simply needs the ability to “inflict catastrophic damage against both China and Russia.” On the surface, this approach would seem to lack the tailoring necessary for effective deterrence and assumes a one-size-fits-all approach. For any targeting strategy, improved understanding of what adversaries value will be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration under U.S. president Joe Biden has yet to clarify a strategy for deterring two peer competitors, including China. There are at least two important points of debate about such a strategy, as captured in a recent CSIS report. The first point of debate is about the nuclear force posture and the required mix of capabilities. Some experts argue the United States will need to expand its nuclear arsenal, such as by uploading warheads, but will not need to match Russia and China in combined numbers. Others suggest the United States should shift investment away from nuclear weapons toward advanced conventional weapons and new technologies while also strengthening resilience in nuclear command and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second area of debate is how to extend deterrence and assure U.S. allies. One side of the debate focuses on the value of capabilities, such as a new sea-launched cruise missile, in demonstrating commitment to allies, deterring regional aggression, and buttressing existing conventional capabilities. Others argue that allies should take on greater responsibility for their own security but through close consultation and communication with the United States, and that any U.S. deployments could provoke escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to see these debates as a binary between more or less capabilities misses important nuance about the political motives behind a deterrence strategy. Specifically, the debates miss a key question for U.S. political and military leaders: Does the United States have the resolve to defend its interests and allies? U.S. resolve has come into question in recent years following the failure to respond to Syrian chemical weapons attacks, the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and ongoing domestic debates about military aid to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resolve is about both stakes and stomach. Seemingly, the stakes in a Taiwan crisis, for example, are greater for China than for the United States, just as they appear to be for Russia in the current war in Ukraine. At the same time, the consequences for U.S. global leadership and allies’ confidence in U.S. security guarantees hinge on the U.S. response to an attack on an ally or partner. But even in scenarios where the stakes are evenly matched, there is a question of whether or not the U.S. public has the stomach to commit to military intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate resolve, the United States must rely on both military and political tools. The afore-mentioned debate about the right mix of capabilities must account for how allies and adversaries alike could perceive a shift to conventional forces. Reduced reliance on nuclear weapons could signal that U.S. leadership lacks the stomach to uphold security commitments. This does not mean the United States should massively expand its arsenal; rather it can take steps to signal resolve, such as more unambiguous statements about commitment to allies’ security, exercising, and consultation. The Biden administration has already pursued some of these measures, but delays in budget approvals and lack of visibility for nuclear issues could undermine such efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resolve is also a political exercise. U.S. adversaries and allies know of U.S. domestic political polarization. Russian president Vladimir Putin seems to be content with a temporary stalemate in Ukraine while he waits in hopes of former U.S. president Donald Trump’s reelection. Xi may similarly be waiting for a change in administration that will see many of Biden’s regional initiatives overturned, such as AUKUS and the Nuclear Consultative Group dialogue with South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the United States works to deter China, assure U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific region, and demonstrate resolve vis-à-vis Beijing, it will need to ensure its efforts do not come at the cost of credibility with European allies. Security for Seoul should not come at the expense of credibility with Warsaw. Capabilities will play an important role in demonstrating resolve in both theaters, though U.S. domestic politics, ultimately, have become a problem for nuclear deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The surge in the global supply and demand for both a spectrum of long-range standoff capabilities and the means to contend with them is a defining feature of a new missile age.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of the Pentagon’s last two National Defense Strategy documents have identified China as a strategic and pacing threat to the United States and its allies. Within the military dimension of that strategic competition, an increasingly diverse, numerous, and sophisticated spectrum of aerial and missile threats has assumed an outsized importance. Once regarded as a niche or boutique problem, these missile threats have now become weapons of choice. The surge in the global supply and demand for both a spectrum of long-range standoff capabilities and the means to contend with them is a defining feature of a new missile age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, missile defense efforts have largely been directed at rogue state ballistic missile threats, especially from those armed with weapons of mass destruction. The threat from major powers represents a far more complex problem. U.S. air and missile defense efforts require considerably more adaptation than that which has been undertaken to date to contend with the scale and urgency of this threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least five areas of improvement are worth consideration to adapt U.S. air and missile defenses to better contend with the military competition with major powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is that of policy. Not so long ago, it seemed in many quarters unthinkable to put Russia or China in the same sentence as missile defense. Over the past two years, the successful engagement of Kinzhals and hundreds of other high-end missiles in Ukraine have decisively chipped away at the idea that such threats are unstoppable. Now it should be unthinkable not to contemplate active defense. While still relying upon nuclear forces to deter large-scale, strategic nuclear attacks, the specter of nonnuclear strategic attacks makes such defensive measures indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second area, the principal effort to realize the defense of nonnuclear strategic attack, is the collection of efforts to provide air and missile defense for the island of Guam. Besides being U.S. sovereign territory and homeland of Americans, the principal reason for defensive investments for Guam has everything to do with the military forces dependent upon the island for power projection and deterrence. While passive defense measures should be maximized fully, some things that cannot be moved or hidden must be defended. Doing so will require every tool in the toolbox of today’s air defenders and the development of new ones. To defend against the full spectrum of threats from a near-peer in their backyard will require integration among several air and missile defense systems, not just to create a common air picture but to achieve integrated fire control to optimize and deconflict engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third capability area is the specific area of cruise missile defense, relevant not just to Guam but to bases throughout the United States Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) and beyond. Garden-variety cruise missiles represent one of the most underappreciated, high-capacity, and near-term threats to U.S. forces and the homeland. The U.S. Army’s efforts for cruise missile defense will need to be kept on schedule and expanded. Since being named the lead service for air and cruise missile defense of the homeland, the U.S. Air Force is advancing critical work on domain awareness and over-the-horizon radars. Further work will be required to increase cruise missile intercept capacity both in the homeland and in the Pacific, much of which will likely need to be ground-based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the lower end of the aerial threat spectrum is the need to counter the seemingly humble but increasingly ubiquitous category of systems called unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Despite receiving their own category, UAS threats might be conceived as the next generation of the categories previously dubbed fixed wing, rotary wing, and cruise missiles. As the next chapter of air defense, counter-UAS (C-UAS) will require organizational and training changes, not just for dedicated air defenders but across the entire Joint Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States does not get to pick which parts of the air and missile threat spectrum China will mix and match to hold U.S. forces at risk. The fifth and final category is, therefore, not optional. The ability to defeat high-speed maneuvering threats, or various kinds of so-called hypersonic missiles, represents a necessary capability to counter significant Chinese investments in the area. These include boost glide vehicles, scramjet powered cruise missiles, orbital bombardment, and space planes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important progress has been made so far for the first component, space-based sensors capable of tracking unpredictable missiles from birth to death — but the capability is still far from being realized. Questions remain about schedule and fire control requirements for these forthcoming sensor layers. A second component, the kinetic or non-kinetic means to defeat these threats, must also be developed with all deliberate speed. Past aversions to space-based capability must likewise be overcome. Although the implications of embracing space as a warfighting domain have yet to be fully internalized, advanced capabilities in and from space will be critical to the future of missile defense and defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not get to choose which sort of threats China will pose. The specter of complex, structured, and integrated missile attacks requires attention to the full spectrum of defenses, from mud to space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Overall, 2024 is likely to be a determining year for cross-strait relations. If the survey results reflect Beijing’s calculus, China is likely to further escalate coercion and demonstrate its displeasure against Taiwan beyond what it has done during the Tsai administration.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year 2024 will be critical for determining cross-strait dynamics for at least the next four years, if not longer. Current Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) who has served for two terms, is stepping down. The election of current Taiwan vice president and DPP candidate William Lai on January 13, 2024, will shift cross-strait dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beijings-approach-toward-taiwan-will-become-more-coercive&quot;&gt;Beijing’s Approach toward Taiwan Will Become More Coercive&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2023, prior to the Taiwan elections, the CSIS China Power team conducted a survey of leading U.S. and Taiwan experts to help forecast what to expect in 2024. The survey showed that over 80 percent of leading thinkers in both regions believed that China would not maintain its current approach toward Taiwan after the elections. Instead, they believed Beijing was approaching a fork in the road, where it could adopt starkly different ways of dealing with the island depending on if China views the winning Taiwan leader as more pro-China or pro-independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surveyed experts believed that a candidate who was more preferred by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) — such as Kuomintang (KMT) leader Hou Yu-ih or Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) leader Ko Wen-je — and was willing to affirm support for the 1992 Consensus in one form or another could encourage Beijing to improve ties with the island. This could come in the form of more PRC political or economic “carrots” or reduction in the use of “sticks” or coercion against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, 46 percent of Taiwan experts were optimistic, believing that China would unilaterally improve ties with the island if one of its more preferred candidates won. This contrasted with 46 percent of U.S. experts who assessed that the newly elected Taiwan president would need to showcase goodwill first before China would take a positive step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents were less certain how Beijing would respond if its least preferred candidate, William Lai, won the Taiwan presidency. China views Lai as significantly more provocative and pro-independence than Tsai. Here, the results from the CSIS China Power survey were mixed. Half of U.S. and Taiwan experts believed that China would escalate against the island in the event of a Lai presidency, regardless of what the new Taiwan president does — indicating that China’s anxieties and deep-seated animosity toward Lai likely clouds and shapes PRC thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this logic holds, it is possible that China may react more negatively and strongly to Lai even if he embraces the exact same actions as Tsai. Similarly, China could react more negatively toward U.S. support to Lai, including against high-level congressional visits to Taiwan as well as U.S. arms sales to the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wide-ranging-views-on-how-china-could-escalate&quot;&gt;Wide-Ranging Views on How China Could Escalate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of how Beijing could respond to Lai’s victory, the majority of U.S. and Taiwan experts believed that China would reserve its most escalatory measures until at least after Lai is inaugurated on May 20, 2024 (or even later, after he has implemented significant policy changes). China had already increased pressure on Taiwan in the lead-up to the elections, and this buildup could continue post-election. Over a third of Taiwan experts, however, were worried that China would embrace its most escalatory response against Taiwan after the election but before the inauguration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, even in the event of Lai’s victory, 60 percent of U.S. experts believed that the most escalatory option that China would take in 2024 is a large-scale military exercise encircling Taiwan (achieving temporary blockade-like effects). A handful of U.S. experts believe that if dynamics worsen, there is a possibility that China could quarantine, blockade, or even invade Taiwan in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan experts were less pessimistic. Forty-nine percent assessed that China will maximize non-military coercion of Taiwan. This could include China’s efforts to undermine and stir chaos within Taiwan’s democracy, PRC economic coercion of the island, as well as China’s attempts to squeeze the island’s international space. This is more than the 43 percent of Taiwan participants who think China will launch a large-scale military exercise. A handful of Taiwan experts believed that China could quarantine Taiwan, but none assessed that China would blockade or invade the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-to-expect-in-2024&quot;&gt;What to Expect in 2024&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, 2024 is likely to be a determining year for cross-strait relations. If the survey results reflect Beijing’s calculus, China is likely to further escalate coercion and demonstrate its displeasure against Taiwan beyond what it has done during the Tsai administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discrepancy in the survey between U.S. and Taiwan expert views showcases how difficult it is to forecast potential PRC courses of action given the wide range of political, economic, and military tools that Beijing could leverage against Taipei. Whereas U.S. experts tend to focus on PRC military activities as most escalatory and problematic, Taiwan experts are slightly more worried about other types of PRC actions in the political, economic, and information domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, Beijing is likely to embrace whatever political, economic, or military measures it believes will best assert its control over Taiwan and allow Beijing to make “progress” on unification. Beijing will likely use a combination of different and wide-ranging measures against the island. In addition, China’s willingness to escalate large-scale military exercises around Taiwan in August 2022 and April 2023 suggest that Xi is willing to push forward on Taiwan even if such actions could trigger potential costs and international blowback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has also been much speculation on whether internal PRC conditions, such as the state of China’s economy, will significantly dampen or elevate Beijing’s appetite to take risk vis-à-vis Taiwan. The CSIS China Power survey finds that 50 percent of leading U.S. experts assess that a sharp, prolonged PRC economic downturn will not impact potential PRC use of force against Taiwan. A dominant reasoning is that strategic and political factors will determine whether China decides to use significant military force against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan experts, however, were more divided and believed China’s economic conditions mattered more. Thirty-seven percent did not believe China’s domestic economic troubles impacted PRC use of force against the island; 34 percent believed they would decrease PRC use of force; and 29 percent believe they would increase the likelihood of use of force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to carefully monitor conditions within the PRC, but for now, the main determinant of China’s approach to Taiwan in 2024 and beyond is likely to be how China perceives Lai’s words and actions, particularly after he assumes the Taiwan presidency in late May 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Precisely because a direct attack on Taiwan brings unacceptable risk to Beijing, Xi is therefore likely disposed to ramp up coercive actions that seek to demoralize the Taiwan people and, crucially, create scenarios where the U.S. commitment to Taiwan is clearly and publicly tested.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is certain that Chinese leader Xi Jinping seeks Taiwan’s de jure absorption or annexation into the People’s Republic of China (PRC), there remain vexing ambiguities and uncertainties about how he is seeking to achieve this goal, how much risk he is willing to accept, and what cost — diplomatic, economic, reputational, military — he is willing to absorb in the pursuit of his objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some analysts argue that Xi represents a clear break with Beijing’s long-standing approach to cross-strait issues, the evidence does not support this conclusion. Xi’s rhetoric on Taiwan is largely consistent with that of his predecessors in Beijing. Deng Xiaoping stated in 1983, “We shall complete the unfinished task of reunification left to us by our predecessors,” an early formulation of Xi’s later urging that the Taiwan issue should not “be passed down from generation to the next.” Deng’s immediate successor, Jiang Zemin, declared that “reunification” was China’s “sacred mission.” Hu Jintao oversaw the passage of the 2005 “anti-secession law,” which stipulated — albeit vaguely — the circumstances under which Beijing would use military force to compel “reunification.” The substance of Xi’s approach to cross-strait relations has also been largely consistent with the long-standing admixture of coercive cudgels and attempted economic inducements. Individuals and actors who adhere to Beijing’s “one China principle” are rewarded and favored, while those who push for Taiwan’s expanded autonomy and security are demonized and punished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has changed is the intensity of Beijing’s coercion and intimidation, and the expansion and increasing sophistication of the tool kit it can bring to bear. Where for much of the past 75 years, Chinese leaders were forced to contend with a vastly superior U.S. military, over the last two decades, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has undergone an unprecedented military modernization and buildup. While it may not yet be able to vie with the United States for its ability to project power globally, the capabilities it can now focus on the waters in and around the Taiwan Strait are extraordinary, to say nothing of the investments it is currently making in future capabilities that will further complicate U.S. calculations. Although the PLA is evolving to play a more global role, the core focus of its efforts remains on having the capability to seize Taiwan and repel a counter-invasion coalition led by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Beijing, a credible threat of invasion remains the bedrock of its political deterrence strategy. Without it, Beijing fears that Taiwan would move rapidly toward de facto or de jure independence, expand diplomatic relations with international partners and its role in international institutions, and seek to forge an even stronger security relationship with the United States, Beijing’s chief rival. Ensuring that the PLA’s military threat is seen as credible therefore requires regular demonstrations of power and capability, from military exercises to calculated rhetorical pressure and warnings. Beijing also believes that Taipei and Washington (and increasingly third countries like Japan, Singapore, and the Philippines) must believe that Beijing has more “skin in the game” and is willing to risk more than anyone else to ensure Taiwan’s annexation. Thus, the recent uptick in what the U.S. Department of Defense calls “coercive and risky intercepts” of U.S. and allied aircraft by the PLA is not incidental or accidental but rather essential to a strategy of demonstrating that Beijing will go to war and risk everything to protect “territorial sovereignty.” Added to this military campaign is the significant political, informational, economic, and diplomatic pressure Beijing leverages in an attempt to deter the United States and third countries from strengthening relations with Taipei and, relatedly, convince the Taiwan people that they are isolated and alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet just because Beijing has a better tool kit doesn’t mean it has a better strategy. Indeed, in many ways, Beijing’s cross-strait approach stands at an inflection point. The policy of economic inducement pursued during the Ma Ying-jeou era (2008–2016) collapsed under the weight of domestic political opposition in the form of the Sunflower Movement. China’s continued and widespread use of economic coercion against Taiwan and a growing number of countries further undercuts Beijing’s faith in the efficacy of economic carrots. The full cutoff of relations with Taipei after the 2016 election of Tsai Ing-wen hasn’t yielded a Taiwan population that is more compliant with Beijing or more interested in “reunification.” In fact, the situation is quite the opposite, with polling data showing that fewer and fewer Taiwan people see a future in unification with the PRC. And Beijing’s campaign of repression in Hong Kong and its active support for Russia’s war on Ukraine have only strengthened Taiwan domestic solidarity against rule by Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at unfolding events and dynamics in the Taiwan Strait, the United States faces a quandary. On the one hand, Chinese leaders likely still see a direct military assault on Taiwan, or a blockade of the waters around it, as prohibitively risky. Even while recognizing that events of the past several years have shattered the illusion that geopolitics is foreseeable, or that dictators follow a predictable straight line, in the absence of a significant deterioration in the U.S.-China relationship or some other exogenous change, the prospect of a Chinese invasion or blockade of Taiwan (an act of war under international law) remains low. As it stands, Xi Jinping is more conservative and cautious than his strategic ally, Vladimir Putin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But precisely because a direct attack on Taiwan brings unacceptable risk to Beijing, Xi is therefore likely disposed to ramp up coercive actions that seek to demoralize the Taiwan people and, crucially, create scenarios where the U.S. commitment to Taiwan is clearly and publicly tested. Many such efforts will undoubtedly fail on their own terms, instead further galvanizing the Taiwan people and highlighting the importance of Taiwan to the international community. Yet others will undoubtedly succeed. Some will discourage international actors from taking a bolder stance on Taiwan’s security through the use of direct or indirect threats. Other actions will create or leverage domestic divisions within Taiwan. And, consequentially, Beijing will look for space to probe or outright challenge the United States’ long-standing commitment to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are critical steps the United States can take to meet this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the discussion in Washington should be reoriented away from a narrow focus on still unlikely scenarios, like an invasion or blockade, and instead focus on combating the daily campaign of political, economic, diplomatic, and military pressure that Beijing is directing toward Taipei. The more the United States makes the Taiwan issue strictly about invasions, the more hesitant medium and small powers will be to draw closer to Taiwan and support U.S. efforts in the region. Beijing won’t need to invade Taiwan if it can successfully isolate and intimidate the island. U.S. partners and allies should find their own ways to credibly signal to Beijing that it would pay a price (economically, diplomatically, and militarily) for disrupting peace in the Taiwan Strait. Signaling this cost will demand that countries be willing to accept some additional friction with Beijing, but unless and until Xi understands the isolation China would face as a result of aggression, conflict is more, not less, likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should also dramatically step up its efforts to bring radical transparency to the PRC’s actions and behavior in the Taiwan Strait and throughout the South China Sea. The Department of Defense has recently taken steps to highlight the PLA’s growing belligerence in the air and at sea, and such efforts should widen to include not just military domains but also the diplomatic, economic, and political space. Beijing operates best in the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as the United States works to build Taiwan’s and its own defense capabilities, political rhetoric back in Washington is undermining the perceived credibility of its commitments. The Taiwan issue has exploded in importance over the past several years, with policymakers in both parties making public statements on a range of related issues. Some of these signal to Beijing that Taiwan’s prosperity and resiliency are supported by a strong bipartisan coalition, and thus, U.S. commitment will continue indefinitely. Yet other comments unintentionally reinforce Xi Jinping’s view that the United States is looking to pare down its global responsibilities, leading to a U.S. resolve that is weakening, wavering, or fundamentally retreating. Clear, consistent, and sensible comments and actions by policymakers and political leaders in support of Taiwan’s security and prosperity would be the best deterrent to future Chinese aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Key to sustaining deterrence in the Indo-Pacific during a period of potential American distraction — by politics at home and wars in Ukraine and the Middle East — is the role of U.S. allies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The headlines in early January this year were filled with rumors of corruption and incompetence in the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) — but these reports should not serve as an excuse for complacency. In fact, China’s military modernization continues to accelerate, and Xi’s purge of PLA leaders is an indication of the strength of his determination to pursue it. Around the region, Beijing is increasingly aggressive in seeking to coerce its neighbors through a mix of economic, military, and paramilitary tools. The results of the Taiwan election in mid-January will spur Beijing to pressure the new Taiwan government, at a minimum raising the risk of an incident that could easily spiral into conflict. Moreover, China’s maritime coercion in the South and East China Seas shows no signs of diminishing; indeed, there are indications China is planning a 365-day Coast Guard presence in the waters around the Senkaku Islands in 2024. Beijing’s cooperation with Moscow, and the deepening linkages between North Korea and Russia pose further challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key to sustaining deterrence in the Indo-Pacific during a period of potential American distraction — by politics at home and wars in Ukraine and the Middle East — is the role of U.S. allies. As 2024 begins, the picture here is good, but it’s critical to sustain the momentum. The last few years have witnessed a remarkable, and nearly simultaneous, strengthening of U.S. alliances across the region — for the first time in decades. This is a foundation to build upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strengthening is nevertheless fragile, and in some cases easily reversed. Although presidential election years are often resistant to major new alliance initiatives — as allies hedge, seeking to gauge the likelihood of continuity in a new administration — important progress remains possible, and it’s critical to sustain momentum even as November 2024 approaches. Washington should focus on a few concrete steps in its bilateral alliances while sustaining work to build a minilateral security architecture, centered on the U.S.-Japan-Republic of Korea and U.S.-Japan-Australia trilateral groupings. U.S. allies themselves have a key role to play in this consolidation — by demonstrating their own commitment to follow-through and investments at home, they can underscore the importance of continuity in U.S. policy and reinforce deterrence against the rapidly growing challenge from China, while at the same time helping to inoculate themselves from criticism in the United States related to burden sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-cornerstone-bilateral-relationships&quot;&gt;The Cornerstone Bilateral Relationships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The United States and Japan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-Japan alliance enters 2024 on exceptionally firm footing, and this year will bring multiple opportunities to showcase its strength — including a state visit to Washington by Japan’s prime minister this spring and a “2+2” meeting later in year. Japan is entering the second year of a historic defense buildup and so far is moving quickly on key elements of implementation — including the acquisition of long-range “counterstrike” capabilities, establishment of a new joint operational headquarters, and major investments in enhanced readiness for the Self-Defense Force. These moves complement U.S. moves to reinforce deterrence in the western Pacific through force posture enhancements, including formally establishing a Marine Littoral Regiment on Okinawa in November 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year the focus for Washington and Tokyo should be on solidifying these announcements with concrete steps to build a more integrated and operational alliance — steps that will move the relationship in the direction of a more operationally ready alliance and enhance its credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Washington and Tokyo should announce plans to modernize the command structure of the alliance. Washington should begin taking steps to transform U.S. Forces Japan into a truly joint operational command, subordinate to the United States Indo-Pacific Command, to serve as the day-to-day counterpart for Japan’s new permanent joint operational headquarters. The two sides should explore opportunities for co-location of command personnel, perhaps by embedding U.S. liaison officers at Japan’s new headquarters. For its part, Tokyo should prioritize new efforts to strengthen information security and to enhance Japan’s cybersecurity, to include authorizing active cyber defense capabilities. New legislation in these areas is critical to enabling deeper U.S.-Japan operational cooperation and should not be delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The United States and Australia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-Australian alliance is in remarkably strong condition, having advanced the diplomatic, defense, economic, and climate and clean energy agendas this past year. Washington and Canberra have aligned their diplomatic agendas across the Pacific Islands, taken substantive steps forward toward realizing AUKUS and readying a U.S. rotational submarine presence in western Australia by 2027, broken down barriers to collaborating on advanced technologies, begun building the infrastructure necessary to support more robust force posture in northern Australia, and created mechanisms for increasing cooperation on critical minerals and clean energy. Ambition, then, is not the challenge for the U.S.-Australian alliance. In a year likely to see disruption around the region, and much political churn inside of both Australia and the United States, moving projects into the execution stage will prove key to locking in U.S.-Australian cooperation in and beyond 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, as Australia and the United States scale up force posture initiatives, Washington and Canberra should determine which coordination mechanisms best allow them to set appropriate defense guidelines and build out joint infrastructure. While the priority should be ensuring the readiness of Submarine Rotational Force–West (SRF-West) to host increased numbers of U.S. submarines and U.S. military personnel by 2027, a larger coordination mechanism would aid in the support of increasing numbers of American personnel operating out of an expanding number of Australian bases. The United States and Australia should also increase their ability to produce more capabilities and more munitions, specifically by making further progress on AUKUS Pillar Two initiatives, advancing legislative and regulatory guidelines supportive of lowering barriers to collaboration, and supporting Australian efforts to start producing a greater number and more varied types of munitions by its Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise (GWEO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reinforcing-minilateralism&quot;&gt;Reinforcing Minilateralism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few years have witnessed a proliferation of minilateral groupings, but two in particular should be the focus of U.S. policy in 2024: the U.S.-Japan-Republic of Korea and U.S.-Japan-Australia groupings. For the former, locking in the gains of Camp David should be a priority through another stand-alone trilateral leaders’ meeting, an expanded military exercise program, and deepening dialogue on economic security. Japan and South Korea should take steps to fully normalize their own bilateral defense relationship and announce a framework for cooperation moving forward. For the latter, the three governments should build on Japan’s deployment of F-35 aircraft to Australia to expand trilateral training. A particular opportunity could be defense industrial cooperation; the three countries should define concrete cooperation in developing uncrewed systems. Australia’s Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance effort could also be a platform for trilateral cooperation in manufacturing critical munitions and matériel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sustaining-momentum-in-2024&quot;&gt;Sustaining Momentum in 2024&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other critical steps Washington can take to ensure that deterrence holds in this election year. It should sustain a strong diplomatic calendar in the Indo-Pacific to the degree possible. Presidential travel will be limited, but there should be ample opportunity to host visiting leaders at the White House. Congress should seek opportunities to highlight the increasingly strong bipartisan consensus on China policy and issues in the Indo-Pacific; a joint resolution on the U.S. commitment to allies and partners, and support for a free and open Indo-Pacific, would send a powerful signal of continuity in U.S. policy. A host of other policy efforts related to economic security — including promoting supply chain diversification, strengthening export controls, and advancing cooperation with key allies on advanced and emerging technologies — should remain a major focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. election in November will be an important moment for the Indo-Pacific, but the campaign season need not distract from the focus on sustaining deterrence in this vital part of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The greatest variable in this endeavor is time, which Japan cannot afford to waste if it is to keep pace with China’s rapidly advancing capabilities. This necessitates tough decisions to ensure effective implementation of the defense strategy, including avenues for enhancing security cooperation with the United States.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2022, Japan introduced a new national security strategy in response to what it considers the most severe and complex global security environment since the end of World War II. The strategy identifies China as the greatest strategic challenge to the peace and security of Japan, the international community, and the international order based on the rule of law. In response, Japan committed to employ all the tools of statecraft — what it dubbed comprehensive national power — to underwrite stability and prosperity in collaboration with like-minded countries. Foundational to this project is a new national defense strategy and procurement plan to acquire advanced defense capabilities and strengthen deterrence in Northeast Asia. Parallel advances in security cooperation with the United States under the rubric of the U.S.-Japan alliance, the cornerstone of Japanese security policy, constitute an important pillar of the new defense strategy. Japan and the United States should urgently address the operational implications for alliance cooperation to maximize the impact of this ambitious blueprint for enhancing deterrence in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a nation on the front lines of the China challenge, Japan has pursued a nuanced approach toward Beijing, balancing elements of competition and cooperation to reflect concerns about China’s strategic ambitions while recognizing a degree of economic interdependence and encouraging stability via diplomatic ties. But in light of China’s rapidly advancing military capabilities and recent pattern of coercive activities in the East China Sea and across the Taiwan Strait, Japan resolved to bolster the deterrence side of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new defense strategy is designed to strengthen Japan’s deterrence posture. The government pledged to increase defense spending 60 percent over five years and approved a record $56 billion defense budget for 2024 to acquire a range of advanced defense capabilities. Examples include so-called counterstrike or long-range precision weapons, such as Tomahawk missiles; investments across the cyber, space, and electromagnetic domains; unmanned systems; and counter-hypersonic capabilities, including plans to jointly develop a Glide Phase Interceptor with the United States. The defense strategy also supports new deployments across the Nansei (“Southwest”) Islands to bolster homeland defense and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, an urgent priority amid heightened concerns about the implications of a Taiwan contingency for Japan’s national security. These investments build on defense policy reforms instituted in 2015 based on a reinterpretation of the war-renouncing clause in Japan’s constitution allowing Japan to activate the right to collective self-defense, or the ability to defend the United States or allies and engage in joint operations outside Japan. In short, Japan seeks to enhance its capacity to deter Chinese aggression and strengthen interoperability with like-minded partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest variable in this endeavor is time, which Japan cannot afford to waste if it is to keep pace with China’s rapidly advancing capabilities. This necessitates tough decisions to ensure effective implementation of the defense strategy, including avenues for enhancing security cooperation with the United States. For example, Japan’s military needs to maximize opportunities for training, including joint exercises with U.S. forces, which will prove critical to defending areas such as the Nansei Islands but are too often constrained by sensitivities in local politics. Command and control structures also merit urgent attention. Japan’s Ministry of Defense will set up a new joint operations command by spring 2025 to expedite internal decisionmaking and coordination with the U.S. military. This has prompted debate about whether the United States Indo-Pacific Command, based in Hawaii, should remain the counterpart for managing bilateral operations in an increasingly complex security environment that requires rapid response capabilities. The two governments could also tackle basic operational challenges such as munitions stockpiles, identified as one of seven priority areas in Japan’s defense strategy and a deficiency for the United States that seemingly favors increased emphasis on the co-production of munitions. Neither government should allow bureaucratic resistance to obstruct attempts at reform in these and other areas that could bolster alliance interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential implementation challenges notwithstanding, Japan has established momentum for strengthening its defense capabilities and sending deterrent signals to China. In August 2023, Taro Aso, former Japanese prime minister and vice president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party or LDP, visited Taiwan and stated in a speech that Japan and its allies and partners should deter China by conveying “the will to fight.” Japan is ambiguous about how it might respond in a Taiwan contingency, with potential options including, but not necessarily limited to, homeland defense, defending sea lanes, or providing non-combat support for U.S. operations. But signaling the will to fight complicates Chinese planning, and that itself constitutes a critical element of deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s decision to lean forward on defense is one of the most significant strategic developments in Asia in decades, with the potential to transform its leadership role in the international security order. It is still early days, but the trend line favors a sustained commitment to deterring aggression in partnership with the United States as a foundation for regional stability and future prosperity in the world’s most dynamic region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Another thrust of China’s diplomacy involves playing to lingering mistrust of Western intentions and prescriptions in many capitals across the Global South, emphasizing a sense of shared grievance about the uneven distribution of power and wealth in the international system.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While U.S.-China competition over the future global order makes headlines, middle and smaller powers will play a pivotal role in determining the shape of this order. Many of these countries are members of what some call the “Global South,” a term used to describe middle- and low-income states largely concentrated in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. While many of these states sought power in the mid-twentieth century as members of the Non-Aligned Movement or the “third world,” the Global South has become an increasingly serious player on the world stage in recent years. These countries’ rising profile is reflective of their growing wealth, population, and power and the important role they will play on a widening array of global issues. Yet while the United States and other G7 capitals have embraced a new era of strategic competition and have sharpened their focus on China and, secondarily, Russia as top national security threats, countries of the Global South — which often count China and Russia as like-minded states — are more interested in preserving space for their own economic development and strategic agency. To build its influence, China skillfully plays to these concerns by touting its three-decade history of double-digit economic growth as a model for its partners and by contrasting its own form of unconditional engagement and noninterference in domestic affairs with the conditionality and broad engagement of the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, Beijing has directed substantial financial and diplomatic resources toward building up its influence in and cultivating its image as a member (and leader) of the Global South. The primary thrust of China’s diplomacy has been commercial. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), launched in 2013, aims to deepen bilateral partnerships and build markets for Chinese goods and services. By one estimate, total BRI transactions summed to around $1 trillion from 2013 to 2022. Beijing frequently frames the BRI as a key pillar of its value proposition to the Global South, a signal of commitment to deliver development opportunities beyond its borders. Beijing has also institutionalized cooperation with many states in the Global South by creating special forums for diplomatic interaction and a wide range of educational and cultural exchange programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many lower-income states cannot afford to pass up an opportunity to deepen trade, aid, and investment ties with the world’s second-largest economy. To build influence in the Global South, China casts itself as a partner in technological upgrading as well as economic development and diversification. Another thrust of China’s diplomacy involves playing to lingering mistrust of Western intentions and prescriptions in many capitals across the Global South, emphasizing a sense of shared grievance about the uneven distribution of power and wealth in the international system. Beijing frequently frames itself as a member of the Global South and a champion for a bigger voice for developing countries in international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s engagement with the Global South advances its interests in at least three ways. For one, many developing countries offer both markets and resources key to China’s infrastructure and export-driven growth model. It is no surprise that much of the initial overseas foreign direct investment (FDI) from China, once Beijing began encouraging state-owned enterprises to invest overseas as part of its “go out” initiative in the early 2000s, was concentrated in resource-rich developing countries. Countries in the Middle East offer valuable partnerships for China as a major oil and gas consumer, and state-backed Chinese firms have invested billions in Africa to mine and refine critical minerals pivotal to leadership in clean energy technologies of the future. As ties with advanced economies sour and China’s growth slows, Beijing has intensified efforts to reorient its global trade position, find new markets for its exports, and ensure the sustainable supply of key raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, Beijing sees countries of the Global South as useful partners in leveraging international institutions to serve and protect China’s core interests. By expanding its network of partners, Beijing aims to grow the number of countries it can count on to support — or at least not criticize or oppose — its positions on sensitive issues such as Taiwan, Xinjiang, and the South China Sea in multilateral venues such as the United Nations and on the bilateral level. Research suggests that Beijing has swayed developing countries to amplify its voice in the UN General Assembly, prevent Taiwan’s meaningful participation in international bodies, and deter criticism of its human rights record. Beijing peddles norms of governance, security, and interstate behavior that serve its interests as protecting the interests of developing countries more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, deepening ties with developing economies allows Beijing to undermine Western efforts to build a global order that advances Western interests at the expense of China. In recent years, Washington and advanced industrial economies from Europe to Asia have adjusted their economic and security policies to address China’s assertive turn abroad and repressive turn at home — a development Xi has framed as “all-around containment, blockade, and suppression by Western countries led by the United States.” Countries of the Global South are central to Beijing’s ambitions to expand its partnership network, or — as Xi put it in June 2021 — “enlarge the circle of friends who understand China.” In his speech at the 2018 Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs, Xi stated that “developing countries are our natural allies in international affairs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, recent developments in Beijing’s engagement with the Global South portend a more targeted, assertive, and normative approach — one more colored by U.S.-China competition than in the past. For one, Xi has signaled the BRI will become smaller and greener (“small but beautiful,” as Xi put it at the initiative’s 2023 forum). Most analysts agree that while its top-line dollar value may fall as the country’s willingness to lend has declined, recipient countries are less able to acquire additional debt, and high-profile projects have run into issues, the BRI is not going away. Projects going forward will be smaller but more strategically targeted and more focused on technology and digital infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Beijing has stepped up efforts to expand its normative influence through a range of global initiatives largely aimed at the Global South, including the Global Development Initiative (GDI, introduced September 2021), Global Security Initiative (GSI, introduced April 2022), and Global Civilizational Initiative (GCI, introduced March 2023). Through these initiatives, which largely repackage existing Chinese foreign policy rhetoric under sleek banners, Beijing seeks to advance its image as a provider of global solutions that attend to common needs and priorities within the Global South — at a time when retreats from globalization and rising geopolitical competition throw development trajectories for many of these states into jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Beijing is seeking to temper U.S. global influence by expanding the membership and interoperability of the multilateral groupings in which it holds a central role. For several years, Beijing has pushed for the enlargement of BRICS, which recently welcomed Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Iran, and Ethiopia to its ranks. Saudi Arabia also recently joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a move discussed during Xi’s state visit to the kingdom in December 2022. These groups offer platforms for Chinese leaders to interact directly with partners from the Global South, as occurred during the BRICS summit in September, and they are seen as critical counterweights to tightening ties between the world’s most advanced economies, diluting U.S. global influence. Beijing appears committed to continuing to expand such arrangements in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;At the moment, the United States is playing from behind in the Global South. Given the uneven terms of the competition, it must pursue an overhaul of its tool kit and approach.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has a problem in the Global South: China does not follow traditional rules of development, commercial diplomacy, or debt diplomacy. Compounding the problem is the lack of a positive, forward-looking U.S. agenda that speaks to the hopes and aspirations of countries in the region that would offer a clear advantage over China in the eyes of these bustling economies. Many of the offers the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) provides are appealing, quickly deployed, and relevant to the interests of partners in the Global South. Conversely, the tool kit the United States set up after World War II for soft power, or economic and cultural influence, needs an update. The U.S. approach today is marked by excessive caution and indecisiveness, which stands to benefit the United States’ greatest competitor by driving developing countries to take their partnerships, allegiances (including UN votes and alliances in the multilateral system), technology standards, and commercial ties to China and like-minded countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s lack of standards and rules has created an uneven playing field, allowing the country to take actions it could not imagine a decade ago: it can develop Covid-19 vaccines, offer price- and quality-competitive tech solutions through Huawei, and build roads and provide power through the Belt and Road Initiative. As a result, China has become the number one trading partner to more than 100 countries and is often the number one creditor to developing countries. All of these areas and more are the building blocks of a system of rules, commerce, and finance. China and its illiberal partners, including Russia and Iran, would like to create an alternative to the system that the United States has led and built for the past eight decades. The United States and the West need to make changes or they could lose to China and other authoritarian regimes that seek to further their goal of overturning this rules-based system and, in turn, dictating the global geopolitical landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are a few examples of how the United States should recalibrate its soft power strategy to counter China’s aggressive power grab in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;restructuring-the-aid-approach-for-the-pacific-islands&quot;&gt;Restructuring the Aid Approach for the Pacific Islands&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is not adequately engaging the Pacific Islands — a region the size of Africa with many geostrategic implications. In July 2022, the United States agreed to triple aid for the region to $60 million a year for the next 10 years. In 2023, the White House announced it was working with Congress to commit more than $8 billion to the region. The financing would help with maritime security, climate change issues, and illegal fishing. Still, as the United States has been neglecting the region for decades, the financing is too little, too late. Due to decades of U.S. disengagement, some Pacific Island leaders have pivoted to China, allowing it to fill security and trade voids within the region. China tried to sign a sweeping security and trade deal with 10 nations within the Pacific, though it was unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States urgently needs to do more, including providing more flexibility for government bodies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) or the Department of Defense to tackle grant financing or fund critical infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-a-strategy-for-undersea-cable-networks&quot;&gt;Building a Strategy for Undersea Cable Networks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has not played effectively in building and financing undersea cables — the primary network for voice, data, and internet connectivity — or determining which government agency should take the lead. The United States and China have been waging a soft power underwater cable war as both nations have been fighting for networks and contracts. In 2020 China almost successfully landed a deal with three Pacific nations — Nauru, Kiribati, and Micronesia — to build the East Micronesia Cable, but the plan was eventually upended as Washington warned of security risks. The United States, Australia, and Japan eventually took over the project and agreed to revive it. Although the United States will see more of these challenges, it does not have a complete answer to the war of submarine cable systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cheap-and-high-quality-tech-offering&quot;&gt;Cheap and High-Quality Tech Offering&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the CCP spreads its digital wings across the Global South, the security and artificial intelligence (AI) implications are profound. Huawei, ZTE, and AliPay are the “unholy trinity” of the CCP’s tech backbone for the Global South. They pose serious threats to the democratic world as they create a high risk of unauthorized data collection, which, in turn, leads to major security challenges, including espionage and public opinion meddling. The bad news for the United States is that what China offers is good enough in terms of quality and price. As the United States confronts this challenge, it is not enough to say, “Don’t take the Huawei offer.” Instead, U.S. leaders must enable an alternative coalition of Western countries to provide a competitive price and quality solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-a-mineral-and-mining-strategy&quot;&gt;Building a Mineral and Mining Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining and minerals will be the “new oil” under a carbon transition. At the same time, the United States and the West are not going to move from partial dependence on a series of countries that control large amounts of oil and gas to dependence on China, which controls the majority of mines and mineral processing globally. Many of the world’s minerals are located in the Global South: for example, the Democratic Republic of the Congo accounts for around 70 percent of the world’s cobalt, and Indonesia has close to 40 percent of the world’s nickel. Importantly, critical minerals are almost completely processed in China, and the supply chains are heavily concentrated in China as well. Meanwhile, China is making investments to control 30–40 percent of the global supply of rare earth element production. All of this significantly complicates the West’s efforts in its energy transition from hydrocarbons and its ability to exert geopolitical influence in this realm as these minerals are critical for the production of electric vehicles and other green energy technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;removing-bureaucratic-barriers-to-success&quot;&gt;Removing Bureaucratic Barriers to Success&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building lasting partnerships in the Global South demands a positive, forward-looking agenda that adjusts the U.S. way of operating in the region to meet the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good start is for the United States to streamline its bureaucracy to a decisive strategy and remove any red tape. The petty bureaucratic infighting adds to the indecision and costs time. China knows this and uses internal U.S. tensions as an effective weapon. The United States should not be doing business as usual with China, and this means it does not have the luxury of time. Instead, the United States should be on a war footing: the CCP clearly understands this, so why doesn’t the United States?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States also needs to provide “one-stop shopping” by clearly marketing to countries in the Global South a palette of services free of bureaucratic formalities. Perhaps a way to unclog this financing is for the U.S. government to remove interagency barriers and streamline interagency work so that, for example, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, USAID, and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency all work in a more unified way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the United States is playing from behind in the Global South. Given the uneven terms of the competition, it must pursue an overhaul of its tool kit and approach. The steps outlined here should be at the forefront of U.S. and Western strategy for enhancing competitiveness in a region that will be a primary factor for prosperity and security in the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;

Russian disinformation campaigns have served as a low-cost tactic for Moscow to spread confusion and distrust in the United States and other Western democracies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, Russia has stepped up its disinformation campaigns to erode trust in arms control across the nuclear, chemical, and biological domains. The new era of rapidly disseminated disinformation poses significant challenges to U.S. national security and, more specifically, to arms control verification and compliance. In this polluted information environment, offense is king. This paper examines how the Douma chemical weapons attack eroded the Chemical Weapons Convention, how Russian disinformation about fake Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories undermined trust in the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), and how Russian disinformation campaigns influenced the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. In each of these cases, Russia used diverse tactics and messaging methods — including social media, news media, and diplomatic channels — to spread false information and create political pressures. These campaigns matter for future U.S. arms control efforts because arms control agreements are inherently political tools susceptible to being undermined by political pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian disinformation campaigns have served as a low-cost tactic for Moscow to spread confusion and distrust in the United States and other Western democracies. While these disinformation campaigns have proven effective, they are often rather crudely constructed. Russia often spreads myriad narratives to see which falsehoods stick, an approach Christopher Paul and Miriam Matthews at RAND have dubbed the “firehose of falsehood.” In the three disinformation campaigns discussed here, the spread of Russian propaganda was aided by friendly countries such as China, Syria, and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easier to spread significant amounts of mis- and disinformation than it is to try to counter false information. This challenge is particularly difficult for the U.S. government because public trust in large institutions has declined nearly everywhere across the board, including in large news media. Americans’ public trust in government has hovered below 20 percent for the past 12 years. This contested information environment has largely lacked a credible verifier of last resort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is easier to spread significant amounts of mis- and disinformation than it is to try to counter false information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to accurately assess causality and the impact that disinformation campaigns have, particularly in arms control. Disinformation that goes viral or reaches many people does not necessarily mean there will be tangible ramifications or changes in policy. In each of the three following case studies, Russia’s goals, tactics, and audience changed. Nevertheless, as the U.S. security policy community shifts toward viewing the world as multipolar and dominated by rivalry among three near-peer adversaries, further Russian disinformation will shape the contours of geopolitical competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-studies&quot;&gt;Case Studies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;douma-and-social-media-subterfuge&quot;&gt;Douma and Social Media Subterfuge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 7, 2018, the Syrian military conducted two chemical weapons attacks in Douma, Syria. The first allegedly occurred at approximately 4:00 p.m., with the second at approximately 7:30 p.m. In both attacks, a gas cylinder was dropped into residential areas, one hitting the roof terrace in a residential neighborhood and the second crashing into an apartment, and reports of the smell of chlorine immediately followed impact. While the exact number of deaths is debated, the bombings killed between 40 and 70 people, with hundreds more treated for chemical-related injuries. Initial media coverage and victim reports included conflicting information on what chemical was in the cylinders — chlorine, sarin, or a mix of both — but the final report from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) only found evidence of chlorine at the sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the attack, Israel launched an airstrike on a Syrian air base on April 9, 2018. The United States, United Kingdom, and France also responded with a joint strike on April 14, 2018, destroying a scientific research facility in Damascus, a chemical weapons storage facility west of Homs, and a chemical weapons equipment storage site and important command post near Homs. In addition, the United Kingdom called for the OPCW to host a special session of the Conference of the States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) regarding the alleged chemical weapons use in Syria and the attempted poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal with a chemical weapons agent in the United Kingdom on June 26–27, 2018. The purpose of the special session was to approve a chemical weapons attribution mechanism under the auspices of the OPCW. Ultimately, 82 members voted to establish this investigation and identification team, and 24 (including Russia, China, and Syria) voted against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately following the use of chemical weapons in Douma, a widespread disinformation campaign was launched to deny the occurrence of the attack. This large-scale, persistent disinformation campaign was initially pushed out through official Russian and Syrian Twitter accounts and state-backed media outlets. The seemingly state-directed campaign attempted to flood the information zone with conflicting and contradictory theories and narratives about the attacks in Douma. Overall, the initial disinformation campaign had little impact on public discourse, as mainstream media outlets dominated the information space with coverage of the attack and international response. However, disinformation took over the narrative on Douma after these outlets turned to other news in the following weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike mainstream media outlets, the digital platforms spreading disinformation continued to discuss the attacks past the initial week. According to a study by the Atlantic Council, from April 10 to 16, 2018, “six of the ten most-retweeted posts [about Douma] came from Assad supporters, out of a total 487,000 posts,” suggesting that disinformation dominated conversations on the topic. The number of retweets of and interactions with disinformation related to Douma was aided by networks of synthetic actors, such as trolls, bots, and cyborgs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study by the Center for Nonproliferation Studies found that in the wake of the attacks, networks of synthetic actors in Syria, Russia, and Iran were activated to push narratives meant to defame the OPCW and White Helmets (a humanitarian organization that tracks and assists Syrian communities affected by chemical weapons attacks), discredit claims of Syrian chemical weapons use, suggest jihadists were responsible for the attacks, hint at nuclear escalation in response to Western retaliatory strikes, and “prey on Western religious and cultural sympathies.” This initial disinformation push also coincided with efforts to delay access to the sites by the OPCW fact-finding mission, which arrived in Douma on April 14, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One week after the attack, the digital disinformation morphed into a complex and hybridized campaign, linking online activists and propaganda blogs via social media. Counternarratives regarding Douma moved quickly beyond propaganda websites with manipulated journalistic content to spread through a network of online activists and journalists with a track record of opposing “Western interventionist” policies and international institutions. This resulted in a new wave of disinformation in which experts from prominent universities or former military officials further pushed disinformation on Douma, often tying the counternarratives in with other conspiracy theories. Digital disinformation was also promoted by more mainstream influencers — such as actress Susan Sarandon, MIT professor Dr. Theodore Postol, and then–presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard — proving recognizable voices can become enablers of false and misleading narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Douma incident serves as an interesting case study of digital disinformation due to two information “leaks” at the OPCW following the publication of official findings. The OPCW’s final report was published on March 1, 2019, nearly one year after the attack, declaring evidence of the use of chlorine but no evidence of nerve agents. While the report was met with pushback from Syrian and Russian supporters, the results did not gain significant traction in public discourse — that is, until October 2019, when WikiLeaks published unauthorized reports by two “whistleblowers” who disputed the OPCW’s official findings. An independent investigation ensued, concluding the whistleblowers misrepresented their connections to the OPCW and the Douma investigations team and committed a serious, deliberate, and premeditated breach of confidentiality. The OPCW stood by its findings, but the damage was done; declarations of a coverup made their way into mainstream media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian disinformation had an advantage in the Douma case, as it was able to spread quickly by tapping into existing conspiracy theories that further muddied the information space. The interaction of disinformation across social media platforms and personal blogs allowed the disinformation to reach wider audiences — and reach them more quickly than the United States and OPCW could counter the narratives. The OPCW took one year to publish a final report of findings on the attacks in Douma, leaving the information space open to disinformation and manipulation in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, open-source intelligence (OSINT) investigations by nongovernmental organizations played an important role in countering disinformation while the OPCW conducted its investigation. OSINT investigators at Bellingcat were able to use photos and videos on social media to piece together the timeline of the attack, geolocate roughly where the attacks took place, estimate the number of victims, and tentatively determine that the attack was the result of a gas cylinder most likely filled with chlorine gas dropped from a Mi-8 Hip helicopter originating from Dumayr Airbase in Syria. Similarly, on June 24, 2018, two months after the attack, the New York Times published an augmented-reality visual investigation of the Douma attacks using images and videos found on social media. These OSINT publications provided a factual and credible source to which policymakers could point during their attempts to counter disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ukrainian-biolabs-and-the-importance-of-expert-messengers&quot;&gt;Ukrainian Biolabs and the Importance of Expert Messengers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to invading Ukraine, Russia carried out a sustained disinformation campaign to justify military intervention. From October 2021 to December 2022, disinformation claimed that the United States was developing biological weapons in Ukrainian laboratories to use against Russia. During the Ukraine “biolabs” campaign, Moscow leveraged international partnerships with China to spread these accusations. For example, Lieutenant-General Igor Kirillov (chief of the Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Protection Troops of the Russian Armed Forces) asserted in March 2022, “We can say with a high probability that one of the goals of the United States and its allies is the creation of bioagents capable to selectively infect various ethnic groups.” The U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency’s (DTRA) Biological Threat Reduction Program does invest in biological research at several laboratories in Ukraine. However, this research does not develop biological weapons but rather aids in manufacturing medical countermeasures and enhancing biosafety, biosecurity, and biosurveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The origins of these Russian allegations began long before the war in Ukraine. However, in the run-up to the war, Russia began recirculating disinformation about fake U.S. biological weapons laboratories. On October 7, 2021, the Russian and Chinese ministers of foreign affairs expressed “serious concerns” about the United States’ “military biological activities” in a joint statement at the UN General Assembly regarding the BWC. On February 4, 2022, Russian president Vladimir Putin and Chinese president Xi Jinping reiterated this stance in a joint statement at the winter Olympic games, emphasizing that “domestic and foreign bioweapons activities by the United States and its allies raise serious concerns and questions for the international community regarding their compliance with the BWC.” Three weeks later, Russia invaded Ukraine and further promoted disinformation about Ukrainian biolabs to justify the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disinformation about alleged U.S. biological weapons laboratories was further spread by American right-wing pundits such as Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, and Alex Jones. In February and March 2022, the hashtag #biolabs trended across Twitter. In the following months, Russia continued its campaign on the international stage. On April 6, Russia hosted an informal session of the UN Security Council to discuss claims of biolabs. On June 29, Russia called for a formal consultative meeting under Article V of the BWC; the formal consultative process opened on August 26 and closed in September but reached no formal conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this process, DTRA responded by putting together fact sheets and YouTube videos. Meanwhile, Russia and China spread disinformation across a wide variety of platforms, including news media, social media, and international forums. China was willing to propagate Russian rumors of U.S. biological weapons labs but was hesitant to claim explicitly that biological labs in Ukraine justified the Russian invasion. These pieces of disinformation were most successful when they were picked up and spread by U.S. domestic audiences, particularly audiences on the far right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this disinformation campaign, the United States was placed on the defensive and struggled to respond to Russian lies. Washington worked with partners to provide fact sheets and disseminate accurate information about the nature of U.S. labs overseas. However, these fact sheets were not as effective because they were not spread on social media as widely as the disinformation and because many Americans themselves did not believe them. Additionally, since DTRA was the target of the initial Russian disinformation attacks, the agency’s response was less credible due to the lack of third-party validation by actors with large social influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;diplomacy-and-disinformation-the-intermediate-range-nuclear-forces-treaty&quot;&gt;Diplomacy and Disinformation: The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The INF Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union, and later Russia, entered into force in 1987. The treaty first eliminated existing nuclear and conventional ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs) and ground-launched ballistic missiles with an intermediate range — defined in the treaty as 500–5,500 kilometers (310–3,420 miles) — and prohibited both countries from developing new ones. However, in 2013, Washington began to express concerns to Moscow that the Russian Novator 9M729 (SSC-8) missile violated the INF Treaty. Early in 2014, U.S. officials met with NATO’s Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Committee in Brussels to inform the committee of Russia’s confirmed tests of a GLCM of intermediate range, to which Russia responded that U.S. violations were “a lot more numerous.” In July, the U.S. Department of State’s annual Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and Commitments report stated the United States had determined Russia was in violation of its obligations under the INF Treaty. The United States continued to raise concerns over Russian noncompliance throughout 2014 and 2015, including at the 2014 Wales NATO summit, at the 2015 Review Conference for the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), in the Department of State’s 2015 report on arms control compliance, and at a press conference at NATO Allied Command in June 2015. Russia’s response to the allegations was to deflect, stating that the U.S. Aegis Combat System installed in Romania was not in compliance with the treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2016 report in the New York Times cited anonymous U.S. officials who raised concerns that a new Russian program to field GLCMs violated the INF Treaty. As a result, in November 2016 the United States called for a special verification commission — which included representatives from Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine — to address Russia’s alleged noncompliance, though this commission soon stalled. In 2017, although it acknowledged the existence of the SSC-8 GLCM missile, Russia claimed this was not capable of intermediate ranges. At the same time, the North Atlantic Council found the United States to be in compliance with the INF Treaty; the council also identified a Russian “missile system that raises serious concerns” and called on Moscow “to address these concerns. . . and actively engage in a technical dialogue with the United States.” Yet by October 2018, the United States announced intent to unilaterally withdraw from the treaty due to Russia’s noncompliance, giving Moscow a 60-day ultimatum in December 2018 to rectify the issue. NATO’s foreign ministers also formally declared Russia to be in material breach of the INF Treaty. Absent a response, the United States withdrew from the treaty on August 2, 2019, at which point Russia confirmed it was “formally dead.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this period, Russian diplomats used disinformation to deflect and distort the narrative about the INF Treaty. First, they denied the existence of the SSC-8 missile until the United States publicly released information about the new Russian missile. At that time, Russian officials claimed the missile was INF-compliant and that it was the United States, not Russia, that was avoiding discussing the missile. Russian counternarratives centered on claims that the United States was violating the INF Treaty and was solely responsible for its collapse. The Russian Security Council’s deputy secretary, Alexander Venediktov, alleged that the treaty was “unilaterally terminated by the United States, which wanted to remove any legal obstacles to the development of strike weapons.” Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov also claimed that the United States was no longer a trustworthy arms control partner, stating, “The Americans’ recent actions suggest an idea that they would be glad to wreck the entire system of international treaties, at least in the sphere of strategic stability and arms control.” Russian officials continued to deny accusations of INF noncompliance as late as December 2022. Overall, disinformation was deployed through Russian officials in meetings and through Russian state-backed media outlets, such as Russian news agency TASS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia did not deploy high-tech disinformation tactics regarding its missiles, as it did in the Douma and BWC cases, Russian officials’ public statements and state-backed media articles seemed to aim at providing counternarratives to confuse the public. Additionally, Russia’s noncompliance with the INF Treaty was initially difficult for the United States to prove to allies and partners due to the sensitivity of the arms control verification through national technical means (NTM). Moscow frequently stated that because the United States did not provide proof of the alleged violation, Russia was, in fact, in compliance. A concrete public explanation of the Russian violation was not released by the United States until November 2018, when Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats conducted a press briefing. This delay afforded an offensive advantage to Russia, which was able to use disinformation campaigns to drive the narrative by providing far more details and specifics than the United States and to do so in a succinct way. The United States also struggled to prove its accusations without revealing methods and sources for intelligence gathering. Moreover, the technical nature of the violation — regarding what counts as a “ground-launched” missile — was difficult for the public to understand, enabling Russia to sensationalize reports that the United States was trying to undermine strategic stability. Overall, the INF case shows how disinformation can set the narrative regarding noncompliance in arms control, especially when classified sources are used for verification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These studies point to four important findings. First, offense has the advantage when it comes to disinformation. Russia often pushes dozens of narratives in its campaigns. Once one narrative resonates, Russia doubles down on that message. This means that offensive disinformation campaigns can morph and come from many different angles, whereas U.S. attempts to combat disinformation have required sticking to factual accounting, truth, and going on the defensive. Efforts to counter false narratives with fact sheets or press statements also either fail to receive the significant amounts of public attention that disinformation does or are not viewed as credible and trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, across all three case studies, Russian disinformation was most successful when it was picked up and recirculated by domestic U.S. audiences. In the case of Douma, mainstream influencers and experts from prominent universities unknowingly peddled lies about who was behind Syrian chemical weapons attacks. In the biolabs case, Russian disinformation was spread by conservative U.S. media, including Fox News. The implication is that the impacts of Russian disinformation are significantly magnified when narratives are picked up by influential audiences in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, open-source investigations are vital in defending against disinformation. Russian disinformation about Douma was successfully countered in part through the emerging network of OSINT analysts in civil society. The OSINT community used satellite images to verify chemical weapons use and conduct interviews with Syrian victims, greatly discrediting the Russian and Syrian government narrative. While public trust in government and major institutions in the United States is declining, OSINT may help fill a vital role as a verifier of valid information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While public trust in government and major institutions in the United States is declining, OSINT may help fill a vital role as a verifier of valid information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the case studies indicate a series of challenges for the future of arms control negotiations, verification, and compliance. Disinformation creates a polluted information ecosystem that problematizes attempts to prove compliance or noncompliance — and undermines the core principle of transparency by creating false narratives and undermining the authority of the targeted actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the rise in disinformation about arms control institutions and regimes, the United States will need to develop strategies to counter disinformation when it occurs and build overall resilience to disinformation over the longer term. U.S. arms control negotiators, lawyers, inspectors, and policymakers should prioritize ensuring disinformation efforts do not undermine the transparency and confidence-building measures provided by arms control while also enabling effective U.S. verification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Defend forward”&lt;/em&gt; on disinformation. Today, the United States does not have a coherent counter-disinformation strategy in place. Instead, it has adopted a series of ad hoc approaches in response, often leaving it on the back foot. In the future, the United States should adopt a “defend forward” mindset for disinformation, taking a preemptive as opposed to a reactive stance. This includes taking persistent and proactive measures to disrupt or halt malicious disinformation while also focusing on defending critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Encourage flexible responses by streamlining declassification.&lt;/em&gt; Disinformation campaigns are much more difficult to counter when the truth is veiled in classification and secrecy. In the case of the INF Treaty, a lack of publicly available information about the nature of Russian violations complicated U.S. assertions. Conversely, U.S. fact sheets responding to Russian biolabs disinformation alleging violations of the BWC empowered fact-based counterarguments. The U.S. government should encourage flexible declassification — in cases where it would not harm national security — to arm the public with intelligence that can be used to counter future disinformation campaigns. Much of the intelligence that the United States collects can be declassified without revealing sources and methods. The Biden administration effectively utilized this tactic in the lead-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by declassifying evidence about Moscow’s plans and cyberattacks in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Create counter-disinformation measures within arms control treaties.&lt;/em&gt; Disinformation will become a more common tool for adversaries to cause confusion on arms control compliance and verification measures. Future arms control agreements, both formal and informal, should include measures to address and counter any disinformation related to the treaty. This could be done as a consultative commission or as part of compliance and verification. Such mechanisms would require states parties to an agreement to raise concerns of disinformation about the treaty within the commission or through outlined channels — and claims made outside of the official mechanism could be considered a violation of compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Establish a role for OSINT in the arms control process.&lt;/em&gt; OSINT has played a crucial role in countering disinformation in all three arms control challenges discussed above. The U.S. government should consider how to bolster the capacity of OSINT organizations in this role. Support for OSINT efforts could include more government sponsorship of open-source intelligence collection and public training sessions on how to conduct OSINT and counter disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disinformation campaigns surrounding chemical weapons use in Syria, biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine, and INF Treaty violations have already affected arms control agreements. Russian disinformation campaigns have sought to justify arms control violations and undermine global norms against the use of weapons of mass destruction. These challenges will only be exacerbated by new and emerging technologies. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) such as ChatGPT will enable disinformation campaigns to easily draft hundreds of fictitious narratives to spread on social media; deep fakes of political leaders already have the potential to exacerbate political crises; and decentralized and new forms of social media may become increasingly difficult to regulate, making it more challenging to flag and attribute disinformation. All these emerging and present challenges have serious implications for arms control negotiations and implementation. The time is now to begin thinking about how to defend forward against arms control disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 29, Xi Jinping removed nine top military officials in what is being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/china/sweeping-chinese-military-purge-exposes-weakness-could-widen-2023-12-30/&quot;&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; a “purge,” including officials from the Strategic Rocket Forces that oversee China’s nuclear-armed missiles. Subsequent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-06/us-intelligence-shows-flawed-china-missiles-led-xi-jinping-to-purge-military&quot;&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; by Bloomberg indicated the purge was due to “widespread corruption” that has undermined “efforts to modernize the armed forces and raised questions about China’s ability to fight a war,” according to U.S. intelligence. Specifically, Chinese missiles were allegedly filled with water, rather fuel, including many of the missiles in the silo fields recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/us/politics/china-nuclear-weapons.html&quot;&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; by open-source intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruption in the Chinese military rightly should raise questions about its ability to achieve military objectives and reach the “great rejuvenation” envisioned by Xi. The Federation of American Scientists (FAS), for example, stated in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://fas.org/publication/dod-prc-silos-water-know/&quot;&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt;, “these flaws would compromise missile operations” if true, and raised concerns that government information about China’s arsenal may not be accurate or reliable, comparing it to assessments of “systematically overinflated Soviet capabilities” during the Cold War. An accurate understanding of China’s capabilities and Beijing’s threat to the United States and its allies is obviously essential for policymaking. However, the recent news questioning the reliability of China’s missiles should not change anything about current U.S. nuclear policy. The intent of the silos was always unclear, and if anything, Xi has indicated a clear intent to move forward with making them operational and expanding China’s arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-expanding-arsenal&quot;&gt;China’s Expanding Arsenal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021 open-source analysts at FAS and the Center for Nonproliferation Studies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/us/politics/china-nuclear-weapons.html&quot;&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; at least two new Chinese missile fields with over 100 silos per field. If fully functional and armed with nuclear weapons, these missiles would increase the size of China’s strategic arsenal by orders of magnitude. China currently has an estimated &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebulletin.org/premium/2023-03/nuclear-notebook-chinese-nuclear-weapons-2023/&quot;&gt;410 nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;, but the Department of Defense &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/29/2003122279/-1/-1/1/2022-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF&quot;&gt;predicts&lt;/a&gt; this could reach 1,500 by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also continues to produce fissile material through civilian reactors, including a fast breeder reactor currently under construction. At the current rate, it could double its nuclear arsenal, but further expansion would require additional material. The 2023 State Department recent compliance report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/13APR23-FINAL-2023-Treaty-Compliance-Report-UNCLASSIFIED-UNSOURCED.pdf&quot;&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; that “due to the lack of transparency with regard to their nuclear testing activities, concerns remain about the nature of both China and Russia’s adherence to their respective moratoria.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “unprecedented growth of [China’s] nuclear forces” was a focal point for the 2023 bipartisan Strategic Posture Commission. The commission’s report &lt;a href=&quot;https://armedservices.house.gov/sites/republicans.armedservices.house.gov/files/Strategic-Posture-Committee-Report-Final.pdf&quot;&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; that China, along with Russia, is attempting to expand its global influence by relying on military tools. As a result, the commission warned China could undermine the existing international order and increase the risk of conflict and nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-potemkin-arsenal&quot;&gt;A Potemkin Arsenal?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News of the purges, corruption in the military, and potential subversion of China’s missiles raises questions about whether or not these concerns are well founded and if China is on track to develop an arsenal rivaling the United States’ both quantitively and qualitatively by 2035, as predicted, or if it is developing a Potemkin arsenal. But whether China’s missiles are full of water or fuel does not change U.S. strategy toward China for at least three reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, when China’s silo fields were first discovered, there was rightful skepticism about whether they were fully operational and what was the intention behind them. Prior to joining the Biden administration as principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for space policy, then-MIT professor Vipin Narang &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/us/politics/china-nuclear-weapons.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, “Just because you build the silos doesn’t mean you have to fill them all with missiles . . . They can move them around.” In a worst-case scenario, the silos could have been intended as a “sponge” in a nuclear exchange. In a best-case scenario, they could have been intended as a bargaining chip for future arms control negotiations with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China has consistently been opaque about the status and intent of its strategic forces. These purges and questions about the functionality of China’s missiles is just another layer of opacity. U.S. policymakers have been forced to operate in a fog of uncertainty about the credibility of China’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/11/06/united-states-china-nuclear-meeting-no-first-use-arms-control/&quot;&gt;no first-use policy&lt;/a&gt;, its strategic intentions towards its neighbors, and the strategic purpose behind its rapidly expanding arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, while there may be water in some of China’s missiles now, it cannot be assumed that this will remain the case. Xi’s dramatic response to the corruption indicates he is serious about building up China’s nuclear forces. Rather, this news reinforces the need for improved intelligence and understanding of China’s strategic forces and decisionmaking in Beijing. A recent report by the International State Department Advisory Board, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ISAB-Report-on-Deterrence-in-a-World-of-Nuclear-Multipolarity_Final-Accessible.pdf&quot;&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt;, “the Department of State should better use its resources and insights to help the U.S. government understand how adversaries think and what they value, with a particular emphasis on managing the deterrence relationships with them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;options-for-reducing-nuclear-risks&quot;&gt;Options for Reducing Nuclear Risks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Xi’s purge and questions about the state of the Chinese arsenal may not change anything in U.S. strategic planning, they do reinforce the need for cooperative arms control and risk reduction with Beijing. Transparency and arms control traditionally work hand in hand, as states are reluctant to sign up to agreements without having some means of confirming compliance. Additionally, however, transparency can reduce risks of misperception and escalation. Historically, China has consistently rejected efforts at bilateral or trilateral engagement on its nuclear arsenal. In the final year of the Trump administration, for example, China &lt;a href=&quot;https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/29/trump-china-new-start-nuclear-arms-pact-expiration/&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to engage with the United States and Russia in discussing potential limitations on nuclear warheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Beijing may be softening on its position toward arms control. In November 2023 State Department officials in the Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence, and Stability &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/assistant-secretary-mallory-stewarts-meeting-with-the-peoples-republic-of-chinas-prc-ministry-of-foreign-affairs-director-general-of-arms-control-sun-xiaobo/&quot;&gt;met&lt;/a&gt; with their Chinese counterparts for “candid and in-depth discussion on issues related to arms control and nonproliferation as part of ongoing efforts to maintain open lines of communication and responsibly manage the U.S.-PRC relationship” prior to the Biden-Xi meeting in San Francisco. And in January this year, China participated in military-to-military &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3641103/pentagon-officials-host-chinese-counterparts-for-high-level-talks/&quot;&gt;dialogues&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in years. The Department of Defense used the opportunity to stress the importance of operational safety in the Indo-Pacific region and freedom of navigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these dialogues did not yield any concrete arms control agreements, they have the potential to be a meaningful foundation for future progress. Another potential future forum for progress is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kcl.ac.uk/csss/assets/the-p5-process-opportunities-for-success-in-the-npt-review-conference.pdf&quot;&gt;P5 process&lt;/a&gt;, which China will lead for one year starting in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian war in Ukraine has finally taken on the character of a protracted one, and as is characteristic of any protracted war, degrading the enemy’s will to continue the struggle has become one of the most important goals on which the military and non-military efforts of the Kremlin are focused. The missile attacks on Ukrainian cities over Christmas and New Year, as well as the persistent work of the Russian special services to undermine support for Ukraine in NATO and EU countries –carried out with the help of numerous agents of influence including politicians, journalists and experts in these countries – are both designed to achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ukraine, despite already almost two years of devastating conflict, more than 74% of the population are still in favour of continuing the war until the complete liberation of all occupied territories. In the West, however, both public attitudes and the attitudes of ruling elites are showing signs of fatigue, putting at risk the volume of military-technical assistance to Ukraine. The failure of the US government to secure approval from Congress to finance aid to Ukraine for 2024 is an example of the success of Russian efforts, albeit indirect. Clearly, if the level of support for Ukraine in US society remained at the level of an absolute majority, as it was in 2022, refusing to vote for the allocation of aid would be tantamount to political suicide. Yet at the end of 2023, despite the fact that 50% of Republican Party voters still support sending weapons and military equipment to Ukraine, such a refusal has become a political reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the threat of ending or at least reducing the amount of aid to Ukraine will only grow in the future, it is worth assessing the consequences of a complete or even partial victory for Russia. For Ukraine, the consequences are mostly clear. Putin does not hide his genocidal intentions to destroy Ukraine as an independent state and Ukrainians as a separate people. The continuation of the war is necessary to achieve these goals, as it allows not only the physical destruction of those Ukrainians who are ready to offer armed resistance (so-called “demilitarisation” in the terms of the Kremlin’s “special military operation”), but also the creation of conditions incompatible with normal life for millions of civilians – both in the occupied territories and in other areas – forcing them to leave Ukraine and seek refuge in other countries (so-called “denazification”, which is essentially nothing more than ethnic cleansing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the help of the West, Ukraine is currently able to deter Russian aggression along the contact line, inflict significant daily losses on Russian troops, and destroy most of the missiles and drones with which Russia is attacking civilian infrastructure, as well as disable the use of Russian aircraft. Although the threat to the civilian population remains, Ukrainians prefer to stay in their country, and even those who went abroad in the first months of Russia’s aggression are gradually returning to Ukraine. The number of Ukrainian refugees in Europe is gradually decreasing: of the 8 million Ukrainians who fled the war in 2022, only about 4 million remain in Europe. But such a situation is extremely fragile, and depends directly on the provision of aid to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even a short-term loss of the Armed Forces of Ukraine’s ability to deter Russian aggression will inevitably upend the current equilibrium. Ukrainians will undoubtedly continue the struggle even in such a scenario, but it will increasingly bear the character of an irregular insurgent war, under the conditions of which it will be practically impossible to keep large territories under Ukrainian control, and even more so to protect the civilian population. It is enough to look at Syria to imagine the nature of such a confrontation. The methodical use of airstrikes and the destruction of cities that resist Russian troops would not leave Ukraine with much of a chance even in the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The unwillingness of the US to provide Ukraine with enough weapons to win a war with Russia calls into question the US’s readiness to protect individual NATO countries from Russian aggression&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is obvious that if Ukraine loses support from the West, Putin may well achieve his goal of destroying Ukrainians as a people and erasing the largest country from the map of Europe. Despite the obvious tragedy of this situation for Ukraine, the consequences of its defeat for the West and especially for the US as the leader of the free world would be no less catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that the West prefers to consider this war as a bilateral conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the Russian leadership perceives and positions it as a one-on-one confrontation with the US and NATO, where Ukraine serves only as a proxy. This perception is widespread not only in Russia itself, but also in other autocratic states and countries across the Global South. Thus, any situation that can be passed off by Russia as a victory – that is, any achievements resulting from its aggression – will be perceived by these countries as a direct defeat of the West and the US in particular. At the same time, such a defeat would be perceived as a military one, where the West – led by the US – did not have sufficient military means to support the operations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, even though it did not have to participate with its own troops. This would undoubtedly have a very negative impact on the perception of the US as the world’s leading military power; it would encourage countries such as China, Iran and North Korea to continue their own military expansion; and it would also force the countries of the Global South to seek special relationships with these countries, displacing the US as an international security broker. This would further undermine the US position in the Global South, which is already at its weakest since the end of the Cold War. Not only would this lead to a weakening of the West’s ability to use the military infrastructure of these countries, but it would also limit access to their markets, as well as the ability to obtain strategic materials from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Russian victory in Ukraine is highly likely to destroy NATO, at least in its current form. From its creation, the Alliance was an agreement between the US and Europe, according to which the US undertook to protect Europe from the Soviet threat. In exchange for this, among other things, European countries made their military infrastructure available to the US, undertook to develop their own defence capabilities, and recognised the undisputed military leadership of the US in the event of a war with the USSR. After a brief period of uncertainty regarding NATO’s goals that followed the collapse of the USSR, the main threat to the Alliance once again emanates from Russia. The unwillingness of the US to provide Ukraine with enough weapons to win a war with Russia, where the US is not required to send its own troops, calls into question the US’s readiness to protect individual NATO countries from Russian aggression, where sending US troops would be the only option. Moreover, given the trends in US policy towards abandoning the Eisenhower Doctrine in favour of isolationism, there is a real threat that in the foreseeable future the US government may even reconsider its commitments to providing military aid to European countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is obvious that without US troops, and especially without the US nuclear umbrella, European countries will not be able to defend themselves in the event of a full-scale war with a nuclear state. Awareness of the high risk of losing US protection may force the leaders of European states to start looking for bilateral security arrangements with Russia or China, either of which may offer to step in as a security broker, as has already happened in the Middle East. Undoubtedly, the withdrawal of the US from Europe – which was and remains the principal goal of first Soviet and now Russian active measures – would be immediately capitalised upon by filling the resultant vacuum with Russian and Chinese influence. For the US, the loss of Europe would be equivalent to losing the status of leader of the free world, and together with the loss of European markets, it would mean the inevitable end of the era of US political, military and economic dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Any attempt to conclude a peace treaty with Russia, according to which Ukraine could survive in some form despite the loss of territory and sovereignty, would just be another Minsk Agreement&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Russian victory in Ukraine would destroy the modern system of global nuclear security, pushing the world into an inevitable period of nuclear war. The destruction of Ukraine, which in 1993 gave up the world’s third-largest arsenal of nuclear weapons after receiving security guarantees from Russia, the US and the UK, would be an absolute argument in favour of the idea that the only means of protection against aggression by nuclear states is the possession of nuclear weapons of one’s own. The combination of Russian conventional aggression with threats to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine, as well as the willingness of other guarantors to sacrifice Ukraine to Russia in order to avoid nuclear escalation, would leave no room for any misreading. More and more non-nuclear countries would seek to acquire their own nuclear weapons. Given the increasing number of countries possessing nuclear arsenals, their practical use in a conflict is only a matter of time. Breaking the taboo on the use of nuclear weapons would create a new reality, the tragic characteristics of which are hard to imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there is no alternative to defeating Russia in Ukraine. Any attempt to conclude a peace treaty with Russia, according to which Ukraine could survive in some form despite the loss of territory and sovereignty, would just be another Minsk Agreement – namely, giving Putin the strategic pause necessary to prepare the next phase of aggression. There is no way to force Putin to follow through on such a deal, even if it were made, and no reason to believe that he would voluntarily refrain from carrying out his original plan to destroy Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, defeating Russia in Ukraine remains quite achievable and requires only a review of approaches to supporting Ukraine in this war. In the current confrontation, Russia is at the limit of its capabilities, directing about 30% of its state budget to supporting the war. In 2023, the war cost Russia about $100 billion. Russia will retain the ability to continue the war at this level as long as the prices of gas and oil – the sale of which remains the main source of financing for the Russian budget – remain high. At the same time, the costs of supporting Ukraine on the part of the Western coalition remain lower than the costs for Russia, despite the obvious economic advantage of the West. Moreover, the cost of supporting Ukraine is still less than the cost of the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which the US government estimates cost taxpayers $1.7 trillion. For comparison, the total military aid to Ukraine from the US for the entire duration of the full-scale war has amounted to about $46 billion. Such a situation gives the Russian leadership the impression that the West lacks commitment to achieving a Ukrainian victory and encourages them to continue their aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is believed that an advantage in forces and means of 3 to 1 is necessary for an effective offensive. This rule could also quite easily be applied to the financing of military operations. The only thing needed to win this war is to be ready to send three dollars to support Ukraine for every dollar allocated by Russia. In 2024, Russia will once again spend about $100 billion on the war. The West doesn’t even have to spend its own money to apply the 3 to 1 rule: by a strange coincidence, exactly $300 billion of Russian reserves are now blocked in accounts abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;張劍虹：黎智英認為中國政權隱瞞疫情、欠透明 指示英文版着重反中文章&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wjm3Ktk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（24日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第15日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。WhatsApp 訊息顯示黎因為專欄作家馮睎乾的提議而打算籌辦《蘋果》英文版，並指示張劍虹商量做法。黎在群組中稱，揀選英文作者時只需要集中在《蘋果》的觀點及「黃營」的普遍觀點。張指，由於英文版會揀選一些中文新聞來翻譯，不像中文版般涵蓋較中性和生活化的文章，所以英文版會「會負面啲、極端啲」。黎又在群組中表示，認為英文版應包含更多中國大陸新聞，「疫情肆虐後掀起的反中情緒，這些是美國人最需要看。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹專欄作家馮晞乾提議設英文版-黎遂指示&quot;&gt;張劍虹：專欄作家馮晞乾提議設英文版 黎遂指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹繼續就《蘋果日報》英文版作供。他確認黎智英在2020年5月10日創立一個名為「English news」的 WhatsApp 群組，是群組管理員。黎在群組發送訊息，稱：「今日馮睎乾提議出英譯新聞電子版諗得過，反正現在翻譯網站翻譯成本低而快。」張供稱，黎在訊息中解釋為何有蘋果英文版的構思，是因為專欄作家馮睎乾提議，並且考慮到翻譯成本比以前低了很多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示張發出的訊息：「老闆，重要專題我想是可以做，而不是新聞。如22條、陶輝等。」張解釋，《基本法》第22條是指當時關注若果中聯辦不屬於中央級的機構，已經可以干預香港事務（註：《基本法》第22條規定中央政府所屬各部門、各省、自治區、直轄市均不得干預香港特區自行管理的事務。）；陶輝則是一名警司，當時壹週刊和蘋果日報均有做關於陶輝僭建的「獨家踢爆報導」，張認為上述新聞可以納入英文版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱若外國人想透過支持蘋果來支持香港-蘋果便得救&quot;&gt;黎稱若外國人想透過支持《蘋果》來支持香港 《蘋果》便「得救」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示另一則訊息，由黎於2020年5月10日發送至群組，指示張劍虹商討英文版做法，「若外國人想透過支持我們來支持香港，我們就得救了，越想越覺英文版是我們當下必須做事項。」控方問到黎所指的「支持」是哪一種支持，張指，黎的訊息提及「有了英文版我的期望是，或許有一些關心香港的外國人也訂閱撐我哋。」，顯示黎對英文版的期望，對《蘋果日報》而言，如果是收費訂閱的話，可增加財政收入，同時「亦都是一個政治上嘅保護」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續供稱，他起初建議英文版以 Newsletter 形式推行，即整理報導和專題結集，並傳送給有興趣的讀者。可是經商討後，2020年5月推行的英文版不是 Newsletter 形式，而是在《蘋果》的手機應用程式設立英文版頁面，包含數個部份，分別為新聞、專欄文章、訪問和專題，會每日更新。舊文章會保留數天，而專題和專欄則會保留較久。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱：「請努力量（盡）快推動這事，現在很多美國大媒體要訪問我是想撐我哋，是時候走向美國讀者，讓他們的存在成為我們與美國政治的槓桿，是很大支持柱樑。」張表示不知道為何黎想英文版盡快面世，也不知道為何他提及美國政治。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎曾指示mark-simon邀美官員訂閱英文版-惟未能成功&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎曾指示Mark Simon邀美官員訂閱英文版 惟未能成功&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎的訊息：「這些事要做，可以透過很多美國渠道做，不用太急，但我會叫 Mark 先搞好美國方面發放這消息的方法和渠道。我們現在要專注是怎樣做出外國人認同質素的新聞，專題和評論。怎樣去選擇適合外國人有興趣看，已是我們不易做得到的，馬上做好質量才宣傳。」控方並問及 Mark Simon 在籌備英文版中的角色。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指據黎在群組中的訊息及其他訊息，他相信 Mark Simon 負責在外國發放消息的渠道，因上述訊息討論英文版如何宣傳，所以黎吩咐同事不用急，先做好文章質素，之後 Mark Simon 會在美國宣傳。Mark Simon 亦會按照黎的指示，邀請美國政要和官員訂閱英文版。此外，黎曾提及 Mark Simon 會介紹一些英文版專欄作家。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又稱，黎曾叫 Mark Simon 到美國找時任副總統彭斯和時任國務卿蓬佩奧訂閱《蘋果》英文版。控方展示黎傳送給 Mark Simon 的訊息：「Imaging if we can get Mike Pence to subscribe to Apple Daily app! The publicity and respect it command would arouse much support for us. I know it’s almost impossible to pull it off. But can try?」（「試想像若果能使彭斯訂閱蘋果，相關宣傳會為我們帶來很多支持，我知這是幾乎沒可能，但可以一試？」）惟張指，由於彭斯和蓬佩奧作為政治人物，他們的訂閱和付費記錄不能公開，所以最終未有成功叫他們訂閱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;英文版揀選中文新聞翻譯-張劍虹形容更加極端&quot;&gt;英文版揀選中文新聞翻譯 張劍虹形容「更加極端」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示另一則訊息，黎在群組中稱，在揀選英文版寫手時不需要囊括不同的政見給外國人知道，只需要集中在《蘋果》的觀點及「黃營」的普遍觀點。（“When we choose writers we don’t have to think about giving foreigners a balanced view of what happens here of every different colors, we only concentrate in our Apple Daily HK view, a general view of the yellow side.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹解釋，因為黎想讓外國人知道「偏黃」的角度。張又指，黎認為揀選寫手時只需要一些「蘋果觀點」和「支持香港」的觀點，而不需要平衡報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，這是否成為了《蘋果》英文版的政策，即是沒有關於中國的正面新聞，只得負面新聞？張確認。李官聞言指，其實《蘋果》中文版亦採用相同政策。張則回應：「英文版仲更加極端好多囉，可以咁講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問何謂「極端」，張指《蘋果》每日均有很多新聞，有的比較中性和生活化，不一定全部都是負面新聞，但《蘋果》英文版會揀選一些中文新聞來翻譯，因而「會負面啲、極端啲」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官續問，就中國而言，黎智英想營造怎樣的形象和帶出怎樣的訊息？張形容：「黎生覺得中國政權係打壓人權，咁喺新冠病毒嘅時候，政權又唔透明呀，隱瞞疫情呀，令到成個疫情擴散至全世界」，所以黎認為要向外國人呈現上述形象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官又問，黎是否對中國有一定看法，然後想將他的看法推銷給外國。張則指，黎的確有上述看法，但他在群組中亦重申「反中情緒係美國最需要嘅，所以佢都因為咁樣而提供多啲呢類新聞俾讀者」，從而「想俾美國有多啲理由去做敵對行動」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎希望英文版影響美國民意-及成為蘋果政治庇護&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎希望英文版影響美國民意 及成為《蘋果》政治庇護&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹早前提及，黎希望《蘋果》英文版「走向美國」，以及成為美國政治的槓桿。李官要求張簡述「美國政治槓桿」的意思，張指以他的理解，黎想影響美國的民意，「從而令美國嘅政治都產生作用」，即希望美國能出手做敵對行動，可以幫助到香港和《蘋果日報》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又展示黎智英傳送給前動新聞平台總監張志偉的訊息：「Patreon 的問題是與蘋果日報隔離，我們主要目的是外國人撐蘋果日報，尤其美國政治人物訂閱蘋果對我們的政治庇護更重要，我仍然認為英文版有需要設在我們 app 內。」張劍虹指黎希望英文版能為《蘋果日報》提供一個重大的政治保護。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張疫情後掀反中情緒-黎認為美國人最需要看反中文章&quot;&gt;張：疫情後掀反中情緒 黎認為美國人最需要看反中文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年5月13日的群組訊息，黎稱：「我越想越覺得英文版應該着重大陸新聞，專題和文章花絮等。在疫情肆虐後掀起的反中情緒，這些是美國人最需要看。」黎又指目標是讓外國人看到《南華早報》上看不到的中國新聞，打破南早的壟斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張解釋，黎認為疫情後掀起反中情緒，所以美國人最需要看到反中文章，最後《蘋果》亦有執行此項編採政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張供稱，其後羅偉光根據黎的指示，於5月13日把揀選文章準則建議書發送至群組。同年5月31日，張志偉發訊息通知群組成員，指英文版蘋果 App page 正式推出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指《蘋果》早於2020年5月25日發表題為「【打國際線】 《蘋果》英文版免費試睇！」文章，宣布英文版面世，要求張澄清《蘋果》英文版確實面世日子。張解釋英文版網站比手機 App 的英文版頁面更早面世，但他已記不起前者確實面世日子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張黎指示加入台灣新聞-冀美國關注中國脅迫台灣&quot;&gt;張：黎指示加入台灣新聞 冀美國關注中國脅迫台灣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年5月19日黎發送給張的訊息：「劍虹，今次中美對峙台在美國戰略上提升，令美國人關注。你認為在香港英文版下面也加插台灣新聞，專題，評論十篇八篇以搞高吸引？謝謝。」張回覆：「老闆，一定需要的。中美大戰，台灣重要，必須要加的。謝謝」，黎回覆：「好，你來策劃，謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問張為何要加入台灣新聞。張供稱，台灣在中美角力戰略上地位提升，變得重要，因中國在軍事和經濟上對台灣脅迫，使全世界特別是美國很關注，亦會令美國更加同情和支援「呢個已經有民主自由的台灣」，而黎認為若果台灣受到保護的話，商人在台灣投資會更加放心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官問張，《蘋果》是否希望為台灣取得更多支持。張表示相信是，亦相信黎想中國脅迫台灣一事得到美國更多關注。李官問是否想將中國置於一個不利位置？張確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，黎發訊息給張，指示他兼任蘋果英文版出版人。張稱他最終沒有成為英文版的出版人，而他負責中文版和英文版《蘋果》的運作，馮偉光則負責揀選新聞來翻譯及統籌英文版作者。不過在架構上，馮偉光是向總編輯羅偉光負責，羅偉光向張志偉負責，張志偉向陳沛敏負責，而陳沛敏則向張劍虹負責。但事實上，如馮有任何問題，很多時會直接聯絡張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，張志偉再向群組發送訊息，通知大家《蘋果》手機應用程式當天在英國上架，英國的讀者可以下載手機應用程式看到《蘋果》英文版，「因英國已脫歐，而其他歐盟國家仍不可以。」張劍虹解釋，由於歐盟國家對於私隱有嚴格規定，手機應用程式不能收集讀者數據，所以他相信除了歐盟成員國之外，其他地方下載《蘋果》手機應用程式也是沒有問題，包括新加坡和美國。張其後補充：「中國⋯⋯我諗應該都唔得。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，張志偉再發送訊息，指將會一連五日逢晚上8時推播（push）《蘋果》文章英文版以作宣傳，又提到：「我們打美國市場，故是香港時間晚上8pm（即美東8pm）出 push。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後張志偉向群組發訊息：「各位，我們蘋果 fb、twitter 和 IG 已出老闆的蘋果英文版宣傳片」，並附上蘋果 Facebook、Twitter、Instagram 和北美蘋果 Facebook 的影片連結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到「北美蘋果」是什麼，張劍虹指「北美蘋果」是一個獨立網站，它將香港和台灣《蘋果》的內容集合在一起，然後在北美地區收取訂閱費用。地區包括美國和加拿大，讀書只要支付月費，便可以閱覽香港和台灣《蘋果》內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英認為live-chat節目好有用-能與有影響力人士談論香港局勢&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英認為Live Chat節目「好有用」 能與有影響力人士談論香港局勢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年6月30日的群組訊息，張志偉稱：「老闆、張生、各位，老闆計劃做的 twitter live，目的是和外國讀者互動，打國際線，我建議以下做法：」，之後列出直播時間、地點、人手和社交媒體等建議。張劍虹其後回覆「是否後天就開始？惡法剛生效」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹解釋，「Twitter Live」是「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」的前身，黎智英想在節目中邀請嘉賓，但張印象中首集節目是沒有嘉賓，僅直播黎演講，若有嘉賓時就直播他們對談。張續指，節目分別在《蘋果》英文版平台、《蘋果》 Twitter 和黎的個人 Twitter 進行直播。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「惡法剛生效」，張指是國安法，又指在當時籌備節目，黎邀請外國知名人士來對談和談論《香港國安法》生效之後的局勢，是希望外國關注香港形勢、提供援助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指 Live Chat 節目的題目由黎決定，而他自己不曾就此參與討論；嘉賓方面，張相信是由黎邀請，因《蘋果》並沒有牽涉邀請嘉賓。張指，約一至兩個月後，他與黎討論這個節目時，「黎生覺得呢啲 Live Chat 好有用，可以同呢啲有影響力嘅人談論香港局勢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問張，為何他在群組中詢問節目開始日子時，會提及《國安法》？張則指「黎生好緊張呢個《國安法》對《蘋果日報》和香港的影響」，因此張想問黎是否想在節目中講述《國安法》和香港的影響。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹指live-chat-節目後期次數較頻密&quot;&gt;張劍虹指Live Chat 節目後期次數較頻密&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2020年7月3日的訊息，張通知群組成員，「蘋果日報北美」的 Facebook 專頁當日正式易名為「Apple Daily - English Edition」，並「會開始出全英文fb po打國際線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問「打國際線」是什麼意思，張回答：「啫係一路以嚟用緊嘅意思。」惟控方並沒有追問下去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2020年7月30日，張志偉向群組發放訊息，指當天 Live Chat 節目的嘉賓是壹傳媒獨立非執行董事 Mark Clifford 和美國在台協會前主席 Raymond Burghardt。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張供稱，起初節目每週播放一次，直至後期11月尾，節目做得較頻密，有時更每週兩次。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方擬播放2020年7月30日的節目片段，片長35分鐘，故申請押後至明日續審，獲法官批准。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（23日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第14日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他稱《蘋果》製作網上對談節目及推行「撐學生訂閱計劃」，目的均是讓年輕人成為《蘋果》讀者，因「黎生好支持年輕人出嚟抗爭啦，好讚揚佢哋為咗保衛家園而犧牲」。張又指黎的編採指示之一是要提倡「和勇不分」，形容黎「瞓身」支持反送中運動，有時遊行目睹一些勇武示威者破壞店舖，「佢唔覺得係咩一回事⋯⋯覺得年輕人好勇，好投入個運動度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹稱網上對談節目冀吸引年輕觀眾&quot;&gt;張劍虹稱網上對談節目冀吸引年輕觀眾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續就2019年下半年的事件提問。就張劍虹上周五提及的《蘋果》網上對談節目，張指觀眾對象是《蘋果日報》的訂戶，因時下年輕人比較少閱讀實體報紙，卻愈來愈傾向透過網上影片去看新聞，所以《蘋果》便側重製作網上影片，希望吸引多些年輕人透過《蘋果》網站得到反送中資訊，讓他們了解及投入運動。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又提到，黎智英於2019年7月赴美會見官員後，似乎比以前較多談論制裁，例如美國通過《香港民主與自由法案》和禁止供應槍械予香港警方，「咁黎生都認為係好嘅，啫係贊成呢啲法案」，之後補充，「啫係（黎）覺得 Trump 真係做嘢囉，唔係得個講字。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指黎冀年輕人成為蘋果忠實讀者-推行撐學生訂閱計劃&quot;&gt;張指黎冀年輕人成為蘋果忠實讀者 推行「撐學生訂閱計劃」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另提到《蘋果》推行的「撐學生訂閱計劃」，庭上展示計劃宣傳圖，顯示受助對象是10至22歲就讀本地學校和大專院校的學生，以及「撐學生，抗暴政」字句。張解釋，《蘋果》呼籲讀者捐款，每捐300元，便可贊助一個學生免費閱覽《蘋果》網站新聞一年。張指計劃於2019年8月中推行，因為「黎生好支持年輕人出嚟抗爭啦，好讚揚佢哋為咗保衛家園而犧牲，亦都希望佢哋成為蘋果忠實讀者，就可以繼續睇到蘋果的新聞」，但黎考慮到很多學生均未有信用卡或經濟能力，所以呼籲市民捐錢，讓他們可以瀏覽《蘋果》網站新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英認為和勇需團結抗爭-見勇武示威者破壞店舖唔覺得係咩一回事&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英認為和勇需團結抗爭 見勇武示威者破壞店舖「唔覺得係咩一回事」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指反送中運動期間，每天都有很多新聞發生，加上「黎生都好瞓身、全力支持呢個運動，每一個遊行，黎生都會自己參與，又會行頭，揸埋旗咁樣」，所以整個港聞組都會很投入地去報導反送中運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bDsTG1T.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黎智英&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示4篇《蘋果》報導，包括〈槍彈狂轟港島 百人受傷被捕 瘋狂警暴迎十·一〉（2019年9月30日）、〈蒙面法掀怒火 全城抗爭還拖〉（2019年10月7日）、〈和變勇 「是政權，逼我進化」〉（2019年10月9日）和〈屠龍隊邊緣呼喚 全民勇武／三罷〉（2019年11月15日）。張確認上述報導均符合黎智英的編採指示，即呼籲市民上街、譴責警方使用暴力鎮壓示威者及提倡「和勇不分」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官關注黎如何理解「和勇不分」，控方遂問到，黎對於「和勇不分」的立場是如何。張指黎認為，「抗爭需要有和同勇嘅人一齊抗爭，係需要團結，個抗爭先會有力量，先會有機會成功，啫係如果分化呢，就會孤立咗一啲激進嘅示威者。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官關注何謂「激進」，是指思想上的「激進」，還是行動上的「激進」。張則指是行動上的「激進」，又補充：「嗰陣時好興架，啫係出嚟暴動呀、打爛啲舖頭呀⋯⋯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰打斷，指現時是想了解黎智英的想法，而非張的想法。張回應，據他所知「佢（黎）係咁諗」，「勇係有行動嘅勇，佢（黎）有時去完遊行呀，講返佢喺遊行見到有啲情況，有啲勇武打爛啲舖頭，佢唔覺得係咩一回事⋯⋯覺得年輕人好勇，好投入個運動度。」李運騰追問，在上述報導之中，受訪者可否被黎視為「勇」？張回答可以。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹稱不能拒絕遵從黎指示&quot;&gt;張劍虹稱不能拒絕遵從黎指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續問，據張記憶所及，他有否曾經不遵從黎的指示，張稱記憶中沒有。控方又問，他能否拒絕遵從黎的指示？張表示不可以。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指，當黎未能如期出席「飯盒會」時，會議可能會改期，或者順延一個星期後才舉行。他又記得黎於2019年10月出門遠行之前，曾特別吩咐他，「如果佢（黎）出門呢，就由我主持」，於是張其後遵照吩咐，每當黎出門遠行時，便由張主持「飯盒會」，事後他會向黎報告會議內容，如果同事有任何意見或問題，張會向黎請示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張黎指示邀請顏純鈎撰寫社論-筆名方圓&quot;&gt;張：黎指示邀請顏純鈎撰寫社論 筆名「方圓」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年4月9日黎與張之間的 WhatsApp 對話，黎稱：「劍虹，你認識顏純釣（鈎）嗎？他文章寫得真好，我想和他見見面。謝謝。黎」，張則稱不認識顏，會託認識顏的人相約。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張解釋，顏純鈎是《蘋果》社論的撰寫人「方圓」真身，由於黎智英認為顏對中共熟悉，所以文章寫得好。張其後經另一名作家李碧華聯絡顏。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示張劍虹與顏純鈎之間的訊息對話，顏表示可以接受每週寫一至三篇，並一度問張：「你就是聞名報界的沙膽虹嗎？」張回覆：「顏先生，見笑見笑。正是小弟。」張亦指每篇社論字數可以500至1,000字，並提議顏先每週固定寫兩篇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，張指筆名「盧峯」的馮偉光和筆名「李平」的楊清奇，均是在黎智英的指示下，負責撰寫《蘋果》社論。張指「李平」主力寫政治及中共為主，而「盧峯」亦主力寫政治，但偶然會寫財經，又指二人的政治立場是「支持民主、自由、人權」，並會批評中國共產黨和「反共」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示兩篇社論例子，包括〈蘋論：反「送中惡法」行動 將無處不在〉（刊於2019年5月13日），由筆名「盧峯」的馮偉光撰寫；以及〈制裁人權惡棍是釜底抽薪 Bring the impact of Magnitsky Human Rights Act into full play〉（刊於2020年6月13日），由筆名「李平」的楊清奇撰寫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，於2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀，請求外國或者境外機構、組織、人員實施對香港特別行政區或者中華人民共和國進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，指黎智英於2020年7月1日至今年2月15日間，與 Mark Simon、陳梓華、李宇軒、劉祖廸及其他人串謀，請求外國或境外機構、組織、人員，實施對中國或香港進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司於2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及/或複製煽動刊物，具意圖：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a) 引起憎恨或藐視中央或香港特別行政區政府或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b) 激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變其他在香港的依法制定的事項&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;c) 引起對香港司法的憎恨、藐視或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;d) 引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;e) 煽惑他人使用暴力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;f) 慫使他人不守法或不服從合法命令。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（23日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第14日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他稱黎替《蘋果》25週年特刊撰文，提到馮睎乾專欄提出開設英文版，黎亦認為：「外國人訂戶越多，政治上或會是種保護」，「越多外國人，政府和政治人物支持我們，越多世界輿論支持和外交關注，我們越能保住法治和自由，外國勢力萬歲！」人大於2020年5月宣布將會實施《港區國安法》，黎隨即指示張推行「一人一信救香港」，呼籲香港人寫信給美國總統、副總統和議員。張指目的是希望「請佢哋出手干預香港呢件事」，例如實施制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英撰文稱外國人訂戶越多政治上或會是種保護-張解釋中共搞蘋果必遭外國制裁&quot;&gt;黎智英撰文稱「外國人訂戶越多，政治上或會是種保護」 張解釋：中共搞蘋果必遭外國制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，張表示2020年正值《蘋果》25週年，當時編採部正籌備一本特刊，並邀請黎智英撰寫一篇感言，放在特刊的最前面。該特刊的內容包括前主管的訪問以及一些圖片，並向公眾發售。控方展示黎智英於2020年5月17日發送給張劍虹的特刊感言草稿，內容包括：「那天看到馮睎乾專欄提出開設英文版之議，我們突然想到：是，外國人要支持香港民主運動，辨法之一是訂閱《蘋果日報》，外國人訂戶越多，政治上或會是種保護。現在中共『打到嚟』了，若是通過廿三條，所有敢言的傳媒關門大吉，境況凶險⋯⋯中共將每個示威，每場抗議都說成是外國勢力⋯⋯將兩百萬香港人說成外國勢力在背後操控的 robots。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問張，文章中提到「外國人訂戶越多，政治上或會是種保護」，當中的「政治保護」是甚麼意思。張解釋：「如果好多人訂閱《蘋果》英文版，中共搞《蘋果》一定會得到外國制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎撰文越多外國人政府和政治人物支持我們我們越能保住法治和自由&quot;&gt;黎撰文：越多外國人，政府和政治人物支持我們，我們越能保住法治和自由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英在文章最後表示：「中共是理直氣壯的。不過他們說謊也理直氣壯的，總之他們永遠是對就是了。對，我們沒有外國勢力，現在卻非外國勢力不可！越多外國人，政府和政治人物支持我們，越多世界輿論支持和外交關注，我們越能保住法治和自由，外國勢力萬歲！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問，上述提到的「外國支持及外國勢力」意指甚麼。張解釋：「講緊外國政治人物、官員訂閱《蘋果日報》」，而他們的支持對《蘋果日報》有「重大嘅政治保護」。張續指：「如果外國政治人物能夠為香港發聲、支持香港，對香港嘅自由同法治好重要，對香港係一種保護。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎指示發動一人一信救香港-促美官員出手干預&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎指示發動「一人一信救香港」 促美官員「出手干預」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年5月22日黎與張之間的 WhatsApp 訊息，當中黎指示：「劍虹，請考慮蘋果日報發動一人一信救香港。」張庭上解釋，由於當時人大宣布將會在香港實施《國安法》，所以黎打電話給他，吩咐他籌備「一人一信救香港」行動，呼籲香港人寫信給美國總統、副總統和議員，希望他們可以「出聲救救香港」，「請佢哋出手干預香港呢件事」，例如實施制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱，他們最後決定由《蘋果》在網上提供一封信件，讀者只需要在信上簽署，便可以透過 Twitter、Facebook 和電郵等方式傳送至時任美國總統特朗普。張又指《蘋果》分別於3天實體報紙刊登「一人一信」行動，此外亦在網站刊登同樣的信件內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;請願信提及國際壓力-張稱意指制裁和其他敵對行動&quot;&gt;請願信提及國際壓力 張稱意指制裁和其他敵對行動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年5月24日的《蘋果日報》頭版，當中有一篇英文信件範本，稱中共實施港區國安法意味取消香港高度自治，也會摧毀香港最寶貴的資產即法治，若果沒有國際壓力和美國的支持，香港將會由一個法治社會變成一個根據「北京法治」運行的地方。信件範本下面附有說明，教導讀者可經三種途徑向特朗普表訴求，包括在 Twitter 註冊帳戶，然後發布已簽署的信件圖片，並標註「#TrumpSavesHK」和「@realDonaldTrump」；亦可到《蘋果》網站複製信件，之後到特朗普的 Facebook 專頁留言；以及網上簽署白宮聯署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指請願信提及國際壓力和美國的堅持，問這是指什麼。張回答：「啫係國際上有壓力，採取敵對行動。」控方追問是什麼敵對行動，張則指：「啫係黎生講嘅 sanction 或其他敵對行動。」法官李運騰一度打斷，提醒張作供時要非常小心，只需憶述黎曾說過的說話，但不要自行作出詮釋。張表示黎的確有使用制裁一字，但不記得是用中文還是英文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英自行指示他人處理一人一信&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英自行指示他人處理「一人一信」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到信件範本是由誰人撰寫，張表示不知道，又補充黎自行安排其他同事撰寫及做設計。張指當日黎要出席法庭聆訊，準備申請取回護照，他自己亦有上庭擔任黎的擔保人，因此他整個早上均沒有時間返回公司，結果是黎自己處理「一人一信救香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張其後表示以他所理解，黎後來指示其助手 Mark Simon 撰寫請願信範本，但他並沒有向黎確認，所以未能肯定。張亦不知道 Mark Simon 在「一人一信救香港」中的角色。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向張劍虹展示 WhatsApp 群組「English news」的對話訊息，時段涵蓋2020年5月10日至8月8日。群組成員包括黎智英、張劍虹、前動新聞平台總監張志偉、前副社長陳沛敏、前總編輯羅偉光、前英文版主筆馮偉光、兩岸版的副總編輯蔣美紅和資訊科技部主管 Connie Chan。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審，將繼續談及《蘋果》英文版。&lt;/p&gt;

While the two countries enjoy a near-unbreakable bilateral relationship and close political ties, there has been an ongoing intelligence war between the two since the Islamic Revolution in Tehran.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few days have seen global headlines focused on the tit-for-tat airstrikes between Iran and Pakistan. There has been speculation about an Iranian escalation and a wider Middle Eastern conflict that might suck in the Pakistani military. To be clear, no such scenario is on the cards. Iran and Pakistan are already deescalating, with both sides stating a lack of interest in harming their “brotherly ties”. However, a clear violation has been committed by both countries, initiated by Iran, and there is historical bad blood when it comes to the Baluch border, with both sides backing each other’s respective proxies. Friction between the two countries has also been raised by competition for control and influence in Afghanistan, overt Pakistani support for Azerbaijan, and Iran’s recruitment of Shia fighters from Pakistan to fight in the Middle East. While the two have not engaged directly in open conflict in the Middle East, there have been numerous irregular small wars between Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-shahs-steadying-hand-to-support-a-young-pakistani-state&quot;&gt;The Shah’s Steadying Hand to Support a Young Pakistani State&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long before 1979, the Shah of Iran had been one of Pakistan’s foremost backers against a much larger India. Indeed, the Shah even threatened to attack India if it went beyond its remit when it came to attacking East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in 1971. The Shah along with Jordan and Syria were the only countries in the Islamic world that helped Pakistan with military hardware, intelligence and logistics. All of this is described in some detail in a lucid account by the Shah’s chief courtier, Assadollah Alam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Baluchistan, which has seen numerous insurgencies sponsored by India and Afghanistan, was always a sore point for the Shah. Iranian jets and military helicopters used to be based in Pakistan while hunting Baluch and Afghan insurgents on both sides of the Iran–Pakistan border. The Shah also repeatedly batted for Pakistan, convincing Nixon and Kissinger to go all the way in supporting Pakistan against the Indians in the 1971 war. In fact, Kissinger’s first trip to Pakistan was to study the Baluch insurgency and its impact on US–Persian Gulf security relations. Both Roham Alvandi’s Nixon, Kissinger and the Shah and Alex Vatanka’s Iran and Pakistan go into some detail about the US influence on the Pakistan–Iran joint strategy for security partnerships to protect the Persian Gulf and South Asia from Soviet designs. Baluchistan was central to the security partnership that had endured since 1947, and the Shah was resolute in protecting a young and inexperienced Pakistani state from implosion, especially after the loss of East Pakistan. However, after the ousting of the Shah by Islamic hardliners in 1979, the ebb and flow between Iran and Pakistan began to change for the worse, with an increasing hostility between the two and the convergence over Baluchistan becoming a divergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tehrans-export-of-its-revolution-and-changing-tides&quot;&gt;Tehran’s Export of Its Revolution and Changing Tides&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the early years of the Iranian revolution, the two sides continued to maintain close relations and to cooperate on security issues. Pakistan was pivotal in ending the Iran–Iraq war, with former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani mentioning in his memoirs that along with Syria, Pakistan played a key role as an arbitrator between Tehran and the Saudi-backed coalition led by Saddam Hussein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, ties began to worsen after the Soviets left Afghanistan in 1989, as various proxies in the country began to aim their guns at each other. Iran favoured the Shia-dominated warring parties, while the Saudis and Pakistan backed the Sunnis. Before the emergence of the Taliban, the Iranians had already begun to support Shia groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan to challenge a growing Saudi madrassa movement which had been spawned by the Afghan war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1990s and early 2000s also saw a peak in the power and strength of Saudi-funded groups in Pakistan, culminating in multiple bombings and the targeting of Shia mosques and prominent Shia figures. The Iranian consulate in Peshawar was attacked twice, and a senior diplomat was also kidnapped in the same city in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A clear violation has been committed by both countries, initiated by Iran, and there is historical bad blood when it comes to the Baluch border, with both sides backing each other’s respective proxies&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the use of proxies was a two-way street, and Tehran allegedly had a hand in attacking the Saudi consulate in Karachi. The Pakistanis had not been comfortable with the Iranian-Indian alliance in Afghanistan, which was seen as a direct attempt to undermine both Baluchistan and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. Iran’s cooperation with India over the port of Chabahar (bypassing Pakistan) is also seen by Pakistan as a threat to its own port of Gwadar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of Pakistani Shia fighters in Syria and Iraq was another red line that  crossed by Iran. This took the competition firmly into the sectarian realm, with the risk that thousands of battle-hardened Shia would return to cause havoc in Pakistan, and has upset the status quo in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 2020, Javad Zarif, the then Iranian foreign minister, said that Shia fighters could be used to stabilise Afghanistan and Pakistan. This caused considerable anger in both countries, but showed the Iranian desire to dominate by using proxies to fight local civil wars and to provoke ethnic and sectarian strife. The Saudis have also shown an increasing mistrust of Iranian involvement and influence in domestic Pakistani politics that has bordered on purely sectarian lines. Further evidence of this emerged when one of the former president’s right-hand men confessed to spying on the Pakistani military on behalf of the Iranians, with political cover provided by a party the Saudis had always suspected of being pro-Iranian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-india-factor-and-super-spies&quot;&gt;The India Factor and Super Spies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the new Afghan Republic also pulled closer to India and Iran when it came to trying to isolate Pakistani influence in Afghanistan. In contrast to the Shah’s time when Iran ensured that India kept out of Baluchistan and Afghanistan, Tehran now welcomed India in both Afghanistan and Baluchistan owing to its desire to weaken the Pakistanis’ grip over Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of the Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav, captured in Iran by the ISI, has led many in Pakistan to suspect that the Iranians have tolerated Indian spies in sensitive Baluch areas, thereby confirming an Iran–India partnership to trap Pakistan. However, the Indians firmly believed that the ISI had used its own Baluch agents to capture Jadhav deep inside Iranian territory. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made no secret of his desire to raise the temperature in Baluchistan to test Pakistani defences and nerves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popular film Kandahar, released last year, portrays a four-way battle on the Iran–Afghanistan–Pakistan border between Pakistani, Indian, US and Iranian intelligence agencies to solidify gains in the Afghan endgame. The Great Game for control of Central Asia has now morphed into an all-out battle between regional players in Afghanistan, as opposed to the Russians and the British of the 19th century. India has even moved into Kabul and established friendly relations with the Taliban, in stark contrast to its entrenched enmity with the group in the 1990s. Iran and India have both cornered Pakistan by doing a U-turn on their ties with the Taliban, ensuring that the ISI can no longer use the group against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;geopolitics-trumps-sectarianism&quot;&gt;Geopolitics Trumps Sectarianism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the use of significant sectarian elements by both sides in the pursuit of strategic and tactical intelligence wins, this fight is by and large about power and influence, from Baluchistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan all the way to the Caucasus. Pakistan has closely supported Shia-majority Azerbaijan in its fight against Iranian-backed Armenia. Moreover, Pakistan has had multiple Shia Chiefs of Army Staff and a significant number of Shia generals, and so it is clear that in their military calculus, there is no room for sectarian-influenced decisions. Wajahat S Khan of the Atlantic Council, Pakistan’s foremost defence journalist, also believes that Iran and Pakistan are engaged in extensive geopolitical competition in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Notwithstanding the use of significant sectarian elements by both sides, this fight is by and large about power and influence, from Baluchistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan all the way to the Caucasus&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in contrast to an almost war-like situation with the Taliban in the 1990s, Tehran is now heavily embedded in the Taliban’s return to power despite the group’s heavy Sunni tilt, with little or no room for Shia minorities in its leadership. The Iranians began recalibrating their previous animosity towards the Taliban by hosting senior Taliban and Al-Qa’ida leaders who were on the run. A lot of this was done out of necessity in order to balance against the Pakistanis and to widen mistrust between Pakistan and the US during their joint quest for an amicable balance of power in 2021. The killing of the Taliban leader Mullah Mansour in 2016 in a drone strike was viewed with suspicion by the Pakistani military, given that Mansour had just crossed the border from Iran into Pakistan. Pakistan alleged that Iran and the US had colluded in making Pakistan the fall guy once again, when in fact the Taliban were now also being supported fully by Tehran. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, another former Sunni strongman in Afghanistan who was previously a favourite of Pakistan’s, subsequently fled to Iran and became its ally against the US. Iran and Pakistan both used him against each other, with his presence in Kabul after his return during Ashraf Ghani’s government making him a major asset in the ongoing intelligence war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major General Sahibzada Isfandiyar Pataudi (Retired), a former Director General of the ISI, told me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There has been an intelligence failure in Iran that has caused a disproportionate response and a violent lashing out in all directions – particularly so in Pakistan’s case – which has been immature and unnecessary. I would not put a sectarian twist on it, nor would I suggest a Cold War-type situation. I do believe, however, believe that Pakistan’s measured response shows our resolve to deal with any violation of our sovereignty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both countries have already restored their diplomatic channels, and their ambassadors will be returning to each other’s capitals very soon. There will not be a further escalation. However, from Karachi to Baluchistan and all the way to the Caucasus, both are waging a covert war for influence and leverage against each other in the modern-day Great Game.&lt;/p&gt;

Given the failure of government reforms, private sector distribution has proven to be a promising solution to improve the operational and financial performance of electricity distribution companies (discoms). This report provides a road map for energy officials looking to introduce private participation in the distribution sector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A June 2022 Reserve Bank of India Bulletin put discom health as a significant financial risk to state finances. States such as Punjab and Rajasthan have a staggering total debt-to-GDP ratio of 51 percent and 39 percent, respectively. Discom debt inhibits the states’ ability to spend on other key areas such as health and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While accruing massive losses, discoms are unable to provide reasonably priced and reliable electricity to meet growing industrial demands. Industrial consumers in India often pay tariffs that are 50 percent higher than residential consumers, due to the provision of cross subsidies, where commercial and industrial (C&amp;amp;I) consumers pay higher tariffs to subsidize residential and agricultural consumers. Prices are also not competitive when compared with other countries — Indian C&amp;amp;I electricity tariffs are respectively 30 percent and 37.5 percent higher than in the United States, when adjusted on a purchasing power basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognizant that welfare redistribution policies (such as the provision of free electricity) and a complex regulatory environment have affected discom health, the government has attempted to reform the sector, but this has had limited impact. Even in 2022, states like Uttar Pradesh had a massive aggregate technical and commercial (AT&amp;amp;C) loss rate of 30 percent. As per the annual ratings of discom performance released by the Power Finance Corporation (PFC), most public sector discoms rank low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As underlined by the consistent high performance of private discoms in India, private sector participation is a promising solution for reforming the distribution space. However, state governments often promise free or low-cost electric power as a political tool — which limits the effective operation of public sector discoms. The political economy considerations during tariff setting often overshadows the actual economics. Given how politicized the electricity sector is, privatization has its challenges. But newer experiments with private electricity distribution continue to improve the model and present new opportunities for states that are otherwise unable to make significant, enduring improvements to their state-owned utilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report proposes a road map for state governments interested in undertaking discom privatization. The authors interviewed various government and private sector officials to identify challenges and opportunities based on their experiences. Discom privatization is also politically sensitive, since there is an underlying belief that it has a negative impact on electoral performance. The authors analyzed election data to test this, finding that contrary to popular belief, privatization has no effect on average voting patterns: the average percentage of incumbents voted out of power remains largely consistent in constituencies with private distribution when compared to the state average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian states have been called “laboratories for reform.” With discom privatization, models are adapting, improving, and succeeding on a range of critical measures, such as reduced AT&amp;amp;C losses and improved billing and collection. These lessons need to be shared and further improved to ensure that every Indian citizen and business has access to reliable, clean, and reasonably priced electric power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s path to a $5 trillion economy will be paved with significant developments in its ability to expand manufacturing and accommodate continued urbanization. Additionally, India’s leadership in climate change mitigation will be important for ensuring a low-carbon future for the world. To promote equitable growth, India will also need to pay attention to social development. India’s power distribution sector is the common thread combining all three of these key priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the power distribution sector is rife with challenges — including political interference, unreliable supply, fiscal mismanagement, and lack of capital expenditure. Despite various government attempts, accumulated discom deficit grew from $45.8 billion in 2016 to $74.4 billion in FY 2022. However, government efforts have led to positive momentum. The total amount that discoms owe to power generation companies has gone down from $12 billion in May 2022 to $2.7 billion in October 2023. Despite progress, there is still a long way to go. Private sector discoms have shown merit and could be part of a state government’s tool kit to bring sustainable reforms to the distribution sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this report, the authors present a road map for state officials interested in pursuing discom privatization. The road map is compiled through interviews with private and government stakeholders and is meant to guide officials at various stages of discom privatization, including the pre-bidding, bidding, and post-bidding phases. Learning from the experiences of stakeholders who have been involved in the privatization process can be beneficial to other state governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is the third-largest electricity producer in the world, producing 1.6 million gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity in 2022. However, this is modest compared to China’s 8.8 million GWh and the United States’ 4.5 million GWh. India’s per capita consumption conveys a more dire scenario. In 2021–2022, India’s per capita consumption of 1,255 kilowatt hours (kWh) was a third of the global average, just 11 percent of the United States’ 11,756 kWh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India ranks low even among peer developing nations. For instance, Brazil’s per capita consumption is 2,524 kWh, South Africa’s per capita consumption is 3,406 kWh, and Mexico’s per capita consumption is 2,110 kWh. Tariffs for commercial and industrial (C&amp;amp;I) users are high — Indian C&amp;amp;I users are charged 30 and 37.5 percent higher tariffs than their counterparts in the United States, when adjusted for purchasing power parity. Industrial consumers also pay 12.5 percent higher than the global average. Transmission and distribution (T&amp;amp;D) losses in India stand at 19.2 percent as of 2022 — four times higher than the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite challenges, India’s generation capacity has grown from 160 GW in 2006 to 425.4 GW as of September 2023, with renewable energy generation being a significant component of this growth. To continue along this pathway, the sector must become more financially viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discom health in the country has been a hindrance to India’s growth story. Rather than providing a much-needed enabling infrastructure, the sector has stressed Indian states’ finances and caused problems for large-scale manufacturing development. A Reserve Bank of India bulletin from June 2022 put discom health as a major financial risk to state finances. Practices such as providing free and low-cost electricity to agricultural consumers are theoretically funded by the cross-subsidization of industrial consumers, thereby increasing the latter’s electricity rates — which sometimes reach as high as 15 times the price of agricultural tariffs. Industrial consumers also pay 12.5 percent higher than the global average, which jumps to a striking 37.5 percent higher when contrasted to consumers in the United States. Despite this, cross-subsidization is a half measure, and most state discoms lose money — reducing fiscal space for capital investments and resulting in intermittent power losses and reduced investment in modernizing generation capacity. Even after multiple rounds of government subsidy and debt restructuring, discoms need to rely on fresh tranches of borrowing from the state and central governments to cover operational and debt servicing expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central government has introduced several initiatives to help state discoms improve operations and commercial performance. These include the Accelerated Power Development &amp;amp; Reforms Programme (APDRP), the Revamped Accelerated Power Development &amp;amp; Reforms Programme (R-APDRP), and the Ujjwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY). The results of these programs have been mixed. A 2019 report from NITI Aayog and CRISIL notes that even as UDAY directed states to assume 75 percent of discom debt, discoms did not improve their operational efficiency substantially. In a 2018 assessment of the UDAY scheme conducted by the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), authors further noted that the scheme failed to bring down the AT&amp;amp;C rates or the ACS-ARR gaps to the desired levels. The AT&amp;amp;C rates for state-owned discoms covered under the UDAY scheme have gone down from 26 percent in 2015 to 20.8 percent in 2023. The scheme envisaged to reduce AT&amp;amp;C losses to 15 percent by 2019. Additionally, the ACS-ARR gap in UDAY states has increased from ₹0.54 ($0.0065) in 2015 to ₹1 ($0.012) in 2023. The scheme aimed to bring it down to 0 by 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;discom-privatization&quot;&gt;Discom Privatization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening up the sector to private players has shown merit and should be seriously considered by a larger number of state governments. This report looks at India’s experience with private distribution of electricity, compiling findings from surveys of existing stakeholders to assess the privatization model and provide a road map for states wishing to open their distribution sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant state-level reforms must be viewed through a political lens, as well as through their impact on socioeconomic development. The authors consequently looked at voting trends in the states, cities, and districts that have shifted toward private electricity distribution to scan for patterns that may be related to this reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-are-discoms-important&quot;&gt;Why Are Discoms Important?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to reliable, reasonably priced electric power is critical for India’s national economic development. This is underlined by the stark differences in energy consumption between developed and developing countries. For instance, in 2019, North America’s per capita energy consumption was 5.6 tons of oil equivalent (toe), as opposed to 1.5 toe per capita for the Asia-Pacific region, 1.4 toe per capita for South and Central America, and 1.3 toe per capita for Africa. Consumption of countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is 4.1 toe per capita as opposed to non-OECD countries’ 1.6 toe per capita. Additionally, the energy consumption in developed countries is 2.6 times higher than in developing countries. For reference, India’s energy consumption in 2021 was 0.7 toe per capita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6pFQUS3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Regional Energy Consumption per Capita (Tons of oil equivalent).&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research based on multiple sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy consumption and electrification are causally proven to have a direct impact on several economic and social development metrics. Growth is led by an increase in productivity, profitability, job creation, and macroeconomic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, a study published by the University of Mannheim in 2018 ascertained that increased electrification led to industrial growth in Indonesia between 1990 and 2000. Additionally, an extension of grid networks to new locations attracted new firms to that location, thereby stimulating local economies and promoting job growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research from the World Bank shows that electricity outages also reduce the likelihood of a skilled individual gaining employment by 35 to 41 percent and being self-employed by 32 to 47 percent. Evidence also indicates that the increased cost of electricity hurts the profit margins of small and medium-sized businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electricity access has a direct, positive impact on human development. A study published by the American Economic Association looked at the impact of electrification on employment in South Africa. The study found that electrification leads to the development of microenterprises by releasing women from home production. This leads to higher female employment within five years. A case study conducted in northwestern Madagascar further noted that electrification allows students to complete their schoolwork in the evenings and thereby perform better. This leads to improved educational outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A review of low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) found that household electrification significantly improves health outcomes, as residents can replace biomass fuels for cooking with electricity. A study of 750,000 households in Ecuador that replaced gas with electric stoves found that electric stoves led to a decline in hospitalization due to respiratory illnesses. Given that currently 2.5 billion people do not have access to clean cooking fuels around the world, electrification for cooking can have substantial health and environmental effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;india-overview&quot;&gt;India Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a significant expansion of electricity generation in India, distribution poses significant challenges. Electricity consumption in India has grown threefold since 1991 and is expected to triple again by 2050. Yet, studies from the World Economic Forum (WEF) indicate that per capita electricity consumption in the country remains lower than in Africa. Additionally, estimates show that despite massive gains in the number of households with access to grid electricity, consistent and reliable supply remains a challenge. A research study conducted by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) in 2020 indicated that 76 percent of households in India faced unanticipated power supply interruptions, and up to 66 percent of rural households and 40 percent of urban households faced outages at least once a day. Improving reliable electricity access requires investments aimed at improving the technical capabilities of the distribution network. Therefore, it is crucial to invest in a healthy distribution network to ensure reliable electricity access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improved electricity distribution and access in India would positively affect three areas: industrial growth, renewable energy adoption, and social development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;industrial-growth&quot;&gt;Industrial Growth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy access to reliable, reasonably priced electricity is important for industrialization. The price and access to power for industrial consumers remain a challenge in India, with Indian business consumers paying 50 percent higher tariffs than residential consumers on average due to the practice of cross-subsidization. According to a report by the International Energy Agency, the annual average wholesale electricity prices in India are comparable to those in the United States, despite the stark difference in the size of the economies and the per capita GDP. This hinders the competitiveness of Indian firms, as well as India’s ability to attract international companies to set up manufacturing units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High price, however, is just one piece of the puzzle. Other factors such as outages, low voltage, and lack of access also pose challenges to industrial growth. Research indicates that power outages lead to lower productivity, cost competitiveness, and investment decisions for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Given that SMEs form a significant chunk of Indian firms, this has dire impacts. Additional research also indicates that electricity consumption leads to growth in manufacturing in the short run and ultimately leads to GDP growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;renewable-energy-adoption&quot;&gt;Renewable Energy Adoption&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A report from the International Energy Agency titled India Energy Outlook 2021 shows that between 2019 and 2040, India could account for a quarter of global energy demand growth. This, combined with the fact that India’s carbon emissions have grown faster than its energy demand since 2000, underlines the importance of green energy growth. The government has made several reforms to promote renewable energy and has announced a target of adopting 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030, not counting additional generation required for the National Green Hydrogen Mission. India has also announced a commitment to reach “net zero” carbon emissions by 2070. However, renewable energy adoption does not solely rely on installed generation capacity. Reliable storage infrastructure, as well as distribution and transmission mechanisms, are fundamental to the deployment of the renewable energy generated. Renewable energy adoption requires the integration of renewables into the national grid, which in turn can only be achieved through substantial capital investments. Given the poor financial health of discoms, this is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A report by the Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) posits that India failing to integrate renewables into the grid could lead to a situation like in Germany — where, despite hefty renewable production investment, the cost of electricity for residents grew and 78 percent of total primary energy demand was still being met by fossil fuels as of 2020. The TERI report underlines three major challenges to grid integration: the seasonal nature of renewables, storage systems, and variability in energy generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the root of it, India’s current infrastructure is not equipped to deal with frequent mismatches between energy supply and demand. Discoms need to be financially viable to be able to adopt better technology, assess demand and supply, and plan power purchases in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;social-development&quot;&gt;Social Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy access and efficient distribution is shown to affect various development parameters in India. For instance, the Economic Survey 2020 released by the Ministry of Finance noted that increased access to electricity positively impacts literacy rates in the country, which in turn increases household GDP. Another report by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Human Resource Development for 2020–2021 noted that despite a significant increase in household access to electricity, only 56.5 percent of government schools had access. The lack of reliable electricity distribution is a deterrent to access in government schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electricity access is also important for the provision of healthcare services. A systematic review of studies from African countries, Fiji, and India found that electrification has a positive impact on health outcomes in LMICs. The review found that electrification is associated with improvements in antenatal care, vaccination rates, emergency services, and primary health services. Additionally, better refrigeration also leads to improved pharmaceutical supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A World Bank and World Health Organization report from January 2023 notes the importance of electricity access for universal health coverage. Additionally, the report underlines that electricity access is necessary for vaccine storage, provision of pediatric care, and emergency services. A June 2022 report by EY and the SED Fund states that as per the Rural Health Statistics, 26.3 percent of rural sub-centers and 4.8 percent of primary health centers (PHCs) in India do not have access to electricity supply as of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2021 survey conducted by the Council for Environment and Energy Development and the Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation found that 64.5 percent of health sub-centers in Bihar do not have proper access to electric supply. Moreover, 44 percent of health sub-centers suffer from problems with fluctuation, and 55 percent need to rely on backup power (through generator sets) for more than five hours daily. This adversely impacts health outcomes at the facilities. In line with this, a study conducted by the CEEW and Oxfam on the adoption of solar energy for primary healthcare centers in Chhattisgarh indicated that using solar energy significantly improved outcomes by providing health centers uninhibited access to electricity. The study reported that facilities with solar energy treated 50 percent more outpatients monthly and had 50 percent higher deliveries than those without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uninterrupted power supply also has a positive impact on improving irrigation. Currently, several states in India offer free electricity for irrigation. However, the timing of electricity supply is sporadic, and it is dependent on off-peak hour availability. This results in farmers employing flood irrigation techniques, which are both energy- and water-intensive. Studies in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra have shown that using drip irrigation can result in saving 45 percent of the electricity used for agriculture. Drip irrigation, in turn, is most effective with an uninterrupted electricity supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A systematic review of studies conducted by the Asian Development Bank in August 2020 also stated that improved access to electricity led to marginal improvements in decisionmaking powers and better individual agency for females in a household. Cognizant of the positive socioeconomic impacts of electricity access, the central government launched the “Saubhagya” scheme in 2017, aiming to achieve universal household electrification. As of 2023, over 28 million households have been electrified under the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;indias-history-with-electricity-distribution-reform&quot;&gt;India’s History with Electricity Distribution Reform&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government recognizes the importance of a strong electricity sector and discom health for India’s development. Therefore, there have been multiple attempts to reform the sector. These attempts have had mixed success at best (see Appendix 1 for details).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1995, in the face of consistently poor sectoral performance, the Odisha government introduced the Odisha Electricity Reforms Act. The act unbundled the State Electricity Board, aiming to promote corporatization and attract private investment. Soon after, in 1996, a meeting of all state chief ministers was convened. At the meeting, the group released the Common Minimum National Action Plan for Power, which sought to address the lack of transparency in tariff setting. In this context, the 1998 Electricity Regulatory Commission Act was introduced to create the State Electricity Regulatory Commission with the power to set tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poor performance of state power utilities persisted, however, and in response the central government launched the Accelerated Power Development Programme Scheme (APDP) in 2001. Despite the scheme’s momentum, discom performance remained poor, leading to the government intervening and bailing out State Electricity Boards by infusing $7.4 billion. In 2003, the Electricity Act established central as well as state-level regulatory bodies for the rationalization of tariffs and subsidies. The act also introduced the concept of distribution franchising, leading to several states introducing the model. The same year, the government introduced the Accelerated Power Development Reforms Programme to tie subsidy disbursal with reform progress — in vain. This was followed by the Restructured Accelerated Power Development Reforms Program (R-APDP), which focused on urban areas. This also had limited success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Modi took office in May 2014. His government’s first scheme addressing power sector reforms was the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY) 2015, which aimed to reduce AT&amp;amp;C losses to 15 percent and the ACS-ARR gap to 0. The scheme had limited success: the AT&amp;amp;C losses did go down but only to 20 percent, and the ACS-ARR gap reduced to ₹0.3 paise by 2019. In 2022, the government launched the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) with a total outlay of $37 billion. The scheme aims to bring down the AT&amp;amp;C losses to 12–15 percent, and it sets a new target for bringing the ACS-ARR gap to 0 by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-status&quot;&gt;Current Status&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite government measures, poor discom performance in India has remained a major hindrance to growth. According to a recent report, over 15 years (through 2021), public discoms in India suffered a cash-basis loss of approximately $120 billion. As noted above, dismal discom performance stresses state finances and affects economic and social development. While there has been some improvement in the past few years, this remains marginal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable reforms brought in by the Modi government include the aforementioned UDAY and RDSS programs and the more recent Late Payment Surcharge Rules. Additionally, the government has introduced the Draft Electricity Amendment Bill, 2022, which seeks to ease the entry of private players in the distribution sector and rationalize energy tariffs to reflect actual incurred costs. The bill has not passed the houses yet. The government has also made several efforts to promote corporate governance through guidelines for management and energy accounting. Dashboards such as Payment Ratification and Analyzing Power Procurement for Bringing Transparency in Invoicing of Generators (PRAAPTI) and UDAY have made data on discom performance accessible for stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has yielded positive yet limited results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current performance of the distribution companies can be assessed through the Annual Integrated Rankings and Ratings of Discoms published by the Power Finance Corporation. The 11th edition of the report highlights discom performance during FY 2022. According to the report, AT&amp;amp;C losses have come down from 25.48 percent in 2012 to 16.5 percent in 2022, and 25 Indian states improved their AT&amp;amp;C rates between 2020 and 2022 (see Appendix 2 for details). Specifically, the AT&amp;amp;C rates for state-owned discoms have gone down from 26 percent in 2015 to 20.8 percent in 2023. Additionally, the ACS-ARR gap has come down from $0.01 per unit in 2012 to $0.0049 per unit in 2022 for all discoms. State-owned discoms have an ACS-ARR gap of $0.012, which is holding steady through 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s total power generation capacity grew from 156 GW in 2010 to 425.4 GW as of September 2023. During this time, the total power deficit went down from -10.1 percent to -0.4 percent. Out of this, 169 GW came from renewable energy sources as of March 2023. Notably, access to electricity in India grew to 97 percent by 2023, comprising 95 percent access for rural households and 99 percent access for urban households, according to the National Family Health Survey 5. In comparison, as of 2018, in the United States and China 100 percent of households have access to electricity; 99.6 percent of households in Brazil have access to electricity; and for neighboring Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, household electrification stands at 76.5 percent and 100 percent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;indias-tryst-with-private-electricity-distribution&quot;&gt;India’s Tryst with Private Electricity Distribution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-1&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 70 power distribution companies in India. Of these, 54 are public sector units and 16 are privately owned and are given private licenses for operations. Additionally, there are eight operational power distribution “franchises” that are technically owned by the public sector units but are operationally run by private sector companies on contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The licensed private distribution companies are spread across eight states and union territories including Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Delhi, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. Out of this, six utilities are run by Tata Power, four utilities are run by Torrent Power, two are run by Reliance Infrastructure, two are run by the RP Sanjiv Goenka group-owned Calcutta Electrical Supply Corporation Limited (CESC), and one each is run by Adani Electricity and India Power Corporation Limited. Pockets in Mumbai and Kolkata have had private sector distribution predating state electricity boards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several companies operate distribution utilities on behalf of public sector distribution companies on a contractual basis, as “franchises.” Three states have franchises: Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. There are eight existing franchises, out of which three are run by Torrent Power, four by CESC, and one by Tata Power. Additionally, Torrent Power has applied to get distribution licenses in Nagpur, Pune, and Thane in Maharashtra, whereas CESC has a pending contract to operate the distribution utility in Chandigarh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether, private sector companies serve a total of approximately 28 million customers across the country. Out of these, licensed operators serve about 26 million customers, whereas franchised providers serve the remaining 2 million customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Private Distribution Companies with Ongoing Operations.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research based on multiple sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;history-and-current-status&quot;&gt;History and Current Status&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector distribution is not entirely new for India. India’s first power distribution company, CESC, was established in 1897 as an electric light provider for Kolkata (then Calcutta). The company received a distribution license from the government of West Bengal in 1978.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the real impetus toward privatization came in 1995 through the Odisha Electricity Reforms Act. The act was ushered in due to mounting pressure from the World Bank in the face of consistently poor performance by the State Electricity Board. It initiated the corporatization and unbundling of the public sector utility, ultimately carving the distribution network into four zones that were licensed to two private distribution companies: Applied Energy Services (AES) and Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Limited (BSES).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Odisha’s initial experiment with private discoms was short-lived. Firms reported higher losses after privatization. This was accredited to poor baseline accounting and weak operational data provided by the government. Notably, reform attempts such as curbing electricity theft, reforming agricultural tariff, and managing labor unions were contentious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A catastrophic cyclone in Odisha in 1999 proved to be the final straw in the deteriorating situation of the state’s newly privatized central discoms. The cyclone caused massive infrastructural damage. World Bank funds earmarked for demand-side management and meter acquisition could not be repurposed for construction work. This ultimately led to the exiting of private firms from Odisha by early 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delhi decided to open the door to distribution privatization around the same time. By 2001, Delhi had divided its power distribution into three sectoral zones; two of these zones were awarded to BSES, with the third awarded to Tata Power. In 2003, Reliance Industries increased their 20 percent minority stake in BSES-held utilities to 58 percent to take full control of the company. Delhi decided to introduce privatization through a public-private partnership (PPP) model where the government would retain a minority stake. The three utilities still operate in Delhi and have considerably improved operational and financial efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite positive signs from privatized utilities, electoral considerations stemming from potentially higher power tariffs evoked a lukewarm response from the state governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This changed after the introduction of the Electricity Act, 2003. The Electricity Act paved the way for opening the power distribution sector to private players. Sensitive to the political considerations of state governments, it offered a third way wherein the governments could pass off the operations of running a distribution company to the private sector while still retaining ownership, thereby creating the franchising model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2007, when giving a franchise for managing power distribution for Bhiwandi to Torrent Power, Maharashtra became the first state in the country to experiment with the franchise model. Torrent was able to dramatically reduce the AT&amp;amp;C losses in Bhiwandi from 58 percent in 2007 to 22.36 percent in 2014, and this was further reduced to 9.8 percent in 2022. The franchise is still operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Odisha’s experiment with franchising started in 2013, when the government gave franchising of five select zones to Shyam Indus, Feedback Energy Distribution Company (FEDCO), and Enzen Global. The experiment, however, was less successful. Since then, 17 other regions have opened power distribution operations to the franchising model. As of April 2023, out of the 23 cases total, 15 had ceased operations; mismatch between government expectations and outcomes, as well as labor unions, have been cited as the cause. States have experimented with different models of franchises such as input-based, investment-based, and input-based with incremental revenue (IBF-IRS); however, experiences have been widely varied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;private-sector-distribution-performance&quot;&gt;Private Sector Distribution Performance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barring a few exceptions, private sector companies have consistently been able to improve operational efficiency as noted by decreasing AT&amp;amp;C losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list below compiles the AT&amp;amp;C losses of private sector distribution companies. The first year (Y1) is the base year and indicates the losses when the utility was taken over by the private sector distribution company. For comparison, the authors have provided the AT&amp;amp;C losses after five years of the company taking over operations (Y5). In places where applicable, they have also listed the latest data on AT&amp;amp;C losses for FY 2022. Additionally, in relevant cases, the table presents the state average AT&amp;amp;C losses to provide a baseline comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qK2IPHs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 3: AT&amp;amp;C Rates of Private Distribution Providers.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research based on multiple sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, licensed private distribution companies have been able to dramatically reduce AT&amp;amp;C losses. For instance, BSES Yamuna has reduced AT&amp;amp;C losses from 60.6 percent in 2001 to 7.06 percent in 2022. BSES Rajdhani reduced losses from 49.6 percent at the time of takeover in 2001 to 7.7 percent in 2022. The most impressive loss reduction, however, has been led by Tata Power Delhi, which went from 48.1 percent in 2001 to merely 6 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, all franchised operations have also been able to reduce AT&amp;amp;C losses. The most impressive performance was by Torrent Power in their Shil-Mumbra Kalwa franchise in Maharashtra. Over three years of operation, AT&amp;amp;C losses have reduced at an average rate of 17.5 percent per annum. Torrent Power’s Bhiwandi franchise follows closely, as it was able to reduce losses by 9.7 percent per annum over the first five years of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;politics-of-discoms&quot;&gt;Politics of Discoms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In India, politics and electricity are deeply intertwined. In the early 1970s, then prime minister Indira Gandhi created a power tariff that provided virtually free electricity to farmers. In the 1977 Andhra Pradesh state elections, Congress introduced flat tariffs and electricity subsidies for farmers. The All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), which had just come to power in a highly contested election in Tamil Nadu, followed suit. In 1989, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) — a competing party in Tamil Nadu — promised free electricity to farmers in its election manifesto. After coming to power, the DMK issued an order to provide free electricity for agricultural pumps. This was followed by a series of power subsidies to different categories by both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thereafter, the promise of free or cheap electricity gained momentum as a political platform. With the emergence of the farming classes as a voter bloc in the country, Maharashtra and Punjab soon adopted the strategy, precipitating a nationwide cascade. In 2004, Andhra Pradesh announced free electricity to farmers. Additionally, research from the University of Michigan has shown that electricity is used as a political plank to influence voters in Uttar Pradesh. There was a resurgence of using free electricity as an electoral tool in 2015, when the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) slashed power tariffs by 50 percent for consumers using up to 400 units per month in Delhi. In 2019, electricity was made free for users utilizing up to 200 units per month. AAP swept the 2020 Delhi state election polls. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Bharatiya Janata Party in Haryana used electricity price as a tool to appease voters — prices were slashed in the year leading up to the elections. In 2022, AAP came to power in Punjab on the promise of free electricity up to 300 units per month. Even as recently as 2023, Congress promised free electricity up to 200 units per household in Karnataka. The party won a remarkable majority. Karnataka has now introduced the “Gruha Jyothi” scheme to implement the promise. Congress has promised free electricity in the run-up to the upcoming state elections in Rajasthan in 2023. AAP has also promised free electricity up to 300 units in Chhattisgarh in the lead-up to the 2023 state elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several past experiences such as in Andhra Pradesh and Delhi have shown that if governments increase the price of electricity, they face voter repercussions in the following election. Given that licensed distribution gives private companies more control than the government, distribution privatization becomes politically unfeasible. Even franchised private players attempt to increase collection and billing efficiency, thereby potentially creating a cost for voters when there might have previously existed none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, allowing private players to enter the market has consistently shown to improve the performance of distribution companies. A 2018 survey conducted by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) showed that electricity remains one of the top concerns for rural voters. Similarly, a 2017 survey in Uttar Pradesh indicated that electricity supply was one of the leading political issues during the elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is feasible that improved electric supply has appeal to voters — after all, not facing multiple outages is valuable to residential as well as industrial consumers. Therefore, it is important to explore whether voting behavior is affected by distribution privatization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess whether discom privatization leads to political parties being voted out, the authors looked at all instances where currently operational private companies (both license and franchise operators) were brought in. They then checked whether the incumbent candidate won in their constituencies in the election immediately after the private companies’ entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors calculated the percentage of candidates who did not retain their seats after the introduction of the private companies. Since private companies have a limited geography, the assessment is limited to the “Vidhan Sabha” (state assembly) seats of the concerned areas; the focus is on state rather than national seats since discoms — as well as most electricity sector governance — come under the ambit of state governments. Therefore, their electoral fortunes are assumed to be closely tied with the electricity sector in general and with electricity tariffs specifically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prove that distribution privatization leads to being elected out of office, the average percentage of candidates being voted out in areas with recent discom privatization should be higher than the state average. Therefore, the total average percentage of incumbents retaining their seats for all states for the specific election cycles was compared with the average percentage of specific areas with private distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors further compiled all their findings from various election cycles, calculated the percentage that an incumbent candidate lost elections, and compared this with the percentage for entire states (party in power is replaced by a contender). Additionally, they ascertained if the findings were different for private licensed distributors as opposed to franchised companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since all the data is qualitative, the assessment relies on indicator variables. A change in incumbents is denoted with “1,” while instances where the incumbents retain power are denoted by “0.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;data&quot;&gt;Data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, the report assesses 3,600 data points. This comprises data from 218 Vidhan Sabha elections from constituencies that were served by private distribution companies. Additionally, data from 3,364 state-level elections across six states is analyzed to provide a comparative analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Election results can be affected by multiple factors, and the authors do not claim causality. However, for the initial hypothesis — that privatization leads to incumbents being voted out of power — to be true, it must be proven that areas are more likely to replace the incumbent once a private distribution company enters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report has excluded six utilities that started operations in 2020 or later and therefore do not have instances of pre- and post-election scenarios to compare. The authors have also excluded one utility since it took over the license of a pre-independence utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observations&quot;&gt;Observations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private sector (licensed and franchised):&lt;/strong&gt; Out of all 109 Vidhan Sabha constituencies served by private sector distribution companies, across states and time, 41 saw the incumbent being removed from power after a private distribution company commenced operations — an average of 37.6 percent. For corresponding elections at the state level, the incumbent government was replaced three out of seven times — an average of 42.8 percent. There was a modest positive correlation between distribution reform and electoral success when comparing the constituency and state percentages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private sector (licensed only):&lt;/strong&gt; Out of 73 Vidhan Sabha elections in constituencies served by private sector licensed distribution companies, across states and time, 19 saw the incumbent being removed from power after the private distribution company commenced operations — an average of 26 percent. For corresponding elections at the state level, the incumbent government was replaced one out of four times — an average of 25 percent. There was no significant difference between the constituency and state percentages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private sector (franchised only):&lt;/strong&gt; Out of 36 Vidhan Sabha elections in constituencies served by private sector franchised distribution companies, across states and time, 22 saw the incumbent being removed from power after the private distribution company commenced operations — an average of 61.1 percent. For corresponding elections at the state level, the incumbent government was replaced two out of three times — an average of 66.7 percent. There was no significant difference between the constituency and state percentages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is therefore no notable difference in the percentage of incumbents being voted out of power between state averages and for areas with licensed distribution and franchised distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delhi:&lt;/strong&gt; Out of the 38 elections in constituencies served by private distribution companies, the incumbent was removed from power 9 times — an average of 23.6 percent. The statewide average among all constituencies was 24.2 percent in 2003. There was no considerable difference in the percentages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gujarat:&lt;/strong&gt; Out of the 14 elections in constituencies served by private distribution companies, the incumbent was removed from power 2 times — an average of 14.2 percent. The statewide average among all constituencies was 35 percent in 2012. Incumbent candidates contesting elections from constituencies served by private power distribution companies were re-elected more than the state average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maharashtra:&lt;/strong&gt; In the one election in a constituency served by private distribution companies, the incumbent was removed from power. The statewide average among all constituencies was 63.6 percent in 2009. The authors excluded Adani Power from the calculation since they took over an existing private license, rather than commencing private operations. Given the limited number of elections, the data is inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rajasthan:&lt;/strong&gt; Out of the 27 elections in constituencies served by private distribution companies, the incumbent was removed from power 16 times — an average of 59.2 percent. The statewide average among all constituencies was 60.3 percent in 2018. There was no significant difference in the averages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uttar Pradesh:&lt;/strong&gt; Out of the 9 elections in constituencies served by private distribution companies, the incumbent was removed from power 6 times — an average of 66.7 percent. The statewide average among all constituencies was 69 percent in 1993 and 62 percent in 2012. There was no significant difference in the averages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;West Bengal:&lt;/strong&gt; Out of the 20 elections in constituencies served by private distribution companies, the incumbent was removed from power 7 times — an average of 35 percent. The statewide average among all constituencies was 26 percent in 1982. There was a 9 percent difference in the averages indicating a higher probability of being voted out of power if the candidate was an incumbent when a private distribution utility commenced operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, all in all, in three states (Delhi, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh) it does not seem like switching to a private sector distribution company has any impact on the probability of an incumbent being reelected. In Gujarat, the probability of incumbents being voted out of power after distribution privatization is lower than the state average; in West Bengal, the probability of the incumbent being voted out of power after distribution privatization is higher than the state average. The data from Maharashtra is inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;road-map&quot;&gt;Road Map&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite promising performance in improving operational and financial efficiency, private sector companies face persisting challenges in terms of acquiring and operating utilities. While the report has already covered the major challenges vis-à-vis acquisition (i.e., political and electoral), this section looks at the experiences of various stakeholders involved in the privatization process. For a holistic review, the authors interviewed multiple stakeholders representing private sector utilities, government organizations, and independent regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After examining perspectives on the profitability of private companies, this section presents a road map for achieving operational and financial efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-profitability&quot;&gt;On Profitability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials interviewed from private sector companies agreed that it takes between two and six years to turn around a distribution utility company. However, there are some caveats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the time necessary for licensed distribution operators to financially turn around a utility company is less than what is needed for franchised operators. An official from BSES stated that it takes between three to five years to turn around a licensed distribution company, and Mr. Sanjay Banga, president for transmission and distribution of Tata Power, similarly put the number at two to five years. This is supported by Odisha’s example, as the ACS-ARR gap came down from ₹0.6/kWh ($0.0072/kWh) in 2018 (before Tata Power took over) to an average of ₹0.27/kWh ($0.0032/kWh) by 2022. On the other hand, Mr. Rajib Das, former senior official and currently consultant at CESC, stated that it takes between five and six years to turn a franchised utility around. A major reason causing this difference in duration is the licensed companies’ greater participation in tariff setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Mr. Banga stated that in PPP models, where the majority stake is held by the private partner, the partner is obligated to turn the utility around. And third, the share of rural consumers affects the time taken for a private firm to turn the firm around as well. This is because implementing technological changes such as metering can prove more challenging in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;road-map-for-introducing-private-sector-participation-in-the-distribution-sphere&quot;&gt;Road Map for Introducing Private Sector Participation in the Distribution Sphere&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road map is designed to assist government officials looking to introduce private sector players in the state electricity distribution ecosystem. Drawing from interviews with various private sector stakeholders and government officials with experience in discom privatization, the authors have compiled the key areas that should be considered to ensure that privatization is successful. The road map is meant to act as a step-by-step guide for officials. It is broken down into three subsections: planning phase, post-takeover changes, and challenges to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Planning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A. Choosing Areas of Operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important for state governments to decide which areas in the state to open to privatization. In Maharashtra and Gujarat, privatizing predominantly industrial areas has meant improved electrical access for firms. This has also protected farmers and rural consumers — both important voter blocs — from increased tariffs. From private companies’ perspective, serving industrial customers can be comparatively easier than serving rural consumers, since the operational costs vis-à-vis collection and billing are lower for industrial consumers. Similarly, as Delhi and Mumbai’s successful experiment with privatization has shown, private companies can perform well in urban areas. However, from the government’s perspective, if the objective is to improve electricity access in rural areas, then privatization should be considered a priority in those zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the licensing model that incentivizes companies to make long-term investments in the served areas can be beneficial for improving electricity access in rural areas. Mr. Gagan Swain, director of finance and corporate affairs at GRIDCO Ltd. Odisha, stated that power distribution in Odisha is operating under a licensee model where 51 percent share is with the private player and the remaining 49 percent is still with the state government. Odisha has been able to provide an average of 23.22 hours of electricity access in rural areas. He added that the Union Ministry of Power is impressed by this feat and that this model can be further explored for other state-owned discoms, which also have rural consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, Mr. V.P. Raja, former chairman of the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), stated that it will be difficult to find private companies willing to take over rural areas. Private companies would want to retain industrial and urban areas with high-paying consumers. It might thus be fruitful for the government to mandate private companies to take over certain rural areas along with potentially profitable areas. He gave the example of the privatization of the aviation sector in India, wherein the government mandated airlines to take over some loss-making air routes along with profitable routes. Additionally, he added that state governments must assess the consumer mix for an area before deciding whether it should be privatized. An assessment of whether the consumers in an area are industrial, commercial, residential, or agricultural can be made using available district census handbooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A senior official with Adani Power highlighted that for all special economic zones (SEZ), distribution companies can avail a “deemed distribution license” which allows them install alternate distribution infrastructure, thereby ensuring reliable electric supply to industrial consumers. Easing the license procurement process in SEZs allows for greater competition and improved supply. This foresight from the government has certainly helped industrial electricity access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A senior official from the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) added that it had historically been difficult to get existing utilities to take on the task of building infrastructure from the ground up in SEZs. Therefore, the decision to allow private players was driven by necessity. He added that there has been a renewed interest within the government to develop public-private models, which currently do not have access to electric networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GRIDCO’s Mr. Swain added that the size of the geography to be served with reference to the consumer mix under that geographical area should be considered while deciding between licenses or franchises. He gave the example of Rajasthan, where franchising is the prevalent model. He suggested that in places where the operational area is smaller, franchises can operate successfully. However, for larger areas, licensing allows for more holistic development and business ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;B. Choosing Models of Operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prevailing opinion among private sector stakeholders is that the licensed distribution model is superior to the franchised model. This is due to private companies’ increased operational, financial, and managerial control in the former. Mr. Banga of Tata Power underlined this by stating that the raison d’être of the franchised model was so that the government could maintain ownership of distribution while leaving the improvement of operations to the private sector. He added that this is reflected by the fact that since franchised operators are contractors, their incentive to invest in operational and capital expenditure is very low. This in turn means that the private players do not make long-term investments in creating assets or improving technology. To this end, Tata Power advocated to the Ministry of Power to modify minimum investment for franchisee models so that companies would not just come in, squeeze existing assets, and leave them in a worse-off state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Das from CESC added that franchises’ disinterest in making capital expenditure investments leads to a situation where franchise companies focus on following government incentives for reducing AT&amp;amp;C. Since reducing transmission and distribution losses requires capital investment, they tend to focus on billing and collection efficiency. He stated that the core of the problem behind franchised companies not making capital expenditure is the tariff model that the companies need to follow. Franchised operators are not included in the tariff setting and are instead “given” a tariff. Therefore, franchised companies cannot pass on expenditure as “passthrough costs,” and consequently minimize it. The official from Adani Power added that since franchise operators are interested in improving billing and collection, they do not focus on network capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another senior official from CESC adds that the sense of “ownership” differs between franchised and licensed operators. He adds that a franchised unit is just a contract, and therefore the private company doesn’t have an incentive to make long-term operational changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;C. Evaluating Existing Performanc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before a private company bids on and takes over a public distribution company, it evaluates the data provided by the company to measure the takeover’s financial feasibility. The companies’ financial projections are based on expected performance stemming from the initial data provided. However, often this data tends to be faulty, thereby putting the companies’ plans at risk. If a company doesn’t have a precise understanding of where it stands, then it becomes difficult for it to ascertain how it should proceed. Mr. Banga added that not having good baseline data also causes frictions with private investors, thereby adding problems for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the experience varies across different states. The official from Adani Power stated that MERC has a very sophisticated and robust system to ensure that companies are undertaking assessment and due diligence prior to acquisition. Mr. Raja stressed the importance of companies conducting independent data collection prior to takeover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A senior official from GERC stated that it has instituted specific regulations to ensure that the existing company is sharing larger regulatory information pertaining to its utility, once a new player is trying to take over. This allows the new company to have a clear picture of the operations and finances of the utility before they make their final decision vis-à-vis the takeover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;D. Assessing Sociopolitical Factors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to assess the sociopolitical factors involved in this debate in order to understand the public sentiment vis-à-vis privatization. Overwhelming negative sentiment can be detrimental to company operations, and private companies have had a mixed experience interacting with labor unions and customers. Torrent Power, for instance, has had various bad experiences dealing with both. In 2012, massive blackouts in Agra precipitated widespread protests and the kidnapping of company employees; in 2013, tariff increases in Bhiwandi caused massive protests. In 2015, Samajwadi Party (SP) leaders accused the company of harassing customers and forced it to shut down one of its offices in the city. The same year, after widespread protests by the Kanpur Electricity Supply Corporation (KESCO) staff, Torrent’s agreement to work in Kanpur was canceled by the Uttar Pradesh government. In 2021, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) workers vandalized company offices in Bhiwandi, and in 2022, company offices in Agra saw widespread agitation. Adani Power also faced agitation from power sector workers in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official from CESC stated that the company had a negative experience in its attempt to begin operations in Chandigarh due to resistance from existing employees. On the other hand, their transition in Rajasthan was very smooth — which he credited to customers’ previous experience interacting with private power distribution companies. Another source from CESC stated that the company has past experiences where customers have removed smart meters, thereby posting additional costs for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Banga from Tata Power mentioned that the response from customers and labor unions also depends on the reputation of the company. He stated that during Odisha’s first experience with privatization in 1999, the companies faced pushbacks from both labor unions and customers. However, when Tata Power started operations in 2020, there was virtually no pushback. He based this response on the company’s reputation. He added that customers often don’t care about where their electricity comes from if they have reliable supply and good customer service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;E. Contract Negotiation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting clear terms of operations between the government and private sector companies is crucial for the healthy operation of the firms. Certain pain points that exist include investment burdens of each party, tariff setting, performance assessment, and government incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Raghav Kanoria, managing director of IPCL, stated that the company’s experience taking over franchised operations in Bihar wasn’t fruitful since there was a misalignment of expectations vis-à-vis investments between the government and the company. Specifically, IPCL expected government support in terms of capital expenditure investments to supplement their own, per their agreement. However, the government did not provide the assured investments. Prior agreement on the repercussions of non-adherence of clauses could hence be beneficial. Mr. Swain stated that deciding which areas each party needs to invest in is also crucial for a good government-company relationship. He stated that there are multiple “social investments” that might not be feasible for the private sector to make unless they are mandatory. Here, the government may consider assisting PPP licensees in some non-remunerative areas. For instance, in Odisha, distribution infrastructure passing through forest areas was causing the electrocution of animals. The government spent roughly ₹600 crores ($70 million) to raise the height of electricity poles, insulate conductors, add spikes on poles, and take other measures to improve animal safety. The government also invested in shifting lines and transformers from the premises of schools and anganwadis for safety purposes. Since this was not a commercially oriented investment, the government did not expect the private sector to undertake it. Other areas that the government has made investments in include rural household electrification, cyclone-resilient infrastructure, and support in the energy transition process. Setting clear expectations on the areas of investments, thus, can inspire confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interactions with regulators are rife with friction caused during tariff setting. Prior discussions can help in managing expectations and ease some friction among stakeholders. The regulators are responsible for setting the energy tariffs that all other stakeholders — such as generators, distribution companies, and transmission companies — must abide by. The official from BSES stated that the Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (ERC) practice of setting tariffs for the entire segment — including generation, transmission, and distribution companies — and not providing a revenue-sharing breakdown for different stakeholders can be problematic. Distribution companies, as the last link in the chain of electricity provision, are at a disadvantage in securing part of the revenue for themselves. Power purchase comprises approximately 80 percent of the total costs. Cross-subsidy charges also tend to be unreasonable. For franchises, this problem gets further aggravated since they do not have any say in this process. In 2022, Torrent Power had pending undisputed claims worth ₹1,344 crores (about $160 million) and disputed claims worth ₹604 crores (about $72 million). On tariff setting, Mr. Banga added that in some cases, well-performing private sector companies are pushed to the verge of poor performance due to government interference. He gives the example of Tata’s Delhi distribution network. He stated that since the chief minister won the elections on the plank of free electricity, he is averse to raising power tariffs. Due to this, the company hasn’t been able to raise the tariffs, despite petitioning for the past eight to nine months. Governments should therefore attempt to address private sector fears over tariff setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there are tensions vis-à-vis proper auditing and performance assessment. Mr. Banga mentioned that the center and state regulators emphasize getting data auditing done properly. However, often data recording simply doesn’t exist at the level of various public sector as well as private utilities. Often, companies don’t report the data and regulators don’t ask for it. The lack of proper auditing and assessment is underlined by Mr. Kanoria of IPCL. He stated that despite a contractual obligation, regulators did not seek an independent performance assessment from them and the public sector distribution company, thereby making it impossible for his firm to be able to benchmark their performance and mark it against their initial agreement. The respondent from BSES stated that private discoms are exempted from receiving benefits from government programs and schemes for discom improvement. This means that private sector companies do not receive government-allocated funds for improving the distribution sector. While this is acceptable in principle, Electricity Regulatory Commissions need to consider that this impacts costs and tariffs. The problem is more acute for franchise operators. Mr. Banga stated that whenever new funds come for modernization, discoms do not pass on the funds for areas being served by franchises. The companies wish to spend the money on the areas they directly serve. This is incongruent since, as per the franchise model, the government ultimately owns the utilities being run by the private companies as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Post-takeover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Immediate Changes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A. Initial Assessment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated in the section above, having access to good baseline data is crucial to creating realistic projections about a company’s operational and financial performance. Mr. Rajib Das from CESC underlined the importance of having good baseline data and stated that companies should not only rely on government sources but also undertake a survey themselves soon after taking over the utility. This allows companies to have their own verified baseline data on which to formulate their projections. It could be beneficial for the government to mandate private companies to undertake a baseline data assessment soon after they take over; several regulators already do this. Government incentives such as financial support for the assessment can go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;B. Human Resources and Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to political and employment considerations, most private sector takeovers of distribution companies in India include an employee retention clause. This is done to provide safeguards or employment options for existing government employees, but it can be challenging for a private firm trying to bring in a new institutional culture in the organization. Therefore, it becomes important to set a vision for the company and ensure that all employees — new and old — are in sync with the company agenda. A senior official from CESC noted that even though there is an option for previous employees to stay on at the new company, several choose not to do so. Giving the example of an operation takeover in Maharashtra, he stated that the inability to seek rents once the private companies take over disincentivizes middle- and senior-level managers to remain. On the other hand, in Rajasthan several managers stayed but workers left. The official added that there is a dearth of talented power sector employees in the country, and therefore the company must aim to create a conducive environment to attract this talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official from Adani Power stated that the company took a different approach in Mumbai and retained as much talent as it could. He stated that rather than bringing new employees, the company focused on providing better key performance indicators (KPIs) for existing employees and helping them achieve their productivity. The company only hired new talent in areas where there was no existing capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the company also must ensure that there is no friction between the new management and employees, as well as between the company and government stakeholders. Mr. Banga from Tata Power stated that when the company took over utilities in Odisha, the Odisha Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC) set up a four-member board and made a government secretary its chairman. This allowed better coordination between the government and private stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official from GERC mentioned that the success of a utility ultimately depends on cost recovery. To ensure that companies are maintaining their financial hygiene, GERC has instituted a quarterly mechanism for reviewing retail tariffs. This eases the way for private sector companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;C. Managing Existing Customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there is a change in the management of a distribution company from public to private, there can be consumer anxiety over potential tariff increases, or fears about private sector apathy to operational issues. The private companies must address these as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Banga from Tata Power stated that in his experience consumers don’t care whether their electricity is being provided by government or private sector players. They do, however, care about tariffs. Assuring consumers that the private company will not raise tariffs for five years helps assuage these concerns. In the meantime, the private company gets an opportunity to improve the supply. Consumers also get accustomed to improved delivery, and hence they have a propensity to accept higher tariffs. He added that Tata’s brand image as a trusted 100-year-old firm does certainly help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to ensure that customer anxieties are being addressed is through opening call centers and advertising them heavily. An official from CESC stated that this is a low-cost, high-visibility measure. Torrent Power launched its fully digitalized trademark “Plugpoint” call centers since 2016. Adani Power has been able to improve customer service by leveraging two technologies. First, they have introduced an AI chatbot, which can help customers with basic services. Second, they also developed a video contact center, through which concerned customers can speak to an agent over video call. Speaking to a person helps assuage customer anxieties. On the other hand, the customer agent has access to a dashboard with information on the customers, which they can use to provide better customer service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;D. Quick Fixes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rationale behind implementing fast, highly visible operational improvements is twofold. First, it allows the private company to build a positive image that it can leverage to improve customer relationships. Second — and more importantly — making low-cost operational improvements allows the private company to improve its cashflows and develop a corpus of capital that it can then utilize for making large capital investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immediate operational improvements that were most frequently mentioned during interviews surround billing and metering. Often, when private companies take over, they realize that the previously operating public sector utility was underbilling consumers or not billing them at all. While sometimes this is due to faulty billing, often it is due to consumer firms securing unapproved preferential pricing due to a lack of proper oversight and transparency. Mr. Banga from Tata Power stated that the company must ensure that it is regularly billing consumers, sending them the bills, and providing them with electricity access 24/7. Only then, if a consumer refuses to pay, it is fair to cut their connections. Giving the example of areas where the company has been able to increase its collection efficiency from under 50 percent to 99 percent, he added that consumer education, and creating a mindset that electricity is a service that people need to pay for, goes a long way. The official from Adani Power concurred on the importance of consumer education. However, he argued that companies cannot take a “one size fits all” approach, and for certain areas better enforcement and coordination with local authorities can help. He added that building small customer care kiosks in multiple areas, where employees can assist customers with adopting digital tools, combined with rapid digitization, can help ease the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The respondent from CESC stated that they once found that large industrial consumers were being underbilled by a factor of 15 to 20. This was presumably due to collusion between the consumers and previous officials. While effective metering offers a solution for this, it can be very expensive to adopt cutting-edge smart meters. There has also been some level of consumer pushback against smart meters. He stated that the company has been able to move to a new, low-cost technology for meter reading which consists of a $0.80 port that can be installed on any smartphone. Using a mobile app, the port can provide meter readings within seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-Term Changes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A. Operational Improvement through Capital Expenditure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a private company has been able to make the discom profitable, it can start making long-term capital expenditures. Long-term capital expenditure is critical to the sustainability of long-term plans for the firm to remain profitable and ensure that the distribution technology is keeping pace with industry requirements. The optimization of capital expenditure takes time and firms cannot expect to seek quick returns from this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from moving away from regulatory assets, the emphasis of capital expenditure needs to be on technology adoption. Two areas were highlighted during conversations: improving cyber infrastructure, including data and security, and modernizing physical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Banga from Tata Power stated that there are two reliable data points that the private firms have access to: input cost of energy and money entering the companies’ bank accounts. Metrics such as billing and collection efficiency, as well as AT&amp;amp;C, can be manipulated using accounting techniques. However, better data can allow for improved collection, management, and analysis of the data. Mr. Raghav Kanoria from IPCL added that the company has benefited from making advances in smart metering and billing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Torrent Power has made strides in tech adoption for data management, and as of 2022, it has digitized all its documents and customer details and implemented Geographical Information System (GIS) technology for mapping consumers. Additionally, it has achieved 60 percent digital payments from its consumers. Torrent has also been able to develop advanced National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) for improving meter testing and billing. The company has also focused on strengthening cybersecurity measures, including developing multi-factor authentication at its facilities, privileged access mechanisms, endpoint detection and response, cyber crisis management plans, and a dedicated cybersecurity cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official from Adani Power stated that the company has benefited from adopting artificial intelligence and machine learning to better forecast energy demands. Additionally, creating digital payment mechanisms for payments has increased digital payment from 30 to 75 percent in the past five years. The company has also improved data collection and management infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Swain from GRIDCO added that technology adoption in the private sector is usually quicker. This is because the private sector tends to be more agile in comparison to public companies, and it often doesn’t need to operate through the same processes as the government does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modernizing physical infrastructure includes improving transmission and distribution networks. This includes investment in improving load centers as well as the cable networks. For instance, Torrent Power in Ahmedabad was able to bring down the transformer failure rate to 0.3 percent as of 2022 — compared to the national average of 15 percent — by installing 12,000 distribution transformers in the service region. Additionally, it has modernized the cable infrastructure by replacing the old and obsolete networks — including paper-insulated lead-covered (PILC) cable — with cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cable networks in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;B. Cost Optimization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While improving operational performance is beneficial for the financial health of a firm, interviewees from private discoms report that approximately 80 percent of their total operational cost is the price of procuring electric power. Given that private companies have little to no control on setting power prices, they must try to reduce all other redundant expenditure. One way of doing that and remaining lean is to outsource all “non-core” operations. The respondent from BSES mentioned that outsourcing tasks such as technology adoption and non-core manpower allows the company to leverage existing expertise without having to build its verticals. This ensures that management remains focused on the core tasks of the firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Opportunities and Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A. Renewable Energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the interviews, there is consensus among private sector stakeholders that renewable energy adoption is a significant opportunity. On the supply side, there is impetus from the government to incentivize renewable energy procurement through mechanisms such as renewable purchase obligations (RPOs). The respondent from BSES estimated that the organization should be able to move to 20 or 30 percent renewable energy generation over the next few years. One of the respondents from CESC stated that at the root of it, renewable energy procurement is a financial decision for firms. The good news is that after taking multiple factors into account, such as aging thermal plants and the penalties for not including renewable energy in the mix, procuring renewable energy is cost-effective for firms. This is also reflected in several firms’ expansion of renewable energy assets. For instance, as of 2022, Torrent Power’s renewable energy generation mix has reached 25.6 percent, and it is currently in the process of acquiring 1.1 GW capacity from ReNew Power. The official from Adani Power stated that the company has increased renewable energy penetration, from 3 percent at the time of takeover to 30 percent in 2023; they further intend to increase it to 60 percent by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the supply side, Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has provided its consumers with the ability to choose where their energy comes from. For instance, in Mumbai, companies have offered consumers the ability to pay a premium tariff to ensure that their electricity is being procured from green energy sources. Odisha Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC) has also offered a green tariff in Odisha. It must be noted that the first company to offer green tariffs in India was a public sector company — the Bengaluru Electric Supply Company (BESC), in Karnataka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distribution companies sit at a unique intersection where they both demand and supply renewable energy. Allowing them to gain freedom from legacy power purchase agreements (PPAs) could further incentivize them to procure renewable energy. In 2019, Tata Power advocated to MERC for consumers’ right to choose a green tariff, albeit at different prices. MERC agreed and allowed all electricity utilities in the state to raise the price by ₹0.66 (about $0.008) per unit for electricity sourced from renewable energy plants. MERC has reported an enthusiastic response from domestic and corporate consumers alike. Currently, Tata Power has 20,000 green customers consuming approximately 200 million units a month, with about 1,000 consumers being added each month. Adani Power in Mumbai has over 50,000 green tariff consumers. However, even as the central government has introduced the Electricity (Promoting Renewable Energy Through Green Energy Open Access) Rules, 2022, several states have not accommodated for these regulations. Mr. Raja stated that promoting open access is crucial for discom reforms. He added that promoting open access, while progressively reducing cross subsidies, can go a long way in the development of retail electricity markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The respondent from GERC stated that there is increasing interest in allowing franchisee companies to develop renewable energy microgrids in rural areas. Additionally, he added that private companies can be incentivized to install renewable energy by allowing for price differentiation between different consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Swain from GRIDCO provided the perspective of government-owned generation companies. He stated that there has been progress in expanding renewable energy generation capacity, due to support from both the central and state government. For instance, due to a low available solar/wind gradient, the cost of solar and wind production in Odisha is high. The government has been offering incentives in the form of waiving off wheeling charges, electricity duty, and transmission charge concessions to keep the price low. However, grid stability remains a challenge, and the state wishes to have investments in renewable energy storage technologies, especially pumped hydro storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;B. Institutional Challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several institutional challenges can be addressed through effective policy interventions. These include land acquisition, limited institutional capacity, and regulatory awareness. The official from BSES stated that the type of city and land availability for infrastructure improvements is a key consideration when companies are deciding to bid for areas, since the cost of building infrastructure is difficult in certain places due to differences in population density and land availability. The government can ease the process of land acquisition to incentivize companies to work in such areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporate disputes between regulatory bodies and companies often lead to a capital crunch for the firms. These are accentuated by limited institutional capacity and the existing regulatory model. For instance, in 2016, Torrent Power filed a case before the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) challenging GERC’s order for revising the regulatory charge down by roughly 60 percent. APTEL in turn referred the case back to GERC, which maintained its original position. While Torrent Power reserves the right to appeal to the Supreme Court, an expansion of institutional capacity would allow quicker reprieve to potential private sector partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example of limited institutional capacity is the delay by state regulators in implementing the “Automatic Pass-Through Model.” Torrent Power states in its 2022 annual report that even as the Ministry of Power came up with the Automatic Pass-Through Model to enable distribution companies to pass on the increase in fuel prices through tariffs, the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) had yet to come up with guidelines to implement it. Mr. Kanoria added that the central government was taking steps in the right direction. For instance, he mentioned that the 2022 Draft Electricity (Amendment) Rules require utilities to revise tariffs monthly to reflect a change in power purchase costs. However, it remains to be seen whether the bill will pass and, if so, how states will respond to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official from Adani Power stated that both the government and companies should focus on increasing competition in the sector. He argued that it is imperative for customer centricity that different companies be allowed to set up their own infrastructure and allow customers to choose — akin to airlines and telecom providers. He highlighted that there is increased interest from the central government in increasing competition in the sector. The respondent from GERC concurred, adding that the commission values competition over efficiency. He added that the government tries to bring in private players in areas where there might be a natural government monopoly, such as infrastructure development. Ultimately, the goal is to increase competition and create supply-based tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the respondent from BSES claimed that there is a lack of regulatory awareness. The government in Delhi makes promises such as 24/7 power and consumer protection; however, discoms are often left out of the loop, and this can be a problem. More interaction between the government and private providers can thus be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;4.28反送中遊行前夕報導林榮基彭定康 張劍虹：黎智英冀催谷上街人數&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;張劍虹：感覺黎智英會晤美國官員後「幾雀躍」 編採政策轉趨「偏激」&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（19日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第13日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。控方在庭上展示多則 WhatsApp 訊息，顯示黎智英在2019年4月28日反送中遊行前夕，先後指示張劍虹訪問前銅鑼灣書店店長林榮基和報導彭定康對《逃犯條例》修訂的評論，希望「催谷」遊行人數。同年7月，《蘋果》推行付費訂閱，首階段向每名讀者收取3元的訂閱手續費，張提議把其中1元撥出來作為抗爭者的訴訟費和醫療費，後來因為民陣成立一個支援反送中抗爭者基金，黎便指示把款項捐給民陣基金。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英指示訪問林榮基-以催谷428反送中遊行&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英指示訪問林榮基 以催谷4.28反送中遊行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。就黎智英向張劍虹下達的編採指示，控方指黎於2019年4月以 WhatsApp 指示一名叫「廖兄」的同事：「我們會用林榮基的新聞催谷廿八號大遊行，但要做頭條必須有林的電話訪問，請與林聯絡促成此事。謝謝。黎」，而相關訊息其後轉發給張。張解釋林榮基是前銅鑼灣書店店長，因在國內被人拘留一段時間，回港後連同律師何俊仁召開記者會講述事件，此後便沒有再返回國內，故在國內被通緝。林其後移居台灣，因此張請當地的《蘋果》同事嘗試聯絡林，並回覆黎稱「老闆，我已經請台灣同事處理」。黎回覆「很好，謝謝」，之後再傳送另一個訊息「衷心感謝」。以張的理解，黎是「希望利用《蘋果日報》的頭條來谷28號的大遊行人數」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹按黎指示訪問林榮基-遊行前一日頭版報導&quot;&gt;張劍虹按黎指示訪問林榮基 遊行前一日頭版報導&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱，由於當時他正在台灣公幹，而同事大概知道林身處某一間書店，所以便與台灣《蘋果》的攝影師一同前往尋找林。完成訪問後，張向黎報告「老闆，已經完成訪問了」，其後撰寫報導，然後把稿件分別傳送給香港和台灣的《蘋果》同事。其中香港的同事即時任總編輯羅偉光，讓他可先行以網上新聞形式發布。至於實體報紙，張跟時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏聯絡，轉達黎智英想以此新聞作為頭版，「就催谷跟住禮拜日嘅遊行，我就請佢（陳）去做A1。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年4月27日的《蘋果日報》頭版，標題為「林榮基流亡台灣 臨別呼籲 守護香港明日上街」。報導首段提到：「《逃犯條例》修訂殺到埋身，因偷運禁書被中國公安部追緝的前銅鑼灣書店店長林榮基為了不想成為逃犯，只好選擇逃命。他在佔中九子被判刑翌日隻身出走到台灣，投奔免於恐懼的自由。要永遠離開土生土長之地，他雖然難過，但痛心香港已淪陷，期望「香港人唔好詐瞓」，為了自己及下一代，每個人都要盡一己責任，上街反對《逃犯條例》惡法。」張解釋稱，林在訪問中以過來人身份，講述被壓迫要離開香港的經歷，並呼籲市民上街。而4月28日「反送中遊行」的確有舉行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指黎未覺滿意-繼而指示報導彭定康&quot;&gt;張指黎未覺滿意 繼而指示報導彭定康&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;遊行前一日，黎向張傳送訊息，稱林榮基的報導對催谷遊行有幫助，但認為氣氛仍然「未夠熾熱」，希望催谷更多人參與翌日的遊行，「俾我感覺係，佢未夠滿意。」黎又轉發數個訊息給張，顯示黎邀請「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）訪問前港督彭定康，以得到其對於《逃犯條例》的評語。之後羅傑斯回覆黎，他本人身在雅加達，而彭定康則在法國，會嘗試透過電話做訪問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭定康後來以訊息回覆，稱修例對於填補制度漏洞並不重要，反而它侵害香港的價值和繁榮穩定，對於香港的營商環境帶來恐懼和不確定性。政治活動亦陷入險境。彭定康又稱修例直接衝擊法治制度下的一國兩制和香港自治。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱黎希望《蘋果》能報導彭定康上述評語，並在網上新聞及翌日報紙盡快刊登。張遂向同事轉達黎的指示，最終報導在4月27日刊於《蘋果》網站，並於4月28日刊於實體報紙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指黎智英眼睛有問題-難以閱讀屏幕訊息內容&quot;&gt;辯方指黎智英眼睛有問題 難以閱讀屏幕訊息內容&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早休之前，辯方代表、大律師關文渭指黎智英因眼睛有問題，所以在被告欄內透過庭上電視屏幕閱讀涉案訊息時有困難，只能依靠聆聽證人讀出相關訊息內容。關又透露黎的眼睛曾做過手術，未知何時將會做下一次手術。控方遂表示會放大相關訊息方便黎閱讀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;再次開庭後，關指懲教人員已安排黎坐在被告欄第一排，但這仍未足夠，經辯方與懲教、法庭職員和控方商討後，各方同意安排把一個電子屏幕搬到被告欄內。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹指黎智英指示印製反送中長幡-隨報附送&quot;&gt;張劍虹指黎智英指示印製「反送中」長幡 隨報附送&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎於2019年6月13日指示張，指「星期日遊行泛民想我們印十萬張長幡35寸長15寸闊，派給遊行人士，給他們從家裹的窗口放出來」。張指因6月16日有反送中遊行，黎希望張以毛筆字寫「反送中」，然後印製十萬張長幡，隨報附送，讓市民遊行期間可以拿著該長幡。庭上展示長幡樣本，其中一張以黃色做底色，除了有黑色字「反送中」之外，還有「罷工、罷課、罷市」，張解釋當時職工盟正在策劃罷工，所以黎希望寫上「三罷」字眼以作宣傳。張指由於《逃犯條例》修訂暫緩，及後有人自殺，泛民人士如李卓人建議不要派發長幡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張提議三分一訂閱手續費支援抗者-獲黎同意&quot;&gt;張提議三分一訂閱手續費支援抗者 獲黎同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方之後展示2019年6月15日的 WhatsApp 訊息，張建議「就今次出來抗爭的人日後療傷和訴訟，我們可以在三元手續費撥一元出來成立基金協助」。黎則回覆：「非常好idea！」張解釋，由2019年4月1日起，黎決定推行「免費訂閱」，讀者只要登記做會員，便可免費閱讀《蘋果》網站新聞；同年7月1日起至9月1日期間，《蘋果日報》需向每人收取3元手續費，讀者才能看到網站新聞；直至9月1日起，《蘋果》開始正式收取訂閱費用，即每日1.68元。黎認為，將3元手續費之中的1元撥出來作為示威者的訴訟費和醫療費，可以鼓勵支持抗爭運動的人訂閱《蘋果》。後來黎指民陣已成立一個「支援反送中抗爭者基金」，指示「我們的錢可以給他們運用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年7月5日，張劍虹向黎報告指付費人數突破30萬人，並會按照黎的指示，請會計部同事以《蘋果日報》名義簽發支票，向民陣的基金捐款30萬元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（19日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第13日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。他稱黎於2019年7月赴美會見時任副總統彭斯和時任國務卿等官員，事後感覺到黎「幾雀躍」，並指示張報導訪美一事及「做大佢」。張憶述後來在言談之間，覺得黎「講制裁係多咗」，《蘋果日報》的編採政策亦轉趨「偏激」，例如「對成個運動比較暴力場合，同埋激進嘅場面，都會照報導、同情」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹感覺黎對會見官員感到幾雀躍&quot;&gt;張劍虹：感覺黎對會見官員感到「幾雀躍」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示一則由美國國務院前顧問 Christian Whiton 發送給前美國國防部副部長 Paul Wolfowitz 的訊息，載有《彭博新聞》的報導連結，標題為「Trump Team Sends Defiant Signal to Beijing by Meeting Activists」，內容講述黎智英赴美國會見官員。黎於2019年7月11日將該訊息轉發給張劍虹。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱以他所知，黎的確於2019年7月赴美國會見時任副總統彭斯、時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧和美國國家安全顧問 John Bolton，該次旅程結束後相隔一段時間，黎與張才有機會就旅程談話，張感覺到黎對會見官員感到「幾雀躍」，認為對反送中運動有幫助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英出席網上節目談制裁-事後指示張劍虹報導及做大佢&quot;&gt;黎智英出席網上節目談制裁 事後指示張劍虹報導及「做大佢」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示一則《蘋果》報導，內容提及黎智英出席何俊仁主持的網上節目「細說中南海」，當中黎談及與蓬佩奧會面，蓬佩奧問黎：「美國可以怎樣做？」黎則回答美國可以實施制裁，讓中國官員知道其所作所為會有後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張供稱，黎出席節目後，吩咐他報導節目內容及「做大佢」，包括較詳盡篇幅、擺在較顯眼位置和安排推播通知（push notifications）。張遂通知時任《蘋果》總編輯羅偉光，著他跟進。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在張的記憶中，黎在訪美之前，曾經在私下談話間提及制裁官員，「等佢哋唔敢亂嚟」，但是首次公開談論制裁則是在「細說中南海」節目裡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹指黎訪美後多談制裁-蘋果編採政策轉趨偏激&quot;&gt;張劍虹指黎訪美後多談制裁 蘋果編採政策轉趨偏激&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到，黎會見美國官員一事，有否影響到《蘋果日報》的編採政策。張則指，當時人們覺得「黎生原來可以去到白宮見到啲咁勁嘅官員」，並把香港的情況告知美國官員，張形容「好似有啲 high 咁囉，原來真係可以去到白宮㗎」，又指事件令人們認為「個運動好似⋯⋯啫係有希望咁囉」。張表示，後來與黎言談之間，「覺得佢（黎）講制裁係多咗囉。」他又指，《蘋果日報》的編採政策「後來愈來愈激烈，啫係偏激咁囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「偏激」的意思，張劍虹指黎在飯盒會及二人見面的場合裡，曾說過「示威抗爭、和勇唔好畀佢哋分化」的言論，「佢又會提到『抗爭會係長期性』咁囉」，「《蘋果日報》就會因為咁樣，而對成個運動比較暴力場合，同埋激進嘅場面，都會照報導、同情，啫（認為）係個政府同中共逼成咁嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張表示黎冀藉訪問抗爭者激起同情及抗爭情緒&quot;&gt;張表示黎冀藉訪問抗爭者激起「同情」及「抗爭情緒」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹稱，黎智英曾經在台灣舉行的「飯盒會」上，吩咐台灣及香港《蘋果》增加「訪談節目（video talk）」的數目，由每星期4次增至40次。訪談節目需要找「泛民反對派有代表性嘅人」或「抗爭者」作為拍攝對象。張在回港後有跟進上述事件，而黎亦有與張討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張解釋，他們會找「抗爭者」講述為何出來抗爭，以及他們的經歷和苦況，張相信黎希望藉此「激起啲人對抗爭者嘅同情，同埋抗爭情緒」。但由於很多「抗爭者」不願出鏡，因此張建議用訪問形式拍攝，然後將片段上載至動新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張表示節目以泛民反對派代表或抗爭者作主題&quot;&gt;張表示節目以「泛民反對派代表」或「抗爭者」作主題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰希望了解更多關於「訪談節目」的詳情，張解釋節目時長45分鐘，通常會用「Zoom」軟件對話，由港聞組節目部同事負責，並以「泛民反對派代表」或「抗爭者」作為節目主題，有時會找他們到《蘋果》的工作室對談。張表示，曾討論過訪談節目是否最適合的方法表達上述題材。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張稱港聞組全程投入處理反修例主題節目&quot;&gt;張稱港聞組「全程投入」處理反修例主題節目&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，訪談節目是否由2019年反修例運動衍生，張回答不是。李亦問，自2019年7月至年底，訪談節目的主題是否全都與反修例及示威相關，張表示大部分均是，且「成個港聞組差唔多全程投入晒去做呢個運動」。另外，張表示負責決定訪問對象的同事需向羅偉光負責，而羅會向張報告，張最後會按照黎智英指示執行。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》總編輯 羅偉光&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰表示自己沒有看過《蘋果》動新聞，因此問及誰人可以觀看訪談節目。張表示，付費訂閱的讀者可以觀看。他又確認，直至2019年7月初，共有30萬名訂閱者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件押後至下周二（23日）續審，下周一會給予時間張閱讀文件，但不會開放法庭予公眾。&lt;/p&gt;

The run-up to the election drew global attention because of the growing tensions in the Taiwan Strait. CSIS experts answer key questions about the election results and the implications for cross-strait relations and U.S.-Taiwan ties.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since current president Tsai Ing-wen was elected in 2016, official cross-strait dialogue has been suspended, and there is deep concern about China’s growing use of “gray zone” tactics and the rising possibility of actual hostilities. With the elections now concluded and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate William Lai the victor, all eyes are on the ongoing transition, which will culminate in Lai’s inauguration on May 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q1-were-the-election-results-surprising&quot;&gt;Q1: Were the election results surprising?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, the election results were largely in line with public opinion polls, which consistently showed Lai leading his opponents. Lai, who is currently vice president, ultimately won the election with just over 40 percent of the vote. The Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Hou Yu-ih placed second with 33.5 percent, and Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) candidate Ko Wen-je received 26.5 percent of the vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also as expected, Lai did not win an outright majority of votes. That puts him in a significantly different political situation compared to current president Tsai Ing-wen, who won both of her elections in 2016 and 2020 with over 56 percent of the vote. Lai’s weaker performance is not due to the success of the main opposition party candidate; the KMT’s Hou received a smaller share of votes than the previous KMT candidate did in 2020. Instead, both the DPP and KMT saw their vote shares hollowed out by Ko of the TPP. Ko won more third-party votes than any candidate since 2000, when the KMT’s James Soong ran as an independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Legislative Yuan elections were also not surprising. The DPP lost several seats and saw its majority disappear — a fact that will significantly complicate Lai’s ability to push forward a DPP agenda during his presidency. Meanwhile, the KMT gained 14 seats, for a total of 52, just ahead of the DPP’s 51. The TPP netted three seats for a total of eight. This marks the first time since 2004 that no party won an outright majority and means that the TPP will play a decisive role in forming a coalition to lead the legislature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q2-what-was-beijings-initial-reaction-is-this-a-huge-defeat-for-china&quot;&gt;Q2: What was Beijing’s initial reaction? Is this a huge defeat for China?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has taken several diplomatic measures in response to the election. Most significantly, just two days after the election, the small Pacific Island nation of Nauru announced that it is severing diplomatic ties with Taiwan and establishing relations with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement asserting that China has repeatedly engaged political figures there and offered economic assistance to persuade the island to switch ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timing of this move is obviously intentional, and it is a well-worn tactic Beijing has used to punish and isolate Taiwan under DPP presidents. In March 2023, China poached another Taiwan ally, Honduras, and timed the move to coincide with President Tsai Ing-wen’s transit through the United States. Altogether, China has now lured 10 countries to switch ties from Taiwan to the PRC during Tsai’s tenure as leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xzGSoS6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Countries Switching Diplomatic Recognition from Taiwan to China (2000–2024).&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://chinapower.csis.org/analyzing-chinas-response-to-taiwan-president-tsai-ing-wen-transit/&quot;&gt;CSIS China Power Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another display of Beijing’s influence, China reportedly pressured an international volleyball competition to relocate from Taiwan to Indonesia. China filed its protest over the competition in late December, but news of the move first broke on January 17, just days after Taiwan’s election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the diplomatic front, PRC authorities have issued statements criticizing the United States, Japan, and European countries for sending delegations to Taiwan in the wake of the election and criticized the U.S. State Department and the Philippines for issuing congratulatory statements to Lai. Importantly, however, the spokesperson of the PRC’s Taiwan Affairs Office put out a statement that seemed to somewhat downplay the outcome of the election: “Whatever changes take place in Taiwan, the basic fact that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China will not change; the Chinese government’s position of upholding the one-China principle and opposing ‘Taiwan independence’ separatism, ‘two Chinas’ and ‘one China, one Taiwan’ will not change.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has also threatened economic penalties. Although both China and Taiwan are members of the World Trade Organization, their economic ties are primarily governed by the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), which went into effect in 2010. In April 2023, Beijing launched a formal investigation into Taiwan’s compliance with the ECFA due to a long list of Chinese goods Taiwan bars from import to the island. China recently announced that Taiwan had violated its commitments and a few days before the election announced an initial list of minor penalties. It is possible Beijing will expand trade restrictions in the coming months and make it more difficult for Taiwan’s firms to produce in China, with a smaller possibility that it would outright suspend the ECFA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, Beijing has not taken any major military actions in response to the election. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has not announced any large-scale military exercises akin to those seen in August 2022 in response to Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan and April 2023 in response to Tsai Ing-wen’s transit through the United States. According to regular releases by Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense, no PLA aircraft were reported around Taiwan or in Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) on the day of the election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the PRC did fly a high-altitude balloon near Taiwan’s northern coast on election day. Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense began reporting the presence of PRC balloons flying around and over Taiwan in early December 2023, and the PRC has continued to fly these balloons frequently, including after the election. Additionally, after the election, from January 17–18, Taiwan reported 24 PLA aircraft flying around the island, with some of these conducting rare nighttime patrols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again Beijing’s desire to see a more conciliatory party win the presidential election did not materialize. Chinese leaders can take some solace in the fact that Lai did not win an outright majority and that his presidency will be constrained by the DPP’s loss of the legislature. They can also see some rays of hope given that the DPP moderated its policies over the last eight years under Tsai and did not more aggressively push for outright de jure independence. But international sympathy for Taiwan continues to grow, and the prospect of unification seems more distant than ever. As a result, Beijing will need to reconsider its approach if it wants a different outcome in cross-strait ties and to remove this issue as a potential flashpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q3-what-role-did-taiwans-economy-play-in-the-election&quot;&gt;Q3: What role did Taiwan’s economy play in the election?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relative to other economies in the region and elsewhere, Taiwan’s economy has good fundamentals and fared relatively well through the pandemic. Yet recent volatility and some chronic problems — housing costs chief among them — made the economy’s performance a central issue in the elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s economy maintained steady growth through most of the pandemic, but fell significantly in late 2022 and early 2023, with 2023 Q1 growth declining by 3.4 percent, coinciding with the end of China’s zero-Covid policy and the subsequent outbreak of cases and sudden drop in its economic activity. Taiwan’s economy picked up over the 2023, with growth of 3.4 percent in Q2 and 2.3 percent in Q3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key concern for voters is the cost of living. Though some blame high interest rates, the cost of housing in Taiwan’s main cities is high by international comparison. Inequality in Taiwan is still low compared to elsewhere, but it has crept up the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also concern about overdependence on economic ties with China. That said, there has been a relative decrease in dependence, partly as a result of Taiwan’s New Southbound Policy and partly as a result of adaptations to growing U.S.-China tensions. From 2010 to 2022, China’s share of Taiwan’s exports only dropped from 28 percent to 25 percent of the total, but China’s share of outbound foreign direct investment from Taiwan has fallen much further, slipping from 84 percent to 34 percent of the total during this period, according to PRC statistics. (Taiwan’s data, which may be less complete because it only counts projects approved by Taiwan authorities, shows a much steeper fall, with China only accounting for 11.5 percent of Taiwan’s $26.65 billion in outward foreign direct investment in 2023.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another broad concern is the composition of Taiwan’s economy. Taiwan’s public is proud of the island’s global leadership in semiconductor manufacturing, and Taiwan is adding to its capacity at a faster rate than anyone else. Yet there are worries that the dominance of semiconductors leaves Taiwan putting its economic eggs in one basket while crowding out opportunities for other industries, which could hurt Taiwan’s industry and workers. However, the overall situation has remained steady. Services are a growing share of the economy and was the sole source of growth in 2023. At the same time, even with China’s massive manufacturing capabilities, Taiwan has managed to maintain a large manufacturing sector itself, with manufacturing contributing over 30 percent of GDP and 24 percent of employment in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q4-what-does-the-outcome-mean-for-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Q4: What does the outcome mean for the United States?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the absence of formal diplomatic relations, Taiwan is a critical partner for the United States on a range of issues, from technology to public health to security. That Taiwan held its eighth peaceful presidential election, even amid significant pressure by Beijing, is itself an important development for the United States. Taiwan continues to stand out in Asia as a vibrant, prosperous, and stable democracy, which would not have changed regardless of which candidate received the most votes on January 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lead-up to the election, the Biden administration, through words and deeds, made it clear that the White House had no preference in terms of election outcomes. This is long-standing U.S. policy and is important for providing space for the people on Taiwan to make their own determinations about how they want to be governed. Of course, different candidates offered varying visions for how they wanted to govern Taiwan, but all three candidates sought to preserve the cross-strait status quo in their own way, which remains the overriding U.S. interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As President Tsai’s current vice president, Lai has signaled clearly and strongly that he seeks peace and predictability in his relationship with the United States, with China, and with the global community. While Beijing may warn of Lai’s latent secessionism, there is no evidence that a Lai administration will seek radical change. He is not version 2.0 of Chen Shui-bian, Taiwan’s first DPP president. As such, the United States will likely have an active partner in Lai on a number of fronts, with much of the important work of upgrading Taiwan’s defense capabilities that began under President Tsai continuing once Lai assumes office in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Lai will face a challenging new geopolitical environment, and as a relatively untested foreign policy leader, problems will inevitably occur. First and foremost will be Beijing’s coercion campaign, which will only increase in intensity in the coming years. Building effective communication between Taipei and Washington to manage China’s likely stepped-up boundary probing, disinformation, and outright aggression will be imperative. Lai’s vice president-elect Bi-khim Hsiao has significant foreign policy experience given her recent role as Taipei’s representative in D.C. and will likely help Lai and his team navigate the challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q5-what-are-the-chief-security-risks-going-forward&quot;&gt;Q5: What are the chief security risks going forward?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has long expected and prepared for a potential Lai victory, readying a range of political, economic, and military options to showcase PRC displeasure and punish Lai if Beijing deems his words or actions as provocative. Although the PLA will continue to play a key role in China’s overall response to Lai, it will not be the only instrument that China uses, and — depending on what prompts China to take action — it may not be the most significant tool that Beijing leverages. At a minimum, Beijing is likely to continue to ramp up daily military and quasi-military pressure on Taiwan. This includes increased PRC air and maritime activity near and within Taiwan’s ADIZ. It also includes the use of satellite launches over Taiwan as well as balloons to further diminish Taipei’s control over the island’s airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibility that Beijing could use significant military force against Taiwan in 2024 if the PRC views Lai as crossing a critical redline cannot be ruled out. However, if Beijing does not view Lai as deviating from Tsai, several factors are likely to dampen Beijing’s calculus to proactively use significant military force against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Beijing recognizes that Lai did not win over 50 percent of the presidential vote and the DPP did not maintain a majority in the Legislative Yuan. This provides Beijing breathing space and allows China to continue to make the argument that peaceful unification is still possible and Lai does not represent the will of the Taiwan people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China faces significant economic headwinds domestically and likely understands that any use of major military force against Taiwan could exacerbate China’s domestic situation. PRC military action against Taiwan could further weigh on foreign investment in China and cause multinational companies operating in China to reduce their activities and footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Beijing has actively sought to stabilize U.S.-China relations and has increased official and people-to-people dialogues and engagements with the United States. Beijing hopes the Biden Administration will help rein in Lai to some extent. A significant PRC military operation against Taiwan could undermine the recent “progress” Xi Jinping has made in U.S.-China bilateral ties and further strengthen the positions of those against China within the United States. This is particularly risky when there is a U.S. presidential election later this year and most U.S. presidential candidates have already adopted tough positions on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Xi is likely aware that the PLA still suffers from significant problems. The recent purging of senior PLA leaders, particularly from the PLA Rocket Force, showcases the extent to which he is focused on rooting out problems within China’s military. Questionable PLA capability will not stop Xi from using military force against Taiwan if he assesses the political situation requires it, but problems within the PLA are likely to cause Xi to think twice about using significant military force if China does not have to do so now.&lt;/p&gt;

Analysts expect the satellite to settle into a position that would allow continuous surveillance of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, as well as Taiwan and Mainland China.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Paired with data from other Chinese surveillance satellites, Yaogan-41 could provide China an unprecedented ability to identify and track car-sized objects throughout the entire Indo-Pacific region and put at risk numerous U.S. and allied naval and air assets operating in the region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-yaogan-41&quot;&gt;What is Yaogan-41?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officially, the Chinese government says that Yaogan-41 is a civilian high-altitude optical remote-sensing satellite intended for crop yield estimation, environmental management, weather forecasting, and disaster prevention. However, Western observers assess that Yaogan-41 is primarily a military reconnaissance satellite, as the Yaogan program supports the space component of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). China has successfully placed 144 Yaogan surveillance satellites into orbit since the start of the program in 2006. Translated into English from Chinese, Yaogan literally means remote sensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Yaogan-41 reaches its intended position it will become the fourth Chinese optical surveillance satellite in GEO. Notably, Yaogan-41 is much larger and heavier than its three optical predecessors. Whereas these other satellites were launched by the Long March 3B rocket, capable of lifting 2,000 kilograms (kg) into GEO, Yaogan-41 used China’s largest rocket, the Long March 5, capable of launching a 4,500 kg payload. Additionally, Yaogan-41’s payload fairing was 50 percent longer than the usual Long March 5 fairing, making the particular Long March 5 that launched Yaogan-41 China’s tallest rocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts assume that Yaogan-41 is also more capable than its three GEO peers, whose highest optical resolution is believed to be around 15 meters. This resolution is enough to detect and likely classify large ships. If Yaogan-41’s builders were able to incorporate technology Chinese researchers expected to perfect by 2020, the optical resolution of Yaogan-41 might approach 2.5 meters. This resolution would be enough to identify and track car-sized objects, the equivalent to seeing a strand of hair from 800 meters away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-is-yaogan-41-different-from-most-surveillance-satellites&quot;&gt;How is Yaogan-41 different from most surveillance satellites?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most remote-sensing satellites, including those from the United States, Europe, Russia, and China, operate in low Earth orbit (LEO), which is up to 3,000 kilometers (km) in altitude. The majority of satellites currently in orbit and the bulk of surveillance satellites operate in LEO because it is much easier and cheaper to launch satellites into LEO than into higher orbits. Additionally, for an equivalently sized sensor, placing that sensor in LEO produces sharper resolution because it is closer to the objects on Earth. LEO satellites, however, lack one characteristic that can be crucial to surveillance: persistence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical satellite in LEO orbits the Earth in less than two hours, thus only seeing a given spot on Earth for a few minutes. Additionally, due to orbital mechanics, it may take hours or days for that satellite to revisit the same spot again. Though a constellation of satellites at lower orbits can provide persistency by reducing the revisit time, satellites in GEO orbit at the same rate as the Earth, which means they view the Earth as if it is not moving. Only GEO provides a satellite, like Yaogan-41, with a persistent view of the same place. An additional advantage is that a GEO satellite can see almost half of Earth’s surface from its 36,000 km altitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of geosynchronous weather satellites, which are effectively very low-resolution remote sensing systems optimized to track large cloud formations and storms. However, only China and India operate high-resolution optical GEO satellites, but India’s system carries a multi-spectral payload and not a visible light optical imager like its Chinese peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-chinas-other-geo-remote-sensing-satellites&quot;&gt;What are China’s other GEO remote sensing satellites?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China operates three other optical surveillance satellites in GEO. These three satellites are part of the Gaofen program, which has 29 satellites operating in LEO for a total of 32. Gaofen, which means high resolution, is part of the China High-resolution Earth Observation System (CHEOS), an ostensibly civilian initiative to assist in agriculture, disaster response, and environment monitoring activities. In addition to satellites, CHEOS operates near-space, airborne, and ground-based data collection and processing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though China provided significant details about the payloads for the first seven Gaofen satellites, which often included multiple sensors, including optical, hyperspectral, multispectral, and SAR capabilities, it has provided little information about subsequent satellites. The three Gaofen satellites operating in GEO are Gaofen-4, Gaofen-13, and Gaofen-13-02. Launched in 2015, Gaofen-4 was equipped with a 50-meter resolution electro-optical sensor and could capture three images per minute. While unconfirmed by China, experts believe that Gaofen-13, launched in 2020, and Gaofen-13-02, launched in 2023, can capture images with a resolution of 15 meters. Yaogan-41 is believed to be the successor to Gaofen-13 satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these optical surveillance satellites, China operates one synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) satellite in GEO, called Ludi Tance-4 (Land Exploration-4 in English). Launched in August 2023, it is the world’s first and, currently, only GEO satellite with a SAR payload. The resolution of Ludi Tance-4 is 20 meters. The advantage of SAR is that it can see through clouds and at night. Like the three Gaofen satellites and Yaogan-41, China claims that the Ludi Tance-4’s mission is purely civilian and aimed at providing information about land resources, disaster prevention and response, and forestry applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-will-china-use-the-yaogan-41-capability&quot;&gt;How will China use the Yaogan-41 capability?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the United States, Europe, and Russia, China has emphasized the development and expansion of a high-resolution GEO optical and SAR surveillance capability. While there are civilian applications for such capabilities, those applications can generally be served by satellites operating at lower altitudes, which are easier and cheaper to reach and provide higher resolution images than GEO alternatives. Additionally, civilian applications such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and disaster preparedness do not typically necessitate the extra costs associated with persistent coverage, as these applications have no movement detection and tracking requirements. Take for instance, the equivalent civilian U.S. and European satellite programs, Landsat and Copernicus, respectively, which both operate satellites in LEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing, which probably assesses the greatest threats to its security and freedom of movement will come from the Indo-Pacific, has determined that it will pay a premium to obtain persistence and the ability to detect change in near-real time across the region. Using 50-meter resolution data from the Gaofen-4 satellite during a presentation at the International Astronautical Congress in 2016, China demonstrated it could identify ship trails, which form when ship exhaust interacts with clouds in the lower troposphere. Persistency also allows for real-time tracking, meaning that whatever China identifies it could track using the same capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paired with its existing GEO optical surveillance capabilities, Yaogan-41’s increased resolution means that China will be able to more easily identify and track U.S. and allied naval forces in the Indian and Pacific Oceans than it ever could before. This increased resolution may give China the ability to identify and track even smaller objects, not just ships, but airborne assets like fighter aircraft and bombers as well. While stealth technology can help aircraft evade detection by radar, it is less effective against optical sensors, as demonstrated when a Google Maps user spotted a B-2 stealth bomber flying over Missouri. Pairing data from Yaogan-41 and China’s legacy GEO surveillance satellites with trained artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms would likely automate and speed up identifying objects of interest. For example, the New York Times has already used a similar approach, pairing satellite imagery and AI technology to identify bomb craters in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its optical and SAR GEO remote sensing satellites, China operates around 300 other surveillance satellites in lower orbits. China could use its persistent, GEO surveillance capabilities to locate, identify, and track U.S. and allied naval forces operating in the Indo-Pacific region. In real time, such tracking information could be used for tasking China’s LEO surveillance satellites, which possess better resolution than GEO system, other intelligence collection platforms to gain more insights, or for targeting of long-range missiles, such as China’s DF-21 and DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-this-mean-for-us-national-security&quot;&gt;What does this mean for U.S. national security?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLA leaders, whether for defensive or offensive planning purposes, seek to know the real-time locations of allied naval and air forces operating in the Indo-Pacific theater. Recognizing the limitations of ground-based radar, China has built up a capability over the last decade using GEO optical and SAR satellites — a combination unique to China and tailored to China’s security concerns — for identifying and tracking threats. Yaogan-41 may significantly improve China’s ability to detect and track not just naval vessels, but also aircraft. Paired with AI algorithms and sufficient computational resources, capabilities afforded by Yaogan-41 will make it more difficult for the United States and its allies to hide vessels larger than an automobile in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, other than submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies have assumed China already maintained space-based surveillance capabilities that could keep fairly accurate tabs on large surface ships in the region. Going forward, they should consider that China might also be able to detect and track aircraft, even those far out into the Pacific Ocean and those designed to evade radar. Though GEO systems would be sitting ducks in any conflict, they could serve a vital role in a first-strike scenario by locating and aiding in targeting of key U.S. and allied platforms. While clouds will still obscure optical space-based systems and AI algorithms make mistakes, relentless advances in Chinese surveillance capabilities could soon produce an Indo-Pacific region where there is no place to hide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（18日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第12日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。談到黎曾下達的指示，控方展示 WhatsApp 訊息，顯示2019年3月前政務司司長陳方安生會見時任美國副總統彭斯之後，黎指示張報導及「做到最大嘅效果」。張遂把黎的指示轉達給其他同事，包括時任總編輯羅偉光和副社長陳沛敏。翌日《蘋果日報》實體報紙頭版便以〈彭斯晤陳太 關注港人權〉為標題。此外，黎於2020年5月指示管理層籌備英文版，形容黎「好心急英文版快啲面世」，又催促資訊科技部同事盡快設立英文版網站，因黎希望讓美國讀者「成為《蘋果日報》同美國政治嘅槓桿」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹續作供黎智英好心急冀英文版盡快面世&quot;&gt;張劍虹續作供：黎智英「好心急」冀英文版盡快面世&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。就《蘋果日報》英文版的成立過程，張憶述約於2020年5月中，黎智英成立了一個名為「English news」的 WhatsApp 群組，黎是群組管理員，其他群組成員包括張自己、副社長陳沛敏、總編輯羅偉光、動新聞平台總監張志偉、兩岸版的副總編輯蔣美紅、資訊科技部同事Connie Chan。而英文版主筆馮偉光亦在後來加入英文版工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指，黎在 WhatsApp 群組裡開宗明義，當時「覺得係好需要成立英文版嘅時候」，遂吩咐管理層盡快成立英文版，並在群組內詳細解釋他對英文版的目標、期望和做法。黎亦指示張負責聯絡馮偉光重新入職《蘋果》，主理英文版。張遂於同年5月下旬相約馮午餐，其後馮答應6月初回來上班。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張形容，「黎生亦都好心急英文版快啲面世」，又催促資訊科技部同事盡快設立英文版網站，以及在《蘋果》的手機應用程式引入英文版頁面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹：黎智英冀英文版「走向美國」 使美讀者成為蘋果與美國政治「槓桿」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到，為何黎智英認為當時是合適的時候設立英文版。張指黎曾在群組中表示，「如果外國讀者、支持香港的讀者，透過訂閱《蘋果日報》英文版，咁樣對《蘋果日報》本身嚟講都係好大幫助。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又指：「黎生特別提到做呢個英文版係走向美國啦」，因他希望「讓呢啲美國讀者成為《蘋果日報》同美國政治嘅槓桿」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱黎表明英文版寫手要「偏黃」、意指「支持抗爭及逆權」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到，馮偉光憑甚麼準則，揀選中文版部分文章翻譯成英文。張劍虹解釋，馮主要根據黎智英的指引，黎在英文版 WhatsApp 群組，「開宗明義」表示選擇英文版寫手的標準，就是要偏向《蘋果日報》的立場，即「偏黃」，以張的理解即是「支持抗爭、支持逆權」。張又指黎曾經吩咐不要揀選「Pro China（親中）」的文章。於是同事討論後，確認揀選出來的文章「要係啲抗爭呀、逆權呀、制裁呀」，並與「反香港政府」及「反中共」相關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎智英專欄「成敗樂一笑」其中一篇文章，標題為〈大時代快將來臨〉，又展示該文章同時被翻譯成英文並上載至網站。張表示，文章是由馮偉光根據黎智英定下的框架自行揀選。法官李運騰問，黎智英是否不會指明揀選哪一文章，張同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張表示黎冀透過與外國前官員等有影響力人士訪談-以造成輿論&quot;&gt;張表示黎冀透過與外國前官員等有影響力人士訪談 以造成輿論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後問及英文網站上的節目《Live Chat with Jimmy Lai》，張確認節目成立於2020年7月9日，並為公開節目，公眾可於《蘋果》網站及其手機應用程式觀看。控方問及黎設立節目之目的，張表示黎智英希望在《國安法》生效之後，與「外國知名學者、政客和前官員」進行訪談，因「佢哋都係有影響力嘅人」，黎希望藉此「造成輿論」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指黎會在訪談中提及香港被打壓情況-希望外國援助&quot;&gt;張指黎會在訪談中提及香港被打壓情況 希望外國援助&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，黎會在訪談中提及香港的局勢情況，特別是《國安法》成立之後，「香港被打壓嘅情況、對於法治嘅影響、對金融中心地位嘅影響」，黎希望外國可以援助香港。張表示自己沒有親自參與製作上述節目，而時任《蘋果》動新聞平台總監張志偉則要協助將訪談片段上載至各網上平台。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張表示黎及助手mark-simon負責邀約嘉賓&quot;&gt;張表示黎及助手Mark Simon負責邀約嘉賓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，誰人負責訪談前的安排和準備工作，例如邀約嘉賓。張表示據其所知，是由黎智英及其助理 Mark Simon 自行處理，並沒有經張及《蘋果日報》其他同事處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英指示報導陳方安生會見彭斯-做到最大嘅效果&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英指示報導陳方安生會見彭斯 「做到最大嘅效果」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後在庭上展示 WhatsApp 訊息，黎智英於2019年3月23日以 WhatsApp 轉發一張照片給張劍虹，顯示前政務司司長陳方安生赴美國會見時任副總統彭斯。張稱黎告知他這是很重大的新聞，並吩咐他將此新聞「做到最大嘅效果」，張之後回覆「收到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The context in which decisions about human–machine teams and related technology are made is one in which the UK and the US face competitors that could reach parity in qualitative terms, and which possess selective advantages in mass stemming from both their industrial capacity and proximity to likely theatres of conflict, and from operational concepts specifically designed to target and defeat Western capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these unprecedented challenges, the UK and the US possess considerable operational and military–technological asymmetries as a consequence of their democratic institutions, longstanding organisational biases, and experiences that are difficult for their competitors to deliberately replicate. Both countries trust their militaries to adapt and innovate at the lowest level. They have experience in combined arms operations, including in expeditionary environments. And neither country suffers from authoritarian pathologies such as endemic corruption, loyalty-based promotions or heavy censorship. Using these traits to shape the way the UK and US militaries develop, deploy and use capabilities will make it difficult for competitors to replicate Western countries’ performance, even with the same underlying technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of a broader offset strategy informed by these asymmetries, the UK and US militaries should use human–machine collaboration (HMC) and human–machine teaming (HMT) to: demonstrate the potential to decrease the military, economic and political cost of war for the US and the UK and increase such costs for their adversaries; achieve decision advantage and impose dilemmas on adversaries; and generate awareness in denied environments. Given competing demands for finite resources, the US and UK militaries should focus, in the near term, on developing, acquiring and fielding a specific group of HMC and HMT capabilities and enablers necessary for accomplishing these goals. Such capabilities would be selected in terms of enabling activity within anti-access area denial bubbles. This specific task can be broken down into a number of sub-activities, including improving sensing, analysis, planning and decision-making, developing lower-cost and more attritable forces, uncrewed sustainment for expeditionary forces, enhancing deception, and leveraging HMC for predictive maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, caveats. First, unlike in the precision revolution, the West will not enjoy an obvious, persistent technological advantage in AI, autonomy, computing, and other militarily relevant science and technology fields. Second, a number of barriers that prevent the adoption and scaling of innovations will need to be overcome if the military potential of emerging technology is to be realised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this policy guide, the authors argue that advances in human–machine teaming will be crucial to delivering effective offsets to adversary advantages. To execute an offset strategy, militaries will need to develop technology and dedicate significant resources towards the development of new concepts of operations and approaches that treat the combination of human judgement and technological capabilities as central to success. This will be key to leveraging enduring organisational advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper aims to serve as a primer and policy guide for policymakers, outlining the ways in which HMC and HMT make use of the specific approaches harnessed by Western states for technological change in service of these countries’ asymmetrical advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging AI will be critical to delivering Western forces capable of competing and warfighting in the future operating environment, particularly against peer and near-peer competitors. Notable figures ranging from the current First Sea Lord, Admiral Ben Key, to former US Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work have stressed that Western militaries must leverage innovation to overcome adversary capabilities. However, Western militaries cannot assume technological overmatch against some plausible competitors, particularly China. Unlike in the Cold War era, when the West enjoyed clear qualitative advantages in several key areas such as command, control, communications, computers (C4) intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) and precision strike, in the future operating environment it could well find itself operating against China or a China-backed Russia – countries that can leverage a research and development base qualitatively comparable to those found in the West, particularly in areas such as AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering an offset strategy against such an opponent therefore involves more than merely developing or acquiring emerging technology. Instead, that technology’s impact will depend on how effectively it can be incorporated into concepts of operations that both accentuate the human and machine strengths of a friendly force and exacerbate the weaknesses of an opponent’s force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The militaries that best leverage autonomy and AI, then, will be those that best situate them within a warfighting system that includes concepts that guide their employment and organisational practices to generate forces that can properly use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This policy guide aims to prime policymakers on the factors that need to be considered to leverage human–machine collaboration (HMC) and human–machine teaming (HMT) for an offset strategy. Chapter I examines how the advent of AI and autonomy on the modern battlefield can change the conduct of warfare, and scopes both the opportunities that militaries can leverage and some of the challenges that they might face. Chapter II focuses on the specific operational objectives that militaries should pursue using HMC and HMT. Chapter III concentrates on priority capabilities where HMC and HMT can deliver capabilities before 2030 and give Western militaries a competitive edge – and the enablers needed to create and field them effectively. Chapter IV outlines general principles that should guide the development of the capabilities described in Chapter III within Western militaries and defence establishments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;purpose-and-methodology&quot;&gt;Purpose and Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the research project underlying this policy guide is to inform future defence approaches in the US and the UK and, between them, on HMC and HMT. It was carried out through a partnership between the Special Competitive Studies Project and RUSI, and through separate collaborations with the US Marine Warfighting Lab and the UK Ministry of Defence. The project brought together experts and practitioners from across the national security and emerging technology communities via a series of workshops held simultaneously in London and Washington, DC. The first of the three workshops, held on 10 November 2022, focused on identifying existing HMC and HMT capabilities and forecasting the development of capabilities that could realistically be fielded by 2030. The second workshop, held on 8 December 2022, focused on further refining the list of capabilities, and on identifying key enablers needed for the rapid incorporation of HMC and HMT into military activities and operations. The third workshop, held on 2 February 2023, focused on identifying implementation principles for HMC and HMT for the US Department of Defence and the UK Ministry of Defence. The results of these engagements are the basis of this policy guide, supplemented by a review of existing literature and consultations with experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-what-are-humanmachine-collaboration-and-humanmachine-teaming&quot;&gt;I. What are Human–Machine Collaboration and Human–Machine Teaming?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMC and HMT combine the human, the machine, and the interactions and interdependencies between them. HMC focuses on optimising cognitive tasks, particularly decision-making, while HMT focuses on more effectively executing a wider range of complex tasks in physical spaces. Applications vary, and the most advanced applications will include elements of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we define HMT as a complex military process with a feedback loop between the human and the machine which changes the behaviour of both. For example, if human operators deploy an uncrewed asset such as a UAV into a contested airspace with specific rules of engagement, the human’s control over the UAV circumscribes its behaviour on the battlefield. Equally, the output the machine delivers independently into the feedback loop – for example, the ability to classify targets without direct intervention – can change the operator’s decisions and subsequent actions. This is unlike a tool like artillery, which is basically linear: an operator knows what that tool can do and can predict outcomes (bar anomalies and miscalculations) accordingly – and the tool does not independently generate behaviour or information for which the operator must account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core concept of HMC and HMT is that humans and machines have comparative advantages and excel in different areas. Humans generally outperform machines on high-context tasks (those that focus on relationships between objects, rather than on a particular focal consideration) and on various types of creative exploration. Machines, on the other hand, often outperform humans on tasks that require processing extremely large volumes of data, or which need a high degree of precision, speed or consistent repetition. Augmenting human weaknesses with machine strengths (and vice versa) can create interdependent HMTs that outperform both humans and machines individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advances in AI-enabled HMC, in particular, could expand a military’s ability to assess situations quickly, plan effectively and make decisions. A warfighter’s mental bandwidth, like every human’s, is limited. Military personnel collaborating with machines can break problems down into their component parts and allocate some tasks to be optimised, automated or performed at scale by a computer. Doing this removes some of the clutter that takes up so much cognitive bandwidth, freeing warfighters to focus on higher order processing, gaining situational awareness, understanding enemy plans and developing courses of action. It can also allow military personnel to quickly and effectively perform cognitive tasks that would be difficult or impossible without machine collaboration, and especially without automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To incorporate HMC and HMT, militaries can identify bottlenecks in their operations, delegate tasks to machines as much as possible, and move humans to the boundaries of machine capabilities, where they can undertake the tasks that humans can perform more effectively than machines. Militaries that make the transition to HMC and HMT could make decisions and conduct operations more effectively, more quickly, and on a larger scale than organisations that do not, all at a lower human cost. Though not a panacea, AI can considerably reduce issues surrounding span of control, much as automation does in the context of integrated air and missile defence. To the extent that functions associated with staffs can be automated, staffs can be shrunk – enabling the control of more capabilities at lower echelons. Robots can perform tasks that are too dangerous for humans, such as bomb disposal, generating ISR or attacking in heavily denied airspace, allowing units to perform operations that would not otherwise be feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMC and HMT are not synonymous with full autonomy, which lacks the machine–human interdependence that is HMC and HMT’s defining characteristic. Full autonomy implies systems making decisions with no human intervention beyond design and initiation. HMTs might have autonomous components, but removing one human-to-human or human-to-machine relationship does not eliminate the need for teamwork between humans and machines – and it will not eliminate humans. Rather, it changes where the boundaries within the system lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, HMC and HMT rely on a degree of autonomy to be effective, especially during time-compressed situations or high-intensity conflicts. HMC and HMT can thus serve as stepping stones towards, or catalysts for, driving the pursuit of greater autonomy by helping develop and test capabilities, human–machine interfaces, and the military’s ability to employ semi-autonomous or autonomous systems effectively and responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-will-hmc-and-hmt-affect-warfighting&quot;&gt;How Will HMC and HMT Affect Warfighting?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effect on Casualty Rates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, states are likely to increase the use of machines to minimise casualties and improve operational effectiveness. However, because states have different levels of resources and experience with autonomous technology development, some will significantly outperform others with regard to HMT. If one state manages to overwhelm or bypass its adversary’s machines, it is likely to continue on to attack the human elements of the military, or even the civilian population. This would result in a significant imbalance in casualties between the combatant states, with the advantaged side sustaining few casualties and the disadvantaged side sustaining many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conflicts with more symmetrical HMT usage, the number of casualties that the combatant states sustain would depend on the circumstances of that specific conflict. During limited wars, states could be more likely to seek a negotiated outcome after a large portion of their machines have been neutralised or destroyed, but before they have lost many military personnel and civilians. During more total wars, especially if large numbers of people are mobilised (as is currently being seen in Ukraine), states are likely to continue fighting and thus experience casualty levels similar to those seen in wars without HMT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some caveats here. First, fewer human operators should not be seen as being synonymous with smaller militaries in general – the repair, combat support and sustainment requirements of keeping machines operational could create new roles that are not easily automated, or whose requirements expand with the number of machines. While this could still result in smaller militaries, such an outcome should not be assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, completely symmetrical HMT usage – whether from a capabilities or operational employment standpoint – is unrealistic. The rate of adoption of new technologies, capabilities and operating concepts across militaries – and within their organisation – will be uneven, leading to different rates of change in tempo and scale of operations. Boundaries of adoption across a military’s organisations can create friction, and limit the ability of one state to leverage the full potential of a technology or capability relative to another state. New technologies will also have differential effects on the components of a force, which will likely lead to different levels of hybridisation of HMT and traditional capabilities within individual states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, HMT does not necessarily entail the displacement of existing capabilities. New technologies often change forces by creating arms systems that combine new and existing capabilities. The armoured revolution, for example, did not end the role of infantry, although it did emphasise making them more mobile, and reduced their number as a proportion of the overall force. The future battlefield we might envision, then, is not necessarily one in which today’s platforms and personnel are entirely absent, but one in which, because they are enabled by HMC/HMT, the proportion of the force that they represent is lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, actors that cannot adopt a given mode of warfare will seek to offset it – as those actors incapable of fighting industrial-age warfare did by adopting guerrilla methods. If a smaller cohort of human operators becomes the tactical/operational centre of gravity in the context of HMT, adversaries will have incentives to target them. If this is tactically difficult, the weaker party may resort to means off the battlefield, such as attacking military residential facilities with ballistic missiles (as Iraqi forces did with US barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1991). Alternatively, insurgents who cannot easily target their opponents on the battlefield might pursue systematic assassination campaigns, as in Chechnya and Afghanistan. Increasing the number of digital systems will also increase the number of potential cyber vulnerabilities and attack surfaces adversaries might exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, some experiments have shown a tendency for automated swarms to fight each other to a stalemate. In such circumstances, the deciding factor may well be direct engagements between the human elements of two HMTs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increases in Operational and Strategic Risk Appetite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As HMT capabilities improve, US and UK militaries are likely to shift operational risk to attritable machines whenever possible or appropriate. With this change, commanders can execute previously unacceptable manoeuvres, assured that their own combat losses will mostly consist of machines, not human lives. Commanders could also be expected to fight more determined defences if they were to expect that many of the losses incurred in so doing would be of machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restoration of Mass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMT can help militaries employ lower-cost, easier-to-manufacture machines to overcome complex challenges. Single, exquisite platforms have operational strengths, but also considerable limitations, including lengthy production timelines and high manufacturing costs. Although exquisite systems are by no means obsolete, their capacity would be strained by diverse swarms of inexpensive systems. In one of the first known drone swarm attacks, Houthi rebels in 2019 used 25 drones and cruise missiles to attack Saudi oil processing facilities. These facilities were defended by German Skyguard SAM missiles, which were completely ineffective against the drone swarm. Additionally, when the Saudi air defenders did adjust to the UAV threat, they were forced to expend very expensive interceptors on cheap uncrewed aerial systems. Mass itself, however, will not replace large and complex platforms. Decision-makers will need to consider the appropriate mix of attritable and complex capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massed machines, assigned tasks by their human teammates, could overwhelm traditional defences, often at a relatively smaller cost in human casualties compared to more traditional offensive operations, such as Russia’s use of Shahed-136 drones to exhaust Ukraine’s SAM stockpiles. Machines could also serve as the “eyes and ears” of their human teammates, particularly in urban warfare, by accessing hard-to-reach places, leveraging many different viewpoints, and taking risks that otherwise humans would have to take. One example is Elbit System’s LANIUS drone, a loitering munition outfitted for urban combat. These come complete with beyond-line-of-sight ISR and attack capabilities, an HMT mode with minimal user interaction and a top speed of 45 mph, which gives the user the option for strict ISR use, or the ability to attack a target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be an interaction here between the opportunities afforded by AI and trends that decrease the manufacturing costs of many capabilities, such as UAVs. For example, additive manufacturing may reduce the production timelines for missiles from months to weeks, and drive costs down exponentially. If this is the case, then much of the cost of producing a system might be determined by its sensor package and the necessary levels of integration (though the requirements of physical movement in any domain and the costs entailed will remain). This could drive a substantial divergence between the cost of simpler single-capability systems and larger complex platforms. The former can nonetheless be networked to produce complex results – for example, if multiple platforms with simple sensors cross-reference data to create a single high-fidelity operating picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMT may also change the ratio of humans to machines needed to perform certain tasks, with implications for mass in general. Today, in most cases, many warfighters collectively control one platform, such as a ship. While that relationship is unlikely to vanish, at least two other human–machine relationships are developing that could begin to chip away at the dominant warfighter–platform relationship. One such mode is a small number of warfighters controlling many machines, as seen in examples such as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency’s (DARPA) OFFSET programme, which seeks to enable small infantry teams to act as controllers of up to 250 uncrewed air and ground vehicles each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another, less discussed, relationship is one in which a small number of developers create applications that optimise the performance of many machines and warfighters. This HMC relationship has recently been seen as GIS Art for Artillery (ARTA), a Ukrainian military software program used to distribute fire requests. The software enables multi-gun, multi-munition fire missions at a much faster rate than traditional targeting processes by allowing a machine to develop, interpret and distribute guidance to operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential to combine limited numbers of more specialised warfighters with large numbers of less expensive, uncrewed machines might incentivise a shift away from force structures based around more limited numbers of exquisite platforms. We might see the development of force structures that combine a limited number of expensive platforms and increasing numbers of cheaper, uninhabited platforms that provide mass. This would enable smaller units to cover wider frontages both on land and at sea – a belief central to concepts like the US Navy’s Distributed Maritime Operations framework. This approach will be important, because to survive on a battlefield characterised by long-range fires, forces need to disperse – but to disperse, they need mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that this vision will fail to be realised in all areas. In some cases, machines sufficiently capable of performing important tasks might be expensive, and therefore unlikely to be risked. The costs of platforms in any area often decrease with economies of scale, but the UK and US militaries still must determine whether machines should be viewed primarily as cheap munitions and sources of ISR, or as genuine complements to inhabited platforms. Drones can also experience high attrition rates, even in the absence of sophisticated counter-drone or counter-autonomy systems, and serve as new attack surfaces. With the proliferation of different types of machines, and an increase in their numbers, militaries will need to account for new vulnerabilities while investing in counter-drone technologies that are able to improve faster than drone technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Force Composition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of HMC and HMT will raise questions about the degree of training and specialisation needed for select military tasks. The use of machines will almost certainly require greater expertise for some tasks, driving the need for new career fields in system integration, software development, AI and other areas. Other tasks, however, may require less training when machines help humans perform them. The conflict in Ukraine has shown how non-specialist units can gain lethality by leveraging technology. Other tasks and the personnel associated with them may vanish entirely, as HMC and HMT drive changes in operational concepts and force structure. If the future force involves a limited number of specialists and a much larger number of machines, the emphasis ought to be on recruiting or developing individuals with requisite skills to fill niche roles. If, on the other hand, HMT enables a levée en masse, then greater emphasis might be placed on procuring capabilities that non-specialist personnel can use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Battlefield Awareness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMC and HMT have the potential to increase battlefield awareness in several ways. First, they can expand the number, reach, persistence and type of sensors that the US and UK militaries field and access. For example, machine learning (ML) has enabled the sifting of false positives needed for the acoustic detection of targets like UAVs and helicopters. Second, ML can enable data from existing sensors to be more effectively exploited. For instance, low-frequency active sonar such as that used on T-AGOS ships can detect submarines at very long ranges, but produces too many false positives to be used without incorporating other data. This is another area where ML, in particular, can enable militaries to use the data their sensors are already able to gather, simply by changing the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, non-military sources of data gathering and transmission can become usable. Analysts are increasingly able to absorb and integrate data from non-military sources, such as commercially purchased and open-source datasets, as well as information reported by civilians in combat zones. This volume of data exceeds what human analysts can process. As AI-enabled software increases the speed and quality of analysis by HMTs and the quality of its presentation to military leaders, battlefield awareness and the ability to make data-driven decisions should also improve. Combined with the proliferation of long-range strike capabilities, this could increasingly remove sanctuaries and staging areas from future battlefields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability of fielded forces to operate would rely on a combination of new forms of deception, such as the “poisoning” and evasion approaches used to confound ML algorithms, superior fires, and degrading enemy logistics. Such approaches to deception hinge on feeding opposing algorithms bad data or altering the image presented to them in a way that exploits a known tendency to misclassify certain inputs. For example, deep learning models used in cars can be induced to misclassify road signs through minor alterations, such as adding stickers to the signs. Even as AI continues to advance, it is likely that it will remain possible to deceive it, including in ways that would not deceive human operators. Moreover, blending in to the civilian environment through adaptations like containerising missiles and UAV launch platforms may obviate the risk of detection somewhat – but would increase the risk of civilian casualties. In effect, then, the central focus of deception operations in an era dominated by HMC and pervasive ISR would be hiding in plain sight. It would not be possible to avoid detection, but militaries could prevent their opponents from turning data into useful knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes to Command and Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMC and HMT could make it possible for smaller formations to operate with greater levels of independence. Automating staff functions can empower units that lack large staffs. Without expanding the size of the staff or increasing individuals’ cognitive load, HMC could assist with operational planning, logistics, adjacent unit coordination, and the deconfliction and tasking of assets historically held by higher echelons. This could be of use in information-denied environments where reach-back communications to higher echelons are not always available. A corollary would be that relatively junior officers would be entrusted with greater authority, potentially generating a training need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible, however, that HMC and HMT would help centralise command. Militaries such as China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have, despite some exceptions, emphasised the use of AI-enabled decision aids that help higher echelons of command solve information bottlenecks and exercise more direct control over formations. Confident that resilient communications are achievable and that AI will reduce the risk of information overload, the PLA envisions a high degree of synchronisation through giving theatre-level commanders control of tactical formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which view of command holds greater promise remains to be seen. The choice appears to be between flexible, laterally organised formations that aim for tactical flexibility, and those that deliver victory through tight operational-level coordination. Militaries like the PLA appear to be betting heavily on the latter form of command and control, which could represent a challenge if HMT enables greater local control by commanders but more uncertainty at the systemic level. This is precisely what has occurred in the context of algorithmic trading in financial markets, where the ability to routinise many actions has led to more individual control (and thus complex trading behaviour), in turn leading to greater complexity and uncertainty at the market level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-objectives-of-hmc-and-hmt-integration-in-defence&quot;&gt;II. Objectives of HMC and HMT Integration in Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, there is not always a linear relationship between HMC and HMT and a specific approach to warfighting – how a new technology manifests is mediated by factors including national and organisational culture. Some militaries might use HMC and HMT to enable decentralised activity, for example, while others might see it as a means of ensuring tight central control over a distributed force. This chapter addresses how the UK and the US can best leverage HMC and HMT to enhance the advantages of their own approach to warfare, and to undercut the ways in which opponents might harness the revolution in AI and autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge the UK and the US would face in the eventuality of direct combat with peer competitors, or with near-peer competitors such as China or Russia, is dissimilar to that posed by previous opponents against which the offset strategies of the past century were designed. Against the Soviet Union, the Second Offset leveraged modern precision-strike capabilities to enhance fairly tested concepts of interdiction through airpower. Its success was predicated on building and maintaining technological superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, an opponent like China is likely to become a challenger in terms of both mass and platform quality. The Pentagon’s 2020 China Military Power Report assessed China as having achieved parity with or superiority over the US in several areas, including integrated air defences and land-based precision strike. China enjoys an increasingly competitive position more broadly, for example in areas such as research citations: in 2022, Japan’s National Institute of Science and Technology Policy estimated that China accounted for over 27% of the world’s most frequently cited research that year, overtaking the US. Technological overmatch cannot be the assumed basis for an offset strategy in the same way that it was against a very different opponent in the previous century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the UK, the US and their allies should prepare to overcome an opponent that has near parity in qualitative terms, advantages in both the industrial capacity to replace losses and proximity to likely theatres of conflict, and operational concepts specifically designed to target Western capabilities and operational concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and UK militaries should work with allies to use HMC and HMT to pursue the following objectives as part of a broader offset strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demonstrate the potential to decrease the human, economic and political cost of war for the US and the UK and increase such costs for their adversaries.&lt;/strong&gt; In operating environments in which it is increasingly difficult to gain access or generate mass, shifting operational risk from humans to machines would change the relative cost. Perhaps even more importantly, as US and UK commanders gain freedom of manoeuvre and increase their ability to penetrate contested spaces, the cost of war for the adversary would increase. This would help address any perceptions that states waging expeditionary wars for less than existential ends have limited resolve. Such assessments, accurate or not, may lead an opponent to conclude that all they need to achieve the withdrawal of Western forces is the capacity to inflict a sufficient level of attrition. Even if this assessment of limited resolve is not accurate, the fact that it is held represents a challenge for deterrence, which ultimately hinges on what US and UK competitors believe. Therefore, demonstrating the capacity to limit human costs undercuts a major pillar of opponents’ theories of victory – and thus reinforces deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achieve decision advantage and impose dilemmas on adversaries.&lt;/strong&gt; The use of HMC and HMT allows militaries to increase the degree of operational and tactical unpredictability which their adversaries – with or without their own HMC and HMT capabilities – must address. HMC could improve and accelerate sensing, planning and decision-making and generate more options for action. HMT, having shifted operational risk from humans to machines, would also present commanders with a new and more favourable risk–benefit calculus, and increase the number of options. This is especially true if the machines in question are cheaper single-purpose platforms that can be more readily expended than comparable crewed assets – for example, an extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle (XLUUV) as opposed to a submarine.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Of course, if one assumes technological parity with opponents, success will likely be a function of organisational capacity, rather than technical skill. Organisations better able to interact with the machines at their disposal and to understand the interactions between individuals and machines on the other side are likely to succeed. We might consider how, for example, both Russian and Ukrainian forces have sought to confound one another’s targeting in often subtle ways, for example causing marginal adjustments to GPS coordinates in one another’s systems. Winning engagements has been a function of the ability to identify adversary-induced technical errors early and compensate for them – tasks that will depend on the human component of a force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generate awareness in denied environments.&lt;/strong&gt; The US and UK militaries need to use HMC and HMT to better understand their adversaries’ objectives, intentions and capabilities in order to be able to learn and adapt more quickly in a rapidly evolving operational environment. This may need to occur in the context of information denial, particularly at the tactical level.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At the level of strategic analysis, possible applications might include using deep learning to spot unique or anomalous cases (something traditional deductive models struggle with) or sift large volumes of primary data for patterns. The latter function may be particularly significant, as strategic intelligence failures are usually the product of surplus information, rather than a dearth of it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At the tactical level, autonomy and AI can improve situational awareness in several ways. Autonomous sensors can lie dormant longer than humans, without their attention level decreasing over time and without the need to rest or move. This further frees up personnel for tasks that must be carried out by humans. Autonomous platforms can enable detection at long ranges using sensors such as low-frequency active sonar that currently produce too many false positives to be used alone, and they can also enable targeting based on prediction rather than observation. Furthermore, autonomous platforms carrying sensors can be risked in situations where crewed systems cannot. Another advantage of autonomous systems is that high-risk surveillance that might not be risked with human assets can be countenanced with machine assets. Though they may be lost in combat, such assets are both less costly than crewed ones and, in peacetime, their loss may not be as diplomatically challenging. For example, incidents like the Iranian downing of an RQ-4 Global Hawk in 2019 or the recent confusion surrounding the PLA’s surveillance balloon might be juxtaposed with the downing of Gary Powers’ U-2 or the EP-3 incident.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMC and HMT will help to achieve these broad objectives by helping to accomplish the following six military objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absorb and effectively use ever-increasing volumes of data at the operational and strategic levels.&lt;/strong&gt; The proliferation of military, commercial and privately owned sensors, alongside platforms that encourage data sharing for commercial services and rising internet connectivity, have increased the volume, velocity and diversity of data to a level that humans in operations centres, staff and command positions can no longer track and process. Properly programmed and supervised machines, enabled by a data-sharing regime, are well suited to augment human bandwidth, generating better situational awareness and recommending plans. This could be especially critical in the early phases of a conflict, before circumstances force both sides to adjust, information becomes more contested and old data becomes a wasting asset. The side that begins a conflict with the best available data can shape the conflict’s early, decisive phase. HMC can enable the exploitation of data already within the joint force – much of which is wasted. There is a second way that HMC and HMT can enhance the situational awareness of human operators: by enabling them to get more out of existing sensors. Many existing sensors have the ability to track elusive targets, but they generate false positives – something that can be overcome with ML, which is already being applied to tasks such as radar signal processing. A third way in which machines could enable the use of increasingly advanced commercial capabilities to transfer data is by providing encryption at speed and at a level that would allow data to pass through a commercial network safely. This is already the case with data passed on from the F-35, for example, and could be generalised. Finally, human and autonomous asset teaming can enable more aggressive data gathering in peacetime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a faster, higher-quality decision-making cycle.&lt;/strong&gt; Machines can accelerate decision-making cycles – often framed as observe–orient–decide–act (OODA) loops in military circles – to grant tactical advantage, create more time for planning, and react more quickly to adversary operations or adaptations. Achieving advantage requires controlling tempo and accelerating it where that grants advantage, not just accelerating tempo across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automate routine actions and processes to augment human decision-making.&lt;/strong&gt; Several tasks for field operations, operations centres, planning and sustainment require limited decision-making skill, but absorb a great deal of time. Automating and integrating these processes at scale could free up human bandwidth for more complex tasks, potentially reduce the number of people required for certain components of expeditionary operations, accelerate the planning process, and augment the quality and range of human decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generate physical and virtual effects at scale in heavily denied environments.&lt;/strong&gt; The proliferation of sensors, analytical tools, precision-guided munitions and non-kinetic payloads are fundamentally altering the hider–finder contest, placing traditional massed forces at risk. HMT has the potential to generate mass that can operate in such environments through the employment of prepositioned machines, attritable forces and complex manoeuvres.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overwhelm adversary defences with lower risk to friendly forces.&lt;/strong&gt; Some adversaries have developed anti-access area denial (A2/AD) concepts and capabilities that challenge US and UK power projection. Massed machines, assigned tasks by their human teammates, could overwhelm traditional defences through a combination of sheer volume and attacking on many vectors simultaneously, often at a lower cost in human casualties compared with more traditional offensive operations. They might also supplement crewed platforms by acting as decoys or stand-in jammers. Machines could also serve as the “eyes and ears” of their human teammates, particularly in urban warfare, by helping them gain more information about their environment and taking risks in their place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defeat layered standoff.&lt;/strong&gt; Power projection, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, depends on a limited number of critical nodes including aircraft carriers, airbases and ports. Over the past few decades, adversaries have progressively developed systems to put traditional modes of power projection at risk through the integration of air defence systems and long-range precision strike capabilities designed to counter Western strengths in manoeuvre. Restoring freedom of manoeuvre would require the US and the UK to prevent components of a given system from operating coherently by degrading the system’s functionality. This can be achieved by presenting both platforms and operators with a tempo of activity that they cannot match, and by stressing critical system dependencies – including communication modes, avenues for resupply and operator wellbeing – beyond the point of effectiveness. The more dilemmas a system is presented with, the greater the likelihood that its functionality degrades. HMT can also enable forces that are dispersed and capable of dynamically reconstituting kill chains to mitigate single points of failure, and thus deny opponents the opportunity to benefit from the effects of layered standoff. HMT and HMC can enable the fielding of cheaper, more attritable assets to maintain a constant tempo of pressure, allow kill chains to close more rapidly to facilitate responsive targeting, abet assessments of system functionality, and allow the use of predictive analytics to maintain responsive and agile logistics systems to facilitate a higher tempo of activity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-capabilities-and-enablers-required-to-accomplish-these-goals&quot;&gt;III. Capabilities and Enablers Required to Accomplish These Goals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given competing demands for finite resources, the US and UK militaries should focus, in the near term, on developing, acquiring and fielding a specific group of HMC and HMT capabilities necessary for accomplishing the goals described above. There are tools to improve sensing, analysis, planning and decision-making – for example, to incorporate real-time intelligence and running estimates into planning and simulations. Lower-cost sensing and attack platforms could develop attritable forces, manufactured and subsequently employed at lower cost, that pose a lower level of risk for human operators. By generating more mass, these could facilitate simultaneous attacks in greater numbers, with the desired effect of overwhelming adversary defences. Another use is the uncrewed sustainment of expeditionary forces in contested environments, which could improve the resilience of resupply and increase survivability. Further, (partially) automated computer network attacks can be used against adversary data links and ISR platforms, enhancing operational deception by leading adversary forces astray and disrupting – or even derailing – their operations. Finally, HMC could be leveraged for predictive maintenance: the automation of a range of maintenance and back-office functions could enable more rapid and efficient operations and free up human capacity for other tasks. These are discussed in detail below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priority-military-capabilities&quot;&gt;Priority Military Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools to Improve Sensing, Analysis, Planning and Decision-Making&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and UK militaries could use HMC to accelerate the pace of planning, integrate real-time intelligence and running estimates into planning and simulations, generate more options in a given period of time, and more effectively evaluate the likely outcome of an action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imperative:&lt;/strong&gt; Political leaders and military commanders face a volume, velocity and diversity of data greater than the human ability to process and understand it; this disparity is only likely to increase.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promise:&lt;/strong&gt; Machines offer the opportunity to augment human bandwidth to not only handle this data, but to generate more (and better) courses of action than human planners alone can create, and to help integrate perception and planning across agencies. Machines can process vast amounts and types of data, aggregate it and turn it into useful information, and prioritise it for human decision-making. Machines, particularly unsupervised ML, can also identify novel patterns that humans have not seen (and which, in many cases, humans are unable to identify). Machines can also facilitate the resilient data-sharing networks needed to transmit data in contested environments. For example, NASA’s development of cognitive communications is one avenue for a resilient satellite-based communications system. NASA envisions gathering data from a network of satellites and their collective environment to overcome communication challenges with minimal human interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desired effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Using tools in these ways would improve situational awareness and empower a planning process that is faster, more creative, generates more options, and is better suited to creating a plan optimised for a specific challenge. The ability to plan with smaller headquarters or staff would also enable smaller units, operating in a fragmented and information-denied battlefield, to conduct operations based on horizontal collaboration with those units they can communicate with, rather than relying on top-down direction from higher echelons that may not be possible in denied environments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower-Cost Sensing and Attack Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and UK militaries could develop attritable forces that can be manufactured and employed at lower cost, en masse, and at a lower risk level for human operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imperative:&lt;/strong&gt; Adversaries have developed A2/AD concepts and capabilities that place US and UK forces in certain regions at risk, limiting their operational choices and increasing the probable cost of operations in those regions, at the same time as decreasing their probability of success.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promise:&lt;/strong&gt; Lower-cost, more expendable machines would enable commanders to shift operational risk to machines and execute previously unacceptable manoeuvres or more determined defences, all with the reassurance that their own combat losses will mostly consist of machines, not human lives (or irreplaceable machines). Forces might also be able to generate more mass than they can today, allowing units to attack simultaneously on many vectors and in greater numbers, overwhelming adversary defences. It is important to note, though, that what is being described here is not a force of machines that can be expended with insouciance. Rather, it is a partial reversal of a mid-to-late 20th-century trend towards ever smaller and more expensive platforms (which partially reflected the need to protect smaller numbers of volunteer service personnel). This stands in contrast to the conditions of the early 20th century, when commanders had far more latitude in expending resources. A Sherman tank, for example, was by no means “expendable”, but the numbers in which it was lost on the Western Front in the Second World War (2,700 were lost by the British alone) made it a much more expendable asset than a modern Challenger 2 or M1A2. Programmes to deliver crewed ground vehicles, to continue the example from the land domain, will not create an endless reserve of cheap machines, but their success might be measured in terms of whether they can generate platforms that are as expendable as early 20th century crewed vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desired effect:&lt;/strong&gt; If attritable forces are created in sufficient numbers, massed machines, when assigned tasks by their human teammates, could overwhelm traditional defences, often at a relatively small cost in human casualties compared with more traditional offensive operations. These changes would increase the number of options available to US and UK commanders, and thus an opponent’s operational uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncrewed Sustainment for Expeditionary Forces in Contested Environments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US and UK forces could use HMC and HMT to improve the resilience of their resupply requirements, increase the survivability of flying and shipping and, if necessary, develop attritable resupply capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imperative:&lt;/strong&gt; In a high-intensity conflict with a near-peer adversary, the US and UK militaries can be expected to suffer attacks against their ability to forward deploy forces and sustain them – attacks designed to paralyse the deployed forces and to prevent additional forces from entering the theatre of operation after a conflict has begun.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promise:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to the potential to create sustainment windows of opportunity by overwhelming traditional defences which might target combat support and sustainment, uncrewed systems could be pre-positioned or moved into theatre to resupply US and UK forces. A combination of uncrewed capabilities used for lift and automated planning could also help resolve one of the major challenges to sustainment – sustaining a dispersed force. Concentrated logistical nodes, although vastly more vulnerable, are currently preferred due to the challenges of planning and delivering logistical support to dispersed capabilities. Automation and AI could substantially reduce this burden by simplifying the process of planning and enabling sustainment to occur without the need for large numbers of crewed platforms. This could simplify tasks such as dispersing aircraft to mitigate the risks that adversary cruise and ballistic missiles pose.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desired effect:&lt;/strong&gt; If the US and UK militaries were able to sustain their operations using HMC and HMT in these ways, they could continue fighting at a higher level of intensity for longer, inflicting greater losses and increasing their adversary’s uncertainty, thus weakening the adversary’s ability to gain military advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Operational Deception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deceiving adversarial forces would reduce US and UK losses and strengthen forces’ ability to penetrate adversary spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imperative:&lt;/strong&gt; As mentioned in the context of the capabilities discussed above, adversaries are increasingly able to deny the US and UK militaries access to theatres, reducing their ability to mass force or achieve decisive results using conventional means.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promise:&lt;/strong&gt; HMC and HMT can (partially) automate computer network attacks against adversary data links and ISR platforms. AI can identify weaknesses in software or security programmes, while HMT can also enable feints in both physical and electromagnetic spaces and set the conditions for maintaining communications in the face of adversary disruption – for example, by more rapidly identifying which parts of the spectrum an opponent is seeking to deny (and thus which parts of the spectrum adversary forces are using). HMC can improve operational planning, including deception planning, particularly against other systems that leverage machines. Strategies for poisoning an opponent’s ML algorithms or hiding in plain sight require an understanding of how an opponent’s AI draws inferences based on decisions made. Understanding how an opposing AI works (and how it might be overcome) is thus one area where HMC can be applied.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desired effect:&lt;/strong&gt; If the US and UK militaries can use HMC and HMT to enhance operational deception in these ways, they should be able to lead adversary forces astray; disrupting or derailing their ongoing operations, and injecting uncertainty about the validity of reports, intelligence analysis and vital systems performance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage HMC for Predictive Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automating a range of maintenance and back-office functions could enable more rapid and efficient operations and free up human capacity for other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imperative:&lt;/strong&gt; High-intensity or long operations, and long and complex supply lines, require efficient and anticipatory maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promise:&lt;/strong&gt; Automation and digitisation have the potential to predict attrition and repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desired effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Enable the US and UK militaries to enhance and harden logistics operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-enablers-do-the-us-and-uk-militaries-require-for-the-adoption-and-employment-of-hmc-and-hmt&quot;&gt;What Enablers Do the US and UK Militaries Require for the Adoption and Employment of HMC and HMT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMC and HMT will not emerge and operate in a vacuum. Their incorporation by the US and UK militaries will heavily depend on critical enablers within the US Department of Defense (DoD) and the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD), broader government institutions, and a diverse external ecosystem. The most important enabling factors are discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Operating Concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military personnel collaborating with machines can break problems into their component pieces and instruct machines to optimise, automate and perform tasks at scale, allowing the HMT to make decisions and conduct operations more effectively, more quickly and on a larger scale than humans alone can do. But militaries are unlikely to make this transition without changing their operating concepts to account for the speed and scale machines provide. If militaries attempt to use machines to simply augment or replace human performance, they are likely to secure only a fraction of the possible benefits of HMC and HMT. In addition to not deriving the competitive advantages they might enjoy if they properly employed their tools, commands that do not experience the benefits will not be as incentivised to adopt the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three considerations should characterise the operating concepts that drive HMC and HMT adoption. The concepts must be linked to a specific military problem and connected to a recognisable model of operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most major innovation cycles begin as a response to a well-delineated challenge. The precision-strike revolution in Western militaries that began with the Second Offset, for example, started as a solution to the challenge of defeating the Soviet second echelon. It then gained much wider currency as the broader implications became apparent. However, the revolution in military affairs did not begin with a broad theory of change; rather, it came about as a solution to a very specific problem. This is true of other innovations, such as the interwar Japanese Navy’s adoption of carrier warfare to offset its disadvantages in battleship tonnage. In the case of HMC and HMT, the central orienting challenge should be overcoming layered standoff and enabling both theatre entry and manoeuvre. This is by no means their only potential application, but linking the development of HMC and HMT to a challenge that will be critical to every Western service against peer and near-peer competitors should ensure clear and well-supported lines of effort in developing concepts and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New concepts of operations should be linked to recognisable principles for action in order to be readily understood and adopted. Interwar Germany’s rapid adoption of armoured warfare, for example, was partially driven by the fact that many of its tenets, such as infiltration and manoeuvre at depth, were already embodied in First World War stormtrooper tactics. Tanks were added into an existing concept of operations (CONOPS) that they substantially changed, but without which their role might not have been understood. In effect, the German army reached the right conclusions about technology because its pre-existing critical task focus and concepts were well suited to doing so. Today, elements of the US and UK joint forces that have particularly well-aligned CONOPS and are task focused should be prioritised as accelerators for the adoption of HMC and HMT in the context of achieving theatre entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective Interfaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective teaming depends on a two-way flow of information and robust cognitive and behavioural models of the agents involved. With the progress of machine intelligence from tools to peers, human–machine interfaces will require increasingly advanced social intelligence in machines to support complex interactions and coordination demands between the agents. Optimising this interface requires machines to build accurate mental models of human teammates in dynamic and ambiguous operational contexts. For humans, integration is contingent on trust and confidence in their machine counterpart’s ability to execute goals safely and reliably to achieve advantage over adversaries. To improve the transparency and value of the interface, human operators need to understand the interdependencies and respective capabilities of human and machine agents in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The degree to which human operators require an explanation of the workings behind a machine’s output depends on contextual factors like time sensitivity and the level of operator accountability for actions taken. Moreover, the extent to which a machine’s working can be simply explained under different contextual conditions should be made a design criterion at early stages of development. It has also been suggested that end users be involved in the early stages of interface development so that they can offer feedback on matters such as the graphic user interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workforce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US National Security Commission on AI’s Interim Report included an AI Workforce Model. Developed in partnership with the Joint AI Center and the Defense Innovation Board, the model outlines workforce requirements for the DoD. While intended to address AI, this model applies equally well to HMC and HMT. It calls for the DoD to develop three archetypes at different skill levels for the technical workforce – AI expert, AI developer and deployment specialist – and four archetypes for the non-technical workforce – end user, tactical leader, strategic leader and support roles. According to the model, adequate support for all seven archetypes will produce the technical workforce needed to build and field HMC and HMT, the strategic leaders needed to make policy and resource decisions, the tactical leaders and end users needed to employ HMTs, and the support roles needed to staff the acquisition, legal, and personnel systems. With this talent in place, the US and UK militaries would be much more likely to effectively develop, field and employ HMC and HMT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the expertise needed to train personnel in these roles may already exist within the force. For example, the operators of air defence systems such as Aegis destroyers/cruisers are among the more experienced end users of automated capabilities in the military. They have had to grapple with considerations like setting parameters for a system rather than directly controlling it, interpreting incoming data from a system, cross-referencing it with a commander’s judgement, and deciding how much autonomy to allow a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other categories, it may be necessary for militaries to rely on other models to source and retain talent. For example, private contractors might be one avenue through which militaries can reach out to qualified individuals without directly paying salaries that would void the pay/rank relationship. Given the substantial levels of contractorisation that have already occurred in Western militaries, this need not be a great leap. Use of reserve units might be another way of attracting qualified individuals without denying them their full earning potential. Countries such as Israel have succeeded in making postings in specialised units such as Unit 8200 (Israel’s SIGINT and cyber unit) sought-after jobs because of the private sector opportunities the unit’s alumni enjoy following a limited period of service. Reserve units could build links with the private sector to be similarly effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethical Guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deployment of HMTs in increasingly complex and ambiguous environments requires machines to negotiate ethically challenging situations in which decisions have many consequences, including for human safety. Meaningful human control over systems and morally consequential decision-making remains critical, but the appropriate degree of autonomy will vary across missions. Militaries need to not only calibrate the tradeoff between control and autonomy in ethical HMT design, but also to define the parameters for dynamically adjusting this calibration to different situational contexts. Developing ethical models for systems will be particularly important in situations where machines exercise a high degree of autonomy. Models should account for the moral reasoning of multiple human and non-human agents interacting in an evolving environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structured Spaces for HMC and HMT Experimentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experimentation is helpful for the development of both capabilities and new employment techniques/operational concepts. Experimental spaces should replicate realistic environments so that operators and technologists can experiment with and rapidly iterate technology to develop its optimal use across situational contexts. Locations such as the US’s Joint Readiness Center, the National Training Center and the Joint Multinational Readiness Center already provide realistic environments. High-fidelity simulations also offer opportunities to quickly iterate experiments, especially in preparation for real-world scenarios. To field new capabilities quickly, the operators and technologists should also be tightly connected to industry and to the acquisition systems of the US and UK militaries. Where possible, collaboration between allies could shorten these experimentation and acquisition cycles and enable further integration between them in the future. But to achieve this, classification differences that have hampered cooperation efforts in other domains would need to be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fielded Experimentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current processes for upgrading and using legacy systems are too slow to produce rapid adaptations to tactics on the battlefield. Driving innovation into existing weapon systems at the speed of relevance requires a new experimental paradigm, with operators continually testing capabilities in the field to build trust, developing metrics of effectiveness and updating capabilities in real time to make behaviours unpredictable. Fielding high-fidelity simulations of AI-enabled systems at the tactical edge, developing operator-focused analysis tools to evaluate risks and opportunities provided by new HMT tactics, and deploying synthetic data generation to adapt systems using in-situ collected data would enable battlefield operators to create on-demand tactics and rapidly deploy capabilities in response to a dynamic threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acquisition Reform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and UK militaries both need to develop more effective ways to work with industry to create capabilities. This entails addressing well-known issues with the acquisition process, programme risk and efficiency approaches to position the military–industrial–academic complex to learn and develop capabilities in real time as part of an action–reaction–counteraction cycle. Experimental spaces would also help to improve collaboration between military users and civilian-led technologists early in the development phase to identify necessary capabilities and improve the path to production and fielding, particularly at scale. The current defence infrastructure is not set up for the appropriate scaling and will need to be adapted to move technologies beyond the experimentation phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key adaptations must include incentives that make it appealing for a company to invest in technology at technology readiness level (TRL) 1. Target margins for companies specialising in AI-enabled military solutions may be up to 25% of costs – well more than the margins that defence contracts typically deliver. This disparity of expectation will be compounded by the tendency of defence departments to insist on intellectual property (IP) ownership. Solutions might include exploring the role of institutions such as the British Business Bank in delivering long-term R&amp;amp;D funding to technology at lower TRL levels. Payments could also be made on a “stages of intent” basis, thus reducing the risk to companies depending on an uncertain contract award. Finally, direct state ownership stakes in critical companies might be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-guiding-principles-for-the-implementation-of-hmc-and-hmt&quot;&gt;IV. Guiding Principles for the Implementation of HMC and HMT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translating the vision articulated above into tangible outcomes will depend on several factors, including political support for efforts to leverage autonomy, reforms to processes surrounding acquisition and the institutionalisation of fielded experimentation within a country’s armed services. The challenge is multiscale and will require many stakeholders’ simultaneous engagement. This chapter highlights the ways in which different stakeholders within the policy process, and at various levels, can drive change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-political-and-strategic-drivers-of-hmc-and-hmt-adoption&quot;&gt;The Political and Strategic Drivers of HMC and HMT Adoption&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political and senior civilian and military leaders must provide a clear vision and direction for implementation to lead the digital transformation. In democracies, policymakers often provide strategic direction to (and oversight of) militaries without engaging with the details of military change, which tends to be viewed as the domain of the specialist. While this is understandable, policymakers taking an active interest in force transformation is often a prerequisite for successful adaptation and evolution. Without suggesting that political leaders attempt to direct the tactical details of how militaries leverage HMC and HMT, this chapter outlines ways in which they can galvanise the process of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define Vision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving HMC and HMT as part of the digital age’s transformation of the art and science of defence and security requires a well-defined vision. HMC and HMT must be cast as part of a “grand design”, not left to random experimentation at the fringes. Senior leaders in the defence establishment must articulate a vision of warfighting at the scale needed to win a great power war, then communicate it and resource it aggressively to spur services to implement HMC and HMT as an integral part of the solution to the operational challenges facing the US, the UK and their allies. Leadership must articulate the pressing threat, and how HMC and HMT can be employed to address it. The poor framing of operational challenges can cause bureaucratic elements to withdraw the support that is critical to overcoming the “valley of death” in implementation. Leaders could find themselves having to justify cuts to existing capabilities to enable change, which requires political capital and bureaucratic support to achieve in the face of organisational inertia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realising a well-defined organisational vision can also require a certain ruthlessness. Consider, for example, the controversies that accompanied the early 20th century dreadnought revolution, which was enabled by cuts to the Royal Navy’s fleet of pre-dreadnought battleships, many of which were scrapped. Notably, the methods that Admiral Fisher used to defend and sustain change, including relatively centralised decision-making using small groups and a willingness to weather external criticism, might be at odds with contemporary managerial standards. This dynamic is mirrored in the careers of other successful reformers, such as Admiral Rickover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration with Other Strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development and employment of HMC and HMT must be integrated components of a broad strategy, rather than being left to experimentation in small, disparate programmes. As the Second Offset illustrates, holding service-level programmes to a centrally defined strategy can be the best way to both deliver the value of a coherent central vision and give services the latitude to propose their own programmes. However, it would be a mistake to assume that strong personalities like former US Secretary of Defense Harold Brown will always be at the helm to drive this kind of process – relying on remarkable individuals leaves too much to chance. There should be an institutional basis for ensuring alignment with an overall vision. Organisations such as the UK’s Strategic Command, which currently plays a role as a technical integrator, could take on the function of ensuring overall coherence as an institutional imperative. Organisations that play this role can also share innovation across services and combine service-level initiatives where appropriate. One might consider, as a commercial analogue, the role that organisations like Japan’s MITI have played in guiding collaboration between companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Articulate Priority Capability Categories, with an Initial Emphasis on Enhancing Existing Force Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any implementation plan should articulate a list of priority capability categories for HMC and HMT, such as the provision of low-cost sensing and the enablement of dispersion through automated planning. Buy-in will depend either on the cooperation of the owners of legacy assets or on their being effectively sidelined. While figures such as Admiral Fisher managed to sideline their opponents, this may not always be viable. The highest levels of buy-in are attained when an innovation appears to enhance, rather than to replace, existing kit. For example, aircraft carriers were initially “sold” to battleship admirals using the argument that aircraft could act as spotters for battleships, while vertical lift achieved buy-in because it was seen as enabling existing concepts of cavalry manoeuvre. Consider these adaptations to secure buy-in as examples of “single loop learning”, in which an organisation’s existing way of doing things is made more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial buy-in can set the conditions for more revolutionary long-term change by, among other things, opening promotion avenues for reform-minded officers. In HMC and HMT command and control, ISR and counter-ISR are areas where machines can augment, rather than supplant, existing capability. It is these areas that should be prioritised first, with the use of lethal and expendable platforms (a more politically and organisationally challenging area) initially deferred to a second phase of exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questioning Assumptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assumptions made about the development of capabilities need to be carefully interrogated, including the continued reliability of internet connectivity for military and civilian capabilities, the resilience of uncrewed systems, opportunities to collect or generate data required for ML, and the expertise required of humans and machines to perform tasks linked to an operational concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One major barrier to innovation and change is the fear of being perceived to be wasting public money. Bureaucracies are often set up to avoid waste – a potentially virtuous function – but in doing so, they can impede the levels of experimentation needed to drive change. However, politicians and the public need not be an impediment to expenditure on high-risk, high-reward ventures – indeed, in important cases like the space race or the building of the dreadnought, they drove the process. Winning the support of politicians and the public can undermine a major rationale for opposition to change – the argument that the levels of experimentation needed to support change will be deemed financially frivolous. For example, we might think of the 1957 exercise in which the USS Nautilus, then the world’s only nuclear-powered submarine (SSN), “sank” a great deal of the Royal Navy. The intended audience for the exercise was not the Navy (which already understood the value of SSNs), but the secretary of state for defence, Duncan Sandys, who had been invited to attend and who subsequently offered wider political support for a British SSN in the face of Treasury opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development and adoption of HMC and HMT require the involvement of stakeholders outside of the DoD and the MoD. Defence leaders must engage, and at times inform, their governments and the public. Building coalitions of support beyond the services and defence establishment is one way in which the initial momentum of programmes can be sustained. This was well known to successful reformers like Hyman Rickover, who was careful to cultivate relationships with both Congress and the press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engagement with Legislators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid many competing priorities, the DoD and the MoD must convey the urgency of HMC and HMT implementation to legislators in terms of the potential costs of failure. The war in Ukraine has showcased the importance of HMC and HMT by presenting a concrete and easily comprehended set of operational challenges that make a clear case for their implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politicians and the wider public should also be engaged in a wider strategy of re-industrialisation. Commentators have discussed how, in different areas, some of the enabling technologies that can drive rapid production (such as additive manufacturing and automated production lines) can drive the partial reshoring of manufacturing capacity. If this is the case, the production of expendable capabilities, which could require less specialised knowledge than manufacturing legacy assets, could be tied to wider national industrial strategies and so reinvigorate economically flagging areas in the UK and the US. Legislative buy-in, meanwhile, could give HMC and HMT the political protection that, for example, shipbuilding enjoys in both the UK and the US. To achieve this, however, procurement standards for expendable capability will need to be more permissive than those for crewed assets – enabling investment in generating these capabilities to be viewed as part of a virtuous cycle with spillovers into the civilian economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Engagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing new and advanced technologies is not simply an issue of technology, but also involves policy and legislative direction. Successful policy, especially in areas that require organisational change or significant private sector engagement, often requires public engagement. The DoD and the MoD need to improve how they engage with the public – especially when technologies are being driven by the commercial sector – and help it understand the imperative of rapidly developing and adopting HMC and HMT capabilities. This includes prioritising accessibility over technical details when drafting documents for public distribution, as well as highlighting areas where HMC and HMT have previously been operationalised and been of benefit. “Easy wins” in terms of communication can be sought in descriptions of technologies that help shield troops from harm, such as bomb disposal robots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Where to Implement Incremental Adaptation and Where to Push for Transformational Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incremental change is necessary when achieving progress relies on gaining the buy-in of services and industry while still maintaining readiness and overall deterrence. Winning in future conflicts, however, requires transformation, and managed transition may be insufficient to encourage the DoD and MoD to drop enough legacy systems for transformation to take place. The DoD and MoD need a plan for transitioning from yesterday’s icons in favour of dedicating programme resources for the short to long term to build a process, not hold an event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means pursuing implementation on a two-track process: (a) incremental change, such as by identifying existing platforms or munitions to improve during development and combat; and (b) immediate transformational change, which might involve more bruising organisational change. Success stories can be created, and thus evidence of effectiveness communicated, through testing and modelling/wargaming with inbuilt HMT and HMC capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pace at which change needs to occur may not be even across the domains or levels of warfare. The change strategy opted for could, then, be contextually determined. In some cases, direct (and unpopular) cuts by top leadership to existing force structure to fund new a capability may be necessary – like those imposed on the Royal Navy during the dreadnought revolution. Such an approach tends to benefit from more top-down leadership. In other cases, where the pace of change is less breakneck and the truly revolutionary implications of new technology are more unclear, incrementalism may be called for. An example is the carrier revolution, in which battleship admirals were reassured about their position in the emerging force structure. This approach hedged against risks because the implications of carrier warfare were not clear and only emerged 20 years after the first tests of aircraft at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this implies that a categorisation of areas that require incremental/transformational change should precede decisions on both the approach taken to specific programmes and the choices regarding programme managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bureaucratic-and-organisational-change&quot;&gt;Bureaucratic and Organisational Change&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Militaries will adopt new technologies or capabilities at uneven rates across their organisations, causing the tempo and scale of operations to change at different rates. These boundaries of adoption can create friction and limit capabilities. To overcome them, the DoD and MoD need to focus on driving behavioural, not cultural, change, because behaviour is more instrumental and controllable, and will gradually feed cultural change. As an example, rather than attempting to create a risk-tolerant culture, the DoD and MoD should establish processes that force or strongly encourage some programmes to fail without ending a programme manager’s career, such as portfolio management. A process of adaptation will need to take place, aided by the development of new and evolved organisations that embrace shock, surprise and new forms of organising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section will describe some of the priorities on which such a process should be focused to deliver a positive feedback loop of self-reinforcing change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Internal Competition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Militaries will need to manage budgetary competition between the services, as well as the tension between those focused on the combatant commands’ immediate high-readiness capabilities and those looking to generate capability over the medium to long term. Further tensions may result from the way that HMC and HMT blend parochial service roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two potential approaches to managing competition for a common good. First, control can be centralised in a service-level organisation – as the US has done for space-based C4ISR in the Space Force, and China has for ISR more broadly in the Strategic Support Force. The demand signal from individual services can be mediated by a body that must be appropriately empowered (authority, capacity and resources) so that it is not junior, or beholden to any service, such as the Third Offset’s Advanced Capabilities Development Panel, or the National Security Commission on AI’s recommendation to establish a tri-chair panel. Second, services can be allowed to make budgetary decisions, with the role of the strategic integrator being to prune ideas inconsistent with the offset vision – as was the case in the Harold Brown years in the US DoD, where the offers of individual services were assessed based on their congruence with the vision of the Second Offset. Authority remains a critical success factor if the integrator is to shape the design of the force from the start (rather than merely integrate the forces it is given).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interservice competition can, if properly managed, have virtuous effects in terms of services being compelled to ensure their approaches are in fact competitive and expedite the evolutionary process. Here, we might consider the example of how aviation benefited from competition between multiple companies in its early days. Alternatively, services can be given the freedom to expend resources, so long as their expenditure can demonstrate coherence with a precise vision. This was the case in the era of the Second Offset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The degree to which internal competition is desirable is proportionate to the clarity of the underlying vision. If a vision gives the services clear joint goals, giving them the latitude to make resource decisions may make sense. However, if a vision is not sufficiently defined – and thus open to being interpreted by services in ways that justify their desired programmes – a central arbiter who can identify obvious parochialism may be necessary. An approach where the standardisation of certain elements is performed centrally certainly has historical precedent – consider, for example, how the US Navy’s NIFC-CA was predicated on inserting standardisation requirements into pillar programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarify and Raise the Risk Threshold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bureaucratic risk threshold for using new technologies is often unknown, and overall risk tolerance needs to increase, especially for middle management, if technology is to be adopted at scale within relevant timeframes. While leaders are taught at junior levels to nurture innovation and identify acceptable failure, they are not taught how to continue doing so once they become middle managers, where the risk environment is different. The question, then, is how to counter the conservative instincts of middle managers, who often see themselves as the means by which organisational risk is mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way of altering behaviour is to change the cues that drive it, rather than altering incentive structures. Most individuals are driven by a degree of inertia which can be manipulated – for example, people are much more likely to benefit from a social programme if it has a voluntary “opt out” mechanism rather than operating on an “opt in” basis. In this model, reporting requirements for the rejection of a given proposal or the slow pace of a programme might be made more onerous, for example. Social cues, such as beliefs about the wider organisation, can also drive emulation – suggesting that highlighting the stories of high performers can drive wider change. People tend to be motivated by the actions of individuals within their social locus. Valorising examples from the private sector is thus unlikely to motivate a state employee, while publicising examples of change being driven within the military may have a greater effect. Finally, rewards and punishments for the responsible owners of programmes might be reframed to incentivise justifiable risk, rather than being predominantly based on outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create an Infrastructure that Enables Risk-Taking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DoD and the MoD can incentivise the use of structured spaces for HMC and HMT experimentation (discussed above in the section on “enablers”) as dedicated spaces for trialling and prototyping high-risk capabilities. Through proper rewards, these spaces could lead to an inventory of innovative and proven operational concepts and technologies, developed during peacetime, which could be rapidly deployed off the shelf in response to the next crisis. It is unlikely to be possible to innovate if, as is currently the case, flying a UAV in a testing ground like Salisbury Plain requires an elaborate permissions process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing experimental spaces, the DoD and MoD must articulate a clear risk threshold for technology implementation: such thresholds are often unknown, which stifles risk-taking. The DoD and MoD can also set a predetermined failure rate for a defined set of programmes to increase risk tolerance, and should be prepared to reapportion funds based on the expectation of failure. In response to failure, they must be prepared to reward people for taking reasonable risk, even when their programmes have proven to be unsuccessful. The DoD and MoD can also exploit lessons learned from partially successful or even failed experiments and leverage subcomponent technologies that emerge from projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define Impactful Metrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is often the case that senior leaders have a vision for an outcome but lack an accountability system to track progress and act as a forcing function to drive HMC and HMT implementation throughout the services. The DoD and MoD must build an ecosystem or accountability structure, with reportable and context-appropriate metrics, for the adoption of HMC and HMT capabilities and their impact. Given the diversity of tasks and contexts in which HMC and HMT can be applied, and where their integration is tracked, creating a variety of metrics that capture the context of specific applications is important. Because metrics can be interpreted in different ways, the DoD and MoD must clearly define metrics such that they lead to shared evaluation of performance by all parts of the organisation. These metrics must not only be measurable but also meaningful and observable in impact, not simply in outcome – which may not be relevant to the goal of transformation. Abstracted metrics could include consistency with offset priorities, military effectiveness, affordability, interoperability, adaptability, coherence, exportability and ecosystem capability. Another potential metric might be the degree to which a given capability relies on commercial off-the-shelf technology, although this might not be applicable in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;development&quot;&gt;Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DoD and MoD must consider how technology changes over time and how to best upgrade and use legacy systems without limiting their ability to adapt. This entails identifying specific platforms that could be improved, and determining the expertise needed to meet mission requirements effectively. Building capability to perceive and leverage emerging opportunities across the force may represent readiness and advantage over time. Some of the factors involved are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with design.&lt;/strong&gt; It will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to adopt new capabilities by using today’s force structure. Instead of starting with force structure and then moving to design, it is best to start with an operational need and use that to inform force structure while pursuing new capabilities. The implications of this approach span doctrine, organisation, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities with cost awareness. Militaries should also design interfaces for ease of human use and adaptability, not just for end function.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop iterative design and experimentation processes.&lt;/strong&gt; The DoD and MoD must develop an iterative design and experimentation process that enables rapid and continual adoption, deployment and adaptation of HMC and HMT capabilities at scale. Design and experimentation, foremost, must focus on goals and constraints, rather than on specific techniques that would work in certain contexts and fail in others, and account for the differential effect of components as they come onboard. Doing so will help the DoD and MoD integrate new technologies over time, and upgrade and maximise the value of legacy systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build data infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt; Leveraging the full potential of HMT requires an integrated digital data and infrastructure stack. Identifying and using surrogate data sources would also help to inform and generate data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).&lt;/strong&gt; Adaptation at the rate needed for effective performance in combat requires a combination of field experimentation, scenario-informed testing and CI/CD. CI/CD is particularly difficult for the types of operations militaries must execute. A tiered approach by which the DoD and MoD create the ability to adapt, then increase such adaptation over time, towards a combination of fielded development and CI/CD, would help improve capabilities and modernise most effectively. This might be much more viable for single-purpose platforms than for crewed multi-purpose ones. As such, should the UK and the US achieve a data architecture sufficiently open and modular in crewed platforms, the capabilities these platforms are teamed with can be improved at pace. This has been achieved, to an extent, by services such as the Royal Danish Navy, which has made modularity a core design principle. However, it does mean that where the demands of modularity clash with platform performance in the immediate term, the former objective is to be given priority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achieve scale.&lt;/strong&gt; Western militaries’ capabilities have been limited by the inability to field systems at scale. It is deceptively easy to launch AI pilot programmes with impressive results, but fiendishly difficult to deliver scaled final results. It should be noted, however, that quality defeats quantity in certain contexts, and some HMC and HMT capabilities may not require scale to be significant. Drones in Ukraine, for example, experienced a high attrition rate even in the absence of sophisticated counter-drone and counter-autonomy systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure interoperability and interchangeability.&lt;/strong&gt; The DoD and MoD must design HMC and HMT systems with architecture that facilitates interoperability, interchangeability and fusion between systems, platforms and programmes across the services (and which are compatible with allies’ systems). This will require decision-making at the beginning of the procurement process and communication to industry about which partners will be part of the process. In the past, senior leadership-driven programmes such as the UK’s Defence Innovation Initiative and the Strategic Capabilities Office proved to be successful models for breaking down firewalls and fusing capabilities across the services to deliver new and improved capabilities. Senior DoD and MoD leadership must similarly intervene to establish an office (or other institutional mechanisms) that can fuse capabilities and special access programmes from across the services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Differences in classification levels impose another challenge for interoperability across allies and partners. The DoD and MoD must experiment with eliminating or suspending regulations that impede interoperability/interchangeability, engage in NATO standardisation agreements early, and integrate HMC and HMT into the NATO force model and 2023 family of plans to increase the probability of relevance and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage modelling and simulations.&lt;/strong&gt; Modelling and simulations can serve as powerful tools for rapidly developing and deploying HMC and HMT tactics and capabilities that empower the warfighter. The DoD and MoD must explore ways to: use modelling in large, complex simulations of the operating environment; field high-fidelity simulations of AI-enabled systems at the tactical edge; and use synthetic image generation to adapt systems using in-situ collected data to enable battlefield operators to create on-demand tactics and rapidly deploy HMC and HMT capabilities. In addition, the models need to incorporate as many details about the systems in question as possible. Models that make assumptions about systems, such as their inherent vulnerabilities, could have a counterproductive effect if they are then used to inform policy and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emphasise the user interface.&lt;/strong&gt; The DoD and MoD must also emphasise the ease of human use and adaptability in the design of interfaces, not just the end function of these systems. This includes the design of analysis tools to be operator-focused so that it is possible to continually evaluate risks and successes of new HMC and HMT tactics in the field. Iterative field experiments that gradually reduce errors and improve understanding of the boundary conditions of technologies can also help to generate trust and accelerate HMC and HMT adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pursue industrial policy.&lt;/strong&gt; Industrial policy matters as much as military concept: inventory and production capacity must match the rate and endurance of use. The DoD and MoD need to improve their ability to integrate systems with wider government policy. Nesting acquisition within industrial policy, such as “friendshoring”, is one way to circumvent budgetary challenges. Competitors are able to provide insurance against risk to private sector actors via industrial policies that include subsidies. While direct subsidisation is likely to be politically difficult in the UK and the US, incentives such as tax breaks for smaller companies may be more acceptable. There could also be a substantial role for larger defence primes to act as acquisition hubs and as portfolio managers for smaller firms (given that the latter are unlikely to generate economies of scale quickly).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experimentation.&lt;/strong&gt; The systems deployed today are not necessarily the same systems that are used to fight tomorrow, and experimentation is key to identifying the most impactful capabilities and outputs to win the next conflict. Given the speed of innovation and adaptation on the battlefield, new experimental paradigms are needed to iterate quickly, update tactics and generate new tools at the speed of relevance. Experiments should focus on goals and constraints, rather than on specific techniques (which will work in certain contexts and fail in others), and account for the differential effect of components as they come on board. Processes and regulations should also be the subject of experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generate options through modelling.&lt;/strong&gt; Generative models provide another powerful set of tools for developing “course of action” options. Experimentation should first involve modelling in large, complex simulations of the operating environment with physical, human, cognitive and resources layers, or a single synthetic environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create on-demand tactics.&lt;/strong&gt; Fielding high-fidelity simulations of AI-enabled systems at the tactical edge and using in-situ collected data would enable battlefield operators to rapidly deploy capabilities. Developing operator-focused analysis tools to evaluate risks and successes of new HMT tactics and fielding experiments to reduce errors and understand the boundary conditions of a technology are critical to generating trust in systems and their outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;private-sector-partnership&quot;&gt;Private Sector Partnership&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s talent will focus on their current problems more than transformative new capabilities and their potential. Militaries need to consider how technology changes organisation and processes – including the human component, which needs more attention in both the US and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several steps can be taken to generate synergies between the public sector and private industry. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrating civilian expertise.&lt;/strong&gt; Competition for talent is extremely fierce. The DoD and MoD need the right talent across their organisations to make effective – not just deeply technical – decisions, but there is no flood of talent appearing, and Defence is not positioned to recruit the best talent. The DoD and MoD need to develop more effective mechanisms to integrate out-of-government expertise into government decision-making. This could be achieved with individual personnel by implementing secondments and rotations between government roles and private industry, as well as processes of co-creation, allowing for an exchange between technical experts and domain operators, with benefits accumulating over time to both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another mechanism to draw on civilian expertise might be the better leveraging of reserves. If reserve forces were treated as a pool of talent that serves in the military on a part-time basis, rather than purely as a means of replacing combat mass, they could be a valuable national asset. This model has been demonstrated to be effective in countries such as Israel. There is already some experience with this in the UK, which established the Joint Cyber Reserve Force. Such an approach requires the careful management of demands on an individual’s time, as many of the personnel whose skills are being sought will have considerable professional obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the private sector might offer avenues. Private military companies (PMCs), for example, can potentially pay skilled individuals far more than militaries can, and can in principle act as incubators for adaptation and change if supported by state investment. Of course, this raises broader issues regarding regulating their activities in third-party states. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of PMCs such as Military Professional Resources Inc in achieving tasks that have eluded many Western militaries (such as completing successful advise-and-assist missions with a light footprint) suggests that they offer an avenue to tap and retain talent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fuel industry–government experimentation.&lt;/strong&gt; The military relies on civilian sector machines, datasets and infrastructure. An experimental centre or command environment for collaboration between functional and technical expertise would help to not only bridge the gap between military users and civilian-led technologists but also to better leverage private sector data. Partnered experimentation and training between armed forces and industry should be fuelled by government cash, and not just by industrial goodwill. Initiatives of this kind should also highlight the imperative of positioning the military–industrial–academic complex to learn in real time, within conflicts, as part of the action–reaction–counteraction cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reform the acquisition process.&lt;/strong&gt; More effective relationships between government and technology companies will also be key to overcoming well-known issues with the acquisition process. The DoD and the MoD should establish open-standard acquisition with industry to create rapid spiral development, not leisurely episodic fleet changes. This involves making space for original equipment manufacturers and start-ups (without being seduced by either). It must be recognised that the time taken to bring a new technology to the higher TRLs means that it is simply not viable for smaller entities to compete in the defence sphere. One way this could be circumvented is if large defence primes act as portfolio managers – purchasing smaller entities at a pace which means that their investments can pay off before the technology has matured to MoD/DoD standards. Incentive structures for defence primes will need to be adjusted to achieve this. While some tools, such as tax cuts, might be too politically fractious, other policy instruments, such as direct state investment in research and development, which already occurs to a significant extent in the medical sector, might be an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This policy guide demonstrates the extent to which HMC and HMT are essential for Western militaries. A combination of capable individuals – particularly at junior levels – and both AI and autonomy enables concepts of manoeuvre that are challenging for more rigid and hierarchical command structures. Such concepts could prove to be the bane of technologically sophisticated but organisationally rigid opponents. HMC and HMT also promise to deliver the redundancy that Western force structures have lacked since the end of the Cold War, but require in order to succeed in future conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integration of HMC and HMT into force design will, however, be predicated on several structural and cultural changes within defence. In particular, altering procurement priorities to emphasise expendable capabilities and improvements in software (rather than in hardware) will require levels of risk tolerance that challenge deeply ingrained organisational qualities and processes. In addition, the cultivation of human capital will remain an enduring concern that will be as important as procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approaches that militaries and defence bureaucracies take will be contextual. There is no “one size fits all” solution. As illustrated in this policy guide, the leadership styles and levels of risk tolerance needed will depend on factors such as the immediacy with which a given capability must be fielded, the opportunity costs of delivering it, and institutional flexibility. In some cases, the benefits of better resourcing existing capabilities may outweigh those gained from using HMC and HMT. In other contexts, the imperative to use HMC and HMT will be overriding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of conflict is punctuated with moments of disruptive change that fundamentally alter the character of warfare. The confluence of unprecedented volumes of data made available and usable by AI, the growing ubiquity of automation, and the emergence of new modes of producing physical capabilities could mean that we are on the cusp of such a moment. Those states and organisations that have benefited most from periods of change were institutionally capable of comprehending the ways in which they could leverage new capabilities and integrate them at scale. Since transformation requires the state as a whole to play a role, the requirements to achieve it must be understood beyond the uniformed military. This policy guide serves as a framework that outlines both the opportunities provided by HMC and HMT and the approaches that can facilitate adoption. Though it makes no specific claims regarding large programmatic decisions, it strives to offer a basis on which such decisions might be made in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（17日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第11日審訊。已認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。張於1991年加入《壹週刊》，並於1994年升任為總編輯，其後於2005年離開壹傳媒集團。5年後，張接受黎的邀請重新入職，並於2016年升任為《蘋果日報》社長。張形容黎是集團的「最高領導人」及「最終決策人」，被問到何謂「黎智英的編採指示」，張指黎的形象「一直以來都好鮮明」，即追求「民主、自由、反極權」，特別是2019年反修例事件開始，黎認為要透過《蘋果日報》呼籲市民上街、示威及抗爭，並在國際層面上希望獲得西方民主國家的關注，「希望佢哋能夠提供援助，甚至一啲強烈啲嘅行動，好似制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;前蘋果日報社長張劍虹循職員通道出庭&quot;&gt;前蘋果日報社長張劍虹循職員通道出庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方傳召首名證人、前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹出庭作供。張於2022年5月承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」罪，現正還柙候判。他身穿黑色西裝褸、深藍色格仔恤衫，透過法官席旁邊的職員通道進入法庭，由三名懲教人員的帶領下步行至證人台就坐。張手持聖經，以基督教儀式宣誓，其後開始以廣東話作供，一名法庭傳譯員坐在其身旁把供詞翻譯成英語。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹於1991年加入壹週刊-1994年升任總編輯&quot;&gt;張劍虹於1991年加入壹週刊 1994年升任總編輯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方主問下，張確認他畢業於香港中文大學社會科學及新聞學學士學位課程。他於2021年6月17日被警方以「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」罪名拘捕，之後被正式起訴該罪及煽動刊物罪，同案被告包括黎智英、陳沛敏、羅偉光、林文宗、馮偉光、楊清奇及3間蘋果公司。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張確認自己於2021年6月17日被捕，而控罪則提及他直至2021年6月24日仍參與本案的串謀，法官李運騰關注到，這是否指稱張在還柙的數天期間仍然有參與串謀。李官認為情況並不尋常，並要求控方澄清。周天行表示稍後會向張問及此事並澄清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方提問下，張先交代他在壹傳媒集團的工作經驗。他憶述於1991年加入《壹週刊》，當時任職財經組編輯。1994年，他獲黎智英委任為《壹週刊》總編輯：「因為黎生對我工作表現滿意。」張提到，雖然當時《壹週刊》社長是楊懷康，但是黎智英每日都會在辦公室工作，參與雜誌的事務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張解釋，他加入《壹週刊》時候，公司業務只有一本雜誌，後來發展出愈來愈多雜誌，包括《一本便利》。及後1995年，黎智英創立《蘋果日報》，並於1999年上市，就在那時形成了一個壹傳媒集團。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹於2005年離職-5年後黎智英邀請下重新入職&quot;&gt;張劍虹於2005年離職 5年後黎智英邀請下重新入職&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續稱，在2000年左右，黎智英決定在台灣創辦《壹週刊》，於是委派張赴台灣協助創辦雜誌。張稱在2001至2005年間，他是台灣《壹週刊》的社長，並與黎緊密合作，故有很長時間留在台灣工作，平均每週有約3日身處台灣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;直到2005年4月，張有見台灣《壹週刊》業務已上軌道，加上開始有盈餘，所以他決定離開壹傳媒集團，「因為想趁呢個機會休息吓。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2010年，在黎智英的邀請下，張劍虹重新加入壹傳媒集團，任職內容顧問。約於2011年4月，黎將他調職往《蘋果日報》，擔任總編輯。在2011年4至12月期間，張根據本地報刊條例登記為《蘋果日報》的註冊編輯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2016年張升任蘋果日報社長-相信因獲黎欣賞工作能力&quot;&gt;2016年張升任蘋果日報社長 相信因獲黎欣賞工作能力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱他於2014年12月起擔任《蘋果日報》副社長一段時間。至2016年左右，他獲黎智英升任為社長。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到張知不知道為何黎決定將他升職。法官李運騰一度打斷，質疑此問題與案件無關，控方則稱可以顯示黎與張之間的關係。張遂回答，相信是因為黎欣賞他的工作能力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續稱，他作為《蘋果日報》的社長，會負責整個《蘋果日報》的營運和確保報紙每日出版。被問到社長與總編輯之間在職務上的分別，張解釋總編輯負責每日登報文章的審批及決策，而決策包括新聞選材、角度及決定哪一宗新聞做頭條；而社長則負責較高層面的監督工作，包括確保報紙的出版及運作，以及確保編採方針符合黎智英的政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2017年，張獲黎委任為壹傳媒有限公司，即整個壹傳媒集團的副行政總裁。2018年2月，張繼而獲委任為集團的行政總裁、執行董事，以及集團旗下公司的董事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹指黎智英為壹傳媒的最高領導人及最終決策人&quot;&gt;張劍虹指黎智英為壹傳媒的「最高領導人」及「最終決策人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向張展示壹傳媒集團的2019至2020年度的年報，封面寫有「Witness History」字眼，年報內容包括主席黎智英的話、公司的業務分佈、香港及台灣《蘋果日報》的出版業務等。控方續展示列出董事局成員的頁面，張確認直至2020年3月31日，董事局共有7名成員，包括2名執行董事、2名非執行董事，以及3名獨立非執行董事。直至同年5月25日，董事局成員的組合有變，改為3名執行董事、1名非執行董事，以及3名獨立非執行董事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;年報中列出黎智英為主席，張劍虹則為行政總裁。張確認黎於2018至2020年均任主席。控方問及兩人的職務有何分別，張表示：「黎生作為主席，係成個集團嘅最高領導人同最終決策人」，「我自己作為行政總裁，負責執行黎生同董事局嘅指示。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指3名非執行董事包括華爾街日報前社長南華早報前總編輯&quot;&gt;張指3名非執行董事包括《華爾街日報》前社長、《南華早報》前總編輯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續解釋該3名執行董事，分別為黎智英、他自己以及周達權。他指周為財政營運總裁，負責的範疇包括行政、公司秘書、廣告以及管理印刷廠。至於1名非執行董事為葉一堅，他為台灣《蘋果日報》的顧問，亦負責監督董事會。另外，3名獨立非執行董事分別為：《華爾街日報》前社長 Louis Gordon Crovitz、《南華早報》前總編輯 Mark Lambert Clifford，及專業會計師 Lam Chung Yan, Eric。3人均負責監察董事局的運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指黎智英曾任非執行董事-期間仍積極參與集團決策及運作&quot;&gt;張指黎智英曾任非執行董事 期間仍積極參與集團決策及運作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張確認黎智英於2018年2月至2020年5月25日期間，為集團的非執行董事；但於2020年5月25日後，他恢復為執行董事。控方追問原因，張表示不清楚記得原因，但補充指：「不過我自己覺得，雖然佢自2018年2月到2020年月係非執行董事，但係佢都好積極參與成個集團嘅決策同運作。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張表示副社長陳沛敏負責每天揀選蘋果日報頭版新聞&quot;&gt;張表示副社長陳沛敏負責每天揀選《蘋果日報》頭版新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後問及壹傳媒集團的高層，張表示陳沛敏於2019年4月至2021年6月為副社長，主要職責是負責《蘋果日報》紙媒的決策，以及每日揀選《蘋果日報》的頭版新聞、港聞各版的頭條，同時亦負責審批各部門的開支。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張表示總編輯羅偉光負責網站新聞管理編採部同事&quot;&gt;張表示總編輯羅偉光負責網站新聞、管理編採部同事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，羅偉光則任總編輯，主要負責《蘋果日報》網站的中文新聞出版，以及管理港聞版編採部同事。張表示理論上羅應該同時紙媒稿件的審批工作，但由於2019至2021年公司集中於網上新聞，而網上新聞需要24小時運作，因此張把紙媒工作交由陳沛敏負責。張表示陳的職位較羅高。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於執行總編輯林文宗則為陳沛敏的助手，於陳休假時會協助處理審批紙媒的職務，包括跟進執行編採會議中陳給予員工的指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一執行總編輯馮偉光，自2020年6月起負責《蘋果日報》的網上英文版，並會在每天的紙媒或網上稿件中，選取某些翻譯成英文。他亦負責管理外判翻譯團隊，並聯繫專門為英文版寫稿的寫手。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》執行總編輯 馮偉光&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指黎智英會透過-mark-simon-等介紹英文版寫手&quot;&gt;張指黎智英會透過 Mark Simon 等介紹英文版寫手&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，馮需否向任何人索取指示，張表示馮會自行決定揀選甚麼稿件翻譯，有需要時馮會問他。他補充，雖然架構上馮應該向羅偉光負責，「但係多數有關於呢樣嘢，佢都會搵我嘅。」控方追問馮需否向其他人索取指示；張解釋黎智英原本已經好清楚指示英文版的編採運作，黎亦會透過 Mark Simon 及 Mark Clifford 介紹寫手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，馮亦以筆名「盧峯」在專欄「蘋論」撰寫政治評論，他尚未負責英文版職務時，每周會撰寫兩篇社評，但於擔任上述職位後，黎智英認為他應該減少寫社評，於是改為每周一篇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於張志偉則為蘋果動新聞平台總監，負責動新聞製作，以及網上非新聞類的內容，包括娛樂、副刊、馬經及波經。他同時負責《蘋果》旗下的社交媒體帳戶，包括 Facebook、Instagram、Twitter、YouTube、PSCP.TV，以及網上直播。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又指，楊清奇為《蘋果日報》主筆，會以筆名「李平」撰寫社評，同時負責管理紙媒及網上的評論文章，需要審批稿件及聯絡作者，邀請對方寫稿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指楊清奇按黎的編採指示審批文章-形容黎追求民主自由反極權&quot;&gt;張指楊清奇按黎的編採指示審批文章 形容黎追求民主自由反極權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問張是否知道楊審批的準則，張表示楊會「按住黎智英定下嘅編採同評論政策」，即其編採指示審批文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到何謂「黎智英的編採指示」，張回答指黎的形象「一直以來都好鮮明」，即追求「民主、自由，同埋反極權」，特別是2019年反修例事件開始，黎智英認為政府對香港的民主自由存在打壓，並認為要透過《蘋果日報》去呼籲市民上街、示威及抗爭，以向政府施壓。此外，在國際層面上，黎希望獲得西方民主國家的關注，「希望佢哋能夠提供援助，甚至一啲強烈啲嘅行動，好似制裁。」張又指，上述《蘋果日報》高層的職位均由黎指派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告黎智英（76歲）否認一項「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」及兩項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李運騰和李素蘭審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英的律師團隊包括資深大律師彭耀鴻和大律師 Marc Corlett、關文渭、黃雅斌、董皓哲及李峰琦。3間蘋果日報公司清盤人由大律師王國豪代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方由副刑事檢控專員周天行、署理助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤、高級檢控官吳加悅及陳穎琛等代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同案8名被告：前行政總裁張劍虹、前總編輯羅偉光、前副社長陳沛敏、前執行總編輯林文宗、前英文主筆馮偉光、前主筆楊清奇、李宇軒和陳梓華，早前已承認「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，現正還柙，等待黎智英審訊完畢後判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（17日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第11日審訊。控方傳召認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。張提到，黎智英透過每週召開的「飯盒會」，向《蘋果》高層下達編採方面的指示。他指由《蘋果》創刊至2014年佔中之前，《蘋果》基本上予人印象是「狗仔隊、娛樂」，後來黎投入參與佔中，自此積極制訂編採政策，因而成為了《蘋果》的分水嶺，「好似成為一間反政府、對抗中央嘅一個報紙。」2019年政府提出修訂《逃犯條例》，黎亦曾向管理層稱修例侵犯香港人的民主自由和人權，並擔心倘通過修例「傳媒都冇得做」，所以認為要透過《蘋果》呼籲市民上街抗爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹午休後簡述蘋果日常運作-列出各種會議&quot;&gt;張劍虹午休後簡述蘋果日常運作 列出各種會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今早開始傳召首名證人、已認罪的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹出庭作供，他上午交代其在壹傳媒集團的工作經驗，下午則開始談及《蘋果日報》的日常運作。張作供期間，被告欄內的黎智英不時手執原子筆和記事本抄寫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹供稱，營辦一份報紙牽涉很多新聞材料，要在當中揀選角度及決定「做幾大」，乃涉及整個《蘋果日報》的編採政策，所以他們的日常運作過程中，每天都需要召開不同會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指每日下午2時半有一個「鋤報會」，出席的同事包括陳沛敏、羅偉光、林文宗，以及各部門主管，會議目的是檢討當天已出版的實體報紙，審視內容、標題有何不足及需要改進的地方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，每日下午3時則有一個「初會」，出席的人包括陳沛敏、林文宗、羅偉光，亦有不同部門的主管，包括突發新聞、港聞、國際、兩岸、法庭及財經等。會議由陳沛敏主持，各部門主管會匯報當天有哪些新聞發生，而陳則會從中揀選一些新聞，指示同事如何繼續跟進及「做詳細啲、豐富啲」。張又指，上述牽涉《蘋果日報》的編採政策，由管理層按照黎智英的指示而訂立。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》執行總編輯 林文宗（左）、前《蘋果日報》副社長 陳沛敏（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，每日下午大概5時至5時半有一個「編前會」，主要決定翌日出版的實體報紙頭版，以及港聞版每頁的頭條。出席者包括陳沛敏和林文宗，但張不肯定羅偉光是否出席者之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指，《蘋果日報》逢周二都會舉辦一次「Planning 會」，出席者包括陳沛敏、林文宗、羅偉光及各部門主管，由陳主持會議。各部門主管會報告手上有什麼新聞材料及正在跟進什麼專題，而陳、林和羅會向一眾部門主管下達黎智英的指示，包括有哪些「故仔」可以跟進、吩咐他們如何準備。此外，《蘋果》主筆楊清奇會報告星期六的論壇版會有什麼專題，同樣是按照黎的立場而定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張表示，他通常不會出席上述會議，而據他所知，黎智英亦沒有出席這些會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹稱黎智英透過飯盒會下達編採指示&quot;&gt;張劍虹稱黎智英透過「飯盒會」下達編採指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黎智英如何下達編採方面的指示，張劍虹指會透過召開「飯盒會」。每逢星期四，黎會輪流與《蘋果日報》、《壹週刊》、《飲食男女》、廣告部等舉行「飯盒會」，例如今個星期與《蘋果日報》團隊開會，下周便會與《壹週刊》團隊開會，接著下周則是《飲食男女》團隊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就《蘋果日報》的「飯盒會」，張指由黎主持，其他出席者包括他自己、壹傳媒集團財務總裁周達權、資訊科技部主管Connie Chan、陳沛敏、羅偉光、林文宗，以及陳邀請的部門主管，每次與會者人數有10至15人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指，由於「飯盒會」逢星期四舉行，所以早於星期一或二，有意出席的同事會加入黎智英設立的聊天群組，若有任何想法或問題可在群組內提出，屆時黎會在「飯盒會」中現身解答。張指會議之前，眾人會在壹傳媒大樓的飯堂買飯盒，然後於下午12時半前往5樓的貴賓房，一邊吃飯盒一邊參與會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，黎在會議期間會談及對時局的看法、其政治取態，以及在當時形勢底下《蘋果日報》的編採政策，讓與會人士再下達給沒有出席會議的管理層，之後各人會各司其職。張稱黎指示他做會議記錄，另會吩咐他跟進某些工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，黎不只參與會議，更是制訂編採政策的角色，問張是否正確。張確認，因黎是《蘋果日報》的創辦人，也是最大股東，持有超過70%股權。張亦形容黎是《蘋果日報》的「舵手」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹2014年黎智英投入佔中運動-蘋果成反政府報紙&quot;&gt;張劍虹：2014年黎智英投入佔中運動 《蘋果》成反政府報紙&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹表示，他記得由《蘋果日報》創刊至2014年佔中運動之前，黎智英比較少參與《蘋果》的編採工作。「當時基本上好多人都認為《蘋果日報》嘅形象都係狗仔隊、娛樂」，直至2014年佔中前後，「黎生就好積極咁制訂《蘋果日報》的編採政策。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，黎當時要求用《蘋果日報》去呼籲市民爭取民主、上街抗爭，「嗰時我好記得，要推動6.22公投，啫係爭取『我要真普選』，反對白皮書吖。」（註：2014年國務院發表的《一國兩制在香港的實踐》白皮書）張提到當時有一首歌曲改編自電影《孤星淚》歌曲，《蘋果》曾找人演唱，黎亦獻唱了一、兩句。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;後來2014年9月佔中爆發，張形容「黎生亦都好投入呢個佔中運動」，「我覺得呢件事係一個分水嶺，《蘋果日報》呢就好似成為一間反政府、對抗中央嘅一個報紙。」張指「由嗰時開始《蘋果日報》就行緊呢條路」，管理層亦跟從黎智英這個方向去經營這份報紙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英憂倘通過修例-傳媒都冇得做-冀透過蘋果籲上街&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英憂倘通過修例 「傳媒都冇得做」 冀透過《蘋果》籲上街&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行提及2019年的香港社會騷亂，問張事件有否影響《蘋果》的編採方向。張表示有影響，當政府宣布修訂《逃犯條例》後，黎智英會向高層說「《逃犯條例》啫係侵犯香港人嘅民主自由，同埋香港人嘅人權」，並認為「中共要透過呢個條例，將唔聽話嘅人，同中共政權嘅眼中釘送返大陸」。黎又提到「商界都好擔心」，並指若然修例通過，「傳媒都冇得做」，「所以黎生認為要透過《蘋果日報》叫啲人上街、抗爭。」在國際層面，黎亦認為要透過《蘋果》呼籲西方民主國家關注修例事件，希望他們出手對抗中央，甚至制裁香港官員，務求「等佢哋唔敢亂嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張補充，黎於2019年3至4月期間，除了在「飯盒會」談及過上述言論，亦曾在張的辦公室房間內說過相同言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹蘋論作者須經黎智英批准才能聘用&quot;&gt;張劍虹：「蘋論」作者須經黎智英批准才能聘用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於評論文章，張劍虹指黎智英同樣有下達指示，因新聞報導和評論的方針均是一致。張指《蘋果》社論一定要根據黎訂立的方向去撰寫，而刊於評論版的文章則由楊清奇負責審批。楊亦是按照黎的編採方向批核稿件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「社論」和「評論版」之間的分別，張指社論即是「蘋論」，每日均在一個專欄刊出，共有4名寫手，分別為馮偉光（筆名盧峯）、楊清奇（筆名李平）、方圓和古立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張提到，黎智英會就社論寫手人選給予建議，並會把一些寫得好及符合其方向的作者介紹給楊清奇。其中方圓乃由黎介紹，因他的文章多是批評政府和「反共」，黎認為方圓對中國共產黨熟悉，所以文章寫得好。由於社論作者必須經黎的批准才能聘用，所以從未試過社論作者不符合黎的指示的情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而評論版則由不同的作者撰寫文章，內容比較多元化，不過「評論版」與「蘋論」一樣均刊載於「A疊（港聞版）」。楊清奇負責審批文章，當中部份作者由楊邀約，有的則由黎介紹，張自己也會不時介紹適合人選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱，他在2020年曾向楊清奇建議邀約一名日本人撰寫評論文章，惟一時記不起該日本人的名字。由於該日本人曾經訪問過黎智英，二人互相認識，他的文章亦有批評政府和談及日本的政治鬥爭，所以張認為他適合在供稿予《蘋果》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英專欄文章-冇人敢修改&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英專欄文章 「冇人敢修改」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黎智英的專欄「成敗樂一笑」，張指它每逢星期日出版，但不是刊登於港聞的評論版，而是刊登於副刊的專欄版。他形容黎的文章「一般都係反共同批評政府」，但因為楊清奇不需負責審批副刊的專欄文章，所以不需要處理黎的專欄文章，除非黎要求其文章刊登於港聞的評論版，但這情況只發生過一、兩次。張又補充：「可以咁講，黎生嘅文係冇人敢修改。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gfsn9Fk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（16日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第10日審訊。辯方反對控方專家、香港城市大學法律學院教授王貴國的兩份專家報告呈堂，因認為與本案控罪元素無關。3名《國安法》指定法官考慮控辯雙方陳詞後，認為王貴國的證供有助法庭了解美國針對中港官員而實施的措施，以及提供足夠資訊予法庭判斷相關措施是否能夠構成「制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為」，最終批准兩份專家報告呈堂。控方表示，明天將會傳召首名證人，預料主問需時一星期。據悉首名證人為前蘋果日報社長張劍虹。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方反對專家報告呈堂-稱黎涉案行為與外國措施沒有因果關係&quot;&gt;辯方反對專家報告呈堂 稱黎涉案行為與外國措施沒有因果關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方擬引用香港城市大學法律學院教授王貴國分別於2022年11月17日及2023年11月15日撰寫的兩份報告，以圖列出美國針對中港官員而實施的制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為，以及解釋相關措施的法律效力，包括影響、後果和時效。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方代表、大律師關文渭則反對報告呈堂，並指它對於本案沒有足夠關聯，因黎智英的涉案行為與報告提及的外國措施之間並沒有因果關係，例如《香港人權及民主法案》於2019年下半年立法，比兩項串謀勾結外國勢力控罪時段更加早。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 辯方大律師 關文渭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰則認為，當外國政府聲稱會實施制裁，並不代表相關措施構成「制裁」，法庭需要王貴國的專家證供，去判斷外國採取或立法的措施是否構成「制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為」。李官澄清，王貴國的報告並未有評論黎智英的言論或請求，因此與黎的犯案意圖無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;報告提及外國措施立法過程-辯方質疑轉移焦點&quot;&gt;報告提及外國措施立法過程 辯方質疑轉移焦點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭續指，王貴國提交的補充報告提及《香港人權及民主法案》影響香港的利益，他質疑這部份何以與措施是否「制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為」有關係。關又指，報告闡述外國措施的立法過程和背景，可是既然外國立法並不是因為黎智英的言行所致，這些資料僅轉移焦點（red herring），並不能協助法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰則指，專家報告是否能協助到法庭，最終可交由法庭決定。法官李運騰則指，法庭需要一名專家的協助，以了解這些外國措施的法律效力和後續影響，否則難以知道它們是否構成「制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為」。關文渭則指這與控罪元素無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行則表示，他們並非依賴王貴國的證供去證明黎的行為導致外國採取制裁措施。但控方指相關因果關係乃依賴「共犯證人」的庭上證供。控方重申王貴國的專家報告能夠協助法庭理解外國的措施是否構成「制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官批准王貴國專家報告呈堂&quot;&gt;官批准王貴國專家報告呈堂&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;經休庭約一小時考慮，由法官李運騰讀出裁決，他指王貴國的專家報告與本案相關，批准呈堂。控辯雙方均不爭議王貴國是一名美國法律專家，至於報告提及美國以外的其他國家，控方則不會依賴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，兩項串謀勾結外國勢力控罪均是「串謀」請求外國實施制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為，而控方並不需要證明外國實際上有實施相關措施。若然真的有任何外國措施擬訂立或實行，那只是環境證據，協助控方證明涉案「串謀」存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指專家證供的作用在於告知法庭外國法律的內容，以及在有需要時解釋外國法院如何解讀相關法律，因此法官接納控方所指，外國法律的事實部份有待專家證供證明。法官認為王貴國的證供有助法庭了解美國針對中港官員而實施的措施，以及提供足夠資訊予法庭判斷相關措施是否能夠構成「制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又提到，現階段只需處理專家報告是否可以呈堂，而不需處理證據比重，至於法庭最終是否接納王貴國的證供則有待決定。假如法庭最終認為王的證供無助他們判斷，他們便不會予以考慮。基於以上，3名法官批准王的專家報告呈堂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李運騰和李素蘭審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英的律師團隊包括資深大律師彭耀鴻和大律師 Marc Corlett、關文渭、黃雅斌、董皓哲及李峰琦。3間蘋果日報公司清盤人由大律師王國豪代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方由副刑事檢控專員周天行、署理助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤、高級檢控官吳加悅及陳穎琛等代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同案8名被告：前行政總裁張劍虹、前總編輯羅偉光、前副社長陳沛敏、前執行總編輯林文宗、前英文主筆馮偉光、前主筆楊清奇、李宇軒和陳梓華，早前已承認「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，現正還柙，等待黎智英審訊完畢後判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，於2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀，請求外國或者境外機構、組織、人員實施對香港特別行政區或者中華人民共和國進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，指黎智英於2020年7月1日至今年2月15日間，與Mark Simon、陳梓華、李宇軒、劉祖廸及其他人串謀，請求外國或境外機構、組織、人員，實施對中國或香港進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司於2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及/或複製煽動刊物，具意圖：&lt;/p&gt;

Based on interviews with ransomware victims and incident responders, this paper outlines the harms to organisations, individuals, the UK economy, national security and wider society.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research reveals a wide range of harms caused by ransomware, including physical, financial, reputational, psychological and social harms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set out a framework of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First-order harms:&lt;/strong&gt; Harms to any organisation and their staff directly targeted by a ransomware operation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second-order harms:&lt;/strong&gt; Harms to any organisation or individuals that are indirectly affected by a ransomware incident.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third-order harms:&lt;/strong&gt; The cumulative effect of ransomware incidents on wider society, the economy and national security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on an existing taxonomy of cyber harms, this framework will enable policymakers, practitioners and researchers to categorise more case studies on ransomware incidents and to better explain new and existing types of harm to the UK and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware is a risk for organisations of all sizes. The findings from this paper highlight that ransomware can create significant financial costs and losses for organisations, which in some cases can threaten their very existence. Ransomware can also create reputational harm for businesses that rely on continuous operations or hold very sensitive data – although customers and the general public can be more forgiving than some victims believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The harms from ransomware go beyond financial and reputational costs for organisations. Interviews with victims and incident responders revealed that ransomware creates physical and psychological harms for individuals and groups, including members of staff, healthcare patients and schoolchildren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware can ruin lives. Incidents highlighted in this paper have caused individuals to lose their jobs, evoked feelings of shame and self-blame, extended to private and family life, and contributed to serious health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The harm and cumulative effects caused by ransomware attacks have implications for wider society and national security, including supply chain disruption, a loss of trust in law enforcement, reduced faith in public services, and the normalisation of cybercrime. Ransomware also creates a strategic advantage for the hostile states harbouring the cyber-criminals who conduct such operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downstream harm to individuals from ransomware is more severe when attacks encrypt IT infrastructure, rather than steal and leak data. There is no evidence from this research that the ransomware ecosystem is exploiting stolen or leaked personal data in a systemic way for fraud or other financially motivated cybercrimes. At present, exploiting stolen data for other activities is less profitable than extortion-based crime that takes away victims’ access to their systems and data. This finding may inform victim decision-making on when they should and should not consider paying a ransom demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) recently assessed that ransomware remains one of the most acute cyber threats facing the UK. In 2023 alone, companies and public bodies affected by ransomware incidents in the UK included the Royal Mail, outsourcing firm Capita and an NHS trust. In late May 2023, one cybercrime group exploited a critical software flaw within a file transfer platform (MOVEit), reportedly impacting over 60 million individuals and more than 2,600 organisations worldwide. In the UK context, this incident enabled attackers to compromise a third-party HR company, likely exposing employees’ personal data – including company IDs and national insurance numbers from organisations such as British Airways, Boots and the BBC – to organised cyber-criminals. This may have been the largest ransomware incident of 2023, with a Russian-based threat actor linked to the CL0P ransomware operation claiming responsibility and demanding ransom payments in exchange for deleting the data. It demonstrated ransomware threat actors’ ability to continue to evolve their tactics and scale their operations to affect multiple victims in one operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat from ransomware shows no signs of abating, thanks to its profitable and innovative business model, poor cyber security practices in many organisations, and a permissive law enforcement environment in Russia. No sector is off limits as threat actors continue to target public and private sector organisations, schools, hospitals and local government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the victims of these attacks rarely share their experiences. There are many reasons for this reticence, including legal reasons, reputational concerns, or even plain fear – ransomware groups use aggressive language and methods to increase the victims’ propensity to pay a ransom. Consequently, the lack of reporting to law enforcement and cyber security agencies, and limited transparency on the part of victims (including in terms of communicating with the media) means that there is scant understanding of the range of harms experienced by victims during and after such incidents. This research paper addresses that gap, by speaking to victims or others associated with an incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By shining a light on the harms experienced by victims, this research provides a clearer picture of the harm caused by ransomware and therefore also the economic, societal and national security risks posed by ransomware groups to the UK and beyond. This is important for policymakers and industry, as a more holistic understanding of the harms stemming from ransomware will allow government to make more informed policy prioritisation choices so as to reduce the threat and help law enforcement, incident responders and organisations to better support victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, much of the coverage of ransomware focuses on the financial harm inflicted by ransomware incidents. This is understandable, as financial harm is a highly relevant impact that is both tangible and, at times, measurable. For example, media coverage often addresses the immediate financial impact of ransomware in the form of ransom payments and business continuity costs. Similarly, several studies focus on the cost of data breaches or other cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks. This paper does not seek to play down financial harm – indeed, ransomware causes wider financial harm than is usually recognised, but there are few studies that attempt to make a macroeconomic impact assessment of the harm from ransomware beyond the cost to a particular organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are a range of other harms from ransomware too, beyond the obvious financial impacts. These harms go beyond just affecting the direct victim of an incident – indirect victims can include other organisations, communities and individuals – and can be physical and psychological in nature. There is a real human impact to ransomware attacks that is yet to be fully grasped and measured. Although some reporting has tried to focus on this aspect by exploring the impact of incidents on students and council tenants, or by exploring the psychological and long-term harms caused by ransomware, such reports remain few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware can ruin lives. This paper addresses the broader harms caused by ransomware, ranging from individual victims through to UK national security and prosperity. By engaging with victims and those associated with an incident, such as incident responders, insurers, lawyers, law enforcement officers and government officials, this research uncovers unique insights into a range of harms from ransomware. The findings should not only alert more policymakers to the scourge of ransomware, but also lead to a serious rethink about the resources required to combat ransomware in a meaningful way, both in the UK context and more widely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper comprises three chapters. Chapter I sets outs out the tactics and techniques used by ransomware threat actors to cause harm. Chapter II details the harms that result from ransomware attacks, in an analysis based on interview data, workshops and public reporting; impacts from ransomware incidents are listed as first-, second- and/or third-order harms respectively. Chapter III sets out important implications for policymakers and practitioners to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is part of a 12-month research project on “Ransomware Harms and the Victim Experience”. The project is funded by the UK’s NCSC and the Research Institute in Sociotechnical Cyber Security, and conducted by RUSI and the University of Kent. The paper’s aim is to understand the wide range of harms caused by ransomware attacks to individuals, organisations and society at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper focuses on the question of what harms (for example, physical, economic, societal, psychological) ransomware incidents cause to organisations and individuals in the UK, and to the UK more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data collection and analysis for this paper entailed a literature review, semi-structured interviews and workshops. One strength of the research approach is that participants were encouraged to speak freely about their own experience of ransomware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Literature review&lt;/strong&gt;: This consisted of a literature review of publicly available sources on ransomware harm and ransomware victims. It included a non-systematic review of publicly available academic and grey literature, including surveys and reports conducted by stakeholders in the ransomware ecosystem. The initial literature review was conducted in August and September 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semi-structured interviews:&lt;/strong&gt; The primary dataset for the paper is based on 42 semi-structured interviews with victims of ransomware attacks and with subject matter experts from across the ransomware ecosystem, including individuals from the insurance industry, government and law enforcement, as well as incident responders. Interviews were conducted between November 2022 and March 2023, and were anonymised to allow individuals to speak openly about potentially sensitive issues. The research team then analysed the interview transcripts using NVivo data analysis software. Throughout this paper, an anonymised coding system, based on Table 1, is used to refer to interview data in the footnotes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workshops:&lt;/strong&gt; In November 2022 and February 2023, the research team conducted two online workshops with key stakeholders from UK government, the insurance and cyber security industries, lawyers and law enforcement. Attendees included a mix of interviewees and new participants, using contacts established during the interview phase. The first workshop was used for data gathering and had 26 participants; the second was used to validate and reassess themes identified in the first workshop, the literature review and in interviews, and had 21 participants.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper focuses primarily on the harm caused in a UK context, but it also draws on experiences from other countries, such as the US. A small number of international participants were included in this research project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0gGBDm5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Interview Participants (Non-Victims/Victims).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;definitions&quot;&gt;Definitions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of this paper, a “victim” is any person or organisation that experiences harm as a result of a ransomware attack. This term can apply to individuals and organisations that are directly impacted, and to those that are indirectly affected and experience harm as a result. The term “harm” refers to any negative impact the victim may experience, which could be of a financial, physical, psychological, reputational or other nature. These underlying definitions are intentionally broad, allowing this paper to examine the full range of harms and victims that are impacted by ransomware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of factors limit the generalisability of the research’s findings. First, the victim interviews should not be considered representative of a “universal” victim experience. As identified in the research, there is variation in the harms experienced by different victims. Additionally, the interviews included more public sector than private sector victims, with a very limited number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represented. Moreover, there may also be a self-reporting bias, given that the interview data is based on organisations that were happy to speak about the harm they experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the observations made in this paper are primarily about the UK. While many businesses – victims and those that are part of the cyber security ecosystem alike – provide services globally, the focus of this research rested on incidents and victims in the UK and their interactions with the UK cyber security ecosystem, including UK law enforcement and government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-ransomware-tactics-and-targeting&quot;&gt;I. Ransomware: Tactics and Targeting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware has historically been defined as a form of malware that disrupts a user’s access to their computer system through encryption or locking. However, in recent years “ransomware” has become a catch-all term for different types of cyber extortion – including data theft. As such, this paper follows the Ransomware Task Force’s broader definition of ransomware as activity where threat actors compromise computer systems and demand a ransom for the restoration or non-exposure of encrypted and/or stolen data and systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;creators-of-harm-the-ransomware-ecosystem&quot;&gt;Creators of Harm: The Ransomware Ecosystem&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware, after nearly a decade of growth and innovation, is a highly profitable criminal enterprise supported by a diverse and professionalised ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is no fixed business model for ransomware threat actors, a recent joint report by the UK’s NCSC and the National Crime Agency (NCA) outlined three broad business models that all cause harm to UK victims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “buy-a-build” model, which usually involves smaller groups of less experienced cyber-criminals obtaining existing ransomware code to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “in-house” model, where the same organisation responsible for developing the ransomware also conduct the operations (although they may still rely on other parts of the cyber-criminal ecosystem for other services necessary to monetise ransomware).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “ransomware-as-a-service” (RaaS) model, which involves collaboration between groups/individuals who develop and maintain the infrastructure and tools behind ransomware operations, and “affiliates” who conduct operations for a percentage of profits. This model has become dominant in the ransomware ecosystem and has enabled operators to scale and increase the volume of attacks, thereby increasing the amount of harm ransomware causes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware operations are also supported by specialists in the criminal ecosystem, such as botnet operators, initial access brokers (who specialise in gaining access to victims’ networks), negotiators and money launderers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methods-of-harm-extortion-tactics-and-techniques&quot;&gt;Methods of Harm: Extortion Tactics and Techniques&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware criminals are profit-driven and have developed a range of tactics and techniques to extort payments from victims. These methods rest on causing harm (or the fear of potential harm) to victims to pressure them into ceding to threat actors’ demands. Cyber-criminals use two primary extortion methods, although these are supported by a range of additional extortion tactics and techniques to increase their leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Primary Extortion Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encryption:&lt;/strong&gt; Encrypting data is the most common tactic used by ransomware threat actors. This approach involves gaining access to a victim’s network, escalating privileges and accessing as many systems as possible before deploying malware that encrypts files and delivers the ransom note. Although early “pray-and-spray” ransomware campaigns only targeted individual endpoints, ransomware affiliates now aim to compromise domain administrator accounts so as to encrypt thousands of computers within a single organisation in one go. To maximise disruption and harm, threat actors will often spend time seeking out the critical systems and backups before encrypting them. These attacks can be particularly harmful to organisations that rely on maintaining continuous operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data theft:&lt;/strong&gt; Since late 2019, cyber-criminals have also adopted so-called “double extortion” tactics, stealing victims’ data as well as encrypting it, then threatening to leak it unless the ransom is paid. Data theft can be a particularly useful tactic for targeting organisations with sensitive intellectual property, safeguarding data (such as schools) or medical data. Stolen financial information, including accounting and insurance policies, can be used to help threat actors design negotiation strategies and set ransom demands. Recently, some ransomware operations have foregone encrypting victims’ data altogether, and just stolen it. This trend is in part driven by larger organisations’ efforts to improve their resilience against ransomware by introducing offline backups and other measures, but also by the emergence in 2022 and 2023 of ransomware operations that exploit vulnerabilities in file transfer services, enabling criminals to steal data from dozens or even hundreds of victims at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secondary Extortion Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After encrypting systems and/or stealing data, ransomware threat actors often use additional methods to raise the stakes for victims and disrupt their response and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data leak sites:&lt;/strong&gt; Since adopting data theft tactics, ransomware operators have also launched “name-and-shame” leak sites, on both the dark and clear webs, where they can name victims and leak data. This shames victims, but also serves as a warning to future victims who might consider refusing to pay. Threat actors can also draw additional attention to data leaks through social media or by contacting journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harassment of employees and customers:&lt;/strong&gt; More aggressive ransomware threat actors will also directly contact an affected organisation’s employees or customers. This method can be untargeted – for instance, cold calling a company’s phonelines in the hope that an employee will pick up; or more targeted – such as directly contacting executives or sending stolen personal data to relevant employees. This can be particularly embarrassing – and involve reputational risk and commercial consequences – if cyber-criminals send stolen data to a victim’s customers or users. Some reporting suggests that ransomware threat actors are adopting more extreme forms of harassment as victims’ willingness to pay ransoms decreases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DDoS attacks:&lt;/strong&gt; Ransomware threat actors have also been known to use distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to increase disruption to victims’ digital infrastructure. However, industry reporting indicates that this is not a widely used tactic: for instance, a report by the cyber security vendor Unit 42 (part of Palo Alto Networks), suggested that only 2% of the ransomware incidents they responded to in 2022 involved a DDoS attack as part of the extortion attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;who-experiences-harm-ransomware-targeting-and-victimisation&quot;&gt;Who Experiences Harm: Ransomware Targeting and Victimisation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware threat actors are largely agnostic about who they choose to target, which means that almost any organisation is a potential ransomware victim. However, there are several considerations that, to varying degrees, appear to influence ransomware targeting and victimisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunism:&lt;/strong&gt; Ransomware affiliates either gain access to organisations themselves or use specialist access brokers. In either case, organisations are typically compromised through opportunistic tactics and techniques that are designed to gain access to a wide range of victims through scanning for internet-facing vulnerabilities or poorly secured remote desktop protocols, or via phishing campaigns. This makes organisations and sectors that underinvest in or mismanage IT infrastructure and cyber security particularly vulnerable to ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nature of business/organisation:&lt;/strong&gt; Some ransomware threat actors appear to prioritise organisations that are incentivised to quickly resolve incidents. Criminals often seek targets for whom it is critical that their operations provide certain products or services in a timely manner. Alternatively, being attuned to the potential regulatory and reputational risks that the exposure of customer or client data can entail, they might prioritise organisations that hold sensitive information. This means that victims may be targeted by virtue of the vulnerabilities linked to their industry sector. While some ransomware actors adopt a risk-averse avoidance of critical national infrastructure (CNI) sectors (although this is unlikely to be an absolute commitment to avoid disrupting such sectors), others prioritise their targeting based on the assumption of an increased likelihood of payment. Some ransomware groups were relentless in their targeting of healthcare organisations during the Covid-19 pandemic, while one more recent ransomware operation, Vice Society, has focused on targeting and stealing sensitive data from education providers in the US and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size of organisation:&lt;/strong&gt; Some threat actors deliberately target larger organisations. So-called “big game hunting” ransomware operations aim to generate sizeable pay-outs from large corporations. However, size does not matter for most ransomware threat actors, and reporting from Coveware, a specialist ransomware response firm, consistently highlights that the median ransomware victim is a medium-sized organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these factors emphasise that a wide range of organisations (and by extension, their employees and customers, or users of their products and services) can be harmed by ransomware. The rest of this paper examines the impact of ransomware on organisations, individuals and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-ransomware-harms&quot;&gt;II. Ransomware Harms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter identifies the range of harms that organisations, individuals and countries such as the UK experience as a result of a ransomware incident. The findings build on existing research that analyses or categorises ransomware or cyber breach harms. Existing research has, for instance: drawn a distinction between “direct” and “indirect” harms to a victim (particularly financial); explored cumulative impacts, such as reduced employee productivity; emphasised the potential societal impacts arising from protracted CNI downtime; articulated the risk of tangible loss of reputation; considered psychological harms experienced by impacted individuals; and reflected on the broader range of impacts that may be experienced by clients, including hospital patients and school students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve understanding of the different types of harm caused by ransomware across society and to help understand the scale of the policy challenge, this paper uses a framework with three categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First-order harms:&lt;/strong&gt; Harms to any organisation (and its staff) directly targeted by a ransomware operation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second-order harms:&lt;/strong&gt; Harms to any organisation or individuals that are indirectly affected by a ransomware incident (e.g. organisations that are customers or clients of a victim, or individuals that are customers of a victim or use a service that is disrupted).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third-order harms:&lt;/strong&gt; The cumulative effect of incidents on wider society, the economy and national security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eUaX3wO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: The Three Different Categories of Ransomware Harms, and Who/What They Affect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 illustrates how ransomware attacks can cascade through the supply chain, economy and society, distinguishing between harms that are experienced by organisations, individuals and countries. Some harms impact the organisations directly targeted by ransomware, others impact organisations and individuals indirectly affected by ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis draws on a 2018 taxonomy of cyber harms, which identifies five broad types of harm: physical or digital; financial or economic; reputational; psychological; and social or societal. These five themes are applied to the three categories in the framework to illustrate the range of harms that organisations, individuals and countries can suffer. Each order of harm is contextualised using an author-generated figure, the content of which was derived from interviews and workshop data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, this framework is not intended to be definitive. It builds on previous research and should be added to in the future. We urge policymakers, researchers and practitioners to continue to identify new types of harms based on further case studies and personal experiences, particularly with regard to sectors not represented in our evidence base. New types of harm will no doubt emerge as ransomware operators find new ways to harm and extort their victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;first-order-harms&quot;&gt;First-Order Harms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first category involves harms to the organisations and staff directly targeted by ransomware. Interview and workshop data highlighted areas of convergence and divergence between “organisation” and “staff” harm, to the extent that it is necessary to distinguish overtly between the two. The distinction between an organisation and individuals (and the harm they experience) is less apparent for small business owners or sole traders. They typically do not distinguish between the organisation and themselves, and might not have any other employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DaqRPfT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Categorisation of First-Order Harms to Organisations and Their Staff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First-Order Harms to Organisations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the organisational level, this research has identified three main types of harm caused by ransomware: physical/digital harm to systems and data; financial harm; and reputational harm. While general reporting on ransomware harms often focuses on the immediate financial harm, for example, when media reporting stresses the size of a ransomware payment, the research data indicates that the range of harm experienced by the victim organisation is much broader. The following section identifies themes that emerged from the research data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital and Physical Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This category of harm describes negative impacts on an organisation’s digital and physical systems, and on its data. Broadly, such harm results from the effects of ransomware threat actors’ efforts to encrypt systems or steal data, and sometimes, in turn, from defenders’ efforts to contain an incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware attacks involving encryption can have a profound negative impact on an organisation’s IT infrastructure. Several of the victims interviewed revealed that their servers had been encrypted by the ransomware in their entirety, with one victim in the education sector losing access to more than 10,000 computers as a result. The impact becomes even more significant if ransomware operators are also able to encrypt or delete any backups. Interviewees also highlighted how common it is for cyber-criminals to deploy ransomware at the end of the week or during public holidays, when organisations are slower to react and defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent of disruption to IT infrastructure from ransomware varies from incident to incident. One government agency described how, in the aftermath of the ransomware deployment, “we had lost access to all of our systems and … all of our data. We were right back to being a non-digital non-IT organisation”. Indeed, a number of interviewees highlighted how, in the absence of key digital services, ransomware often forces organisations to return to operating by “pen and paper”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other cases, ransomware can be isolated to a single server or IT function, either because it fails to deploy as planned or because security controls or resilience measures are (at least partially) effective. However, even in these cases, the effort to contain ransomware can still have significant impacts on the delivery of business operations. Several interviewees highlighted how they had to disconnect or isolate their IT infrastructure from the internet for several days – or even weeks – while they assessed the extent of the attack and removed the threat actor’s access to their networks. The impact from drastic incident response measures can be as harmful to operations as the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ransomware attack and the subsequent recovery efforts can also result in prolonged reduced performance of IT infrastructure. Although some victims are able to recover within weeks or months, interviewees reported that recovery efforts can sometimes stretch into years. One interviewee from the professional services sector emphasised that their company still had trouble with impacted financial systems several years after the incident. Hackney Council, which was targeted by cyber-criminals using Pysa ransomware in October 2022, took more than two years to recover fully from the incident. And if backups are encrypted or destroyed, organisations may lose access to data permanently. One interviewee from the education sector, for instance, highlighted how teachers permanently lost teaching material following an attack against their academy trust, with some losing 20 years’ worth of resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware can also harm physical systems and processes. Although most ransomware operations lack the capability to directly compromise industrial control systems (ICS) and operational technology (OT), the disruption of IT infrastructure can cause cascading operational impacts. Indeed, the increasing convergence of IT and OT leaves physical infrastructure more vulnerable to ransomware. One notable example is the 2019 ransomware attack on Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian aluminium and hydroelectric producer, which caused several plants to shut down at great cost. A small number of the victims interviewed for this research paper used ICS as a core part of their business or operations, but most did not. Nonetheless, several interviewees highlighted examples where disruption to their IT digital infrastructure had knock-on effects on their operations. These included schools that lost access to CCTV, fire control systems, and doors and gates, and a victim in the education sector that lost control over fridges and freezers containing sensitive research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victims of ransomware attacks experience a wide range of financial harm. Some forms of financial harm – such as the cost of a ransom payment – can be measured relatively easily, with studies finding that both ransom demands and incident response costs are steadily increasing. Other aspects of financial harm are harder to quantify, such as the cost of missed opportunities and reduced productivity. This means that there is limited understanding of the long-term financial harm caused by ransomware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, interview data confirmed that, in line with wider public reporting, primary attention rests on immediate financial harm, for example in the form of the additional costs encountered from a ransom payment, or losses arising from business interruption. One notable finding is that interviewees from victim organisations frequently reported that senior leadership would make assessments of the cost of the given ransomware incident, although it was challenging to disaggregate the overall costs of the ransomware incident from other fiscal shocks that occurred in the same timeframe as the incident, such as the Covid-19 pandemic. These assessments would typically have a tightly restricted readership. The interviews also confirmed that many organisations generally have limited understanding of the overall financial impact a ransomware attack has on the organisation, particularly with respect to financial harm that is not covered by an insurance policy, or which plays out over the long term. Therefore, the data represented here is subject to the same limitations: assessments of financial impact are unlikely to be definitive, and there is a need for further research in this area. Given the scale and depth of ransomware as an impactful form of contemporary cybercrime affecting almost all organisational sectors, it is important to further collective understanding of the scale of this harm to individual organisations and the wider economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional Costs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediate financial harm spans the cost of paying the ransom itself and hiring external parties to help with the response to the incident – for example, incident response teams and lawyers, but also PR professionals. Often, the costs of hiring such third parties far exceeds the demand for the ransom payment. Some providers, such as lawyers, are costly, especially when incidents are complex. The high additional costs of hiring help from third parties are financially challenging where they are not covered by insurance, especially for small companies or for public service providers with limited financial reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional costs may also be incurred from paying existing staff overtime, or from hiring new (or temporary) staff. A victim from the education sector, for example, paid employees extra during the initial response phase, but also hired a cryptocurrency broker to facilitate access to cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But additional costs can also occur in less expected ways: one victim in the education sector was no longer able to charge students for school meals, and as a result had to cover the cost of food in the interim. Some companies also offered to pay for counselling services for their staff, but these costs are typically not covered by insurance. Some organisations also paid for credit monitoring for their employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many victims also face additional costs due to increased insurance premiums. While interviewees were often able to renew their cyber insurance policy after a ransomware attack, they had to do so at a higher cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the immediate reaction to a ransomware attack, additional costs may arise when replacing technology, as a ransomware attack often infiltrates many devices, or impairs communications for the victim. The victim may have to acquire additional devices, as was the case for one interviewee, who described how their company replaced all its employees’ phones after a ransomware attack. When phone systems in a local government entity failed due to a ransomware attack, extra telephones and mobile phones had to be acquired to enable staff to communicate with local citizens. Another victim purchased large numbers of Chromebook devices to access their Microsoft 365 environment so as to enable communication between employees and with clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further significant, long-term costs are accrued when improving cyber security measures and updating IT networks. While these measures are not always strictly required in response to a ransomware attack, such incidents often create the impetus for increased cyber security measures and spending. The costly decision to “build back better” is often deemed necessary or even overdue, but not covered by insurance. As a victim in the education sector said, “It’s all a lot of money, but money we should have spent a year earlier”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other long-term costs stem from regulatory fines, although in the UK it is not clear how many fines have been issued to victims of ransomware by the Information Commissioner’s Office. Moreover, decisions on these fines are often only delivered months or even years after an attack, in the meantime weighing on a victim’s mental health and limiting their ability to move on after the incident. Similarly, litigation costs may also only arise months or years after the ransomware attack has occurred. Again, victims often require legal support during these processes, dragging out the additional costs incurred for hiring third parties such as data protection lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some additional costs come in the form of clearly defined bills, others are harder to directly trace back to the ransomware attack. One example of this is the additional cost of employee turnover. While some individuals might lose (or leave) their jobs directly as a result of an attack and need to be replaced, employees’ decisions to leave often have more than one cause. A ransomware attack may be a contributing factor or the tipping point in a decision process, for example due to the stress or anxiety the attack evoked. Other influencing factors – such as the Covid-19 pandemic or an organisation’s existing internal dynamics – make it hard to isolate a ransomware attack as the sole factor causing employee turnover. Nevertheless, exit interviews in the education sector revealed that some teachers leaving the profession cited the ransomware attack as a tipping point, due to some of their data being lost to the attack – something they felt their employer should have protected them from. Another victim described how the ransomware attack led to lower morale among employees, which in turn had “a knock-on effect as people started to leave. It makes those people that are on the fence of … leaving make that decision”. Low morale and other such intangible influences take a long time to overcome, the interviewee noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For other interviewees, ransomware incidents were clearly the reason why people left their jobs, for example due to stress levels experienced during the ransomware response or because the person’s account had been used by the hacker (and, although this was not their fault, the repeated mentioning of their name throughout the response led to them leaving the organisation in question).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higher costs due to employee turnover may also arise because experienced IT staff receive more attractive employment offers from elsewhere. An interviewee in the engineering sector explained that “trying to hold on to people who are battle-tested in that kind of space is extremely difficult because everybody wants them”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, higher costs may occur where staff needs to be – temporarily – replaced due to burnout or other psychological harm. For example, one interviewee described how staff were unable to return to work for months after the ransomware response due to the high stress levels experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, victims often experience a more intangible type of cost: opportunity costs, wherein budgeting is disrupted by the need to redirect resources away from other objectives. A recent survey of 100 directors of UK firms impacted by ransomware identified that their organisations cut operating costs by an average of 17% following their ransomware incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of opportunity costs is likely to affect all victims operating with constrained finances, but may be particularly noticeable for victims in the public sector, such as councils, schools or hospitals, which are already running on tight budgets and have little ability to build back reserves. One interviewee in the public sector described how further cuts in funding put them in a worse position now than they were when the attack occurred, and that, in order to build back reserves, the organisation had to be particularly frugal in its spending and to increase revenue sources. In other ways, opportunity costs stem from reductions in productivity or from diverting staff from other pressing priorities to work on recovering from an incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware victims thus encounter additional costs in many ways, some of which are better anticipated than others. These additional costs often exceed the ransom demand by a significant degree. Moreover, many additional costs only occur in the long term, such as litigation costs or the cost of building back IT networks. Long-term costs can also arise as a consequence of other harms, for example when new employees need to be hired after former employees leave their positions or need to be replaced due to burnout. Some of these costs are covered by insurance providers, but where this is not the case, ransomware victims often have limited insights into the long-term additional costs they face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Losses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the additional costs a victim organisation may face due to a ransomware attack, it may also experience a number of financial losses; indeed, small businesses may face the threat of going out of business. Even where the financial losses do not present an existential threat, they can nevertheless be significant. The following paragraphs provide some examples of the kind of financial losses that can occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business interruption accounts for the majority of financial losses after a ransomware attack – for example, when a company is unable to produce products or provide services to customers. The high financial impact of business interruption was confirmed by a 2022 study of cyber insurance claims for ransomware that found that the average cost of business interruption amounted to $657,000. Similarly, the interview data confirmed the significant financial harm caused by business interruption. One incident responder recalled working with manufacturing firms that were “losing tens, if not hundreds, of millions of euros or pounds a day because … their manufacturing lines were flying [disrupted]”. Business interruption also affected a victim in the charity sector, where the memberships team was unable to collect money from renewed membership subscriptions. As the annual direct debit collection was no longer working, the renewal process (worth £3 million) had to be delayed by a month. Business interruption, including delayed payments, is thus not only a significant financial harm but can also lead to reputational harm if a victim is no longer able to provide their services. While there are generally few examples of organisations going out of business or facing insolvency solely due to a ransomware attack, financial losses due to business interruption can be a significant influence in causing a business to shut down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This factor is closely linked to financial harm caused by loss of expected income, for example where a victim organisation had to cancel several reservations for a venue it offers as a conferencing space. Delay to another victim’s project meant that an education institution was unable to secure funding for further related research. Loss of expected income is of course closely related to the loss of clients. While often mentioned as a feared consequence, loss of clients is often difficult to directly attribute to the ransomware attack. An interviewee in the insurance business explained that although most insured parties do not lose a significant proportion of their customer base, this may happen in certain sectors (in the technology sector, for example, where customers display lower risk tolerance). For organisations that provide immediate services, losing clients may be a more tangible harm, for example in the construction industry, where the inability to provide a service would lead to the client immediately looking for a different supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the financial loss caused by loss of clients or expected income, ransomware attacks also result in a loss of time: the time that is needed to respond and recover. Ransomware attacks are highly disruptive, requiring the attention not just of IT staff but of staff from all departments. Financial harm also arises from time being spent responding to the ransomware attack, rather than on the usual tasks. As a victim in the education sector said, “The time cost is immense … The time cost of not only recovering, but not doing the work that you could have been doing”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to these financial losses and additional costs, interviewees widely regarded ransomware as a severe risk for organisations and potentially even as “business ending … if you haven’t got your data, you don’t have a business”. An executive of a micro-enterprise noted that they would have lost their house and their company would have gone bankrupt if they had not had the cushion of cyber insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While public reporting has highlighted some cases of organisations permanently ceasing to trade after a ransomware incident, none of the victims interviewed reported that their organisation had ceased to be a going concern as the result of a ransomware attack. Interviewees from the ransomware recovery ecosystem (for example, incident responders and cyber insurers) were also hard-pressed to identify concrete cases where an organisation had ceased trading altogether. This may indicate a degree of selection bias: for example, organisations that were unable to afford incident response or did not have cyber insurance would not have been on these professionals’ radar. The limited cases of this kind that interviewees could recall tended to relate to the healthcare sector – such as a fertility clinic holding highly sensitive data – where it was the combination of business interruption and irrecoverable reputational harm that resulted in the business folding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reputational Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside any financial impact, harm to their external reputation is often a primary concern for victim organisations. Victims fear reputational harm arising either from media reporting or because customers and clients realise that the organisation is unable to provide a particular service. In some instances, victims have a contractual or regulatory – if not a moral – obligation to disclose that they have experienced a ransomware incident. Such incidents are, however, typically perceived as reflecting organisational weakness, and victims – who are also often subject to victim blaming – often fear that this will affect their reputation and professional credentials. A victim in the technology sector felt that “we were humiliated in front of the customer”, while another victim, in the education sector, confirmed that their “biggest bit of damage was probably reputational and confidence”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The driver behind such fear is the assumption that reputational harm in turn also leads to financial harm, for example due to loss of expected income or loss of clients. One employee at a manufacturing company recollected that customers would repeatedly ask about the ransomware incident even months after the attack, and that rumours about customers’ leaked personal data added to the reputational harm done. As a result, the company was perceived as being less safe, and questions were raised about whether larger competitors were a safer choice for doing business with, indicating that this perception could have resulted in/contributed to a loss of orders. Furthermore, the employee also noticed an impact on customer relations, as open communication with customers was prohibited, resulting in a feeling of lost trust among customers, who thought the employee knew more than they were telling. This echoes a risk highlighted more widely in reporting on the subject: that, where there is an alternative supplier, the reputational fallout from a ransomware incident can include the loss of existing and future customers. In 2023, the hosting firms CloudNordic and AzeroCloud experienced ransomware attacks which irrevocably removed some hosted client data; the director of the companies said publicly that he did not expect many customers to remain with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reputational harm is often especially impactful for smaller firms providing professional services, particularly where there is an “implied and contractual level of confidentiality” – for example, in legal or accountancy firms. Customers perceive that it is part of these organisations’ duty – but also their business model – to guard customers’ personal information, which is often of a sensitive nature. In these instances, the disappointment and loss of trust increases the risk of reputational harm. Victim blaming after an attack can further aggravate reputational harm, including via social media platforms. While less pertinent for some of the interviewees at organisations that are less exposed to direct financial implications as a result of reputational damage (for example, because they are public sector organisations with no real competitors), reputational harm can thus have a significant impact on organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while the fear of reputational harm heavily influences victims’ decision- making, some interviewees, including crisis communications experts and lawyers, indicated that reputational harm may not be as severe as has been assumed in the literature. One interviewee did not think that there is “stigma attached to being the victim of a cyber attack in the same way that there was inthe past”. Some victims said they had supportive clients or, in the case of schools and universities, students. A victim in the professional services sector found that the attack “did not do damage to our reputation as much as one might think, clients were quite sympathetic”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the extent of reputational harm caused by a ransomware attack appears to be highly contingent and based on a range of factors. Some interviewees, for instance, highlighted that sympathy is likely to be dependent on the context of the incident and the nature of the business. One interviewee noted that their inability to speak openly about the incident led to increasingly strained interactions with clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some interviewees also indicated that, if data exfiltration occurred, “the risk of reputational harm is much greater”. The same is true if customer services are interrupted. An interviewee at a professional services provider found that clients were “reasonably sympathetic” as long as the company was still able to provide the relevant services and secure their data. Other interviewees highlighted that the timing, cadence and tone of client communications was an important consideration for minimising harms to the organisation, its staff, clients and other third parties. While each ransomware case will be different, it was emphasised that there was a balance to be struck between transparency and opacity, particularly with a public audience. Such assessments are speculative, but again illustrate the prominence that the fear of reputational harm has for victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important finding from the interview data was that reputational damage can also occur within the impacted organisation itself. This is particularly likely where internal communication is poor, and especially among employees who are not directly involved in responding to the incident and who may, as a result, feel excluded. A victim in the professional services sector, who found that external reputational damage was not as significant as expected, said that the attack was indeed “more damaging to our internal reputation”, adding that the attack’s impact on morale made the organisation a bad place for people to work and that people were leaving as a result, with the organisation’s reputation as an employer also suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, victim organisations are often concerned about experiencing reputational harm as a result of media reporting. The interviewees for this project only mentioned a small number of examples of negative reporting in the media. Individual cases are not discussed here, given the risk of inadvertent attribution, but the interviews made clear that the fear of negative press often meant that victims – particularly those in the private sector – were less likely to be transparent about the attack. One victim spoke of negative publicity on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First-Order Harms to Staff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the harm experienced by an organisation itself, the individuals who work for (or own) an organisation that has fallen victim to a ransomware attack are also directly impacted. As an interviewee in the charity sector put it, “everyone was affected in a way, but just to different degrees”. The degree to which staff members experience harm depends on a number of factors, including the extent to which they are involved in the immediate incident response and whether there are underlying issues, such as pre-existing health conditions. This section provides an overview of the different ways in which staff members may be negatively impacted by a ransomware attack, including psychological, physical, financial, reputational and social harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychological Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to public reporting, which often focuses on the financial harm of ransomware attacks, our interviews stressed that the first-order harm employees experience is primarily of a psychological nature. Interviewees repeatedly emphasised that psychological impacts are often overlooked in the wider discourse on ransomware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychological impacts are naturally perceived at an individual level and are therefore highly subjective. The categories of psychological harm listed here are therefore not based on medical definitions but are guided by the interview data and by the words that individuals used to describe their feelings. Furthermore, psychological and physical harms are often closely interlinked, especially where psychological harm has physical consequences, such as mental burnout leading to tiredness or physical exhaustion. The distinction between the psychological and the physical is thus not always straightforward, but, to avoid duplication, not all harms are listed in both categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primarily, experiencing and responding to a ransomware attack creates considerable stress for the individuals involved. For example, an interviewee from the engineering sector confirmed, “There’s a huge amount of pressure and stress that everybody was under”, to the extent that their company hired a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) support team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While stress was widely reported, the interview data shows that individuals experience different forms of stress, depending on their position and allotted tasks. An interviewee in the professional services sector explained how management- and board-level employees felt stress due to financial concerns, while people in the middle management tier were stressed by the extremely long workdays, including particularly stressful communications with the threat actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress is often particularly grave for individuals in involved IT teams. One external service provider went so far as to state that “the IT staff – they’re the main victims of crime here”. An interviewee from the education sector explained that the human toll on the IT service was especially severe due to their detailed understanding of the gravity of the situation, adding that the impact on the IT team was, however, often not talked about. As the technical details of attacks are often difficult to understand, the wider perception is that “magical IT will come and sort it all out”, obscuring how stressful this experience can be for the IT team. Stress is also particularly prominent for IT teams because they feel a direct responsibility for protecting an organisation’s systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although stress is thus often acknowledged as a harm inflicted by ransomware attacks, the interview data implied that the more detailed impact of stress, particularly on IT teams, is often overlooked and insufficiently addressed. This is particularly regrettable, as in some instances stress on staff is so significant that it leads to other harms such as burnout or other sickness, leading personnel to leave their jobs or to be absent temporarily on sick leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with stress, victims also often described a feeling of confusion and loss of orientation in the initial phase of a ransomware attack, especially where victims were not familiar with technical details or did not yet have enough information to form a full picture of the situation. The loss of orientation may be rooted in there being insufficient preparation or procedures in place, while confusion can also stem from victims questioning why they have been attacked, or from uncertainty among staff about what is going on and how they should respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is the case for other categories of harm, victims noted that emotional reactions to ransomware attacks also varied with time. For example, a victim in the education sector said that “those first few hours are quite horrific actually, until you get into a position where you start working out what the facts are”. Others described feelings of very low mood in the first week after the attack. One victim recalled a burdensome feeling that they “for the foreseeable future belonged to the criminal underworld”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some victims of ransomware attacks were also said to be angry, for example when an insurance provider recalled client interactions with victims who were angry at the attackers, questioning why they had been targeted. Other interviewees said that former employees whose data was exfiltrated were also less sympathetic but “much more angry”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial reactions of panic in the wake of a ransomware attack can also cause psychological harm. One interviewee said “there was a terror about what might happen next”. On a related note, worry was a typical harm experienced by victims, for example worry about reputational risk, but also, while responding to an attack, worry about whether they were taking the right actions. An external counsel noted that “it’s a harm in itself of distress and worry of making the wrong decision”. A victim in the education sector spoke of a fear of recovering the IT systems too quickly, in case criminals still had access to the networks. Fear of a repeated incident also affected other victims: when receiving suspicious emails or similar, even after the ransomware incident had been dealt with, victims experienced a sense of “PTSD” (in the non-technical sense used by lay people), for example saying that “there was a bit of a PTSD about every time I walked through the office door”. Others described a sense of fear over potential job losses as a result of the ransomware attack. These feelings underline how personally victims experience an attack, and how a ransomware incident casts a shadow over their personal and professional life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviews revealed a number of further emotional harms that were experienced in response to ransomware attacks, stressing how wide-ranging the psychological impacts can be. The difficult decision about whether to pay the ransom demanded often weighs heavily on victims and is not a purely financial or risk management decision: it often raises feelings of guilt, an aspect often overlooked when considering the seemingly binary decision to pay or not to pay. A victim in the education sector described how challenging it was to make a decision in this context, given that they believed “it’s not ethical to pay the ransom”. This concern had, however, to be balanced against students’ potential delay to their studies. While the interviewee believed it was ultimately right to pay the ransom in this instance, they also stressed that “we’re not happy with the decision of paying”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to the feeling of guilt are feelings of shame and self-blame. An interviewee from the charity sector said “we all blame ourselves” – a human reaction that was difficult to overcome. Some members of IT teams can feel particularly responsible, often because they feel that they knew about potential system problems and did not raise them sufficiently, subsequently blaming themselves and burning themselves out working on the ransomware response. Again, this underlines the overlooked – but heightened – impact that ransomware attacks have on the mental wellbeing of IT teams in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews also highlighted that ransomware attacks caused feelings of doubt and resignation among victims, again underlining how personal the attack is felt to be by its victims. One interviewee said the incident made them doubt everything they had done. Similarly, another interviewee said that the incident made them question whether they had run their business properly, because “at that time you second guess yourself, [and] that adds to the mental anxiety”. Another victim described a sense of doubt about whether they were doing enough, but also a feeling of resignation “to the fact that if someone wants to get in [and] if they have enough time and enough energy and enough effort – they’ll get in”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent research shows that the range of psychological harm experienced, and its severity, can affect victims’ mental health. Indeed, interviewees overwhelmingly felt that this aspect was often overlooked in popular discourse. One victim concluded that “the overall piece is that we very rarely talk about the mental health impact of these events”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other categories of harm, psychological harm continues far beyond the immediate timeframe of the incident, creating an additional mental health burden and making it challenging for victims to move on after the incident. Victims repeatedly mentioned concerns over the role of the Information Commissioner’s Office and the impact that the prospect of being fined had on their mental state. The challenge of moving on mentally after an incident was also reported by an interviewee in the education sector, who said that subsequent Ofsted surveys revealed that “some staff are still very raw about this. When you ask them about workload, they may well say the ransomware attack … made our lives hell”. Another victim felt “a real disappointment” given that their company was ultimately unable to find out how the attacker gained access to their systems. Indeed, one victim went as far as to say that the attack made them feel like they had “failed”. Another victim found the ransomware attack “actually really traumatic” (especially given their strong identification with success in business, and in their own business in particular), indicating that this had brought them close to suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interview data shows that not only is the psychological impact of ransomware incidents overlooked in the short term, but that the long-term psychological impact of attacks is even less likely to be noticed (or sufficiently addressed) than immediate harms such as stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the psychological harm a ransomware attack causes is of course highly context specific and also depends on the individuals involved and their existing mental health conditions, the interviews stressed the significance, extent and multiplicity of ways in which victims experience psychological harm. Such psychological harm can reach far beyond the immediate response to a specific incident, affecting an individual’s wider professional life and impacting their personal life. Interviewees repeatedly noted that the psychological impact of ransomware attacks is insufficiently recognised, not only by the broader public, but also in academic and/or industry studies and within the organisations responding to such attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research data demonstrates how central the psychological impact is to victim experience and how varied the psychological harm is, especially for IT teams. In turn, such psychological impact on individuals also has financial impact for victim organisations, for example where it affects productivity, when staff suffer burnout and need replacing, or in terms of other forms of employee turnover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physical Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victims’ physical health also suffers in the wake of ransomware attacks. Physical harms reported by interviewees ranged from minor ailments (for instance, weight changes) to serious health issues (such as heart attack or stroke). While not a commonplace occurrence, one law enforcement interviewee noted that they knew of a member of IT staff at an organisation who took their own life following a ransomware incident. Far more commonly, interviewees reported sleep deprivation and follow-on impacts, with employees falling asleep at the office or reporting problems sleeping at home. One victim reported that “the fatigue on people was extreme”, referring to physical but also mental exhaustion, illustrating how closely linked the two harms are. This is also true for harms such as burnout, which can manifest in both mental and physical ways. Other reported physical impacts included weight loss and dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interviewee even reported health issues within their team that resulted in hospitalisation, with employees not looking after themselves well in the immediate response to a ransomware attack, for example by drinking too much coffee and not enough water (which in this instance resulted in the need for hospital checks because of pre-existing heart complications). In a more grievous example, a victim experienced a heart attack and required surgery, citing the stress of managing the incident as a key factor. Physical harm is thus closely linked to the mental harm experienced, such as stress and anxiety; this can be especially grave where victims have underlying health conditions (albeit this is the exception rather than the rule).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While wider reporting of ransomware incidents often focuses on the financial impact for organisations or the economy more broadly, the interview data stresses that financial harm is also experienced by individual staff members. (The distinction is, of course, somewhat superfluous in the case of sole traders or freelancers, whose individual financial situation is hardly distinguishable from that of their business.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees can suffer financial harm as a result of a ransomware attack, for example if they lose their job as a result of the attack – an outcome that is more likely for members of the IT team or an organisation’s board members. An external counsel reported that, especially where a publicly listed company pays the ransom, board members are likely to be changed within six months to a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many victims reported that their organisation was still able to meet payroll despite the ransomware attack, this was often because the incident came just after staff had been paid, or otherwise that it had been a close call with regard to meeting payroll during response to the incident. Not being paid, or being underpaid (for example, because a recent pay rise has been ignored due to fallback to earlier backups of personnel data), is thus another way in which a ransomware attack can financially impact staff members. Another example of harm was described by one victim, who paid for their own therapy sessions (which were not covered by insurance) and had to cancel holiday plans in order to make time to respond to an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reputational Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like organisations, individual staff members may also be concerned about suffering reputational harm as the result of a ransomware attack. This is particularly true for IT staff, who often feel that they may not have done enough to prevent the incident from occurring. They might also be blamed by board members or other senior staff for not doing what might superficially be considered “doing their job”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reputational harm is also a problem for staff who might have clicked on a malicious link (allowing ransomware to access the organisation’s systems) or whose credentials have been abused during the attack. Even if they were not necessarily responsible for the breach, their reputation might suffer if they are erroneously assigned blame by superiors or colleagues. Blaming individuals and contributing to their reputational harm might also cause them further psychological harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the psychological, physical and financial harm caused, a ransomware attack can also impact employees’ professional lives, and the social relations between members of staff, and their relationships outside work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the psychological harm experienced by staff members can have wider impacts on social relations within an organisation or team, potentially leading to strained relationships with colleagues. One victim described employees as being “grumpier”, amid increased workloads and diminished pastoral care. Others noted the negative effect on morale and said that the repeated complaints of colleagues were “annoying”. Work relationships might also become strained if external help is hired. One victim described how the in-house IT team felt challenged when an external IT team was hired as additional help, with poor integration leading to duplication of efforts and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of ransomware attacks is, however, also felt beyond social relations in a professional context, extending into private and family life. Some victims reported missing out on personal or family life. One victim described “a personal toll”, particularly given increased commuting demands and long working hours. The impact on personal life was also felt by a victim in the technology sector who described a “work–life balance loss through extended hours of working weekends”. Another interviewee, who coordinated incident response, described how he personally provided impromptu childcare for one of their chief IT technicians, so that the technician could be “hands-on-keyboard”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those staff members who are not part of an organisation’s “core” ransomware response team also experience harm to their professional and private lives, although the nature of the harm may differ from that of those forming part of the “inner circle”. Those outside the immediate response team might feel “like really nobody had a handle on it” and feel left out of the communication loop, receiving little information about what is going on. Understandably, there is also a degree to which professional and personal life entwine, particularly where staff pursue their work as a personal passion. Interviewees also noted that some staff treated the ransomware attack as an opportunity – or impetus – to resign from their role or take retirement; for instance, educational staff who had lost many years’ worth of teaching materials. Another interviewee noted that staff who had been with their organisation for decades felt a form of “love” towards the archives of data that they had personally collected during their career, and felt bereft at the loss of this data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many staff members experience different degrees of ransomware harm, which in turn have negative impacts on their professional and private lives. Such negative impacts are closely tied to the psychological impact staff members experience, again demonstrating the interconnectivity of harms – as well as the wide range of forms that psychological harm can take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section has illustrated the categories of harm experienced by direct victims of ransomware attacks: that is, the organisations and staff members who experience the ransomware attack. Organisations face potential digital/physical, financial and reputational harm, while staff members may encounter financial, reputational, psychological, physical and social harm. Importantly, though, harm is also felt beyond these first-order harms, extending to those who indirectly experience harm as a result of a ransomware attack. The following sections illustrate what these second- and third-order harms can look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;second-order-harms&quot;&gt;Second-Order Harms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second category of harms involves organisations and individuals indirectly harmed by ransomware. The former group includes organisations that are customers/clients or in the supply chain of a victim entity that has had its IT systems encrypted or data stolen, while the latter group – individuals – refers to the customers or users of a public or private organisation that provides services or holds data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research conducted for this paper highlights that, the further “downstream” we get from the initial impact of the attack, the more challenging it is to effectively characterise and illustrate harms to organisations. However, the research has been able to identify a range of second-order harms to organisations and individuals through the interviews with direct victims, third-party experts and law enforcement, and via academic literature and media reporting. The results of a ransomware-harm modelling exercise conducted as part of this project and published as an academic conference paper have also been important in highlighting the different types of harms that can indirectly affect individuals, particularly healthcare patients and residents of local authorities that are affected by ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the various types of second-order harms from ransomware operations help emphasise their long tail and wide reach, shedding light on the various ways in which individuals are impacted by ransomware attacks. Ransomware attacks that disrupt the operations of businesses and public services have cascading effects that harm the lives of citizens of the UK and many other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JEKyuJe.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Types of Second-Order Harms Affecting Downstream Organisations and Individuals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second-Order Harms to Organisations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As illustrated in Figure 4, ransomware operations have the potential to create a range of second-order harms for organisations and their employees, even when they are not directly targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware attacks on outsourced IT services, such as managed service providers or cloud hosting providers, can harm organisations’ digital systems and data. A 2022 ransomware operation against Rackspace Technology, a cloud hosting provider, encrypted Microsoft Exchange email servers and caused thousands of SMEs to lose access to email services for several days. A more recent ransomware attack against CloudNordic, a cloud services provider, resulted in customers losing all their data after the company’s backups were deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruptions to organisations’ supply chains and subsequent harms are not limited to ransomware attacks on technology providers. Nor are they a rare exception, with data indicating that 52% of firms say that one of their suppliers has experienced a ransomware attack. Physical supply chains can be particularly sensitive to ransomware harm: attacks against organisations in sectors such as manufacturing and logistics can create cascading effects that spread financial and reputational harm down the supply chain as suppliers and customers experience delays and loss of trust. One interviewee from the manufacturing sector, for example, highlighted how a ransomware attack against their company resulted in delays to their customers’ operations; in some cases, this resulted in customers finding new suppliers. Interviews also highlighted that being downstream from a ransomware attack can be even more challenging than being at the epicentre, as access to information about the attack may be much more limited. As a breach response lawyer argued, second-order harms may be “in a way, slightly worse, because you’re reliant on [the organisation experiencing the ransomware attack] for information … but they’re not going to be able to give you complete information in the early stages”. In some cases, suppliers experiencing ransomware attacks may even attempt to pretend the ransomware attack is not happening in an effort to reduce their own reputational harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sense, first- and second-order harms are not discrete – rather, they are closely linked. Severe second-order harms are likely to multiply the extent of harm or pressure on the direct victim organisation. For instance, an insurance claims handler recalled supporting an industrial system supplier to the fast food industry. The victim emphasised to the interviewee that their clients had zero tolerance for downtime; kitchens were supposed to be operating at full capacity in a context where fryers and other equipment would routinely break down, warranting rapid repair. If the victim could not return to operations within a matter of hours or days, they would be “booted off” contracts worth millions of pounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also increasingly common for organisations to have data stolen by ransomware threat actors via their suppliers’ systems. When Capita, a major provider of outsourced IT services in the UK, was targeted by cyber-criminals using BlackBasta ransomware, more than 90 of its customers had data stolen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listing all the various potential types of financial, reputational, physical, psychological and social second-order harms to organisations and their employees from ransomware is beyond the scope of this paper, given that the interviews and workshops focused predominantly on the experiences of direct victims. However, it is reasonable to conclude that second-order harms may take a similar form to the first-order harms listed in the previous section, since they ultimately stem from disruption to business operations and the theft of data. In this sense, the harms experienced by third parties can be comparable to those experienced by the direct victim (rather than being seen as vicarious nuisance). As one breach response lawyer articulated, “If you’re reliant on someone that has an incident, you can’t do business as a result of their incident, then clearly you’re in a pretty similar position in a way, insofar as you may not be able to do business properly”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second-Order Harms to Individuals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware also creates a range of second-order harms – some of which are sector specific – for individuals downstream from the initial victim. Here, the term “individuals” refers to customers or users of goods and services, including people from groups such as hospital patients or schoolchildren. Given the digital dependencies of most businesses and service providers in modern economies and societies, individuals have significant exposure to ransomware harms. This paper’s research shows that individuals who are already vulnerable, such as patients seeking medical treatment or people receiving benefits, are disproportionately impacted by the indirect harm caused by ransomware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physical Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a growing body of evidence that ransomware causes downstream harm to the physical health of individuals, most significantly when such harm reduces health outcomes at hospitals after attacks. Many ransomware groups have been ruthless in directly targeting hospitals and healthcare providers, showing scant regard for the impact on essential services and patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the attack on Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE) by the Conti ransomware group illustrates, the disruption of IT services can cause cascading harms to clinical services and patients. Attacks against hospitals have forced elective surgeries to be cancelled and disrupted patient services such as cancer treatments. During the HSE attack, for instance, radiation therapy stopped at five centres, while 513 patients had their cancer treatment disrupted. In other cases, ransomware attacks have caused emergency services to be diverted to other hospitals; in critical care services, where minutes or hours can determine whether a patient lives or dies, these kinds of diversions can reduce survivability and recovery. One recent report has suggested that between 2016 and 2021, between 42 and 67 Medicare patients in the US died as a result of ransomware incidents, while several surveys and studies indicate that ransomware attacks are linked to increased mortality rates at affected hospitals. In a recent survey of healthcare professionals in the US by the Ponemon Institute, for example, 24% of respondents said their hospital experienced an increase in excess deaths following a ransomware attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other effects may be less noticeable, but nevertheless still degrade the quality of care individuals receive. Losing access to electronic health records, for instance, forces doctors and nurses to revert to pen and paper; this reduces productivity, which in turn limits the number of patients that can be treated. In the longer term, patients whose detailed records inform choices about their treatment receive less effective care if those records are inaccessible or corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware can affect individuals’ physical health even if their healthcare provision is not disrupted. The attack on Hackney Council, for example, contributed to delays in repairs to social housing stock. According to reporting, one resident’s home suffered damp, mould and leaks after the council lost access to records about the property. Disruptions to the provision of social care can also cause physical harms: a disabled resident in Hackney told a journalist that the ransomware attack had prevented her from accessing social care services for several months – “I could not wash myself. I couldn’t wash my own hair”. These examples highlight how ransomware attacks against local government entities can be particularly harmful, due to the range of basic services these entities provide, further emphasising that it is the already vulnerable who are disproportionately affected by the second-order harms caused by ransomware attacks. Policymakers must consider what policy measures can be taken to protect these vulnerable people from such harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In extreme circumstances, the exfiltration and release of data also has the potential to expose individuals to varying degrees of personal physical risk. This stems from an emergent trend in which ransomware operators exfiltrate data from organisations that hold highly sensitive personal data – for instance, schools and law firms. A severe example highlighted in interviews was the possible doxing of relocated domestic abuse survivors following the theft of data from a law firm; the malicious public release of such data could put such individuals and those around them at extreme personal risk. An interviewee from the education sector recalled feeling relief when they realised that the ransomware operators involved in their attack had gained access to commercial data – including payroll – but did not get access to pupil safeguarding data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware also has the potential to harm individuals financially. In some cases, second-order financial harm can stem from disruption to particular financial services or goods; or, in a small number of cases, from the risks associated with stolen and leaked personal financial information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, ransomware operations against local authorities have disrupted residents’ ability to access housing benefits, again disproportionately impacting those who were already vulnerable. One senior leader at a council described the “massive disruption” to local residents, recounting that “people couldn’t pay their rent”. Hackney Council’s housing benefit services were also significantly impacted, and in July 2022 a news report suggested that a family of seven living in Hackney had been forced to leave their home because the council was unable to update their housing benefit payments. A UK law enforcement officer said that disruptions to state benefits “might stop [residents] being able to put food on the table for their kids”. Critically for policymakers, these examples highlight how personally ransomware attacks are experienced, and how already vulnerable groups are disproportionately affected by them – problems that require nuanced consideration when designing policy responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More intangible are the potential downstream impacts from ransomware attacks on the costs of goods and services for individual consumers. Although this research did not uncover specific evidence of price rises for consumers following ransomware attacks, a study by IBM highlights that 62% of firms affected by ransomware raised their prices in the aftermath. It is reasonable to expect that some price rises may be directly felt by individuals, particularly for consumer-facing services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a small possibility that individuals whose personal data is stolen by ransomware operators may be personally extorted or defrauded by other cyber-criminals in the ransomware ecosystem. On a small number of occasions, threat actors have tried to personally extort individuals whose data has been stolen as part of a ransomware operation, the most notable example being the theft of healthcare data from a Finnish therapy provider by cyber-criminals, who then also extorted patients. However, interviewees highlighted that this example is likely to be the exception rather than the rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An insurance claims interviewee recalled an attack on a private school, wherein the ransomware operators directly contacted pupils’ parents before delivering the ransomware payload. These fraudulent emails offered parents a 10% discount on forthcoming school fees if the parents made an expedited payment (to a false payment address). This reflects the relatively new ransomware attack model of “triple extortion”, wherein the threat actors not only encrypt and exfiltrate data held by the direct victim organisation, but also target secondary parties (clients) to solicit additional payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media reports on ransomware, particularly incidents involving large stolen datasets, often speculate that stolen and leaked personally identifiable information and financial details might be used for identity theft and fraud. However, the research conducted for this paper suggests that ransomware operators or other cyber-criminals are not monetising stolen personal data in a systematic way. Interviewees and workshop participants from incident response, law firms and law enforcement all emphasised there is little evidence that ransomware operators are cleaning and aggregating stolen data in a way that would allow them to sell it to other cyber-criminals or use it for financial fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are likely several reasons why ransomware criminals do not currently exploit stolen data for further criminal gains. First, for the time being, it is simply much more profitable for criminals in the ransomware ecosystem to engage in or enable extortion-based crimes. Second, it is costly and time consuming to host, clean and aggregate stolen data in a way that would be useful and monetisable. A ransomware negotiator noted that a personal record for an individual was likely to be worth between $1 and $4, thus offering limited profitability unless the dataset was ordered in a readily hostable and saleable format. The saleability of such data is also likely to be hampered by the cost of server storage and the unreliability of darknet-hosted platforms. As a lawyer involved in breach response explained, lawyers and forensic experts often take weeks or months (with the use of specialist software) trying to figure out what type of data has been stolen during a ransomware incident, a process which cyber-criminals are unlikely to have the resources or inclination to emulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these factors suggest that the potential financial harm to individuals from data stolen by ransomware threat actors is not as significant as many people believe. While policymakers must be aware that further extortion from leaked data is a possibility, this impact should not be overestimated, although this should certainly not distract attention from the concrete psychological harm that victims experience (and which is currently often overlooked). However, this does not rule out cyber-criminals or other threat actors exploiting this data in the future, particularly if technological changes enable them to aggregate it more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychological Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware can also cause psychological harm to individuals who are not involved with the immediate response or who do not work for the targeted organisation. Although the research conducted for this paper does not include interviews with victims from outside (direct) victim organisations, other sources such as media reporting, academic literature and our interviews with subject matter experts illustrate some of the negative impacts from ransomware on individuals’ mental health and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, ransomware attacks that cause downtime for essential services like healthcare, local government and education can cause stress, anxiety, confusion and fear for the individuals who use these entities’ services. Beyond the immediate impact on physical health stemming from ransomware attacks on healthcare services, the mental health effects on patients and families have also been made clear in news coverage. Delays to important test results or outpatient services like cancer treatments or elective surgeries can cause distress and anxiety for patients and their families, as the attack against HSE illustrated. The interruption of local government services such as social care, housing and child benefits, and council housing can also lead to stress and even anger among affected residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the rise of double-extortion ransomware operations has created additional psychological harms for individuals whose data has been stolen and leaked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the concrete risk of fraud and identify theft related to data stolen by ransomware threat actors appears to be low, this is not the dominant public perception. As one incident response practitioner suggested, “you can’t necessarily reassure [people] who, through no fault of their own, have had all of their details compromised”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2yq5e5a.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Ransomware Incidents Involving Exposure of Personal Data.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://therecord.media/ransomware-attacks-record-in-UK&quot;&gt;Alexander Martin, Ransomware Attacks Hit Record Level in UK, According to Neglected Official Data’, The Record, 12 September 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As highlighted in Figure 5, a range of personal data can be impacted by ransomware incidents. When particularly sensitive data, such as private photos or medical records, is stolen and leaked, it has the potential to create psychological harm such as considerable levels of stress, anxiety and embarrassment for individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, one legacy of the recent surge in ransomware attacks targeting schools is the exposure of large amounts of safeguarding data and other sensitive pupil records. Following a ransomware attack against Minneapolis schools in March 2023, threat actors leaked intimate and graphic reports about students that included descriptions of sexual assaults, domestic violence and mental health issues. Many of the most sensitive files were posted on Twitter and Facebook, increasing the chance of families and pupils discovering them. Although none of the UK schools interviewed had pupil data stolen and leaked, one leader at an academy trust emphasised that the attack on their schools caused fear among pupils, as they understood they were being targeted by criminals. And while the Minneapolis schools example comes from a US context, similar events could also occur in the UK. Moreover, the fact that ransomware threat actors are finding it harder to monetise their operations means that there is a risk of them adopting the kind of extreme “shaming” tactics like the ones used in the Minneapolis schools incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth emphasising that first-order harms to organisations and second-order harms to individuals can flow in both directions. For instance, a client’s psychological distress may be sufficient for secondary victims to file legal action against organisations compromised by ransomware. In a recent case, patients launched a lawsuit against a cosmetic surgery provider after their pre- and post-operation photographs were leaked by ransomware operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second-order harms to organisations and individuals largely resemble the first-order harms. For organisations that experience indirect harm because a supplier has suffered a ransomware attack, this means they can still experience financial, reputational or physical/digital harm, but also often lack first-hand information about the evolving situation. Like the staff members who are direct victims of a ransomware attack, individuals outside the targeted organisation can also experience financial, psychological, or physical harm indirectly in the wake of the attack. Finally, although the risk to individuals due to ransomware operators’ theft of personal data is currently low, this calculus could change in the future if cyber-criminals develop the intent and capability to exploit such data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;third-order-harms&quot;&gt;Third-Order Harms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This category of harms describes the cumulative effects of ransomware incidents on a state’s economy, society and national security. Taken together, these harms emphasise the threat ransomware poses to states, as well as to organisations and individuals. It should be noted, however, that there are significant knowledge gaps about the impact of ransomware at a national level. This makes it challenging to assess the severity of the harm caused by ransomware to the UK and other countries, and creates the risk that governments will not prioritise and properly resource responses to ransomware. This chapter draws on examples from both the UK and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/197HLII.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Third-Order Harms to the Economy, National Security and Society.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Economic Harms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware has the potential to create considerable economic harm at a national level. However, there are significant challenges to be overcome when assessing the cost that ransomware exacts on the UK economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As highlighted elsewhere in this paper, ransomware operations generate costs and losses for victims, reduce productivity, lead to missed opportunities for growth, and disrupt supply chains, in turn spreading financial harms downstream to businesses of all kinds and scales. Disruptions of specific sectors or of individual companies that have significant market share of niche (but essential) products for global or national supply chains also have the potential to cause economic harm. One recent example of this was a ransomware attack against MKS, a US manufacturer that produces specialist parts and tools that are essential for companies making semiconductor chips. The incident caused disruptions to the semiconductor supply chain – an essential component of modern digital infrastructure and the global economy. As the challenges posed by Covid-19, geopolitical tensions and energy price rises have highlighted in recent years, disruptions to supply chains can have a wide range of negative effects that reach into all corners of a modern economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sensitivity of modern globalised supply chains means that disruption to the operations of just one contributory logical element – for instance, imports at ports – have the potential to cause economic harm at scale. An interviewee with first-hand experience of a protracted ransomware event in a developing country noted that its society had “a total dependency on the customs system. Therefore, when this service disappeared, the imports and exports disappeared, the fruits were lost by the docks, they rotted. The technological products that we import, they were blocked. Everything was scarce in the country”. Developed countries are also vulnerable to societal harms resulting from attacks on freight-related systems. A November 2023 incident against a shipping firm – responsible for 40% of Australian goods traffic – left shipping containers stuck at Australian ports. This incident reportedly threatened the supply of Christmas goods, risked higher inflation, and raised the prospect of a future interest rate increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while it is possible to describe the types of economic harms that ransomware causes a country, it is considerably more challenging to accurately calculate economic costs and losses. In order to assess the scale and scope of economic harm to the UK from ransomware, reliable costings for incidents are required, as well as aggregated quantitative data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Existing governmental, law enforcement and regulatory reporting mechanisms have several limitations in this regard. The UK Information Commissioner’s Office has published data showing that since Q2 2019, there have been 1,940 ransomware incidents in the UK that required notification due to the risk to personal data. However, data protection reporting is not focused on financial costs, and many attacks may not require ICO notification if the incident only encrypts servers that do not hold personal data. Reporting of ransomware incidents to law enforcement, meanwhile, is likely much lower. The UK’s NCA, for instance, has estimated that less than 10% of victims report ransomware attacks to Action Fraud (the UK’s national centre for reporting fraud and cybercrime). Moreover, existing Action Fraud reporting mechanisms are not designed to capture the variety of costs and losses that ransomware imposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in the section on first-order financial harms, surveys and other forms of research by cyber security vendors can shed some light on mean/median financial costs. Sophos’s annual survey on ransomware includes figures on ransom payments, recovery costs and loss of business (although the 2023 version did not include these for the UK), while IBM’s annual Cost of a Data Breach report also includes the average cost of a ransomware attack. Coveware, an incident response firm specialising in ransomware, also produces quarterly reports on mean/median ransom payments and incident length. However, there is no standardised approach for calculating the costs and losses from ransomware, or their long-tail financial impact on other organisations, individuals or the economy. As a 2021 report from the US’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency highlighted, there are considerable barriers to putting a value on the economic harm of ransomware and cyber incidents, be it for an individual victimised organisation or a country’s economy as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harms to National Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware is now widely considered to be a threat to national security in the US, Germany, Canada and the UK, among others. Two primary harms to national security emanate from ransomware: the disruption of CNI and strategic sectors, with knock-on effects on economic prosperity and public safety; and the strategic advantage that ransomware can create for hostile states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware operations targeting CNI in a number of different countries are now well publicised. The disruption of emergency services, energy infrastructure, telecommunications and healthcare has demonstrated the ability (or potential) of ransomware threat actors to cause harms to public safety. In some cases, ransomware operations have explicit implications for national defence. There are now several examples of cyber-criminals targeting defence and aerospace companies, disrupting defence supply chains, or stealing sensitive data on intellectual property or military personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth of ransomware has also created strategic advantages for some states hostile to the UK and its allies. In the case of North Korea, ransomware operations by threat actors linked to the North Korean state are primarily financially motivated and aim to generate revenue for the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Russian-speaking ransomware ecosystem provides a number of advantages to the Russian state. Although the Russian state does not direct all cyber activity that emanates from within its borders, it provides a safe harbour, maintains close ties to some cyber-criminals or groups, and co-opts them or their capabilities for its own needs. In 2019, the US Treasury highlighted the direct relationship between Evil Corp, a Russian cyber-criminal organisation responsible for a number of ransomware attacks, and Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB); the same US Treasury advisory note suggested that Maksim Yakubets, one of the leaders of Evil Corp, was directly tasked by the FSB to conduct cyber espionage on its behalf. In a similar vein, the organised cyber-criminal group linked to the Conti ransomware operation was reportedly tasked by the FSB to collect intelligence on researchers at Bellingcat, an investigative non-profit organisation whose reporting has frequently embarrassed the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ransomware ecosystem also provides more indirect benefits to the Russian state. Russian intelligence units can benefit from using services, malware or tools developed by the criminal ecosystem to augment their own capabilities or provide plausible deniability for their own operations. Moreover, while the vast majority of ransomware operations conducted by Russian cyber-criminals are financially, rather than ideologically, motivated, the fact that they harm the economic and societal resilience of the Kremlin’s adversaries in North America and Europe is a useful by-product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Societal Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has been argued elsewhere, ransomware creates a range of societal harms. Disruption of basic services, the diversion of resources from other priorities, and citizens’ potential loss of trust in the state to protect them all illustrate the impact of ransomware on modern societies. These types of harm are arguably less well understood or prioritised than those that more obviously affect economic prosperity and national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As highlighted earlier in this paper, the disruption of healthcare providers can degrade the quality of care that individual patients receive. Several participants stressed that the HSE incident in Ireland was one of the most impactful ransomware cases they had seen. Harms to patient care can extend beyond the blast radius of an incident: one study in the US, for instance, showed that any hospitals physically adjacent to a hospital directly disrupted by a ransomware attack also experienced drops in their quality of patient care. On a broader scale, ransomware operations targeting the healthcare sector can have cascading impacts that undermine the state’s ability to provide or protect healthcare services. In national healthcare systems like the UK’s NHS, single incidents can have systemic effects. In August 2022, for example, a ransomware operation against Advanced, a major NHS IT provider, caused disruption to NHS services that lasted for months, degrading the quality of patient care and increasing the workload of administrative and medical staff who were already under strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of ransomware on educational institutions also has societal implications. Although the UK government does not currently designate education as part of the country’s CNI, it plays an essential role in maintaining the development of a well-functioning society. Ransomware operations targeting the sector have grown in frequency, with one ransomware threat actor, Vice Society, seemingly deliberately targeting schools and universities. Although none of the interviewees from the education sector believed that the incidents involving their schools or universities caused lasting harm to students’ education or outcomes, such attacks create significant recovery costs for victims, and are often timed to coincide with the beginning of the school or academic year so as to maximise disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the immediate impact on the quality of life, wellbeing and development of citizens, ransomware operations against basic services also create significant opportunity costs and diversion of resources away from other priorities. Although these impacts also affect other organisations affected by ransomware, these types of harms, when inflicted on providers of public services, have societal implications. In the UK, ransomware attacks involving the NHS, state education or local authorities take place within a broader context of acute public spending constraints. At the time of writing, for instance, Hackney Council had spent £12.2 million on recovering from the attack in 2020, having previously experienced nearly a decade of some of the highest budget cuts in the country. One interviewee from a UK local authority described how their council had been forced to use up most of its reserves to recover from an attack, diverting resources from other pressing issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the prevalence of ransomware has the potential to undermine trust in the state. The workshops and interviews highlighted the low level of confidence that many victims and ransomware response providers have in the ability of the UK government (or law enforcement) to protect UK organisations or disrupt ransomware threat actors. If citizens perceive the security of public services and data as being in doubt, they may lose confidence in the ability of law enforcement and government to protect them. One recent study of a ransomware attack against a hospital in Düsseldorf, Germany observed a sharp reduction in the local population’s trust in the government and security agencies after the attack. At present, though, there is little evidence that ransomware specifically has caused the UK public to lose trust in the NCSC or in law enforcement, although this could change if there were to be a significant attack against CNI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is often challenging to directly link specific developments to a ransomware attack or to put a number on the financial cost of third-order societal harm caused by such attacks, the interview data has illustrated repeatedly that the harm caused by ransomware attacks has implications for wider society and national security, be it due to the interplay of cyber-criminals and state actors, or to the cumulative effects of ransomware harms on individuals, organisations, the economy and society at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-implications-for-policy-and-future-research&quot;&gt;III. Implications for Policy and Future Research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has described the wide range of harms that ransomware attacks can cause and has provided examples of how victims – organisations as well as individuals – and countries experience these harms. In doing so, it starts to fill the knowledge gaps surrounding the ways ransomware causes harm to organisations, individuals and the UK as a whole. Deeper knowledge of these vectors of harm is critical to designing better responses to the ransomware threat and mitigating harm to victims. Several key findings from the research are important for pushing forward ransomware policy and future research. The next paper from this project will provide recommendations on how to mitigate some of the challenges laid out below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-there-is-generally-a-low-level-of-understanding-of-the-long-term-economic-impact-of-ransomware-attacks&quot;&gt;1. There is generally a low level of understanding of the long-term economic impact of ransomware attacks.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, there are ongoing efforts within the UK government to calculate the economic impact of ransomware on the UK. Mobilising political will, prioritising intelligence and law enforcement resources, and building industry support for combating ransomware are to some extent all predicated on a clear costing of the harm being done to businesses and the UK economy. This paper has highlighted the wide range of costs, losses and downstream economic harms that must be included in any effort to calculate the economic impact of ransomware on the UK, but also the numerous challenges in doing so. For example, the costs of psychological harm caused to victims (impacting their productivity) and the long-term costs that might arise from additional staff turnover do not seem to be captured in interviewees’ financial assessments, which focus predominantly on immediate costs – especially those that are recoverable via insurance. Including long-term and indirect costs, although methodologically challenging, would paint a more accurate picture of the true financial harm caused by ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these reporting challenges for governments and law enforcement, there is little evidence that victims or ransomware response services are collecting data on the full range of financial costs and losses from ransomware. This is partly due to the methodologically challenging nature of this task, but such data gathering is also hampered by the fact that many victims may not be resourced to assess the impact of incidents on their finances; moreover, victims sometimes have very little interest in dwelling on incidents. A number of interviewees highlighted that their organisation wanted to “move on” in the aftermath of a ransomware attack, with little desire to measure or quantify long-term financial harms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as victims are unlikely to have a comprehensive understanding of the financial harm inflicted, no stakeholder in the ransomware ecosystem possesses the long-term insights or general overview that would make possible an assessment of the wider economic harm. The other parties in the ecosystem (for instance, incident responders, insurers, legal counsel, law enforcement and regulators) only have limited insights into specific aspects of the financial harms and are therefore unable to collate all the information that is needed to make a comprehensive assessment of long-term financial harm. Likewise, it is unlikely that any other party would feel it was their responsibility to take on such a burdensome task. Consequently, it is unlikely that we will attain a comprehensive picture of long-term financial harm in the near future, meaning that the current figures probably underestimate the level of financial harm, since they are unlikely to have taken into account other forms of indirect additional costs or financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-reputational-harm-is-a-major-concern-for-organisations-but-may-be-overestimated-by-victims-in-some-contexts&quot;&gt;2. Reputational harm is a major concern for organisations, but may be overestimated by victims in some contexts.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the interview data confirmed that victims have a considerable fear of reputational harm, and that this often guides their response to incidents, the actual degree of reputational harm stemming specifically from data theft/exposure is not always as significant as imagined. Customers and clients can be forgiving, potentially indicating a wider societal acceptance that cyber security breaches cannot always be prevented. However, poor communication practices, both internally and externally, may have significant reputational consequences, as may the risk of data exfiltration. Reputational harm is also to some extent business- and sector-specific, and tightly interconnected with financial harm. Businesses that rely on continuous operations or that hold particularly sensitive information are more susceptible to reputational harm, which can lead directly to financial harm. Public sector organisations, on the other hand, are less exposed to reputational harm given that they often have a monopoly on the provision of basic services and that their funding is less dependent on reputational standing. While reputational harm should not be overlooked, the fact that such harm is often not as serious as some victims fear has important implications for organisations which believe that, in order to protect their reputation, they need to pay ransoms so that ransomware threat actors will delete stolen data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-there-is-currently-little-evidence-that-exfiltrated-data-is-systematically-exploited-for-further-criminal-activities&quot;&gt;3. There is currently little evidence that exfiltrated data is systematically exploited for further criminal activities.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is wider concern about the potential for leaked data obtained in ransomware attacks to be exploited for fraud or other criminal activity, we have not found evidence that the ransomware ecosystem is exploiting stolen and leaked data in a systematic way. For the time being, exploiting stolen data is less profitable than extortion-based crime. While developments in cybercrime (particularly the skills and methods of large-scale data analysis) are likely to impact criminal practices in the future – with criminals potentially revisiting previously exploited data – our research indicates that such data is currently not being systematically exploited for criminal gains. This finding has implications for victims who believe they should pay ransoms to mitigate some of the risk from stolen and exfiltrated personal data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-psychological-harm-to-staff-and-individuals-is-significantly-overlooked-both-in-public-discourse-and-in-organisational-responses-to-ransomware-attacks&quot;&gt;4. Psychological harm to staff and individuals is significantly overlooked, both in public discourse and in organisational responses to ransomware attacks.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the fear of reputational harm among victims is perhaps overstated in many instances, the opposite is true with regard to the psychological impacts of ransomware attacks, which are relatively neglected. Interviews highlighted that the psychological harm to staff is significantly overlooked, both in wider reporting and in organisational responses to ransomware attacks. Interviewees also repeatedly stressed that IT teams in particular suffer the psychological impacts of ransomware attacks. To reduce the harm caused by ransomware attacks, addressing the psychological impact on staff (and other individuals) needs to be at the centre of responses to a ransomware incident. This would involve not only raising awareness of potential psychological harm, but also ensuring that crisis management best practices focus on mitigating psychological harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-the-second--and-third-order-harms-from-ransomware-attacks-disproportionately-affect-vulnerable-groups&quot;&gt;5. The second- and third-order harms from ransomware attacks disproportionately affect vulnerable groups.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware attacks start by harming technology and organisations, but ultimately lead to harm to individuals. However, the effects on individuals are not felt equally. As noted above, within organisations, certain members of staff will likely experience more harm than others. Similarly, the external, downstream effects of ransomware may affect certain groups disproportionately. This is underlined by the impact that attacks on schools, hospitals, law firms that hold sensitive data, and local government services, have on vulnerable groups such as schoolchildren, healthcare patients and residents who rely on benefits or social care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-government-responses-to-ransomware-must-focus-more-on-highlighting-and-reducing-societal-harms-rather-than-focusing-solely-on-economic-harms&quot;&gt;6. Government responses to ransomware must focus more on highlighting and reducing societal harms, rather than focusing solely on economic harms.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By targeting essential public services and other forms of CNI, ransomware harms the physical and mental health, development and prosperity of UK citizens. However, the enduring focus on the financial costs of ransomware risks making wider societal impacts seem abstract and unrelatable to policymakers and the public. In the simplest terms, ransomware has the potential to ruin lives. More openness and clarity about the impact of ransomware on society may help to galvanise efforts, boost resources and increase the political will to find solutions. People – whether politicians or individual citizens – might be more likely to publicly categorise the cumulative effect of ransomware as a societal or national security risk if they knew that many cyber-criminals, some harboured by hostile states, regularly disrupt the services that are an essential part of modern society such as GP appointments, schools, and having rubbish bins collected by local councils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has underlined how impactful ransomware is upon individuals, organisations and wider society. Different forms of harm are felt by a wide range of individuals and groups, who are impacted directly or indirectly. To foster a better understanding of the necessity and nature of policy interventions, it is vital that policymakers understand the scale and breadth of ransomware harms. While ransomware crime is an intractable contemporary issue with no immediate solution, action, where it is applied, should seek to increase resilience and alleviate harms. Greater attention urgently needs to be paid to the human impact of ransomware attacks, be it the psychological harm often overlooked in the wider discourse or the fact that vulnerable groups such as patients and benefits recipients are disproportionately impacted by ransomware harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware attacks remain a threat to individuals and organisations across the UK and indeed the globe. While the wider focus of reporting is often on the financial implications of ransomware attacks, this paper has set out a detailed analysis of different kinds of harm experienced directly or indirectly by ransomware victims and by society at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interview data has suggested a framework including first-, second- and third-order harms to assist in distinguishing between those directly impacted by ransomware, those indirectly impacted, and the cumulative effect ransomware has on society at large. Within each order of harm, this paper identified several categories of harm, such as financial, psychological or reputational harm, and provided numerous examples of how such harm is experienced by victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key findings based on this research underline that the psychological impact of ransomware attacks is significantly overlooked, and that currently no-one has a full understanding of the economic impact of ransomware attacks, such that the cost of the long-term and indirect financial harms is likely to be missing from current estimates of the economic harm caused by ransomware attacks. While the reputational harm stemming from a ransomware attack is a valid concern for some companies, especially those whose clients expect a higher level of privacy (such as customers of legal or financial services), the danger of reputational harm is often overestimated by victims. Similarly, the feared impact of exfiltrated data being used to cause further harm through financial fraud or other crime was not confirmed by interviewees. Instead, interview data showed that groups that are already vulnerable, such as benefits recipients or healthcare patients, are disproportionately impacted by ransomware harm. Finally, the paper found that government responses to ransomware attacks must focus on preventing societal harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper’s detailed account of the ways in which ransomware attacks negatively impact individuals, organisations and society offers new insights into the actual harm caused by ransomware attacks. Although naturally limited, given that it reflects interview data and contemporary criminal activities that must be expected to evolve, the framework proposed in this paper will allow policymakers and practitioners – as well as those preparing for a potential cyber incident – to understand the ways in which victims are negatively impacted by ransomware attacks. This knowledge provides a critical baseline understanding for taking effective steps to mitigate such harm, both when responding or preparing for individual instances but also when designing policy interventions to tackle the ransomware threat. The framework further offers a valuable starting point for future analysis and data gathering, as findings from further research can be incorporated into the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

To cover this gap, the United States and its partners need to explore a variety of promising technologies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report aims to help the defense industry and governments identify future capabilities to deal with the rising challenge from China. The AUKUS agreement has been a major development in facing this challenge, but insights here apply to the full spectrum of U.S. allies and partners in the Pacific. Although strategists seek to expand the number of submarines, the U.S. submarine fleet will not grow beyond its current size until the 2040s. Thus, the project studies wargames and the war in Ukraine to identify ways for the United States and its partners to manage this submarine gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-challenge-ahead&quot;&gt;The Challenge Ahead&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for action is clear. China’s military buildup is well documented and continuing. Its fleet now outnumbers the U.S. Navy, and its ground-based missile force is massive. The United States has many partners and allies in the region, but the lack of an integrating structure like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) means that any coalition responding to Chinese aggression must be developed bilaterally. This requires U.S. presence and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AUKUS agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States represents a major development in the Western Pacific. Pillar 1 of the agreement will develop an Australian nuclear submarine capability and enhance U.S. submarine presence in Australia. Pillar 2 seeks to share emerging technologies across the three countries. The insights of this report relate particularly to Pillar 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategists inside and outside of government see submarines as a key capability in a conflict with China because of the stealth and firepower of these platforms. They have proposed U.S. submarine fleets ranging in size from 66 to 78 vessels, compared to the current fleet of 53. However, the U.S. submarine fleet will decline through the 2020s due to a lack of submarine construction in the 1990s, reaching a low of 46 in 2030 before rebuilding and returning to the current level in the late 2030s. Fleet levels after that are highly speculative, but even under optimistic circumstances, the submarine fleet will not reach the size targeted by strategists until the 2040s or beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;filling-the-gap&quot;&gt;Filling the Gap&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should the United States and its partners do to manage the impending gap in submarine numbers over the coming decades?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wargames of a Chinese invasion, blockade, or gray zone squeeze of Taiwan illuminate capabilities that would be helpful. Early assessments of the war in Ukraine give additional insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following provides a thematic menu of possibilities. Some are available in the near term, while others are possible in the longer term. Not all will work out, but many could evolve into programs of record that would balance China’s military buildup, enhance deterrence, and strengthen warfighting if deterrence fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make existing submarines more effective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Large uncrewed underwater vessels (UUVs) can operate autonomously inside the Chinese defensive zone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium UUVs can extend the reach of individual submarines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhanced submarine maintenance would increase the number of operational submarines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring more forces to bear more effectively:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deployable command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I) packages would allow U.S. forces to link more effectively with allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contractors can expand coalition training without diverting military personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operational contracting can supplement limited military logistics units in providing the logistics needed to cover the vast expanses of the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan to operate in a hostile environment:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dispersed aircraft basing complicates Chinese targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building hardened aircraft shelters would protect aircraft remaining at large bases during conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stronger surface ship defenses would allow operations deeper inside the Chinese defensive zone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assisting Taiwan in developing a balanced force with both traditional and asymmetric capabilities would hedge against the spectrum of threats it faces, from gray zone harassment to invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sustaining efforts to build resilience against cyberattacks would help prevent such attacks from having an operational or strategic effect even if they cannot be fully thwarted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Backup systems for communications and geolocation would provide a hedge against jamming and GPS spoofing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Peacetime preparations can enhance wartime operations in an environment where logistics are contested.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hedge against unconventional threats:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stronger countermine capabilities, long neglected by the U.S. Navy, would protect against a common adversary tactic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Counter-swarming capabilities would allow military and civilian ships to continue operations without resorting to lethal force against harassing elements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uncrewed aerial systems (UASs) could be used to harass Chinese harassers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defend against air threats in all their manifestations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upgraded defenses against cruise and ballistic missiles would protect forces against an expanding and constantly evolving threat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expanding and fielding systems to counter adversary UASs would protect friendly forces from adversary reconnaissance and attack amid the ubiquity of such systems on the battlefield, and defensive systems against aircraft are generally too expensive for this use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think offensively, even when on the defensive:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhanced jamming and counter-C3I would disrupt China’s ability to coordinate forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) can extend the awareness and reach of crewed vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UASs can perform missions that are too dangerous, extended, or monotonous for crewed platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hypersonic missiles, even if niche weapons, can contribute to campaigns by attacking high-value, well-defended targets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sea mines with standoff capabilities can emplace minefields with less risk to the launch platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report does not make recommendations on which of these capabilities to pursue. That requires an in-depth analysis of each capability’s cost, technological maturity, operational effectiveness, and political acceptability. The report does recommend moving forward across many possibilities to illuminate the most promising approaches and to provide signals to industry about where it should focus its attention and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-this-study&quot;&gt;Why This Study?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pacific security has been at the top of the national security agenda since at least 2014, when the Obama administration announced an end to the United States’ focus on counterinsurgency and regional stability and laid out five challenges: Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and global terrorism. China was challenge number two after Russia, which had just occupied Crimea. The Trump administration continued this framework, clearly articulated a new focus on great power conflict, and moved China to the top position ahead of Russia. The Biden administration has essentially continued this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most dramatic recent event in this space has been the signing of the AUKUS agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States to develop a nuclear-powered Australian submarine fleet and share key technologies. The challenge from China and the AUKUS response has spawned a wide variety of analyses. This study adds to that body of research by focusing on one key question: What promising technologies are available in the near and mid-term to enhance capabilities while the United States and its partners wait for this expanded submarine force to arrive? The report aims to help industry work with governments to pursue these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report does not claim to be a comprehensive analysis of what is needed to compete against China. That would include new operational concepts, force posture, force readiness, force size and structure, relations with partners and allies, and budget — all important topics but beyond the scope of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this short introduction, the report is organized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2 examines today’s security environment in the Western Pacific, including a brief overview of the challenge from China, U.S. alliances and partnerships in the region, and finally the AUKUS agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 3 describes what wargames and campaign analyses say about potentially useful capabilities. The chapter concludes with insights from the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 4 analyzes the U.S. submarine fleet and the submarine industrial base. It concludes that while additional submarines would provide critical capabilities, the U.S. submarine fleet will decline through the mid-2030s. Therefore, enhanced near and midterm capabilities will need to come from elsewhere to meet China’s rising military challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Chapter 5 pulls all these threads together. It identifies capabilities that should be expanded, technological areas for exploration, and some services that the defense industry might provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;todays-security-environment-in-the-western-pacific&quot;&gt;Today’s Security Environment in the Western Pacific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;China’s Challenge, U.S. Alliances, and AUKUS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter sets the stage by exploring three key elements of today’s security environment in the Western Pacific: the China challenge, U.S. alliances and partnerships, and the AUKUS agreement. These shape the military requirements the United States, Australia, and other partners must meet to compete in this environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-challenge&quot;&gt;China’s Challenge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is commonplace to note how China has become increasingly assertive diplomatically and politically, backed by a massive military expansion. This assertiveness arises from China’s view of itself as an alternative to the U.S.-led international system based on free markets and democratic values. As a result, the Biden administration’s National Security Strategy identifies China as the primary global competitor to the United States: “The PRC is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it. Beijing has ambitions to create an enhanced sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific and to become the world’s leading power.” In response, Congress has taken several legislative actions, from bolstering U.S. semiconductor manufacturing via the CHIPS Act of 2022 to cutting off U.S. funding from Chinese entities that abuse human rights via the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act of 2021. The House of Representatives has created a committee focused on China: the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To implement its new strategic vision, China began a long-term military modernization program in the late 1990s, focusing particularly on air and maritime capabilities. This was a change from China’s previous military strategy, which was land-focused, relied on masses of poorly trained conscripts, and could not exert influence at a distance from its borders. Its poor performance in the 1979 border war with Vietnam underscored its weakness, as did the 1996 transit of the Taiwan Strait by U.S. naval forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has changed. As the Department of Defense (DOD)’s annual assessment of Chinese military power notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 2022, the PRC turned to the PLA [People’s Liberation Army] as an increasingly capable instrument of statecraft. Throughout the year, the PLA adopted more coercive actions in the Indo-Pacific region while accelerating its development of capabilities and concepts to strengthen the PRC’s ability to “fight and win wars” against a “strong enemy,” counter an intervention by a third party in a conflict along the PRC’s periphery, and to project power globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NeJQJ5O.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Map 1: Taiwan and Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD report also documents the continuing expansion of the Chinese military. The Chinese navy — the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) — grew from 216 ships in 2005 to 351 ships in 2022, making it nearly 60 ships larger than the U.S. Navy. China’s nuclear modernization has accelerated, growing from 300 to 500 nuclear warheads, “exceed[ing] some of our [DOD’s] previous expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This military buildup and assertive diplomacy — characterized in China as a “wolf warrior” attitude — pose challenges to countries in the region. Three challenges — to Taiwan, Japan, and the South China Sea region — are particularly important:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan:&lt;/strong&gt; China has been emphatic that Taiwan is a part of greater China. It therefore regards Taiwan as a renegade province, not an independent or autonomous entity. China has also been clear about its intention to reunite Taiwan with the mainland and that it will not renounce the use of force to achieve reunification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japan:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan and China have a long history of conflict, from the Mongol invasions of the thirteenth century to the Japanese invasion of China in the 1930s and 1940s. Recently, those tensions have focused on the Senkaku Islands (called the Diaoyu Islands by China), which both nations claim. China has sailed warships near Japan and fired missiles into Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone. Japan also has concerns about China’s client, North Korea, which has launched missiles over Japan and regularly threatens nuclear holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South China Sea region:&lt;/strong&gt; Although recent attention has focused on Taiwan, the South China Sea is also a region of intense competition. The region is important because of the high level of seaborne traffic and large oil and gas deposits. China’s infamous “nine-dash line,” by which China seeks to claim most of the South China Sea, exacerbates regional tensions. These claims have put China in competition with the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan, which also have territorial claims. China has been aggressive in asserting its claims, including by building and fortifying artificial islands in the region, demanding that ships and aircraft recognize an expanded Chinese identification zone, and harassing the ships of other nations. Such tactics were seen recently as China endeavored to prevent the Philippines from resupplying a garrison in the Second Thomas Shoals. The United States does not take a position on territorial claims but regularly conducts freedom of navigation operations in the region, to which China strongly objects&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Admiral Philip S. Davidson, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) until April 2021, testified the same year that the Chinese threat to invade Taiwan “is manifest . . . in the next six years.” . . . The notion of a “Davidson window” has thus entered the national security vocabulary.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3IMre4s.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alliances-and-partnerships&quot;&gt;Alliances and Partnerships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has a strong set of Pacific alliances with a variety of wealthy, powerful, and strategically located nations. In addition, the United States has less formal security links to many other countries. However, all these relationships are bilateral, not united through a common structure like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). As a result, nations will react individually to any crisis. Such ally countries include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Australia:&lt;/strong&gt; The Australia, New Zealand, and United States Security Treaty (ANZUS Treaty) binds the United States, Australia, and New Zealand to meet common dangers together, and the countries have a long security relationship, having fought side by side in six wars: World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, and Iraq. The relationship has become closer with the AUKUS agreement (discussed later) and regular rotations of U.S. aircraft and Marines to bases in northern Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;China has attempted to squeeze Australia economically to make Australia’s policies more China friendly. For example, in 2020, after Canberra questioned the origins of Covid-19, China imposed restrictions on the import of Australian beef, wine, and other commodities. This alerted Australia to the dangers that China posed. In a 2022 event held at CSIS, Australian deputy prime minister and defense minister Richard Marles noted, “For the first time in decades, we are thinking hard about the security of our own strategic geography; the viability of our trade and supply routes; and above all the preservation of an inclusive regional order founded on rules agreed by all, not the coercive capabilities of a few.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Australia is a strong democracy with high-quality armed forces. As Australia’s 2023 Defence Strategic Review states, a close relationship with the United States has ensured that, since the 1960s, “While small in size, the ADF [Australian Defense Force] was [is] highly capable and could outmatch potential regional opponents in critical areas of technology, planning, and operations.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The downside is that Australia’s armed forces are relatively small, and Australia is far from some potential conflict zones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japan:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Japan are bound through the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security of 1960. This authorizes the United States to station troops in Japan and obligates the parties to defend each other if either is attacked on the territories administered by Japan. This alliance is particularly important because 53,600 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan, about half on Okinawa. The Japanese constitution allows the country to maintain only self-defense forces as a result of the country’s defeat in World War II; indeed, its military is called the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force. For decades, Japanese governments have defined self-defense as 1 percent of GDP and focused on defensive weapons. However, in response to China’s aggressiveness, Japan has made plans to acquire more offensive weapons, increase its defense budget above the traditional 1 percent, and conduct exercises aimed at China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Korea:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and South Korea are bound through the 1953 Mutual Defense Treaty. As a result of the Korean War of 1950 to 1953, the United States still has 24,300 troops stationed in the country and a joint military command with the South Korean armed forces. The Mutual Defense Treaty obligates the parties to defend each other if either is attacked in the Pacific on territories under their administrative control. South Korea has powerful armed forces, but they are designed for national defense. Although South Korea sent combat troops to Vietnam and peacekeepers to Afghanistan, the willingness of the South Koreans to participate in conflict outside of the Korean Peninsula is unclear. South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol has strengthened ties with the United States and other regional partners such as Japan and has been willing to criticize China. However, he has stated that in the event of a U.S. conflict with China, South Korea would keep its forces at home to deter any aggression by North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Philippines:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and the Philippines are linked through the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty and a long history of mutual security arrangements dating back to when the Philippines was a U.S. colony. Although the United States has provided equipment and training over the years, the Philippine armed forces are relatively limited, being equipped with older equipment. A major recent development is a set of agreements by which the Philippines granted the United States access to nine bases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thailand:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Thailand are bound to defend each other’s territory in the Asia-Pacific by the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty of 1954. As a result, the countries conduct regular military exercises together. However, Thailand’s military forces are weak, as are its democratic institutions. This limits the strength of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to formal alliances, the United States has security relationships with several countries in the region:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan:&lt;/strong&gt; Although the United States has no formal security agreement with Taiwan, the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 states, “Any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes is considered a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States.” For decades, U.S. policy has been governed by “strategic ambiguity” regarding how the United States would react to any Chinese attack on Taiwan. However, Congress and President Biden have recently indicated that the United States would defend Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Singapore:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Singapore have an agreement that allows U.S. access to port facilities in the city-state but are not formal allies. Singapore’s legendary founder, Lee Kuan Yew, established this relationship after the United Kingdom withdrew from Asia in the 1960s, and it has since been a central element of Singapore’s security architecture. However, that close relationship has faded somewhat since Lee’s death in 2015, and most Singaporeans now view China more positively than the United States. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has stated that Singapore does not want to choose sides in a U.S.-China war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India:&lt;/strong&gt; India is a major military power with nuclear weapons and 1,460,000 personnel on active duty in its armed forces. It is also intensely independent, being one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement. It resists the establishment of formal alliances. However, increased tensions with China have compelled India to augment security ties with partners, including the United States, Australia, and Japan. India has been incrementally diversifying its defense imports away from Russia while attempting to jump-start a stronger indigenous defense manufacturing base.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vietnam:&lt;/strong&gt; Once bitter enemies, Vietnam and the United States have been pushed together by mutual concerns about China. China is Vietnam’s traditional enemy, having occupied the country at various times in the past and most recently having fought a border war in 1979. Although Vietnam has large ground forces — its army numbers 412,000 personnel — its air and naval forces are limited, and it is overshadowed militarily by China. Therefore, Vietnam is unlikely to participate in a U.S.-China conflict unless attacked directly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that the United States will be able to draw on support from many other countries in the event of a crisis or a conflict. However, the amount and nature of the support will depend on the circumstances. Further, any action will require U.S. leadership since all these relationships are bilateral. There is no substitute for U.S. forces and presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aukus&quot;&gt;AUKUS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AUKUS is a defense collaboration between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States that was initially announced in September 2021. A joint report followed from defense industry associations in the three countries. In March 2023, the three countries signed a trilateral agreement describing how AUKUS would be operationalized. The agreement aims to “boost defense capabilities, accelerate technological integration, and expand the industrial capacity of all three nations.” On December 2, 2023, the AUKUS defense ministers met, reaffirmed the three nations’ commitment to the program, and elaborated on implementation plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Any action will require U.S. leadership since all these relationships are bilateral. There is no substitute for U.S. forces and presence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AUKUS has two pillars. Pillar 1 will assist Australia in acquiring conventionally armed nuclear attack submarines (SSNs). Under the agreement, the United States will sell Australia three to five Virginia-class submarines in the early 2030s. The United States will also base a submarine rotational force in western Australia as early as 2027. Starting in 2032, the United Kingdom and Australia will co-develop a new nuclear-powered submarine class to enter service in the late 2030s, with initial production in the UK and later production in Australia. The three nations will cooperate to build a stronger trilateral submarine industrial base. The additional submarine capacity will increase Australia’s ability to defend its sea routes from Chinese interference. The United Kingdom has recently signed contracts for £4 billion ($5 billion) to develop the new submarine design. In addition to submarine construction, Pillar 1 calls for rotating U.S. submarines to Australia’s west coast and enhanced basing there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AUKUS Pillar 2 seeks to enhance cooperation in key technological and functional areas. Eight intragovernmental working groups coordinate Pillar 2 activities: undersea capabilities, quantum technologies, artificial intelligence and autonomy, advanced cyber, hypersonic and counter-hypersonic capabilities, electronic warfare, innovation, and information sharing. The defense ministers identified six capability areas for cooperation (anti-submarine warfare, undersea vehicle launch and recovery, quantum positioning, navigation, and timing, and resilient and autonomous artificial intelligence. The defense ministers also specified a variety of processes and structures for coordinating capability development and conducting experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pillar 2 activities are expected to help fill the partnership’s capability gaps in the decades before Pillar 1’s SSN procurement activities take effect. A recent technology readiness experiment (dubbed T-REX 23-2) moved Pillar 2 forward by evaluating 11 advanced technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement has received tremendous fanfare and has the potential for unprecedented military and industrial cooperation among the participants. The deal is particularly important to Australia, as AUKUS is one of the largest military projects the country has ever undertaken. However, as one U.S. official described it, AUKUS will remain a promise rather than a reality for many years. It has great future potential but involves modest steps in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-war-and-wargames-say-about-conflict-in-the-western-pacific&quot;&gt;What War and Wargames Say about Conflict in the Western Pacific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three potential conflicts in the Western Pacific are particularly important to examine because of their plausibility, potential severity, and relevance to AUKUS commitments. The first is a full-scale conventional war between China and a U.S.-led coalition. The second is a blockade of Taiwan. The third is Chinese gray zone activities, particularly in the South China Sea. Collectively, these describe the broad set of military demands that would be put on the United States and its partners and that AUKUS needs to hedge against. Wargames and associated analyses can illuminate the nature of such conflicts and the military requirements that flow from them. A real war — the Russian invasion of Ukraine — provides additional insights. Many other potential conflicts, such as North Korean aggression, constitute serious threats but are less relevant to the AUKUS agreement and competition with China because the conflict would be relatively low-tech (except for missiles and nuclear weapons) and mainly on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-invasion-of-taiwan&quot;&gt;Chinese Invasion of Taiwan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in the first chapter, China has been unrelenting in its goal of uniting Taiwan with the mainland. A Chinese military invasion of Taiwan may not be the most likely course of action to accomplish this goal. However, given China’s rhetoric and military buildup, an invasion is plausible and the most dangerous Chinese course of action. Several Taiwan-focused wargames warrant consideration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSIS Wargame:&lt;/strong&gt; For the reasons described above, CSIS conducted a project that examined Taiwan invasion scenarios. The project developed a wargame and ran 25 iterations in a dozen scenarios. Because the wargame was based entirely on unclassified information, the project could describe the assumptions, mechanics, and results in detail. Several findings bear on requirements for future capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Submarines were highly lethal. Whereas surface ships had to pull back in the face of the Chinese anti-ship missile threat, submarines could push into the Chinese defensive bubble, often called the anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) zone or weapons engagement zone. Once inside the Taiwan Strait, they rapidly exhausted their inventories of missiles and torpedoes against the Chinese invasion fleet. Indeed, the project dubbed this the “happy time” for U.S. submarines.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Their ability to strike the Chinese center of gravity, the amphibious ships, made them particularly valuable. However, once submarines expended their munitions, they had to travel to either Sasebo or Guam to reload before returning to the fight. This conveyor belt — strike, return to base, reload, transit back to the war zone, strike again — was effective but slow. U.S. players always wanted more submarines.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bombers were survivable and highly effective. They could be based outside of Chinese missile range, thus avoiding attack on the ground. Armed with long-range missiles, bombers could launch from outside of the Chinese air defense zone and strike ground and naval targets at relatively low risk.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, long-range anti-ship munitions were too few. The United States ran out of these munitions after just a few days. Their long range was critical, allowing U.S. aircraft to launch from outside of the range of Chinese air defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;U.S. fighter/attack aircraft were most vulnerable on the ground. About 90 percent of U.S. and coalition aircraft losses occurred on the ground to Chinese missile strikes. The Chinese have enough long-range missiles to saturate U.S. bases several times over the course of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hypersonic missiles were valuable but niche weapons. They were extremely effective in striking high-value defended targets. However, their high cost limits inventories, so they lack the volume needed to counter the immense numbers of Chinese air and naval platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Surface ships were highly vulnerable to Chinese missile attacks. As long as China retained substantial long-range missile inventories, U.S. and coalition surface ships had to back off to the east of Guam. It was too dangerous for them to remain within range of Chinese anti-ship missiles. Once China’s missile inventories declined as they repeatedly struck land targets such as air bases, the surface ships could move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s surface ships and aircraft struggled to survive. These traditional capabilities are valuable in day-to-day operations to counter Chinese harassment and encroachment but are highly vulnerable to the massive and growing Chinese navy and air force in a major conflict. Most Taiwanese surface ships and aircraft were destroyed in the first few days. The balanced force structure that served Taiwan so well from 1949 needs re-examination, a discussion that is already taking place as Taiwanese national security literature considers a “porcupine strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNAS Wargames:&lt;/strong&gt; The Center for New American Security (CNAS) has run several wargames on a U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan. These wargames arrived at conclusions similar to those of the CSIS wargame, with several additional insights:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The United States has insufficient supporting forces. It also lacks enough access to partner or allied bases across the Indo-Pacific to sufficiently disperse its forces to survive initial attacks and blunt China’s initial strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The United States needs a greater emphasis on conducting logistics in a contested environment so that it can sustain combat power beyond the first days or weeks of a war.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;China is likely to engage in nuclear brinkmanship despite its stated “no first use” policy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taiwan requires improved training for its armed forces, especially its reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taiwan is highly dependent on imports of critical supplies and should stockpile these resources in advance of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Several critical capabilities are needed, including long-range precision-guided weapons, undersea capabilities such as uncrewed underwater vessels (UUVs), and improved passive and active base defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAND Wargames:&lt;/strong&gt; RAND conducted a series of wargames focused especially on technologies that can be applied in the near term. Although the details have not been released and are apparently classified, some general insights are available. Some particularly useful capabilities were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Multi-domain decoys and smart sea mines, which can disrupt the adversary’s kill chain.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Real-time language translation, which can enhance situational awareness for allies while protecting friendly information.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Integrated warfighting networks, which can make better use of networked devices on the tactical edge.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-blockade-of-taiwan&quot;&gt;Chinese Blockade of Taiwan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many commentators consider a Chinese blockade of Taiwan more likely than an invasion because such an approach is less violent and confrontational. Blockades are different from invasion scenarios because political and diplomatic aspects are often paramount, though military capabilities still have a key role. Therefore, it is worthwhile to examine analyses and wargames about blockades to see which military capabilities might be useful in countering a blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Military Exercises:&lt;/strong&gt; In recent years, China has conducted regular exercises simulating a blockade of Taiwan. Exercise Joint Sword in April 2023 was revealing. Chinese military commentators cited the effort to attain “information agility” whereby China would speed up the kill chain through a “system-of-systems” approach. China also conducted major military exercises in the seas around Taiwan in September 2023, which included practicing sustained carrier-based air operations that would be useful in enforcing a blockade on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSIS Emerging Wargame Results:&lt;/strong&gt; CSIS is beginning a series of wargames and analyses of a Chinese blockade of Taiwan as a follow-on to its First Battle of the Next War invasion analysis. Although this work is still in progress, several emerging insights are worth noting.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sea mines are especially attractive in blockades because of their covertness and persistence. China has many mines and the platforms to employ them. Its doctrine explicitly includes such use.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Missile attacks are part of a blockade strategy. Chinese exercises conducted before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Taiwan visit showed how China might use missiles to impose a blockade.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;China will harass civilian shipping. Although cargo ships are large and imposing, they are risk averse and therefore susceptible to pressure unless provided with mechanisms for resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;China might attack civilian shipping. Cargo ships are highly survivable because of their large size but need protection and incentives to accept the risk of damage or loss.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Several capabilities are needed: sea mines and mine clearance, protection packages for merchant shipping, and missile defense.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAND Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; A 2002 RAND study examined the implications of a blockade of Taiwan. Although the study focused mostly on the political and economic aspects of such an operation, it did note the likelihood of China employing swarming tactics. In such situations, China often uses nonmilitary platforms such as the China Coast Guard, Maritime Militia, or fishing vessels to crowd an adversary ship and prevent it from accomplishing its mission.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Studies:&lt;/strong&gt; In a study published by the China Maritime Studies Institute, former U.S. intelligence officer and East Asia expert Lonnie Henley describes how a blockade might unfold. He notes Taiwan’s maritime vulnerability due to the concentration of its major ports on Taiwan’s west coast, closest to Chinese power. He argues for enhancing mine clearance, developing concepts and technologies for blockade running and convoy operations, and degrading the Chinese integrated air defense system through electronic and kinetic methods.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A Carnegie-sponsored study by Sean Mirski examined the dynamics of a U.S. naval blockade of China. Nevertheless, the study identifies several capabilities that would be needed in the event of a Chinese blockade, particularly sea mines, mine clearance, and maritime domain awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A forthcoming CSIS study on Taiwan blockade scenarios raises the possibility of cyberattacks being part of a Chinese blockade operation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gray-zone-competition-in-the-south-china-sea&quot;&gt;Gray Zone Competition in the South China Sea&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gray zone competition refers to actions short of war that challenge U.S. interests, influence, or power in ways designed to avoid direct U.S. military responses. Although these activities could occur anywhere in the Pacific, the South China Sea is a region of particular attention because of Chinese ambitions, making it a flashpoint for conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, RAND conducted a wargame simulating Chinese gray zone coercion of Taiwan. Their findings highlight the conditions under which a conflict over Taiwan might begin and illuminate which capabilities would be useful to the United States and its allies and partners. Their conclusions include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gray zone coercion is relatively unlikely to escalate to full-blown war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States will consider escalating to military force if Taiwan faces an existential threat, such as a blockade or an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan will not escalate without explicit U.S. support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States is more likely to intervene to support Taiwan if the island takes steps to defend itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several capabilities are needed: air defense, maritime surveillance, and anti-harassment tools.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-real-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;The Real War in Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine is occurring in a different geography than would a war in the Western Pacific. In Ukraine, the ground domain dominates, whereas the air and maritime domains would dominate conflict in the Western Pacific. Nevertheless, the war in Ukraine provides a current example of high-intensity conflict between large and well-equipped adversaries and, therefore, is relevant to all future conflicts. Although it will be many years before the lessons learned from this conflict are fully examined and understood, several important insights relevant to a conflict in the Western Pacific can be discerned now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Importance of Inventories:&lt;/strong&gt; In the post-Cold War period, the United States and its allies assumed that future wars would have a short, high-intensity phase. If there were an extended stabilization phase, it would not put heavy demands on firepower, so inventories of weapons and munitions would not need to be extensive. However, the war in Ukraine has had a fundamentally different character. The continuing demands for weapons and munitions have strained U.S. and coalition inventories, limiting what they can send, as deliveries deplete stockpiles to levels that threaten other global commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Need for Industrial Surge:&lt;/strong&gt; Maintaining full stockpiles of all systems for long wars is impossible because of the high cost. Industrial surge must be able to meet the demands of longer and more intensive wars. However, in the United States and elsewhere, most surge capabilities have been eliminated in the name of efficiency. Production levels were set to produce weapons and munitions efficiently at peacetime rates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Major and Evolving Role of Uncrewed Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukrainian ground forces note the ubiquity of uncrewed aerial systems (UASs) that spot targets for artillery attacks. “Kamikaze” UASs fly into targets, whether personnel or vehicles, acting as a tactical cruise missile. Uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) have attacked Russian ships and driven them from Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Centrality of Connectivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukrainian forces have connected their diverse and expanding forces by using Starlink, a civilian system. They have thus avoided what might have been a major limitation on Ukrainian operations — an inability to communicate rapidly and reliably across geography, organizations, and domains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Power of Electronic Warfare:&lt;/strong&gt; Communications are routinely jammed. GPS spoofers — widely anticipated for many years — are commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The influence of narrative:&lt;/strong&gt; Narrative shaping has been an essential tool for Ukraine to drive political support. It has dominated the information space by reaching out to experts and journalists, sending representatives — including the president — to other countries to make their argument, and ensuring that good news got out while bad news was restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;submarines&quot;&gt;Submarines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Unobtainable Solution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of Chinese threats, the AUKUS agreement, and wargame results, a clear solution would be for the United States to build more submarines. Indeed, a strong submarine force is a feature of nearly every proposed fleet architecture, whether developed by government organizations or outside experts, and is the foundation of AUKUS. However, expanding the submarine fleet in the near or midterm is not possible because of constraints on the submarine industrial base. Indeed, the size of the submarine fleet will drop below the current level through the mid-2030s. Therefore, enhanced near- and midterm capabilities to meet a rising Chinese military challenge will need to come from elsewhere. This chapter lays out the strategic desirability of submarines, the difficulties in building more, and the future size of the submarine fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Support from Strategists:&lt;/strong&gt; Strategists like SSNs because the firepower and covertness of these platforms are useful in great power conflicts. Unlike surface ships, submarines can easily operate inside an adversary’s defensive bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 shows how support for increasing the submarine fleet — including SSNs and guided missile submarines (SSGNs) — has been strong across many different fleet architectures developed by the Navy, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and think tanks. The horizontal line shows the current level of the attack submarine fleet (FY 2024). The vertical bars show the proposed level in the different architectures, all of which are above the current inventory level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/c3jRTk1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Target Inventory for Attack Submarines (SSNs and SSGNs) Compared with Current Fleet.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Fleet architectures as described by the DOD, Navy, and research organizations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Implementation Challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; The problem is getting to these higher goals. The obvious solution would be to build more submarines, but having two submarine construction programs operating simultaneously — for Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) and Virginia-class SSNs — puts pressure on the shipbuilding budget and the submarine industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the president’s proposed FY 2024 defense budget, building two SSNs and one SSBN will cost $16.1 billion in a Navy shipbuilding account that totals $29.5 billion for new construction. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that: “The three alternatives in the Navy’s 2024 plan would require average annual shipbuilding appropriations that were 31 percent to 40 percent more than the average over the past five years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSBNs have the highest priority because of their strategic nuclear role. As Admiral Lisa Franchetti stated in her confirmation hearing, “CLB [the Columbia class] is the Navy’s number one acquisition priority, with no further margin for program delay. The Navy must fully fund CLB to meet U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) requirements for the first patrol no later than October 2030 to replace retiring Ohio-class SSBNs.” Because of this program’s high priority, it will be fully funded, including any cost growth. So far, the Columbia class has not shown large cost growth, but programs of that size and technical complexity often do, and the program has high schedule risk. In October 2022, the Navy estimated that there was a high probability that procurement costs would be greater than what the Navy previously forecast: 54 percent for the first Columbia-class boat (excluding costs for plans) and 49 percent for boats 2 through 12. Attack submarines will have to fight for the remaining shipbuilding funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, only two shipyards build submarines, General Dynamics’ Electric Boat Division (GD/EB) in Groton, CT, and Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding (HII/NNS), in Newport News, VA. The Navy is investing $2.4 billion over the next five years to strengthen the submarine industrial base to handle both programs. The president has proposed another $3.4 billion in his October 2023 Ukraine/Israel supplemental. Nevertheless, the challenge for the industrial base — both shipyards and suppliers — is to ramp up production from one “regular” Virginia-class boat per year (the volume of work before FY 2011) to the equivalent of about five “regular” Virginia-class boats per year (the approximate volume of work represented by two Virginia Payload Module-equipped Virginia-class boats and one Columbia-class boat).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AUKUS agreement, by providing nuclear submarines and nuclear facilities to the Royal Australian Navy, will put additional pressure on the U.S. submarine industrial base even as it strengthens security in the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Shrinking Fleet:&lt;/strong&gt; Figure 2 shows the size of the submarine fleet over time. The dotted horizontal line shows the level of the current fleet (FY 2024).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solid line shows the current plan. In the near term, the size of the attack submarine fleet declines, bottoming out at 46 boats in FY 2030. This decline reflects the low production rates of the 1990s and 2000s, when the strategic focus was on regional conflicts, and the Navy often built only one submarine a year. The large inventory from the Cold War has kept the fleet size high for many years, but those Cold War submarines are now retiring in large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mitigate this trough, the Navy has extended the service life of some older Los Angeles-class submarines. There is unlikely much more that can be done using this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 also shows two alternative futures. One line extends the Navy’s base plan, which builds two SSNs in most years (solid line). Fleet size eventually recovers as new ships join the fleet, reaching the level of today’s submarine fleet in the late 2030s but never rising to the recommended level of most fleet architectures. This plan could change, as it does not incorporate the effects of the 2022 National Defense Strategy; that analysis is still undergoing review. Neither does it include the effects of the AUKUS agreement, which was signed after the projection was developed. Nevertheless, whatever plan emerges next year, the previously described limits on the submarine industrial base will constrain it in the near- and mid-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative (dashed line) assumes that the Navy builds three SSNs per year once production of the Columbia class ends and pressure on the industrial base eases. Under these circumstances, the submarine fleet reaches the target level of many proposed architectures in the late 2040s and the level of the most ambitious plans in the early 2050s. The obstacle to achieving this alternative, higher level of production would be finding the budget space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/odhjc6H.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Projected Attack Submarine Fleet, FY 2023–FY 2053.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Data from Long-Range Naval Inventory tables in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govexec.com/media/navy_2024_shipbuilding_plan.pdf&quot;&gt;Report to Congress on the Annual Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels for Fiscal Year 2024 (Washington, DC: Department of Defense, March 2023)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to give priority to the Columbia-class program and AUKUS, the limits of the industrial base, and the aging of the existing fleet constrain what the Navy can do in the near and midterm to increase the size of the submarine fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, regional allies might help fill the gap, but numbers and capabilities are limited. Taiwan has four old submarines (30+ years), though it has begun construction on a modern class. Australia has six Collins-class submarines, but these are aging and based far from potential conflict areas. Japan has 22 excellent submarines but may not be involved and, if involved, might be unwilling to use its forces offensively. Beyond these countries, the analysis in Chapter 2 indicates that it is unlikely that other allies or partners would be willing to provide military forces to a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, regardless of what strategists may want, the submarine fleet will remain below desired levels for many decades. The challenge is to find other mechanisms to compete in the Western Pacific for the two decades until a larger submarine inventory becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Regardless of what strategists may want, the submarine fleet will remain below desired levels for many decades.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;filling-the-gaps&quot;&gt;Filling the Gaps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What to Do until More Submarines Arrive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AUKUS offers a powerful mechanism for enhancing U.S. and partner security interests in the Western Pacific. A coalition submarine fleet with increased numbers, wider basing, and more diversified capabilities will enhance deterrence and strengthen warfighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since additional submarines will not be available for many years, the United States and its partners need to take other measures. Pillar 2 of AUKUS offers a mechanism with its focus on technological cooperation. Beyond AUKUS, the United States has many other relationships in the Western Pacific that would benefit from an expanded menu of capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threats described in Chapter 2 and the wargame results described in Chapter 3 suggest several potentially useful capabilities, which are described below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;making-existing-submarines-more-effective&quot;&gt;Making Existing Submarines More Effective&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the size of the submarine fleet will decline through the 2020s, there is a need to increase the effectiveness of the submarines that are available. Two items come up repeatedly in wargames and the warfighting literature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncrewed Underwater Vehicles:&lt;/strong&gt; The Navy is investigating a range of UUVs, from the very small to the very large. The Navy envisions UUVs being a force multiplier for their motherships, which will not decrease in numbers. Two kinds have promise for enhancing the effectiveness of existing submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On the high end, there is the Orca, 50 tons and the size of a bus. The Orca, the only Extra-Large UUV (XLUUV) program, will initially provide a minelaying capability, with the platform deploying the planned Hammerhead mine. This mine would be tethered to the seabed and armed with an antisubmarine torpedo, similar to the Navy’s Cold War-era CAPTOR antisubmarine mine. Although six prototype Orcas are being built, they are still experimental and not a program of record.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Medium UUVs (MUUVs) are systems with a diameter larger than 10 inches but less than 21 inches, allowing torpedo tube deployment. The two primary MUUV missions are intelligence gathering (“Intelligence Preparation of the Operational Environment”) and mine countermeasures. By deploying from a submarine, they can respond rapidly to a tactical situation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A recent trilateral exercise by the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia — Technology Readiness Experimentation, or T-REX 23-2 — tested some of these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;CSIS’s working group of outside experts noted that UUVs were attractive because of their stealth, but also that command and control underwater was extremely difficult. It represented a technological challenge that industry needs to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Submarine Maintenance:&lt;/strong&gt; What matters ultimately is not how many submarines a fleet has but how many submarines it can deploy. U.S. submarine availability has been low because of maintenance backlogs. In recent years, availability has run about 60 percent; that figure is up to 64–67 percent now, and the Navy hopes to get it up to 80 percent. Extended shipyard maintenance periods for submarines contribute to this low availability rate. From FY 2015 to FY 2019, only 5 of 33 submarine maintenance periods were completed on time, with a total of 6,296 days (about 17 years) lost to maintenance delay. Across the fleet, the difference between 60 percent and 80 percent availability is 10 boats that should be sailing the seas but are instead sitting in shipyards. The budget supplemental proposed in October 2023 contains $3.4 billion for the submarine industrial base. This would help substantially, though it will take years before the fleet feels the effects of those funds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forward rearming:&lt;/strong&gt; In wargames, submarines rapidly exhaust their munition inventories and must return to base to reload. Currently, those reload locations are limited to Guam and Yokosuka. The Navy is considering additional reload locations and could, for example, build more submarine tenders. Accelerating the reload cycle gets submarines get back into the fight more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bringing-more-forces-to-bear-more-effectively&quot;&gt;Bringing More Forces to Bear, More Effectively&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in Chapter 2, the United States has many allies and partners in the Western Pacific. The challenge is bringing these forces to bear, especially since there is no overarching alliance like NATO to establish joint structures and set standards. Instead, these must be established bilaterally. Measures to enhance cooperation include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coalition Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I) Packages:&lt;/strong&gt; These systems are critical for creating a common operating picture across an entire coalition. However, every country has its own technologies and procedures. Therefore, systems that allow the U.S. C3I systems to link with those of an ally or partner would be enormously valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Such systems must be effective without multibillion-dollar acquisition programs, imposition of common standards, or years of training and exercises. Although all these approaches would be useful, they are likely unobtainable except with the closest allies because of the cost and need to exchange highly sensitive data. One example of an alternative approach would be a deployable package that could sit in an allied or partner command center. This would build on the fusion centers that already exist. However, many other approaches are possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In considering solutions, the perfect is the enemy of the good. It would be better to have some simple systems in the hands of U.S. and allied forces now, given the immediacy of the threat, rather than wait for the perfect network solution in the distant future.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The working group emphasized that these arrangements need to be made before war breaks out. Improvising joint C3I during a conflict takes time, misses warfighting opportunities, and weakens defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air and Maritime Domain Awareness:&lt;/strong&gt; All three potential conflict scenarios — invasion, blockade, and gray zone competition — require excellent air and maritime domain awareness. The United States and its allies and partners need to know the location of potential adversaries’ forces, their own forces, and coalition forces. The latter can be challenging because allied and coalition forces do not always connect to friendly information systems. Low-tech solutions may, therefore, be a better option to bridge gaps in air/maritime domain awareness with some allies and partners. This requirement does not diminish as the intensity of conflict diminishes; it is as important for gray zone competition and blockades as it is for full-scale conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coalition Training:&lt;/strong&gt; Some allies, such as Australia and Japan, have highly trained forces; others struggle to attain adequate levels of training proficiency. All allies and the United States need training on how to work together. Analyses and wargames often gloss over “soft” factors such as training. The United States has recognized the need for training and education for decades, instituting a wide variety of training programs with allies. The availability of troops and units to conduct this training is frequently a constraint. Expanded contractor support could increase coalition training opportunities and thereby link military forces more closely.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Contractors can supplement military personnel in meeting these training demands and have done so in the past. Indeed, contractors have been described as the fourth element of military force structure, along with active-duty troops, National Guard and reserves, and government civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contractor Logistics Support:&lt;/strong&gt; Many allies and partners struggle with obsolescent equipment and readiness challenges. All militaries must compete with the civilian sector for technically skilled personnel to maintain the equipment. Further, maintainers are often junior enlisted personnel who are essentially apprentices as they gain experience. As with training, one solution is to have contractors augment military personnel. Contractors often have substantial technical skills that can supplement military maintenance efforts, not just in peacetime but also in wartime. The U.S. experience in Iraq and Afghanistan was that contractors would stay at their posts in conflicts as long as they understood the risks beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operating-in-a-hostile-environment&quot;&gt;Operating in a Hostile Environment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been able to threaten adversary forces at increasing distances by building large missile forces, and it is not alone in this regard. Russia and Iran have similarly developed long-range capabilities. Although this environment is widely understood and appreciated in the United States, it will nevertheless be a shock for U.S. naval and air forces, which have operated in sanctuary for many decades. The following actions would enhance the ability to operate in this hostile environment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aircraft Dispersion:&lt;/strong&gt; Wargaming indicates that aircraft are most vulnerable on the ground. For many years, the U.S. solution to airbase defense was interceptors. That is still an essential part of any strategy but is insufficient because of the potentially massive strikes that China can conduct. Therefore, another element of the strategy needs to be dispersal. The Air Force has recognized this with its agile combat employment doctrine. The doctrine seeks to “shift operations from centralized physical infrastructures to a network of smaller, dispersed locations that can complicate adversary planning and provide more options for joint force commanders.” Part of implementing the doctrine involves training personnel and conducting exercises. However, part requires creating the units and equipment needed to operate successfully from many more sites, some of which may be austere and lack the required supporting capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aircraft Survivability:&lt;/strong&gt; The Air Force has made some investments in explosive ordinance demolition and runway repair, recognizing that air bases will be attacked. These initiatives should be continued. One aspect of aircraft survivability that the Air Force has not embraced is hardened shelters. Although the United States built many during the Cold War, it has not built any since. Yet, dispersal alone is insufficient because of the large number of aircraft requiring forward basing and the need to continue using large U.S. bases despite missile strikes. Without hardened shelters, any aircraft at these bases would be highly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surface Ships’ Defensive Capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Surface ships that want to operate west of Guam during a conflict with China need strong defensive capabilities. Indeed, any ship operating near a hostile shore needs strong and vigilant defenses, as the Russian cruiser Moskva learned to its sorrow. The Navy is aware of this and is constantly upgrading ship defensive systems. This project is never done, as adversaries continue to develop new attack capabilities that require new responses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asymmetric Capabilities for Taiwan:&lt;/strong&gt; Taiwan’s need for asymmetric defenses has been widely discussed and needs no expansion here. This does not mean that Taiwan should retire all of its conventional capabilities. However, it does mean that asymmetric capabilities — land-based antiship missiles, land-based air defenses, sea mines, and missile boats — need greater priority because of their ability to survive in this increasingly hostile environment. This is often called a “porcupine” strategy and has been hotly debated in Taiwan. A more balanced force structure would also enhance deterrence by reducing the possibility of a debilitating Chinese first strike.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resilience against Cyberattacks:&lt;/strong&gt; Cyber defenses are now well established as integral to modern warfare. These defenses need to be tended continuously like those in any other domain. The war in Ukraine has shown that robust cyber defenses are possible, particularly when developed in connection with commercial firms. These defenses cannot deflect all attacks but can protect friendly assets sufficiently so that cyberattacks do not have a major operational impact.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resilience against Electronic Warfare:&lt;/strong&gt; The working group emphasized that China has powerful electronic warfare capabilities, and many wargames have speculated about what these capabilities might be able to do. This represents a level of threat that other post-Cold War adversaries have not possessed. Decades of operating in “electronic sanctuary” have created vulnerabilities in U.S. and allied forces even as electronic systems have greatly enhanced military capabilities. One vulnerability is the loss of communications. Such a loss would not be absolute because some mechanisms for communication will always be available. However, a generation of military officers has become accustomed to reliable voice, internet, chat rooms, and video and will find it difficult to operate in a severely degraded communications environment. Finding ways to harden communications, for example, by using wire and cable instead of airwaves, would cushion the force against electronic warfare shock.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Related to the loss of communications is the loss of the Global Positioning System (GPS). As with reliable communications, U.S. and partner forces have come to expect reliable GPS service for guiding munitions, ascertaining unit locations, and developing a common operating picture. Indeed, GPS is so ingrained into U.S. operations that loss of its capability would have second and third-order effects that are not fully understood. Alternatives to GPS, such as determining location through inertial navigation systems and even old-fashioned map reading, are available. However, the accuracy, precision, and low cost of GPS make adopting alternatives difficult despite the system’s widely recognized vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contested Logistics:&lt;/strong&gt; Since the German U-boats of World War II, no adversary has been able to interfere with U.S. logistics flow. That is changing. China can now disrupt flows within the second island chain and will soon be able to reach beyond that. Building logistics systems that can operate in a contested environment requires new technologies, platforms, and concepts. The Navy has begun such adaptation by closing the Red Hill depot and instead building a network of fuel distribution points, including on-call tankers. The military services are conducting wargames to understand what contested logistics mean operationally. However, programmatic efforts in this space have just begun.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hedging-against-unconventional-threats&quot;&gt;Hedging against Unconventional Threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When thinking about threats, it is natural to mirror image, imagining that threats to U.S. forces are the same as threats to adversary forces. For many aspects of great power conflict, this is true. However, some challenges from adversaries lack strong U.S. counterparts, and these need careful consideration lest the United States be surprised. Such challenges include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Countering Mines:&lt;/strong&gt; Periodically, a major article appears in military journals noting how sea mines have constituted the greatest threat to U.S. Navy ships since World War II and bemoaning the lack of preparation to deal with this well-documented threat. The United States could encounter mines in any future conflict, whether due to an invasion of Taiwan, a blockade, or gray zone competition. Countering mine warfare requires locating minefields, clearing lanes, and then keeping the lanes open. This, in turn, requires a spectrum of capabilities from mine reconnaissance to mine neutralization. In the past, the United States has developed a variety of imaginative approaches, from using sea mammals to spot mines to sailing sacrificial ships through minefields. Yet, U.S. countermine capabilities today remain weak.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Countering Maritime Swarming:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese maritime swarming comes up repeatedly in wargames and analyses. The tactic seeks to defeat adversaries without kinetic attack. This low-level threat is not something the United States has had to deal with because of its powerful naval forces, but it is a day-to-day reality for many allies and partners in the Western Pacific. Technologies that inhibit swarming tactics without resorting to deadly force would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Efforts to counter piracy developed some non-kinetic approaches such as fire hoses, restricted shipboard access, and barbed wire. In a blockade or gray zone confrontation, these same systems could be used to counter attempts to board transiting vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Portable defensive packages might be placed on merchant ships to provide some protection. Such packages would include capabilities that are too expensive to place on every ship but inexpensive enough to be produced in large numbers and deployed on those ships that need it. Some examples include sonic systems, foams, water cannons, and dazzlers to discourage boarding parties. The aim is to increase survivability to the point where operations are viable, not to prevent all losses, which is an unattainable goal. This space is open for imaginative solutions, as major navies have historically been less susceptible to these challenges, and therefore, not thought deeply about them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The DOD’s Joint Nonlethal Weapons Program has developed a wide variety of nonlethal systems “to arm the Joint Force with the fullest range of capabilities in support of National Security objectives.” Many of the technologies developed by the task force have been used in combat. Expanding them to partner nations and commercial shippers would be new but could potentially provide significant leverage in a blockade or gray zone situation. Partner nations might find these capabilities easier to employ during gray zone or blockade confrontations because they are the ones being directly threatened. Commercial organizations might use these capabilities under the concept of self-defense, expanding what they have done to protect themselves against pirates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UASs to Harass the Harassers:&lt;/strong&gt; Building on the discussion above, small, shipborne UASs might help thwart harassment by Chinese ships, particularly nonmilitary vessels such as the China Coast Guard and Maritime Militia. By harassing the harassers, UASs could warn of impending danger and interfere with attacks by Chinese water cannons or “shouldering.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defending-against-all-manifestations-of-air-threats&quot;&gt;Defending against All Manifestations of Air Threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An area universally noted in discussions about future conflict is the need to counter a wide variety of air threats, from ballistic missiles, to cruise missiles, to UASs. Once the province of well-funded states, these capabilities are now obtainable by every nation. Indeed, even non-national groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas now field large rocket and cruise missile forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This drives a demand for air defenses to protect populations, military forces, and the flow of goods. Missile defenses need not be 100 percent effective to have value. All defenses complicate an adversary’s planning. Such efforts could include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missile Defenses:&lt;/strong&gt; Regional U.S. ballistic missile defenses are relatively well developed since these threats have been around for a while, such as from North Korea, Iran, and Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. Cruise missile defenses have received considerable attention recently as more countries have obtained these missiles, and U.S. ground-based air defenses have atrophied. The CSIS Missile Defense Project has written extensively about these needs. Although many of these analyses have focused on U.S. homeland defense, many of the insights and systems described are applicable to overseas operations and other countries. Their 2023 report on the Russian missile offensive against Ukraine notes that U.S. missile defense systems have been largely successful in intercepting Russian missiles, that fixed air defense platforms are themselves highly vulnerable, and that passive defenses remain critical to mitigating missile threats. Their 2022 review of North American missile defense architecture argues that U.S. homeland cruise missile defenses have been neglected, leaving the United States vulnerable to non-nuclear attack and coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Even hypersonic missiles can be countered. A pair of CSIS Missile Defense Program reports argue that, although hypersonic missiles are formidable weapons, they are not unbeatable. The United States can develop defenses, and these can be deployed overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counter Uncrewed Aerial Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; The wars in Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas have highlighted the need to counter UASs with inexpensive systems. Systems designed for aircraft and cruise missile defense are too expensive. It makes little sense to shoot down a $20,000 kamikaze UAS with a million-dollar missile. Further, countering the swarms of cheap, often commercial reconnaissance UASs requires many systems to cover the entire length of the front lines.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This need is not a surprise, as the United States has been developing a wide variety of such systems for some time, including small-scale interceptor rockets, electronic warfare and jammers, and nets that capture adversary UASs. While some of these countermeasures involve complex technologies, others are simple since many Chinese UASs rely on simple radio links that can easily be jammed or overpowered. Many of these countermeasures have been sent to Ukraine. On the horizon is the possibility of directed energy weapons, which could rapidly attack multiple targets at low cost per shot.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the field is underdeveloped, and with UAS technology constantly evolving, a measure/countermeasure competition will play out for many years. Innovation and new systems will be needed constantly.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The working group emphasized that systems to counter small and medium-sized UASs need to be integrated with front-line units because UASs are so widely proliferated. Creating specialized units is not sufficiently responsive except for dealing with the largest UASs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;thinking-offensively-even-when-on-the-defense&quot;&gt;Thinking Offensively, Even When on the Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the literature relating to the Western Pacific is about defense and coping with Chinese A2/AD capabilities. This is reasonable considering the threat environment. However, even in defensive situations, there are opportunities for the offense. Several technologies can facilitate these opportunities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jamming and Counter-C3I:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese reliance on “information agility” and “system-of-systems” operational concepts opens vulnerabilities. Without fully functioning C3I systems to coordinate and integrate, the disconnected parts will be less than the integrated whole. Thus, jamming activities could pay huge dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncrewed Surface Vessels:&lt;/strong&gt; USVs might provide a way to operate inside the Chinese defensive zone while minimizing risk to crewed surface ships. The Navy is investigating many such vessels, from the size of rowboats to the size of corvettes. All can extend the sensor range of crewed vessels. The additional standoff distance provides more warning of attack and longer-range targeting for offensive weapons. Larger USVs will likely incorporate weapons, thus increasing the magazine depth of the total fleet. The Navy is conducting many experiments in this area, not having settled on a particular architecture or set of programs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The working group saw great potential here and noted that USV command and control was much easier than with UUVs because air is a better medium for communications than water. However, they cautioned against making the platforms multi-mission. That increased cost and complexity, removing one of their advantages over crewed systems. Instead, missions for both USVs and UASs (below) should be focused.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncrewed Aerial Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Like USVs, UASs offer the ability to extend sensor range and potentially be strike assets of their own, with the ability to penetrate A2/AD zones without risking crews. Unlike USVs and UUVs, the Navy has several programs of record, the MQ-25 Stingray and MQ-4 being the most relevant here. The MQ-25 program has particular potential. Its units are beginning production and will reach the fleet in 2026. Although currently configured as tankers, they have the potential to be strike assets on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypersonic Weapons:&lt;/strong&gt; Hypersonic weapons have become the iconic weapon of the new era, with close attention being paid to the technology’s relative development among the United States, China, and Russia. As noted earlier, the problem with hypersonic missiles is their high cost. Nevertheless, even low-inventory weapons can be hugely valuable. The ability of hypersonic weapons to strike distant, high-value, and well-defended targets holds at risk adversary assets that might otherwise be invulnerable or nearly so. Losing these assets, such as headquarters or major platforms, such as aircraft carriers, would disproportionately affect adversary capabilities and morale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standoff Sea Mines:&lt;/strong&gt; As previously noted, sea mines are enormously powerful weapons because of their latency and covertness. However, emplacing them can be a challenge, particularly for the United States, which abides by international rules and has relatively distant bases. Mines that need to be dropped from aircraft risk the survivability of the delivery platform. Mines that can glide some distance reduce this vulnerability. Thus, standoff mines have great potential. The United States has begun developing such a capability with the QuickStrike Extended Range mine, but there is much more that could be done given the increasing strength of Chinese and Russian air defenses. Indeed, sea mines and similar technologies — such as new kinds of mines, decoys, and different emplacement methods — are areas where creative solutions can add friction to Chinese military plans.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The working group recommended enhancing the sea mine capabilities of regional allies since they were already present at key locations and had the latitude to conduct mining in their territorial waters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-opportunities-for-cooperation&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Opportunities for Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foregoing lays out many areas of potential cooperation between nations and between the governments and their defense industry. All provide insight into the question of what might be done while waiting for the submarine fleet to expand. Some areas may prove more fruitful or easier to coordinate than others. Deciding which to pursue requires prototyping, experimentation, and field testing. That process needs to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only by beginning the forward movement can the assessment process illuminate challenges that inevitably occur. For example, export controls and restrictions on data sharing are emerging as key challenges to the technology coordination envisioned by AUKUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, government decisions on promising technologies signal industry where it should focus its attention and resources. The defense industry in every country wants to produce products that the defense establishment requires, but these industries need pointers to ensure they are being responsive to government strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（10日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第9日審訊。控方讀出負責財政調查的國安處女高級督察洪麗芬所撰之書面供詞。當中提及黎智英自2013至2016年間，以「不明原因」向美國前國防部副部長 Paul Wolfowitz 轉賬共約176萬港元，黎於2017年亦曾向天主教香港教區榮休主教陳日君樞機轉賬共350萬。另外，供詞指黎智英自2013年起透過助手 Mark Simon 及其公司，向泛民政黨轉賬近1億元，民主黨曾獲轉賬8百萬，其他政黨包括工黨及社民連；至於前立法會議員區諾軒亦獲轉賬37萬。辯方透露，將會爭議專家證人、為梁美芬丈夫的城大法律學院教授王貴國所撰報告的呈堂性，將於明天呈交書面陳詞。案件押後至下周二（16日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方高級檢控官陳穎琛，讀出負責財政調查的國安處女督察洪麗芬的36頁供詞，她主要調查案中各人的銀行戶口及資金流向，包括：黎智英、李宇軒、陳梓華、黎的助手 Mark Simon、劉祖廸、張劍虹、陳沛敏、羅偉光、林文宗、馮偉光、楊清奇及《蘋果日報》公司。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警指黎向美國前國防部副部長轉賬176萬向陳日君樞機轉賬350萬&quot;&gt;警指黎向美國前國防部副部長轉賬176萬、向陳日君樞機轉賬350萬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;供詞指，黎智英於2013、2014及2016年，以「不明原因（unknown reason）」向美國前國防部副部長 Paul Wolfowitz 共轉賬22萬美元（約176萬港元）。他亦於2015至2017年向「美國企業研究院（American Enterprise Institute）」轉賬11萬港元。黎於2017年，分兩次向天主教香港教區榮休主教陳日君樞機轉賬共350萬。黎同時曾向陳梓華及「香港監察」分別轉賬14萬及20萬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警指黎旗下公司向泛民政黨轉賬約2千萬-包括民主黨工黨社民連&quot;&gt;警指黎旗下公司向泛民政黨轉賬約2千萬 包括民主黨、工黨、社民連&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;屬黎智英旗下的加拿大公司「LAIS Hotel Properties Limited」曾多次向泛民不同政黨轉賬共約2千萬，包括於2019年向民主黨轉賬約8百萬、向工黨轉賬1百萬、向民主黨總部轉賬5百萬、向社民連轉賬50萬。同年他亦轉賬36萬給李宇軒。至2020年，「LAIS Hotel」向社民連轉賬43萬，以及向前立法會議員區諾軒轉賬37萬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警指黎轉賬118億予助手-當中9千萬轉予泛民政黨&quot;&gt;警指黎轉賬1.18億予助手 當中9千萬轉予泛民政黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，Mark Simon 於2013至2020年期間，收到黎智英轉賬約1.18億港元。Mark Simon 其後分70多次將其中9,300萬元轉賬予不同政黨，包括於2014年向民主黨轉賬2萬元，於2019年轉賬25萬及10萬港元予支聯會。他於2019年亦轉賬3萬元予陳梓華，同年轉賬50萬予李宇軒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警指mark-simon轉4百萬予何謝韋律師事務所&quot;&gt;警指Mark Simon轉4百萬予何謝韋律師事務所&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Simon 於2016年曾收到來自黎智英持有的「Comitex Knitters（公明織造廠有限公司）」匯款5百萬，然後將2百萬港元轉賬至何謝韋律師事務所（Ho Tse Wai, Philip Li &amp;amp; Partners），其餘3百萬港元則轉賬予民主黨。但其後銀行本票被彈回，於是 Mark Simon 再把3百萬轉賬予民主黨。另外，黎智英其後亦透過 Mark Simon 再轉賬2百萬予何謝韋律師事務所。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黎智英的資金來源方面，來自香港及台灣的分別有10億，其他的包括美國、新加坡、加拿大等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警指李宇軒支付980萬予本地及海外媒體公司-作登報宣傳費&quot;&gt;警指李宇軒支付980萬予本地及海外媒體公司 作登報宣傳費&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「重光團隊」核心成員李宇軒，他共有6個銀行賬戶，共涉6項存款及41項提款紀錄。於2019年6月28日進行首次眾籌行動後，李宇軒經美國的 E Stripe Payments E Limitied 獲得615萬港元轉賬至其渣打銀行戶口。至於在2019年8月8日的第二次眾籌，《蘋果日報》專欄作家 Jack Henry Hazlewood 的英國銀行賬戶，轉賬了30萬英鎊（約310萬港元）到李宇軒的渣打戶口。於2019年11月21日，黎的助手 Mark Simon 再轉賬50萬港元予李宇軒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒曾使用眾籌及 Mark Simon 轉賬予他的款項，共約980萬港元，支付予本港及國際的媒體或傳播公司，作為宣傳及出版費，涉及的日期為2019年6月26日至2020年6月15日。該些公司包括《自由時報》（Liberty Time Limited）、「白宮顧問有限公司（The Whitehouse Consultancy Limited）」。而屬黎智英的公司「LAIS Hotel Properties Limited」，則先為李宇軒墊支，向《日經》支付約147萬港元的出版費，其後李歸還款項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，「LAIS Hotel」亦於2019年6月向英國《衛報》支付1.8萬英鎊（約17萬港元）、向美國《華盛頓郵報》支付8萬美元（約66萬港元）、向意大利《RCS Media Group S.p.A》支付20,000歐元（約17萬港元）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎於錄影會面承認為專欄文章之作者-被問誰批准刊其他文章時稱唔知&quot;&gt;黎於錄影會面承認為專欄文章之作者 被問誰批准刊其他文章時稱「唔知」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接着播放黎智英約一小時的警誡會面紀錄。國安處警員5830於2020年9月向黎錄取警誡會面，當時有律師在場陪同。期間警方向黎展示多篇《蘋果日報》刊登的文章。警方問及由誰人撰寫及誰批准刊登，黎均表示「無嘢想講」及「唔知」。警方亦展示署名為黎智英的「成敗樂一笑」專欄文章，包括於2019年12月刊登的〈我們堅持下去，才有希望〉，黎承認是他本人撰寫。惟被問及撰寫目的時，他表示「無嘢想講」。其他均是其署名的文章包括：〈反極權 台灣更不害怕〉及〈2020年和勇一起撐下去〉。警方展示於2019年11月刊登的文章〈參議員關注暴力升級 黎智英冀美多發聲 令青年面對警暴不孤單〉，並播放相關片段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎表示不認識李宇軒-又指不認識lais-hotel公司擁有人&quot;&gt;黎表示不認識李宇軒 又指不認識「LAIS Hotel」公司擁有人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方其後展示黎曾經在社交媒體轉貼的推文。警方亦問黎是否認識李宇軒，他回答「唔認識」。另外，警方展示「LAIS Hotel」向《華盛頓郵報》、《衛報》等國際媒體登報的單據。警方問及有否匯款到《衛報》，黎表示「應該冇」。黎亦表示不認識「LAIS Hotel」公司擁有人或股東，黎表示「唔認識」。被問公司是否屬於其名下，他回答「唔知」、「無嘢講」。警方又問，單據的收款人為《華盛頓郵報》，黎與該公司有否連繫，黎表示「冇，冇嘢想講」。警方亦問，力高公司是否屬黎名下，以及其運作情況，黎表示「冇嘢想講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方透露爭議法律教授王貴國的專家報告-明交書面陳詞&quot;&gt;辯方透露爭議法律教授王貴國的專家報告 明交書面陳詞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黎智英的辯方大律師關文渭昨表示，將會爭議專家證人、為梁美芬丈夫的城大法律學院教授王貴國所撰報告的呈堂性，主要爭議其專家報告對「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」控罪元素的關連性。辯方亦指，會爭議王貴國就美國之外，在其他國家實施相關制裁方面的專家知識。但副刑事檢控專員周天行強調，王的專家證供只涉美國的部分。辯方將會明天下午5時前呈交書面陳詞，控方會於下周一早上呈交書面回應陳詞，並於下周二作口頭陳詞。至於代表3間蘋果日報公司清盤人的大律師王國豪則指，他們仍未決定是否加入申請，並需時索取指示。法庭要求他於本周五去信通知其決定。案件押後至下周二（16日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

While these ships support scientific and commercial objectives, they can also help China’s navy understand the maritime environment as it ventures into less familiar waters like the Indian Ocean.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is undertaking sweeping efforts to transform its navy into a formidable “blue water” force capable of projecting power far beyond its shores. As the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) ventures into less familiar waters like the Indian Ocean, Beijing has sought to deepen its understanding of the maritime operating environment by studying water conditions, currents, and the seafloor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To survey the Earth’s oceans, China has developed the world’s largest fleet of civilian research vessels. While these ships support scientific and commercial objectives, they are also being used to advance Beijing’s strategic ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZEGClV6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Chinese oceanographic surveys span the globe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Maritime activity data collected using the Windward Intelligence Platform reveals Chinese survey vessels have carried out hundreds of thousands of hours of operations globally over the past four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hidden Reach analyzed Chinese oceanographic missions since 2020 and identified 64 active research and survey vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China’s dual-use approach to oceanographic research raises questions about the nature of these activities. Many vessels that undertake missions for peaceful purposes are also capable of providing the PLA with critical data about the world’s oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Of the 64 active vessels, over 80 percent have demonstrated suspect behavior or possess organizational links suggesting their involvement in advancing Beijing’s geopolitical agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China’s surveying operations have been heavily concentrated along its maritime periphery in the South China Sea and western Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But it has also set its sights on the Indian Ocean, an emerging arena of competition between Beijing and New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The PLA can leverage the insights gained from these missions to enhance its knowledge of the dynamic undersea environment — a crucial precursor to confidently deploying naval forces abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploring and mapping the world’s oceans is not unique to China. Dozens of countries have active oceanographic research programs, which contribute to global efforts to study climate change, marine life, geology, and the distribution of natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is also not alone in applying oceanographic research to support military needs. Yet the scale of China’s activities is immense, and the line between its civilian and military research is heavily blurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s lack of transparency makes it challenging to discern the true nature of its survey operations, but three specific indicators shed light on which vessels may be supporting Beijing’s military and national security objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vessel-ownership-and-type&quot;&gt;Vessel Ownership and Type&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of China’s research vessels are owned and operated by state-affiliated organizations with close ties to the Chinese military. For example, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Chinese Academy of Sciences both operate research vessels and have signed cooperation agreements with the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some survey ships were in service with the PLA before entering civilian service. Hulls in the Xiang Yang Hong (向阳红) class, for example, were originally built for the Chinese navy but were later transferred to civilian authorities with ties to the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other ships are operated directly by the Chinese Coast Guard, which ultimately reports to the country’s Central Military Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese officials are not always quiet about the dual function of these ships. During the commissioning of the Shiyan 06 (实验-06), officials acknowledged the ship would “provide strong scientific and technological support for homeland security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-affiliated-port-visits&quot;&gt;Military-Affiliated Port Visits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Chinese survey ships have a record of calling at port in military-affiliated facilities in China. This includes Sanya, Guangzhou, Qingdao, and other ports known to host major contingents of PLA Navy warships and maritime militia vessels. Some have also visited China’s unlawfully constructed military outposts in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, some vessels have gone dark for hours or days while near PLA installations, a potential sign of intentional efforts to obscure activities there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;activities&quot;&gt;Activities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behavior at sea can also raise red flags. Repeated instances of “spoofing” (providing falsified identification information) or “going dark” (turning off automatic identification system signals for extended periods) are important warning signs. Data from Windward indicates these activities occur frequently — sometimes near foreign military facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other instances, China has deployed research vessels to strengthen its presence in geopolitical hotspots. Commercial and scientific research ships, such as those operated by the state-owned China Oilfield Services Limited (COSL), have played a major role in helping Beijing assert its claims of “indisputable sovereignty” over vast swaths of the contested South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some ships have conducted survey operations within the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of other countries without prior approval, which is prohibited under international law. These activities have sparked diplomatic spats, including a 2019 confrontation between an Indian warship and Chinese research vessel operating unauthorized in India’s EEZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blurred boundaries between China’s oceanographic research ecosystem and its expansive national security apparatus bear the hallmarks of Beijing’s military-civil fusion (军民融合) strategy, which seeks to break down barriers between the country’s civilian and military scientific, technological, and economic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s national economic blueprint, the 14th Five Year Plan, names deep sea exploration as one of its seven focus areas for scientific and technological research and calls for the development of “submarine scientific observation networks.” In 2021, the Ministry of Natural Resources laid out specific guidance on furthering the Five Year Plan, including linking ocean surveying to military objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLA personnel have written extensively on the need for a robust set of advanced deep-sea technologies to support undersea warfare, a domain where China considerably lags the U.S. military. The data collected by China’s civilian research fleet, which is outfitted with cutting-edge measuring and monitoring equipment, can help fill in major gaps in the PLA Navy’s undersea capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The connections between the Chinese military and civilian oceanographic research are often in plain sight. The PLA Navy Submarine Academy openly touts its frequent collaborations with China’s major maritime research institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (QNLM) is the crown jewel in China’s oceanographic research technology ecosystem. It is located among a cluster of advanced research labs built near the submarine academy’s main campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These partnerships have raised security concerns abroad. Texas A&amp;amp;M University terminated a research partnership with QNLM in 2022, citing “more than 200 instances of Foreign Talent Recruitment activity.” In the same year, the U.S. Department of Commerce added QNLM to its Entity List due to its involvement in supporting China’s military modernization efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oX0OKOP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;xiang-yang-hong-06-向阳红-06&quot;&gt;XIANG YANG HONG 06 向阳红 06&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of China’s most extensive expeditions took place in 2019 and 2020, when the research vessel Xiang Yang Hong 06 traveled more than 10,000 kilometers over 110 days to survey vast swaths of the Indian Ocean. Scientists from Sri Lanka and Myanmar joined for parts of the ship’s expedition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Part of its mission involved releasing 12 advanced underwater gliders and deploying 15 profiling floats, which spent months collecting data on the area’s hydrological conditions. That data was then fed back to China via satellite transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These floats are part of an effort to build up a real-time ocean observation network of hundreds of devices spanning the “Two Oceans and One Sea” (两洋一海) region, a conceptualization of the Pacific and Indian Oceans and South China Sea put forward by Beijing as a focus area for maritime surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/imS6gpY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;hai-yang-shi-you-760-海洋石油-760&quot;&gt;HAI YANG SHI YOU 760 海洋石油 760&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In another telling example, the seismic survey ship Hai Yang Shi You 760 completed a four-month ocean bed mapping mission in early 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The vessel is owned and operated by COSL, a subsidiary of the state-owned oil giant China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). During its mission, it followed an extensive “lawnmower” path within Bangladesh’s EEZ, indicating the vessel was exploring the seabed for oil and gas deposits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;CNOOC ships and large-scale rigs have been routinely deployed to assert Beijing’s sovereignty claims in the highly contested South China Sea. In 2012, CNOOC’s chairman famously referred to the firm’s oil rigs as a “strategic weapon” supporting national interests. CNOOC’s ties to the PLA led the U.S. Treasury Department to add the firm to its Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is no indication that the Hai Yang Shi You 760 operated within Bangladesh’s EEZ without official consent. Its repeated port calls at Chittagong suggest it received permission. Nonetheless, the seismic and bathymetric data collected during the survey could be of significant value to the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once the survey was complete, the Hai Yang Shi You 760 returned to its home port at Zhanjiang, just beside the headquarters of the PLA Navy’s South Sea Fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DOVgfjh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;shiyan-06-实验-06&quot;&gt;SHIYAN 06 实验 06&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;More recently, in October 2023, the research vessel Shiyan 06 entered the eastern Indian Ocean bound for the Port of Colombo in Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The vessel is operated by the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, a research institute that has provided technical and logistical support for China’s militarization of the South China Sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka initially demurred on China’s requests to dock the vessel at Colombo due to objections raised by India. Local researchers also expressed concern about their lack of access to the data gathered by Chinese expeditions. Colombo eventually relented, however, allowing the Shiyan 06 to dock for five days before it left to execute research surveys along the island’s west coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Beijing’s interest in Sri Lanka goes well beyond scientific pursuits. China’s massive investments in ports and other infrastructure there have raised concerns — including from the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) — that the PLA has likely considered setting up a military facility in the island nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Chinese surveys in the Indian Ocean contribute to scientific and commercial efforts, the data collected on research missions has clear military value — especially to submarine operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent Chinese defense white paper highlights the need for the PLA to support “far seas protection and strategic projection.” The Indian Ocean is a pivotal region for the PLA as it pushes to extend its “strategic perimeter” (战略外线) farther from China’s borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underwater domain is critical to China’s interests in the Indian Ocean. Chinese submarines could be called on to support a wide range of missions, ranging from intelligence collection to nuclear deterrence patrols. In a crisis, Chinese attack submarines operating there could complicate attempts by U.S. or allied forces to interdict China’s supply lines or traverse the region to reach the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gcv8Uaf.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ This Hidden Reach Snapshot uses satellite imagery to reveal how China is quietly using submarine diplomacy to deepen its influence along the Bay of Bengal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding submarine operations, however, requires overcoming significant hurdles. China’s lack of a nearby military facility forces its submarines to navigate key chokepoints between the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing may seek to address this vulnerability. The U.S. DOD assesses that China has likely considered 18 countries as potential hosts for an additional overseas military facility. Of these, 11 ring the massive Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with a regional military facility, submarine operations remain highly complex — a fact that has been brought home to the PLA Navy through its own experiences and those of foreign navies. In 2014, a Chinese submarine operating near Hainan Island was nearly lost when it encountered an unexpected change in water density, causing the submarine to sink rapidly into an underwater trench. The PLA Navy awarded the captain and crew high honors for successfully averting disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safely navigating submarines requires thorough knowledge of complex undersea conditions. Changes in subsurface topography, currents, thermoclines, salinity, and other factors have major impacts on how submarines navigate their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civilian oceanographic research helps to arm the PLA Navy with critical data, enhancing its capability to safely deploy in distant waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Eotzay0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA and its civilian surrogates are harvesting data from the world’s oceans. While scientific and commercial benefits may accrue from Chinese oceanographic research, these activities may also prove crucial for the PLA in expanding its operational reach and capabilities in the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This expansion poses a significant challenge to key regional players like India, as well as to the United States and its allies. Beijing’s track record of defying international norms to serve its own interests further heightens the stakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of China’s erstwhile partners in the region have started to pull back from research collaboration with China. At India’s encouragement, Sri Lanka announced in January 2024 that it would implement a one-year pause on Chinese research vessels docking at its ports. The country’s foreign minister suggested the ban would allow Sri Lanka to develop its capacity to “participate in such research activities as equal partners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such efforts are critical to holding Beijing to account. Engagement with Chinese researchers should not be unnecessarily curtailed, but these collaborations should be handled equitably and transparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long term, countries can also work together to ensure that a heightened PLA presence in the Indian Ocean does not destabilize the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s cooperation is crucial, and New Delhi has already demonstrated a degree of willingness to engage with partners. Amid simmering tensions with China, India has supported maritime security efforts with members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (or Quad).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China charts its course in the Indian Ocean, Washington and its partners should keep a close watch on Chinese actors and explore opportunities to cooperate as an effective ballast.&lt;/p&gt;

However, it may prove difficult for the West to effectively degrade Houthi capabilities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 30 December the USS Gravely, an Arleigh-Burke-class destroyer, responded to a distress call from the Maersk Hangzhou along with the USS Laboon. The CENTCOM post on X noting the event states simply that Gravely shot down two anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs) in the process of responding. An ASBM is technically a significant maritime strike capability; the fact that a non-state actor is in possession of this kind of weapon, and is employing it with impunity, is of grave concern. The US and its partners have responded to these attacks – 25 in total between 19 November and 4 January – primarily with defensive methods. However, a 4 January statement from the White House promised “consequences” if the Houthis do not end their attacks. This article will examine the Houthis’ capabilities and targeting possibilities for Western partners to counter them, as well as the difficulties they might face in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;top-shelf-capabilities&quot;&gt;Top-Shelf Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Houthis are able to deploy a range of missiles, drones and uncrewed kamikaze boats. Theoretically, the most sophisticated weapon available to them is the Asef ASBM, which carries a 500 kg warhead and has a range of 400 km. It employs an electro-optical seeker for the terminal phase of its target engagement, and is believed to be based on the Iranian Kahlij Fars ASBM. The Houthis also have access to anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs) such as the Al-Mandeb 2, which appears to be a close copy of the C-802, a Chinese ASCM sold to Iran in the 1990s. It has a range of 120 km and a 165 kg warhead; Iran reverse-engineered the C-802 into a domestic variant known as Noor. The ASCMs are truck-launched and have been used by the Houthis to damage and attack multiple ships since 2016. The C-802 or Noor was also used by Hizbullah to damage the Israeli ship INS Hanit in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Al-Mandeb 2 and Asef represent just two of the anti-ship missiles available to the Houthis; they claim to have developed many more domestically. The US disputes this claim and has reiterated that Iran either provides the weapons, or is instrumental in enabling the Houthis to build them. In addition to their arsenal of anti-ship missiles, the Houthis are also able to employ uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as the Samad-2 and -3. The latter can travel more than 1,500 km with an explosive payload, and is equipped with a dorsal antenna which likely enables it to be remotely operated as it approaches its target, while possibly being controlled in its terminal phase by a nearby operator on a small boat or onshore (though some UAVs may be controlled using satellite communications). Furthermore, the Houthis have attempted to board and seize vessels, as well as attack them with suicide boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strengths-and-weaknesses&quot;&gt;Strengths and Weaknesses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary strength of the Houthi missile arsenal is experience. The Saudi Air Force has been conducting strikes in Yemen since 2015, which means the Houthis have become adept at minimising the damage that they cause. In 2018, for example, they unveiled an underground missile launcher that was designed to conceal the launch site of ballistic missiles fired into Saudi Arabia. The Saudis were initially able to destroy much of the original Houthi missile arsenal in 2017, which was inherited from the Yemeni military. However, since then, the Houthis and Iran have developed and manufactured many more missiles and drones – 70 were fired into Saudi Arabia in March 2021 alone, with a total of 340 launches that year, despite 600 Coalition airstrikes per month. Not all of those airstrikes were targeted at the Houthi missile production infrastructure, but the number nevertheless serves to illustrate the group’s familiarity with Western air power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crucial weakness of the Houthis’ maritime strike capabilities is their lack of effective targeting infrastructure. A series of coastal radars were used in 2016 to coordinate attacks against UAE and US vessels in the Red Sea. However, three of them were subsequently destroyed by US strikes, and it is unlikely that the Houthis would use the same tactics again. Instead, it is believed that they are provided with intelligence from an Iranian surveillance ship, the MV Behshad. The Behshad is thought to be limited in its intelligence-gathering capabilities to signal intelligence (SIGINT) and observation of shipping movements. Its predecessor vessel, the Saviz, which was also a converted civilian cargo ship, carried a complement of fast boats which could be used to provide visual identification of target vessels as well as SIGINT. This, coupled with data UAVs and open source AIS tracking, can be used to triangulate the range and bearing of a target vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Securing shipping requires a disproportionately resource-intensive effort on the part of the defender relative to the attacker when the latter has the advantage of proximity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be sufficient to fire an ASCM in the direction of a vessel, while relying on its onboard seeker to identify a target in the terminal phase. This form of targeting would be less effective against warships, which can take evasive action and deploy countermeasures, but it is sufficient to enable strikes on commercial vessels. In principle, this should also be a viable means of targeting ASBMs, particularly as the altitudes that these missiles reach mean that their onboard sensors can cover very wide areas in the terminal phase. The challenge, however, is that ballistic missiles require a manoeuvrable re-entry vehicle (MARV) to be accurate against moving targets. MARVs are inherently difficult to design and could not be easily moved from Iran, so it is not clear that Houthi ASBMs have them. This could explain the margins by which they appear to have missed their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenges-of-defence-and-coercion&quot;&gt;The Challenges of Defence and Coercion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major issue facing the Coalition is not the difficulty of intercepting Houthi missiles and UAVs per se, but rather the cost of doing so and the mismatch between tactical and strategic effectiveness. While vessels such as the USS Carney have proven highly capable, they have had to expend disproportionately expensive interceptors such as the SM-2 and ESSM in order to engage relatively cheap targets. Moreover, the challenges of replenishing vertical launch cells at sea mean that once a destroyer has expended its missile magazine, it must rotate to a friendly facility to reload. Aircraft such as the carrier-based F/A-18 can operate in a defensive role and can be reloaded more effectively, but this requires the persistent presence of a US aircraft carrier in the region when the demand signal from other theatres is growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, securing shipping requires a disproportionately resource-intensive effort on the part of the defender relative to the attacker when the latter has the advantage of proximity. This was illustrated during previous challenges to freedom of navigation such as the 1980s Tanker War. Because of this, the Coalition may have to shift its approach from defence to coercion, as only a cessation of Houthi attacks is likely to mitigate the effects of increased insurance costs and lengthened shipping routes. The challenge will be identifying an appropriate approach, as the Coalition will have to balance the need to present the Houthis with a credible threat to compel a change in behaviour with preventing misperceptions by both the Houthis and their Iranian backers which could lead to a larger conflict. Faced with the rollback of Hamas in Gaza and the possibility of an Israeli attack on Hizbullah, the Iranians could misperceive an extensive strike campaign against the Houthis as being part of a broader effort to roll back their regional proxy network, and may react unpredictably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-possible-approaches&quot;&gt;Three Possible Approaches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach, dubbed “turning the screw”, involves limited actions with the threat of more to come. This approach entails striking a target of marginal value, such as a missile launcher or a coastal radar, while withholding the option of further action to give the target an opportunity to comply. Though the Houthis have become adept at operating under conditions of adversary air superiority, countries such as the UAE have struck Houthi missile launchers in the past, and the US struck Houthi radars in 2016 in a similar effort. However, this approach cedes the option of escalation to the opponent, who may perceive limited action as evidence of irresolution and continue as if nothing had happened. This leaves the options of further strikes or backing down, and could mean sleepwalking into the large-scale conflagration one is trying to avoid. Should initial failure result in wider strikes to disable a larger number of launchers, this might prove indistinguishable from a full-scale bombing campaign to the Iranians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative approach would be to present the Houthis and Iranians with the prospect of large-scale attacks on the Houthis’ military infrastructure, along with a privately communicated deadline for compliance. Posturing for action at scale while communicating the conditions for de-escalation can deliver effects, as it did during the 1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, but time is on the side of the opponent. Posturing the resources needed to act at scale can only be done for a limited period, and an opponent can always desist for a time and wait for aircraft carriers to rotate out before resuming attacks. However, such an approach could secure temporary relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Houthis are a persistent and determined opponent, and it is unlikely that they will halt their strikes simply because they are ineffective&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most viable coercive approach would likely involve direct attacks against a limited but valuable target set. The model here would be Operation Praying Mantis, in which the US Navy sank a portion of the Iranian fleet during the Tanker War, but desisted from carrying out strikes inland. The target set chosen was valuable enough to dispel any ambiguity about irresolution, but did not threaten the Iranians with the prospect of wider US attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any target set chosen must combine several characteristics. It should involve targets with concentrated value where sufficient damage can be inflicted with a minimal number of strikes. It should also involve targets related to the Houthi maritime strike capability and exclude assets that are not, in order to signal limited intent. The latter would include command and control nodes, as strikes on them could be viewed as the opening stages of a wider campaign. There are targets within Yemen which might meet this description. For example, the Houthis’ indigenous missile manufacturing capability might represent a target that can be struck on a limited basis. Though the Houthis import missile components, assembly is often done locally and thus requires some specialist equipment and personnel, with the latter being especially hard to replace. This comes with certain risks, as these facilities and the personnel who man them are in urban nodes such as Sanaa. Stockpiles of missiles represent another target, as requirements such as temperature-controlled storage limit an opponent’s capacity to distribute them. Though these storage sites are hardened and buried, they can be struck with some existing maritime strike capabilities such as the Tomahawk Block V. The boats which may be used to cue UAVs like the Samad could also be struck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-sum&quot;&gt;In Sum&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Houthis’ maritime strike capabilities are technically advanced but lack targeting sophistication. They therefore represent a manageable threat that can be countered with air defence assets in the region, providing that Iran does not improve target cuing for the Houthis. However, the Houthis are a persistent and determined opponent, and it is unlikely that they will halt their strikes simply because they are ineffective. This makes direct coercion to stop them more likely. The most effective course of action would involve strikes against limited but valuable target sets within the Houthi organisation. Doing so would impact the group’s ability to continue its missile strikes while minimising the risk of a wider regional conflict, thereby enabling the US and other navies to free up capacity for other strategic concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, the paper addresses how the force design of the UK’s Royal Marines will need to evolve for the marines to be able to contribute to the amphibious capabilities of an alliance or a coalition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper argues that, rather than being a capability which is used to exploit sea control once a fleet has secured it, amphibious forces should represent a landward extension of the fleet. This is subtly different, as it involves closely integrating amphibious forces with two strictly naval functions: maritime strike; and efforts to secure sea control. Such a use of amphibious forces entails tactical specialisation, with a particular focus on closing a potential gap between bluewater navies and the joint force. However, as will be discussed, a tactical focus on enabling strikes need not limit the number of use cases for more specialised amphibious forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major feature of the future operating environment is likely to be adversaries with enhanced anti-access capabilities and longer-ranged fires ashore. For allied and coalition amphibious forces, this means that disembarked forces will need to be distributed more widely, and the shipping that supports them will have to operate from greater distances. While this challenge will be especially acute in contexts involving near-peer opponents, the proliferation of anti-access capabilities makes it a likely challenge in several contexts in which UK and allied amphibious forces may be deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper argues that adapting to this emerging operating environment will be best achieved through a concept of operations that subsumes amphibious power projection under the naval functions of strike and sea control. Distributed amphibious forces have a key operational role to play in tackling the challenge of enhanced anti-access capabilities through converging long-range fires capabilities. While this approach, epitomised by the US Marine Corps’ Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations framework, is typically treated as synonymous with sea denial, it in fact has wider applicability. Having a mix of dispersed long-ranged fires, both afloat and ashore, and small groups of raiding forces, can present serious dilemmas to large opposing ground forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the combination of raiding and fires is not an exclusively amphibious solution, forces capable of manoeuvring both at sea and on land can compound the challenge for an opponent. In many contexts, including the narrow archipelagic seas of Europe, using amphibious forces in this way would force an opponent to survey an extended littoral space that encompasses mainland areas, the maritime domain and offshore islands. This would considerably increase the opponent’s ISR burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of functions on the maritime side of the littoral to which amphibious forces can also contribute, among them the exercise of sea control in politically sensitive conditions. This paper argues that amphibious operations should therefore be subsumed under two naval missions – strike and sea control – rather than being treated as a separate function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this rubric, the Royal Marines have the potential to act as an enabling force, both for strike-centric partners, and for both UK and allied naval forces. As a light raiding force, the marines can set the conditions for strike missions to be conducted on favourable terms. An emphasis on a lighter disembarked force should allow the maritime enablers upon which the commando force depends to evolve in ways that make them more multifunctional. Once a requirement to move heavy equipment is reduced, more emphasis can be placed on priorities such as the ability to carry sensors and strike munitions and achieving low observability. This can then enable tasks such as sea control, as well as archipelagic warfare on both sides of the littoral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shifting the emphasis of the Royal Marines towards the two priorities of strike and sea control implies tactical specialisation. But it does not necessarily imply a limitation of the operational and strategic roles that marines will play. Having a strike-centric concept of operations has demonstrable utility, both in contingencies in Europe and at expeditionary reach. It would involve narrowing the tactical roles and certifications of commandos, as well as a reduced emphasis on traditional light infantry functions. However, the size of the force and the changing operating environment mean that many of these functions are likely to be redundant in any case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging threats are making theatre entry for amphibious forces as it is presently conducted increasingly difficult and increasing the demand on the rest of the fleet and the wider joint force to provide protection to such forces where they do contribute. The risk facing amphibious forces, then, is that the value of amphibious insertion comes to be seen as being outweighed by its costs and risks. It is the argument of this paper that amphibious forces, including the Royal Marines, need not cede the littoral to shore-based anti-access/area denial capabilities. Such forces have the potential to add considerable value to allied deterrence. But to be able to do so in the future operating environment, they must integrate more closely with fleets, both in conceptual terms and in force design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is based on work conducted by the UK’s Royal Marines and supported in areas by RUSI to address how the marines must evolve in the future operating environment. Its function is to elaborate the rationale for changes underway, as well as to discuss the decisions which will need to be made as the force continues to evolve. The paper addresses two research questions that will be of importance to the Royal Marines as they continue their efforts at force transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can Western amphibious forces, in particular those within NATO, continue to contribute to deterrence and competition in contested environments across the spectrum of conflict?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What will the Royal Marines, specifically, need to do to deliver value to an amphibious force generated by an alliance or coalition?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are a number of contexts in which amphibious forces can be useful, including a range of missions other than war, the paper’s focus is on operations in environments where forces’ freedom of manoeuvre is contested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the challenges that will be faced by amphibious forces in contested environments are common to all operating environments. The convergence of increasingly capable methods of sensor fusion and processing with the proliferation of long-range strike capabilities will make expeditionary forces vulnerable both at sea and on land. Both peer competitors and sub-peer challengers possess long-range strike capabilities that are becoming more cost effective and are proliferating as a result, along with – to varying degrees – the ability to cue them at reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While generating wide-area situational awareness at sea remains a complex task, the proliferation of sensors both military and commercial, coupled with developments in areas such as software-defined sensors and machine learning, will equip a growing range of actors with the ability to rapidly detect, classify and engage targets at sea. Movement inland will also become increasingly difficult. This has been illustrated in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. An evolving man-portable air defence system (MANPADS) threat adequately networked with longer-range radar can make airborne manoeuvre and assault – which previously helped to counteract the challenge of anti-access area denial (A2/AD) capabilities – increasingly risky. Once ashore, amphibious forces will have to contend with shorter-ranged fires, cruise and ballistic missiles, and attack from fixed-wing aircraft. The threat to amphibious lodgements is not new, but it will become increasingly multi-tiered, combining threats that fly at different altitudes with different profiles, making air defence increasingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, anti-access capabilities are likely to become more potent and, crucially, are no longer the preserve of a small subset of actors. Consider, for example, the Ukrainian army’s successful destruction of what were likely the forward elements of a Russian force near Odesa early in the conflict, or, in Yemen, the Houthi movement’s partially successful efforts to contest the anti-Houthi coalition’s freedom of movement at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, defensive countermeasures to the threats described above are emerging. For example, directed-energy weapons can enable the cost-effective intercept of certain types of munition. However, the incorporation of new modes of defence creates new requirements, both in relation to the size and power generation of platforms needed to defend an amphibious force, and for these platforms to be risked in forward positions. Moreover, the asymmetry of costs between missiles and vessels means that attackers enjoy more room for error and, in littoral areas, vessels can be struck by a range of both long- and short-ranged weapons, making it difficult to optimise against specific threats. Once ashore, concentrated force elements can be defended, but at increasingly high cost and for limited periods of time. While these challenges are not unique to littoral combat in every instance, the challenge of concentrating will be especially acute in the littoral context, given the vulnerability of a force when it is building up ashore, and the risks it faces if cut off from naval support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cumulatively, not only do these new threats make theatre entry increasingly difficult for amphibious forces, but they also increase the demand on the rest of the fleet and the wider joint force to provide protection. This will be an especially acute challenge when blue-water capabilities will have to operate at greater distances from coastlines and dedicate considerable effort to defending themselves and performing purely naval functions. The risk facing amphibious forces, then, is that the value of amphibious insertion comes to be seen as being outweighed by its costs and risks. Of course, there are a number of other roles that amphibious forces have come to play over the course of previous decades, but many of these do not depend on their amphibious roles per se.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for their specialism to continue delivering operational and strategic value, then, amphibious forces will need to adapt to this increasingly contested operating environment. This paper seeks to articulate an approach through which Western amphibious forces can continue to do so, in both alliance and coalition contexts. The paper’s key contention is that amphibious forces should act as an extension of the fleet, with their function being to enable two naval functions – strike and sea control. Rather than being a force projected by the fleet, amphibious forces should operate as an integral part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper’s proposition is that the amphibious forces most capable of supporting the fleet will be capable of delivering convergent effects from distributed positions. This requires lower force-to-space ratios, greater mobility on both sides of the littoral, and an emphasis on long-range fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 20th century, the primary mode of adaptation to increases in the range and lethality of weapons was to reduce force-to-space ratios. The most extreme example of this is non-state actors, who must contend with superior firepower and thus typically do not have force-to-space ratios over 10 fighters per square kilometre. Reducing these ratios, however, makes it difficult to concentrate forces for tactical effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way of addressing the challenge is for dispersed forces to coordinate long-range strikes. For example, infantry teams equipped with portable loitering munitions can concentrate fire to saturate specific high-value targets even where they are distributed over very broad frontages. Similarly, a system such as the US Marine Corps HIMARS can concentrate fire with munitions such as the 500 km-range precision-strike missile without being colocated. While the ability to bring a weight of fire upon opponents from dispersed positions is not a uniquely amphibious function, amphibious forces have two advantages in this field. First, their ability to operate both from land and from the maritime side of the littoral creates an expanded range of vectors from which amphibious forces can deliver fires. Integration with a maritime component command can also allow amphibious forces to draw on naval fires. Second, the relative mobility of amphibious forces can enable them to support fires with other functions, such as raiding at depths that other force elements cannot access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond strikes and raiding ashore, amphibious forces can also contribute to a range of maritime functions, including the exercise of sea control, and sea denial against adversary vessels in littoral waters. While amphibious forces already play a role in tasks such as interdiction and the generation of situational awareness, this role could be expanded if the force structure and capabilities of amphibious units were to make operating in close coordination with the fleet on both sides of the littoral into a core competency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One proposal of this paper is that amphibious forces can become more survivable and lethal by adopting a strike-centric concept of operations that emphasises better integration with fleets. The paper further argues that the adaptations required to enable such an approach, including an emphasis on multifunctional surface manoeuvre craft rather than on dedicated connectors, can also allow marine units to better contribute to missions on the maritime side of the littoral – such as the exercise of sea control, for example. This concept of operations implies a degree of specialisation that does entail a cost in terms of multifunctionality. However, an approach based on optimisation within the fleet can make amphibious forces more relevant to the most consequential challenges that Western nations may face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues outlined here will be central to the force transformation decisions of all European marine forces over the next decade. A key question for the Royal Marines specifically will be how the force model upon which its Future Commando Force programme (FCF) is based can deliver greatest value in an Allied context. The size of the Royal Marines means that the force will need to be configured to work with Allies and coalition partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is composed of five chapters. Chapter I outlines the traditional contributions of amphibious forces and their relevance to current UK national priorities. Chapter II summarises the challenges posed to forces’ effective operation by the contemporary operating environment. Chapter III articulates the case for what the authors see as the major adaptations that amphibious forces will need to make to be effective in this environment: becoming more focused on a strike-led concept of operations; and achieving greater integration with naval forces. Chapters IV and V examine the implications for the Royal Marines’ force design and capability needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methodologically, the paper is informed by a combination of a review of historical literature, operations analysis and insights from experimentation and exercises undertaken under the aegis of the Royal Marines’ FCF programme. An assessment of historical trends and patterns in the contemporary operating environment has been used to frame the paper’s discussion of how amphibious forces might contribute to the goals of a single state, alliance or coalition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-the-enduring-roles-of-amphibious-forces-and-their-application-to-uk-national-priorities&quot;&gt;I. The Enduring Roles of Amphibious Forces and Their Application to UK National Priorities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has historically been a strong case to be made for both the operational manoeuvrability and the strategic flexibility that amphibious forces offer policymakers. However, for these forces to continue to be tactically relevant, they will need to equip and operate in ways that differ considerably from current practice. Amphibious forces have in the past played a range of roles both above and below the threshold of high-intensity conflict. Below the threshold of conflict, their primary roles have included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signalling.&lt;/strong&gt; Amphibious capabilities can play a role in deterrent signalling. By virtue of the visibility of their supporting vessels, they represent a visible diplomatic signal. However, amphibious forces are scalable – a portion of a force can be deployed ashore while the rest remains offshore, for example. They can also be withdrawn from a theatre as diplomatic circumstances dictate, meaning that their deployment need not represent a commitment that is difficult to reverse. Scalability is important, as a key dimension of deterrence is that it must be balanced against efforts to mitigate misperception – an opponent should be able to distinguish between a deterrent threat and preparations for an attack. Moreover, the coordination of military means with diplomacy also necessitates the ability to demonstrate that a threat can be withdrawn if an opponent complies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presence in a theatre.&lt;/strong&gt; Amphibious forces have the capacity to remain engaged in a theatre over extended periods without drawing on local basing to the same degree as other capabilities. They can also, by virtue of their mobility, engage with multiple actors within a given theatre. The tasks they can perform in this capacity range from HADR (humanitarian assistance and disaster relief) activity to engaging local partners in advise-and-assist missions. In this capacity, they can contribute both to diplomatic influence and to what might be described as “general deterrence”, which denotes efforts to shape perceptions of a state’s commitment to an area, rather than a specific threat to dissuade a specific action.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In escalating crises and conflict, amphibious forces have historically played the following roles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid reaction to contingencies that develop outside the Euro-Atlantic area.&lt;/strong&gt; Examples include the early deployments of the US Marine Corps in Lebanon by the Eisenhower administration in 1958 and the early deployment of the Royal Marines’ 42 Commando into Kuwait in 1961 as part of Operation Vantage, a successful effort to forestall an Iraqi invasion. Early presence is often crucial, either for deterrence or, if deterrence fails, for setting the conditions for subsequent efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deception and operational dislocation.&lt;/strong&gt; The presence of amphibious forces can force the diversion of an opponent’s resources across multiple fronts. We might consider how, historically, British forces embarked in the Downs tied down a considerable Napoleonic army or – for a more recent example – how the afloat presence of the 4th and 5 th Marine Expeditionary Brigades were used to unhinge Iraqi defences during the 1991 Gulf War.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disruption.&lt;/strong&gt; The actions of commando units during the Second World War stand out as a particularly notable example.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Securing advanced bases or points of entry&lt;/strong&gt; for heavier forces to enter a theatre of combat – a role that became especially prominent for the US Marine Corps during the interwar years, and which may be one of the functions of the Marine Corps of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in a Taiwan contingency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there is a range of roles that marine units have played in both peacetime and conflict. Among these are tasks such as boarding and interdiction at sea, and the provision of niche capabilities such as riverine craft in support of joint activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conduct of operations and the tactics used to achieve objectives will be impacted by technological change, a subject that will be explored in more depth in subsequent chapters. However, this paper’s contention is that this will not fundamentally alter the roles of amphibious units as described. For example, the disruption of an opponent’s rear area by amphibious units posturing offshore could, in some cases, be achieved by these units launching loitering munitions from positions on or near the coast, rather than through infantry raids. Indeed, this would be desirable in many cases, given the risks posed to landing forces by A2/AD. However, the logic of disruption that would underly such an action would remain unaltered. The most significant changes would be at the level of equipment and tactics, rather than the underlying logic of employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While forces’ versatility to play the full gamut of the roles described above is desirable, delivering on national and Alliance-level priorities does entail emphasising some functions over others. The priorities identified in this paper are understood within the context of the UK’s Integrated Review (IR) and the Integrated Review Refresh, which identify Russia as the most acute threat to British national security, while acknowledging the reality of systemic competition with China and enduring risks in areas such as the Strait of Hormuz. With the specific roles that a state prioritises most heavily for its amphibious forces determined by the context in which they operate, this discussion focuses primarily on the strategic concerns of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the UK’s priorities will not align completely with those of allies and partners, they do overlap to a significant degree with those of other nations within NATO, and the rank ordering of priorities in the IR is also broadly mirrored in NATO’s Strategic Concept. This makes them a useful baseline for discussing the contexts in which other Western amphibious forces might also be employed. To be sure, concepts for utilising amphibious forces will not always converge across nations (though for scenarios such as those that trigger NATO Article V, alliance-level planning will introduce some coherence). One of the aims of this paper is to articulate an idea of how the UK’s amphibious forces might be used that can plausibly be aligned with the local circumstances of partner amphibious forces, based on the capabilities they either possess, or are planning to procure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three scenarios attendant on the list of priorities that emerged from the IR to which amphibious forces can be particularly relevant, and which therefore deserve particular attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dislocation and disruption&lt;/strong&gt; in the context of a regional war or an escalating “war in sight” crisis within Europe involving NATO and Russia – a low probability but high-impact scenario. Though not a main line of effort, amphibious capabilities can provide a level of mobility at both the tactical and operational levels. This can compel the dispersion of adversary capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expeditionary power projection.&lt;/strong&gt; This function will be of particular salience to interstate competition beyond Europe. Such competition will include elements of direct conflict, albeit at comparatively low levels of intensity. The ability to commit a unit of force alongside partner force elements that represents a meaningful contribution, but which is small enough to reflect the political constraints inherent in expeditionary activity, is an important tool when attempting to balance deterrence and escalation control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling sea control&lt;/strong&gt; in the context of either sub-threshold competition or an escalating crisis. This role can be relevant to both the European context and to theatres such as Hormuz.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of roles that amphibious forces can play. Rather, it outlines the contingencies where there appears to be an especially significant role that amphibious forces such as the Royal Marines can play in realising the aspirations set out in the IR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-crisis-or-conflict-in-europe&quot;&gt;A Crisis or Conflict in Europe&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, NATO’s deter and defend framework will depend in no small part on the ability to outmanoeuvre an opponent which, for all its deficiencies, has demonstrated an ability to sustain materiel and human attrition at a scale that NATO would struggle to match. Although bloodied by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, Russia is likely to reconstitute its forces over the medium term. Particularly when concentrated on a narrow front, the combination of Russia’s fires, its electronic warfare (EW) and air defences can pose a considerable challenge. Though Russia’s force is, in some respects, qualitatively degraded, the Russians have demonstrated the ability to combine smaller numbers of capable infantry with large numbers of more expendable forces in a force model that, while highly wasteful in both material and human terms, is effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At both the tactical and the operational level, the Concept for Deterrence and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area (DDA) seeks to overcome the challenge of mass through a series of integrated plans. One likely consequence of developing integrated regional plans is to force the commitment of Russian capabilities on multiple fronts in a way that prevents them from being concentrated to effect. Efforts to exacerbate Russia’s traditional weaknesses in the maritime domain can contribute to this. The country remains vulnerable to operational dislocation along an extended maritime periphery – something illustrated in historical conflicts such as the Crimean War and more recently, in the 1980s, when the US Reagan administration’s maritime strategy envisioned the aggressive use of Allied naval and amphibious power in the High North and Soviet Far East to draw Soviet ground and air forces away from the central front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Russia can be faced with similar challenges on its northern flank, where the Alliance’s borders place key Russian facilities, such as Murmansk, within reach of long-range precision fires. This could exert an indirect influence on other parts of the Alliance’s eastern flank. In the context of an escalating crisis in a region such as the Baltic, the posturing of amphibious forces on NATO’s northern frontier, coordinated with activity by other force elements on other fronts as envisioned by the DDA, would impose multiple operational dilemmas on Russia. At a minimum, a decision to posture amphibious units this way would force the diversion of air assets, defensive SAM systems and some of Russia’s best assault troops from the VDV and 200th Arctic Brigade, which are largely responsible for cold-weather operations, from other theatres. The requirement to resource multiple fronts concurrently could contribute to the objective of denial by preventing Russian planners from believing that they can concentrate enough force on any one front to achieve meaningful strategic effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the vanguard element of a larger force, the Royal Marines would not be the biggest element in any force engaged in such an operation – allowing the Alliance to signal deterrent, as opposed to offensive, intent. The marines could arrive and go emissions dark, leaving Russian planners guessing both their ultimate goals and whether or not they were the vanguard element of a larger force such as a US Marine Corps Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF). Uncertainty about the Alliance’s force dispositions could impose considerable demands in terms of surveillance and conventional hedging. Notably, this was crucial to deterrence vis-á-vis the Soviet Union. Routine carrier deployments to the High North had limited effect until the exercise Ocean Venture, in which Soviet planners recognised they were not able to spot NATO carrier strike groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, an escalatory dimension to any such deployment near Russia’s nuclear bastions. However, an advantage of an amphibious vanguard component is that it would not pose an imminent threat to the Kola Peninsula (which hosts critical Russian naval and nuclear infrastructure) by itself, but could be the forward element of a force that could do so – it would be large enough to draw resources, but need not incur inadvertent escalation. Amphibious forces played a similar role in the context of NATO’s maritime strategy in the 1980s – though without the reach to be an operationally significant threat in their own right, as modern strike-enabled forces can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the diversion of Russian forces at the operational level, mobile forces can exacerbate Russian weaknesses with respect to dynamic targeting at the tactical level. As an example of this, we might consider the difficulty Russia had sinking Ukraine’s last warship, the Yuri Olefirenko, while the vessel was at sea. Though Russia’s targeting system can be formidable, it is at its most dangerous when many sensors can be concentrated on a narrow sector. Expanding the geography Russian forces must survey by conducting offensive manoeuvre from the littorals can place Russian forces at a disadvantage. Consider, for example, that the landmass of a nation such as Norway increases by 20% when islets and not only the mainland are included. Similarly, Estonia has 2,222 islands. Forces operating from offshore islands could disrupt the rear of a Russian advance using long-range precision fires, large numbers of containerised loitering munitions, or infantry raids inland. In theatres where narrow frontages can be saturated by adversary UAVs and ISR assets, exploiting this manoeuvre space can substantially expand the area an opponent must survey, and prevent an adversary system such as a Russian reconnaissance fire complex from operating as intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expeditionary-power-projection&quot;&gt;Expeditionary Power Projection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area in which amphibious forces such as the Royal Marines would likely be expected to deliver value is expeditionary operations at reach. Such operations will, with some exceptions, be of a lower intensity than those within the NATO Area of Responsibility and will involve more limited political commitment. The unit of force likely to be committed by a nation such as the UK will, then, only be strategically effective in tandem with either a coalition or local partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alliance must hedge against the possibility that, much like the Cold War, contemporary interstate competition will occur short of open war at high intensity, because the risks of a direct large-scale war are too substantial for both sides. Though not as immediately consequential as a direct great power clash, the cumulative effects of persistent competition and conflict can be considerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, we might consider the risks to sea lines of communication (SLOCs) upon which both the inputs that sustain both the defence industry and Western trade in general depend. Many geographically crucial SLOCs, including Hormuz and the Bab el Mandeb, are flanked either by hostile powers such as Iran, or by fragile states in which internal instability can intersect with great power competition. Opponents such as Russia and Iran have proven capable of leveraging internecine conflicts in Libya, Syria and Yemen to good effect to create strategic bastions along key SLOCs, and develop leverage over regional actors such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. Not only does this pose a challenge to economically vital SLOCs, it can also threaten the flows of inputs such as microelectronics and explosive charges upon which European defence industries depend. The need to pre-empt further losses in key areas makes the ability to respond rapidly to an evolving crisis beyond Europe a priority, one which will indirectly impact the security of Europe itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional functions of amphibious forces can be of relevance in such contexts. The deployment of units can generate early presence to both signal intent and deter intervention by a rival third party. Once in theatre, amphibious forces can perform a number of functions, including supporting partner forces in seizing military objectives; and enabling theatre entry by heavier forces by securing sea ports of debarkation (SPODs), and conducting raids against A2/AD capabilities to secure theatre access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sea-control-missions-within-the-nato-area-of-responsibility-and-beyond&quot;&gt;Sea Control Missions Within the NATO Area of Responsibility and Beyond&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amphibious forces can contribute to efforts to secure sea control in several ways. First, they can provide the fleet with additional ISR capabilities, and the capability to interdict hostile shipping. In peacetime competition this function will be of particular importance against opponents who may conduct activities such as minelaying or maritime sabotage using auxiliary vessels, as it will be vital to prove that a given vessel was involved in malign activity. As cases such as US special forces’ seizure of the clandestine Iranian minelayer Iran Ajr illustrate, this requires vessels defended by armed crews to be seized, rather than sunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is nothing especially novel about the use of capabilities such as auxiliary vessels for tasks such as minelaying and sabotage, the range of targets that can be affected by such activities is expanding, partly as a function of the growing reliance of nations on coastal and subsurface critical infrastructure. For example, while transoceanic cables have always been a chokepoint in global communications, their centrality has grown in line with states’ reliance on the internet. Moreover, the range of tools with which opponents can impact critical infrastructure is growing – a uncrewed underwater vessel (UUV) such as the Russian Harpsichord, for example, can be operated from a range of vessels to conduct either surveillance or sabotage. Crucially, the ability to prevent clandestine sabotage will be important not only to protect critical infrastructure, but also to prevent an opponent from conducting shaping operations in an area such as the Baltic Sea or the Strait of Hormuz, should a crisis in one of these sites escalate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to interdiction and boarding vessels, the capabilities that support marine forces can also support tasks such as generating situational awareness and preventing interdictions by hostile naval vessels. For example, we might consider how SOCOM (US Special Operations Command) used the Hercules and Wimbrown, two converted vessels used as sea bases, to counter Iranian small-boat swarms during the Iran–Iraq war. In the context of conflict in a region such as the Persian Gulf, amphibious forces can support sea control by generating situational awareness about threats to vessels at sea and conducting raids to eliminate anti-access threats to vessels at sea such as coastal defence cruise missiles. Amphibious capabilities should be considered for tasks of surveillance and presence, rather than simply insertion. Such usage better reflects the range of functions – including boarding – that these forces offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-a-new-operating-environment-the-need-for-change&quot;&gt;II. A New Operating Environment: The Need for Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For marine forces to achieve any of the functions discussed in Chapter I under current and likely future operating conditions will require a radical change to the way these forces are structured and, in particular, greater integration between them and blue-water assets. To an extent, this change is already underway across several Western militaries. What the scope and degree of integration between naval and amphibious forces remains, however, the subject of some debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges-to-theatre-entry&quot;&gt;Challenges to Theatre Entry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent history, amphibious forces have been both the beneficiaries of sea control, and a means of exploiting it to strategic effect. Once a navy secured littoral waters, amphibious forces were inserted and typically benefited from support from the sea in the form of sustainment and air support. However, in many contemporary contexts, the fleet is likely to have to fight to enter a theatre and cannot loiter near hostile shores for long. This challenge will be especially acute against a peer competitor such as Russia, but will hold even against sub-peer opponents, as illustrated by events such as Ukraine’s sinking of the Russian flagship Moskva and the possession of anti-ship missile batteries by both the Houthis and Hizbullah. This is not to say that operating in a threat envelope is impossible – solutions exist for each challenge, including EW, shipboard air defences and a growing suite of counter-UAV measures. However, it will not always be possible for fleets to loiter offshore in support of marine forces for extended periods. Instead, until adversary sensors and effectors have been considerably degraded, amphibious forces will need to be able to both fight and deliver effects inland under the assumption that support from the fleet is intermittent, rather than persistent. If postured for deterrence by denial, amphibious forces will find themselves operating under these conditions for considerable periods – though in the later stages of a conflict they may enjoy more unfettered freedom of movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once forces are disembarked, amphibious forces’ lodgements ashore will be at considerable risk, and the operational pauses needed to build up capabilities will likely prove fatal. A range of capabilities, including tactical ballistic missiles, artillery UAVs and glider-equipped unguided bombs, such as the Russian FAB-500, launched from fixed-wing aircraft, will threaten disembarked forces. Of course the risk posed by operational pauses has long been a persistent feature of amphibious campaigns. But the diversification of air and missile threats will make protecting a lodgement even more difficult than it has been previously. Beyond Europe, the proliferation of strike capabilities would create a similar, though less sophisticated, set of challenges. The gulf between the types of capability needed to defeat peers and sub-peers is narrowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key question for amphibious forces will be how to deliver tactical and operational effects when achieving the force-to-space ratios needed to do so is very difficult, and the mechanisms that support these forces ashore and afloat are held at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;changing-coastal-geography&quot;&gt;Changing Coastal Geography&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many environments in which expeditionary activity is likely to be conducted will also be shaped by another trend – the urbanisation of coastal areas. As of 2030, roughly 60% of the world’s population will live in cities, many of which will be coastal. Moreover, urban area coverage has outstripped population growth, implying that considerable stretches of many coastlines will be urbanised. As illustrated by the prominence of cities such as Aden, Marawi and Mocimboa da Praia in recent conflicts, battles within coastal conurbations will be a major feature of littoral combat. This is noteworthy because urban warfare often requires considerable amounts of manpower to hold ground, as well as the expenditure of small-arms ammunition at rates that exceed consumption in open terrain by several orders of magnitude. Such conditions will pose an especially acute challenge to size-restricted light expeditionary forces, and to Western nations that must balance the requirements of deterrence in theatres such as Europe with the need to project power. The challenge will be compounded by adversary efforts to shield key capabilities from the effects of Western airpower by using palliatives such as underground tunnels – something that can be seen in both urban terrain and in fortifications such as those Iran has constructed in the Tartus mountains. The basic challenge that expeditionary forces will face is finding a way to deliver policy imperatives such as providing value to local partners with comparatively small forces while operating in terrain that requires considerable commitments, in terms of munitions and manpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resource-burdens-on-fleets&quot;&gt;Resource Burdens on Fleets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolving nature of sub-threshold threats at sea will require greater levels of persistent presence. While this is a naval challenge, rather than one that applies specifically to marines, it has an indirect effect, both on tasks such as maritime boarding and on the availability of hulls from the wider fleet to support amphibious forces. To justify the dedication of naval vessels to support amphibious warfare, the conduct of amphibious operations must come to more fully embrace tasks that support sea control. Marines already support sea control through activities such as interdiction, but there are broader contributions to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, the risk to amphibious forces in the emerging operating environment is threefold. First, they will face challenges in areas such as theatre entry and sustainment in likely combat environments. These challenges, while not unique to amphibious operations, will impose considerable burdens upon these forces. Second, they must be able to impact events in theatres such as urban environments that typically demand more manpower than expeditionary forces can expect to have at hand. The final risk is an organisational one – that the resource burden of inserting forces into a theatre and subsequently sustaining them exceeds the value they provide to the wider joint force, and to blue-water navies in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this paper describes ways that amphibious forces can address these challenges such that they can continue to contribute to Allied security in the ways that they historically have done. It also addresses the specific capability niches that the UK’s Commando Force can fill in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-new-approaches&quot;&gt;III. New Approaches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous chapters have discussed the potential roles that amphibious forces can play in the context of UK and Allied national security objectives, and the operational impediments to their accomplishment. This chapter sets out the case for the paper’s key argument, that to retain their utility to the wider joint force, amphibious operations in contested environments should be subsumed under two doctrinal naval functions – strike and securing sea control. It also connects this argument to the strategic objectives outlined in Chapter I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges to amphibious power projection described in the previous chapter have been incipient for some time, and a variety of solutions have been proposed to mitigate them. Broadly speaking, these solutions may be grouped into three categories which, while not exhaustive, capture the major areas of focus with respect to operations in contested environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approaches that depend on distributing the force across a broad front, maintaining a high operational tempo and manoeuvring towards operational objectives, while bypassing adversary concentrations to the extent possible. This approach is captured by concepts such as the US Marine Corps’ Operational Manoeuvre from the Sea (OMFTS), but early traces of it can be seen in historical amphibious operations such as the Japanese assault on Malaya in the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strike-centric concepts that envision delivering convergent effects with distributed forces equipped with long-range fires. This is arguably a partial description of the primary focus of the US Marine Corps’ Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations framework, although the concept also embraces tasks such as supporting naval forces from offshore positions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A shift in focus towards raiding and unconventional operations in a Tier 2 special forces role.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concepts such as the direct assault and seizure of ports, which are still seriously considered by many nations, including China, are excluded here on the grounds that direct assault to seize and hold heavily defended high-value targets is likely to entail a degree of attrition that no Western force will tolerate. For a contemporary example of a state operationalising such a concept, see, for example, the VDV’s assault on Hostomel airport in February 2022. While there are differences between amphibious and airborne assault, both rely to a considerable extent on airborne insertion. Amphibious forces might be better supported by airpower and naval support, but would still face the challenge of being a concentrated target against which a range of capabilities could be concentrated – much as the VDV was at Hostomel. The seizure and subsequent defence of SPODs may be an ultimate objective of amphibious insertion, but direct assault would seem an unlikely approach in most cases where credible resistance is likely to be encountered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the three approaches described articulates part of a potential solution to some of the challenges outlined in Chapter II. However, it is this paper’s contention that they are individually incomplete. High-tempo dispersed operations comparable to those envisioned under OMFTS can succeed in discovering, creating and exploiting weaknesses within an opponent’s defensive lines. The distribution of forces can deny an opponent an obvious point at which to concentrate defences, and can enable infiltration. Combined with longer-range means of theatre entry such as long-range surface connectors and vertical lift solutions, this can force an opponent to thin out defences and spread ISR capabilities over wider areas, thereby contributing to mitigating the risk from A2/AD capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the history of distributed assault suggests that avoiding strongpoints may not always be possible – meaning that a force needs to be capable of reducing those strongpoints it does encounter. This creates a trade-off – a force sufficiently large to overcome serious resistance has traditionally required things such as a headquarters and organic artillery and armour. This, however, undermines the principle of low force densities central to such concepts. Notably, this appears to be a challenge that the PLA’s marine corps is facing, with its combined arms battalions that operate on a model comparable to OMFTS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distribution of long-range precision fires in littoral areas including offshore islands, and amphibious vessels as envisioned under concepts such as Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations, can help resolve some of the trade-offs between lethality and dispersion. Long-range precision fires can allow a convergence of effect to be achieved by dispersed forces which, by virtue of operating offshore, do not face some of the challenges that manoeuvring inland entails. However, the challenge that such an approach would face is cross-regional applicability. Strike-centric forces distributed on offshore islands have obvious utility in a theatre such as the First Island Chain, where their main function is sea denial against an opponent such as the PLA Navy. But this approach has been challenged on the basis that there is applicability for strike-centric concepts to missions other than sea denial, particularly in theatres where many important targets are likely to be on the ground, and concealed within complex terrain-challenge sets that have historically necessitated combined arms approaches. These latter target sets have historically necessitated the ability to conduct a close fight with the opponent on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a special-forces-driven model can deliver value in a number of areas, including human intelligence and preparation of the battlefield. Additionally, functions such as raiding can limit some of the risks posed by A2/AD capabilities by limiting the size of forces inserted and their signatures. However, to be effective, raiding and other special forces activities must be integrated with a wider joint effort – they can rarely, if ever, deliver meaningful effects in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three broad approaches outlined above can be mutually reinforcing, rather than mutually exclusive. Distributed ranged fires capabilities positioned offshore on islands, amphibious vessels and auxiliaries can provide dispersed forces ashore with the fire support needed to eliminate concentrations of adversary forces, without these forces needing to be so large that they require an operational pause, headquarters and additional enablers. In turn, distributed forces ashore act both as an ISR screen for offshore fires and as a raiding force that compels adversary targets to move, unmask or concentrate for protection in ways that create vulnerabilities to offshore fires. Supported by offshore fires, comparatively light forces can also concentrate to perform tasks such as assaulting adversary strongpoints or defending SPODs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This discussion illustrates that there is a symbiotic link between strike-centric concepts and manoeuvre inland from the sea. Thus, while amphibious power projection and maritime strike have historically been doctrinally separated, this paper argues that they should now converge. Such convergence can be of importance to blue-water navies, which presently face limitations in their offensive strike capacity relative to the number of potential missions they face both at sea and on land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key way that amphibious forces can be better integrated with core naval tasks is by generating presence and situational awareness at sea. Many of the enablers needed to underpin a strike-centric concept of power projection can – as will be discussed below – also enable marines to contribute capacity to sea control missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of being viewed as a distinct maritime function, then, amphibious power projection should be subsumed under the rubric of strike and sea control – which would entail greater conceptual and functional integration with blue-water navies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections will articulate the key lines of effort that will be needed in order to realise the conceptual framework that has been described thus far. Broadly speaking, there are three lines of operational effort: a focus on sea control, archipelagic operations, and the enabling of partner forces. Success in delivering these priorities will be determined by the ability of marines to both generate fires and help the fleet win superior situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fires&quot;&gt;Fires&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-range strike could be provided by ground-based fires distributed on the littoral, but could also be delivered directly from the sea if enabled by a shift in the design principles that underpin surface connectors and enabling vessels towards a model that emphasised strike. Specifically, we might consider vessels such as the Chinese Type-22 catamaran, which can launch C-802 cruise missiles, or the British-designed Bladerunner, which is used as a missile launcher and more recently an air defence platform by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Such vessels are comparable in size to both existing surface connectors and ones envisioned under future programmes, and even when equipped with missiles are generally cost effective (a Type-22, for example, costs $13 million). A shift in design philosophy from boats dedicated to moving marines ashore to more multifunctional vessels capable of operating on and striking from the maritime part of the littoral could significantly enhance the strike capabilities of marine units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent experiments have also demonstrated that systems such as HIMARS can be used from the decks of amphibious vessels. While risking dedicated shipping would likely be unacceptably hazardous, it might be more acceptable to launch containerised munitions from auxiliary vessels. As seen during conflicts such as the Falklands War, non-military shipping can be repurposed. Coupled with trends towards the containerisation of both munitions and communications nodes, this could enable auxiliary assets to be used as mobile fires platforms in a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-dispersed-contact-layer&quot;&gt;A Dispersed Contact Layer&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dispersed forward elements capable of tasks such as assessing an opponent’s pattern of life and identifying elusive targets, and of passing data to strike assets via shared datalinks and network protocols, can more easily cue in fires if these forces have the tools to generate situational awareness in forward positions. Forward elements can deepen situational awareness, both through technical means such as deploying UAVs, and by interacting with partner forces. As an example of the former method, we might consider how Russian forces have employed complexes of three short-ranged Orlan-10 UAVs equipped respectively with EW, optical/designator and communications relay payloads to stimulate Ukrainian SAM radars, degrade them and designate them for strikes by networked artillery and long-range missile units. Evidence from exercises such as Green Dagger has shown that such forces can also disrupt adversaries in ways that force them to concentrate capabilities to counter raiders, in so doing becoming vulnerable to offshore strike platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of a dispersed contact layer to enable counter scouting is not exclusive to maritime operations. However, it has a particular salience in this context because the ability to move along multiple axes on the littoral (either by land, by sea or through the air) creates an expanded set of avenues for disruption by amphibious force elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;archipelagic-warfare&quot;&gt;Archipelagic Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greater integration of amphibious forces with UK and Allied fleets, particularly in missions in narrow seas such as the Baltic, necessitates a focus on operating within and from archipelagos. Narrow archipelagic waterways often possess distinctive climatic conditions. For example, in the case of the Baltic Sea, fog is a frequent feature of the environment on a year-round basis, complicating the use of some sensors, such as electro-optical sensors. Similarly, water temperatures relative to the air can cause either subrefraction of radar waves, limiting the range of radar, or super refraction, which makes radar more sensitive to clutter. Force concealment can leverage these conditions based on local circumstances. While it is never possible to defeat the full spectrum of sensors that an opponent can aggregate, making use of climatic features to limit the effectiveness of some sensors can simplify the task of overcoming others. For example, if radar is subject to subrefraction, cueing sensors with a narrower field of view, such as electro-optical or infrared sensors, becomes more difficult. Moreover, knowing that specific sensor types represent a primary threat vector because others will be compromised by the climate can provide the focus for efforts at tactical deception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archipelagic contexts tend to enable smaller vessels to hide within clutter, particularly in crowded waters such as the Baltic. The navies of Baltic states have historically relied upon this when preparing for sea denial missions against a stronger Russian navy, as has the Norwegian navy in the north. It is possible, given the comparative weakness of the Russian surface fleet, that assets such as missile boats built for sea denial can be repurposed for sea control or projection inland. If this is the case, Allied marine units can usefully integrate with littoral-focused navies – using their platforms as launch pads for activity and strike assets, while making them more lethal against ground targets by providing them with situational awareness inland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geography of archipelagic contexts also lends itself to the distribution of long-ranged precision fires, something which is central to concepts such as Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations. This dynamic can also be applicable in a European context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sea-control&quot;&gt;Sea Control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, the requirement to support the gaining and exercise of sea control at sea will remain, but the relevance of marines to this task can grow. There will be a greater requirement for multifunctionality in areas such as surface connector design, since numbers of hulls have shrunk relative to historical force structures across Western navies (though this trend may be starting to reverse). Western navies will, for a time at least, operate with fewer hulls, even as they face a growing imperative to meet persistent challenges, including the use of auxiliary vessels by rivals for tasks such as challenging freedom of navigation and coercive signalling near critical infrastructure. There is no single solution to these challenges, but one dimension of a solution set would be to expand the capability of marine forces to provide sensor coverage and the ability to act at sea. Dedicated and auxiliary amphibious platforms have demonstrated the ability to cover wide areas using vertical lift capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than being an auxiliary role, this can be a core function. Teaming existing vertical lift assets with unmanned platforms that have greater endurance could enhance this potential for a single hull to generate both presence and wide area coverage. Moreover, a shift in the design principles that determine which types of surface platforms are launched from amphibious vessels, towards an emphasis on surface manoeuvre, as opposed to ship-to-shore movement of heavy equipment, can yield amphibious capabilities that provide wide area coverage and can thus support the fleet, rather than being specialised purely for insertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;local-force-partnering&quot;&gt;Local Force Partnering&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, many of the contexts in which the UK may wish to achieve strategic effects at expeditionary reach may be urban environments. Amphibious forces will therefore need to reconcile their often limited size with the need to support expeditionary missions that will necessarily involve an urban component. While amphibious forces will likely not have the mass to conduct urban assaults, they can fulfil niche roles within them. A strike-centric concept of operations can have relevance both in high-intensity scenarios and in lower intensity expeditionary activity in complex terrain. It is likely that, given the forces required for urban fighting, the latter form of activity will almost always be undertaken alongside a local partner – this has been the case not only in recent urban battles in which Western forces were involved, such as Mosul, but also in many of the battles fought by non-Western militaries at expeditionary reach. Examples of the latter include the UAE’s role in the Battle of Aden, and the Russian role in Aleppo. In such contexts, the challenge is not necessarily providing partners with infantry or munitions, which local partners often have, but rather with offering niche capabilities, including the precision-strike capabilities needed to engage elusive and buried high-value targets, reduce fortified positions and disperse concentrations of adversary forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges of operating within complex terrain, however, mean that the use of strike capabilities will often require forces postured forward to build pattern-of-life assessments, cue in fires and directly engage targets that cannot readily be struck from offshore. Given that engagement opportunities will be intermittent, such operations will also require fires platforms that can remain in theatre on a more persistent basis than fast air assets. Finally, a network of relationships with likely local partner forces will need to be generated – something that can be facilitated by engagement in peacetime. The potential sensitivities involved in engaging some partners creates a role for special-forces-capable elements of an amphibious force, as these force elements offer policymakers somewhat more flexibility of deployment in theatre, relative to conventional units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-the-royal-marines-specialisation-and-force-design&quot;&gt;IV. The Royal Marines: Specialisation and Force Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having set out in the previous chapter ways in which forces can adapt to meet the challenges posed by the emerging operating environment, this chapter focuses on the particular role of the Royal Marines within the amphibious constructs described. Size and budget constraints are likely to mean that the marines will not be able to deliver the full spectrum of capabilities needed to enable a strike-centric concept of amphibious operations or operations in support of sea control at scale. However, the UK’s marines can perform niche roles within an allied amphibious construct centred on strike and sea control. At a smaller scale, it may also be possible for the Royal Marines to deliver strike and sea control on a self-contained basis for a time, to enable theatre entry by a heavier element of the joint force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of Western marine forces are developing capabilities that can support a strike-led approach to power projection from the littoral. The most notable example of this comes from the US Marine Corps, whose Force Design 2030 heavily emphasises long-range strike capabilities. Some European marine forces, such as the Swedish marines, also appear to be prioritising the ability to generate fires from littoral areas, through capabilities such as mortar boats equipped with NEMO mortar. Moreover, a number of European navies are optimised to operate in littoral spaces. Forces such as the Swedish and Finnish navies, which were built around smaller vessels such as the Hamina-class missile-equipped fast-attack craft and the Swedish Visby-class corvette, procured for the probably now redundant task of sea denial against the Russian fleet in the Baltic (which would likely not be survivable beyond the early stages of a conflict), could readily be repurposed to generate offensive fires from Baltic littorals using the same low-observable fast-attack craft and corvettes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the number of missiles a vessel such as the Visby-class corvette can carry is limited (the Visby-class has capacity for eight RB-15 surface-to-surface missiles), it is worth noting that, cumulatively, the countries of the Baltic are poised to possess a considerable force of small combatant vessels, including 13 Visby- and Hamina-class vessels (and their successor classes) that can theoretically carry a collective throw weight of 72 RB-15 and Gabriel dual-use missiles. With the presence of the Swedish marines in the Baltic, and Poland due to purchase the dual-capable naval strike missile for its coastal defences, plus Germany, which intends to equip its sea battalion with a long-range strike capability, also in possession of the NSM, ground-based fires in this region, along with the maritime assets detailed above, represent a considerable locally available long-range strike capability, comparable in many ways to that fielded by an individual MEF. Surface manoeuvre craft supporting the Royal Marines that are capable of carrying strike capabilities such as long-range loitering munitions could augment this strike capability in the littorals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s successful use of Neptune Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles against high-value targets such as an S-400 and a Kilo-class submarine illustrates how such strike capabilities can pose a considerable threat to the limited number of operationally critical assets upon which a Russian ground force depends. Of course, cohering these capabilities into a single concept of operations in littoral spaces depends on Allied agreement – something that can be pursued through engagement, both bilaterally and through frameworks such as the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF). However, it is likely that the components of a distributed force capable of inland strike from the Baltic littorals exists in principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There exist, then, a number of prospective partners with whom the Royal Marines can interoperate to generate strike from littoral areas. The most important area that the Royal Marines can most readily support such forces within the confines of the model we describe is – should Allies accept it – by providing a forward-postured reconnaissance and raiding force that operates inland ahead of the offshore striking component. The function of such a force would not be to conduct raiding as an independent strategic function (as was the case during the Second World War), but rather to enable the strike capabilities held by Allies. They can achieve this in two ways: generate the situational awareness inland needed to enable strikes from the maritime vector; penalise the dispersion of adversary high-value targets through direct attack – in turn forcing the concentration of assets in ways that makes them vulnerable to strikes (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;helping-the-fleet-to-out-scout-an-opponent&quot;&gt;Helping the Fleet to Out-Scout an Opponent&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ISR Gathering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forward-posture reconnaissance elements can complement wider efforts to generate situational awareness regarding complex target sets using capabilities such as UAVs, but they can also deliver awareness in ways that cannot be achieved from stand-off positions. For example, Israeli commandos routinely tapped the fibre optic cables underpinning Hizbullah’s firing positions in southern Lebanon – delivering access to a system that UAVs could not compromise. In Vietnam, the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group performed a similar function by placing sensors around the Ho Chi Minh Trail. In the context of a future battlefield that operates at machine speed, physically forward human operators can also play an important role in battle damage assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the inherent physical trade-offs involved in building ISR systems such as UAVs mean that they will often trade range for things such as sensor payload, except in the case of large and very expensive unmanned combat aerial vehicles. It is likely, then, that UAVs with sophisticated multispectral payloads will need to be launched at relative proximity to their targets – creating a role for forward-deployed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battle Damage Assessment and Counter Deception&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As methods of surveillance evolve, forward-positioned forces can also play an important role in the verification of target data, and course correction in the face of adversary deception. Surveillance enabled by computer vision can be confounded by data poisoning – the act of making AI misclassify an object by slightly modifying its physical appearance. Learning when this is occurring will require data to be gathered from within an opponent’s controlled areas by forces that can visually identify patterns of adversary deception. This is a role that “Tier 2” special forces – those certified as special forces for the purposes of special operations – can play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;command-and-control&quot;&gt;Command and Control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dedicated shipping that supports forward deployed amphibious forces can play an important role as a command node. Though vessel size can be a vulnerability, it also underpins key functions. Considerable size and power generation is required, both to underpin the processing power needed to receive and translate multiple feeds, including those from forward-deployed elements, and to then distribute data across the force. A command vessel would need to loiter more than 400 km from hostile shores to avoid coastal defence cruise missiles such as the Russian P-800. It would, moreover, need protection against longer-ranged threats, such as bombers. However, it would still be less vulnerable than an immobile ground-based headquarters, which can be struck by a range of land-attack missiles, and which would not present opponents with a dynamic target. The risk to static command nodes has been illustrated by the effective use of Storm Shadow missiles against Russian command nodes in Ukraine. Maritime headquarters can – all other things being equal – co-locate more personnel and processing power at lower risk than can comparable ground-based headquarters, though they do not operate without risk. The relative proximity at which this shipping can operate – even when the need to avoid A2/AD capabilities is factored in – in addition to its size, mobility and organic protection, makes such shipping a useful node for the coordination of ISR and fires without requiring reach-back to C2 nodes in the homebase. In the medium to long term, improvements in processing power may enable resilient communications across self-forming networks of capabilities in littoral spaces, underpinned by systems such as those envisioned by DARPA’s DYNAMO and STITCHES programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;raiding&quot;&gt;Raiding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to their ability to support the gathering of ISR data, raiding by distributed forces can also complicate adversary efforts at concealment. Historically, concealment has depended on cover and dispersion. However, dispersion makes a force vulnerable to raiding, while concentrating to overcome raiders makes forces vulnerable to strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While special forces operating in a reconnaissance and raiding function have sometimes struggled in contexts such as the 1991 Gulf War, there are some reasons to believe they might fare differently under emerging circumstances. First, light UAVs that can be transported by forward-positioned teams can considerably expand the area that any given team can survey and conduct attacks on. Secondly, a new generation of lightweight vehicles equipped with tactical strike capabilities can provide forward-deployed forces with a degree of survivability against well-armed opponents when they encounter them. For example, we might consider the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, which is being equipped by SOCOM with a spike anti-tank guided missile. Third, open-architecture C4ISR processing systems such as the Royal Marines’ Project EVE can enable data from the wider joint force to be leveraged by forward-deployed elements through software integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, while it should be assumed that forward-deployed forces will operate under information denial and with only intermittent access to wider joint force networks, all of the above mean that these forces will have a degree of situational awareness that exceeds that of similar forces deployed under comparable circumstances in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-future-force-design-for-the-royal-marines&quot;&gt;A Future Force Design for the Royal Marines&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Marines is an organisation that has long viewed the ability to force-generate small units capable of operating with minimal support as a core competency. As such, it would be well suited to the roles outlined above. However, this would require a shift from the existing model of deploying commando companies. The core conclusion from internal work conducted by the Royal Marines and supported by external bodies (including experimentation, wargaming and exercises) is that a redesigned commando force built to operate as a forward screen for offshore strike elements would have, as its primary unit of force, a 12-person strike company. The order of battle of such a force would be structured as shown in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a force differs from the existing Royal Marine force design in that it implies a transition away from commando companies operating as aggregated light infantry units that can be treated as interoperable with their ground-based counterparts (as was the case in Korea and, more recently, in Afghanistan and Iraq). Divided into strike teams of 12 individuals, the proposed force has been tested over areas spanning 40 x 30 km – implying a force-to-space ratio comparable to the average insurgent force. Its organic vehicles, such as the MRZR, also reflect an emphasis on mobility over carrying capacity. This represents a considerable shift, which necessarily means deemphasising functions such as holding and patrolling ground, to enable the force to optimise for tasks such as strike and raiding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enabling Strike&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model would see the Royal Marines often acting as a source of information to cue fires generated by partner forces or the wider joint force. To illustrate, wargaming has seen the Royal Marines operate ahead of a notional II MEF ground component comprised of two marine infantry battalions and two artillery batteries comprised of M777 and HIMARS units, along with NMESIS, which has both an anti-ship and a land attack capability. Alternatively, the marines could operate as the forward element of a littoral fires capability generated by JEF partners in a region such as the Baltic Sea. In each instance, the function of the force would be to enable and support strike-heavy partners, while deemphasising seizing or holding ground in most instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jXYFYOv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: The Organisation of an Individual Littoral Response Group, as Part of a Wider Littoral Strike Group.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of the envisioned ground component has an impact on the maritime force supporting insertion and subsequent operations. The reduction of the size of individual strike teams has an indirect effect on methods of insertion. Smaller teams can be inserted using a range of mechanisms, including submersible craft. This potentially obviates challenges such as the threat of UAVs near contested shores. Moreover, a reduction in the amount of heavy equipment that needs to be moved from ship to shore can enable surface manoeuvre craft to be optimised to meet other demands, such as maintaining a low observable profile and carrying fires to support the disembarked force. This will be crucial given that the force will depend on surface manoeuvre craft (as well as on Allied fires) for much of its ability to generate lethality against concentrated targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surface Manoeuvre&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A different approach to surface manoeuvre that emphasised longer-ranged and more complex platforms than the connectors currently used could also see the marines generate their own organic fires from littoral spaces. In the same way that complex warships are increasingly being built with modularity at their core, surface manoeuvre platforms could be built to operate either as connectors, or as launch pads for artillery or loitering munitions or C-UAS (counter-uncrewed aerial systems) platforms, or else as hosts for EW decoys. As illustrated by Iran, which has placed a range of effectors such as SAM systems and anti-ship missiles on relatively cheap Bladerunner boats, this can be achieved at low cost. Uncrewed or optionally crewed solutions can also support such functions. The major trade-off here is between range and weight – relatively small vessels can carry both personnel and effectors comfortably but would struggle to move heavy vehicles. If the insertion requirement is for small teams of infantry and relatively light vehicles, this can allow for manoeuvre vessels with longer ranges and lower signatures, without creating unviable requirements in terms of size and cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, there is a symbiotic link between transitioning to a distributed and strike-centric force ashore and supporting functions such as sea control on the maritime side of the littoral. To the extent that the force becomes more distributed, the surface craft that support it can be designed in ways that allow them to be more multifunctional, as they do not need to insert and then sustain an aggregated brigade and its enablers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-commando-force-model-in-practice&quot;&gt;The Commando Force Model in Practice&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The force design described above would see the marines shift from being a multifunctional force capable of acting as auxiliary light infantry to being a more specialised force which, while deployable in multiple contexts, would deliver value primarily by optimising for specific niche tactical roles. Lethality against high-value targets and the enablement of fires would supersede holding ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There exists a body of empirical evidence drawn from exercises and wargaming to validate the force model described above. Royal Navy-led force development has included wargaming, live exercising, threat analysis and modelling, and studies of similar force models. Two deductions have emerged from this process. The first is that the commando force model, if equipped, organised and trained as proposed above, can achieve the range of tactical actions and operational effects that this paper calls for littoral forces to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One illustration of this comes from Exercise Green Dagger, in which UK commando forces operating against larger US Marine Corps formations in repeated large-scale exercises had a disruptive effect in excess of what one would expect from a battalion-sized force operating against brigade formations. 40 Commando was divided up into 12-person strike teams that operated ahead of a light defensive screen. The presence of distributed raiding strike teams of marines posed considerable challenges to the opposing US Marine commander, who could not distribute his forces without raising the risk of raiding, but was exposed to fires if he chose to concentrate to both better defend against raiding and to overrun a fairly light Royal Marine defensive screen. To be sure, 40 Commando was operating ahead of 7th Marine Regiment, and was reliant on the US Marine Corps’ organic fires capabilities, as well as support from US airpower. However, it is notable that a comparably equipped Marine Corps opposing force that was not enabled by a light raiding element struggled against one that was. This was due in no small part to the challenge that a combination of fires and raiding posed – dispersion created vulnerabilities against the latter, while concentration was punished by the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a considerable cognitive impact was observed, whereby brigade-level C2 structures were failing to choose positive courses of action, in terms of their tactical plan, because of a perceived threat from the commando force – a threat that was amplified beyond the physical reality. When the adversary force did concentrate against the Royal Marines, it became vulnerable to fires employed by the Marine Corps regiment with which the marines were partnered. Evidence from these exercises illustrates that the force can be disruptive and survivable, even early into the change programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Niche Capabilities in the Urban Littoral&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the experimental evidence regarding the utility of distributed forces in holding up larger ground formations, there is also recent historical evidence to show that forces built around the imperatives of generating situational awareness and forcing adversaries into unmasking for engagement by longer-range strike can be useful in the urban littoral specifically. Urban battles such as those between Russia and Chechen rebels in Grozny (1991) and between the IDF and Palestinian insurgents in Jenin (2002) have illustrated the utility of small teams of infiltrators, as have more recent battles, such as Aden (2016), where the Houthi movement used small teams equipped with Kornet anti-tank guided missiles to good effect. Such forces are not a substitute for heavier forces, and there is a particular utility in being able to call on both armour and large numbers of infantry in urban environments. However, backed by long-range fires, small teams can disrupt adversary movement, and support the reduction of strongpoints. Offshore fire support can be of particular utility for the latter function, as also illustrated at Aden. Low-latency links between distributed teams and fire support from either offshore or disembarked forces can help obviate one of the challenges of providing air support in urban environments – the fact that generating target sets in complex terrain is time consuming and requires careful pattern-of-life analysis, and that air power cannot always be called to bear before circumstances have changed. In the urban littoral, relatively light forces supported by maritime fires can also perform tasks such as the defence of the SPODs that heavier forces need for theatre entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise: an emphasis on distribution with a view to enabling strike-centric operations can enable amphibious forces to be relevant to a range of tasks, from the disruption and attrition of ground formations, to the provision of niche capabilities to partner forces in expeditionary contexts that may involve urban littoral conflict. Moreover, adaptations that can enable dispersion and strike – chief among these being changes to the design philosophy of maritime enablers – can also allow marines to support tasks such as securing and exercising sea control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-more-specialised-force&quot;&gt;A More Specialised Force&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major consequence of the proposed force design is likely to be the optimisation of the commando force in a way that removes certain elements of multifunctionality from its force design. An emphasis on a light force with a limited logistics tail supported by manoeuvre craft, rather than by connectors per se, is likely to remove the force’s ability to aggregate as a more concentrated force to perform tasks such as replacing ground units in the line or conducting patrolling. Moreover, an emphasis on connectors that can support surface manoeuvre at reach and generating fires necessarily means design choices that deemphasise the movement of heavy vehicles. A vessel built to manoeuvre on the water and support fire missions will have a very different profile from one intended to move heavy vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the assumption that the marines would operate as a line unit is a product of an era in which the corps was roughly twice its current size. Moreover, at Alliance level, there has been a broader shift towards threat-based planning, and implicit in this is the optimisation of forces for specific functions. Finally, as discussed, in most likely contested environments, heavy assets may only be moved and sustained after threats to theatre entry have been overcome. At this juncture, their movement is likely to be less reliant on connectors, given that local SPODs and aerial ports of debarkation can be used, along with methods of insertion such as roll-on-roll-off craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to optimise for strike and sea control, along with existing Tier 2 special forces functions, will also likely mean that tasks such as fleet protection in home ports will need to be deemphasised. Notably, security functions are an area where autonomous capabilities can reduce the requirements for human operators in relatively short order, given that these functions are performed in safe home ports. Moreover, certifying marines for a wide range of competencies – a product of the era of counterinsurgency – will likely be impossible, especially if key competencies in areas such as working with autonomous platforms, supporting fires, and operating at sea in support of blue-water forces are to be adequately delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Marines will need to become a more specialised force to be able to deliver the concepts of operations described above. A specialised structure is more consistent with a threat-based planning framework than is the existing force structure. Moreover, given the size of the force, the choice between multifunctionality and specialisation is a notional one – the force cannot perform roles such as line replacement in any case, even if its personnel and structures could theoretically enable it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v-the-royal-marines-capability-requirements&quot;&gt;V. The Royal Marines: Capability Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has sought to articulate the use cases for the Royal Marines in the context of a broader, strike-led, Alliance-level framework for amphibious power projection. This chapter sets out the capability requirements that emerge from the discussion above. At a minimum, a redesigned commando force would need to demonstrate progress towards the following six features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A distributed model of tactical operations across the littoral.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increased range from point of launch of the system to target effect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Delivery of integrated effects at lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resilient sustainment in high-threat contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integration of crewed/machine teaming and robotic and autonomous capabilities ashore and afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deception as a central planning consideration and a capability investment line.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter discusses the design principles and attendant capability sets that can enable the force to deliver progress on achieving these features. The design principles represent the foundational priorities which, if delivered, will drive progress towards attaining the six features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;signature-management-and-resilient-communication&quot;&gt;Signature Management and Resilient Communication&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delivery of integrated effects at lower levels will depend on signature management and a communications architecture that can support a distributed force drawing on non-organic enablers and fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While exercises such as Green DaggerGreen Dagger demonstrated the utility of distributed forces, a limitation in their evidence base is that they did not test the resilience of communications networks. With frequency jamming dictating with whom personnel can communicate at any given time – dependent on which EW assets an opponent is operating – the ability to communicate across multiple pathways takes on increased importance. Organisationally, this will require amphibious forces to be able to communicate across multiple component commands – if a commando unit is cut off from maritime forces, for example, it can still usefully contribute to the ISR screen of a ground component command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This C4ISR requirement brings the “dispersal dilemma” into focus. David Kilcullen has described the difficulty that comes from the need to avoid force concentration, as proximity builds a “targetable” entity. Applying a more distributed model that improves force survivability is inherently desirable, but the communication and information systems network capability that is needed to remain effective builds an electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) signature that offers targeting opportunities for an adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of capabilities, this dilemma introduces two requirements. The first is the ability to rely on multiple redundant networks to deliver data across the force. Expendable bearers such as UAVs can represent one pathway towards this. Equally, as illustrated in Ukraine, a growing range of civilian satellite communications networks can be used by military units, and can remain active even in the face of concerted jamming efforts. Modes of communication such as tropospheric scatter can also be used for reach-back communications, albeit with limitations on the size of data packets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging solutions, such as fully autonomous capability, that can operate without GPS and be fielded at the lowest tactical echelons, will form part of the answer, and feature as a force design principle. Other developments will assist in time, such as machine-learning-based systems that can identify targets from blurred images. If a single image of target quality takes 12 KB of data, machine learning enhancements will allow targets to be decided on the basis of very small data passage requirements. Of course, a behavioural shift away from a currently observed desire for full-motion video (FMV) is still required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commando Force programme’s ongoing technical response to the dispersal dilemma includes introducing low-signature mesh network systems and novel long-range bearer capability, alongside employment of high frequency radio and satellite communications where opportunities allow. The technical response will need, however, to be complemented by the application of recently lost techniques, such as minimising communication traffic, beyond reducing forces’ reliance on FMV. These behavioural adjustments will need to be matched by policy changes that enable targeting decisions to be devolved to lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processing at the edge is also likely to become increasingly important, especially as processing power enables more functions to be performed without the need for reach-back. Project EVE, designed by the Royal Navy’s Marworks team, is an example of a prospective solution here. It will enable data to be processed forward, set the computational capacity for unmanned (UXV) systems to be integrated and controlled when communications are challenged, and provide the battlespace-management platforms that enable the swift allocation of assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;distributed-logistics&quot;&gt;Distributed Logistics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will not only be imperative to distribute the force tactically, but also to create a logistical model ashore that is distributed. While offshore vessels can serve as concentrated logistical nodes, once moved ashore, resupply must be distributed over a wide area, both to prevent interdiction and to meet the requirements of a similarly distributed force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the tactical level, logistic support to a distributed force, at greater range, within a higher threat environment, represents a considerable challenge. Trusted methodologies will need to evolve. Consider, for example, how predictable, linear, “frontline-pull” resupply places a significant constraint on the force, as it tends to drive concentration of assets/activity that is at odds with both the threat picture that has been described above, and viable solutions to it. These tensions were at play in the Falklands campaign: Julian Thomson’s logical desire to build out a beachhead before embarking on assault operations brought with it increased exposure to the Maritime Task Group that could not be accepted. Under emergent conditions in which air-based threats of the kind faced in the Falklands will be joined by short-range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and UAVs, concentrated logistical marshalling points will not be survivable for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be imperative, therefore, to design logistic distribution for a distributed force, with fuel, power and ammunition as the foremost logistic concerns. One means of limiting logistical demands is by managing the logistical “pull” by making the force lighter – with heavier vehicles and assets such as the 105-mm light gun representing sources of demand that can be jettisoned. To the extent that the force is one that aims to disrupt a comparatively small number of high-value targets, as well as enable heavier strike elements, these capabilities become superfluous. Moreover, considerable striking power can be fitted on a comparatively small vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logistical “push” can also be better managed. The Royal Marines are currently conceiving a more prediction-based “logistic-push” model, where supply needs are anticipated, and deposited for forces to collect at their time of choosing. This will rely on automated modelling and acceleration of uncrewed systems into service. In particular, low-cost UAVs capable of carrying large payloads over extended distances will be vital to making this model operational. Examples of cargo drones are already visible in civilian contexts and could be adapted to military requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disadvantages are that such models are likely to be more resource intensive, are open to compromise, and present non-kinetic targeting opportunities to adversary EW. However, the removal of concentrated logistical nodes nonetheless reduces the prospect of catastrophic failure. Instead, one might expect to see a steady loss rate in the face of adversary EW, which can be better mitigated than a single discontinuous event such as the destruction of a single concentrated hub. Some work on use of AI/autonomy proposes the rule that a push-driven model, in which the AI anticipates, is valuable in inverse proportion to the consequences of the AI being wrong. So, for resources such as food or fuel, which are not expendable, but are replaceable, it might be useful to do this on an anticipatory basis, while the movement of munitions will need to be more carefully considered depending on the risk of compromise, and may depend more heavily on surface manoeuvre platforms and collection at the coastline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see, therefore, that on both sides of the conflict threshold, the challenge of supporting a forward-deployed force is one that must be overcome, if amphibious forces are to be effectively optimised for the new operating environment. In routine operations, maintaining capability forward adds pressure to supply chains and contracting solutions. This cost growth might be offset through economies of scale, as partners (notably the US) look to develop stand-in concepts at greater mass. Another cost offset and operational benefit will be in the pressure that littoral forces at sea, positioned with warfighting stocks, takes off the “strategic outload” as a significant conflict breaks out. In this situation, the benefit of holding combined arms capability forward, and being able to sustain it until the joint supply chain is established, will bring opportunities, both to deny the adversary room to manoeuvre, and to project more combat power early in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mobility-and-reach-on-both-sides-of-the-littoral&quot;&gt;Mobility and Reach on Both Sides of the Littoral&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A distributed force that must deliver convergent effects will depend on reach. Many capabilities that provide reach, such as long-range fires or long endurance UAVs should, by virtue of their size, be drawn from the maritime portion of the littoral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, a critical capability underpinning the force described will be surface manoeuvre platforms (as opposed to ship-to-shore connectors), which have the size, versatility and low observability to act as either connectors, strike assets or C-UAS platforms. The aspiration for multirole surface craft – both troop and missile carrying – has previously been shown to have both defensive and offensive benefits. Such capabilities might offer a framework around which integrated coalition activity can be built in constrained geographies, such as the Baltic or Black seas. Moreover, greater ambiguity regarding the function a vessel is playing creates additional dilemmas for an opponent, even if the vessel is detected. This is unlike contemporary connectors, which can only be assault platforms, and which an opponent would likely detect. As noted, platforms such as the Chinese Type-22 low-observable missile catamaran and the Iranian Bladerunner boats already illustrate that potent strike and defensive capabilities can be incorporated onto relatively small vessels by nations with limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key focus area for the FCF programme will be building modularity into future surface manoeuvre platforms as a design principle. This principle already underpins uncrewed solutions such as the US Navy’s planned medium uncrewed surface vessel (MUSV). The FCF programme’s own aspirations are for future surface manoeuvre platforms to have a reach of over 400 nautical miles. An increase in reach will enable manoeuvre platforms, along with other assets, such as vertical lift capabilities, to cover a larger area of the sea with the support of a mothership – enabling sea control missions to be more easily supported in a way that removes pressure from the blue-water navy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving the ability to find and strike at range allows the shipping from which force elements launch more options for maritime manoeuvre, specifically to position within protective umbrellas. Improved connector range presents not only the opportunity for more flexible ship positioning, but also the capacity to create more numerous attack profiles – for example from shore to shore, as well as from ship to shore. Needless to say, the increased size of such vessels as compared with traditional connectors would impose a requirement for size increases on host vessels such as the planned multirole support ship. However, the fact that the reach of these vessels enables motherships to operate at greater distances will, in turn, mitigate the effects of an increase in size in areas such as vulnerability to detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge of building a correct manoeuvre option extends to mobility options ashore – what is the vehicle mix? The UK Commando Force approach sees ISR, mobility and sustainment as part of both offensive capability and force protection. The force must prioritise mobility and a limited logistical burden over protection, unless circumstances make prioritising the latter absolutely necessary. Although recent fighting has illustrated the importance of protected mobility against indirect fires, the size of the elements of the envisioned force means that their primary means of survival is likely to be evading detection to the extent possible and being mobile enough to avoid being fixed when detected. Moreover, the envisioned concept of force employment would see the commando force employed before opponents could entrench and support positions with a large weight of fire. While there may be instances where protection is desired, particularly in lower-intensity conflicts, where sensitivity to casualties is likely to be higher, there is an inverse relationship between the force protection of the commando force’s vehicles and its aggregate lethality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integration of strike and vehicle systems, particularly smaller missile and indirect-fire systems, is an objective of UK development that will serve to increase platform lethality, while reducing the footprint of tactical elements. As noted above, the integration of systems such as NMESIS and SPIKE on platforms such as the joint light tactical vehicle is analogous, if not quite identical, to the solutions that might be pursued. This does not represent a new concept, therefore, but it is novel for light forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;capabilities-underpinning-tactical-deception&quot;&gt;Capabilities Underpinning Tactical Deception&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of deception as a design principle do not need to be rehearsed in detail, except to identify that, as is the case for autonomous systems, difficult investment choices will need to be made if a viable capability suite is to be generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of tools that can enable deception against at least some of the sensors on which adversary concepts of operations depend. Through the use of capabilities such as expendable uncrewed assets acting as decoys, manoeuvre elements can hide within the noise of multiple false positives. Of course, it is precisely this challenge that multispectral sensing architectures are built to defeat, but the challenge of compromising these systems in littoral spaces can be simplified through the exploitation of climatic conditions. For example, climatic conditions can lend themselves, either to subrefraction, which limits the range of radar, or super refraction, which generates false positives (a challenge that can be exacerbated using decoys). Factors such as mist and smog can also pose a challenge for electro-optical sensors. The former is a challenge in theatres such as the Baltic Sea for much of the year, and the latter will become particularly prevalent as littoral spaces are increasingly urbanised. Urbanisation also has the effect of cluttering the electromagnetic spectrum. Of course, forces cannot expect to be safe from the full plethora of methods of detection, but it may be assumed that climatic conditions will confound at least some of them – meaning that the challenge is simplified, relative to that of countering those methods of detection that remain effective. Where radar can be compromised, this can be especially viable, given that many other modes of detection depend on radar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In view of this, a primary focus for the commando force should be on uncrewed solutions that exacerbate the challenges of employing radar effectively in the littoral. This could include offboard active decoys on uncrewed surface vessels that are designed to mimic the radar returns of a surface manoeuvre platform or a larger vessel. Mimicking the visual appearance of platforms and the emissions and thermal signatures of fires platforms in littoral areas is likely to be another priority for forces, to protect both themselves and allied forces. There are a number of existing solutions in this area, including relatively primitive ones, comparable to those employed by Serbian forces against NATO in 1999. The key will be organisational experience, rather than new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final emerging area in which practices underpinning deception will likely need to evolve is in defeating classification, as distinct from detection. Insofar as detection is, at least to a degree, inevitable, to some extent the focus of deception should shift to defeating efforts to classify targets. For example, where opponents rely on modern methods of classification such as machine-learning-based algorithms, it may become more important to focus efforts on “poisoning” data in peacetime – altering the appearance of one’s forces to lead an opponent’s algorithm to draw incorrect correlations in ways that could confound wartime classification efforts. To some extent, this will be a joint force priority, but it is one to which marines can contribute over the course of peacetime activity, such as exercises that they know are being observed. A degree of knowledge regarding adversary algorithms will likely underpin many future approaches to deception. Generating this understanding is a task which will likely be performed at higher echelon, but to which bodies such as 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group could contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multispectral concealment will be a sine qua non for forces ashore. While the details of the specific solutions to multispectral camouflage being pursued by the commando force are not for public disclosure, the primary factor to note for future study is that the major limiting factor is cost, not capability. Thus, the further forward a force is to be placed, the smaller it must be, as viable solutions do not scale. This in turn will create considerable requirements for a small forward element to be able to survey and operate in a comparatively large area to generate value for the strike-centric forces that it is supporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the organisational front, there is a pressing need for all militaries, not least those involved in littoral operations, to rediscover the criticality of deception to operational success. Indeed, there is a case for the integration action model to feature deception activity as a recognised element that must be orchestrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;restructuring-organisational-practices&quot;&gt;Restructuring Organisational Practices&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the paradigm shift in the deception arena that is needed to enable successful combat operations, this paper has highlighted how deterrence by denial may be enhanced through a partner force, if conducted as part of a coordinated campaign approach. There must be changes, however, if this benefit is to be realised. First, within Ministry of Defence (MoD), Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) and fleet scheduling, the shift to a campaign approach has yet to take place, and operational-level planning remains ad hoc. Alignment with US Marine Corps planning routines (orchestrated with an 18-month lead-in through their force synchronisation process) might offer a beneficial forcing function. This does not mean that planning agility is removed, rather that plans are constructed among partners, all of whom realise that national priorities might change what can be done, as their political masters react to events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the force, there will be changes to individual training as a new operational methodology and new technology is integrated. The primary tactical-level adjustment will come, however, in force-generation mechanisms. The UK commando force and other like-sized amphibious forces are not big enough to generate credible forward presence and maintain sequential, onshore force-generation pathways. However, force generation models that assume in-theatre development are not only possible, but deliver considerable value. Furthermore, this type of generation pathway opens the door to force development forming an element of national and Alliance statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, convergent development through programmes such as Fleet Operational Sea Training (FOST) played this role within NATO and served as both a force multiplier and a diplomatic benefit to the UK. This is something that navies have traditionally done well with their ship deployments, and it has gathered pace of late with deterrence efforts in Eastern Europe – but further development is possible. Consider, for example, how the UK, the US and Australia could form a core of littoral force development in the Indo-Pacific region around the development of Force Design 2030, and the move of the Australian Army to be more “amphibious” in its approach. UK commando forces would provide a valuable element in the force mix and would offer a catalysing presence, insofar as they are different but complementary enough to the equivalent forces of both countries. In the European theatre, they would offer the alliance-building function of a force that trains in the High North for a mission in which fires integration is predominant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To retain their utility in the contemporary operating environment, the Royal Marines will need to make significant change to the ways that they deploy, operate and sustain themselves. Key elements of this change will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A shift in emphasis from assault to manoeuvring to enable fires held by other elements of the force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ability to achieve theatre insertion at reach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greater levels of dispersion once disembarked.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These adaptations require considerable adjustments to both capabilities and force models, which would see the ability to strike and raid emphasised at the expense of the light infantry functions that amphibious forces such as the marines have traditionally performed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes imply a degree of ruthless specialisation in term of tactical competencies, if not overall functionality. If realised, however, this kind of change can enable the marines – and indeed other Western forces – to better utilise the advantages that maritime preponderance has historically conferred on them – the opportunity to make the political choice to engage in operations at reach, and the operational flexibility to impose multiple dilemmas on an opponent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has built on evidence from the Royal Marines’ experimentation, academic literature, and previous work conducted by RUSI and the marines to inform ongoing work on the FCF. As the commando force will often find itself operating alongside allies and coalition partners, the discussion has been situated within a broader analysis of the future of Western amphibious capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key finding of the paper is that the maritime forces of Western nations do not need to cede littoral spaces or resign themselves to a growing spatial gap between themselves and the wider joint force. While it is undeniable that challenges to littoral manoeuvre exist, these can be surmounted. To do so requires a radical rethinking, both of force design and of tactics, techniques and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, marine forces will need to be able to generate fires that can contribute to tasks such as suppression of enemy air defences, engaging adversary vessels and striking in the deep areas of the ground fight. The reforms being undertaken by both the US Marine Corps and some European amphibious forces represent a logical progression in this direction. To a great extent, littoral manoeuvre will involve manoeuvre by fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to use the capabilities being generated to effect against complex targets inland requires, however, the ability to survey adversary positions, conduct battle damage assessment and, where possible, force adversary units to concentrate in ways that make them vulnerable. These functions represent an area where lighter forces such as those envisioned in the FCF programme can play an important complementary role alongside heavier Allied assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light, rapidly deployable special operations forces with organic shipping can also support other competitive functions, including the exercise of sea control and early posturing during a crisis that occurs beyond NATO’s area of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, development of the Commando Force is geared towards building a capability that can inhabit the littoral contact layer, bringing increased ISR and strike options to the operational commander. Further, the UK’s political position in NATO, JEF and in the Indo-Pacific region, alongside the UK Commando Force’s relationship with key partners at the military level, sets the conditions for the force to play a vital integration function that enhances military options and the country’s deterrence posture. While the foundations have been set and progress is ongoing, achieving the benefits that this paper describes is by no means certain – both in terms of the MoD’s capacity to resource the transition, and the Royal Navy’s ability to implement a sufficiently rigorous and integrated programme of change. That said, the financial burden on the MoD is manageable, and the change programme, while very complex, is very much within the Royal Navy’s ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future efforts to build the commando force through a wargaming process that allows adaptation to be modelled and tested must include industry and address how changes to the force structure and techniques can be implemented. The lessons learned will help to drive an industrial strategy and determine the balance of investment choices to create more flexibility from production to frontlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such progress will require an acceleration of the rate of experimentation. There will be a need for national capacity to model, simulate, wargame and analyse at a tempo that supports force development that will hold relevance. How this might be achieved is beyond the scope of this paper, but it is intrinsic to the successful development of littoral forces, as well forces more widely, and it deserves attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s furious military response to the atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October is about to enter its fourth month, and there are signs that it will not be the last. Early in the new year, Israel announced that it would withdraw some of its ground forces from Gaza, but rather than signalling an end to the war, this likely represents only a shift in Israel’s approach towards a slightly less intensive campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that Israel is unlikely to stop and declare victory until it can credibly claim to have reached its war aims: the removal of Hamas from power in Gaza, and the destruction of the group’s capacity to pose a military threat to Israel from the territory. Given the somewhat intangible nature of these goals, this may well require – at least from the perspective of the Israeli government – achieving some symbolic victories, including the killing of Hamas’s elusive senior leaders Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Daif, who are widely thought to have been behind the 7 October attacks. How long it will take the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to track them down is anyone’s guess. Other questions, including how Israel intends to deal with an almost completely destroyed Gaza and a displaced and starving population after the war, are even more difficult to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other way this war could end, it has long been assumed, would be as the result of increased US pressure on Israel to wrap up the fighting, which would eventually culminate in Washington joining the increasingly global consensus to call for a ceasefire. The Biden administration’s rhetoric has changed gradually over the past three months, from an unconditional embrace of Israel and its right to strike back after 7 October to growing warnings about the long-term consequences of the mounting civilian death toll. But the president himself still seems reluctant to do more than to try – presumably – to exert influence on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in private. Moreover, it is also far from certain that Netanyahu would be particularly receptive to US pressure, at least in the short term, and especially in a presidential election year in which he might see an opportunity to extract as much as he can from across the US’s deeply polarised political spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-iranianhouthi-challenge-in-the-red-sea&quot;&gt;The Iranian/Houthi Challenge in the Red Sea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the war in Gaza continues, the risks of an expansion of the conflict will remain ever-present. At the beginning of 2024, the Red Sea and the Houthis in Yemen have moved into the spotlight in this regard. Through a combination of missile and drone attacks and hijackings, the group whose rebellion against the Yemeni government in 2014 triggered the war in Yemen that is still going on today and which has close ties to Iran has significantly disrupted traffic through one of the world’s most important shipping lanes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US, backed by European allies like the UK, is leading the international response, and will likely do what it can to keep Israel from taking direct action against the Houthis. From Washington’s perspective, it is clearly preferable to treat the Houthi problem as one akin to that posed by piracy off the Somali coast in the 2000s, rather than to let the Yemeni militia claim to be part of a regional war against Israel and the West. Still, any military effort to remove the Houthi threat to international shipping through the Red Sea is liable to have unintended consequences and might reduce the chances of bringing the war in Yemen to a close in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The challenge of how to deal with Iran, including its nefarious influence across the Middle East and its nuclear programme, must once again be a top priority for policymakers everywhere&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, unless they are destroyed completely (a highly unlikely prospect), the Houthis – and with them their backers in Tehran – have already succeeded in shifting parts of the geopolitical landscape in the Middle East and beyond. From 2023/24 onwards, anyone with a stake in global shipping – that is, almost every economy in the world – will have to face the fact that Iran and its allies now hold at risk two of the world’s most important maritime chokepoints, the Strait of Hormuz and the Bab Al-Mandeb. In other words, the challenge of how to deal with Iran, including its nefarious influence across the Middle East and its nuclear programme, must once again be a top priority for policymakers everywhere, from Washington to capitals across Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-risk-of-a-hezbollahisrael-war-remains&quot;&gt;The Risk of a Hezbollah–Israel War Remains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But escalation risks loom large elsewhere too. Thus far, the much-feared escalation between Israel and Hezbollah has not happened. Violence across the Israeli-Lebanese border has reached its highest level since the 2006 conflict, but both Israel and Hezbollah have carefully avoided a full-scale war. This could change in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assassination of Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut on 2 January, widely attributed to Israel, should put everyone on notice. Israel may bet on Hezbollah’s – and its backer Iran’s – continued desire to keep most of its powder dry for some future confrontation. But brazen strikes on residential areas in Lebanon’s capital are precisely the kind of actions that are liable to increase the political pressure on Hezbollah, which likes to present itself as Lebanon’s protector, especially against its southern neighbour. (It must also be noted that the al-Arouri assassination highlights the possibility that Israel could make good on its threats to pursue Hamas leaders elsewhere in the Middle East – with obvious deleterious consequences for regional stability.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the risk of war between Israel and Hezbollah goes beyond the possibility of a tit-for-tat spiralling out of control. In October, fearing Hezbollah might follow Hamas’s example and try to invade northern Israel, the IDF evacuated dozens of towns and villages near the border (including Kiryat Shmona, a city of more than 20,000 residents). The Israeli government now faces the dilemma that it can hardly tell people to go back to their homes unless it can claim that their security situation has meaningfully changed. Israel insists that Hezbollah must at least comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and withdraw to the north of the Litani River – about 20 miles from the border with Israel – but to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This raises the risk that Israel might eventually resort to using more force than it already does in its near-daily skirmishes with Hezbollah. Israeli leaders may convince themselves that they can achieve their objectives with a limited military campaign, but any operations by Israeli ground forces on Lebanese soil could well upend the restraint Hezbollah has shown to date and result in a war that could be hard to contain. At the very least, the front in such a war would likely extent beyond Lebanon to the Israeli-Syrian border, where Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed groups have long been expanding their positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beyond-boiling-point-the-west-bank-and-israel&quot;&gt;Beyond Boiling Point: The West Bank and Israel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third area in which the war in Gaza is likely to contribute to existing instability, with potential consequences for the wider region, is the situation in the West Bank and Israeli domestic politics, which are closely linked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2024, regional powers will likely seek to protect whatever they can of the de-escalatory trend of the past few years&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although overshadowed by the death and destruction in Gaza, the West Bank has seen the highest levels of violence since the Second Intifada in the early 2000s. More than 450 Palestinians were killed in 2023 – most of them in IDF operations, some by extremist Israeli settlers; 28 Israelis, including 24 civilians, also died in the West Bank in 2023. The Palestinian Authority, which nominally controls at least part of the West Bank, is feckless and despised by the people it is meant to represent. Within the Israeli government, the territory falls under the purview of Netanyahu’s most right-wing allies, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, both of whom are committed to further settlement expansion and removing any prospect of a future Palestinian state. This, together with a Hamas’s aspirations to expand its influence in the West Bank, is a recipe for the eruption of a Third Intifada. But even if there is no escalation in 2024, the West Bank is likely to move to the centre of the reinflamed Israeli-Palestinian conflict once the war in Gaza ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key driver of developments in the West Bank will be Israeli domestic politics. Hamas’s 7 October attack brought Israel’s deeply polarised political landscape together, but the stark divisions clearly remain. On 1 January, the Israeli Supreme Court struck down the judicial reform the Netanyahu government had pushed through the Knesset in July in the face of massive public protests. The prime minister has been on the ropes politically since 7 October; with the worst breakdown of security in Israel’s history happening on his watch, his defeat in any upcoming election is widely regarded as almost certain. However, Netanyahu has been nothing if not a political survivor. His and his right-wing allies’ fight to stay in power will shape Israel – and what Israel does, including in Gaza, the West Bank and the wider region – throughout 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-regional-order-in-tatters&quot;&gt;A Regional Order in Tatters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zooming out to the regional level, 2024 in the Middle East will likely be defined – once again – by questions about the region’s future order. The Gaza war has upended what appeared to be the beginnings of a new arrangement in the region that was characterised by a collective pragmatic emphasis on de-escalation among regional powers. The Gulf Arab states, Iran, Turkey, Egypt and even Syria all appeared intent on finding ways to work together despite their differences; Israeli-Arab normalisation seemed to be progressing towards an eventual deal to formalise relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, regional powers will likely seek to protect whatever they can of the de-escalatory trend of the past few years. Their domestic socioeconomic development, the number one priority for most governments in the region – especially those in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, the region’s most influential Arab states – depends on maintaining at least a modicum of stability. However, as the events of the past three months have shown, their ability to prevent the region’s various complex conflicts – not only that in Israel–Palestine, but also those in Libya, Syria and Yemen – from exploding in their faces is very limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2023, the US stepped in. From the perspective of most of the US’s long-term Arab partners in the region, the Biden administration has given Israel too much leeway and been too uncritical of its response to the Hamas attack. But they were also relieved that the massive deployment of US military assets to the region after 7 October, aimed at deterring Iran and Hezbollah, helped to stave off an immediate widening of the conflict. Riyadh is also glad that the US is dealing with the Houthis’ disruption of traffic through the Red Sea, enabling the Kingdom itself to preserve its own fragile understanding with the group which it hopes can allow it to end its eight-year military intervention in Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Saudi Arabia and other regional states can be under no illusion that the US, regardless of who is elected president at the end of the year, ultimately does not want to regard the Middle East as one of its top priorities anymore. At the same time, the current crisis has shown that neither China, Russia nor any other contenders – real or imagined – to the status of centres of gravity in an emerging multipolar order have the ability or will to meaningfully support or manage regional security and stability. For the Middle East, 2024 will therefore be yet another unsettling year, in which governments will have to dedicate far more bandwidth than they would like to their region’s disorder and uncertain place in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic trade tools, advanced technologies, and de-risking continue to feature prominently in evolving economic and national security agendas. The nexus of trade policy and national security has been particularly dynamic in the United States, which maintains one of the world’s most advanced trade tool kits for national security. Questions have emerged, however, about whether the use of these trade tools serves primarily as a national security instrument or whether their use is motivated primarily by a bid to protect domestic industry. As technology grows in foreign policy importance, the line between what is critical to national security versus what is critical to economic security is increasingly blurred. One technology increasingly under the security spotlight is lidar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defining-lidar&quot;&gt;Defining Lidar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light detection and ranging, or lidar technology, is a dual-use technology, which means it has both civilian and military uses. Lidar uses laser pulses to hit objects and reflect back, calculating the position, size, and velocity of surrounding objects. These laser pulses occur at rates of millions of beams per second, creating a highly accurate and real-time 3D image of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lidar is widely used in commercial and scientific applications. In 2018, archeologists used lidar to scan the jungle along the border of Guatemala and Mexico, digitally removing the dense tree layer to reveal swaths of Mayan ruins. In “smart city” infrastructure programs, lidar collects data to improve road safety and support traffic management. Lidar is also critical in driverless cars. All major autonomous vehicle producers (with the exception of Tesla) use lidar as “3D eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lidar-and-us-national-security&quot;&gt;Lidar and U.S. National Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lidar also has myriad military applications. The integration of lidar into aerial vehicles like drones can enhance their autonomous capabilities, such as navigation and collision avoidance, improving their ability to navigate complex environments. Lidar can also map battlefields and gather reconnaissance, scouting for potential danger without risking soldiers’ lives to map the places satellites cannot see. Lidar can also assess buildings for structural damage, locate sea mines using bathymetric lidar (which passes through water), and estimate the effectiveness of weapons by evaluating atmospheric conditions. The U.S. Army is currently developing its own autonomous vehicles through a $49.9 million project with autonomous truck company Kodiak Robotics, which uses only U.S.-produced lidar for military purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;data-concerns&quot;&gt;Data Concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One national security element of lidar that has garnered attention among U.S. policymakers is its potential to generate large swaths of data about urban environments and critical infrastructure. A 2016 Intel study revealed that autonomous vehicles could produce 4,000 gigabytes of data each day, underscoring the tremendous amounts of data they hoover up from surrounding environments. Lidar is used in almost all commercial autonomous vehicles currently tested and sold in the United States. Transmitting data to China could also lead to its access to perfect renderings of critical U.S. infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fears about data generation and gathering are likely exaggerated. Hesai, a major Chinese producer of lidar, has publicly stated that their products are closed systems, do not connect to the internet, and therefore cannot physically transfer data. Hesai has also stated that their lidar is not suitable for military use and is not sold to U.S. military end-users. A recent House Select Committee report on the need to “reset” U.S.-China economic relations has asked the Department of Commerce to investigate whether lidar produced by a foreign adversary poses a national security risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinese-lidar&quot;&gt;Chinese Lidar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, several Chinese ministries, including the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), identified lidar as a “strategic emerging industry.” This designation jumpstarted growth in state investment in the industry and was accompanied by additional support for sectors that use lidar, such as autonomous vehicles and smart city programs. Chinese companies have also been accused of stealing foreign intellectual property, resulting in patent infringement lawsuits from several U.S. companies. China also pursued “leapfrogging,” an effort to ensure that Chinese companies could jump to produce the most advanced technology and avoid having to fight for space in which foreign countries already dominate. A Chinese expert on intelligent vehicles suggested applying this agenda to lidar by focusing on solid-state lidar instead of the typical 360-degree lidar produced by U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;possible-military-connections&quot;&gt;Possible Military Connections&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hesai is the largest Chinese lidar company by sales, capturing over 47 percent of global market share and 67 percent of the autonomous vehicle market. Hesai is reportedly tied to the Chinese military through the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC), a state-owned dual-use electronics manufacturer that produces technology for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Hesai has denied these allegations. The House Select Committee letter to the executive branch also accuses Robosense, another major Chinese lidar manufacturer, of ties to the Harbin Institute of Technology, a military university. Huawei, long accused of having ties to the Chinese government, has also recently entered the lidar market. However, linkages between private companies and the Chinese government can be murky, and unsubstantiated conjecture can increase tensions without bolstering U.S. national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-security-considerations&quot;&gt;Economic Security Considerations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lidar technology was originally developed in the United States, but the growth of Chinese firms has imperiled the long-term viability of the U.S. lidar sector. The United States maintains robust and well-utilized national security instruments to combat nonmarket economic practices that result in injury of U.S. firms. These include Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974; Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962; and antidumping, countervailing, and Section 337 investigations under the Tariff Act of 1930.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of these statutes to specific cases is contingent upon a lengthy litigation and investigation process, in which identifying injury by a foreign government can be difficult. While lidar was originally developed and dominated by U.S. firms, the proliferation of lidar in domestic Chinese markets has brought costs down and created a more competitive market overall. There are obvious parallels to the electric vehicle market, in which China’s electric vehicle market has shrunk from 300 companies in 2021 to 50 firms today, far outpacing the number of U.S. peer competitors. The potentially bleak consequences of Chinese electric vehicles on European and U.S. firms are likely to result in enhanced protective measures and have already resulted in a European Commission anti-subsidy investigation. A similar dynamic is playing out in the lidar sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth of foreign lidar companies, even if driven by good faith competition, could potentially imperil the longevity of U.S. firms. Foreign domination of a U.S. sector potentially creates a “weaponized interdependence” scenario in which a foreign government can exercise chokepoints and cut off supplies. This risk is not theoretical. Lidar was added to a draft Chinese government export control list in December 2022, with an official announcement that certain types of lidar — specifically laser range finders — would be restricted on July 31, 2023, as part of a larger swath of controls on drones and drone equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-trade-and-investment-instruments&quot;&gt;U.S. Trade and Investment Instruments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States maintains what is arguably the world’s most advanced trade and investment tool kit at the nexus of national security. Exercising some of these instruments to a fuller extent could better protect the U.S. lidar sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;commerce-department-instruments&quot;&gt;Commerce Department Instruments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bureau of Industry and Security’s (BIS) Entity List identifies and lists organizations believed to be acting against the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. The entities listed face presumptions of denial for export licenses for all items subject to export regulations, restricting access to sensitive U.S. technologies for national security and foreign policy reasons. Huawei, which now produces lidar products, is listed, as are CETC and the Harbin Institute, which are reported to have ties to Hesai and Robosense. No other Chinese lidar firms are included on the Entity List.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of Congress have recently accused BIS of underutilizing its full authorities by permitting the outflow of certain technologies to China. Representative Michael McCaul (R-TX), who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has accused the agency in a major 90-day review report of enabling “a virtually unrestricted flow of American technology to CCP-controlled companies, facilitating China’s rapid rise as a technological, economic, and military superpower.” BIS, on the other hand, maintains that permitting the outflow of technologies to China provides badly needed export revenue for U.S. firms, allowing them to redouble research and development efforts, thus enabling them to retain a competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2023, the House Select Committee addressed a letter to Secretaries Raimondo, Yellen, and Austin calling for additional scrutiny over foreign lidar. The letter urged BIS to implement narrow controls on Field Programmable Gate Array chips, which are necessary for lidar and overwhelmingly produced by Xilinx Inc. and Altera Corporation in the United States. Current controls cover some of these chips but not those used in lidar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;treasury-department-instruments&quot;&gt;Treasury Department Instruments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of the Treasury’s Non-SDN Chinese-Military Industrial Complex (NS-CMIC) List identifies entities that the U.S. government has determined are involved in the development or production of military equipment or materials for the PLA. The list is designed to prevent U.S. persons and entities from investing in or supporting companies that could contribute to advancing PLA military capabilities. The NS-CMIC List undergoes regular updates to reflect changes in China’s military industry. The overarching goal of the NS-CMIC is to impede China’s military-civil fusion strategy and overall modernization of the PLA. The list has also identified Chinese companies involved in the development of other advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, advanced semiconductors, and hypersonic weapons. Huawei and CETC are included on this list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-department-instruments&quot;&gt;Defense Department Instruments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense’s (DOD) Chinese Military Companies List, also known as the Section 1260H list, is a list of Chinese military companies that are “operating directly or indirectly in the United States.” The DOD began publishing this list in 2021 as required by an amendment to the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). It was intended to replace a previous list published by the DOD that identified communist Chinese military companies as instructed by Section 1237 of the 1999 NDAA. A major difference between the two lists is that 1260H list redefined what constituted military ties to capture companies that were a part of civil-military fusion, reflect the modern Chinese military chain of command, and narrow the scope of companies to identify risks more effectively. Under Executive Orders (EO) 13959 and 13974, then president Trump blocked U.S. persons from owning securities from companies on the Section 1237 list, a decision that was continued through President Biden’s own EO. Huawei and CETC were included in the earliest tranche of the 1260H list published in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;investment-instruments&quot;&gt;Investment Instruments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2023, the Biden administration issued an EO establishing an outbound investment notification regime covering chips, artificial intelligence, and quantum investments. The EO directs the Department of Treasury to require notification of certain transactions, while prohibiting certain higher-risk transactions. Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Bob Casey (D-PA) had included networked lasered scanning systems, a type of lidar, in the amendment to the 2024 NDAA via the Outbound Investment Transparency Act, although lidar was not included in the EO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) examines national security risks of foreign investment. A September 2022 EO expanded CFIUS’ ability to protect U.S. technology and more directly tied CFIUS objectives to preserving U.S. technological leadership and enhancing U.S. supply chain resilience in line with overall security objectives. Prior to the EO, CFIUS had approved Chinese acquisitions, reverse mergers, and investments in U.S. lidar companies but will likely face growing pressure to approach those transactions more critically. CFIUS is simultaneously facing calls to maintain openness where possible, particularly since it has reviewed a record number of filings, despite slowing foreign direct investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tariff-remedies&quot;&gt;Tariff Remedies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act grants the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) the power to conduct investigations and measures to uphold U.S. rights under trade agreements, as well as to address specific foreign trade practices, including intellectual property violations, discriminatory taxation, unfair subsidies, currency manipulation, and illegal sourcing. Under presidential guidance, Section 301 authorizes the USTR to investigate and effectively counteract unfair trade practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 14, 2017, then president Trump called on the USTR to investigate China’s technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation practices under Section 301. This investigation identified four Chinese practices related to technology as unreasonable or discriminatory, specifically their technology transfer requirements, licensing restrictions, outbound investment regime, and theft of intellectual property. In March 2018, the USTR announced tariffs of 10 or 25 percent on a variety of Chinese products. One of the covered products was lidar, under HTS code 9015.80.20, which was then subject to a 25 percent tariff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if certain hard security aspects of lidar remain murky, it is critical that the U.S. government bolster efforts to support the domestic lidar industry and pursue preventive measures where possible. Policymakers should consider the following measures to support the U.S. lidar sector:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure that the United States maintains a domestic supply of lidar.&lt;/strong&gt; Ensuring domestic supplies reduces the likelihood of a foreign actor weaponizing dependance on lidar. It also “de-risks” lidar use in military applications by ensuring that the provider is not an entity with foreign military ties.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initiate additional investigations into foreign lidar to determine data leakage risks.&lt;/strong&gt; Questions abound about the hard security risks of lidar, spanning data flows and 3D mapping of critical infrastructure. The Department of Commerce, in partnership with the End-User Review Committee, should conduct a review that would provide resources to more definitively identify data flow risks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use export restrictions lightly.&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike other critical technologies, it is difficult to claim that the United States maintains chokepoints over lidar since some Chinese products are superior in both quality and price. U.S. export controls could thus have a limited effect on certain Chinese lidar capabilities, while narrowing the market for U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest in talent strategies and technology capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; It is critical that the U.S. government pursue “promote” policies in addition to “protect” policies. Relaxing immigration requirements to encourage more advanced STEM professionals to work in the United States should be a key priority, particularly as workforce woes become increasingly acute. Moreover, future talent gaps could ultimately decide the winners of the tech race.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider the application of emerging instruments to the lidar sector.&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. Congress demonstrated some enthusiasm for covering lidar under an outbound investment regime. Upon concluding an investigation, if it is determined that lidar does pose a national security threat, the United States should consider expanding the scope of an outbound investment regime to include lidar technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advanced technologies are driving a new era of economic security in which national security and domestic economic interests are increasingly intertwined. The U.S. government should explore the full toolkit at its disposal to evaluate the possible risks of an overdependence on foreign lidar. Lidar will enable significant leaps forward in both civilian and military applications, underscoring the necessity of maintaining a U.S. supply that cannot be weaponized by a foreign actor, but protective trade measures are only part of the equation. Efforts to “run faster” will better enable the United States to map the geostrategic future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（4日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第6日審訊。控方繼續開案陳詞，指國安法生效後，黎智英持續在專欄撰文及在 Twitter 發文，稱推行國安法會導致中國被國際圍堵，又表態支持美國推行《香港避風港法案》和《香港人自由和選擇法》。黎接受外媒採訪時稱：「我將會留在這裡直至最後一日⋯⋯直至我不能再留或我們陣營的人全部被捕或離去。」如果他離開會令自己蒙羞，也會令《蘋果日報》名譽受損。黎於2020年8月10日被拘捕，他獲釋後，《蘋果日報》隨即以頭版報導黎智英稱：「坐監都揀呢條路。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方國安法生效後-黎智英續撰文提制裁&quot;&gt;控方：國安法生效後 黎智英續撰文提制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續開案陳詞，指《國安法》生效之後，黎智英持續利用《蘋果日報》作為平台發布煽動文章，美化及鼓吹示威者的違法行為，又請求外國勢力向中港官員實施制裁。在2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日期間，《蘋果》發布了合共85篇煽動刊物，其中31篇含有請求外國勢力向中港官員實施制裁、封鎖或其他敵對措施的內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中黎智英在專欄「成敗樂一笑」所撰寫的文章，涉及請求外國制裁的內容，包括：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;《有種回力鏢……自插心臟》（2020年7月26日）：黎稱國安法生效後，會損害中國經濟及引來國際圍堵。黎又指美國會有強烈反制措施，以及制裁和懲罰。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;《繼續打壓香港 還是以身報國？》（2020年9月27日）：黎形容國安法是中央殘暴和惡毒的手段去打壓香港人追求民主自由&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;《台灣也要感謝黨》（2020年10月11日）：黎稱若日本、澳洲和西方國家向中國實施科技禁運及制裁，中國的經濟和科技發展將會停滯，而台灣能獲得好處，又指國家領導人習近平是自大及獨裁&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;《天下圍中 拜登騎虎難下》（2020年11月29日）：黎呼籲拜登政府不要採取「多邊主義」外交手段，若果拜登政府不繼續上一任總統特朗普的「對中國不妥協」政策，台灣的形勢將會惡化&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎被捕獲釋後-蘋果頭版報導坐監都揀呢條路&quot;&gt;控方：黎被捕獲釋後 蘋果頭版報導「坐監都揀呢條路」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英於2020年8月10日被警方國安處拘捕，其後獲得警方擔保。8月13日，《蘋果日報》頭版報導黎智英稱：「坐監都揀呢條路」，並引述黎稱：「將來瞓喺監獄，whatever，我都係會揀呢條路。」報章另發布報導引述黎稱「手銬都不能侮辱我」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，黎於2020年12月還柙後，來監獄探訪的人包括張劍虹、陳沛敏、羅偉光、馮偉光、張志偉。《蘋果日報》仍繼續運作，而黎則繼續給予指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MRpnfLP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又提到，楊清奇負責聯絡《蘋果》不同專欄作者，包括李怡，亦曾安排區家麟撰稿，而區的文章亦構成部份煽動內容。黎亦曾介紹日本籍的作者替《蘋果》撰文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎受訪稱不會離開-否則令自己蒙羞&quot;&gt;黎受訪稱「不會離開」 否則令自己蒙羞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英在2020年7月1日接受《霍士新聞》（Fox News）訪問，提到香港或不再是金融中心（financial hub），當中譴責《國安法》和中共，又指會在香港留到最後一刻。庭上播放片段，黎提到《國安法》內文比最壞的想像更差，港人之間溝通要變得非常小心，又批評《國安法》凌駕立法會、取代法治和《基本法》，令做生意的人無法受到保障，難以維持香港的金融地位。被問到是否害怕被捕，黎指「我不擔心，因為我不能擔心，如果我擔心就不能做或講任何事情」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於會否離港，他則堅決表示不會：「我將會留在這裡直至最後一日（“I’m going to stay until the last day.”）⋯⋯直至我不能再留或我們陣營的人全部被捕或離去。不，我不能離開，如果我離開，我令自己蒙羞，我令《蘋果日報》名譽受損，我也損害民主運動的團結。（“Until I can’t stay or everybody in our camp is either arrested or gone. I can’t go away, if I go away, I disgrace myself, I discredit Apple Daily, I also undermine the solidarity of the democratic movement.”）」被問到他曾被捕數次，所涉罪名或能判終身監禁，黎指他不知道將會發生什麼，「但當政府不尊重法律，你不會知道紅線在哪。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QVW9KWK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;播放片段期間，黎智英專注望向前方螢幕，一度輕輕搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎twitter發文支持美推行法案及制裁-獲特朗普讚勇敢受寵若驚&quot;&gt;控方：黎Twitter發文支持美推行法案及制裁 獲特朗普讚勇敢受寵若驚&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦展示多則 Twitter 帖文。2020年7月15日，黎智英轉載美國駐港澳領事館關於民主派初選的聲明，黎標註（Tag）時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧及美國駐港澳領事館的 Twitter，感謝他們對香港人的支持，又稱國際間發聲及採取行動防範中共打壓自由，是前所未有的重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月17日，黎智英在 Twitter 發文指《香港避風港法案》（Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act）和《香港人自由和選擇法》（Hong Kong People’s Freedom and Choice Act）是逆權運動的重要資源，向所有前美國政府及國務院職員致敬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“#HongKong #SafeHarborAct and #PeoplesFreedomandChoiceAct are good wherewithals to our resistance movement. Salute all former CGs and State Dept staff for caring about this place we call home.” — 黎智英 Twitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月23日，黎智英 Twitter 發文指年輕人是爭取自由運動的中流砥柱，但他們危在旦夕，而英國推行BNO簽證新政策作為香港人的「救生艇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This is urgent and necessary. Our young people are the backbone of our freedom movement. They’re in the most danger. U.K. launches lifeboat for Hongkongers with focus on younger generation with new BN(O) visa.” — 黎智英 Twitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日黎智英再發文，指美國應對尋求庇護的香港年輕人寬大，因他們為了爭取自由失去很多（“The US should be lenient for young #HKers seeking asylum. They suffered a lot fighting for #HongKong’s freedom.”），並轉載《蘋果》英文新聞，標題指《國安法》生效後，辦理移民美國的律師稱有關政治庇護的查詢驟增。（“Political asylum inquiries surge after national security law: US immigration lawyer”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月21日，黎智英 Twitter 引述《蘋果》報導指時任美國總統特朗普稱呼黎作勇敢的人，他感到受寵若驚，但他還未夠勇敢去對抗習近平，他只是為香港和台灣站出來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“President @realDonaldTrump calls me a brave man. I am flattered. But I am not brave enough to stand against the whole world like #Xi. I only #StandWithHongKong #StandwithTaiwan” — 黎智英 Twitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年9月17日，黎智英 Twitter 稱，當美國等聯合一起實施制裁，中共同伙便會無處躲避，他們的資產亦無處可藏，並需為迫害香港人而承受後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When America and the rest of the free world are aligned and put in place the sanctions, CCP’s accomplices have nowhere to turn, and their assets have nowhere to hide. Their evil deeds persecuting of HKers will have consequences.” — 黎智英 Twitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年12月1日，黎轉載《蘋果》英文新聞指林鄭因被美國制裁而家中堆放大量現金，黎稱拜登政府應令協助中共的人付上責任，制裁措施可挫他們的士氣，即使只為他們帶來少許不便，也是有效用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Biden administration should know that by making those abetting CCP repression personally accountable the measures can frustrate their morale of evil doing, thus will be effective even the measures may seem inconveniences in small ways.” — 黎智英 Twitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李運騰和李素蘭審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英的律師團隊包括資深大律師彭耀鴻和大律師 Marc Corlett、關文渭、黃雅斌、董皓哲及李峰琦。3間蘋果日報公司清盤人由大律師王國豪代表。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 資深大律師 彭耀鴻（右）、大律師 Marc Corlett（左）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方由副刑事檢控專員周天行、署理助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤、高級檢控官吳加悅及陳穎琛等代表。警方國安處總警司李桂華則坐在律政司團隊後排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同案8名被告：前行政總裁張劍虹、前總編輯羅偉光、前副社長陳沛敏、前執行總編輯林文宗、前英文主筆馮偉光、前主筆楊清奇、李宇軒和陳梓華，早前已承認「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，現正還柙，等待黎智英審訊完畢後判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，於2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀，請求外國或者境外機構、組織、人員實施對香港特別行政區或者中華人民共和國進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，指黎智英於2020年7月1日至今年2月15日間，與 Mark Simon、陳梓華、李宇軒、劉祖廸及其他人串謀，請求外國或境外機構、組織、人員，實施對中國或香港進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司於2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及/或複製煽動刊物，具意圖：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a) 引起憎恨或藐視中央或香港特別行政區政府或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b) 激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變其他在香港的依法制定的事項&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;c) 引起對香港司法的憎恨、藐視或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;d) 引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;e) 煽惑他人使用暴力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;f) 慫使他人不守法或不服從合法命令。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（4日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第6日審訊。控方續開案陳詞，就涉及李宇軒、陳梓華和「攬炒巴」劉祖廸等人的「串謀勾結外國勢力」控罪，控方指黎智英為主腦和金主，透過陳梓華作為「中間人」，向李宇軒和劉祖廸傳達指示，以「重光團隊（SWHK）」作平台，請求外國對中港實施制裁或敵對行動。當中黎智英曾在台灣向陳梓華和劉祖廸等人解釋其「支爆」計劃，並提出進行國際游說，令港府同意其議程、甚至推翻中共，李宇軒等人負責執行。而落實策略包括全球登報和眾籌；以「美國線」、「英國線」和「日本線」與當地政治人物接觸和聯繫，游說制裁中港；及發布制裁名單等。其中黎曾為全球登報墊支約500萬港元，並資助外國政治人物來港監察區選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方陳梓華經李柱銘認識黎智英助手指示李宇軒加入攬炒團隊&quot;&gt;控方：陳梓華經李柱銘認識黎智英助手、指示李宇軒加入「攬炒團隊」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今續讀出就黎智英與李宇軒等人，串謀勾結外國勢力罪行的開案陳詞。控方指稱，黎智英與李宇軒、陳梓華、Mark Simon、劉祖廸，及英國保守黨人權委員會委員裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）、日本眾議院議員菅野志櫻里、及英國金融家比爾布勞德（Bill Browder），串謀請求英、美、日及歐洲等國，對中港政府實施制裁或採取敵對行動，包括停止與香港的司法互助及或引渡協議、向香港停售武器、限制中港貿易，並以「重光團隊（Stand with Hong Kong Fight for Freedom，簡稱 SWHK）」作平台促進串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2019年6月反修例運動期間，陳梓華在 Telegram 群組「G20」得悉有示威者欲尋求黎智英資助進行「全球登報」，以尋求外國對中港政府施壓。陳其後嘗試透過李柱銘接觸黎智英，並獲介紹認識黎的助手 Mark Simon，Simon 轉告黎支持計劃，願預留500萬港元作廣告開支，事後需還款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華遂聯絡群組成員之一的李宇軒，表示自己是黎智英的「中間人」，並要求李在G20峰會時組織全球登報，促使外國向港府施壓；陳並於2019年7月指示李加入「攬炒團隊」為核心成員，李和「攬炒巴」劉祖廸其後負責團隊運作，並透過陳接收黎智英和 Mark Simon 的指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年7月，陳梓華首次與黎智英會面，同場還有李柱銘，飯局上黎智英指示陳透過 Mark Simon 接觸他，又着陳向激進示威者轉達訊息，指他們應採用較溫和的手段以爭取國際支持。同年8月，李宇軒和劉祖廸等人成立「重光團隊（SWHK）」，目的是請求外國制裁中港政府和介入警暴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎智英為主腦金主-陳梓華為中間人-李宇軒執行指示&quot;&gt;控方：黎智英為主腦、金主 陳梓華為中間人 李宇軒執行指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就各人角色，控方指黎智英為主腦和金主，負責「最高指揮」；Mark Simon 是黎的代理人，直接向黎匯報和負責執行其指示，及審理財政援助的申請，黎本人會批核大額財政，Mark Simon 則負責較低金額。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於陳梓華是中間人，直接從黎智英或透過 Mark Simon 接收黎的指示，再傳達予李宇軒和劉祖廸，並與外媒聯絡放置廣告；李和劉則為團隊對外核心成員，按黎智英或 Mark Simon 經陳梓華的指示，指揮其他團隊成員，李並曾在眾籌前預付登報的費用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而 SWHK 則自2019年8月起被用作平台實施串謀，透過社交媒體上的政治宣傳、發布文章、與外國政治人物或社運人士聯繫，請求外國對中港實施制裁、封鎖或其他敵對行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎在台與攬炒巴等會面談支爆-促制裁甚至推翻中共&quot;&gt;控方：黎在台與「攬炒巴」等會面談「支爆」 促制裁甚至推翻中共&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，2020年1月，黎智英指示 Mark Simon 安排與陳梓華、劉祖廸和一名林姓女示威者在其台灣陽明山寓所會面，會上黎解釋其「支爆」計劃，即透過造成中國行政及經濟動盪令中國政府倒台，並解釋國際游說的4個階段：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;（i）令外國知悉香港發生什麼事；&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;（ii）呼籲外國政府關注和譴責港府；&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;（iii）會見外國官員並將他們想法帶回香港；&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;（iv）會見外國政治顧問，以影響其政府對華政策，促使對香港及中國實施制裁，令港府同意其議程，甚至推翻中共。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何俊仁和李永達其後亦加入該會面。此外，黎智英亦安排陳梓華、李宇軒和女示威者在台灣會見施明德，讓施分享抗爭的經驗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，各人其後討論如何執行黎的「支爆」計劃，當中陳梓華負責聯絡抗爭相關人士，李宇軒繼續國際游說及建立國際網絡，劉祖廸扮演精神領袖宣揚「攬炒」。至2020年5月，Mark Simon 與陳梓華會面重申4階段國際游說；黎智英於同年6月與陳會面，指示他繼續進行國際游說，又邀請陳到壹傳媒大樓會面，強調《蘋果日報》英文版的重要性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方李宇軒被捕後-mark-simon曾稱運作不受影響&quot;&gt;控方：李宇軒被捕後 Mark Simon曾稱運作不受影響&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方並指，《國安法》生效後，陳梓華和 Mark Simon 繼續保持聯絡，而李宇軒於2020年8月被捕後，Simon 告知陳梓華 SWHK 的運作不會受影響，因他們有 Plan B，就是讓劉祖廸到美國演講宣揚「攬炒」理念，並繼續要求美國制裁中港政府。同年10月，陳梓華被以「協助罪犯罪」被捕並獲保釋，Simon 仍鼓勵他繼續國際游說，又稱會向他提供協助，包括安排他到美國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎智英指示李宇軒3次全球登報墊支約510萬&quot;&gt;控方：黎智英指示李宇軒3次全球登報、墊支約510萬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎智英等人採取不同策略勾結外國勢力，包括全球登報和眾籌、建立國際網絡、及發布文章、新聞稿和制裁報告等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就全球登報及眾籌，控方指，李宇軒在黎智英及 Mark Simon 經陳梓華指示下，於2019年6、7、8月分別組織3次全球登報，在美、加、英、日及台等多地報章刊登文章，呼籲譴責中國、香港政府和香港警察，並促請對中港實施制裁。其中加拿大《環球郵報》〈Stand With Hong Kong Until Dawn〉，提到望加政府承認香港警察犯下反人類罪行，實施制裁和禁向香港售武；美國《紐約時報》〈Catch Hong Kong As We Fall〉，則促美方停止賣彈藥予香港警察並通過《香港人權及民主法案》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為支付相關費用，李宇軒及陳梓華等人發起3次眾籌，分別籌得約700萬港元、30萬英鎊（約310萬港元）及183萬美元（約1,440萬港元），即共約2,450萬港元。控方並指黎智英透過 Mark Simon 提供財政支持，其中第一次登報開支約600萬港元，黎和 Simon 透過二人持有的公司 LAIS Hotel Properties Limited 及力高顧問，墊支156萬港元給至少5份報章；李宇軒其後在8月初將156萬港元轉帳到台灣的查德威有限公司償還黎，以避免黎的身分曝光。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Simon 亦協助處理眾籌款項，就第二次全球登報，Mark Simon 將眾籌的約310萬港元，存入《蘋果日報》專欄作者 Jack Henry Hazlewood 的英國戶口，再轉帳給李宇軒。就第三次全球登報，Mark Simon 將眾籌資金存入其美國戶口，再存入他成立的信託基金「The Project Hong Kong Trust」，再透過基金將約320萬港元存入李宇軒戶口；LAIS Hotel 及力高亦向6份報章支付354萬港元，包括向《日本經濟新聞》支付約147萬港元。庭上展示 WhatsApp 訊息，Mark Simon 曾表示已獲歸還所有就國際廣告支付的款項（“all monies that were used for the international ad campaign are now back with us”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰一度問及，控方展示 Mark Simon 的 WhatsApp 訊息，是否依賴該些訊息的真實性，周天行回應視乎情況，指部分訊息有銀行紀錄支持。惟李運騰指即使如此，該些訊息仍屬「傳聞證供」，控方不能以此證明 Simon 訊息所說為真，周天行終稱只會用以證黎智英犯案時的心態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎智英資助辦展覽及組織選舉監察團轉讓公司予陳梓華作回報&quot;&gt;控方：黎智英資助辦展覽及組織選舉監察團、轉讓公司予陳梓華作回報&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎智英亦為其他宣傳提供財政支持，包括2019年8月，Mark Simon 轉帳3萬元予陳梓華，由李予信協助籌辦報紙展覽；10月黎智英再轉帳14.41萬元予陳，組織其他報紙展覽和街站；11月 Mark Simon 轉帳50萬元予李宇軒組織「選舉監察團」，邀請外國政治人物來港監察區議會選舉。2020年1月，黎智英亦將一所在英屬維爾京群島註冊的公司「LACOCK」轉讓予陳梓華，包括股權、董事及銀行戶口的簽署人，作為陳提供協助的回報。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，黎智英和 Mark Simon 亦透過陳梓華，批准李宇軒免費使用《蘋果日報》就鄧小平簽署《中英聯合聲明》的版權相片；《蘋果日報》亦在重要版面刊登第三次全球登報的詳情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，眾籌的資金同時用作 SWHK 營運開支及作國際游說工作，及邀請英國國會議員 Bob Seely 於2019年8月來港觀察反修例運動。而由於眾籌資金用畢，劉祖廸於2020年5月提出進行第4次眾籌，團隊於8月籌得170萬美元（約1,320萬港元），並存放在由 Mark Simon 設立和控制的「the Project Hong Kong Trust」，並按其指示將有關款項用於國際游說工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除了全球登報，控方亦指 SWHK 被用作平台以建立國際網絡爭取外國支持，及向中港施壓。在2019年10至11月，團隊資助香港大專學生在日內瓦、柏林、巴黎、倫敦及華盛頓會見外國政治人物，游說他們支持反修例示威；同年11月發起「選舉監察團」，邀請19名外國政治人物來港監察區議會選舉，期間李宇軒與 Lord Alton、Luke de Pulford、陳方安生和李柱銘會面，擴展網絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而為促進串謀，及在黎智英指示下，陳梓華、李宇軒及劉祖廸等人與美國、英國及日本的政治人物接觸和持續聯繫，並稱之為「美國線」、「英國線」與「日本線」。「美國線」方面，黎智英同意 Mark Simon 於2019年9月安排李宇軒與潛在美國總統參選人、參議員斯科特 Rick Scott、其助手 Scott Sciretta 及美國領事職員 Alan Brinker 會面，李透過展示277粒警方使用過的彈藥，就「警暴」進行游說，陳梓華並曾指示李宇軒隱藏「資助人（backers）」黎和 Simon 的身分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同年12月，李宇軒到美國與「香港民主委員會」創辦人、朱耀明兒子朱牧民及美國參議員 Rick Scott、Todd Young 和 Ted Cruz 會面，陳梓華提醒李把握機會建立美國網絡並游說制裁中港政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方陳方安生邀李宇軒與英領事等會面李協助ipac工作&quot;&gt;控方：陳方安生邀李宇軒與英領事等會面、李協助IPAC工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「英國線」方面，2019年12月，黎智英安排陳梓華於倫敦與「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯 Benedict Rogers 會面；同月在陳方安生邀請下，李宇軒參與時任英國駐港領事 Andrew Heyn 舉辦的飯局，席間除陳方安生外，李柱銘、郭榮鏗和莫乃光均有出席。至2020年1或2月，陳方安生再邀陳梓華和李宇軒在其辦公室會面，就對示威的看法交流意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同年5月，英國保守黨人權委員會委員裴倫德向李宇軒提出，有意成立「對華政策跨國議會聯盟（IPAC）」，成員包括對中國採強硬立場的各國議員，以爭取落實制裁中港政府的政策。Mark Simon 指示 SWHK 應加入 IPAC，SWHK 遂於2020年6月在裴倫德招募下加入 IPAC 秘書處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同年7月，李宇軒向裴倫德建議游說英、美、日、德國、西班牙、意大利等多個國家，停止與香港的司法互助或逃犯引渡協議；其後在黎智英和 Mark Simon 指示下，陳梓華建議李宇軒繼續協助 IPAC 的工作，負責網站編輯及發布文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方李宇軒向日議員交制裁草案協助翻譯推立法&quot;&gt;控方：李宇軒向日議員交制裁草案、協助翻譯推立法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「日本線」方面，李宇軒於2020年1月至4月，向3名日本眾議院議員提交有關「馬格尼茨基式」制裁的草案，並將 IPAC 的會議紀錄翻譯成日文，以協助菅野志櫻里推動《馬格尼茨基人權法案》立法。李又與裴倫德等人討論 SWHK 可如何協助 IPAC 和由日本議員組成的「對中政策相關國會議員聯盟（JPAC）」，其中 Bill Browder 和菅野志櫻里原擬會面討論該法案，但該視像會議終因李宇軒被捕而未成事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方並指，李宇軒在黎智英透過 Mark Simon 和陳梓華的指示下，執行和管理 SWHK 的事務，與外國政治人物建立網絡、進行國際游說，請求外國制裁中國；負責 SWHK 會計紀錄，批出團隊活動開支；亦負責編輯 SWHK 的網頁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方swhk發布多篇文章籲制裁致函外國政府促停引渡協議&quot;&gt;控方：SWHK發布多篇文章籲制裁、致函外國政府促停引渡協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另指，在黎智英及 Mark Simon 透過陳梓華指示下，李宇軒本人或透過 SWHK，發布一系列文章、新聞稿和制裁名單，以促請制裁。其中2019年12月，SWHK 發布一份與香港大專學界國際事務代表團制作，針對144名中港官員的制裁名單；2020年7月1日，SWHK 發布題為〈Darkness is descending on freedom and democracy in Hong Kong, a leading global campaigning organisation has warned〉的新聞稿，譴責《國安法》頒布，並呼籲英政府急切考慮對中國及香港實施馬格尼茨基式制裁、及撤銷與香港的引渡協議，並對中國國企如華為施加限制。同年7月17日，SWHK 致函捷克、愛爾蘭及葡萄牙政府，促請她們終止與香港的引渡協議，3封信於李的電腦搜得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7月期間，SWHK 亦多次在 Twitter 轉發外國政治人物的帖文，如轉發美國議員帖文，感謝他們投票通過《香港自治法案》；轉發 Bill Browder 帖文呼籲制裁中港官員；轉發美國白宮帖文，感謝美國取消香港「特別待遇」和對中國施加關稅；及轉發羅冠聰帖文，促請國際社會對前特首和選舉主任進行制裁等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SWHK亦曾於7至8月發布數篇文章，包括〈The destruction of the democratic process in Hong Kong〉，呼籲美國對中港進行制裁，並於2021年1月發布由數個海外組織聯署的聲明，促請美政府啟動「救生艇」政策及英國政府實施對中港制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱黎智英2013至2020年期間-向民主派課金逾9千萬元&quot;&gt;控方稱黎智英2013至2020年期間 向民主派課金逾9千萬元&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就資金流向，控方指在2013年7月至2020年7月期間，黎智英共86次轉帳予 Mark Simon，款項達1億1,860萬元。其中9,326萬元再被分配給不同民主派人士及政黨。此外，黎智英於2019年10月18日指示 Mark Simon，將25,819.15元美金（即港幣約202,163.94元）捐給「香港監察」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;稅務局的資料顯示在2013至2020年期間，Mark Simon 報稱為壹傳媒動畫公司的職員，年薪為110至120萬元。在2020至2021年期間，Mark Simon 亦報稱為力高顧問有限公司的商業經理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒被捕後獲警方擔保-惟其後被內地水警截獲-終移交回港&quot;&gt;李宇軒被捕後獲警方擔保 惟其後被內地水警截獲 終移交回港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就各被告的被捕情況，控方指，李宇軒於2020年8月10日被警方以「勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」、「無牌管有槍械或彈藥」、「藏有可作非法用途的工具」及「洗黑錢」罪拘捕。8月12日李獲警方擔保，惟須交出護照等旅遊證件及不得離港，並須於同年9月1日到警署報到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟8月23日李乘船非法闖入中國水域時被內地水警拘捕。至2021年3月22日，李從中國被移交至香港警方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華2021年2月還柙至今-劉祖廸和mark-simon於2020年離港&quot;&gt;陳梓華2021年2月還柙至今 劉祖廸和Mark Simon於2020年離港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於陳梓華於2020年10月10日被警方以「協助罪犯」罪名拘捕，其後獲警方擔保。同年10至11月，Mark Simon 向陳說自己可能會因國安法罪名而被捕，但鼓勵陳繼續國際游說工作，Mark Simon 並向陳保證黎智英及他會提供一切協助，包括提供逃往美國的路線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2021年2月15日，陳再度被警方以「勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」罪拘捕，其後一直還柙至今。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於劉祖廸和 Mark Simon，則分別於2020年1月5日及4月18日經出境關口離開香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英於2020年8月10日首次被捕。其後於9月1日，黎進行警誡錄影會面，警員向他展示部份專欄文章，他承認作者是自己。黎亦承認 Twitter 帳戶屬於他持有及使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方3法案通過立法-42名官員被制裁&quot;&gt;控方：3法案通過立法 42名官員被制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後指，在涉案時段，外國推行不同法案及政策，以制裁中港官員、限制貿易和出入口，以及延長港人外國居留期限等。包括2019年6月13日，《香港人權及民主法案》（The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act）在美國眾議院審議，並於同年11月27日獲時任美國總統特朗普簽署立法。2020年6月30日，美國議員提出《香港避風港法案》（Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act），相關立法程序仍在進行中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月14日特朗普正式簽署《香港自治法》（Hong Kong Autonomy Act）。法案授權美國政府制裁有份損害香港自治的中國及香港官員、機構或企業。同日，特朗普簽署《香港正常化總統行政命令》（President’s Executive Order 13936 on Hong Kong Normalization），暫緩或取消對香港的部份特別待遇，以及授權美政府實施制裁措施。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021年6月30日，美國有議員提出《香港人自由和選擇法》（Hong Kong People’s Freedom and Choice Act），要求為合資格的港人提供臨時庇護和難民身份，以及其他有關移居美國的措施，相關立法程序仍在進行中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月至2021年7月期間，美國向42名中央及香港特區政府官員實施制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月11日，美國政府宣布由同年9月25日起，從香港進口美國的產品須註明原產地是「中國」，而不能標示「香港」。2020年8月19日，美國國務院宣布終止與香港簽署的三項雙邊協議，包括逃犯的移交、被判刑人士的移交、豁免國際船運利得稅。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，約於2020年11月9日，英國、愛爾蘭、澳洲、紐西蘭等9個國家分別暫緩與香港之間的逃犯移交協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，香港城市大學法律學院教授、梁美芬丈夫王貴國會以美國法律和國際經濟法的專家身份出庭作供，講述制裁及封鎖措施的法律效力，包括影響、後果及時效等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;下周一續審-料將讀出同意事實&quot;&gt;下周一續審 料將讀出同意事實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方讀畢179頁的開案陳詞，表示原預計傳召60名證人，但可減至31人，並望減至30人以下。控方亦將讀出同意事實，但望法庭給予時間與辯方商討，以視乎可否同意更多事實。案件下周一（8日）續審，將讀出同意事實。&lt;/p&gt;

The trade war, the pandemic, growing technology competition, rising tensions in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, and contrasting approaches to the Russia-Ukraine conflict have collectively fed a sense of fatalism that they were heading toward the outright economic decoupling and military conflict.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summit meeting between Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping held in November near San Francisco, just in advance of the APEC Economic Leaders’ Week, was the culmination of a year-long process that calmed the waters. The two sides announced a range of deliverables on economic and security issues and tried to convey a sense that they could effectively manage their differences. Although the United States and China are still engaged in a comprehensive contest for power and over setting the global rules of the game, guardrails are gradually being created, and as a result, the likelihood of the most disastrous outcomes has receded. Moreover, even though the chances of a genuine thaw that resolves fundamental differences and leads to greater cooperation are low, there also are underappreciated sources of structural stability that could keep relations from further deteriorating in the coming years. Nevertheless, it will take active diplomacy and some good luck to keep ties from fraying in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;surpassing-low-expectations&quot;&gt;Surpassing Low Expectations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During their four-hour meeting on the Filoli Estate in Woodside, California, both Biden and Xi appeared to stick to their original positions on technology and economic security, Taiwan, Ukraine, human rights, and several other issues. At the same time, they were able to produce a series of deliverables exceeding the expectations of most analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the readouts from the White House and People’s Republic of China (PRC) media (Xinhua, Caixin), it appears that, at a minimum, the two sides agreed to several actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resume military-to-military dialogue through a variety of channels and on a number of specific topics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Commit to accelerate efforts to expand renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions, including from methane and other greenhouse gases, in accordance with the joint statement issued at Sunnylands just before the bilateral meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Restore and expand cooperation on countering the production and trafficking of fentanyl and other narcotics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step up discussions to minimize risks related to artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Push for more direct flights between the two countries and expand people-to-people exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Begin consultations aimed at renewing the U.S.-China Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement, which is set to expire in late February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond specific actions, the two sides adjusted the tone of how they frame the relationship. The Biden administration’s readout said the two sides “are in competition,” dropping the previously ubiquitous adjective “strategic” from the characterization of ties. U.S. officials have continued to avoid using the “s” word in public statements. In place of the highly critical language about the United States and the Biden administration that have been dominant in the past few years, Chinese state media coverage has consistently highlighted the friendly and respectful nature of the meeting and has presented a hopeful vision for future ties. Chinese ambassador Xie Feng’s speech to the U.S.-China Business Council’s annual gala in mid-December is perhaps the best example of this major shift in tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;different-roads-to-san-francisco&quot;&gt;Different Roads to San Francisco&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and China both wanted the meeting to be successful, but their leaders arrived in San Francisco on very different trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden came in with the wind at his back. The U.S. economy has recovered; growth has regained momentum, while inflation has slowed. Although Congress seems locked in eternal battles internally and with the executive branch, it did adopt, in consultation with the administration, major pieces of legislation — the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the CHIPS and Science Act — that will provide a stronger foundation for the U.S. economy in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the United States’ relations with allies in Asia and Europe have improved dramatically in general and with respect to their approach toward China in particular. Analysis of the challenge China poses on economic and national security issues sounds increasingly similar whether one is in Tokyo, Berlin, Brussels, Washington, or other advanced market democracies. Closer alignment has been generated by China’s increasingly ambitious and distortionary industrial policies, the human rights situation in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, China’s close ties with Russia and its approach to Ukraine, instances of economic coercion by Beijing, and the worsening security situation in the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and along the China-India border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrowing of differences reflects a greater willingness by the Biden administration, relative to its predecessor, to develop a foreign policy framework rooted in longtime alignments with allies, as well as a willingness to shift its own language and approach in a way that is more comfortable to friends in Europe and Asia. This certainly applies to the administration’s emphasis since the spring of 2023 that it is pursuing “de-risking,” not decoupling. At the same time, likeminded countries have become more willing to be openly critical of China and develop a range of policy responses, individually and together with others. This is most visible in the area of economic security, for example, with Japan’s Economic Security Promotion Act and the European Commission’s investigation into subsidies for China’s electric vehicle (EV) sector. Although there are still significant frictions — U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum, different approaches to data security and privacy, and disagreement over how to reform the World Trade Organization (WTO) — the dramatic reduction in differences between Washington and its allies is the more important trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Xi, by contrast, came in facing substantial domestic and international headwinds as a result of his changing policies at home and abroad. China’s zero-Covid policies, which initially were successful in 2020 and 2021, proved to be a failure in 2022 in the face of the Omicron variant. Lockdowns in Shanghai and elsewhere generated widespread anger, and the sudden removal of restrictions in late 2022 in the face of protests left many Chinese people feeling abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic front has brought a long string of bad news: the extended crackdown on the private tech sector, the imposition of a range of national security–oriented laws, the shrinking of the workforce and graying of the population, the property market’s woes, and growing restrictions on access to Western markets and technology. China’s economy may meet its official economic growth target for 2023 of around five percent, but the recovery has been far slower than expected, and the sense of inevitable continued economic success has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s record abroad has been equally problematic. Tensions with the United States, growing frictions in the Taiwan Strait, and alignment with Russia have brought the United States and its allies together. Access to Western technology and markets has been constrained, and global supply chains are gradually reducing their disproportionate reliance on China. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has attracted criticism for failed projects that have added to the debt load of developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of problems at home and abroad has led to a crisis of confidence among Chinese citizens, who have become far less certain about their individual and collective futures than at any time in the last three decades. Xi Jinping himself may exude self-confidence and believe that the “East is rising and the West is declining,” but he has not persuaded his populace of this prediction. Hence, Xi needs to stabilize relations with the United States and the West more generally, not only for foreign policy reasons but to rebuild confidence at home, which is central to generating growth and maintaining social stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why China’s bark has been bigger than its bite. Xi attended the APEC summit and held the bilateral meeting with Biden despite the fact that Washington made essentially no concessions to get Xi to California. In the months leading up to APEC, the administration issued an executive order on outbound investment, stepped up export controls on the semiconductor industry, and held firm in not inviting Hong Kong chief executive John Lee to the APEC leaders’ meeting. Beijing has sent signals of potential penalties through its investigation into a few consulting firms and by placing several minerals on its export control list, but it has not pulled the trigger on any of these yet, fearful that doing so would accelerate the decoupling it still hopes to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sources-of-stability&quot;&gt;Sources of Stability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s problems at home and abroad have left the impression that his conciliatory moves are tactical gestures that will be only temporary and fade away once China’s economy rebounds and domestic confidence in his leadership is restored or will disappear suddenly if Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s current vice president and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate, wins Taiwan’s presidential election in mid-January and China is compelled to react with dramatic moves. Such concerns are entirely reasonable, but observers should appreciate that the sources of recent tempering of stresses are rooted in three structural characteristics of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The credible military deterrents that the United States and China both maintain against the other form the first source of stability. China’s relative power has risen dramatically in recent years, and the United States and others take as credible Chinese threats to use force in the Taiwan Strait if Taiwan were to cross any of Beijing’s red lines. Conversely, the U.S. credibility to provide defensive support to Taiwan and its allies has been strengthened through the development of the Quad and AUKUS, improved bilateral relations with countries around China’s periphery, and its support to Ukraine. Equally important, although there are “green” and “blue” wings in Taiwan’s political spectrum regarding their ideal preferences for cross-strait outcomes, in the context of realistic constraints, the vast majority of the population — and the political parties — are one or another shade of turquoise. In sum, the astronomical costs of an outbreak of hostilities have created a widely shared preference in favor of maintaining the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, although U.S.-China bilateral trade and investment ties have stagnated, the two countries are still embedded in an extensive web of complex interdependence across all aspects of their economies and broader societies, which extends to countries around the world. Interconnectivity has created certain vulnerabilities, such as overdependence for critical goods and the potential transfer of dual-use technologies, but it also has created extensive economic and national security benefits that raise the costs of conflict and the value of continued interaction to both sides. Understandably, neither side is keen to abandon such ties. The fact that other countries are deeply connected to the United States and China further raises the costs to Washington and Beijing from taking precipitous actions. Interdependence is no panacea, but it is a structural feature shaping the choices of all parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the resumption of regular people-to-people ties, track 2 dialogues, and official consultations, in the wake of their collapse due to the Covid-19 pandemic, provides another set of stabilizers. Washington and Beijing have established roughly a dozen working groups on a wide range of topics, and the two governments now have normal interactions at the cabinet and working levels. So far there has been one recent congressional delegation, in October 2023, and there likely will be more in 2024. Communication does not necessarily generate momentum for extensive cooperation, but it provides pathways for reducing misunderstanding about policies and broader developments in both countries and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-ahead-to-2024&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead to 2024&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new normal of what could be called “competition without conflict” does not presage a return to the era of engagement, but the United States and China deserve credit for reducing the chances of the worst negative tail risks, including outright decoupling and military conflict. That said, the short-term incentives and long-term structural features of relations guarantee absolutely nothing. Maintaining momentum in 2024 will require a series of steps on the domestic, bilateral, and multilateral fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most urgently, every effort must be taken to avoid an escalation of tensions and outright conflict in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. The outcome of the Taiwan election is in doubt, but there should be no doubt that all sides need to act with prudence once the results are announced, and that extraordinary vigilance will be needed through the inauguration of Taiwan’s next leader in May and their first few months in office. Equally complex will be finding a way to defuse tensions involving China and the Philippines around Second Thomas Shoal in the face of Beijing’s increasingly aggressive moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, with the creation of new channels for dialogue, the United States and China need to move forward with consultations on all fronts, including on trade, technology, artificial intelligence, climate, and security issues. Given the previous dearth of communication, discussion itself will be valuable, but before long it will be reasonable to expect the two sides to refine their agenda in each working group and gradually shift from consultations to negotiations that deliver substantive results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be equally important for the Biden administration to expand and deepen consultations and coordination with allies in Europe and Asia on China policy. General agreement about de-risking needs to be accompanied by more concrete alignment or harmonization with regard to the implementation of economic security in a range of sectors (semiconductors, EVs, and critical minerals being the most urgent), rules related to the digital economy, carrying out commitments from the latest UN Climate Change Conference (COP28), and how to resuscitate the WTO and keep the global trading system from collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Biden administration needs to further develop the architecture of its China policy. The administration deserves credit for putting meat on the bones of its three-pronged strategy of “invest, align and compete,” enunciating the goal of de-risking while maintaining extensive economic ties, and resuming extensive dialogue. It can build on this progress by clarifying the goals of its China policy. This begins by further articulating how the United States aims to strengthen and reform the rules-based international order and then, on that basis, how relations with China should be managed in light of those broader goals. Equally important is to begin an evaluation of the effectiveness of its approach across a range of areas. For example, what are the right metrics to measure progress with regard to advancement of American technology innovation, reduced overdependence on China, and the imposition of security-based restrictions on Chinese industry? That will then offer a foundation for judging whether U.S. policy is making progress, having unintended consequences, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, in 2024 the Biden administration needs to take steps to institutionalize the various elements of its China policy. Doing so could mean making measurable progress and having a less volatile year than many foresee, which would make its approach less vulnerable to criticism from Beijing, other countries, and other domestic perspectives. The last source of disagreement is particularly important given that China policy undoubtedly will be a central topic of discussion in the lead-up to the United States’ congressional and presidential elections in November.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方：黎智英籲下屬勿針對特朗普 指示Mark Simon邀彭斯和蓬佩奧訂閱英文版&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mLxOlOK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（3日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第5日審訊。控方繼續開案陳詞，指黎智英在美國國務院前資深顧問 Christian Whiton 的建議下，指示下屬設立蘋果英文版，目的是爭取外國人的支持，以尋求外力向中央及香港政府實施制裁。黎又指示國際組同事不要針對特朗普，因蘋果靠特朗普政府的支持「保命」。當黃之鋒表示不認同蘋果發起的「一人一信救香港」行動，黎則向陳沛敏表示不同意黃，現時任何有助於香港的方法都應該採用，因已沒有其他方法對付中共。控方又指黎於2020年5月開設了個人 Twitter 帳戶，以圖增加影響力打「國際線」，列出黎智英所追蹤的外國政治人物及機構，遭法官質疑控方想反映什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎智英fcc演講獲蘋果報導-另指示下屬訪問彭定康&quot;&gt;控方：黎智英FCC演講獲蘋果報導 另指示下屬訪問彭定康&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方昨日開案陳詞提到，黎智英對《蘋果日報》的日常運作有完全的控制權，他會給予指示其他同案被告，是串謀犯罪的「主腦」。控方今天繼續開案陳詞，就發布煽動刊物罪，控方指2019年4月，黎智英指示張劍虹訪問「銅鑼灣書店」前店長林榮基，希望報導能有效地引發市民上街反送中。黎智英亦吩咐張想想如何推動更多人參與遊行，並向張轉發訊息，顯示黎早前請求「香港監察」創辦人 Benedict Rogers 聯絡前港督彭定康，採訪其對反送中的評論，後來相關報導於2019年4月28日刊出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年5月21日，黎智英在外國記者協會場合發表演講，後來《蘋果日報》報導演講內容，題為〈送中惡法 黎智英：修例後香港玩完 FCC演講斥林鄭非常邪惡〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方反送中運動開始後-蘋果報導及黎智英專欄文章煽動對政府仇恨&quot;&gt;控方：反送中運動開始後 蘋果報導及黎智英專欄文章煽動對政府仇恨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2019年6月9日的反修例大遊行標誌著「社會騷動」的開始。雖然政府其後宣布暫緩以至撤回修例草案，但暴力示威浪潮持續。在這社會背景下，《蘋果日報》發布不同內容，包括針對中央政府及香港特區政府的煽動性陳述、呼籲市民參與示威、宣揚對警察的憎恨、提倡透過非法、暴力及「攬炒」手段來對抗中央及特區政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方列出31篇從2019年6月15日至2020年1月26日期間發布的文章，指稱它們具煽動性：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈和變勇 「是政權，逼我進化」〉：控方指稱文章意圖激起市民對中央政府及香港特區政府的憎恨&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈天下制裁集會 今勢逼爆遮打〉：控方引述內容「2020年才過了不足20天，林鄭月娥政府已經急不及待要『推動』逆權運動另一浪高潮。民政事務專員擅離職守架空區議會、警察喬裝市民濫捕公眾場所拍照少年、監警會借故延遲提交報告……種種事端都有意無意為刻下看似已緩和的民怨重新撥火。民間集會團隊呼籲港人今日再集結，向國際社會展示民意，冀求各國政府向迫害港人的香港官員與警察落實制裁措施。」控方指稱文章意圖激起市民對中央政府及香港特區政府的憎恨&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈社會專題：自己手足自己救〉&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈屠龍隊邊緣呼喚 全民勇武／三罷〉：文章提到「隊名『層龍，對抗警察是家常便飯，有人試過被警棍打穿頭，亦有人遭橡膠子彈爆頭險死，但他們明白不是每個人都有這種勇氣。」控方指文章意圖引起對警方的仇恨&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈港鐵大搜捕 釀元朗恐襲2.0 速龍無差別毆打市民〉&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;廣告〈誰殺死他她他和她……〉&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;廣告〈一次過變黑又得 逐漸變黑又得 黑晒！〉&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈攬炒巴×G20 團隊 眾籌1,400萬連登13國賣廣告 推爆警暴〉：控方指稱文章意圖提倡透過非法、暴力及「攬炒」手段來對抗中央及特區政府&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，從2019年6月15日至2020年1月16日，黎智英透過其個人專欄「成敗樂一笑」發表評論文章，旨在煽動市民對中央、特區政府和警察的仇恨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈我們堅持下去，才有希望〉&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈反極權 台灣更不用怕〉：控方引文「中共可怕的地方是，把人當成是純綷被物質驅使的動物，而不是有靈性和精神面貌的人。」、「在中共金錢萬能的思維世界裡，自由如糞土，人民只是極權機器中的螺絲，最後只會令他們在這資訊開放的時代無地自容。」&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈2020 和勇繼續一起撐下去〉：黎在文中稱2020年元旦與李柱銘及何俊仁參與遊行，途中見到有一名年約14至15歲的少女大叫「黑警死全家」、「香港差佬，X你老母」。黎向何說：「有這樣的後生，我哋冇得輸。」黎續指，不知道「裝修」滙豐銀行的，是否「我們的勇武手足」，但打爆中國人壽店舖玻璃的兩名黑衣人便十分可疑，現場有人質疑二人是喬裝警員。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈捍道德抗極權 全球人人有責〉&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年7月2日，黎智英指示陳沛敏報導示威者七一佔領立法會事件，以引起市民對年輕示威者的同情和支持。同年7月19日，黎智英向陳沛敏轉述 Benedict Rogers 的要求，轉述美國眾議員 Ted Yoho 有意投稿。同年10月，黎智英與美國眾議院議長佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi）會面後，黎要求陳訪問她。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方疫情爆發後-蘋果持續煽動&quot;&gt;控方：疫情爆發後 蘋果持續煽動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年1月底開始，新冠肺炎在香港爆發，令示威活動暫時沉寂，但《蘋果日報》持續發布內容，針對中央政府及香港特區政府的煽動性陳述、宣揚對警察的憎恨，以及提倡透過非法及暴力的手段來對抗中央及特區政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;〈擬用反恐例 控爆炸品案 鄧炳強學新疆鐵腕壓抗爭〉：控方指內容有意煽動對警察的仇恨，以及提倡使用不守法及暴力手段。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另指黎智英5篇專欄文章含煽動內容：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈現代人不是西方文明機制外生存的動物〉&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈武漢瘟疫 中共喪鐘〉：「肺炎疫情在中共維穩大前提下，謊言泛濫真相模糊，層層官僚架構層層謊言重疊，肺炎災情有多深重，就是中共也不知道。謊言治國不講誠信難服眾，習帝靠的是極權操控，絕對扼殺人民資訊自由，把人民變成盲從的羊群，管治便乾脆脷落。」、「習帝的極權控制了所有資訊，連拍電影現在也找不到題材了。」、「人民噤聲，政府霸道，惡毒病菌肆虐橫行，受苦的最後是人民。」&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈我們最光輝的時刻〉&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈專橫暴政打壓 我們氣魄不滅〉：「今日我們明知有事，中共打到嚟必然大清算大清洗，清算不聽話的人，清洗英國殖民地遺留下來保護港人自由的法治和機制，把香港人變成任由習帝擺佈的奴才，因此我們會繼續起來抗爭到底，希望趁習帝內外危機四伏，和慘遭武漢肺炎瘟疫人命摧殘和經濟淪陷後，各國尤其美國向中國責難及局部制裁，迫使中共不敢太明目張膽，暫時克制對香港的迫害」&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈無賴在摧毀香港法治〉&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方在美國國務院前資深顧問建議下-黎智英指示設蘋果英文版&quot;&gt;控方：在美國國務院前資深顧問建議下 黎智英指示設蘋果英文版&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指2020年5月，有傳媒報導人大打算在香港實施《國安法》，其時黎智英已開始從事針對中央的敵對活動，支持或提出請求外國勢力向中央及特區政府實施制裁或封鎖。早於同年4月，美國國務院前資深顧問 Christian Whiton 電郵向黎智英提議設英文版，黎智英便指示下屬設立《蘋果日報》英文版，以尋求外力向中央及香港政府實施制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎智英與 Christian Whiton 之間的對話，後者在2020年4月17日指設立《蘋果日報》英文版在政治上有好處。4月19日，Mark Simon 向黎指英文版原意是好，但可能不符成本效益。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;群組對話顯示黎稱不需做平衡報導-指示應集中保衛香港的聲音&quot;&gt;群組對話顯示黎稱不需做平衡報導 指示應集中「保衛香港的聲音」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2020年5月10日，黎智英創立 WhatsApp 群組「English news」，其他成員包括張劍虹、陳沛敏、羅偉光、馮偉光及張志偉。他們其後討論英文版的運作方式，黎提出請求美國政治領袖去訂閱，以得到他們的支持（“By enlisting foreign leaders to subscribe to us is enlisting their support.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎強調不需全面地向外國人展示香港的不同政治派別，只需要聚焦在「蘋果日報觀點，即黃營的一般觀點」。（“We only concentrate in our Apple Daily HK view, a general view of the yellow side.”) 黎又指不需要做平衡報導，因保衛香港的聲音需要被世界聽見。（“We are not trying to strike a balance but the point of view of the people on the side of protecting HK. This is the voice the world wants to know.”）直至黎智英被拘捕之前，該群組一直有持續運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指示mark-simon邀請彭斯和蓬佩奧等人訂閱蘋果英文版&quot;&gt;黎智英指示Mark Simon邀請彭斯和蓬佩奧等人訂閱蘋果英文版&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英亦與 Mark Simon 討論，黎指引入英文版可吸引美國人及其他外國人支持，遂指示 Mark Simon 協助宣傳，以及邀請時任美國副總統彭斯和時任國務卿蓬佩奧訂閱。黎其後表示聽聞有一些撰稿人不想再替《南華早報》寫文章，提議可邀請他們供稿予蘋果英文版，籲 Mark Simon 聯絡南華早報前總編輯 Mark Clifford 商討。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎其後指出，英文版除了讓支持反修例運動的美國人有方法訂閱蘋果之外，若果彭斯（Mike Pence）、蓬佩奧（Mike Pompeo）和共和黨參議員 Marco Rubio 等外國官員都訂閱的話，可在政治上保護到蘋果，因蘋果現時是中聯辦的針對目標，而外國支持是黎的關注點。黎決定英文版每天發布約10至12篇報導、專題和評論文章，另加8至10篇關於中國內地的文章，目標對象是美國讀者，希望打破《南華早報》的壟斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英亦向張劍虹提議在英文版加入台灣的報導，以吸引美國人的注意。張回覆：「老闆，一定需要的，中美大戰，台灣重要，必須要加的，謝謝」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方列黎智英twitter追蹤名單-官質疑可反映什麼&quot;&gt;控方列黎智英Twitter追蹤名單 官質疑可反映什麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指在大約同一時間，黎於2020年5月開設了個人 Twitter 帳戶，以圖增加影響力打「國際線」。帖文不時標示美國、英國、日本及台灣的政治人物，與他們互相交流。而李兆富（Simon Lee）則負責管理黎的 Twitter 帳戶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方列出黎智英 Twitter 帳戶追蹤的多名外國政治人物，包括時任美國副總統彭斯、時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧、Natan Sharansky、台灣領導人蔡英文、「香港監察」創辦人 Benedict Rogers、「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」創辦人兼執行董事 Luke de Pulford、「Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong. 重光團隊」、對華政策跨國議會聯盟、前香港大專學界國際事務代表團發言人邵嵐、美國國會及行政當局中國委員會、美國眾議院外交委員會、美軍前副參謀長 Jack Keane、美國參議員 Ted Cruz、《華爾街日報》編輯 Bill McGurn。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，控方列出黎追蹤的帳戶是想顯示什麼？控方代表周天行則指名單可顯示到黎的「聯繫」，李官指「聯繫」的意思可以很廣闊。周天行指可反映黎與上述人士在 Twitter 上有交流，以及犯案時的心思意念（state of mind），即黎是知悉自己在做什麼，並且有相關意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英曾指示蘋果員工不要針對特朗普-因蘋果靠其支保命&quot;&gt;黎智英曾指示蘋果員工不要針對特朗普 因蘋果靠其支「保命」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同年5月25日，《蘋果》發布一篇文章題為〈打國際線 蘋果英文版免費試睇〉，內容表示香港的人權被中共侵犯，英文版可供國際的朋友認識香港的狀況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英宣傳英文版時提及，多人訂閱不但可提供經濟上的支持，亦可保護《蘋果》免受政治打壓。黎智英又指示國際組同事「不要跟紐約時報及CNN針對川普，我們蘋果卻要靠川普政府支持保命」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月16日，《蘋果》發布彭定康支持訂閱的宣傳短片，題為「彭定康拍片撐新聞自由：每日一蘋果全為你好」。黎智英其後指示張劍虹安排《蘋果》發起「一人一信救香港」，呼籲香港人寫信給時任美國總統特朗普，並提供書信範本及步驟。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃之鋒對「一人一信救香港」持不同意見，並在社交媒體稱「冇理由叫人哋國家嘅總統SaveHK」。陳沛敏把相關帖文 WhatsApp 發送給黎，黎則回應他不同意黃的觀點，現時任何有助於香港的方法都應該採用，雖然他知道很多人不同意「一人一信救香港」行動，包括李柱銘，但唯一出路就是要勇敢起來，因已沒有其他方法對付中共。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方國安法生效後-黎智英在網上直播對談節目談制裁&quot;&gt;控方：國安法生效後 黎智英在網上直播對談節目談制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，當《國安法》於2020年6月30日晚上11時生效，《蘋果》隨即發布一篇題為〈惡法生效 兩制蓋棺 泛民7.1繼續抗爭〉的新聞報導，實體報紙亦夾附一張海報，寫有「Fight For Freedom 為自由抗爭」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時《蘋果》製作了新的網上直播節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」，首次播出時間為7月9日，題為「Live Q&amp;amp;A with Jimmy Lai」，黎在節目中表示以後會每週播放，並對《國安法》作出批評。之後的集數則邀請不同人士與黎智英對談，包括南華早報及英文虎報前總編輯 Mark Clifford、前港督彭定康 Chris Patten、Benedict Rogers、Jack Keane、前美國外交官 Raymond Burghardt、美國前副國防部長 Paul Wolfowitz、Natan Sharansky、美國記者兼時評作家 Nicholas Kristof 等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方列舉黎智英在節目中的言論，並在庭上播放影片。黎以英語形容《國安法》生效後香港會「玩完」，若果美國取消香港特殊地位的話，意味關上中國通向世界的窗口，中國會更易接受美國的要求，因此黎支持美國取消香港特殊地位，因在國安法下特殊地位變得無意義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又指，歐洲國家應與美國聯合一起對付中國，制裁措施可以拖慢中國的通訊科技和晶片科技發展和研究，影響「華為」手機和中端科技（CTE）等企業。屆時台灣將會成為亞洲的科技樞紐，而中國則會逐漸衰退，最終使習近平讓步及立場軟化。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黎智英被捕後繼續辦節目-稱有機會被起訴勾結-籲海外人士繼續發聲&quot;&gt;控方指黎智英被捕後繼續辦節目 稱有機會被起訴勾結 籲海外人士繼續發聲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在2020年8月10日首次被拘捕，即使如此，黎在同月13日繼續舉行直播節目，並在 Twitter 稱「the show has to go on」。黎又在其後的節目中稱自己被捕一事顯示香港人正面對一個怎樣的政權，並批評香港政府隨意拘捕及是極權，猶如「俄羅斯入侵烏克蘭」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在另一集節目，黎智英與 Benedict Rogers 對談時提到，他自己有機會被控告「勾結外國勢力」，所以海外人士的聲音變得重要，呼籲 Benedict Rogers 繼續堅持他的工作，並感謝他所做的工作，又形容國際社會是香港人的「救星」（savior）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年11月13日的節目中，前港督彭定康指中共是香港自由民主的威脅，如果想中國改變的話，要持續為香港勇敢走出來。有觀眾問國際社會可以做什麼，黎智英表示，民主派聲音將在立法會消失，意味國際社會可能再也聽不到香港的聲音，「香港可以講係喺窒息之中」，所以新聞很重要，可以令世界繼續留意香港並為香港發聲，「如果世界忘記咗我哋，就會好大鑊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英在另一次節目中強調，不可以向中國認輸，而他現時與不同外國人士交流，面對被起訴「勾結外國勢力」的風險，但他必須堅持及繼續手上的工作。黎又提到，很多人崇拜他，使他肩負很多責任，一方面感到責任重大，另一方面感到振奮，因他有這樣的身位去做如此美妙的工作（wonderful thing），沒有放棄的理由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英稱特朗普較難以捉摸-於中國而言比拜登更危險&quot;&gt;黎智英稱特朗普較難以捉摸 於中國而言比拜登更「危險」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英在其後的集數中指，制裁不會帶來最大的破壞，最大的破壞是中美對立局面導致開戰，若果中美之間開戰的話，會帶來不確定性，最終沒有人敢來中國投資。不過黎指，若果美國與亞洲國家愈走愈近，最後孤立中國的話，便會削弱中國應對戰爭的力量，所以他認為未來中美不會開戰。另一個黎認為不會開戰的原因，是若果開戰的話，外國將不會運送石油給中國，而中國並未準備好開戰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有聽眾問到海外人士在美國大選應怎樣做，黎智英則指對中國來說，特朗普（Donald Trump）比拜登（Joe Biden）更「危險」，因特朗普比較難以捉摸，認為他當選是很重要。黎在一集與彭定康對談時表示，對於拜登採取「多邊主義」外交手法並不抱希望，因各個國家對中國採取不同做法，導致削弱整體立場，籲拜登對中國強硬，又鼓勵海外人士游說外國官員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦呼籲美國更多連繫太平洋亞洲，因他們是未來最大的經濟市場。就台灣局勢，黎形容美國是台灣的「國防後盾」（security backbone），無可避免地會提升軍事和經濟支援予台灣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審，控方將繼續開案陳詞及播放「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」片段。&lt;/p&gt;

Poring through the numerous senior-level engagements and outcome documents, the relationship largely remains in the “agenda-setting mode”. However, as indicated by the types of engagements and frequency — one can expect concrete outcomes soon. Notably, China remains a driving imperative behind U.S.-India strategic and commercial relations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there were several tangible steps marking important shifts in U.S.-India relations. I have outlined five big events from the past year and underscored their larger implications. Additionally, I have also linked the work produced by the CSIS India Chair on the five subjects to provide additional detail. The events are not chronological but rather in the order of significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/L6R77xc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GE Engine Deal, June 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; General Electric and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited announced an agreement to co-produce the F-414 engine for India’s domestic “Tejas” light fighter. The two governments first announced plans to work towards co-production of jet engines in January 2015, but discussions soon died off.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Significance:&lt;/em&gt; This agreement underscores growing U.S. trust in India, based on shared security concerns. Helping India improve defense production will also reduce India’s continued reliance on Russian-made defense equipment. This agreement also shows that ideas which may have failed a decade ago can be successfully revisited.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dropping WTO Disputes, June 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to Washington in June, the two governments agreed to drop six outstanding disputes before the World Trade Organization. The seventh and final dispute was dropped during President Biden’s visit to India in September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Significance:&lt;/em&gt; Trade policy remains one of the weakest areas of bilateral government engagement. While the two sides have made some progress in discussions over areas of strategically significant trade, general trade concerns fester. Utilizing leader-level summits to end disputes might be an “overkill,” but it shows growing recognition from both nations that improving commercial ties is crucial for the long-term sustainability of the relationship. However, as I noted in an earlier piece, despite the significance of the measures, a comprehensive framework akin to the Australian government’s 2018 India Economic Strategy would be momentous for bilateral commercial relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combined Maritime Force Bahrain, November 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; While the American and Indian militaries regularly conduct exercises, there is a dearth of practical military cooperation. That changed at the India-U.S. 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue in November, in Delhi when India announced it would join the 28-member “Combined Maritime Forces” naval partnership based in Bahrain.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Significance:&lt;/em&gt; India’s membership of the CMF provides a new, regularized venue for U.S.-India interoperability training. We may soon witness more regular joint security missions in the Gulf to counter piracy, smuggling, and other illicit operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York Assassination Attempt Indictment, November 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; As the year was nearing its close, U.S.-India relations were shook with the unsealing of an indictment in the Southern District of New York. The indictment alleged a plot outlining an Indian intelligence officer’s involvement in the attempted assassination of a Sikh separatist who is an American citizen. As this case moves ahead, there will likely be other closely watched moments that could alter the trajectory of U.S.-India ties&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Significance:&lt;/em&gt; American policy circles are already replete with critics of India’s recent record in areas like religious tolerance and human rights. While the Biden Administration has chosen — so far — to press ahead on cooperation, the assassination attempt further strengthens these critics and raises fundamental questions about the depth of our “shared values.” As noted by my colleague Katherine Hadda, the United States’ approach to focus on a specific Indian official rather than implicating the entire government is pragmatic. Most likely, reasonable action from India in response to these allegations will suffice to maintain the relationship’s momentum. However, the event adds uncertainty to the relationship. Other steps by the Modi government that shrink the civil society space can further move these currents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steep Drop in FDI:&lt;/strong&gt; Media reports of significant investments by foreign technology firms into India engenders the feeling that “Make in India,” paired with increased trade pressure on China, has finally started to build momentum. However, the government of India’s own data proves otherwise. According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Monthly Bulletin data, India saw a 27 percent year-on-year drop in 12-month foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow (new equity) and a 43 percent drop in FDI inflow from the mid-2021 peak. World Bank data shows manufacturing stuck at around 13 percent of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). One major potential investor, Foxconn, dropped its massive $20 billion chip venture with Vedanta this summer. However, there are some “green shoots” that foreign investment might finally be shifting back towards India — including a healthy $6.5 billion new equity inflow in October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Significance:&lt;/em&gt; There are a multitude of reasons that the FDI into India has declined. First, there has been a significant slowdown in new reforms during the Modi government’s second term, as indicated by our own “India Reforms Scorecard.” Second, too few state governments are aggressively pursuing foreign investment. Third, regulatory shifts occur quite often. Finally, dozens of sectors still have foreign investment restrictions including both sectoral FDI caps as well as stringent operational regulations that only apply to foreign companies. U.S.-India cooperation on boosting Indian manufacturing will be mutually advantageous. For instance, my colleague Raymond Vickery, notes that the signing of the U.S.-India Memorandum of Understanding on Semiconductor Supply Chain and Innovation will allow the two countries to the identify complementary competencies, and prevent unrequited competition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coming year is replete with promises and pitfalls. National elections in both India and the United States could trigger shifts in foreign policy and economic policymaking. New revelations related to the attempted murder case in New York may provide new fuel to the relationship’s critics. Additionally, the United States’ and India’s differing approaches to the elections in Bangladesh will underscore geostrategic divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we can expect the several workstreams outlined above to bear fruit. Senior-level engagements provide action-forcing events — with great urgency over time as China increases its dangerous activities across the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the words of the author Karl Schroeder, “Foresight is not about predicting the future, it’s about minimizing surprise”. We may not know every significant in 2024 that will influence the relationship, but the high level of dialogue between the United States and Indian governments is reason for cautious optimism.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方開案陳詞：黎智英為「主腦」 國安法生效前已著手聯絡及會面外國官員&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;控方指黎智英與李柱銘晤佩洛西 多次受訪稱需要外國向中國施壓制裁&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/epA4qge.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（2日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第4日審訊。3名《國安法》指定法官上月裁定煽動刊物罪無逾時檢控後，黎今早庭上答辯，否認3項控罪。之後控方讀出開案陳詞，指黎智英是本案「主腦」，對《蘋果日報》的運作有完全的控制權，他曾指示下屬開設英文版，以圖尋求外國制裁中國及香港特區官員。控方又指黎在《國安法》生效之前，已開始與不同的外國官員及非政府組織人士聯絡、會面，尋求實施制裁、封鎖及敵對行動，至今共有42名中國及香港特區官員被制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;76歲的黎智英身穿白色恤衫、藍色西裝褸，由數名懲教人員帶往被告欄應訊，他面帶笑容、神情愉悅地與妻子及兒女打招呼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/w1uTRNc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認一項發布煽動刊物及兩項串謀勾結外國勢力罪-另一項勾結外力罪則存檔法庭&quot;&gt;黎否認一項發布煽動刊物及兩項串謀勾結外國勢力罪 另一項勾結外力罪則存檔法庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在上月開審首天，辯方爭議串謀煽動刊物罪逾時檢控，3名《國安法》指定法官聽畢控辯雙方陳詞後，裁定法庭在檢控期限屆滿10日之前收到控方通知擬加控罪，所以認為不存在逾時檢控的情況，因此駁回辯方申請，換言之控方就煽動刊物罪的檢控仍然有效。今天辯方向法庭申請釐清相關裁決，指稱控罪時段應縮短至10日，即2021年6月14至24日，惟3名法官認為辯方是提出新理據並意圖重啟爭議，最終拒絕申請。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;接著4名被告在庭上答辯。黎智英否認一項「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物罪」及一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪。蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司派出一名代表，該人士代表3間公司同樣否認上述兩罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦否認另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪。他另面對的一項「勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，控方則申請存檔於法庭，獲法庭批准。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方形容黎為激進的政治人物-是案中主腦&quot;&gt;控方形容黎為「激進的政治人物」 是案中主腦&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作開案陳詞，指本案關於一名「激進的政治人物」，激起市民對中央及特區政府的憎恨，以及勾結外國勢力以對中國及香港特區實施制裁、封鎖及敵對行動，危害國家安全。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英是3項控罪的主腦，並與政治倡議團體「Stand with Hong Kong, Fight for Freedom」一同串謀犯案。在案發時期，《蘋果日報》一共發布了161篇具煽動性文章，其中31篇在2020年7月1日《國安法》實施之後發布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指稱，早在《國安法》於2020年7月生效之前，黎智英已開始支持或提出請求外國勢力向中央及特區政府實施制裁或封鎖。據《蘋果日報》報導，黎智英於2019年7月與時任美國副總統彭斯、時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧及美國參議員等人會面，討論《逃犯條例》修訂，當黎被問到美國可以做什麼時，黎曾提出制裁中國及香港官員，讓他們知道有何後果。控方指，上述顯示《蘋果日報》被利用作為平台提倡制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黎智英與多名外籍人士聯絡-導致42名中港官員受制裁&quot;&gt;控方指黎智英與多名外籍人士聯絡 導致42名中港官員受制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，從2020年7月1日《國安法》實施起，至2021年2月15日陳梓華被拘捕，黎與 Mark Simon 和陳梓華等人一同串謀勾結外國勢力。控方在庭上屏幕展示人物關係圖，其中 Mark Simon 是黎智英的私人助理，二人均在 WhatsApp 群組「DC Dems」及 Signal 群組「Jimmy Mark」。其他涉案人士包括前美國陸軍上將 Jack Keane、前美國國防部副部長 Paul Wolfowitz、前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚（James Cunningham）、「香港監察」創辦人 Benedict Rogers 及「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」行政總監 Luke de Pulford 等，控方指部份人加入上述兩個通訊群組，亦會與黎智英「一對一」聯絡及電郵。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，事實上不同的制裁措施的確有實施，至今共有42名中國及香港特區官員被制裁，審訊期間將會傳召香港城市大學法律學院教授王貴國就此作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指擬傳召4名前蘋果高層出庭作供-其中3名為同案被告&quot;&gt;控方指擬傳召4名前蘋果高層出庭作供 其中3名為同案被告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就煽動刊物和涉及蘋果高層的串謀勾結外國勢力罪，控方將會依賴同案被告張劍虹、陳沛敏、楊清奇，以及未被起訴的前營運總監兼行政總裁周達權的證供，以證明串謀犯罪協議的存在，以及相關串謀協議乃源自黎智英的指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方邀請法庭考慮相關串謀是持續性的，亦邀請法庭考慮黎智英在2020年5月開設了個人 Twitter 帳戶，作為顯示意圖的「外顯行為（Overt act）」。此外，控方依賴22篇黎智英個人專欄「成敗樂一笑」的評論文章、一段訪問影片，以及24段網上直播節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」影片，題為「Live Q&amp;amp;A with Jimmy Lai」。控方亦會依賴黎智英接受外國傳媒訪問及 Twitter 帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎智英指示開設英文版-以圖尋求外力制裁&quot;&gt;控方：黎智英指示開設英文版 以圖尋求外力制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，《蘋果日報》於1995年1月根據《本地報刊註冊條例》註冊，直至2021年6月24日停運之前，《蘋果日報》一直是香港廣泛流通的報紙，無論實體報紙還是網站均有影響力。《蘋果》亦開設社交媒體包括 Facebook、Twitter 和 YouTube 。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月25日，黎智英指示《蘋果》開設英文版，以圖尋求外力向中央及香港政府實施制裁，並發布了一篇文章題為「打國際線 蘋果英文版免費試睇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方提及社長與總編輯等各人角色-黎智英對蘋果運作有完全控制權&quot;&gt;控方提及社長與總編輯等各人角色 黎智英對《蘋果》運作有「完全控制權」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就各人在案中角色，控方指黎智英為串謀犯罪的主腦，對《蘋果日報》的運作有完全的控制權，他會向編輯發出指示以執行日常運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹於案發時為《蘋果日報》社長，負責公司的整體運作，以及報紙的出版及發行。陳沛敏則是副社長，是實體報紙日常運作的決策人，亦撰寫評論文章，刊於專欄「堆填生活」。羅偉光是《蘋果日報》的總編輯，負責編輯工作及擔任《蘋果》網上平台的決策人。而林文宗是執行總編輯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Lsv49xQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馮偉光是英文版網站的編輯，並會以筆名「盧峯」撰寫評論文章。楊清奇是《蘋果日報》的主筆，負責撰寫社論，以及尋找適合的時評作者供稿。楊自己亦以筆名「李平」撰寫評論文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英作為「飯盒會」的主席，平日會與陳沛敏、張劍虹、羅偉光、林文宗及楊清奇一同討論《蘋果日報》及其網上平台的編採方向。黎亦撰寫評論文章，刊於其專欄「成敗樂一笑」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指simon-lee於海外管理黎的twitter帳戶&quot;&gt;控方指Simon Lee於海外管理黎的Twitter帳戶&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於利世民（Simon Lee）則負責管理黎智英的Twitter 帳戶，黎的帳戶於2020年5月發布首則帖文，但《國安法》生效後，利已經停止管理黎的帳戶，直至他離港後再次恢復相關工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周達權案發時則為《蘋果日報》的營運總監，亦是壹傳媒管理服務有限公司的財務總裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李運騰和李素蘭審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎的律師團隊包括資深大律師彭耀鴻和大律師 Marc Corlett、關文渭、黃雅斌、董皓哲及李峰琦。3間蘋果日報公司清盤人由大律師王國豪代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方由副刑事檢控專員周天行、署理助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤、高級檢控官吳加悅及陳穎琛等代表。警方國安處總警司李桂華則坐在律政司團隊後排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同案8名被告：前行政總裁張劍虹、前總編輯羅偉光、前副社長陳沛敏、前執行總編輯林文宗、前英文主筆馮偉光、前主筆楊清奇、李宇軒和陳梓華，早前已承認「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，現正還柙，等待黎智英審訊完畢後判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（2日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第4日審訊。控方早上開始作開案陳詞，指黎智英掌控《蘋果日報》的運作，為案中主腦，並且在《國安法》實施之前便著手聯絡外國官員。下午控方在庭上展示時任美國眾議院議長佩洛西 Twitter 截圖，顯示黎於2019年10月曾聯同民主黨創黨主席李柱銘一同見面。庭上播放多段黎智英接受採訪的片段，他提及香港反修例是「最後一戰」，非常需要「外國勢力」的支持，以改變中國乃至世界，又促請美國向中國實施制裁，「我相信特朗普是一個守信用的人」。控方亦展示黎與蘋果副社長陳沛敏的對話，二人曾討論制裁名單，並提及「賣港賊」字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方籲法庭考慮社會騷亂背景-蘋果頭版籲上街&quot;&gt;控方籲法庭考慮社會騷亂背景 蘋果頭版籲上街&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方邀請法庭採取司法認知（judicial notice），自2019年6月反修例運動開始，本港處於社會動亂及暴力事件頻繁發生的時期。在這段期間，《蘋果日報》刊登了題為《黎智英：倘修例傳媒冇得做》的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而在政府宣布暫緩修訂後，報紙頭版題為「惡法擬暫緩但不撤、遊行前夕、林鄭緩兵、明天照上街」。同年7月1日更有示威者闖入立法會大樓。政府其後於2019年9月4日宣布撤回修訂條例草案，報紙頭版則以「Freedom Summer」作為英語標題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方庭上播片-稱黎智英多次與外國官員會面接受外媒訪問-談及制裁&quot;&gt;控方庭上播片 稱黎智英多次與外國官員會面、接受外媒訪問 談及制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，在《國安法》實施前，黎智英已多次與外國官員會談、接受外國媒體訪問以及在美國報紙撰寫文章。控方展示黎與美國、英國及台灣連繫的時間表，時間由2016年開始至2020年。控方亦在庭上播放8段黎智英與外國官員會談、接受外國或台灣媒體訪問的片段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著簡述黎智英與外國官員等人的關係。於2019年7月9日，《蘋果》刊登文章《蓬佩奧晤黎智英》。同月，黎會見美國國家安全顧問博爾頓。黎其後在何俊仁主持的網台節目《細說中南海》擔任嘉賓。《蘋果》網站報導黎在節目中的言論，包括：「黑社會文化就是要讓人恐懼、用暴力打低對方，跟共產黨如出一轍」，又指控中央政府管治下的社會是「恐懼社會」而不是「自由社會」。對於721白衣人襲擊事件，黎亦表示：「今次恐襲必須交由國際機構如聯合國或英美等國家，作公開的獨立調查。」他其後稱：「反送中行動發展至今，越來越需要國際支持」，報導提及「（黎）早前與美國國務卿會面時，對方問他：『美國可以怎樣做？』」，黎認為美國可以實施制裁，令中國官員可以知道後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，當美國在2019年8月開始提出《香港人權及民主法案》時，黎智英與香港民主委員會一同呼籲美國支持，並對香港及中國政府實施制裁。控方庭上展示時任美國眾議院議長佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi）的 Twitter 截圖，顯示2019年10月與黎智英和民主黨創黨主席李柱銘等人會面。影片顯示同年10月25日，黎與李柱銘出席時任美國副總統彭斯的專題演講，黎發言指，以人道方式解決香港問題是貿易戰的重要考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;庭上展示黎智英與陳沛敏對話截圖-討論賣港賊制裁名單&quot;&gt;庭上展示黎智英與陳沛敏對話截圖 討論「賣港賊」制裁名單&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於2019年10月及2020年3月，黎指示員工取消公司的「飯盒會」，因他需要出席由 Mark Simon 所安排的美國參議員會面。控方亦展示雙方合照。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月，《壹傳媒》前副社長陳沛敏告知黎智英，政府或會提出《國安法》。黎及後於 Twitter 發文，附有一張政協委員手持「支持國安立法 護航一國兩制」橫額的圖片，並在帖文寫道：「美國政府是否應該將他們納入制裁名單？」，同時標籤「#MagnitskyAct （馬格尼茨基法）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方庭上展示黎智英與蘋果副社長陳沛敏之間的 WhatsApp 對話內容，當中顯示二人討論制裁名單，提及「賣港賊」字眼。黎智英又向陳提及，希望警察為他們所犯的罪行付上代價。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示黎智英與楊清奇之間的通訊對話內容，顯示楊向黎報告再有多兩名作者可供稿給《蘋果日報》英文版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎形容香港在新冷戰前線-籲美國以行動支持-包括派人來港&quot;&gt;黎形容香港在「新冷戰」前線 籲美國以行動支持 包括派人來港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指2019年7月，黎智英與時任美國副總統彭斯及其他資深參議員會面。控方又展示 WhatsApp 對話截圖，顯示同年3月李柱銘和陳方安生與彭斯見面後，黎向李表示現在似乎是在美國華盛頓游說的好時機，因現時氣氛「反中」和支持抗爭，美國兩黨對中國的敵對行動是顯而易見的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，黎智英於2019年7月曾與「保衛民主基金會」的資深副主席 Johnathan Schanzer 進行現場對談。黎強調反修例是「最後一戰」，而香港人的反抗是道德力量的戰爭，又指美國政府是道德權威，其支持是有力量的武器，因此香港極需要美國支持，否則香港缺乏持續反抗的能力。黎形容「新冷戰」是關乎價值的鬥爭，而香港正在「前線」，他最後指，美國不能只說不做，同時亦要以行動支持香港人，包括派人員來港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指有效方法是凍結中國官員戶口&quot;&gt;黎指有效方法是凍結中國官員戶口&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎智英與 Mark Simon 之間的對話截圖，2019年7月 Mark Simon 轉述時任美國國務院高級顧問 Mary Kissel 的要求，指屆時黎與副總統彭斯會面時，可提出建議美國可就香港局勢採取什麼行動，包括制裁的時機及對象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英另在 Signal 中向 Mark Simon 指，經深思熟慮後認為美國應該取消香港特殊地位，因為若美國與中國脫鉤，當香港這個唯一出路都關上後，便會逼使中國滿足美國的要求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英亦於2020年3月至7月與 Mark Simon 以電郵通訊，並提及最有效的方法是凍結中國官員的戶口，他們就會感到害怕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎於台灣節目稱外國支持是我們唯一能夠撐下去&quot;&gt;黎於台灣節目稱：外國支持是我們唯一能夠撐下去&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎於2020年4月接受英國《金融時報》（Financial Times）訪問，談及唯一能阻止中國及拯救香港的就是國際力量。另於同年5月，黎接受台灣 YouTube 頻道《Yahoo TV 一起看》的節目「鄉民來衝康」訪問，他表示：「我很想美國影響我們⋯⋯我很想英國影響我們⋯⋯我很想外國影響我們⋯⋯他們的支持是我們唯一能夠撐下去的⋯⋯外國的勢力是現在我們非常需要⋯⋯讓我們撐下去的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎多次接受英美媒體訪問-表示相信特朗普守信用會制裁中國&quot;&gt;黎多次接受英美媒體訪問 表示：相信特朗普守信用、會制裁中國&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於2020年5月，黎智英接受美國媒體《福斯財經》（Fox Business）訪問，他其後在 Twitter 轉載有關片段。他在訪問中提到：「是時候改變中國，這樣才能改變世界⋯⋯除非中國改變，否則我們不會有和平。」他亦指美國可採用很多途徑逼使中國改變，包括凍結中國的戶口及其於美國的金錢，同時停止出口科技及電子產品到中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同月，黎接受美國《彭博》（Bloomberg）訪問，他建議美國總統特朗普向中國實施制裁，並引述特朗普稱若北京確實在香港實行《國安法》並摧毀法律，他會認真採取行動。黎接着指：「我相信特朗普是一個守信用的人，因此希望他會向中國實施制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦接受《BBC》訪問，再次促請特朗普對中國實施制裁，並解釋一旦《國安法》實施，將會是香港的「末日」，因未能保護在港商人，而香港亦不再是國際金融中心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎籲撤銷中港官員子女在外地的學生簽證&quot;&gt;黎籲撤銷中港官員子女在外地的學生簽證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於2020年5月，黎撰寫文章表示：「我的 Twitter 帖文是否真的威脅到中國的國家安全？」他在文中呼籲，撤銷中國及香港政府官員子女在外地的學生簽證。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦接受美國節目《Uncommon Knowledge with Peter Robinson》的訪問，他指需要美國協助制裁中國，而本港的特別貿易待遇不應被撤銷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎表示若實施制裁-有機會即使立國安法也不會執行&quot;&gt;黎表示若實施制裁 有機會即使立《國安法》也不會執行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2020年6月，黎智英接受《RFA 自由亞洲粵語》的訪問，他表示：「點都要抗爭，希望我哋有機會係美國、甚至歐洲其他國家支持下，我哋能夠保住法治同自由。」他又指：「而家中國處境唔係我哋覺得咁穩定⋯⋯李克強同習近平已經反晒面，你就知道佢哋下面嘅權鬥去到乜嘢地步」、「好緊要係外國盡量畀中國嘅壓力、制裁⋯⋯將中國專橫嘅做法阻擋住」。他認為外國若實施制裁，「有機會《國安法》就算立咗都唔會執行，或者執行都會將佢 water down（沖淡），唔會做到咁辣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎撰文指引渡惡法令大陸法律凌駕香港司法-並籲人參與遊行&quot;&gt;黎撰文指引渡惡法令大陸法律凌駕香港司法 並籲人參與遊行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黎撰寫的文章方面，他在其專欄「成敗樂一笑」發表題為「請站出來保住最後防線」的文章，內容包括：「『引渡惡法』的作用，就像恐怖分子襲擊產生『可用性級聯』的效果，讓香港市民都被籠罩在恐慌的順民意識下，讓大陸無法無天的法律凌駕香港的司法制度。」他有提到：「修訂《逃犯條例》就是要摧毀『一國兩制』這個習帝的眼中釘⋯⋯『引渡惡法』就是讓中央的魔爪撕破《基本法》和一國兩制的最後防線。」他於文末呼籲：「請你們相信群眾的力量，加入今天反惡法的示威遊行吧！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一文章題為《諗移民定諗遊行》，內文指：『「逃犯條例」還可以隨時拉你鎖你，多神奇的權力，多神聖的地圖啊！」、「若我們人多勢眾站出來遊行⋯⋯」及「我們會去到盡，堅決抗爭到底的事實」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎另在文章《為自己和下一代 阻擋香港沉淪》表示：「你要跟中共講法律，你從火星來的嗎？」、「修訂逃犯條例就是奪去香港的法治，拿住大陸那套陽光司法在港任拉任鎖肆虐橫行」、「香港無形中成為了集中營」、「若我們今天還有機會行出來發聲，卻袖手旁觀」。他最後呼籲：「請看前一步，六月九號花三小時，為自己和下一代留下阻擋公義沉淪的足跡。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎要求將陳方安生與美國副總統彭斯會面的消息散播&quot;&gt;黎要求將陳方安生與美國副總統彭斯會面的消息散播&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，黎於2019年3月通知《蘋果日報》的社長張劍虹，要求將陳方安生與副總統彭斯會面的消息散播開去，於是翌日的報紙以《彭斯晤陳太 關注港人權 學者：高規格接待向京施壓》為頭版標題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同年4月，黎指示副社長陳沛敏訪問「銅鑼灣書店」前店長林榮基，翌日的報紙題為《送中例殺埋身 林榮基流亡台灣 臨別呼籲 守護香港明日上街》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方開案陳詞未完，案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英否認一項「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物罪」及一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪。蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司派出一名代表，該人士代表3間公司同樣否認上述兩罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦否認另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪。他另面對的一項「勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，控方則申請存檔於法庭，獲法庭批准。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，於2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀，請求外國或者境外機構、組織、人員實施對香港特別行政區或者中華人民共和國進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，指黎智英於2020年7月1日至今年2月15日間，與 Mark Simon、陳梓華、李宇軒、劉祖廸及其他人串謀，請求外國或境外機構、組織、人員，實施對中國或香港進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司於2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及/或複製煽動刊物，具意圖：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a) 引起憎恨或藐視中央或香港特別行政區政府或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b) 激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變其他在香港的依法制定的事項&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;c) 引起對香港司法的憎恨、藐視或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is one fact that sums up the gap between the promises that Kyiv’s European partners have made to Ukraine and the reality. In March 2023, the EU made the historic decision to deliver a million artillery shells to Ukraine within 12 months. But the number that has actually been sent is closer to 300,000. For all the rhetorical commitments to support Ukraine’s defence against Russia’s invasion “for as long as it takes”, Europe has largely failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price of this complacency is already being paid in Ukrainian blood. According to the armed forces of Ukraine, over the summer of 2023, Ukraine was firing up to 7,000 artillery shells a day and managed to degrade Russia’s logistics and artillery to the point where Russia was firing about 5,000 rounds a day. Today, the Ukrainians are struggling to fire 2,000 rounds daily, while Russian artillery is reaching about 10,000. Artillery isn’t everything, but the disparity speaks to Ukraine’s relative shortage of materiel, evident in other areas such as the number of drones it can field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is likely to be able to fire about 5m rounds at Ukraine in 2024, based on its mobilised defence production, supply from Iran and North Korea, and remaining stocks. Despite the flippant observation – often made by European officials – that Russia’s economy is the same size as that of Italy, the Kremlin is producing more shells than all of Nato. Meanwhile, Ukraine is unlikely to see any significant increase in supply for some months. This will cede the initiative to the Russians. The Kremlin believes it can win by 2026, and so Putin is in no mood to negotiate or back down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not have to be like this. Earlier this month, the Estonian Ministry of Defence published a white paper detailing the levels of military equipment required to make Ukraine’s defence sustainable and for it to pursue the liberation of the occupied territories by 2025. The Estonians costed the requirements, showing they were well within the bounds of possibility. The issue is not money, but competence in delivery. If the steps to implement these measures are not taken, Ukraine will lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring Russia’s defeat in Ukraine is feasible, but it requires some important steps. First, Ukraine will need a steady supply of weapons to be able to blunt Russian attacks over the first half of 2024. This will require plenty of US support, but also increasing supply from European Nato members, whose backing will be critical as the US election looms in November. Many of the munitions provided since the beginning of the war were purchased from the international market or drawn from stockpiles, and investment in European production has been slow. But as stocks run out, sustaining Ukraine’s war effort depends critically on increasing Europe’s manufacturing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, it is essential that Ukraine corrects the mistakes that led to its failed counteroffensive in 2023. Improving the training of its troops must be the top priority. During the second world war, British forces considered 22 weeks of infantry training the minimum before a soldier was ready to join a unit, where they would then carry out collective training as part of a battalion. Ukrainian troops are lucky to get five weeks of training, while collective training is rarely carried out above the scale of the company. European Nato must expand and extend the training support provided in order to give Ukrainian units a wider tactical repertoire, and more importantly expand the scale at which the army can command and synchronise operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persistent inflation and economic shocks, like the disruption to global shipping from Houthi missile attacks in the Bab al-Mandab, mean that among European countries, making a long-term economic commitment to Ukraine will be a domestic political challenge. But that is to ignore its potential upsides. Investment in defence production, rather than relying on purchases from abroad, comes with significant levels of domestic industrial investment and with the potential for expenditure to be recovered through increased tax receipts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are good security reasons to invest in domestic production, too. A failure to do so now could leave European leaders needing to deter a fully mobilised Russia without stockpiles or the capacity to replenish them. Meanwhile, a simultaneous escalation in the Indo-Pacific in 2025 could cause the US to shift a range of critical military capabilities – aerial refuelling, logistics, air defences – to deter China, leaving Europe significantly exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ukraine, the immediate future is one of several months of hard fighting without critical resources, while endeavouring to regenerate the combat power that was expended over 2023. But Europe can determine what the second half of 2024 and indeed 2025 will look like. This is a war that can be won. The recent successful strike on the Russian landing ship Novocherkassk in harbour, protected by layers of Russian defences, shows how Ukraine can make effective use of the equipment that it is supplied with. But European security must not be squandered by more complacency.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;官裁煽動刊物罪非逾時檢控 去信法庭「提出告發」未等黎智英上庭 已屬啟動程序&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MU9Mlh9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（22日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第3日審訊。就辯方所提出的串謀煽動刊物罪逾時檢控爭議，3名《國安法》指定法官作出裁決，指法庭在檢控期限屆滿10日之前收到控方通知擬加控罪，所以認為不存在逾時檢控的情況，因此駁回辯方申請，換言之控方就煽動刊物罪的檢控仍然有效。案件押後至明年1月2日續審，屆時黎將庭上答辯，之後控方將讀出開案陳詞。押後期間黎繼續還柙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;76歲的黎智英由3名懲教人員帶往被告欄應訊，近日氣溫降至只有10度或以下，黎亦穿上深藍色厚褸，並戴上灰色頸巾。他透過耳機聽取判決時表現平靜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英稱煽動刊物控罪逾時檢控期限應由串謀首天起計帶上法庭加控才算啟動檢控&quot;&gt;黎智英稱煽動刊物控罪逾時檢控：期限應由串謀首天起計、帶上法庭加控才算啟動檢控&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英尚未正式就各項控罪答辯，在審訊首天，控辯雙方先處理法律爭議。黎的法律代表、資深大律師彭耀鴻指「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪逾時檢控，法庭無權處理。3名《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李運騰及李素蘭頒下書面裁決，駁回辯方申請。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;據判詞，黎智英在2021年12月13日被控3項罪名，包括兩項《國安法》控罪及一項串謀妨礙司法公正罪。控方在同日去信西九法院，表示有意申請新增「煽動刊物」控罪，而西九法院裁判官翌日收悉信件及相關文件，副本亦送達黎的法律代表。至12月28日的提訊日，控方申請加控，而黎的代表律師並未有提出反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指檢控期限應由串謀犯罪首日起計算6個月，即2019年10月1日便屆滿；即使辯方接受檢控期限由串謀犯罪的最後一天起計6個月，控方也需要在2021年12月24日或之前提出檢控，可是黎智英在12月28日才被帶上法庭加控，超出了期限4日。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方則稱「串謀」屬持續的罪行，被告在2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日《蘋果日報》結束營運期間，持續發布逾160篇煽動刊物，可視為同一犯罪計劃，檢控期限應由「串謀」結束當天、而非被告首次犯法起計。此外，控方稱他們於2021年12月13日向法庭表示有意加控，已屬「開始」檢控，故控方檢控並無逾時。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;判決檢控期限應由最後一日起計算&quot;&gt;判決：檢控期限應由最後一日起計算&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判決指，不接受辯方稱檢控期限由首天串謀起計，因為控方現時指控黎不只一次串謀犯罪，與一次性的串謀罪行並不相同，所以被告完成首天串謀犯罪之後，串謀協議仍然存在（still be very much alive），直至串謀完結當天，控罪並不會「過時」（stale）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判決指，只要控方有足夠證據證明有一個串謀協議貫穿整個控罪時段，那麼檢控期限便應由串謀的最後一天才開始計算，不會對被告帶來不公。就本案而言，法官裁定檢控期限應由2021年6月24日起計6個月，因此於2021年12月24日才屆滿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官條文引入提出檢控是為統一字眼-原意非改變條文內容&quot;&gt;官：條文引入「提出」檢控是為統一字眼 原意非改變條文內容&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《刑事罪行》條例第11(1)條規定，煽動控罪的檢控，「只可於犯罪後6個月內開始進行。」第11(2)條亦規定，未經律政司司長書面同意，不得就煽動控罪提出檢控。沒有爭議條文目的是要確保相關檢控及時，而不會起訴「過時」的罪行。上述兩項條文首次寫進煽動罪條例以及生效是1938年9月2日。至1972年12月31日，煽動罪條例合併入《刑事罪行條例》，經修訂後成為第11(1)及(2)條，而「提出檢控」中的「提出（instituted）」此時首次出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判決指，從上述過程可以推論，立法機關之所以在《刑事罪行條例》中引入「提出（instituted）」一詞，原意是對於所有需要首席檢察官（Attorney General）同意而檢控的罪行統一用字，而不是有意改變條文內容。直至1997年香港主權移交，條文中的「首席檢察官」修訂為「律政司司長」，除此之外便沒有任何其他修訂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官當控方提出告發檢控程序便算開始&quot;&gt;官：當控方「提出告發」檢控程序便算開始&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判決指，沒有爭議「煽動罪」是可公訴的罪行（indictable offence），受《裁判官條例》第三部管轄，考慮《裁判官條例》第8及27條有關「申訴」或「告發」的字眼，法官認為不論在公訴程序或簡易程序中，當控方「提出告發（laying of an information）」，檢控程序便算是開始，而毋須等到被告人出庭應訊或帶上法庭才算開始。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《裁判官條例》第2條的定義，「告發（information）」意思包括「控告」。而第75(1)條規定「任何指稱有人犯了可公訴罪行的申訴或告發，均須以書面提出，並須載有或包含有指稱已犯罪行的陳述，以及為提供有關該項罪行性質的合理資料的所需詳情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就本案而言，法官認為西九法院裁判官在2021年12月14日收妥控方的信件、控罪詳情及相關文件後，毫無疑問地已充份地構成「提出告發」，符合第75(1)條的要求。而控方一旦提出了告發，便毋須做額外功夫，檢控程序已算是啟動。（“The information once so laid, no more was required of the prosecutor and the prosecution had ‘begun’.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當控方提出告發後，裁判官可以發出拘捕令把被告人帶上法庭，或簽發傳票要求被告人自行到庭應訊，不論是哪一種的上庭方式，它們只是為了被告能被帶到裁判官席前的程序，是法庭的事務，與控方無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判決指，雖然《刑事罪行條例》第11(1)及(2)條分別使用「開始（begun）」及「提出（instituted）」，字眼不同，但是兩者均指向相同的東西。判決又提到，兩項條文目的是保障被告人，若果立法機關有意賦予兩詞不同意思，理應提供兩詞各自的釋義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;倘被告留院或不在港-致未能及時檢控-法官不接受辯方稱不應受審&quot;&gt;倘被告留院或不在港 致未能及時檢控 法官不接受辯方稱不應受審&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判決又指，辯方堅稱只有當被告人上庭應訊及面對控罪時，檢控程序才算啟動，會導致令人驚訝（surprising）的結果。法官曾在庭上問及，若然被告人留院、不在香港或潛逃，以致未能趕及在檢控期限之內上庭應訊呢？辯方則回答在如此情況下，被告人便不應就控罪受審，因他未能在檢控期限屆滿之前上庭。法官表示不接受辯方說法，因這不是立法原意。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 黎智英&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判決指，第11(1)及(2)條處理檢控程序的不同範疇，第11(2)條從控方角度出發，即提出告發者，並聚焦檢控須經律政司司長同意，以免濫用程序；第11(1)條則從法庭作為接收告發者的角度出發，以確保控方乃及時檢控。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;總括而言，法官認為西九法庭於2021年12月14日，即檢控期限10日之前，已收妥控方通知及有關煽動控罪的資料，故此檢控並沒有超出期限，遂駁回辯方的申請。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告為：黎智英（76歲）、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李運騰和李素蘭審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia, as a country which borders Russia and has ambitions to join the EU, is in a difficult geopolitical situation. The raft of sanctions that the EU and allies have imposed on Russia therefore raises serious questions for Tbilisi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an EU candidate country, Georgia is expected to align with the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), which includes the numerous restrictive measures imposed on Russia. However, with 20% of its territory – Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali region or South Ossetia – under Russian occupation, Georgia faces the challenge of striking a balance. On the one hand, it has sympathy and solidarity with Ukraine given the Russian occupation. On the other, it wants to avoid actions that lead to further Russian aggression against Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2023, the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at RUSI, in collaboration with the Regional Institute of Security Studies (RISS), hosted a series of roundtable discussions in Tbilisi with Georgian authorities and representatives from the private sector and civil society. The aim of these discussions was to obtain insights into Georgia’s position on the international sanctions against Russia and the current Georgian efforts, within their national jurisdiction, to prevent circumvention and evasion. This engagement is part of the European Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet), supported by the National Endowment for Democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;georgias-approach-to-financial-sanctions-against-russia&quot;&gt;Georgia’s Approach to Financial Sanctions Against Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 25 February 2022, the government of Georgia announced its decision not to implement international sanctions against Russia. However, in reality, Tbilisi’s approach to sanctions is far more complex. Alignment with the EU’s CFSP is important for Georgia’s EU candidacy status and the country’s connections to global markets and correspondent banking relations effectively mandate compliance with these restrictions. Under these conditions, without the introduction of any new laws in Georgia, the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) instructed the country’s financial sector to comply with the sanctions imposed by the US, the EU and the UK. To support compliance in the sector, the NBG has a dedicated anti-money laundering (AML) department that is liaising with banks on sanctions and conducts inspections in relation to sanctions against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from the NBG highlighted that businesses in Georgia have boosted their resources dedicated to sanctions and are increasingly adopting programmes to check and identify sanctions issues. The NBG representative noted that they are aware of the complex rules and licences related to the monitoring of goods and services under restrictions, as well the cost of compliance for the private sector. Although businesses seek support from the NBG, Georgia’s central bank faces the challenge of responding to questions about foreign sanctions regimes over which it has no control, and no insight beyond what is on the relevant sanctions coalition websites. For this reason, the NBG intends to guide the private sector in the right direction but informs financial institutions that they must assess their own risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from Georgia’s Banking Association expressed its satisfaction with the performance of the banking sector on sanctions, due to the effectiveness of AML and sanctions procedures that the industry has in place. However, the participant noted that several banks operating in Georgia are part of regional banking groups in countries that are not implementing sanctions, such as Turkey, Kazakhstan or Azerbaijan. This creates risk. The Banking Association representative added that the services of VISA and Mastercard credit cards of Russian banks in Georgia had been suspended to comply with international sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from the Bank of Georgia (BOG) also described its limited risk appetite for customers from Russia and transactions related to the country – these are now subject to enhanced due diligence procedures. The BOG, one of the main banks in Georgia with 2.5 million customers, is listed on the London Stock Exchange, so it is under the supervision of the UK Financial Conduct Authority and therefore is required to comply with UK (and wider international) sanctions against Russia. The BOG currently has two co-directors – one for general financial crime issues and another oversees the sanctions programmes – in its compliance department, as well as 80 employees in the “second line of defence”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this background, the number of suspicious transaction reports in Georgia has increased. Participants explained that the financial sector has expanded its criteria of high-risk activities to include: international transactions; transactions in US dollars; high-net-worth individuals; and jurisdictions under suspicion of facilitating sanctions evasion, among others. Georgia has taken significant steps to mitigate risks of breaching international sanctions, for example, the Tbilisi City Hall terminated the almost $50 million-contract for 44 subway cars for the Tbilisi Metro, that was agreed with the EU-sanctioned Russian company Metrovagonmash. However, private sector representatives noted that while businesses will not trade with a company that raises clear red flags, the emerging challenge is around companies that pose “yellow flags”. To ensure compliance in Georgia, correspondent banks now ask Georgian banks about their transaction monitoring systems, their automated alerts systems, the percentage of false alerts generated, the number of transactions rejected, and the resources allocated to effectively check these procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;when-sanctions-come-home-the-case-of-otar-partskhaladze&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;When Sanctions Come Home: The Case of Otar Partskhaladze&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As many participants in the workshops noted, the topic of Russia sanctions is highly politicised. Nothing illustrates this more than the case of Georgian citizen, businessman and former prosecutor Otar Partskhaladze, who was sanctioned by the US in September 2023.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Partskhaladze and two companies of which he owned a majority were sanctioned for allegedly facilitating malign Russian influence in Georgia led by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), and personally profiting from his FSB connection&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In June 2023, in line with a change in the law that had been criticised by the IMF and other experts as damaging the NBG’s independence, a new governor was appointed. Following the designation of Partskhaladze, the newly appointed governor, Natia Turnava, issued an executive order that required a local court order before the assets of a Georgian national could be frozen under international sanctions. This overturned the NBG’s previous position that banks should implement Russia sanctions.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Among other implications of this decision, the IMF suspended its programme for Georgia over its concerns for the independence of the central bank.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Georgia’s financial sector has, in effect, complied with international sanctions, trade with Russia has continued to increase. This poses numerous challenges to tackling circumvention through Georgia. The following section looks more closely at the state of trade restrictions in Georgia and the related insights provided by participants at the workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trade-restrictions-between-georgia-and-russia&quot;&gt;Trade Restrictions Between Georgia and Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is Georgia’s third-largest trade partner, with 11.1% of Georgian exports going to Russia. Georgia has clearly stated that it will not implement trade sanctions against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Georgian authorities emphasised that Georgia is one of the main partners of the EU and the US in the region. While the combined EU market is Georgia’s main trade partner, the share is gradually decreasing. Georgian businesses understand the importance of the EU market and are motivated to increase their trade relations, but they require support from the EU to promote investment in the country to support trade decoupling from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants emphasised that the complexity of monitoring supply chains makes it futile for international partners to tackle circumvention unilaterally. Georgian authorities stressed the resources they are allocating to supporting international partners, prioritising the list of 45 high-priority items, and they find discussions on secondary sanctions frustrating. To facilitate compliance, authorities also highlighted their interest in obtaining consolidated sanctions lists from the international coalition, given the costs of monitoring all the lists independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to participating authorities, since the beginning, Georgia conveyed to international partners that it would support their aims of preventing circumvention. Authorities noted that half of their capacity is currently focused on sanctions implementation, identifying banned EU goods bound for Russia and the parties involved in their trade. They also noted that the closure of trade borders with the EU via the Baltic states has led to a notable displacement of trade transit through Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One side-effect of the introduction of international sanctions on Russia is that Georgia has become a regional re-export hub for used cars from the EU and the US. Both Brussels and Washington have demanded Georgia cease this trade with Russia. In August 2023, Georgia agreed to introduce this ban on the re-export of Western cars to Russia. However, participants at the workshop explained that this action has simply created another layer in the circumvention route. Georgia remains part of the supply chain, but cars are now first transported to Kazakhstan and are likely re-exported again to Russia, despite efforts to identify the real end-user. A further complication is the export of the spare car parts, given their dual-use nature. For their export, Customs requires official letters from manufactures on where these parts are going and how they will be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, participants highlighted the circumvention challenge Georgia faces as a trading partner with the Eurasian Economic Union, a mechanism that Russia is increasingly using to obfuscate the destination of trade flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgian authorities were concerned that the focus of sanctions discussions is dominated by financial integrity, neglecting the key role played by trade integrity, particularly when considering Georgia’s geographic location. Trade integrity requires a combination of export control capacity and trade transparency, which demands good customs communication channels between exporting and importing countries and capacity to monitor the supply chains. This system depends on the reporting information provided by the private sector, but businesses do not have the capacity to identify everything related to sanctions and thus information is incomplete. This is particularly true in the non-financial sector, which participants described as notably less experienced in sanctions implementation. Representatives from the private sector explained that while no meetings have been arranged with authorities to support sanctions implementation, a good cross-sector relationship exists whereby businesses can approach authorities to receive guidance and training when required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve its domestic controls, Georgia has received technical and capacity-building training from EU member states. The Ministry of Finance reported that as of 8 November 2023, Georgia had stopped 2,970 containers and denied 1,683 applications from companies to conduct operations related to goods and services subject to restrictions. As a small jurisdiction, the Georgian authorities see these numbers as a sign of success. However, they raised frustrations with the time it takes the EU or the US to respond to queries about trucks stopped at the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgian authorities at the roundtable also share the concern expressed by international partners regarding the involvement of Russia’s Federal Security Service (the FSB) in establishing front companies in third countries. Investigations into FSB-facilitated circumvention schemes are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flow of land-based exports from Georgia to Russia – which some participants suggested might be complicated by the development of a north–south trade corridor between Iran and Russia – continues to attract international attention. However, Georgian authorities pointed to an overlooked yet significant challenge that they face: monitoring maritime transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenges-of-maritime-trade&quot;&gt;The Challenges of Maritime Trade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monitoring land-based trade is a complex and resource-consuming effort for Georgia. Detecting banned goods transported in trucks at the border with Russia and identifying the real end-user of the products is a challenging task. Alongside this task, Georgia also has access to the Black Sea and monitoring maritime trade entering and leaving its ports presents significant challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia’s Maritime Transport Agency is monitoring vessels and their cargo to prevent the circumvention of international sanctions. Representatives from the agency described the challenge that the small six-hour vessel inspection window poses. Authorities must operate within this period, and delays in obtaining the necessary answers from the beneficial owners of vessels can be problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative of the Maritime Transport Agency explained that, between August and September 2022, several companies wanted to re-flag their vessels with the Georgian flag, but they were identified to be Russian so Georgia denied their requests. Still, a major challenge the Agency faces in this regard is the presence of vessels with flags from non-cooperative jurisdictions. Georgian authorities try to communicate with the reported beneficial owners in these jurisdictions – notably British Overseas Territories in the Caribbean – but often fail to establish contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia also faces a unique challenge on maritime trade through the ports of Russian-occupied Abkhazia. Georgia monitors trade through these ports but has no control over this activity. Georgian authorities track vessels in Abkhazia that involve suspicious beneficial owners and offshore jurisdictions and shares these reports with international partners. Authorities described how the vessels that Georgia tracks from Russia to Abkhazia go to Turkish ports to obfuscate their origin. By visiting Turkish ports, they can obtain the necessary papers to then access EU ports and thus circumvent sanctions. Georgian authorities expressed their dissatisfaction with the scarce support received from the EU and the US on this concern, a view consistent with their wider frustration on support received for implementing trade-related sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-of-russian-inflows-of-people-and-money-into-georgia&quot;&gt;Impact of Russian Inflows (of People and Money) into Georgia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final point emerged from the workshop on the unique challenge of geography and the resulting incoming flows of Russian citizens and investment. Participants noted that Georgia gets economic benefits from the increasing numbers of Russian citizens coming into the country and opening businesses. Tourism from Russian nationals has increased, and new Russian-owned businesses have opened in the country, notably in the IT industry. But participants also agreed that this presents security risks for Georgia. Real estate market prices in Georgia have doubled and participants described the IT industry as posing particular risks in terms of sanctions, given that these services are banned in the EU and US but can now operate from Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, while these booming economic sectors generate wealth in the country, participants were concerned about the negative impact their sudden departure would have on Georgia’s economy should they leave immediately the war is over. Moreover, participants added that these new businesses are competing with existing Georgian businesses, with resulting impacts on business opportunities and/or recruitment. One interesting observation related to Russian tourism is that Russian nationals are setting up tourist guides that Georgian authorities fear may be spreading pro-Russian propaganda as part of their service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is a visibly divisive topic in Georgia, which, participants assert, is fuelled by mis/disinformation. Pro-Russian media pushes a narrative on the ineffectiveness of sanctions on the Russian economy and their negative impact on the sanctioning country’s population, while opposing media focuses on the scandal, noted earlier in this report, around the former prosecutor. Georgian media also focuses on how Georgia is economically dependent on trade with Russia and the aforementioned Russian inflows. These dependencies are made more acute by the lack of EU trade growth. Participants disagreed with these views and added that economic ties with Russia are not critical to Georgia’s economic security, having survived a direct war with Russia, although participants did share their concerns over Russia’s influence on Georgia’s critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Georgian government chose not to implement sanctions against Russia and the lack of a relevant national law has provided an opportunity for it to make some questionable decisions (such as the case of Partskhaladze and the NBG). However, the insights provided by both public and private sector participants at the recent workshops reflect the solid efforts of the Georgian authorities to prevent circumvention and evasion from happening through its jurisdiction. In doing so, Georgian authorities face similar challenges to those found across EU member states. Participants agreed on the following list of recommendations to improve Georgia’s ability to support relevant elements of the international sanctions regime against Russia by tackling circumvention:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a dedicated government sanctions unit.&lt;/strong&gt; While several departments and agencies consider sanctions, Georgia’s response would benefit from greater coordination that could be achieved by establishing a national sanctions coordination unit that can draw on relevant expertise from across the public and private sectors. This unit could also highlight where new legislation is needed to ensure the integrity of EU sanctions implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote trade transparency.&lt;/strong&gt; Integrity and transparency are essential in trade. This must be supported by the quality and accessibility of data regarding beneficial ownership, as well as the availability of information-sharing channels to ensure a robust framework and facilitate investigations to enforce it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue providing international support to Georgia.&lt;/strong&gt; Georgian authorities appear committed to preventing the circumvention of international sanctions but, as in all jurisdictions implementing sanctions, the country requires substantial technical assistance support from international partners. The EU and its allies must ensure they provide sufficient and timely support to Georgia’s anti-circumvention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplify bureaucratic impediments for Georgia’s trade with the EU.&lt;/strong&gt; Georgian economic operators should see the EU as an accessible market. Entering and initiating trade with the EU should not be a complicated process. Facilitating smooth trade between the two jurisdictions will see Georgia’s trade shift from Russia towards the EU. As a share, trade with Russia is currently increasing and trade with the EU is decreasing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest in EU/US–Georgia trade relations.&lt;/strong&gt; If Georgia is expected to further decouple from Russia, the EU and the US should encourage their businesses to invest in Georgia and expand trade links with the country. Participants explained that Georgian businesses understand that Russia is not a reliable partner, but if they are to reduce trade with Russia, they need to identify a sustainable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop discussions highlighted the challenges Georgia faces from both a trade and security perspective when considering the implementation of sanctions on Russia. While there is support for sanctions across the public and private sectors, Georgia clearly needs greater support in managing the related trade and security risks. The EU and allies must show that they understand Georgia’s security predicament. Russia’s intention to hold a referendum to annex the occupied territories in Georgia – as it did in Ukraine – can be reactivated any time, creating a sense of vulnerability in Georgia. Georgia is a strategic partner for the West in the region and thus its national interests, particularly related to trade, should be taken into consideration to foster heightened commitment to the implementation of sanctions on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方指黎智英持續串謀、無逾時檢控 官周五頒判決&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eOV0D6a.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，踏入審訊第2天。黎智英一方昨爭議控方加控煽動罪屬逾時檢控，法庭無權處理，辯方今補充指，煽動罪設6個月的檢控時限是平衡公眾利益，以盡快制止煽動刊物發布，強調控方應及時檢控。控方則指，串謀屬持續的罪行，被告在案發兩年間持續發布逾160篇煽動刊物，可視為同一犯罪計劃，檢控期限應由串謀結束當天、而非被告首次犯法起計；而控方向法庭表示有意加控已屬「開始」檢控，故控方檢控並無逾時。法官聽畢陳詞後，押至本周五就法律爭議頒下裁決，料控方同日將不會讀出開案陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;身穿淺藍色恤衫、灰色西裝褸的黎智英，今步入法庭時向旁聽席微笑揮手和點頭，其妻子和兩名子女也有到庭，女兒向黎飛吻，黎亦微笑回以飛吻。有旁聽人士高呼「撐住！頂住！」，司法機構職員及保安人員立即阻止稱：「保持安靜！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方昨爭議，控方前年加控黎智英串謀刊印煽動刊物罪時，已超出煽動罪6個月的檢控時限，法庭無司法管轄權審理；亦認為就《刑事罪行條例》第11(1)條列明煽動罪檢控「只可於犯罪後6個月內開始進行」，當中「開始（begun）」一詞是立法時特意選用，只有在控方把被告帶上法庭加控才算「開始」進行檢控，而控方於2021年12月13日去信通知法庭有意加控，並不算「開始」檢控，控方仍然超出檢控時限。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方檢控時限為確保盡快制止煽動作為平衡公眾利益-無對控方不公&quot;&gt;辯方：檢控時限為確保盡快制止煽動作為、平衡公眾利益 無對控方不公&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻今重申，控方單單去信法庭「提出告發（laying any information）」並不算是「開始」檢控，解釋煽動條例立法時確保需保障基本權利，因此設有嚴格的6個月檢控時限，亦列明須律政司司長的同意才能提出檢控。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭亦認為，檢控時限無對控方造成不公，指當有人發布煽動刊物，為了公眾利益，應盡快檢控來制止刊物發布，並讓公眾知悉哪些刊物不應發布；而若控方認為煽動罪不足以反映刑責，望以串謀罪檢控，亦可於6個月的時限內進行。彭強調，控方應及時檢控，不能什麼也不做，等到數年後才因時限已過、無法以煽動罪檢控，而改用串謀罪檢控；又指檢控時限雖或令一些人逃過法網，但相關「不公」是條文所固有，立法者制定時已平衡公眾利益。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表3間《蘋果日報》相關公司的大律師王國豪，採納彭的陳詞，同意3間公司被帶上法庭加控才算「開始」檢控，並補充3間公司於2022年2月10日才被正式加控串謀發布煽動刊物罪，比黎智英遲兩個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方被告持續串謀分開檢控屬荒謬&quot;&gt;控方：被告持續串謀、分開檢控屬「荒謬」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就辯方主張檢控時限應由被告首次完成犯罪、即2019年4月1日發布首篇煽動刊物起計算，副刑事檢控專員周天行回應，串謀是持續的罪行（continuing offence），而本案串謀協議歷時多於兩年，被告並非僅在案發首天發布一篇煽動刊物，而是於2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日《蘋果日報》結束營運期間，持續發布逾160篇煽動刊物，因此檢控時限應由串謀最後一天、即6月24日起計算。而本案所涉行為性質相似、互相關聯，故可被視為同一個犯罪計劃（criminal enterprise）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周又指，即使只是發布一篇煽動刊物，但若能持續被公眾瀏覽，串謀時期亦應由刊物首次出現至其下架為止；並認為辯方稱應分開檢控每項串謀行為的說法荒謬，直言會令案件變得支離破碎（fragmented），無法反映整體罪行的嚴重性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方法庭收到提控已屬開始檢控若須親帶上庭令控罪難實行&quot;&gt;控方：法庭收到提控已屬「開始」檢控、若須親帶上庭令控罪難實行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而對辯方爭議將黎智英帶上法庭加控才算「開始」進行檢控，周天行則認為法庭收到有關控罪的告發（laying information），即控方於12月13日去信法庭指有意加控，已算是「開始」檢控，解釋《刑事罪行條例》第11(1)條中的「開始」，與《裁判官條例》第26條的「提出告發」，用字不同但意思一樣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《裁判官條例》第26條，無規定時效的罪行須於6個月內「作出申訴或提出告發」。惟法官李運騰指，《刑事罪行條例》第11(1)條正規定了煽動罪的檢控時限，因此第26條不適用；又指制訂第11(1)條時，第26條已存在，若兩項條文效果一樣，為何還有需要制訂第11(1)條？又指控方詮釋會令第11(1)條變得多餘。周天行同意兩條法例字眼不一，但認為只是字眼上的改變，實際意思是一樣；並指若須將被告帶上法庭才算「開始」檢控，會令控罪難以實行（impracticable），因被告或潛逃和無法聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;周五頒判決-料不會同日讀出開案陳詞&quot;&gt;周五頒判決 料不會同日讀出開案陳詞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭耀鴻回應時重申，《刑事罪行條例》第11(1)條比《裁判官條例》第26條較遲制訂，若「開始」檢控等同「提出告發」，則會令《刑事罪行條例》第11(1)條變得毫無用處，故兩者必然有分別。彭亦重申檢控時限應由被告首次犯罪起計。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;雙方陳詞完畢，法官杜麗冰表示需時考慮，將於周五（22日）頒下裁決，並認為不會在當天讀出開案陳詞。法官李運騰亦補充，控方開案陳詞或受裁決結果影響，不方便於當天開始讀出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英於中午1時由俗稱「鐵甲威龍」的囚車送走，警方電單車及私家車護送囚車離開，現場亦有反恐特勤隊警員持槍戒備。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;司法機構新聞主任到場了解後，向記者澄清法院並無相關「house rule」，純粹誤會，又指職員是擔心擾亂秩序，故溝通上「多咗啲」、「誤會咗」，記者可與人聊天採訪，只是不得進行拍攝。&lt;/p&gt;

Despite its current limitations, NATO is the primary actor capable of deterring and preventing hybrid attacks on its allies and has expedited its approach to CUI protection by establishing new organizations to that aim. At the 2023 NATO Vilnius summit, allies agreed to establish the Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Underwater Infrastructure within NATO’s Allied Maritime Command (MARCOM), which focuses on preparing for, deterring, and defending against the coercive use of energy and other hybrid tactics. To help NATO planners and staff at the new center conceptualize and prioritize their efforts, this issue brief provides immediate and long-term recommendations to set the new center up for success.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO is not prepared to defend its allies’ critical undersea infrastructure (CUI) from increasingly prevalent Russian hybrid tactics. The recent Balticconnector pipeline incident highlighted the risk of deliberate damage to CUI across Europe. It follows last year’s Nord Stream pipeline explosions, among other incidents, and bears the hallmarks of sabotage. Europe’s expansive and growing network of undersea infrastructure will remain vulnerable to attacks aimed at disrupting transatlantic cohesion and economic activity, undermining Western support for Ukraine, and shaping potential future military operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Threats to undersea infrastructure are not new. In 2016 U.S. vice admiral James Foggo and Alarik Fritz warned of a “fourth battle of the Atlantic,” which included threats to “underwater infrastructure — such as oil rigs and telecommunications cables.” In 2017 the UK chief of the defence staff went public with previously classified Russian threats to undersea cables that posed a “new risk to our way of life,” while member of the UK Parliament Rishi Sunak (now UK prime minister) demanded enhanced protection of undersea data cables. Yet the Nord Stream incident has catalyzed a new focus in Europe on CUI resilience, including national, multinational, and institutional efforts through NATO and the European Union. Notably, this included the launch of a new NATO Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure at the Vilnius summit in July 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue brief examines NATO’s role in protecting CUI in more detail. It proceeds in four parts: It begins by assessing the threat “seascape” for CUI in northern Europe, including how the threat might evolve and how Europe has responded so far. The paper then turns to NATO’s approach to date, summarizing the key NATO initiatives related to CUI protection. The third part looks in more detail at the challenge of protecting CUI, proposing a basic framework to help understand the vast problem space. The final section draws on this framework to develop several immediate and longer-term recommendations to help planners in NATO’s new center prioritize their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-evolution-of-threats-to-undersea-infrastructure-in-northern-europe&quot;&gt;THE EVOLUTION OF THREATS TO UNDERSEA INFRASTRUCTURE IN NORTHERN EUROPE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has radically altered the threat landscape across Europe, particularly in the north. As the alliance remains focused on supporting Ukraine and shoring up its eastern flank, Sweden’s and Finland’s membership bids will provide new opportunities to deter Russian aggression in the Baltic and Arctic regions. But recent examples of CUI interference highlight vulnerabilities that will not be easily remedied. The sabotage of two Nord Stream pipelines off the Danish island of Bornholm in September 2022 forced European governments to grapple with their limited ability to deter and defend against hybrid tactics in the undersea domain. Recent damage to the Balticconnector gas pipeline and a data cable between Finland and Estonia in October 2023 from a ship’s anchor is suspected as being deliberate, although attribution has not yet been declared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the main focus of critical maritime infrastructure debates has shifted from emphasis on terrorism and cyber threats toward the increasing frequency and efficacy of hybrid tactics. The aim of hybrid tactics is to cause significant damage to an adversary while operating below the threshold of detection, attribution, and response — and in so doing blur the conceptual lines between conflict and peace. The issue is compounded in the maritime realm by several conceptual and practical challenges, mainly related to poor definitions highly dependent on moral or political choices, a unique geophysical space, and the multitude of potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian hybrid tactics represent the most pressing threat to CUI in northern Europe. Russia’s war against Ukraine has debilitated its ground forces and strained its military industrial base. Experts estimate it will take the Kremlin five to ten years to reconstitute its military. Meanwhile, however, Russia’s power projection capabilities in northern Europe — through naval, air, and missile bases in Kaliningrad and its Northern Fleet of submarines on the Kola Peninsula — have scarcely been depleted. In fact, while the Russian navy is underfunded and a large part of its fleet comprises Soviet legacy platforms, its underwater capacity continues to grow. In particular, Russia’s submarine program remains a priority amid other military budget cuts, exemplified by the Kremlin’s authorization of 13 new nuclear and conventional submarines since 2014. In broader terms, Russia’s ability to target critical infrastructure short of war and impose economic costs to deter external intervention in regional conflicts is an important component to Moscow’s doctrine and thinking on escalation management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even in the absence of a broader Russia-NATO conflict, hybrid tactics have been a staple in the Kremlin’s toolbox in Europe for years. As the Kremlin views itself in perpetual conflict with the West, hybrid tactics are instrumental to challenging NATO without resorting to conventional military means. Russia has likely targeted critical infrastructure throughout Europe at an increased frequency since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In the undersea domain, Russia appears committed to mapping and threatening European energy and communications infrastructure, particularly strategically important Norwegian gas pipelines and fiber-optic cables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nord Stream attacks resulted in a flurry of initiatives to bolster Europe’s CUI. The European Union has updated its maritime strategy to better address evolving threats and adopted an expanded directive on CUI resilience, and the EU-NATO Task Force on Resilience of Critical Infrastructure was launched in January and reported its findings in June. The EU Hybrid Toolbox, including the Hybrid Fusion Cell and new Hybrid Rapid Response Teams, support member states and NATO to detect, deter, and respond to threats. More recently, the 10-nation Joint Expeditionary Force ( JEF) agreed to focus on protecting CUI in its new vision and deployed a maritime task force in response to the Balticconnector incident to deter further attacks. Bilateral examples include the recent UK-Norway strategic partnership on undersea threats. Many nations have also expanded their ability to monitor and protect undersea infrastructure: France recently announced a new seabed warfare strategy and investments in ocean floor defense, and the United Kingdom has set up a Centre for Seabed Mapping and earmarked two new Multi-Role Ocean Surveillance (MROS) vessels to serve primarily as subsea protection ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;protecting-critical-undersea-infrastructure-a-new-focus-for-nato&quot;&gt;PROTECTING CRITICAL UNDERSEA INFRASTRUCTURE: A NEW FOCUS FOR NATO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many stakeholders have increased their efforts to protect CUI, NATO remains the lead actor when it comes to deterring and preventing conventional and hybrid attacks on allies. NATO’s role in protecting CUI is grounded in its founding principles, such as Articles 2 and 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which call for the strengthening of free institutions, economic collaboration, and growing resilience to attack. At the 2023 Vilnius summit, allies reiterated that hybrid operations against the alliance could meet the threshold of armed attack and trigger Article 5, NATO’s collective defense guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-value-of-nato&quot;&gt;THE VALUE OF NATO&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the functioning of allied civil society and the prosperity of member states depends on the extensive network of CUI across the Euro-Atlantic. NATO is critical to its protection for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Russia — the primary threat — has the intent and capability, and it maximizes its opportunity to threaten allied CUI across NATO’s area of operational responsibility. Moreover, the destruction, disruption, or tapping of CUI could be the precursor to conflict through attempting to sever military and government communications. Second, the protection of CUI is part of NATO’s defense and deterrence posture across the Euro-Atlantic. As hybrid attacks on CUI may meet the threshold for armed attack, NATO must be heavily invested in their protection to ensure it can act decisively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, CUI spans NATO’s entire area of operational responsibility, so maintaining seamless situational awareness across the whole network is a challenge far too large for individual nations. Fourth, the challenge of protecting CUI will increasingly rely on technological solutions, and NATO possesses the financial heft and mechanisms to develop and scale these. Finally, there are complex political, legal, and technical considerations for the effective protection of CUI, and seams between national permissions and restrictions can create frictions best managed at the NATO level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;natos-approach&quot;&gt;NATO’S APPROACH&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO has been both proactive and reactive to CUI threats. In broad terms, NATO protects CUI in three ways. First, all of NATO’s forces contribute to the alliance’s Defence and Deterrence of the Euro-Atlantic Area (DDA), which coheres all activity by region and domain. Many capabilities that contribute to CUI protection also contribute to wider deterrence activities, including standing naval and mine countermeasures groups and CUI-focused exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, NATO assets detect threats through intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and space and cyber assets to gain and maintain situational awareness. Moreover, NATO can develop and scale new technologies to increase detection coverage, such as the Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA) pilot challenges, which include a focus on energy resilience and sensing and surveillance. The alliance’s new Digital Ocean Concept was endorsed in October 2023 to increase collective visibility of oceans, including&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the creation of a global scale network of sensors, from sea bed to space, to better predict, identify, classify and combat threats. It envisages maritime domain awareness, subsea sensors, unmanned surface vessels, drones and satellites, and exploits AI [artificial intelligence], big data, and autonomous systems, alongside conventional assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, NATO has a range of response options once an incident or attack occurs, including counter hybrid support teams, the NATO Response Force (NRF) and Very High Readiness Task Force (VJTF), and ad hoc force deployments, such as the enhanced maritime patrol and mine hunter deployments in the Baltic Sea. National missions and regional frameworks outside of NATO command structures can also bolster deterrence against threats to CUI, including the JEF and the aforementioned EU initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oQzj8nb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: European Institutions Relevant for Protecting CUI.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ compilation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;natos-new-centers&quot;&gt;NATO’S NEW CENTERS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to recent incidents in the Baltic Sea, NATO has expedited its approach to CUI protection by establishing two new organizations. In February 2023 the Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell was created at NATO headquarters. The rationale was to coordinate allied activity; bring military and civilian stakeholders together by facilitating engagement with private industry, which owns much of the infrastructure; and better protect CUI through jointly detecting and responding to threats. This new cell will be instrumental in building coordination across all the organizations, policies, and capabilities identified in Table 1 both within and external to NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, at the July 2023 Vilnius summit, allies agreed to establish the Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Underwater Infrastructure within NATO’s Allied Maritime Command (MARCOM). This new center focuses on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;identifying and mitigating strategic vulnerabilities and dependencies . . . to prepare for, deter and defend against the coercive use of energy and other hybrid tactics by state and non-state actors. . . . NATO stands ready to support Allies if and when requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The center arrives at a crucial time for NATO as both new threats to CUI and new initiatives to deal with them proliferate across the alliance and beyond. To help NATO planners and staff at the new center conceptualize and prioritize their efforts, the next section considers in more detail the problem of protecting CUI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-threats-to-critical-undersea-infrastructure-a-conceptual-framework&quot;&gt;UNDERSTANDING THREATS TO CRITICAL UNDERSEA INFRASTRUCTURE: A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section develops a basic framework for thinking about protecting CUI. The purpose is to help NATO planners — particularly those in the new center — to understand the vast problem space and prioritize some initial efforts over others. The following section draws on this framework to develop several recommendations. The four elements of the framework for protecting CUI are outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure type:&lt;/strong&gt; What counts as CUI? Which parts are most critical or most vulnerable?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threat type:&lt;/strong&gt; What are the main threats to undersea CUI?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tasks:&lt;/strong&gt; What is NATO’s role in protecting CUI?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geography:&lt;/strong&gt; Where should limited resources be prioritized and focused across the Euro-Atlantic area?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-infrastructure-type&quot;&gt;1. INFRASTRUCTURE TYPE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maritime infrastructure is vital to basic societal functions such as trade, food and energy supplies, security and defense, communications, transport, tourism, and environmental management. The most important infrastructure is usually considered “critical,” meaning without it, society could not function for long. But critical infrastructure differs between nations given that some economies depend on fishing or tourism while others rely more on maritime trade, energy infrastructure, or data cables. What counts as CUI, therefore, is often more of a political decision than a technical one. There is no one-size-fits-all definition: it depends on the nation and region in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maritime infrastructure is often categorized by sector. One classification system lists five types: transport, energy, communication, fishing, and marine ecosystems. Of these, four have substantial elements of underwater infrastructure. Above-water transport is often precluded, while commercial submersibles — such as remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) or autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) used in pipeline maintenance — are considered part of the energy infrastructure they serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maritime infrastructure security policies traditionally focus on maritime transport (e.g., ports) and energy (e.g., gas and oil infrastructure) over other types. However, the infrastructure picture is changing rapidly. Undersea cable projects have proliferated in recent years, while offshore renewable energy technologies like wind and tidal systems will increase to help nations meet global carbon emissions targets. Future proliferation of AUVs — driven by new oil and gas exploration, military applications, reduced manufacturing costs, and improvements in AI and automation technology — could present both new types of CUI under the category of transport and new threats. As the recent NATO-EU task force on critical infrastructure summarizes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These challenges are compounded for undersea energy infrastructure, which is extensive and more difficult to survey and protect. Moreover, the network of undersea energy infrastructure in the Euro-Atlantic area is expected to grow as offshore energy platforms become more numerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, fishing and marine ecosystems are increasingly important to some nations as fishing stocks decrease and marine habitats are degraded by pollution and the effects of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond rapid change, there are several challenges associated with coordinating CUI protection, including interdependence, the physical characteristics of the subsea domain, and the complex, transnational nature of undersea infrastructure. Meanwhile, fishing and marine ecosystems are increasingly important to some nations as fishing stocks decrease and marine habitats are degraded by pollution and the effects of climate change. This suggests a key challenge for NATO will be prioritizing between CUI sectors, which are critical to different NATO allies. This assessment will be driven to some extent by the next element of the framework: the threat picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-threat&quot;&gt;2. THREAT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although most definitions of critical infrastructure depend on how vital it is to the functioning of society, in practice governments tend to designate infrastructure as critical if it is vulnerable to harm. While pipeline sabotage has driven the headlines, the range of threats to CUI is much broader. The threat picture has also changed in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maritime security threats have been driven by the rise of terrorism, international piracy, human trafficking, and the “blue economy,” defined by the World Bank as “the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and ocean ecosystem health.” Protection of maritime and undersea infrastructure has typically focused on physical attacks from terrorism and blue crime (i.e., transnational organized crime at sea). However, the threat environment has changed markedly over the last decade — and drastically since 2022. After invading Ukraine, Russia became “the most significant and direct threat to Allies’ security,” according to NATO’s new Strategic Concept — a threat that includes the ability to “target our civilian and military infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s new concept also points to hybrid threats to critical infrastructure and reaffirms their inclusion under Article 5. The maritime domain has been viewed as particularly vulnerable to hybrid threats. Attacks on underwater infrastructure have been a particular concern. Recent events appear to confirm these fears, with several incidents such as the Nord Stream pipeline explosions in the Baltic Sea or severed subsea cables near Svalbard that appear to follow the hybrid playbook of deniable attacks on undersea infrastructure. These incidents highlight the difficulty of dealing with ambiguous hybrid threats, which are difficult to distinguish from accidental damage. For example, around 70 percent of undersea cable faults are caused by fishing vessels or ship anchors, alongside natural causes or even shark bites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid aggressors can also use the cover of fishing, private, or research vessels, which are difficult to track. The rapid proliferation of AUVs will exacerbate the problem. Specialized vessels for the task also exist, such as Russia’s dedicated fleet of submarines, designed for infrastructure sabotage and manned by the Russian navy and the Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research (GUGI). Research vessels operated by GUGI are suspected of mapping networks of undersea infrastructure across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all these reasons, many assessments suggest a new era of hybrid threats is emerging and poses “a particular challenge” to protecting undersea infrastructure. As the NATO-EU task force puts it, “The seabed is a field of growing strategic importance, due to increasing reliance on undersea infrastructure and the particular challenges in protecting it from hybrid threats and physical damage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-tasks&quot;&gt;3. TASKS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final element of the framework comprises the tasks and missions NATO may have to carry out to protect CUI. The most important role, short of war, is deterrence, which holds the promise of avoiding armed attacks altogether. Beyond deterrence, military forces perform a wide range of roles relevant to protecting CUI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example is counterpiracy. During Operation Ocean Shield — NATO’s contribution to international efforts to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa during 2008–16 — the role of NATO forces spanned surveillance, interdiction, escort, and deterrence. Cooperation with international bodies and the private sector was also vital to mission success, which contributed to the cessation of attacks after 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another relevant example is protecting national infrastructure. The U.S. National Infrastructure Protection Plan outlines threats to national infrastructure and a framework of missions to protect them. These are divided into two tasks: counterthreat missions and preparedness missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Counterthreat missions identify and counter threats and hazards: identify, deter, detect, disrupt, and prepare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preparedness missions reduce vulnerabilities and mitigate the consequences of damage: prevent, protect, mitigate, respond, recover.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, several existing frameworks for countering hybrid threats may be applied to protecting CUI. NATO’s strategy is to “prepare, deter, defend,” while the European Union’s approach is based on “awareness, resilience, and response.” Another framework is proposed by the 14-nation Multinational Capability Development Campaign (MCDC): “detect, deter, and respond.” This framework is used to examine NATO’s role in protecting CUI regarding all three functions below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;detect&quot;&gt;DETECT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countering any threat requires first detecting and identifying it. Detection is even more important for hybrid threats, which rely on deniability or ambiguity to delay, complicate, or prevent reprisal. However, the variety and complexity of hybrid threats make detection challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For protecting CUI, the main focus is on enhancing maritime domain awareness (MDA). MDA systems are “one of the core solutions in maritime security” but are focused on civil transport, fishing, and leisure. To rectify this, a 2018 report by CSIS advocates a renewed focus on undersea MDA to combat hybrid threats. Specific recommendations include establishing dedicated analytic centers (with teams focused on hybrid threats), training courses, a common classified data picture, and an operational framework that integrates surface and subsurface sensors. Another recent analysis recommends closing gaps in the surveillance of small boats, leisure craft, and underwater vehicles through “investments in new underwater sensors and drones which can enhance the overall picture of the domain.” The recent EU-NATO Task Force also recommends enhancing “maritime situational awareness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One detection challenge is that malign activity often appears, by design, as an accident, whereas some suspected attacks could actually be accidents (most damage to cables and pipelines is accidental). This means NATO does not have the luxury of ignoring apparent accidents. Here, a conceptual distinction between monitoring (known threats) and discovering (new, unknown threats) can help establish situational awareness and distinguish signal from noise in the realm of detection. This task is also well suited to advances in AI and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deter&quot;&gt;DETER&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterring hybrid threats to CUI is difficult but not impossible. The most promising strategy is deterrence by denial, which reduces the prospects of successful attack by hardening the target and strengthening resilience to damage. Denial in this context comprises two functions: prevention and resilience (see Figure 3). Preventing attacks is part of NATO’s core business and is achieved through a combination of detection (see above) and physical presence. For example, NATO’s Cold War deterrence strategy of basing substantial “shield forces” in central Europe was designed to physically prevent a Soviet attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilience measures are designed to help CUI systems withstand or quickly recover from any damage sustained. Much of this amounts to good practice in the design and management of critical infrastructure systems. Such measures are therefore generally low cost and less reliant on detecting threats; best practices for resilience are based on understanding and mitigating one’s own vulnerabilities, regardless of whether they have been targeted. This is why resilience measures have become foundational to counter hybrid strategies. However, resilience building is a long-term strategy that will take years to deliver given the vast size and complexity of Euro-Atlantic CUI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;respond&quot;&gt;RESPOND&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, resilience is not a strategy on its own; deterrence by punishment also has a role. When it comes to punishing low-level aggression, celerity beats severity most of the time, putting a premium on credible response options that can be deployed quickly and reliably. These measures may not threaten vital interests but merely assure an aggressor will always face some costs for threatening CUI, however minor. This means simple measures such as enhanced presence or surveillance around key sites can work to deliver what has been referred to as “deterrence by detection.” More creative measures also play a role, such as attribution disclosure, legal interventions, or targeted sanctions (e.g., against implicated vessels, companies, or individuals).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That credible responses are required suggests the utility of a preapproved playbook to counter hybrid threats to CUI. Too often such measures are ad hoc or post hoc, or not sufficiently tailored to the specific demands of protecting CUI. If military forces are part of the response (e.g., to provide surveillance or bolster presence), then a forward, flexible posture is required to ensure force elements are in the area of responsibility or held at high readiness to deploy to quickly generate effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that given the limited resources of allies, any increase in demand to protect CUI will likely require trade-offs with other tasks and missions. Any contribution to protecting CUI is important but not all-important. NATO’s unique role — and the focus of the strategic concept — remains deterring armed attack above the threshold of war, not protecting against all forms of hybrid aggression. Protecting CUI should therefore not be overemphasized in NATO’s overall posture or capability development at the expense of conventional deterrence and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-geography&quot;&gt;4. GEOGRAPHY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final element of the framework is geography. NATO is named after an ocean: the North Atlantic. But the alliance’s undersea infrastructure picture is more complex. NATO’s maritime areas of responsibility comprise the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High North region (including the Norwegian Sea, Greenland Sea, Barents Sea, and Arctic Ocean)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;North Atlantic (including the North Sea, Irish Sea, English Channel, and Bay of Biscay)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mediterranean Sea (east and west)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Black Sea&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;North Pacific Ocean&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within these areas, the seascape of undersea infrastructure is extensive and complex. Figures 1–2 show the extent of underwater energy infrastructure (Figure 1) and subsea data cables (Figure 2) across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While data cables are uniformly spread across the Euro-Atlantic area, the picture is different for energy infrastructure, which is concentrated in northern Europe — namely the North Atlantic (North Sea) and High North (Norwegian Sea). This supply is critical to Europe: in the second quarter of 2023, the European Union imported 44.3 percent of its natural gas (in gaseous state) from Norway and 17.8 percent from the United Kingdom. That 16.5 percent was from Algeria (through three subsea Mediterranean pipelines) also shows the importance of energy infrastructure in southern Europe. This could increase in the future with new projects (such as the EastMed pipeline) and new gas field discoveries as Europe diversifies away from Russian supply. Offshore wind energy infrastructure (along with subsea electrical cables) is also concentrated in northern Europe but present in significant amounts across Europe. Such infrastructure is also expanding quickly: under the European Green Deal, for example, offshore wind energy will expand over 25 times by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, any judgment about prioritizing NATO’s efforts to protect CUI in one region cannot rely on the density of infrastructure alone because all undersea infrastructure is proportionately important to each ally. In addition to including the views of all allies, any assessment must combine geography with the other elements of the framework. This task is explored in the final section of this brief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-winning-the-fourth-battle-of-the-atlantic&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS: WINNING THE FOURTH BATTLE OF THE ATLANTIC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staff at NATO’s new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Underwater Infrastructure do not have the luxury of pondering future threats. NATO’s CUI is under attack right now. This situation may worsen as Russia tries to undermine Western support for Ukraine and cheaper, more advanced AUVs enable a wider range of actors to pose a threat. As Foggo, the former commander of the U.S. Naval Forces Europe and Allied Joint Force Command Naples, puts it: “the fourth battle of the Atlantic is underway.” Like its predecessors, this battle is “a struggle between Russian forces that probe for weakness, and US and NATO anti-submarine warfare (ASW) forces that protect and deter. Just like in the Cold War, the stakes are high.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO and its new center must therefore act quickly. The final section provides a series of recommendations for NATO planners to conceptualize and prioritize their efforts in the coming years. The recommendations comprise two parts. The first is a general assessment of initial priorities for protecting CUI based on the four-part framework developed above. The second builds on this broad assessment to propose more specific and immediate actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;general-assessment-of-initial-priorities-for-protecting-cui&quot;&gt;GENERAL ASSESSMENT OF INITIAL PRIORITIES FOR PROTECTING CUI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section presents a general indicative assessment of NATO’s role in protecting CUI based on the framework discussed in Figure 3. The shaded area suggests where NATO’s initial focus should be for protecting CUI. This assessment is discussed in more detail below, starting with the prioritization criteria for each element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infrastructure Type&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undersea infrastructure may be prioritized for protection by considering the criticality to NATO allies and vulnerability to different threats. Doing so suggests NATO focus on protecting energy and communications infrastructure — the most critical infrastructure to many NATO allies, whose developed economies depend on either importing or exporting energy and transmitting data. Such infrastructure is also the most vulnerable to attack, as recent attacks on pipelines and undersea cables have demonstrated. If further prioritization is required, it should be driven by an analysis of resilience of energy infrastructure compared to data cables: although both are vital and vulnerable, some systems are more resilient and easier to reconfigure in the event of damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to remember undersea infrastructure is much broader than pipelines and cables. Many NATO allies depend on fishing, the health of their marine ecosystems, and maritime security in the broadest sense. The rapid growth of AUVs may transform the transport sector, introducing new types of CUI and new threats. Most importantly, NATO’s approach to protecting CUI will need to incorporate the preferences of all allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Threat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Threats may be prioritized by considering the likelihood and consequences of an attack. With this in mind, NATO should focus on hybrid or gray zone threats to CUI, as these are the most likely threats in the near term. At the same time, the most dangerous threat to NATO allies remains the threat of armed attack on CUI as a prelude to aggression or during conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terrorism targeted at CUI remains a risk, and blue crime is ever present. But other bodies should take the lead (e.g., national police and coast guards, multinational maritime security frameworks), with NATO providing support only where necessary, as with combating large-scale piracy. NATO can contribute to awareness of accidental damage through MDA and crisis response to natural damage and disaster, but these tasks should not drive alliance force structure or posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Task&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of NATO assets in protecting CUI may be prioritized by considering the importance of relevant tasks and their role in NATO’s Strategic Concept. Deterrence and defense is the alliance’s core task. Deterring armed aggression is NATO’s raison d’être and remains its most important task. However, NATO’s capacity to do this is dependent on its general deterrence posture and is not related to the specific problem of protecting CUI — so it is not considered a primary focus here (see Figure 3). Within the context of protecting CUI, NATO should focus on three primary tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detect:&lt;/strong&gt; NATO should focus on detecting threats to CUI, as detection is the foundation of deterrence and critical for removing the cloak of ambiguity around hybrid threats. Detection can be strengthened through enhanced MDA in priority regions. This may require increasing the persistent presence of forces and assets that can contribute to MDA in the maritime, air, space, and cyberspace domains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deter by denial:&lt;/strong&gt; NATO should also focus on strengthening deterrence by denial by improving the defenses that can prevent attacks in the first place. This may also require strengthening the persistent presence of allied forces in regions of concern to protect key sites, reassure vulnerable allies, and deter aggressors. Wider resilience measures can also strengthen denial, but these are judged to be a lower priority for NATO because much of this infrastructure is owned and operated by civilian enterprises, not amenable to military solutions, and already subject to extensive efforts by other actors more suited to boosting public and private sector resilience — such as the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deter by punishment:&lt;/strong&gt; Responses to imminent threats or attacks should prioritize speed and reliability over severity. In the context of deterring low-end hybrid threats (rather than high-end conventional threats) to CUI, this suggests the utility of maritime forces that are forward based in priority regions — or at least persistently present or rapidly deployable (i.e., held at high readiness). More broadly, existing NATO units such as countering hybrid threat teams also have a role to play in immediate incident response and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, although this assessment is focused on protecting allied CUI against hybrid threats, this should not unduly warp NATO’s force posture. Any trade-offs in posture, capability, or readiness to deal with hybrid threats should not come at the expense of the credibility of NATO’s ability to deal with — and thereby deter — armed aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Region&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all subregions within the Euro-Atlantic area are equal when it comes to protecting CUI. The extent of regional energy infrastructure, proximity to advanced Russian undersea capabilities, and track record of recent incidents (attacks and infrastructure mapping) suggest NATO should focus initially on the Baltic, North Atlantic, and High North regions. At the same time, NATO cannot afford to ignore other regions that are critical to allies and where Russian forces and other threats (such as terrorism and blue crime) are known to operate, including the Mediterranean and Black Sea region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;specific-recommendations&quot;&gt;SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general assessment above, combined with the previous discussion of the four framework elements, suggests several more recommendations for NATO’s role in protecting CUI. These are divided into two parts: immediate actions that the new NATO center should implement quickly and longer-term approaches that are equally important but may take more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Immediate Recommendations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a new Standing NATO Maritime Group (SNMG) focused on protecting CUI.&lt;/strong&gt; NATO’s four standing maritime groups are in high operational demand and none are focused on protecting CUI. Considering the growing threat, NATO should consider establishing an “SNMG3” to focus on protecting CUI in northern Europe, focused on the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Norwegian Sea (the areas of highest CUI density). The JEF task group that is currently deployed is a good example but only temporary. The capabilities of the group should include submarines, anti-submarine warfare, maritime surveillance, and seabed mapping, with contributions from allies who specialize in this domain. The group would play a vital role in organizing and delivering the functions of detecting, deterring, and responding to attacks on CUI in priority regions described in this report.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commission a CUI vulnerability triage.&lt;/strong&gt; Any approach to enhancing resilience starts with a vulnerability assessment. An initial triage assessment of criticality versus vulnerability to a range of threats can help MARCOM and NATO direct limited resources to protecting and defending those assets most at risk. The initial assessment presented here forms a starting point, but NATO’s own assessment must consider all forms of infrastructure, threats, regions, and the preferences of all allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a fused MDA picture.&lt;/strong&gt; A critical step in transforming MDA to improve detection and identification of threats to CUI will be fusing the existing intelligence picture across nations, the private and public sectors, and multinational and maritime domains (e.g., air, sea, subsea, space, and cyber). Assessing the highest-priority infrastructure and threats can help identify which ISR capabilities and combinations not currently available to MARCOM are necessary to rapidly attribute malign activity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Produce regular CUI threat assessments.&lt;/strong&gt; NATO already produces maritime threat assessments for governments and the commercial sector that focus on threats such as terrorism — for example, through the NATO Maritime Shipping Centre (MSC). These should either be expanded to include threats to CUI or be dedicated assessments that focus on nontraditional hybrid threats to CUI.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarify the role of NATO’s Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell.&lt;/strong&gt; The cell is based in NATO headquarters, but its wide remit — which includes industry and civil-military engagement, best practice, and technology — and senior leadership may overlap with the new MARCOM center. The coordination cell could perform the role the MSC did during Ocean Shield of protecting CUI, which will be even more important given CUI is mostly owned and operated by private companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement a CUI exercise program.&lt;/strong&gt; Exercises are a vital part of NATO’s deterrence and reassurance efforts and have been stepped up over the last year. Yet CUI exercises have been limited and focused on technology. A wider CUI exercise program using existing assets would deliver wider effects to deter adversaries and reassure allies and industry partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update NATO’s maritime strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; NATO’s maritime strategy is over 12 years old, does not mention Russia or China, and mentions undersea infrastructure only in passing. It needs updating to reflect the new threat environment and NATO’s new Strategic Concept — including a focus on protecting CUI. The new center should have a lead role in producing a new strategy — or at least a “Protecting CUI” annex.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Longer-Term Recommendations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a NATO CUI resilience strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; Building on the vulnerability assessment, a longer-term effort that the new center could lead is developing a NATO CUI resilience strategy. This would meet NATO’s Strengthened Resilience Commitment and could inform (and be informed by) a NATO resilience planning process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopt a NATO CUI preparedness goal.&lt;/strong&gt; As part of a strengthened approach to CUI resilience, allies could commit to a NATO CUI preparedness goal to bolster national and pan-NATO approaches to preparing for attacks on CUI.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a risk management approach.&lt;/strong&gt; The sheer variety of threats to CUI and the number of potential targets require an approach that prioritizes and manages risk. Even better than a risk-centric strategy would be an uncertainty-centric approach that seeks robustness against a range of unknowable threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a CUI attack response playbook.&lt;/strong&gt; Effective deterrence against CUI attacks requires a credible and reliable set of measures to respond to threats or attacks on CUI. A counter-CUI playbook of military (and nonmilitary) response options would help. This playbook could also be the basis of a robust exercise program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopt a framework nation approach to regional CUI protection.&lt;/strong&gt; A regional framework nation approach to protecting CUI could help tailor CUI protection to the differing concerns of regional allies. One example is the JEF, newly focused on protecting northern Europe’s CUI. Whatever the framework, any regional approach to protecting CUI should be directed by the alliance’s DDA concept, NATO’s guiding framework for all operations short of war, and align with new regional plans agreed at the Vilnius summit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，法官杜麗冰指，有見本地傳媒上周報導稱法庭拒絕被告申請海外證人以視像形式作供，特此澄清《刑事訴訟程序條例》規定，海外證人如要作供，須在案件交付至高院後42日之內提出申請，但本案並無任何人申請海外證人作供，也沒有任何申請要求延長42日期限。代表黎的資深大律師彭耀鴻及代表3間蘋果公司的大律師王國豪在庭上確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方爭議煽動刊物罪超出檢控時限-法庭無司法管轄權處理&quot;&gt;辯方爭議煽動刊物罪超出檢控時限 法庭無司法管轄權處理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英就控罪答辯之前，其代表資深大律師彭耀鴻先就「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪逾時檢控提出爭議。控方案情指稱黎智英與其他被告於2019年4月1日起，一同串謀發布煽動刊物，該串謀直至2021年6月24日《蘋果日報》停運為止。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭指，根據《刑事罪行條例》第11條，煽動控罪的檢控「只可於犯罪後6個月內開始進行」；而據《刑事罪行條例》第159D條，對於依據協議而犯下的串謀罪行，若果提出檢控的時限已經屆滿，便不能就該串謀罪行「提出法律程序」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭續指，若果由串謀的首天2019年4月1日起計，檢控時限是同年10月1日；若法庭不接納，由最後一天2021年6月24日起計算，控方的檢控時限亦是同年12月24日。然而黎在12月28日的法庭聆訊上才被正式加控「煽動刊物」罪，已逾時4日。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭指，逾時檢控的問題關乎法庭是否有司法管轄權處理控罪，若果超過檢控時限，法庭便沒有司法管轄權處理「煽動刊物」控罪，且本案涉及新聞自由等基本權利，應以較寬鬆的尺度詮釋法例，但對於控方應較嚴謹。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官質疑串謀屬持續-辯方指不能以此避過檢控時限&quot;&gt;法官質疑串謀屬持續 辯方指不能以此避過檢控時限&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問及，若果串謀並非一次性，而是持續一系列的串謀呢？彭耀鴻回應，若果串謀罪行只是一次性，檢控時限便須由作出串謀的首天起開始計算。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰亦指，本案被告是持續干犯一連串的罪行，若控方分成多項控罪提控，並如辯方所指運用相同的檢控時限，或會出現較早干犯的控罪超出檢控時限、而較遲干犯的控罪則在時限之內檢控的情況；又質疑後來加入串謀者便不能被控。彭耀鴻同意，但強調控方可分開檢控，亦須及時檢控，不能以串謀來繞過檢控時限。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰又問及，若被告人不在香港，但在海外導致煽動刊物在香港發布，控方便未能趕在檢控限期內將他帶上法庭提控。彭耀鴻則指，同樣的檢控期限依然適用，被告人依然受到條例所規定的時限保護。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方帶上法庭加控始算開始進行檢控-控方仍違檢控時限&quot;&gt;辯方：帶上法庭加控始算開始進行檢控 控方仍違檢控時限&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就控方於2021年12月13日曾去信法庭表示「有意」申請新增煽動刊物罪、黎智英於翌日獲悉，彭耀鴻認為控方當時並未將黎帶上法庭正式加控，至12月28日才正式加控，故即使採納12月24日為檢控期限，仍然超出檢控時限4天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭解釋，《刑事罪行條例》第11條列明煽動罪須於6個月內「開始進行（begun）」檢控，是立法時特意選用的字眼，強調直至控方把黎智英帶上法庭加控，才算「開始進行」檢控，而非如控方據《裁判官條例》第26條所指，於12月13日去信表示有意加控，「作出申訴或提出告發（making any complaint or laying any information）」，便可視為已「開始進行」檢控。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《裁判官條例》第26條，若罪行無規定作出申訴或提出告發的時效，則「申訴或告發」須於6個月內作出或提出。彭認為，只有很少罪行會訂明檢控時限，若《刑事罪行條例》第11條已為煽動罪訂明檢控時限，則將兩條法例的字眼理解為同一意思，會令《刑事罪行條例》第11條變得完全多餘，故「開始進行」檢控必定指「作出申訴或提出告發」以外的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明續審，彭耀鴻將繼續陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

Most importantly, they are difficult to detect — defeating them will require elevated sensors, on aircraft or satellites, to track them at range.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;As the Department of Defense begins to deploy a space-based sensor constellation, Getting on Track unpacks the design tradeoffs involved and key pitfalls to avoid. Using advanced simulation tools, the authors underscore the necessity of diversifying satellite orbits, designing constellations for early, persistent coverage, and retaining requirements for fire-control-capable sensors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new, elevated sensor architecture is required to detect, identify, and track a spectrum of maneuvering missile threats with sufficient quality to support missile defense fire control. These threats combine high speeds, unpredictable, non-ballistic trajectories, and large raid sizes to stress legacy defense designs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The future of missile defense and missile defeat will be contingent on the development, characteristics, and fielding timeline of this architecture. One cannot defend against what one cannot see.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as a perfect sensor architecture design. Designing an elevated sensor architecture is rather an exercise in tradeoffs. Given this multiplicity of trades, architecture design is as much an art as a science. The application of this art to specific designs reflects various institutional and policy assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unpacking these tradeoffs and assumptions — making them explicit — can help policymakers, budgeteers, and system architects, and better inform the public discussion related to missile tracking and missile defense. Doing so is the purpose of this report. This report does not advocate a particular architecture, but instead elaborates these tradeoffs, identifies principles to inform future architectures, and highlights temptations to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No single orbit or domain represents an optimal approach for missile defense sensing. Low (LEO), medium (MEO), geosynchronous (GEO), and highly elliptical orbits (HEO) each contribute varied advantages for coverage, schedule, cost, and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proliferating space sensors in LEO is one way to improve resilience, assuming large numbers and low-cost replacement. It is not the only way. Reliance on a single orbital regime, or on any single approach to resilience, invites disruption. LEO constellations can be degraded by area- or domain-wide effects, including electronic attack, nuclear or radiological means, and the intentional generation of debris.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense’s recently updated plan to deploy a mixed-orbit missile tracking constellation is thus a welcome step for enhancing resilience. Sensor architectures should complicate adversary targeting by leveraging the unique benefits and drawbacks of multiple orbits and domains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deployment phasing of a sensor architecture is as critical as its final delivery date. Choices over orbital configurations not only affect final sensor coverage but how coverage develops over time. Sensor constellations optimized purely for coverage efficiencies do not necessarily generate persistent coverage until most elements are deployed. For nearer-term coverage, especially for the lower latitudes relevant to the Indo-Pacific and other theaters, policymakers should be attentive to the pacing of sensor fielding, not only the final product — graceful deployment as well as graceful degradation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While a space-based sensor architecture is necessary for global missile tracking coverage, a suborbital underlay of airborne sensors could improve point or regional coverage, hedge against schedule or capability gaps of orbiting sensors, and enhance overall system-level survivability. Airborne sensors offer unique detection modalities and could support persistent, localized coverage unbounded by the predictability and rigidity of orbital mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sensor fusion is a major and underappreciated source of schedule risk. Delays in developing sensor fusion software and infrastructure contributed significantly to past space program cost and schedule overruns. Further steps are needed to prioritize command and control and fusion algorithm development for larger satellite constellations and multiple sensor types.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fire control-quality tracking must be a fundamental requirement for the emergent elevated sensing architecture. The technical requirements for fire control tracks are relative measures, contingent on the performance of other elements in the missile defense kill chain. Less stringent track data requirements would require interceptors with costlier, more capable seekers or more ability to maneuver to compensate for positional uncertainties. Conversely, more accurate sensor data would both improve the performance of existing systems and ease design requirements for future interceptors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infrared sensor performance is a function of the target’s signature and the sensor’s resolution, sensitivity, and field of view. Both wide- and medium-field-of-view sensors share promise for fire control-quality tracking. In recent years, Congress has prudently scrutinized and sustained efforts to deploy fire control sensors, including the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS), which is slated to transfer from the Missile Defense Agency to the Space Force around 2026. Whatever the sensor configuration and type, it is imperative that fire control efforts cross the valley of death and deploy at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of the technologies and programs to realize an elevated sensor architecture are in place, but a disciplined acquisition and systems engineering authority will be needed to align its many components. Policymakers must exert oversight to ensure schedule discipline, orbital and systems diversity, and continued attention to missile defense fire control requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Acquiring this new elevated sensor architecture will be an exercise in avoiding certain temptations. These include temptations to optimize global coverage efficiencies at the expense of schedule and resilience, to consolidate assets into a single orbital regime, and to abdicate fire control requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-elevated-sensing-imperative&quot;&gt;The Elevated Sensing Imperative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this new missile age, adversaries and allies alike are acquiring a broad spectrum of standoff capabilities. New and emerging categories of weapons include hypersonic glide vehicles, scramjet cruise missiles, maneuvering reentry vehicles, and orbital bombardment systems. These and other advanced missiles have become “weapons of choice” for competitors, who are conceiving new means to evade legacy missile defenses and hold critical assets at risk. The sophistication, diversity, and number of missile threats continue to advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflicts in Ukraine and elsewhere have confirmed the centrality of missile strike and the corresponding need for missile defense. As part of a comprehensive approach, active missile defenses have become foundational to broad deterrence and defense goals. Today’s missile defense capabilities, however, are coming under increasing stress. Today’s spectrum of threats leverage high speeds, unpredictable maneuvers, and different trajectories to exploit gaps and seams in legacy missile defenses. New classes of hypersonic missiles, for instance, threaten to underfly the radar horizons of surface-based radars, leaving insufficient time for a defender to react (Figure 1). One cannot defend against what one cannot see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contending with these threats will require specific attention to modernizing the sensor architecture. The missile defense enterprise requires elevated sensors to detect, identify, and track them before and after launch. Compared to surface-based sensors, those on satellites or aircraft offer longer lines of sight for tracking hypersonic and other advanced missile systems. As such, the 2022 Missile Defense Review noted that space-based sensing will be “critical to any future integrated sensor network.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elevated sensing has thus become an acquisition priority for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). Through its component Space Development Agency (SDA) and Space Systems Command (SSC), the U.S. Space Force has invested billions to acquire space-based sensors for missile warning and tracking (Figure 3). The Missile Defense Agency (MDA), meanwhile, is prototyping space sensors for missile defense fire control — the process of guiding interceptors to an incoming threat (Figure 2). These and other stakeholders have advanced different visions for the future sensor architecture. The question now is how to reconcile and implement these visions, and on what timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;elevated-sensing-missions&quot;&gt;Elevated Sensing Missions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DoD is developing satellite constellations to perform multiple sensing missions, including missile warning, missile tracking, and fire control (Table 1). These lines of effort include the Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) and Resilient Missile Warning/Missile Tracking (RMW/MT) satellite constellations, which will recapitalize existing missile warning capabilities and track hypersonic and advanced missile threats throughout their trajectory, from birth to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While significant work on next-generation missile warning satellites continues, such efforts are not discussed here in detail. This report is instead focused on efforts to develop space-based missile tracking capabilities, especially for fire control — activities traditionally performed with ground- and sea-based radars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9oEcYdk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Missile Defense Space Assets.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Missile Defense Agency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States currently relies on the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites to provide global missile warning — persistent notification of missile launches in support of strategic nuclear deterrence and other defense and intelligence missions. As contributors to the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) Overhead Persistent Infrared Architecture (BOA), SBIRS and other sensors support the Missile Defense System (MDS) by providing early missile tracking data to cue its broader network of sensors. This initial detection sets the missile defense targeting process in motion, cueing a sophisticated network of ground and maritime radars to determine the positions, trajectories, and signatures of ballistic missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As incoming missiles continue to fly, the MDS synthesizes sensor measurement data into three-dimensional “tracks”: estimations of the missile’s position and trajectory. Different sensors deliver track information at different quality levels, with different degrees of latency and positional uncertainty, for different numbers of threat objects. These tracks must then be fused together into a single, trusted picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one thing to know that some number of missiles have been launched and that they are headed in a general direction. It is another to know how many, where they will be at a given moment, and thus how to defeat them. Using sufficiently accurate tracking data, a missile defense system can develop a fire control solution, determining when to launch one or more interceptors, what trajectory the interceptors should travel, and other considerations for engaging the targets. “Fire control-quality” tracks are those with the position and time accuracy sufficient for a missile defense system to generate an intercept solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/n02uRIk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Elevated Sensing Missions.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical requirements for fire control-quality tracks are relative measures, contingent on the performance of other elements in the missile defense kill chain. Less stringent track data requirements would require interceptors with costlier, more capable seekers or more ability to maneuver to compensate for positional uncertainties. Conversely, more accurate sensor data would both improve the performance of existing systems and ease design requirements for future interceptors. General James Dickinson, commander of U.S. Space Command, recently noted that fire control-quality tracking “is going to determine the success or failure of whatever weapon system you’re employing to defeat that threat.” Realizing it is therefore “exceptionally important.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the functions of future missile defense engagements will remain similar to those of the past, the characteristics of several new classes of missile threats will impose new requirements for the sensing architecture. Surface-based tracking of new and emergent maneuvering missile threats remains both useful and necessary for the spectrum of missile threats, but it is insufficient for some of the newer types. Earth’s geometry limits surface-based radar from detecting and engaging lower-flying targets, including hypersonic weapons. Given these new threats, missile defenses require elevated sensors for the missile tracking mission, and to do so with more highly detailed, lower-latency trajectory estimations to support the fire control mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“Fire control-quality” tracks are those with the position and time accuracy sufficient for a missile defense system to generate an intercept solution.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving this vision will carry enormous challenges. The effective employment of fire control quality tracks will require new processing, networking, and sensor fusion capabilities to synthesize missile tracks and compute fire control solutions. Precise tracking furthermore demands attention to a wide variety of new threat signatures, the presence of background clutter, future countermeasures, and other challenges. Addressing these problems will be difficult, but it must be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requirements for the future elevated sensor architecture are tightly coupled with every other aspect of the missile defense kill chain. Sensor design requirements drive interceptor design requirements — the schedule for one affects the schedule for the other. Sensor capability may therefore be compared to a locomotive that pulls other missile defense capabilities forward. In the words of Frank Turner, technical director of the Space Development Agency, “Schedule is king. The train is going to leave the station on time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;2023-national-defense-authorization-act&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;2023 National Defense Authorization Act&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“In carrying out the analysis of candidate fire control architectures, the Secretary of the Air Force shall ensure that the Director of the Space Warfighting Analysis Center of the Space Force, at a minimum, maintains the requirements needed for the missile defense command and control, battle management, and communications system to pass the needed quality data within the timelines needed for current and planned interceptor systems to support engagements of ballistic and hypersonic threats.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;unpacking-the-tradeoffs-art-and-science&quot;&gt;Unpacking the Tradeoffs: Art and Science&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as a perfect sensor architecture design. Designing an elevated sensor architecture is rather an exercise in tradeoffs. There are, for instance, a multiplicity of trades among orbital altitudes and inclinations, sensor phenomenologies, and other variables. Assumptions about future threats to the architecture influence final design configurations and standards for survivability and resilience. Decisions about schedule, or when certain capabilities are necessary, likewise affect technical requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/d8SpAR0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: SDA Tracking Layer Deployment.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Space Development Agency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this multiplicity of trades, architecture design is as much an art as a science. The application of this art in specific force designs reflects institutional and policy assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These system- and architecture-wide tradeoffs have been all too implicit in the public conversation about sensor architecture acquisition, presenting an oversight challenge. The number of considerations makes it difficult to define clear metrics for success, a challenge made more complex by the number of stakeholders involved and continual revisions made to their architectures. Clearer goalposts are needed to understand, align, and implement an acquisition strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unpacking these tradeoffs and assumptions — making them explicit — can help policymakers, budgeteers, and systems architects, and better inform the public discussion related to missile tracking and missile defense. Doing so is the purpose of this report. This report does not advocate a particular architecture but instead elaborates these tradeoffs, describes ongoing acquisition efforts, and identifies policy temptations to avoid. From these, three principles become relevant to the acquisition of a future architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Given this multiplicity of trades, architecture design is as much an art as a science.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One principle is that &lt;strong&gt;an elevated sensor architecture should be diversified across multiple orbits and domains.&lt;/strong&gt; Technological advancements in commercial space have generated enthusiasm for proliferated, commoditized low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations. Surviving a peer threat, however, will demand more. Proliferating space sensors in LEO is one way to improve resilience, assuming large numbers and low-cost replacement. It is not the only way. Reliance on a single orbital regime, or on any single approach to resilience, invites disruption. LEO constellations can be degraded by area- or domain-wide effects, including electronic attack, nuclear or radiological means, and the intentional generation of debris. For further altitude diversification, a suborbital underlay of airborne sensors could improve point or regional coverage, hedge against schedule or capability gaps of orbiting sensors, and enhance overall system-level survivability. As tempting as it may be to consolidate acquisition efforts to one orbital domain, a multi-orbit and multi-domain architecture is likely to be more survivable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another principle is that &lt;strong&gt;an elevated sensor architecture should deploy gracefully.&lt;/strong&gt; The deployment phasing of a new sensor architecture is as critical as its final delivery date. Some constellation designs do not generate persistent coverage until nearly all elements are deployed. For nearer-term coverage, especially for the lower latitudes of the Indo-Pacific, policymakers should be attentive to the pacing of sensor fielding, not only the final product — graceful deployment as well as graceful degradation. Lower-inclined orbits or airborne assets may be useful for early coverage of critical areas. Sensor fusion is another major and underappreciated source of schedule risk. More must be done to accelerate development of software and ground systems to knit these pieces together. Schedule is king.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;an elevated sensor architecture must deliver fire control-quality tracking to support active missile defense.&lt;/strong&gt; Requirements for data quality should be developed in close connection with the characteristics and limitations of interceptors or other effectors. While much attention has been paid to developing elevated missile warning and missile tracking capabilities, Congress has prudently scrutinized and sustained efforts to deploy fire control sensors. Whether through the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS), its derivatives, or some future wide-field-of-view sensor, it is necessary to accelerate and scale a fire control sensor network for the missile defense mission. In recent years, SDA has taken valuable additional steps to incorporate fire control sensors in its proliferated constellation. It is worth considering how to sustain this momentum and achieve fire control capability in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;modeling-the-problem&quot;&gt;Modeling the Problem&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report’s analysis is informed in large part by internal modeling and simulation conducted by the CSIS Missile Defense Project (MDP). The research team used ANSYS/AGI’s Systems Toolkit (STK) and Iroquois Systems/Lockheed Martin’s SMARTSet tools to model key tradeoffs in constellation design. Many of the images included resulted from optimization studies involving nearly a million simulations and numerous days of computing time. To speed this process, MDP acquired and assembled dedicated hardware to accelerate computing tasks. Further details on modeling and methodology are described in the appendix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team modeled constellation and sensor design tradeoffs in STK’s synthetic environment. To visualize the infrared signatures pictured in the report, MDP leveraged the STK Electro-optical Infrared (EOIR) simulation module, creating a scenario (Figure 4) to investigate hypersonic tracking challenges. To construct the scene, the team created original 3D models of notional hypersonic weapons (Figures 5 and 7) and imported and processed National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) infrared terrain data (Figure 6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, MDP performed optimization studies to assess how different constellation designs could impact sensor coverage. The research team conducted basic assessments of altitude, coverage, and custody against hypersonic targets using SMARTSet and performed more detailed analyses with STK’s Analyzer tool, which can automatically test and evaluate design possibilities. Many of these analyses revolved around constellation designs and their impact on sensor coverage; these are pictured throughout the report. The number of potential designs evaluated encompassed nearly one million simulation runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These studies are useful for describing the tradeoffs at play in acquiring an elevated sensor architecture. It is a low-fidelity modeling effort, and intentionally so — meant to illustrate high-level principles rather than prescribe specific designs. Scenarios were constructed to be generalizable and reproducible, and to demonstrate the relationship between changing sensor fields of view, inclinations, altitudes, and other variables. The constellations and sensors described herein are not presented as recommendations. They are meant to inform the conversation and draw out unexamined assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sensor-tradeoffs&quot;&gt;Sensor Tradeoffs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any discussion of design tradeoffs must begin with the sensors themselves. Constellation designs for missile tracking are constrained by the performance of their sensors, which must be able to distinguish the signatures of hypersonic and ballistic weapons and resolve their positions accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although many approaches are possible, the United States has historically addressed the space-based missile sensing problem with infrared sensors, which passively detect the thermal signatures of threat missiles. Infrared and other electro-optical sensors can meet the demanding size, weight, and power requirements of space-based platforms and have continued to improve in resolution, sensitivity, and cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these technologies are mature, missile tracking and fire control with infrared sensors is more challenging than missile warning. Today’s geosynchronous missile warning sensors can detect the large, hot exhaust plumes of missiles as they launch but cannot provide detailed tracking information after this initial boost phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future missile tracking and fire control sensors must be capable of tracking hypersonic weapon signatures beyond the boost phase, where their infrared signatures diminish (Figure 8). Distinguishing a hypersonic heat signature against the Earth’s background has been likened to tracking “a slightly brighter candle in a sea of candles,” requiring extensive testing to validate.&lt;/p&gt;

Given the sensor’s resolution, the missile is too dim to visually distinguish from surrounding objects (top). Detecting them requires computational processing, in this case by compositing multiple frames and computing the motion of pixels (center). An enlarged crop of the false-color image at center emphasizes the extracted hypersonic signature (bottom). Further details are available in the appendix.

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sensors-field-of-view-and-architecture&quot;&gt;Sensors, Field of View, and Architecture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These and other factors affect the number and configuration of sensor platforms in an architecture. By flying lower than hypersonic and ballistic weapons, air-based sensors offer advantageous views of hot hypersonic weapons against cold space backdrops — but lack the extended sightlines of space-based sensors. Space sensor constellations, meanwhile, must be carefully optimized for a variety of factors, including solar exclusion (viewing angles where sunlight overwhelms the sensor), orbital dynamics, and other variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An infrared sensor architecture must also be sized to ensure coverage by two sensors at once. Unlike with radar, a single infrared imaging sensor cannot resolve a target’s position in three dimensions. Two sensors — simultaneously viewing the target — are needed to triangulate a three-dimensional track of a missile’s altitude, position, and heading (Figure 12). Stereo (two-sensor) or greater tracking is a baseline requirement for infrared sensor constellations. Additional redundancy may be needed to account for survivability constraints, maintenance downtime, and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most critically, each sensor’s FOR can affect the number of satellites necessary for a space-based sensing constellation. Sensors with a wide FOR can view a wider area of Earth’s surface, either by pivoting across a wide swath or by possessing a wide-angle optic (Figure 13). Even relatively minor changes in FOR can have considerable effects on coverage footprint and, consequently, the number of required satellites (Figure 14). For instance, a given 91-satellite constellation at 1,000 km can provide persistent global coverage with a 120-degree FOR but cannot do so with 110-degree or 100-degree FORs (Figures 16 and 17).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Hq8Fqmt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 13: Satellite Field of Regard.&lt;/strong&gt; The three satellites visualized are in low Earth orbit (1,000 km) and have total sensor fields of regard of 100, 110, and 118 degrees, respectively. At this altitude, the curvature of the Earth limits increases in line of sight beyond 120 degrees. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HJGaQFZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting wider FORs reduces the number of satellites needed for coverage, but doing so imposes additional requirements on the sensor itself. For fixed sensors, increasing sensor FOR requires an increase in the sensor field of view (FOV), the angle of view immediately viewable by the sensor. In other words, fixed-sensor FOR and FOV are identical. The Space Development Agency’s Tracking Layer satellites leverage fixed sensors — its Tranche 0 satellites are required to possess a FOR/FOV of 70 to 110 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sensor’s FOR can be larger than its FOV if it is mechanically pointed (slewed) to view a wider area. This approach is technically mature and was leveraged in past efforts, such as in the Precision Tracking Space System and SBIRS missile-warning satellites (Figure 19). Mechanical slewing allows a narrower-FOV sensor to offer a large possible coverage — or access — footprint at the cost of mechanical complexity and challenges in managing vibration, pointing error, and slewing time. As these sensors cannot view every part of their FOR at once, they introduce additional considerations for tracking large numbers of targets in various regions: on which targets to view, in what order, and how rapidly to revisit them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tradeoffs — between fixed and slewing, wide and narrow — are important because changes in sensor FOV affect detection performance. Holding all factors equal, increasing a sensor’s FOV will increase its pixel footprint, as each pixel on the sensor’s focal plane array (FPA) corresponds to a wider swath of the Earth’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qz7StYi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 15: Pixel Footprint, Field of View, and Sensitivity Tradeoffs.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larger pixel footprints, in turn, make it more challenging to track missile targets (Figure 14). Because hypersonic signatures are smaller than most sensor pixel footprints, their location becomes more difficult to distinguish as the pixel footprint expands (Figure 15). Moreover, larger pixel footprints increasingly “dilute” the brightness of the hypersonic signature with the signature of the surrounding terrain. The problem is akin to detecting a cup of boiling water poured into a swimming pool; a smaller pixel footprint is akin to detecting that same cup poured into a bucket. Holding all else equal, FOV influences performance and drives design decisions between slewed and fixed sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/M0mKxjL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 16: Field of Regard and Coverage: 100-, 110-, and 120-Degree Sensors.&lt;/strong&gt; These three-dimensional views illustrate the stereo sensor coverage of a 91-satellite, 1,000 km altitude constellation. Stereo coverage, the minimum necessary, is depicted in yellow; red areas represent simultaneous coverage by eight or more satellites.

&lt;p&gt;Sensors with either narrower FOVs or more pixels can minimize these pixel footprints, thereby improving detection performance. Developments in wide-field-of-view (WFOV) sensors have been driven by developments in large-format FPAs with higher pixel counts: infrared sensors with 4,000 pixel-by-4,000 pixel (4K), 6K, 8K, or higher resolutions (Figure 18). Space Systems Command’s testbed geosynchronous WFOV satellite, for instance, leverages a large-format FPA with a 4K resolution. Early Tranche 0 technical requirements call for fixed sensors with an objective FOV of roughly 110 degrees and a pixel footprint of under 1.5 km, necessitating large FPAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infrared sensor industry has continued to develop larger FPA formats, which allow the use of wider FOVs without performance compromise. But there may be some missions where WFOV, fixed-sensor approaches are challenging. The Missile Defense Agency’s HBTSS satellites, for instance, will use a mechanically slewed medium-FOV (MFOV) sensor to shrink pixel footprints and allow fine-grained, fire control-quality missile tracking. Choices between fixed WFOV and slewing MFOV sensors are dependent on the availability, maturity, and cost of these large-format FPAs. In the near term, smaller-format FPAs are available at larger quantities and lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size and performance of a constellation thus depends on these interlocking choices: between fixed and slewing sensors, sensor FOV, FPA format, and other factors. Maximizing sensor FOR allows a designer to minimize the satellites necessary for coverage. Doing so demands fixed sensors with wider fields of view or slewing sensors with narrower ones. System architects must balance a complex set of variables, each of which influences nearly every other aspect of the system (Figure 20).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternative-sensor-types&quot;&gt;Alternative Sensor Types&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infrared sensors are not the only means of tracking missiles from space. Hypersonic weapons emit unique signatures that can be exploited. Alternative sensor modalities, including hyperspectral and radiofrequency sensors, might therefore play important roles. A future sensor architecture could leverage multiple sensor types to track hypersonic and other advanced missile threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyperspectral or ultraviolet sensors, capable of viewing alternative bands of light, could be relevant for detecting hypersonic weapons’ novel signatures. In hypersonic flight, an object’s surface reacts with high-temperature airflow to release a wake of ions, gases, particles, and other chemical byproducts. These byproducts and their signatures might be detectable in infrared and alternative spectra (Figure 22). As with hypersonic defense, “the same characteristics that make hypersonic weapons attractive present the defender with new failure modes to exploit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Infrared sensors are not the only means of tracking missiles from space.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radiofrequency sensors might offer further utility. Radar offers many advantages: its principles are well understood, it can propagate through complex weather conditions, and it can instantaneously gather target velocity data. Radars have become increasingly sophisticated and efficient; emerging multistatic and multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) radar technologies might offer additional utilities to the space-based hypersonic tracking problem. In addition to active methods, it may be possible to passively intercept radio emissions from data-linked missiles. The 2022 Missile Defense Review notably stated that global and persistent “space-based . . . radar . . . systems will be critical to any future integrated sensor network.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6FZzfOC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 22: Booster Plume Signatures and Hypersonic Plasma.&lt;/strong&gt; Solid rocket boosters used to launch hypersonic weapons generate detectable infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) signatures. The simulated plume signature (top) represents a broad range of physical phenomena, including the hot gas flow from the booster, external hypersonic airflow, the combusted gas and alumina particles from the burning motor, and the phase change of alumina particles. A hypersonic weapon in its glide phase encounters similarly complex interactions, generating novel wake signatures. Plasmas generated around the hypersonic weapon surface, for instance, react with gas products and particles burned off the vehicle surface (bottom).

Sears Memorial Professor and Director of Center for National Security Initiatives, University of Colorado, Boulder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, infrared and other types of electro-optical sensors have continued to improve. Infrared focal plane arrays, sensor readouts, and their cooling systems have become increasingly reliable and affordable; new developments might allow simplified configurations that do not require cryogenic cooling. Furthermore, the maturation of large-format infrared FPAs are allowing increases in FOV without corresponding resolution losses (Figure 21).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is scoped to the infrared sensors being acquired today. But hypersonic weapons present novel signatures, enabling new approaches to detection and tracking. Provided that sensor fusion challenges can be resolved, a future architecture should integrate advancements in infrared FPAs, multispectral and radiofrequency sensors, and other means. Combining these multiple types will allow greater persistence and capability if one type is degraded, whether from environmental conditions, enemy deception, or other means of signature reduction. While it may be possible to evade one part of the electromagnetic spectrum, it is harder to evade several of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;orbital-tradeoffs&quot;&gt;Orbital Tradeoffs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensor performance influences the number of assets necessary to provide coverage, but there are other tradeoffs to consider. “No absolute rules” govern the design of an optimal constellation. It is possible to track hypersonic weapons from many orbits given the correct selection of sensor payloads. At the same time, better design points exist for meeting current and future threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter reviews relevant orbits for missile sensing and identifies how they could be mixed to generate efficiencies. Basic changes in altitude and domain can impact every other aspect of performance. A more resilient constellation should mix orbits and domains in ways that maximize the advantages of each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;low-earth-orbit&quot;&gt;Low Earth Orbit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marked advances in space launch and satellite manufacturing have made low Earth orbits (LEO) increasingly popular for deploying satellite constellations. Legacy satellite programs often struggled with a “vicious circle between high reliability and high costs.” High unit costs incentivized the use of expensive components to prevent failure, and the use of expensive components contributed to high unit cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent declines in launch cost have enabled a paradigm shift in constellation design (Figure 23). Commercial actors have broken vicious cost-reliability cycles by embracing rapid replenishment over exquisite designs. As it becomes more affordable to place satellites in orbit, it becomes possible to proliferate larger numbers of satellites, which in turn enables economies of scale in satellite manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9lX9jcx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image24&quot; /&gt;

A bubble’s size corresponds to the number of successful orbital launches achieved by that vehicle as of December 31, 2019. Source: CSIS Aerospace Security Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift has made LEO orbits increasingly popular for commercial applications. Of the over 6,700 satellites in orbit, over 80 percent now operate in the LEO regime, where their proximity to Earth suits them for high-resolution remote sensing and low-latency communications. This philosophy — a proliferated low Earth orbit (pLEO) architecture — has informed recent approaches to national defense space systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EFFECTS OF PROXIMITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mathematics of proximity operate in favor of LEO satellite constellations. At LEO altitudes — between 400 and 2,000 km above Earth — even smaller sensors can provide high-resolution imagery of Earth’s surface. Further distances demand larger apertures; aperture limits the maximum resolution attainable by an infrared sensor (Figure 24). Holding other parameters constant, a sensor placed in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) requires an aperture several times larger to attain comparable resolution to one orbiting at 500 km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optical apertures are a significant driver of satellite cost. Smaller apertures are less costly to manufacture and can reduce the structural mass needed to ensure the vehicle withstands harsh shocks during launch. In turn, a reduction in satellite mass allows for lighter reaction wheels to orient the vehicle, lighter motors for keeping it in orbit, and correspondingly lower launch costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0552np1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image25&quot; /&gt;

Left: A view of the target with a notional extremely large aperture. Center: 60 cm aperture (center), and with 30 cm aperture (right). Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proximity of LEO also presents several drawbacks. At these distances, the perceived motion between satellite, target, and background becomes more pronounced. This relative motion can introduce motion blur to the target picture. Sensors that take longer to collect light are more sensitive and more susceptible to motion blurring as the weapon and background move across the frame (Figure 25). Shorter collection (“integration”) times, meanwhile, can more effectively “freeze” fast-moving objects, but with a cost to sensitivity and detection range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9Dpghby.png&quot; alt=&quot;image26&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 25: Motion Blur and Jitter Effects.&lt;/strong&gt; A static hypersonic weapon-sized target, imaged from low Earth orbit, with a 35 cm aperture, appears as a blurred point source for an infrared sensor (left). Center: The same target displays motion streaking when accounting for sensor integration time: in this case, for 10 milliseconds (center). This streak becomes blurred when accounting for additional sensor vibration and jitter (right). Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitigating blur and jitter in infrared sensors involves a careful balancing act. Doing so requires FPAs with high sensitivities, readout circuits and image processors with higher data throughput, and algorithms tailored for target signatures with high relative motion. While feasible to overcome, the problem can be made easier by incorporating sensors in higher orbits or leveraging alternative phenomenologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closeness of LEO satellites also limits their coverage. Compared to satellites at higher altitudes, they possess shorter horizon-limited lines of sight and persist for less time over a given point on Earth’s surface (Figure 26). More satellites will be needed to ensure that two are continuously overhead. While it is possible to achieve infrequent coverage with a small number of satellites, it takes significant numbers to make that coverage persistent (Figures 27 and 28).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eMx8too.png&quot; alt=&quot;image28&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related consideration for LEO constellation design and cost is the higher replenishment rates required over their life cycle. Drag from the upper reaches of Earth’s atmosphere slows satellites in orbit, requiring more propulsion to maintain their station. At 600 km, the natural lifespan of a generic satellite orbit is approximately 15 years, but this falls dramatically to under one year at 400 km (Table 2). The Space Development Agency (SDA)’s Tracking Layer Tranche 0 satellites, for instance, have requirements for minimum operational lifetimes of four to five years, rather than the decades possible at higher orbits (Figure 29).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RDeKMcF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image30&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 2: Approximate Orbital Lifespan (King-Hele) of 0.01m2/kg Object with Average Solar Activity.&lt;/strong&gt; Low Earth orbit lifespans differ significantly, especially at lower altitudes, with different propulsion and station-keeping systems, satellite size, density, drag, and solar activity levels.

&lt;p&gt;Building a high replenishment cadence into a constellation’s life cycle is not entirely a disadvantage. The higher replenishment cadence of LEO constellations enables alternative philosophies to constellation design and the space industrial base. There is less need to overengineer for reliability, for instance, if a satellite’s lifespan is capped at five years. The consistent need for replenishment creates consistent demand for satellite production, keeping production lines hot, enabling economies of scale, and building a resilient defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xlFQGEG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image31&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 29: Space Development Agency Planned Constellation Life Cycle.&lt;/strong&gt; The number of satellites in orbit does not remain constant because as more are launched, others degrade. Satellites launched in FY 2024, for instance, begin to deorbit in FY 2029, causing fluctuations in the total figures. Further launches in FY 2029 and FY 2031 both expand and replenish the planned low Earth orbit constellation. Source: Space Development Agency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High replenishment rates also permit new technologies to be “spiraled in” as older satellites deorbit. Long-lived satellites are often constructed with excess capability to ensure their relevance decades in the future; shorter-lived satellites can be designed as minimum viable products, intended for replacement as technologies and requirements evolve. Increased costs — in launching more satellites and more frequently replenishing them — must be balanced against the savings associated with agile development, manufacturing at scale, and lower relative launch costs compared to higher orbits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SYSTEMIC THREATS TO PROLIFERATED LOW EARTH ORBIT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological advancements in commercial space have generated enthusiasm for pLEO constellations. In 2019, Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Michael Griffin established SDA for the express purpose of acquiring such constellations. In recent years, pLEO has become the watchword of space sensor acquisition. It embraces the notion that quantity has a quality all its own, with resilience achieved through numerical proliferation, measured both by the number of satellites currently deployed and those that could be reconstituted. An effective pLEO architecture promises to invert the cost asymmetries of traditional counterspace operations; the potential to make it more costly to destroy LEO satellites than to launch them has informed the emphasis on pLEO in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adversary counterspace capabilities, however, should not be underestimated. A pLEO architecture provides resilience to certain kinds of counterspace threats but not others (Figure 30). Indeed, putting all one’s eggs in the LEO basket may incur risks: vulnerability to systemic threats that affect the entire orbital regime. “We don’t want to become so dependent or so vulnerable, potentially, in the pLEO,” General James Dickinson of U.S. Space Command has warned, “as opposed to having a diversification, where you have capabilities and different orbital regimes [to] rely on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bmZdG83.png&quot; alt=&quot;image32&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 30: Counterspace Threats.&lt;/strong&gt; Direct-ascent anti-satellite, co-orbital, and ground site attacks all can be difficult to scale against increasingly proliferated constellation designs. Nuclear effects and cyberattacks could paralyze large segments of proliferated constellations at once. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These systemic threats — threats that exploit a failure mode common to the entire architecture — merit further consideration. Cyberattacks against a constellation’s control systems or nuclear detonations in space could disable many satellites at once. The growing density of space debris in LEO is an additional cause for concern, and one that is increasingly difficult to mitigate. Even if the cost of individual kinetic anti-satellite (ASAT) attacks exceeds the cost of launching additional LEO satellites, the debris generated from these engagements could make those orbits challenging to reconstitute. It is simpler to proliferate and reconstitute in LEO, but also potentially simpler to attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Putting all one’s eggs in the LEO basket may incur risks: vulnerability to systemic threats that affect the entire orbital regime.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks remain a persistent area threat for any distributed architecture, whether in LEO, medium Earth orbit (MEO), GEO, or highly elliptical orbit (HEO). Software to orchestrate so many satellites at once — for orbital maintenance, collision avoidance, data transport, and tasking — presents a large attack surface for potential intrusions. While difficult to characterize, cyberattacks represent a critical area threat and a major risk category for all national security satellite architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less discussed are the area threats posed by nuclear explosions in space or at high altitudes (Figure 31). Nuclear explosions cause many immediate damaging effects: the pulse of thermal, x-ray, and other radiation can damage nearby satellites and blind their sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An even greater concern, however, is nuclear pumping, a phenomenon where nuclear radiation lingers in the LEO environment (Figure 32). In LEO, Earth’s geomagnetic field would contain many of the charged particles emitted by a nuclear explosion; instead of radiating outward, these particles could spiral around the globe and damage large numbers of satellites. A 2002 Ballistic Missile Defense Organization analysis assessed that “a precursor high altitude nuclear burst could do significant damage to satellites,” with “pumped-up Van Allen belts [posing] a concern for satellite longevity” and “not well understood.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The radiation left in these belts could make it challenging to maintain and reconstitute a pLEO constellation. Indeed, while it is less costly to proliferate and reconstitute LEO constellations, more attention must be paid to these systemic threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third concern is the increasing population of satellites and debris in LEO. The growing popularity of these orbits have made it challenging to avoid collisions (Figure 33). Between December 2022 and May 2023, satellites in the commercial Starlink constellation performed over 25,000 collision-avoidance maneuvers, representing roughly half of the number of Starlink maneuvers since 2019. These debris fields could densify after a large-scale attack. Debris generated in just three ASAT missile tests account for 15 percent of tracked debris in LEO. While Starlink satellites orbit lower than planned national security LEO constellations, it is emblematic of a larger problem: growing debris fields could threaten future operations, forcing collision-avoidance maneuvers that consume fuel and disrupt coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These systemic threats could be difficult to attribute or deter. Cyberattacks generate attribution challenges that complicate potential responses. Intentional debris generation can be deniable: a debris field, generated by a foreign kinetic ASAT test, could be justified as a peacetime operation but be as disruptive to operations as a direct, unambiguous attack. Adversaries might even detonate a nuclear device over their own territory under the pretense of a test. Chinese scientific organizations have reportedly begun to reassess similar options to counter U.S. satellite constellations. Despite the damage their effects could cause, these deniable, systemic threats challenge the United States’ ability to devise a proportional response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/30PrKUT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image35&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore useful to examine other orbital regimes, including MEO and airborne domains, which could complement LEO’s advantages and help mitigate these vulnerabilities. A survivable sensor constellation would likely incorporate assets in multiple orbits, reducing the impact of such area-wide attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;medium-earth-orbit&quot;&gt;Medium Earth Orbit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Placing satellites in higher orbits can offer coverage and survivability advantages not achievable from LEO alone. Operating at higher altitudes allows each satellite to view a larger swath of Earth’s surface, reducing the numbers necessary for global coverage (Figures 34 and 35). MEO, a family of orbits between 2,000 and 35,999 km from Earth’s surface, offers several attractive design points for satellite constellations. By moving a satellite’s orbit from 1,000 to 10,000 km, for example, a satellite’s detection footprint against low-flying hypersonic targets is roughly quadrupled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IvlwUlg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image36&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 34: Satellites Needed for Geometric, Two-Satellite Global Coverage.&lt;/strong&gt; This graphic illustrates the relationship between altitude and the theoretical minimum number of satellites required for stereo coverage. Operational constellations would require considerably greater numbers of satellites at every altitude when considering sensor field of regard, solar exclusion, maintenance, and power factors. Geometric coverage minimums were derived from CSIS parametric analysis. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These substantial gains in viewable area, and the slower relative motion of these satellites across Earth’s surface, have made these orbits useful for navigational satellites, where large numbers must be in view at once. The Global Positioning System (GPS), with roughly 31 satellites in a 20,000 km orbit, allows for every point on Earth to be reachable by four or more satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MP3C6ic.png&quot; alt=&quot;image37&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEO satellites represent only a small fraction of satellites currently in orbit. This is because of the high radiation levels in the MEO environment. Earth’s geomagnetic field traps high-energy particles from the Sun and other sources, creating several belts of elevated radiation. In some scenarios, dosages in this regime can exceed 50 rad daily, a dosage equivalent to roughly 16 abdominal CT scans. This harsh operating regime introduces challenges for constellation designers. While MEO represents a large set of possible orbits, most MEO constellations operate in a smaller number of “sweet spot” altitudes and inclinations, such as at 10,000 km, where radiation is lowest (Figure 36).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KBLqXEp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image38&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 36: Radiation Fluxes on Orbit.&lt;/strong&gt; Representative orbits at 1,000 km (LEO), 10,000 km (MEO), 20,000 km (MEO), and 36,000 km (GEO). The highest fluxes are indicated by red coloration. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project with data from NASA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without hardening, these fluxes can significantly degrade a satellite’s subsystems. The interaction of solar winds and free ions in this environment can charge spacecraft components and cause unintended electrical interference. High-energy particles can degrade coatings and solar panels on the spacecraft surface and damage electronics and detector arrays within a spacecraft (Figure 37). These issues remain a concern for national security satellite constellations; unexpected radiation levels impacted availability of satellites in the Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS), for instance, which orbited at high LEO altitudes of roughly 1,350 km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iWIpReL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image39&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 37: Effects of Increased Solar Radiation on Satellite Imaging Sensor.&lt;/strong&gt; False-color image of the Sun taken by solar probe before (left) and (after) a solar radiation spike on October 28 and 29, 2003. Radiation can cause additional noise and false pixels to appear on imaging sensors, requiring specialized packaging and software to mitigate. Source: NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, radiation can disrupt a satellite’s control circuitry. Computer processors and memory degrade over time with exposure to radiation. In addition to this total-dose-induced damage, they are susceptible to single-event effects, where charged particles strike a logic gate or memory cell and change its state from one to zero (“bit flip”) or prevent it from switching altogether (“stuck bit”). These in turn can cause malfunctions or permanent damage. Mitigating this often requires dedicated circuitry and software to correct errors or specialized, radiation-hardened circuits, which are typically slower and more costly than commercial equivalents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While challenging, these environments confer some survivability benefits. Their greater distance, relative to LEO, places them out of reach of some lower-tier ASAT weapons; attacking MEO assets with a direct-ascent weapon, for instance, would take a significantly larger missile and a substantially longer time. While still vulnerable to prompt nuclear effects, the MEO environment faces relatively less of a nuclear-pumping challenge — moreover, as MEO satellites must already be hardened to withstand elevated radiation, those costs can be amortized for mitigating nuclear effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relative sparsity of the MEO environment, finally, can be conducive to monitoring co-orbital ASAT threats. Co-orbital weapons, placed into similar orbits as MEO satellites, are a common approach to kinetically attacking MEO and further orbits. With roughly 3 percent of spacecraft orbiting in MEO, it may be relatively easier to observe, distinguish, and counter suspicious behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;geosynchronous-and-highly-elliptical-orbits&quot;&gt;Geosynchronous and Highly Elliptical Orbits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geosynchronous orbits, at roughly 36,000 km from Earth, require even fewer satellites to achieve persistent coverage. At this distance, satellites orbiting the equator stay effectively stationary over a fixed point on Earth’s surface, orbiting at the same rate as Earth turns. No other orbit can provide a similar level of persistence — at the cost of placing satellites at an extreme distance. Current and forthcoming missile warning satellites, including SBIRS and Next Gen OPIR, occupy these orbits, where persistent coverage is achievable with only a small number of assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OKN1P9t.png&quot; alt=&quot;image40&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 38: Depiction of the SBIRS and DSP Architecture.&lt;/strong&gt; The Space Based Infrared System incorporates geosynchronous and highly elliptical polar satellites. GEO satellites offer latitudinal and longitudinal persistence by orbiting at the same rate that the Earth rotates. To maintain this persistence, the orbits must be close to the equator. A pair of polar satellites, meanwhile, can offer persistent coverage of at least one satellite over the poles. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satellites in highly elliptical orbits offer similar advantages, offering persistent, staring coverage near Earth’s poles. In such orbits, satellites come within several hundred kilometers of Earth before swinging far into space, often tens of thousands of kilometers away. As a HEO satellite approaches the highest point in its orbit — the apogee — its velocity slows, allowing it to “hang” over a specific region for longer than the time spent at the lowest point, the perigee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A minimum of two HEO satellites is necessary to provide continuous coverage of Earth’s high-latitude regions. When combined with equatorial GEO satellites, which offer persistence at most lower latitudes, only a few satellites become needed to provide whole-Earth coverage. The SBIRS missile warning constellation, for example, includes six GEO satellites to provide coverage of most latitudes, and two highly elliptical polar satellites to maintain custody of the North Pole and upper Northern Hemisphere (Figures 38 and 39).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/D5hdEAx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image41&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 39: SBIRS-HEO Sensor View of a Boosting Rocket.&lt;/strong&gt; Image degraded for declassification. Source: U.S. Air Force.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extreme distances of these constellations introduce novel operational considerations. Much larger apertures are needed to image targets at high resolution. As such, it becomes challenging to perform more detailed sensing missions, including midcourse and boost-phase tracking. Radio signals and light can take up to 220 milliseconds to reach the sensor of a satellite in GEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch costs for the requisite geostationary transfer orbits, moreover, are often double to triple the price of launches to LEO. GEO and polar satellites, designed with fuel to travel from such transfer orbits to their final positions, take longer to place on orbit, and often require larger structures. While fewer satellites are needed for coverage, each unit can become costly to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems in these higher orbits, however, can be more difficult to target with some ASAT weapons. It is expensive to acquire direct-ascent missiles capable of targeting systems in GEO; competitors have instead developed sophisticated co-orbital weapons capable of hiding and persisting in geosynchronous orbits. While the popularity of geosynchronous orbits makes it simpler to conceal co-orbital weapons systems, HEO systems, with their high speeds and fewer numbers, may be harder to attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;airborne-architectures&quot;&gt;Airborne Architectures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the conversation about elevated sensors has thus far revolved around space-based platforms. This emphasis is understandable and indeed necessary for achieving persistent, global coverage. But airborne platforms may also have a role to play. The United States could risk a gap in capability if space constellations do not come online as scheduled or if other problems develop. Several factors counsel an exploration of airborne sensors for missile tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airborne sensor platforms are mature and, despite their smaller coverage footprints, could generate persistent sensing capability in ways that spacecraft cannot, particularly for specific defended locations, such as the National Capital Region, Okinawa, or Guam. While limited to regional applications, airborne sensors could serve an interim system, backfilling coverage while a space constellation is deployed. Additionally, airborne sensors might serve as an underlay for space sensors, increasing coverage density in these critical regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OPPORTUNISM OR PERSISTENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to conceptualize an airborne underlay: as an opportunistic, occasional capability, and as a persistent architecture. Several aircraft in service possess a residual capability to detect and track ballistic missiles opportunistically. In Desert Storm, for example, Air Force F-15s could occasionally detect Scud missile launches during their strike missions but lacked the weapons to engage them or the endurance to patrol for extended periods of time. More recently, in 2012, an F-35 was able to detect a NASA space launch in its initial phases using onboard infrared sensors at distances of up to 1,481 km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tIWLcRJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image42&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 40: NASA ATREX Flight Even.&lt;/strong&gt; Footage from the F-35 AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System infrared sensor. During the test, an F-35 tracked several multi-stage rockets with its radar and infrared sensors. Source: Northrop Grumman.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An opportunistic approach might integrate these existing platforms into the Missile Defense System (MDS). Fifth-generation fighters, such as the F-35, have already demonstrated the ability to communicate fire control-quality tracking information to surface-based missile defenses (Figure 40). While such capabilities cannot persistently cover a defended region and may be called for other mission areas, more could be done to develop the doctrine and datalinks to weave existing sensor assets into the MDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more robust approach would be to incorporate a persistent airborne underlay for defending critical locations such as Guam. The systems needed for this mission would require long endurances and would ideally fly at higher altitudes than fighter aircraft, allowing for further lines of sight. Such aircraft, equipped with longer-range sensors, would maintain fixed orbits — or combat air patrols (CAPs) — over a position, with enough aircraft in inventory to maintain one or more aloft at any point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jO21eBb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image43&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 41: Multispectral Target System.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Missile Defense Agency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such elements have been a recurring feature of boost-phase missile defense designs but are relevant to many other missions, including hypersonic missile defense. Relevant airborne missile-tracking capabilities have already been demonstrated. Between 2015 and 2017, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) used a pair of multispectral-sensor-equipped MQ-9 uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) to track ballistic and cruise missiles (Figure 41). Flying at a 12.8 km altitude, the pair of aircraft tracked intermediate- and medium-range ballistic missiles from over 1,000 km away. An orbit of modestly persistent sensor aircraft — drones, high-altitude balloons, or others — could contribute to the defense of regional assets in concert with a space sensor system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SIZING A CONSTELLATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with space architectures, designing a persistent airborne sensor layer is an inexact art with few absolute rules. Designers must reconcile the number of aircraft required, their individual cost and performance, the locations of possible CAPs, and the bases where aircraft are stored and maintained to construct a viable system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of these considerations, an aircraft’s operating altitude is especially critical. Higher-flying systems can offer further viewing horizons against low-flying targets and other sensing and survivability advantages. Hypersonic weapons flying at 20 km will enter a 15 km-altitude aircraft’s line of sight at 950 km — roughly 65 percent farther than a ground-based sensor (Figure 42). Moreover, high altitudes offer clearer atmospheric conditions for optical transmission, potentially easing the employment of infrared and other electro-optical sensors. Aircraft flying at altitudes above 10 km may also be difficult to engage with lower-tier surface-to-air missiles, offering survivability advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CTiGXhk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image44&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 42: Detection Ranges of Surface and Airborne Sensors.&lt;/strong&gt; Surface-based sensors (left) cannot detect low-flying targets at longer distances. Elevating the sensor altitude from sea level to a 15 km-altitude aircraft (right) allows for substantially increased viewable distance. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An equally important consideration is aircraft endurance. Long-endurance aircraft are critical to minimize the fleet size and other associated costs needed to maintain a CAP. High-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) aircraft, such as the RQ-4, and medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) aircraft, such as the MQ-9B, can offer endurances of over 24 hours, increasing the time spent on station or reducing requirements for aerial refueling. Prior analyses have estimated that roughly 3 to 4 MQ-9B aircraft could maintain a persistent CAP, with a force-level quantity of up to 17, including spares, needed to maintain three continuous CAPs for up to 270 days per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fleet size requirements are also affected by the location of airbases relative to CAP locations. The further the CAP is from an airbase, the longer each aircraft must spend transiting to the patrol region, reducing the fuel available to be on station. Transit time can dramatically increase the numbers required to maintain persistent coverage, holding other factors equal. Achieving the smallest fleet possible will require permissive basing and overflight requirements to minimize the flyout distances needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-the-right-mix&quot;&gt;Finding the Right Mix&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense is currently moving toward a multi-orbit architecture in LEO, MEO, GEO, and HEO. These developments acknowledge how efficiencies in some orbits offset inefficiencies in another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEO constellations benefit from proliferation and economies of scale but suffer challenges with persistence, orbital lifespan, and relative motion. MEO constellations offer more coverage and persistence but require potentially costlier satellites with larger apertures and radiation-hardened subsystems. GEO and HEO satellites provide unique coverage characteristics, requiring few satellites to selectively cover a given pole or longitude, but generate high unit costs and stringent reliability requirements. Airborne sensors can generate persistence unbounded by spacecraft orbital mechanics but have smaller detection footprints and require appropriate basing locations to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The models depicted herein highlight these tradeoffs and the possible benefits of leveraging hybrid architectures — constellations with multiple orbital altitudes. LEO constellations in efficient, highly inclined orbits, for example, tend to under-cover areas near the equator, including critical parts of the Indo-Pacific region. MEO assets, orbiting about the equator, could usefully complement these configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A constellation designed for equatorial and mid-latitude coverage, by contrast, might be supplemented with HEO assets that could selectively cover the poles. A combination of assets in different orbital bands, with their different levels of relative motion and viewing angles, might ease the challenge of tracking hypersonic and ballistic targets, whose thermal signatures vary significantly based on background and sensor viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configurations combining multiple orbital altitudes can add resilience and scale without dramatically increasing the number of orbital planes necessary. These models are illustrative: they do not depict ideal constellation designs, nor do they depict the redundancies needed for survivability. They rather demonstrate how orbits could be mixed to cover priority regions more efficiently. As acknowledged by Michael Griffin, former undersecretary of defense for research and engineering and a leading proponent of proliferated low Earth orbit constellations, an effective architecture should be “as widely distributed [as possible] over many choices of orbital regimes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ADDRESSING LEO INDO-PACIFIC COVERAGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high-inclination LEO constellation optimized for global coverage will produce the least coverage in latitudes near the equator. These latitudes, however, are most relevant for the Indo-Pacific theater. It is often more costly to add additional orbital planes (rings) than it is to add more satellites to a given orbital plane, as this requires separate launches to take place. One approach to enhance coverage of these latitudes could be to add a single equatorial orbital plane with eight satellites, at MEO (10,000 km) (Figure 43).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LGPt5oi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image45&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second illustrative design, with 36 LEO satellites and a single, 8-satellite MEO plane, puts this principle in sharper relief (Figure 44). MEO satellites are used exclusively to provide coverage to mid-latitudes, while a highly inclined LEO constellation provides persistent coverage of the higher latitudes and poles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SELECTIVE POLAR COVERAGE WITH HIGHLY ELLIPTICAL ORBIT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HEO satellites offer the unique ability to selectively cover a single pole; as most threats transit the Northern Hemisphere, it allows constellation designs that do not “waste” coverage. A constellation of four HEO satellites can provide persistent stereo coverage of the polar regions, useful for missile warning. A mixed constellation of eight MEO satellites in an equatorial orbit and four HEO satellites illustrates this selective coverage capability (Figure 45).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5KhEKdo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image47&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;COMBINING LAYERS FOR RESILIENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid constellations can combine their coverage hotspots to increase emphasis on critical regions. A LEO constellation with lower inclinations can provide dense coverage of the Indo-Pacific region, while a smaller constellation of MEO and HEO assets can provide an additional layer of resilience and selective emphasis on the poles (Figure 46). Meanwhile, a dense constellation, combining a polar-region-heavy LEO constellation and an Indo-Pacific-weighted MEO constellation, achieves robust, uniform coverage with 165 satellites (Figure 47).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;schedule-tradeoffs&quot;&gt;Schedule Tradeoffs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No single orbit presents an ideal set of launch costs, satellite configurations, and coverage for missile tracking and fire control. A sensor architecture design must optimize a large collection of intersecting variables, including sensor field of regard (FOR), altitude, inclination, and satellite unit cost, among others. Most attention has been paid to optimizing these elements to minimize the number of satellites needed for coverage, but there are other goals to consider. An architecture must also be optimized to meet useful schedules and to phase capability in ways relevant to the threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Program schedule and capability phasing should receive more consideration in current acquisition efforts. Choices over orbital configurations not only affect final sensor coverage but how coverage develops over time. Two constellation designs that eventually produce identical coverage may not necessarily generate capability along the same timelines (Figure 48).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, capability may not come online in smooth or continuous increments. Many low Earth orbit (LEO) constellation designs, for instance, leverage multiple orbital planes with high inclinations — inclinations close to the poles — to provide regional and later, global coverage. These designs are optimized to minimize the number of satellites necessary for coverage and do not provide persistent coverage of lower latitudes until all orbital planes are deployed (Figures 49, 50, and 51). Notably, the Space Development Agency (SDA)’s early Tranche 0 and Tranche 1 LEO constellations are configured with high-inclination orbits. The cost of these high inclinations to capability phasing is not always made explicit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/l2Ej1v9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 48: Alternative Capability Phasing.&lt;/strong&gt; Two space-based architectures (“A” and “B”) may deliver identical capability when completed but phase this capability on different timelines. Architecture B generates partial capability later but full capability earlier. These tradeoffs should be considered when contemplating two otherwise identical architectures. They should also impact considerations for secondary constellations or airborne underlays to fill gaps in capability phasing. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Choices over orbital configurations not only affect final sensor coverage but how coverage develops over time.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, the structure of a constellation has implications for program schedule. LEO constellations of high-inclination satellites are efficient for generating global coverage with the fewest satellites. Other architectures, however, might generate persistent regional coverage sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has been said about the need for resilience against attack, or what is called “graceful degradation.” Less attention has been given to optimizing for “graceful deployment.” A constellation optimized purely for coverage efficiencies may well deliver capability unevenly, with relevant, persistent coverage only arriving near completion. Such a glidepath is arguably in tension with the incremental, spiral-development-focused philosophy of proliferated low Earth orbit constellation deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

Persistent equatorial coverage only emerges after the number of satellites is more than tripled. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the need to mitigate technical and security risks to a future constellation, capability phasing is a critical consideration for program-level risk. It is impossible to predict future supply chain bottlenecks, changes in budgetary priorities, or other factors that could hobble a constellation’s deployment. As such, architecture designs should be resilient to the risk of premature budget reductions or cancellation. Some constellation designs will not generate persistent coverage of meaningful regions should deployment be canceled halfway (Figure 52). It thus becomes crucial to consider which designs would offer meaningful coverage even when partially deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A constellation optimized for graceful deployment may entail the selection of alternative configurations and may require more satellites to achieve coverage. Such costs are nevertheless worth considering (Figure 52). A constellation optimized solely for long-term efficiencies incurs short-term risks. In addition to programmatic risks, they can tempt adversaries to accelerate the development of countermeasures, knowing that capability will only arrive at once at a single future maturation point. Partial capability can and should arrive earlier. Multiple avenues — lower-inclination orbits, regional airborne sensors, and others — exist for realizing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/r5QlqNx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image54&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 52: Combining Constellations.&lt;/strong&gt; Realizing global geometric coverage in two steps (right, center) can entail more satellites (40+26) than a constellation optimized for global coverage (49) (left). Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One avenue to graceful deployment could involve separating constellation deployment into multiple steps. For example, a LEO constellation could be designed as a hybrid architecture, deploying a low-inclination set of 70 satellites for regional coverage (Figure 53) before expanding to global coverage with a second set of 36 highly inclined sensors (Figure 54). While this could entail more satellites than higher-inclination alternatives, it delivers increments of coverage in two steps, achieving regional coverage much sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yrR67It.png&quot; alt=&quot;image55&quot; /&gt;

Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another method may be to deploy underlays, such as aircraft-based sensors, to backfill capability until a space constellation is deployed. Regardless of approach, there are many possible levers for smoothing capability deployment. Careful selection of phased constellations, or the deployment of airborne underlays and other assets, could produce coverage of relevant areas in shorter increments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schedule and capability phasing deserve to be key factors in assessing this trade space. Recent requests presented by SDA imply increased attention to these problems. In a recent solicitation for new Tracking Layer LEO satellites, for instance, SDA requested potential solutions for constellations including mixes of higher and lower inclinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A design that deploys gracefully could offer useful capability even when incomplete. One that does not deploy gracefully will not deliver such benefits, despite any promise of future numerical efficiencies. If a geopolitical crisis occurs in the late 2020s, the United States will have to fight with the space sensor constellation that is fielded, not the complete architecture planned in the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-emerging-architecture&quot;&gt;An Emerging Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These many sensor, orbital, and schedule tradeoffs are at play in the Department of Defense (DoD)’s ongoing space sensor acquisition effort. This chapter reviews the envisioned missions, programs, and budgets of the forthcoming architecture and considers what questions remain unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fiscal year (FY) 2023, the DoD invested nearly $5 billion into acquiring overhead sensors for missile warning, tracking, and fire control (Figure 55). These efforts have been partly centralized under the Space Force organizational structure, with multiple programs of record underway for low (LEO), medium (MEO), geosynchronous (GEO), and highly elliptical (HEO) orbit sensor layers (Table 3). Under its Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) initiative, the Space Force will deploy two GEO (Next Generation GEO) and two HEO (Next Generation Polar) satellites, supplementing its Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) constellation for missile warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second effort, designated Resilient Missile Warning/Missile Tracking (RMW/MT), will incorporate a constellation of nine or more MEO satellites (RMW/MT-MEO) and a larger constellation of LEO satellites (RMW/MT-LEO) to perform both missile warning and missile tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CUeP7As.png&quot; alt=&quot;image57&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel with the RMW/MT-LEO program, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has developed a prototype sensor, the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS), capable of furnishing the “highly sensitive, low-latency, high quality of service” data needed for the more demanding missile defense fire control mission. The program will launch two prototype LEO satellites in late 2023, after which “responsibility for HBTSS operational fielding will be transferred to the US Space Force.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For FY 2024, the Space Force requested $2.6 billion for Next Generation OPIR, including $720 million for Next Generation GEO, $1 billion for Next Generation Polar, $661 million for associated ground systems, $191 million for modernization initiatives, and $31 million for integration. Additionally, it requested $2.2 billion for RMW/MT, including $1.2 billion for its LEO constellation, $538 million for its MEO constellation, and $506 million for its associated ground systems. For HBTSS, MDA requested $69 million, with minimal funding planned after FY 2026 when program responsibility is transferred to the Space Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These newer investments represent a welcome shift in resources. In FY 2023, funding for missile warning, represented by the Next Generation OPIR portfolio, dwarfed investments in missile tracking, represented by RMW/MT (Figure 56). The DoD’s FY 2024 budget request, by contrast, dramatically expands investments in the LEO and MEO constellations needed for missile tracking while cutting Next Generation GEO, reducing its planned satellite purchases from three to two. With its cancellation of the seventh and eighth SBIRS and the third Next Generation OPIR satellites, the Space Force is pivoting away from an approach centered around geosynchronous missile warning satellites to one dominated by large constellations of missile tracking satellites in LEO and MEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;next-generation-opir&quot;&gt;Next Generation OPIR&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next Generation OPIR, including its Next Generation GEO and Polar components, formerly represented the largest segment of the DoD’s space sensing portfolio (Figure 57). Beyond recapitalizing space-based missile warning, whose associated SBIRS and Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites entered service decades ago, these satellites will offer enhanced capabilities, tracking dimmer targets over wider areas. Combined with SBIRS, these satellites will be capable of detecting the hot plumes of missile launches, cueing relevant sensors, and informing national command authorities. They will supply data to critical interfaces, including the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) Overhead Persistent Infrared Architecture (BOA) and Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA), a U.S. strategic nuclear warning system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2018 and 2021, the Space Force awarded $7.8 billion in contracts for the development and production of three Next Generation GEO satellites, with initial launches scheduled for 2025. Following a reorientation of priorities in late 2022, the Space Force plans to cut one Next Generation GEO satellite, launching the first in FY 2025 and the second in FY 2027. In FY 2024, the Space Force requested $719 million for the program, a considerable reduction from the $1.7 billion requested in FY 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of two Next Generation Polar satellites, meanwhile, is scheduled for launch by FY 2028. These satellites, orbiting at higher inclinations, would provide continuous coverage of the Northern Hemisphere and North Pole, supplementing the two SBIRS-HEO satellites presently in orbit. The Space Force requested $1 billion for the program in FY 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These satellites will pass sensor data to users through a new set of ground infrastructure, funded at $582 million in FY 2023. The Next Generation OPIR Ground component will incorporate the Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution (FORGE), a system of software, ground terminals, and computers for mission management, data processing, telemetry, and command and control. Various components of FORGE are expected to come online through the late 2020s, with development for Next Generation GEO and Polar continuing through FY 2028. These efforts come in parallel with the Space Force’s Enterprise Ground System (EGS), a broader modernization of the organization’s ground systems software, and the Next Generation OPIR Interim Operations (NIO), a backup program to prevent FORGE delays from impacting Next Generation GEO launch schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resilient-missile-warningmissile-tracking--low-earth-orbit-proliferated-warfighter-space-architecture&quot;&gt;Resilient Missile Warning/Missile Tracking – Low Earth Orbit (Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RMW/MT program consolidates past efforts to develop a large constellation of LEO satellites and a smaller constellation of MEO satellites for missile tracking (Figure 58). As of 2023, this constellation would combine up to “135 LEO and 16 Space Force-developed MEO satellites working in concert through an integrated ground solution.” In 2023, Space Systems Command (SSC) was designated as the “lead end-to-end systems integrator” for the constellation. DoD then created a combined program office with SSC, the Space Development Agency (SDA), and MDA. It is likely that the architecture’s final configuration will change as prototype systems enter orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RMW/MT’s LEO component consists of SDA’s Tracking Layer constellation, which aims to launch successive phases, called “tranches,” of LEO sensor satellites in two-year increments. The acquisition philosophy for the Tracking Layer apparently differs from past military space efforts; it is intended to demonstrate capability on commercial timelines and exploit commercial components and design philosophies, rather than fitting a traditional requirements generation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SDA plans to acquire the Tracking Layer and a larger constellation of LEO communications and sensing satellites, the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA; formerly the National Defense Space Architecture, or NDSA), using this approach. The PWSA constellation will initially include four tranches of LEO satellites, labeled Tranches 0, 1, 2, and 3. Tranche 0 will include 20 Transport Layer satellites and eight Tracking Layer satellites, which host wide-field-of-view (WFOV) infrared sensors and orbit approximately 1,000 km from Earth (Figure 59). SDA launched the first 10 of its Tranche 0 satellites in April 2023, and the second launch concluded in September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plans to develop the Tracking Layer have shifted as Space Force and SDA budgets and priorities evolve. A second tranche, Tranche 1, is scheduled to launch in 2025 and would include 39 satellites (35 tracking, 4 fire control) orbiting at 1,000 km in five polar orbital planes (Figure 60). When combined with the Tranche 0 Tracking Layer, these satellites would offer a “kernel” of global coverage to warfighters by late 2025. The constellation initially consisted of four orbital planes with seven Tracking Layer satellites each; a $250 million congressional add, approved in 2023, added a fifth plane “to increase global Missile Warning and Missile Tracking coverage in support of combatant commands to include INDOPACOM.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional tranches would launch in 2027 and beyond. Tranche 2 would add 54 or more satellites (48 tracking, 6 fire control) to provide “global, persistent” missile warning and missile tracking while demonstrating a limited fire control capability (Figures 61, 62, and 63). Unlike prior tranches, it would deploy three orbital planes to a higher inclination and three orbital planes to a lower inclination suited for Indo-Pacific regional coverage. Each plane would have nine satellites; eight with WFOV missile warning/missile tracking sensors and one with a missile defense-focused “Fire Control quality sensor.” The first plane would enter orbit in April 2027, and deployment would conclude by November 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project with data from the Space Development Agency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tranche 3 and beyond would increase the PWSA Tracking Layer’s density past 135 assets and incorporate newer satellite technologies. Given the intended five-year orbital lifespan of each satellite, these would expand upon and replace earlier tranches, enabling another set of technology insertions. While SDA has already defined requirements for earlier tranches, the eventual configuration of additions beyond Tranche 3 may vary considerably as satellites are put on orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resilient-missile-warningmissile-tracking--medium-earth-orbit&quot;&gt;Resilient Missile Warning/Missile Tracking – Medium Earth Orbit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an initial push and pull between LEO- or MEO-only approaches, the Space Force has embarked on efforts to deploy a mixed constellation of LEO and MEO missile tracking satellites. The second leg of this mixed constellation, RMW/MT-MEO, will complement the LEO Tracking Layer with additional satellites in MEO. This attention to MEO represents an important philosophical shift toward hybrid architectures, with MEO particularly useful for assuring coverage of lower latitudes (Figures 44 and 45).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In FY 2023, the Space Force expanded an exploratory effort to prototype MEO tracking satellites, MEO Track Custody (MTC), into a full-scale acquisition program integrated with the RMW/MT constellation. RMW/MT-MEO would acquire nine or more MEO satellites, at two orbital altitudes, to “pivot the Department of the Air Force’s (DAF) legacy missile warning force design to a more resilient multi-orbit approach.” In FY 2023, Congress appropriated $409 million toward the program — more than double the $139 million budget request. In FY 2024, the Space Force requested $538 million to support the accelerated MEO effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VDzEIGd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image67&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 64: SSC MEO Roadmap.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: U.S. Space Systems Command.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like SDA’s successive “tranches,” SSC will deploy MEO capabilities in a series of increments called “epochs.” Epoch 1, deploying in late 2026, will include satellites at two altitudes: a plane of six vehicles at a lower orbital altitude and three at a higher one. Successive epochs will likely include 18 or more satellites, with a possible total of 34 to 44 satellites when complete. By the launch of Epoch 3, the constellation will reportedly deliver persistent missile tracking coverage. These MEO satellites will leverage research performed under the earlier MTC effort, which by May 2021 had awarded early contracts for digital satellite prototypes. Program design review for one Epoch 1 satellite concluded in July 2023, and critical design review completed in November 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift toward a LEO/MEO mixed constellation in FY 2024 follows significant congressional scrutiny. In July 2022, the House Armed Services Committee directed the chief of space operations to brief the committee on including “free, fair, and open competition within [the Space Force’s] acquisition plan” by January 2023. Following a $130 million congressional plus-up, the program office also moved to add the “third plane of Epoch 1 spacecraft . . . add[ing] additional acceleration funds in FY 2024 to . . . aggressively pursue additional Epoch 1 capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hypersonic-and-ballistic-tracking-space-sensor&quot;&gt;Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among these several programs, HBTSS represents the DoD’s current effort to enable the fire control-quality tracking mission. HBTSS occupies a critical function in the forthcoming sensor ecosystem, aimed at providing the high-fidelity, low-latency tracking information needed to guide missile defense interceptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDA currently retains acquisition authority for HBTSS prototyping. Under the current timeline, MDA will prototype and launch a medium-field-of-view sensor to demonstrate fire control-quality tracking of hypersonic weapons. MDA began prototyping the sensor in 2018 and intends to launch two HBTSS-equipped satellite testbeds into orbit in late 2023 or early 2024. Following on-orbit test activities, “responsibility for HBTSS operational fielding will be transferred to the US Space Force and the MDA will continue the development of the next generation of space-based fire control sensors for missile defense.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prototypes will be placed in orbits intended to “track test events in the INDOPACOM region” and would likely leverage a commercially supplied chassis, or bus, to host the HBTSS sensor. In 2021, Congress directed MDA to “achieve full operational employment” of the system by December 2023. On-orbit test activities are scheduled to continue through 2025, including support for Aegis and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) intercept tests in 2024 and 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear, however, how many HBTSS or HBTSS-derived payloads will eventually be fitted to SDA’s Tracking Layer constellation. While MDA requested $68 million for the program in FY 2023, funding is expected to decline after demonstration activities conclude and responsibility for fire control transfers to SSC and SDA. Following this transition, SDA aims to launch four HBTSS-derived sensor payloads as part of its Tranche 1 activities and an additional six fire control sensors in Tranche 2. Further developmental spirals, the priority accorded to the hypersonic defense mission, and SDA’s responsibilities for supporting missile defense, however, have not yet been publicly defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;seeking-alignment&quot;&gt;Seeking Alignment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several recent developments have been promising. The DoD has increasingly pivoted from an exclusively pLEO design to a mixed-orbit architecture with complementary LEO and MEO components. In contrast with earlier tranches, SDA’s Tranche 2 will now include assets at lower inclinations suited for earlier Indo-Pacific-region coverage. Moreover, the Space Force has signaled further investments in deploying fire control sensors on orbit, both in SDA Tranches 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions nevertheless remain over the configuration, schedule, and mission of the forthcoming architecture. It remains uncertain how effectively MDA fire control efforts will transition to SDA’s architecture and how the planned numbers of fire control satellites in PWSA support requirements for hypersonic defense. While Tranche 2 plans include three orbital planes at lower inclinations, it is uncertain how this could be expanded to assure persistent Indo-Pacific stereo coverage. Other questions — over what mix of LEO and MEO assets is optimal, how to phase deployments to cover the Indo-Pacific, what software is necessary to fuse information from so many sensors, and how to align ground systems acquisition with the fielding of satellites — are not yet resolved. The DoD has reached substantial technical milestones and pioneered innovative approaches to acquiring these systems. As one analyst has remarked, however, “there seems to be a lack of consensus on how quickly, and in what manner,” to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-temptations&quot;&gt;Three Temptations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both on Capitol Hill and in the Pentagon, senior leaders have expressed the need to accelerate the fielding of sensors for hypersonic and ballistic missile defense. Doing so will require optimizing an entire system of systems — effectors; sensors; command, control, and communications systems; and the software that weaves them together. The greater challenge is not in constructing these individual parts but in aligning their deployment to deliver capability on relevant timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing the necessary architecture will require attention to potential policy temptations and pitfalls. Policymakers may face temptations to abdicate the fire control mission, overoptimize for numerical efficiencies, or consolidate to single orbital regimes in the pursuit of savings and simplicity. Succumbing to these temptations would come at the cost of speed and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;temptation-to-abdicate&quot;&gt;Temptation to Abdicate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One temptation to avoid is to abdicate the missile defense fire control mission. While technically challenging, fire control-quality tracking is needed for hypersonic missile defense. As responsibility for fire control transfers from the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to the Space Force, it could be tempting to postpone or deemphasize these difficult requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, fire control should not be redefined as a reach goal. Combatant commands central to missile defense, including U.S. Space Command, have recognized the necessity of fire control and “strongly endorsed continuing work on systems such as . . . the MDA’s Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor.” Congress, moreover, had funded the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS) and repeatedly kept it within MDA explicitly to ensure schedule discipline and applicability to missile defense. Whether or not HBTSS represents the eventual solution, fire control requirements should remain a defining feature of sensor architecture design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing fire control requirements will be difficult but not impossible. “The ability to detect and track dim targets in a cluttered background . . . with the sensitivity necessary to support the [counter-] hypersonic kill chain” requires considerable investment to achieve. The mission demands low latencies and small pixel footprints, achievable either through dedicated medium-field-of-view (MFOV) systems cued by wide-field-of-view (WFOV) tracking sensors or high-resolution, fire control-capable WFOV sensors, pending the supply of larger-format focal planes. An ideal constellation might feature both, with responsive WFOV fire control sensors and an additional MFOV layer for tracking challenging targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Fire control should not be redefined as a reach goal.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SDA’s commitments to deploying fire control sensors represent an important step in the right direction. Despite earlier uncertainties over their prioritization, recent plans suggest that SDA will deploy six fire control sensors in the Tranche 2 constellation, after MDA’s two-satellite HBTSS demonstration activities conclude. The relation of Tranche 2 fire control sensors to HBTSS remains publicly unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of fire control tracking satellites planned, however, remains inadequate for providing persistent coverage, and the glidepath to transition from an HBTSS-based approach to a future fire control system appears uncertain. The six SDA fire control satellites planned to launch in 2027, for instance, will be valuable for demonstrating capability but insufficient for achieving persistent Indo-Pacific coverage. It is worth considering whether these efforts could be expanded; additional satellites at these inclinations could generate persistent coverage of the Indo-Pacific. Additional mid-inclination satellites would bolster deterrent capability in a critical period, coinciding with Beijing’s timeline to develop a Taiwan invasion capability by 2027. Even if such threats are delayed, these additional satellites could be held in reserve to reconstitute constellations as they deorbit or come under attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers are right to question if the current approach is enough to support fire control for hypersonic and ballistic missile defense. While the Space Force has committed to “the development and demonstration of space technologies to deliver Missile Warning, Missile Tracking, and Missile Defense (MW/MT/MD) capabilities including advanced missile tracking and fire control,” it must go further to operationalize them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the previous, near-complete focus on proliferated low Earth orbit (LEO) sensors is worth reconsideration. Space Force efforts to explore fire control tracking from medium Earth orbit (MEO) sensors merit further study and potential acceleration. As discussed above, the MEO regime offers useful survivability, coverage, and schedule benefits, and deploying a MEO-based fire control layer could add useful resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transfer of fire control tracking sensor programs from MDA to SDA represents an exercise in institutional trust. It will also be a test of recognizing the central relation between space and the future missile defense enterprise. Continued oversight will be essential, to ensure both that this transition effectively takes place and that fire control capability is achieved on schedule and at the necessary scale. It will require clear, high-level commitments from Pentagon leadership to allow these capabilities to cross the valley of death (Figure 65).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;temptation-to-overoptimize&quot;&gt;Temptation to Overoptimize&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second set of policy temptations threatens deployment schedules. Fielding new technologies requires experimentation. It is difficult to fully characterize sensor performance without placing them on orbit; spiral development approaches, such as those employed by SDA, can enable the continual experimentation needed to refine these systems. Even when operationalized, an architecture should continue to evolve. A mantra from the Aegis community is to “build a little, test a little, learn a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experimentation must be connected to results. The future architecture must prioritize coverage of the lower latitudes for the Indo-Pacific region. This is not only a matter of scaling constellation sizes but of selecting a design that addresses priority regions earlier. It may be tempting to continue experimenting: to deploy endless technology demonstrations to design constellations optimized for global coverage on an ever-longer timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three means to resist this temptation include designing constellations for graceful deployment, leveraging airborne underlays, and accelerating ground and data infrastructure development. The treasure obligated for these development efforts could be in vain if capability arrives late to need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DEPLOY GRACEFULLY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deployment phasing should define every requirement in a potential constellation. The forthcoming sensor architecture must prioritize persistent coverage of the Indo-Pacific region first and do so sooner. Amid theoretical debates over orbital planes, satellites, and coverage, it is important to ask when an architecture could generate persistent coverage of relevant regions, and when this might expand to global coverage. As emphasized previously, even if the final capabilities of two designs are identical, the way these capabilities phase in — how they deploy gracefully and which regions receive denser coverage — can differ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These considerations should impact the orbital design of forthcoming constellations. High-inclination configurations, optimized for maximizing coverage efficiencies once fully populated, may generate minimal relevant coverage when only partially populated. The recent nods to lower-inclination orbits in Tranche 2 are an important step to moderate polar over-coverage. It is worth asking if it is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AN AIRBORNE UNDERLAY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, it will be crucial to examine alternatives for accelerating Indo-Pacific sensor coverage. A high-inclination LEO constellation will not generate persistent regional coverage for some time. But the immediate future fight is likely to be a regional fight (Figure 66). Airborne sensors might be useful for nearer-term regional tracking capability, defending critical assets including Okinawa or Guam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Schedule is king. The train is going to leave the station on time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such approaches have been shown to be operationally viable. Architectures based on uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) have already been proposed for persistent, regional boost-phase missile defense missions, leveraging similar sensors needed for hypersonic tracking. MDA has previously demonstrated infrared missile tracking sensors on UAS, successfully tracking ballistic missiles in flight. In 2016 and 2021, the Navy and Army successfully integrated fighter-derived tracking information into missile defense tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DoD has already begun to use decommissioned RQ-4 drones to track hypersonic systems in flight tests. There is an even larger stock of existing UAS, slated for divestment, which could be leveraged. Many pieces of the puzzle are already in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, advances in airborne platform endurance, networking, stealth, and autonomy could enable alternative designs. Opportunistic missile tracking could be invigorated by multimission platforms tightly linked to missile defense fire control networks. New domain awareness systems could allow asset placements closer to suspected missile launch sites. Significant investments in lighter-than-air and ultra-long-endurance aircraft, combined with declines in infrared sensor size, weight, and power, could allow a proliferated architecture of smaller, lighter, and cheaper airborne sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airborne systems offer different characteristics — flexibility, proximity, and survivability — to backstop and enhance a space-based missile tracking architecture. Introducing opportunistic or persistent airborne sensors increases the complexity of the missile defense problem for an adversary, forcing them to consider multiple domains from which their missiles could be tracked and engaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JZTNXyP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image70&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 67: Airborne Sensors near Guam.&lt;/strong&gt; A notional laydown of airborne sensors defending Guam, involving two surface-based sensor assets and three long-endurance UAS — two in a combat air patrol, and one transiting to replenish the orbit. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, these architectures are not without their limitations. Their comparatively low altitudes constrain their lines of sight compared to spacecraft and, like space architectures, would require fleets of multiple systems to achieve persistence. They are not invulnerable — both aircraft and their airbases can be attacked by aircraft, missiles, and drones if placed close enough to threat regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the DoD races ahead with space sensor acquisition, it is worth considering the roles airborne sensors might play in accelerating capability delivery to the Indo-Pacific (Figure 67). Persistent airborne sensors might relax schedule pressure on space systems and allow for designs that phase capability later. More critically, a diversity of assets in space and in the air — in different orbits and with different mixes of penetrating capability and persistence — generates more dilemmas for adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;REDUCING INTEGRATION RISKS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phasing capability earlier also demands more attention to the systems that allow them to interoperate. A constellation design will live and die by its data transport and integration. If history is any indication, the delivery of software and ground systems will be difficult, costly, and late. “What you don’t want to have,” General James Dickinson of U.S. Space Command warns, “is where you have outdated ground stations that can’t leverage the new capabilities on orbit.” The development of these systems was a substantial contributor to the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) program’s early cost and schedule overruns; it is likely that ground system development, especially related to sensor fusion, will only mature after satellites have reached orbit. Both Congress and the DoD have roles to play in mitigating this risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fusing sensor outputs from air and space platforms in multiple orbital bands is no easy undertaking. Efforts to develop common ground systems for the forthcoming Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) and Resilient Missile Warning/Missile Tracking (RMW/MT) constellations, for example, face considerable technical and schedule risk. A viable sensor fusion solution must correlate information from multiple sensors with different look angles, latencies, and uncertainties associated with their sensor returns to form a track. While some portion of this processing can be done on board satellites — “on the edge” — significant track correlation and fusion will likely initially take place on the ground (Figure 68).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A constellation design will live and die by its data transport and integration.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 2023, the DoD plans to manage the ground operations for RMW/MT through a combined program office including Space Systems Command (SSC), which will acquire the MEO component; SDA, which will acquire the Tracking Layer; and MDA, which retains considerable equities through HBTSS and the Missile Defense System (MDS). The ground components for each system are under development by different contractors and must interface with satellites from many vendors. Their software must correctly interface with the Next Generation OPIR Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution (FORGE) infrastructure and be compliant with the broader Space Force Enterprise Ground System (EGS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still in its initial iterations, RMW/MT and Next Generation OPIR constellations will leverage different data formats, requiring “translation” on the ground to be interoperable. The RMW/MT ground segment itself involves separate infrastructure for the LEO Tracking Layer, MEO constellation, and HBTSS, which come online on different timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timelines for acquiring these translation capabilities will be tight. FORGE itself is expected to come online no earlier than 2025. A more comprehensive ability to command and control multiple types of satellites with a single protocol, EGS, is required to enter service before 2028. Responsibility for ensuring an integrated space architecture — such as by mandating common data standards and software development practices — has been dispersed across multiple program elements and offices. Despite clear road maps for launching large volumes of new satellites, no comprehensive plans have been publicized for fusing their large volumes of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DoD has only recently begun algorithm development to fuse two-dimensional sensor tracks from OPIR satellites. While it has demonstrated the performance of its sensors on the ground, sensor track fusion remains a substantial software challenge. As deployment of the Tranche 0 satellite constellation continues, the DoD must ensure that the sensor fusion approaches it leverages are scalable to larger quantities of satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rppd0Jr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image71&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 68: Data Transport Pathways.&lt;/strong&gt; Data transport, fusion, and integration will be as important to space-based missile tracking as the sensors themselves. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be imperative to get ahead of these integration problems. How many hops must the data take between sensors, ground stations, and other data processing nodes? How long might each hop take? Which nodes will process the tracking data, which will fuse them, and which will deliver the finalized track to an effector? The various types and orbits of satellites being purchased should output common data formats that are usable across various ground assets. Moreover, the DoD should take steps to mitigate cases where fusion-related program elements lack clear organizational ownership — a substantial contributor to past schedule overruns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pace of the threat, and the pace of ongoing launch schedules, is too fast to accommodate any potential delays in sensor fusion and ground system development. Moreover, the DoD cannot settle for uncertain assurances that, someday, satellites in different orbits and with different datalinks could be integrated down the road. It will not be enough to continually experiment with fusion approaches once the satellites reach orbit. To deploy a diverse, proliferated constellation, it is essential for the ground systems and software to arrive on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;temptation-to-consolidate&quot;&gt;Temptation to Consolidate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the future sensor architecture must be designed for conflict: it must be capable of surviving and reconstituting in highly contested environments. Achieving this will require an orbitally diverse constellation design that forces adversaries to develop many types of countermeasures. Policymakers should resist temptations to consolidate the sensor architecture into a single orbital regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multi-orbit capabilities are not duplicative. An architecture in multiple orbits and altitudes can generate unique efficiencies in coverage unachievable with single-altitude architectures — especially for the Indo-Pacific region. Moreover, it will be critical to deploy diverse orbits to ensure resilience against growing counterspace threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid future programmatic and budgetary pressures, it may be tempting to consolidate a sensor architecture to a single set of orbits in the low, medium, geosynchronous, or highly elliptical domains. In the past, the DoD has overly consolidated certain capabilities in a single orbital domain, such as GEO. That practice should not be repeated. The DoD’s pivot toward a multi-altitude sensor architecture is an important step in resisting this temptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What we’re finding is that resilience has no end state.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orbital diversity has become especially critical in view of the growing counterspace threat. Adversaries recognize the importance of space sensor architectures and are rapidly advancing their counterspace capabilities. In the past five years, they have conducted over 70 counterspace and anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon tests, developmental demonstrations, and deployments (Figure 69). They are developing kinetic direct-ascent and co-orbital ASAT weapons, non-kinetic dazzlers, jammers, and cyberweapons, and have magnified natural threats to satellites, generating space debris through weapons testing. The increasing complexity of these threatens to outpace the United States’ acquisition of satellite constellations. This should be a central consideration not only in the construction of satellites, but in the design of an architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EabU1NB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image72&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different orbital regimes are vulnerable to different threat profiles. The LEO environment is easier to threaten but also easier to proliferate and reconstitute. MEO offers coverage and distance but with harsh radiation environments and challenging unit economics. GEO, meanwhile, is increasingly populated with adversary co-orbital capabilities but benefit from both distance and potential defensive capabilities — making them far from “juicy targets.” HEO regimes incorporate few assets but can be challenging to covertly engage with co-orbital weapons. No specific constellation design represents an ideal survivability profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A survivable constellation should therefore seek to multiply adversary dilemmas, forcing them to attack multiple orbital layers with multiple, costly means of attack. Assuring coverage will demand the use of air and space assets, the reconstitution of constellations under attack, and carefully planned defensive operations (Figure 70). It should leverage multiple approaches to resilience (Table 4). It is not merely a matter of proliferating sensors, but of doing so in ways that introduce additional targeting challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Rl7Bxjk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image73&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 4: Approaches to Resilience.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project with data from the Department of Defense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different orbits are suited to different resilience pathways. Constellations optimized for smaller numbers of assets — in GEO, for instance — benefit from resilience approaches that protect individual assets: advanced radiation hardening and error-correcting circuitry; larger fuel loads or refueling systems to perform evasive maneuvers; and signature reduction, chaff, and decoy systems. While some protection methods, such as the deployment of defensive “bodyguard” satellites, are costly, they can introduce novel operational considerations for an adversary. But it is unaffordable to ensure a resilient architecture through asset-level protection alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These approaches should be combined with constellations that leverage different resilience philosophies. Several proposed LEO constellations leverage proliferation to ensure survivability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/si6JWLH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image74&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 70: Mission Assurance Contributors.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project with data from the Department of Defense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dramatic drops in the cost of space launch have made it feasible to rapidly proliferate and reconstitute satellites — and to do so more cheaply than they can be shot down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proliferation strategies are attractive for their potential to complicate adversary targeting and introduce new technology increments rapidly. Such satellites could be constructed to minimize unit cost, with lower reliability thresholds, commercial-grade electronics, and shorter orbital lifespans, to be replenished frequently with upgraded systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systemic threats, however, challenge efforts to achieve resilience through proliferation. A sustained counterspace campaign would likely generate large quantities of debris in crowded LEO orbits. Nuclear explosions in space could deny large swathes of the LEO environment. Cyberattacks remain an omnipresent area threat, both for proliferated and exquisite architectures. The threat posed by these area effects makes it more urgent to embrace multiple resilience strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing the number of orbital regimes in the sensor architecture can enhance system-level resilience. Leveraging multiple orbital regimes complicates an adversary’s ability to exploit failure modes common to that orbit. LEO constellations benefit from large numbers, but their proximity to Earth makes them vulnerable to aforementioned area threats. MEO, GEO, and HEO constellations, meanwhile, might involve fewer assets with less provision for replenishment but are more difficult to engage with some directed-energy and direct-ascent weapons and potentially more economical to harden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More critically, a multi-orbit architecture can complicate adversary mission planning. Adversaries facing such an architecture would encounter challenges in synchronizing attacks. A direct-ascent or co-orbital attack on MEO or GEO assets may take substantially longer to execute compared to attacks on LEO. If attacks were launched simultaneously, the earlier disruption to LEO layers would give warning time for MEO and higher satellites to employ defensive maneuvers or other measures. If attacks were phased to strike multiple orbits at once, the long transit time of co-orbital weapons or missiles in GEO or HEO would offer warning time for defensive measures in MEO or LEO. A diverse architecture both creates targeting dilemmas and complicates tactical surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I don’t want to be in any one orbit. . . . I want us to be as widely distributed over as many choices of orbital regimes as we can effectively use, because I want to pose the adversary such a difficult problem that they’ll choose not to fight it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future sensor architecture cannot be a monoculture. Wartime scenarios are likely to include targeted attacks on individual satellites and area threats that threaten many. An architecture reliant on a single orbit and optimized for a single resilience philosophy will be simpler for adversaries to counter than a multi-layer approach, which presents dramatically different vulnerabilities. The increasing importance of space sensing makes it imperative to avoid so-called “common mode failures.” A future missile tracking constellation cannot only be proliferated, it must leverage a diversity of sensors to complicate adversary targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;staying-on-track&quot;&gt;Staying on Track&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missiles are no longer niche weapons, they are weapons of choice. They have become “foundational to our adversaries’ way of war, and missile defense has become foundational to integrated deterrence and the defense of the nation.” The creation of a new elevated sensor architecture will be similarly foundational to the future missile defense enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 40 years, seven successive presidential administrations have expressed support, at least on paper, for fielding a space sensor layer capable of providing not just missile warning but also high-quality tracking capabilities necessary to support the missile defense mission. To date, none has yet done so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is now beginning to change. Substantial strides have been made toward a robust space sensing capability. That past vision has never been closer to realization than it is today. Breakthroughs in space launch, networking, and sensing technologies have created opportunities for realizing a robust elevated sensor architecture. Substantial institutional attention is now being paid across the U.S. national security enterprise, with significant investments to match. Recent emphasis on acquiring proliferated low Earth orbit (pLEO) constellations was a good start, but contending with near peers will require much more. As emphasized by Assistant Secretary of Defense John Plumb, “Resilience is kind of a never-ending quest.” To achieve robust capability and mission assurance, the future sensor architecture must orbit in multiple altitudes and domains, prioritize designs that deploy sooner, and provide denser coverage of latitudes for the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The necessary policy, programs, and institutions are in place. What is needed now is the oversight, resourcing, and systems engineering authority to make the future architecture resilient, timely, and capable. To be resilient, the future architecture must be orbitally diverse. To be timely, it must deploy capability with an eye to graceful deployment and to prioritizing lower-latitude coverage. Finally, it must deliver the quality of data necessary for missile defense — fire control-quality tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This long-awaited elevated sensor architecture will be achieved. When it is, its uses will extend well beyond missile warning, missile defense, and missile defeat. Indications, warnings, and attributions from these assets will bring clarity to decisionmakers in crisis situations and better inform and protect servicemembers in the field. Just as the Global Positioning System (GPS) has had countless commercial applications and the Defense Support Program missile warning constellations have benefited wildfire detection, new missions and use cases will emerge for these elevated sensors as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of space becoming a warfighting domain will not be fully understood for some time. It is, however, already clear that elevated sensing is critical for air and missile defense. As the number of exotic space threats continues to multiply, there is a risk of neglecting the seemingly pedestrian air and missile threats below. As tempting as it may be to deprioritize the missile defense mission, the requirement for fire control-quality tracking must not be abdicated. It must stay on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix&quot;&gt;Appendix&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report used Systems Toolkit (STK), SMARTSet, and other simulation and visualization tools to inform its analysis. The modeling performed is notional and intended to illustrate concepts and tradeoffs involved with sensor architecture design. To better highlight these, the team constrained the parameters being investigated in its analysis. The design of an operational architecture would involve higher-fidelity modeling for cost, maintenance interval, solar activity, hardening, launch schedules and missile design, conjunction, link budgets, and many other parameters. In brief, these models are demonstrative, not prescriptive. They are not reference architectures but exhibits for the design tradeoffs involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sensor-level-analysis&quot;&gt;Sensor-Level Analysis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team performed infrared sensor and signature analysis using STK’s Electro-optical Infrared (EOIR) module. Infrared background data was imported from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) gridded data sets and processed with Python and NASA Panoply software. The team modeled a notional hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) (Figure 4) with Autodesk Fusion 360 and applied temperature maps to vehicle surfaces in Blender, using open-source surface temperature estimates. These assets were then placed into the STK simulation environment (Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracking hypersonic signatures is challenging because hypersonic weapons are not often the brightest objects in the scene. These weapons often appear as a single, slightly brighter pixel in a 4,000-by-4,000 pixel, wide-field-of-view (WFOV) image; while detectable by machine, these raw images are difficult to interpret with the naked eye. The infrared images furnished in this report are specifically scoped and processed to make these challenges visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 10 illustrates challenges associated with isolating hypersonic signatures from background clutter. The series of images are derived from STK’s EOIR simulation suite and picture an HGV as seen from a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite orbiting at 1000 km. The raw image (left) represents a “crop” of a potential WFOV sensor, with a resolution of 256-by-256 pixels and a per-pixel FOV of 450 microradians. The simulated sensor operates in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR) band, with a wavelength of between 3.5 and 5 microns. The band selected is illustrative; various bands in the short- and mid-wave regions present different advantages. Radiometric features, including noise equivalent irradiance, were minimized to the degree the HGV could be distinguished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first image depicts the raw output of this sensor. Unlike with bright plumes in the boost phase, the pixel containing the hypersonic weapon is dim — it is not among the brightest in the scene and cannot be distinguished with the naked eye. The brightness difference caused by the hypersonic weapon cannot easily be resolved by observing a single frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visualizing the signature instead requires analysis of several frames with the hypersonic weapon in motion. By estimating the movement of each pixel across the frame, it is possible to filter the hypersonic weapon’s motion from other objects in the scene. The second image depicts the motion vectors of each pixel over 20 successive image frames, processed with the OpenCV library’s Farneback optical flow algorithm. The false-color image encodes the optical flow vector of each pixel with a separate color, depicting a color variation for the pixel containing the moving hypersonic weapon. The third image displays an enlarged version of this false-color image, with contrast adjustments applied to make the HGV pixel more visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resultant images are illustrative and do not depict operationally sensitive features of hypersonic tracking systems. An operational system would offer substantially greater performance headroom. Moreover, atmospheric conditions can substantially change the signature of a vehicle; these were left to the standard atmospheric and cloud models included with STK EOIR. Finally, the simulations did not use high-fidelity maps of the hypersonic vehicle’s surface temperatures. A real hypersonic weapon would have significant temperature gradients across its surface and generate a wake of superheated gas and plasma with unique infrared emissivity characteristics. A weapons engineering process would include these detailed parameters, but these are not necessary to illustrate the principles discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 7 illustrates the thermal gradient on a hypersonic weapon’s surface. To make these characteristics visible to the reader, the HGV was imaged from an uncrewed aerial system (UAS) placed approximately 80 km away with a 256-pixel focal plane array (FPA), 35 cm aperture, and a tight, 0.01-degree total FOV. This is not representative of an operational system but best illustrates the concept being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Figure 25 is constructed to illustrate the effects of motion blur and sensor jitter. The sensor FPA is 256 pixels, with an 0.001-degree FOV, placing the HGV signature in the center of the image. The FPA has an integration time of 10 milliseconds and the final image includes this signature with an added 0.005mrad jitter. Figure 24 uses apertures of various sizes from geosynchronous orbits to illustrate how aperture affects sensor resolution. Again, sensor resolution and immediate field of view (IFOV) are left to generic parameters intended to highlight the impact of aperture size. The largest aperture is set to an arbitrarily large diameter of 10 m, while the two successive apertures, 60 cm and 30 cm, show the progression in resolution with smaller, more realistic diameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;constellation-level-analysis&quot;&gt;Constellation-Level Analysis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team also used STK to assess satellite constellation design tradeoffs. Constellation designs illustrated in the report were similarly selected to highlight design principles — inclination, orbital altitude, sensor FOV, and orbital configurations — and their impact on sensor coverage. Specifically, the report displays constellation designs evaluated for their two-satellite (stereo) coverage, which is necessary for missile tracking and fire control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several visualizations directly depict real-life constellation designs. Figure 38 leverages data from the Space Force’s catalog of tracked space objects to define the orbits of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites. The coverage figures depict the maximum coverage footprints possible from each satellite. The latest and final SBIRS satellite, SBIRS GEO-6, was not included in this visualization. Similarly, Figures 59, 60, 61, 62, and 63 depict the Tranche 0, 1, and 2 constellation designs being contemplated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other visualizations contain notional constellation designs produced through optimization studies. The project team leveraged various approaches to find configurations that minimized the number of satellites needed for stereo coverage of a given area. These studies also produced configurations of near-minimum constellation designs inspired by numbers publicly given for forthcoming constellations (Figure 27) (Tracking Layer, RMW/MT-MEO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These optimization studies draw from the considerable literature written on the subject. Many of the configurations investigated in these studies were Walker or modified Walker configurations with different parameters on inter-plane spacing. Walker constellations are a family of constellation designs that distribute satellites in equally spaced, equally inclined circular orbits. Such a design is attractive to mission designers because of the stability of their geometry: the forces that perturb satellite orbits (such as those associated with atmospheric drag, the non-uniform nature of Earth’s gravitational field, and the Sun and Moon’s gravity, among others) affect all satellites in the constellation approximately equally. This symmetric design allows satellite operators to plan similar station-keeping maneuvers for all satellites in the system, giving them approximately equal operational lifetimes. Walker configurations are common among operational position, navigation, and timing (PNT) satellite constellations, such as the European Space Agency’s Galileo satellite system. Other satellite constellations, such as the U.S. Space Force’s Global Positioning System (GPS) or Iridium Communication’s constellation, use adaptations of the Walker constellation design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walker constellations can be described by six parameters: semi-major axis, the number of orbital planes, the number of satellites per plane, the relative phasing between satellites in adjacent planes, the spacing between planes, and the planes’ inclination. For circular orbits — which have an eccentricity of zero — the constellation can also be described by the orbiting altitudes of its satellites, which stays constant over the course of the satellites’ orbital period. The coverage of such a constellation is also affected by a seventh, eighth, and ninth parameter: the field of regard (FOR) of the sensor on board, requirements for stereo or greater coverage, and solar exclusion, which defines angles where a sensor’s view is degraded by the light of the Sun in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These parameters must be tuned to minimize the number of satellites needed for persistent stereo coverage: coverage by two or more satellites at once, at every point in time, in the relevant region of analysis. The study team primarily analyzed coverage of a global region and a smaller, Indo-Pacific-focused region between 15 degrees South and 55 degrees North latitude (Figure 66). To preserve the generalizability of the study, these analyses assumed a maximum possible FOR for each satellite constellation; higher-fidelity details of detection and characterization challenges are not addressed; and the results presented in the following two sections correspond only to line-of-sight coverage analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To evaluate possible designs, the research team leveraged STK’s Analyzer module to test millions of possible configurations for coverage. This analysis began with the construction of simplified, non-representative designs for every orbital altitude to exemplify the altitude trades at play (Figure 34).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To construct this relationship, the study team used STK Analyzer’s Design of Experiments (DOE) tool to explore an entire swath of design possibilities. The model was simplified to assess simplified stereo coverage to minimize the computation time needed, with no constraints on solar exclusion. More detailed assessments, including constraints on sensor FOR, solar exclusion, and other factors, were performed for the other constellations visualized in this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOE tool parametrically defines a series of Walker Delta constellations by systematically combining ranges of orbital altitudes, numbers of orbital planes, numbers of satellites per plane, and inclinations, evaluating their suitability for stereo coverage using user-determined “Coverage Definitions” and “Figures of Merit.” This study relied on a global coverage definition consisting of a grid of points, spaced by six degrees, positioned 20 km above the Earth’s surface. Under these definitions, coverage can be evaluated at each of the points in the coverage grid, which are separated from one another by six degrees in both latitude and longitude space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These studies defined successful stereo coverage by constellations’ ability to minimize average stereo coverage gap time to zero. That is, the number of seconds over a one-day study period — during which any point in the coverage region is observed by fewer than two satellites in the constellation — cannot be greater than zero. When satellite constellations achieve continuous stereo coverage for a particular region, this figure of merit requirement is satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each orbital altitude between 500 and 36,000 km, the team evaluated hundreds of thousands of permutations of Walker Delta constellations. Although many different constellation architectures satisfied the figure of merit requirement — as many overpopulated satellite constellations offer much denser coverage than what is required — only two constellations per altitude met this study’s definition for optimality: one that offers continuous stereo coverage while minimizing the total number of satellites in the system, and one that offers continuous stereo coverage while minimizing the total number of orbital planes in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

This can inhibit the detection of dim targets. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimal constellations were identified algorithmically by first sorting the list of Walker Delta constellation permutations for each altitude by average stereo coverage gap times and removing those with non-zero times. This step eliminates those constellation architectures that fail to satisfy the figure of merit requirement. Next, the minimum total number of satellites and minimum total number of orbital planes of the remaining constellation architectures should be identified and noted. To identify the optimal constellation — minimizing the total number of satellites — the architectures with more than the minimum total number of satellites should be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, there is more than one constellation architecture in the filtered list that offers the minimum total number of satellites. To select a singular, unique architecture, the list was filtered to include only those architectures that also use the minimum number of orbital planes. This is because multiple launches are generally needed to populate multiple orbital planes. All else being equal, a constellation of many planes with fewer satellites per plane is more costly than a constellation of fewer planes with more satellites in each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where needed, the list of remaining constellation architectures was sorted by inclination, and the design with the lowest inclination was labeled as most optimal, as less-inclined orbits generally correspond to lower launch costs. The process for identifying constellations that minimized the number of orbital planes is similar to the process described for minimizing the total number of satellites, but the list of architectures that satisfy the figure of merit requirement should first be filtered to only include those with the minimum number of orbital planes, then again filtered to only include those with the minimum number of total satellites — a reversal of the previously described order of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resultant constellation configurations, and the total numbers of satellites they represent, were graphed using the Python Plotly library. The resultant figure (Figure 34) illustrates the results of this optimization study conducted for every altitude between 500 and 36,000 km at 50 km increments. The study team applied a minor smoothing function to interpolate between these increments and highlight the underlying relationship between altitude and the number of satellites required for coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An operational constellation configuration, however, must account for more detailed constraints on performance. Each satellite in a constellation can be assumed to encounter some time where their sensors may be unavailable, either during calibration or during periods where the Sun is sufficiently close to the sensor background (solar exclusion) (Figure 71). These can considerably increase the number of satellites required to develop a constellation design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, reference constellations, including Figures 16, 17, 27, 28, 35, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 51, 52, 53, and 54, are optimized with constraints on solar exclusion. The total FOR of each sensor was modeled to provide the maximum footprint attainable. LEO reference constellations, all modeled at 1,000 km altitude, were conservatively modeled with a 30-degree solar exclusion parameter. MEO constellations, at 7,000 and 10,000 km altitudes, were modeled with a 16-degree solar exclusion parameter. This adds a 30-degree angle outside the sensor FOR where the presence of the Sun would inhibit sensor function. These figures are intentionally arbitrary and not reflective of operational systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The larger number of parameters required different approaches for discovering optimal designs. Testing every possible configuration, as with the DOE studies informing Figure 34, required over 800,000 simulation runs to analyze. To discover designs for reference constellations, the research team leveraged STK Analyzer’s built-in genetic optimization suite to find minimum possible designs. The use of the NGSA-II optimization algorithm reflects common practice in other constellation optimization studies. Using NGSA-II, STK Analyzer could automatically explore and test possible combinations of inclination, planes, satellites per plane, and other parameters, measuring their resultant impacts on coverage. This approach minimized the number of simulation runs needed to discover the frontier of possible optimal configurations. Of these, the study team manually selected configurations that minimized the number of orbital planes necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This series of more detailed optimization studies formed the basis for several of the satellite configurations and mixes presented. The LEO orbital plane included in Figures 46, 51, 52, 53, and 54 represent the results of optimization studies performed for smaller coverage regions, of both the polar region above 55 degrees latitude and a regional, Indo-Pacific-focused band between -15 and 55 degrees latitude. Other configurations, such as Figure 28, demonstrate the significantly larger numbers of satellites needed when the per-satellite FOR is reduced. Combinations of “optimal” coverage layers were then devised from the basis of these studies. While these configurations do not represent the optimal configuration of an operational architecture, they demonstrate constellation designs that could reasonably exemplify the orbital tradeoffs at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

The authors assess the likelihood of North Korea selling its missile and nuclear technology onwards, and the kinds of technology that may be for sale and to whom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The September 2023 meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un raised concerns over the possibility that Pyongyang may supply Moscow with arms to support its war of aggression in Ukraine. Subsequent reports of North Korean transfers of ammunition to Russia and unconfirmed intelligence of suspected ballistic missiles transfers solidified those concerns. While the fact of Russia – host to one of the world’s most capable military–industrial complexes – turning to North Korea for arms was shocking, it did not come as a surprise to those familiar with the latter’s long history of arms trading and missile proliferation activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has exported missile technology since the 1980s and has, on several occasions, also transferred technology directly relevant to the development of nuclear weapons. Despite the introduction since 2006 of a progressively extensive sanctions regime against North Korea and its proliferation activity by the UN Security Council (UNSC), North Korean exports of missile and nuclear technology have persisted. Considering developments in North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities in recent years, the range of technologies that Pyongyang may be able to offer potential customers has also expanded. These technological advances, combined with the expansion of the UNSC sanctions regime over the past two decades, as well as other recent developments – like North Korea’s apparently expanding military collaboration with Russia, Moscow’s increasing disregard for UN sanctions, and North Korea’s reopening after the Covid-19 pandemic – make a reassessment of North Korea’s missile and nuclear exports timely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper builds on existing literature on North Korea’s missile and nuclear proliferation, supplementing it with expert interviews and leveraging the emergence of new information and cases related to North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities and transfers over the past decade. The authors consider the potential for future missile and nuclear sales by Pyongyang, asking: how likely is North Korea to sell its missile and nuclear technology onwards, what technology may be for sale, and to whom? With a growing technological offering and a continuing need to generate hard currency, incentives for North Korea to sell its missile, nuclear and dual-use technologies to foreign customers persist. As well as North Korea’s more novel technologies potentially being for sale, Pyongyang’s technological progress may also have created surpluses of older technology which it may be looking to sell off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite clear supply-side drivers, there are a range of restraining factors that are likely to prevent an all-out onward proliferation bonanza emanating from North Korea. A variety of factors have whittled down the potential markets for these technologies, while the restrictive sanctions landscape and unprecedented monitoring of the Korean peninsula have also worked to reduce opportunities for sales and increase the risks posed by interdiction. North Korean concerns over the possibility of its more advanced capabilities falling into adversary hands, thus potentially putting its own deterrent at risk, are also likely to temper its willingness to export such capabilities, despite the potentially high price tag that could be attached to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changing geopolitical landscape resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may, however, open new opportunities for North Korea. Russia’s willingness to engage in military trade with North Korea could give other countries the green light to accept North Korean arms, missiles and perhaps even nuclear technology. There remains a real risk of a broader collapse of the UNSC sanctions regime and the resurgence of North Korea’s arms and missile export enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the analysis of North Korea’s expanded technological offering, reduced customer base and other factors affecting export decisions – and the clear need to pay attention to the issue – this paper presents 10 recommendations to help in countering North Korean missile and nuclear technology proliferation. These recommendations are organised in two categories, which attempt to address the supply side of the problem – deterring, dissuading and encouraging North Korea to refrain from engaging in onward proliferation – as well as demand-side factors – by trying to reduce North Korea’s customer base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2023, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un travelled by armoured train to Russia’s far east to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kim’s visits to the Vostochny Cosmodrome and a fighter jet factory in Komsomolsk-on-Amur further raised existing concerns that the two countries were seeking to exchange military technology. Indeed, recent research has confirmed that hundreds of shipping containers, likely carrying ammunition, have been moved from North Korea to Russian military bases since the leaders’ meeting. The meeting was preceded two months earlier by the visit of Russian and Chinese delegations to North Korea to mark the 70th anniversary of the Korean War armistice, with officials from Moscow led by Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. Russia and North Korea – both countries under extensive international sanctions and with acute military equipment needs – put on a strikingly united front. Notably, Shoigu was treated to a defence exhibition featuring many of North Korea’s newest weapons systems – including UAVs, short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) and even ICBMs. In November 2023, South Korean intelligence publicly shared its suspicions – otherwise unconfirmed – that North Korea may have already sent SRBMs to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pyongyang has long been an exporter of missile and nuclear technology; this has included exports of Nodong medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) to Iran and Pakistan in the 1990s, Scud SRBMs to a range of customers (largely in the Middle East) through the 1980s and 1990s, as well as nuclear reactor technology to Syria, and uranium hexafluoride gas to Libya in the early 2000s through the proliferation network run by Pakistani nuclear scientist AQ Khan (Boxes 1 and 2 summarise North Korea’s historical trade).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s exhibition of missiles to Shoigu is far from the only indicator that Pyongyang remains open for business to countries looking to procure missile and even nuclear technology. Reporting by the UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1718 Committee Panel of Experts (PoE) has noted that Pyongyang has engaged in missile cooperation with Iran and Syria as recently as 2020 and 2019, respectively. A 2020 documentary film of unclear veracity entitled The Mole also showed an actor – playing the part of a private arms dealer – venturing to Pyongyang undercover in 2017 and being offered a wide range of short- and even intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs). While most of the handful of known nuclear technology transfers by North Korea date back two decades, the last publicly known case of North Korea offering nuclear-weapons-relevant materials on the open market – in that instance, the isotope lithium-6 – was uncovered just six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has engaged in these transfers despite an expansive UNSC sanctions regime that prohibits most trade with the country, including a prohibition on trade with the country in missile and nuclear technology, and most types of arms, in place since 2006. Pyongyang’s advancements in its nuclear and missile capabilities have had an impact on what, how and to whom North Korea may sell its nuclear and missile technology in the future. Its experience in identifying customers and engaging in illicit trade under the international sanctions regime over the past two decades will also have influenced its patterns of onward proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developments in the international sanctions regime and North Korean missile and nuclear capabilities, as well as changing geopolitical dynamics, necessitate a re-examination of North Korean onward proliferation. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has resulted in the widening of existing schisms in the international community, with countries opposing Russia’s aggression against Ukraine on one side, and those that have supported Russia or remained ambivalent on the other. Those in the latter camp, which includes North Korea and Iran, appear to have found in Russia a willing trading and diplomatic partner as Moscow seeks to reduce its isolation. This study is thus particularly timely in light of the recent high-level meetings between Pyongyang and Moscow, and the more general apparent expansion of relations between the two countries, as well as other developments – such as the gradual reopening of North Korea’s borders following the Covid-19 pandemic, the expiry in October 2023 of the UN Security Council (UNSC) embargo on trade in nuclear-capable missile technology with Iran, and the expiry of UNSC proliferation-related targeted financial sanctions on Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper builds on existing academic literature, expert analysis and case studies relating to North Korea’s onward proliferation of nuclear and missile technology by considering how what is already known about North Korean transfers of nuclear and missile technology may have been – or may in the future be – impacted by some of the technological, economic and geopolitical developments outlined above and throughout the paper. Based on this analysis, the authors explore developments relevant to already-identified factors, as well as emerging ones, that shape whether Pyongyang may transfer its nuclear and missile technology, and what wares North Korea may transfer, and to which client states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;existing-literature&quot;&gt;Existing Literature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some previous work has considered North Korea’s onward proliferation, the literature is limited and much of it is more than a decade old. Much of the existing literature on North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes has focused on developments in its nuclear and missile capabilities, Pyongyang’s revenue-raising efforts under sanctions, and its procurement of WMD and military technologies. More broadly, discussion of the threat posed by North Korea’s weapons programmes has focused on denuclearisation and (more recently) deterrence, rather than on the threat posed by onward proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most insightful and in-depth work on North Korea’s onward proliferation was published by Joshua Pollack. In 2011, Pollack examined North Korea’s missile sales and how these had changed since what he called the “Golden Age” of North Korean missile exports in the 1980s. Pollack observed that Pyongyang had shifted – with some exceptions – from supplying complete missile systems to transferring parts, materials and expertise instead. He also noted that North Korea was moving its focus towards cooperation in joint missile development and production with a smaller number of countries – particularly Iran and Syria – as opposed to transferring full missiles to a range of customers. Pollack argued that these shifts stemmed from market saturation for North Korea’s missile offerings as a result of past missile transfers and requirements for components and maintenance services from past customers. He also attributed this shift to a deprioritisation of ballistic missiles among some potential customers, particularly in the Middle East, in favour of Western-supplied piloted aircraft, cruise missiles and missile defence systems, and pressure from the US to curtail engagement with North Korea. As the authors outline in this paper, some analogous factors appear to be impacting on more recent supply and demand drivers in North Korea’s onward proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pollack also examined North Korea’s nuclear exports, arguing that Pyongyang seems to have prioritised technological exchange instead of currency generation in the limited number of known transfers of its nuclear technology. However, Pollack also argued that Pyongyang may seek to leverage its nuclear expertise and technology for revenue generation in the future. Naturally, his work relied on the data available to him over a decade ago; since then, additional cases and data points on North Korean missile and nuclear exports have afforded greater understanding. The present-day utility of other works in understanding the phenomenon of North Korean onward proliferation of missile and nuclear technology has been even more limited by their age. Others studying North Korean onward proliferation have limited their study to discrete aspects, such as transfers to non-state actors, or China’s role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has also benefited from research on adjacent topics such as North Korea’s arms exports and sanctions evasion networks. Notably, in her 2016 book, Target Markets: North Korea’s Military Customers in the Sanctions Era, Andrea Berger identified a range of factors driving demand for North Korean military goods, considering customers in three categories: “resilient” customers with deep political and military ties to Pyongyang, “reluctant” customers with few other options in terms of suppliers, and less committed “ad hoc” customers. Berger’s work highlights the unique nature and context of specific relationships and their developments, which has helped to inform some of the analysis in this paper. Others have considered the role of specific entities in North Korean proliferation activities and procurement networks. However, no study in the past decade has revisited the question of North Korea’s onward missile and nuclear proliferation activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-arguments-research-methodology-and-structure&quot;&gt;Key Arguments, Research Methodology and Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given its growing technological offering and continuing need to generate hard currency, North Korea has significant incentives to sell its missile, nuclear and dual-use technologies to other states. Surpluses created by technological advances may also be available for sale. However, despite clear incentives to proliferate, a range of factors that work to constrain North Korea’s sales are likely to prevent an all-out onward-proliferation bonanza. Many of these drivers and restraints, discussed in the literature, continue to shape North Korea’s onward proliferation activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the changing geopolitical landscape – particularly following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – may provide new opportunities for North Korea. Russia’s willingness to engage in military trade with North Korea may give other countries the green light to breach UN sanctions and accept North Korean arms, missile or even nuclear technology. There is a real risk that such developments could lead to a resurgence of the North Korean arms and missile export enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In re-examining the topic and building on others’ work, the authors were able to consider a wider range of data, as new material has become available over the past decade. Part of the reason for limited research on North Korean onward proliferation is the methodological challenge inherent in the study of Pyongyang’s proliferation activities. The extreme opacity of the North Korean economy, its regime and policymaking process makes the country a challenging target for researchers. Like any other country, North Korea guards the details of its military programmes – including procurement, technological developments and exports – particularly closely, making the study of its nuclear and missile matters especially difficult. Partial data on specific cases most often becomes available with a significant time lag, following interdictions of technology, the discovery of major proliferation rings such as the AQ Khan network, or in reports on the movement of North Korean technicians to customer states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More data on North Korean missile and nuclear developments and transfers is available than ever before. The UNSCR 1718 PoE has produced almost 20 detailed public reports since it was established in 2009, rich in details on North Korea’s sanctions evasion activities and illicit networks. Pollack’s work was largely unable to benefit from this data, which has provided insights into North Korea’s missile relationships with Egypt, Iran and Syria, as well as its dual-use technology exports. Increased access to open source data by investigative journalists, think tank analysts and academics has also led to the proliferation of analysis on NorthKorean capabilities and sanctions evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors have supplemented the information available in public sources with 20 semi-structured interviews conducted with experts through video conferencing and in person in London between June and early August 2023. Interviewees included former government officials and former members of the UNSCR 1718 PoE, as well as academics and other researchers working on matters related to North Korea’s nuclear, missile and broader military programmes, North Korean domestic, economic and security policies, and broader Asian security issues. Interview questions were tailored to each expert’s respective area of knowledge, but broadly focused on North Korea’s missile and nuclear programmes, proliferation activities and networks, domestic and foreign policies, and international efforts to counter North Korean proliferation. The interviews allowed the authors to gauge current views on the state of North Korea’s onward proliferation enterprise and to test hypotheses as they were developed over the course of the research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the methodological challenges in studying matters related to the North Korean missile and nuclear programmes, and the dearth of current data on the subject, interviewees often had to caveat their assessments, noting that they were based on limited data and assumptions and were thus speculative. Consequently, the authors extend the same disclaimer to the findings outlined in this paper. Nevertheless, common themes in interviewees’ assessments emerged and these were supported by further research, allowing the authors to confidently formulate their conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors’ analysis is presented across two main chapters. Chapter I considers recent developments in North Korea’s technological offering and assesses which technologies may be of interest to customers. Chapter II outlines the likely factors influencing North Korean decision-making on whether to transfer its nuclear and missile technology, and how these may have evolved in recent years. The paper concludes with 10 recommendations to address supply of and demand for North Korean missile and nuclear technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea has long acted as an exporter of ballistic missile technology – particularly SRBM systems. According to one estimate, North Korean supply made up around 40% of the ballistic missiles supplied to the developing world between 1987 and 2009; more than 500 missile systems in total.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The genesis of North Korea’s own missile programme was the transfer of Soviet-design Scud SRBMs from Egypt in the 1980s. North Korea in turn supplied the Scud system – and related components – to a wide range of customers, many based in the Middle East. This included Iran, Egypt, Syria, Libya, Yemen and the UAE. North Korea also transferred Scud missile technology to Myanmar and Vietnam in East Asia.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Pyongyang transferred Nodong MRBMs, a scaled-up version of the Scud SRBM, to Iran and Pakistan in the 1990s. Both states’ programmes have advanced far beyond this early North Korean assistance – as is the case for a number of North Korea’s earlier customers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea has also transferred IRBM technology to Iran and has allegedly offered IRBMs to private arms dealers in the past.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The authors are aware of just four cases in the public domain of North Korean transfers of technology pertaining directly to nuclear weapons capabilities, from the 1990s to 2016.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nuclear trigger technology to Pakistan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korean technicians assisted Pakistani weapons scientists in producing krytrons – components used to trigger a nuclear device – in the mid-1990s. This was part of a series of technological deals between the two states, with Pakistan receiving complete missiles and parts from North Korea, as well as North Korea receiving centrifuge technology, and its technicians training in Pakistani facilities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Uranium gas to Libya.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In December 2003, after the revelation that Libya was purchasing a centrifuge enrichment plant from the AQ Khan proliferation network, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors in the country were shown three mystery cylinders of uranium hexafluoride (UF6), a uranium gas that is fed into the centrifuges during the enrichment process. US analysis of contamination on the outside of the cylinders showed that they had originated in North Korea’s Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Centre. The IAEA later stated that the 1.7-tonne shipment was the first of a larger planned series of transfers of 20 tonnes between North Korea and Libya brokered by Khan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A reactor for Syria.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea worked with Syria to construct a nuclear reactor near Al-Kibar in Syria between the late 1990s and 2007 (when the site was bombed by Israeli aircraft). The reactor – the most extensive example of North Korea’s nuclear exports in the public domain – was a smaller-scale version of North Korea’s 5-megawatt (MW) graphite-moderated reactor at Yongbyon. Intelligence reports suggested that the reactor would have been capable of producing plutonium for one or two weapons annually, had it been fuelled or gone critical.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Lithium-6 is an isotope that can be used in thermonuclear weapons – either directly, or by irradiating it in a reactor to produce tritium. The advert was posted openly on a business-to-business (B2B) website and listed a phone number linked to the North Korean embassy in Beijing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-north-koreas-current-technological-offerings&quot;&gt;I. North Korea’s Current Technological Offerings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has acquired and developed – and therefore could potentially export – a wide range of missile and nuclear technologies. This potential technological offering has expanded over the past decade as North Korea has advanced its missile and nuclear capabilities – both indigenously and through acquisition of technology from other countries. While the offering has expanded, the fundamental range of options for transfer has not changed, and includes everything from fuel cycle facilities and complete missile systems to capabilities for building these facilities, individual dual-use goods and components, as well as expertise relating to elements of missile production, and to the nuclear fuel cycle or to weaponisation. Table 1 summarises some of the main types of transfers North Korea could consider (there is evidence of past exports across all these categories, except for the transfer of complete nuclear warheads).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s developments in nuclear and missile technology over the past decade could have a dual effect on its supply of technology. First, newly developed capabilities – which are more attractive to a wider range of customers – could be transferred. Second, the replacement of older designs and systems with newer, higher-quality or more capable ones could create surpluses of older systems, goods and expertise that could be exported. These surplus items may be appealing to a different subset of customers – those with less ability to absorb technology, lower capability needs, limited budgets or perhaps similar older systems in need of spare parts or interoperable systems. At the same time, North Korea’s expanding catalogue of missile systems and nuclear capabilities raises the question of whether it could now consider a sub-set of this catalogue of technologies to be too strategically important for its own security for them to be transferred to customers abroad. These security concerns are explored further in Chapter II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;missile-technology-offerings&quot;&gt;Missile Technology Offerings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, North Korea has mostly exported short-range, and sometimes medium-range, ballistic missiles. Could recent developments in its short-, medium- and longer-range ballistic missiles create new sales opportunities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developments in SRBM and MRBM Capabilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has debuted a series of solid-fuelled SRBMs since 2018. Although the exact specifications of the systems – some of which have multiple variants – are unclear, they will likely replace the liquid-fuelled Scuds and Tochka-type systems in North Korea’s arsenal, and potentially also in its sales catalogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea first revealed the KN-23 solid-fuelled SRBM during a 2019 parade. Since then, several variants have been developed, including smaller shorter-range and larger longer-range versions. KN-23 variants have been developed for deployment on a variety of platforms, such as road mobile transportable erector launchers, underground silos, railcars, submarines and underwater silos. The KN-24 – another solid-fuelled SRBM, with a range of around 400 km – was also unveiled in 2019. A further 2019 debut, the KN-25, is a solid-fuelled system described in North Korean media as a “super-large multiple rocket launcher”. It has four launch tubes on each launcher, and a range of up to 380 km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These newer solid propellant missile systems could appeal to customers for several reasons. Beyond their quicker time to launch, solid-fuelled systems are easier to operate than liquid-fuelled ones (which require greater expertise for maintenance and handling of highly explosive, corrosive and toxic fuels). Older liquid-fuelled systems also require the procurement of a range of support vehicles and handling facilities – increasing the human and financial investment required. North Korea has also recently shown signs of exploring ampulisation technology – a set of measures to ensure maintenance of liquid-fuelled missiles in combat readiness for longer periods of time. This could both make a more appealing product, overcoming some of the shortcomings of liquid-fuelled systems, and see North Korea find ways to reduce the maintenance burden and investment required by customers for liquid-fuelled products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developments in IRBM and ICBM Capabilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean advances in missile technology that have received the most media attention relate to the country’s long-range systems, such as IRBMs and ICBMs. This includes the KN-17 IRBM, successfully tested in 2017; the KN-26 medium- range submarine-launched ballistic missile, successfully tested in 2019; the KN-28 (Hwasong-17) ICBM, successfully tested in 2022; and, most recently, the Hwasong-18. The latter, debuted in February 2023 and successfully tested in April, is North Korea’s first solid propellant ICBM – a significant development in its strategic capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have suggested that Pyongyang may consider transferring some of its longer-range missile systems to customers abroad. Indeed, North Korea did transfer IRBMs to Iran, which were likely based on imported Soviet missile technology. However, the strategic significance of these systems to North Korea’s own defence – and the insights they could betray into North Korea’s technology (including the state of its missile capabilities and domestic production capability, or reliance on foreign components) – may disincentivise Pyongyang from transferring them to others. The strategic importance that North Korea places on its missile capabilities, as well as the limited opportunities for intelligence collection on these systems by external actors, may make Pyongyang sensitive about having these capabilities fall into the hands of an adversary. Similar considerations could be applied to the Hwasong-8 carrying a hypersonic glide vehicle, which – while being an SRBM – has strategic significance for Pyongyang that could make transfer less likely. Although, as some of the experts interviewed for this project noted, any missile technology might be for sale for the right price, and Pyongyang may not care about its technology being intercepted provided it has received payment from the customer. These competing security and economic considerations are discussed in more detail in Chapter II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential customer base for longer-range missile systems is also limited. There are few countries that would benefit from an ICBM capability (which suggests the need to hold at risk an adversary further than 5,500 km away) who have not already shown some interest in developing these systems domestically. The relationship between ICBMs and nuclear weapons, in which one technology often necessitates the development of the other to have strategic value, also reduces any potential customer base. Iran may be the most obvious exception, and would likely benefit from further collaboration with North Korea on long-range missile technology (albeit probably without the transfer of complete long-range missile systems), and is a case discussed further below and in Chapter II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Potential for Surplus Sales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a risk that North Korea may export surplus older systems, notably those based on liquid-fuelled Scud or Nodong technology that are likely being replaced (or may be in future) by newer solid-fuelled systems. North Korea used to frequently parade these missiles, but a system based on Scud or Nodong technology has not appeared in a parade since 2017. The KN-02, an early North Korean-manufactured version of the solid-fuelled Soviet OTR-21 Tochka missile, which was first unveiled in 2007, has also not been paraded since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it remains unclear how many newer systems North Korea has been able to deploy, the apparent phasing out of older missile models raises questions as to what might have happened to these older systems, and whether surpluses could be for sale. Arms marketing material of unclear veracity handed over in the 2020 undercover documentary film The Mole included Scud C and Nodong (marketed as Scud E) systems and supporting vehicles allegedly for sale, as well as a system described as “Tochika-U”, likely the KN-02.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surplus missile technology – including full missile systems, spare parts or components – may appeal to customers still operating Scud- or Tochka-type systems (see Table 2). However, this group of states is declining in size, with the returns of maintaining such aged technology diminishing, if not already non-existent – particularly if states have access to more modern options in the form of more advanced missiles or UAVs. The two states that received North Korean Nodong-type missiles in the 1990s, Iran and Pakistan, both indigenised the technology and have since progressed in their own programmes, although surplus Nodong-type systems could potentially be of interest to new customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ANTGa59.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 2: States Holding Scud and Tochka Technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: IISS, The Military Balance 2023 (Abingdon: Routledge, 2023) and a survey of other open source information. Note: Current data is difficult to compile – but inclusion in this table suggests that there is either evidence these countries currently operate these systems, or little evidence to suggest that the capability has been retired.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surpluses created by the superseding of North Korea’s Scud fleet could lead to parts being available for sale. Evidence of North Korean trade in spare parts for these older systems, though, is dated. A 2013 shipment of Scud parts originating in North Korea, including connectors, relays, voltage circuit breakers and a barometric switch, was interdicted en route to Egypt from Beijing. North Korean markings were visible on two of the items – suggesting manufacture in North Korea. Egypt has continued to maintain and operate Scud systems, and it is not out of the question that more recent (and successful) shipments of spare parts and components have occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea may have other uses for its surplus missiles besides sales – including recycling, cannibalising them for materials, parts or components, mothballing them for future contingencies, or launching them in provocations. The war in Ukraine may also yield lessons. As one interviewee pointed out, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has demonstrated the continued value of short-range systems on the battlefield, and this may lead North Korea to retain older systems in great numbers for future contingencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collaboration in Missile Development&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the sanctions environment and an evolving customer base, North Korea’s missile proliferation behaviour has largely adapted from the shipment of full systems towards the provision of spare parts, materials and technical support. As an unnamed UN member state noted to the UN PoE in 2019, “Instead of exporting full missile systems, the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) is sending technicians to a buyer country and establishing a complete supply chain”, noting that this pattern had been seen in Egypt, Iran and Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missile collaboration with Syria has been ongoing for many years. North Korean technicians were reportedly involved in the upgrade of the Scud D to create a manoeuvrable re-entry vehicle in 2008. A delegation of Syrian engineers allegedly spent six years in North Korea from 2011 to 2017, and further exchanges took place around 2016, with a group of North Korean missile technicians staying on a Syrian airbase. North Korea has also supplied missile-related components to Syria as part of its collaboration with the country. Five containers of commercial items (many with applications in Scud missiles) originating in Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Denmark, Japan and the US were seized by an unnamed state while being shipped to Syria from Dalian, China in 2014. The PoE also noted in 2015 and 2016 that a Syria-based official from North Korean arms exporter Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation (KOMID) imported ball bearings and fibre optic cables, as well as bringing in three North Korean technicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s missile collaboration with Iran has involved higher-end missile technology, given that Iran has a large (and expanding) missile industrial base and export capability of its own. Collaboration with Iran has not always been smooth sailing, with trust levels taking a significant hit after North Korea supplied the BM-25 Musudan IRBM, a missile with significant technical issues. US information suggests that over recent years there has been further collaboration on technology that is potentially of use in longer-range systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2016 sanctions notice suggested that North Korean technicians were collaborating with Iranians on an “80-ton rocket booster” being developed by North Korea. The notice stated that Iranian technicians from liquid-fuel missile producer SHIG travelled to North Korea for this purpose and named individuals who had travelled to Pyongyang for “contract negotiations”. It also suggested that KOMID had made shipments of missile-related goods to Iran, including “valves, electronics and measuring equipment suitable for use in ground testing of liquid propellant ballistic missiles and space launch vehicles”. Further information on this collaboration was included in a 2021 UN PoE report, which noted that North Korea and Iran had “resumed cooperation on long-range missile development projects”, with the report focusing in particular on the development of a space launch vehicle (SLV). This collaboration included the “transfer of critical parts” and 13 North Koreans were named who had travelled to Iran to support KOMID’s work. The report also noted the high level at which such engagement was signed off within Iran, naming senior SHIG and Aerospace Industries Organization (AIO) officials, and noting that the current director of AIO was a “key player in negotiations” when he had been the SHIG director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nuclear-technology-offerings&quot;&gt;Nuclear Technology Offerings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short of the transfer of a complete warhead – something that all experts interviewed for this paper suggested was highly unlikely – there is a range of other nuclear-related technologies that North Korea could transfer. For instance, Pyongyang could sell nuclear material or isotopes, with a range of options short of weapons-usable fissile material. However – beyond the transfer of dual-use technologies with applications relevant to the production of nuclear weapons – the transfer of nuclear-weapons-relevant technology, nuclear material and other relevant isotopes was judged relatively unlikely by experts interviewed for this paper, for a number of reasons outlined further below. Nevertheless, previous North Korean transfers of nuclear technology – including reactor technology, nuclear materials, and even weaponisation technology (see Box 2) – suggest that the possibility for future transfers exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While US government assessments have suggested that North Korea likely has an arsenal of “up to 60 nuclear warheads”, there are significant gaps in public knowledge about the state of its programme and stockpile. Early attention to North Korea’s nuclear programme focused on the plutonium aspects of the fuel cycle and the 5-MW reactor at the Yongbyon Nuclear Research Centre. While it was suspected that North Korea may have uranium enrichment capabilities, the plutonium programme was, for a long time, the only publicly known North Korean nuclear weapons pathway. This changed in 2010, when a US delegation, including former Los Alamos National Laboratory Director Siegfried Hecker, was shown a centrifuge facility at Yongbyon. There have been no further public reports of foreign access to North Korea’s nuclear facilities since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty persists regarding other potential enrichment facilities, the numbers and types of centrifuges North Korea may be deploying, and many other details about its uranium and plutonium fuel cycles and weaponisation processes. The limited number of recently seized shipments of goods or materials destined for North Korea’s centrifuge programme or other parts of the country’s nuclear weapons programme also restricts public understanding of the programme and how its recent development may have shaped North Korean nuclear wares available for sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reactor and Enrichment Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although North Korea has shown a willingness to transfer reactor technology in the past – namely, in its provision of assistance and materials for the construction of the Al-Kibar reactor in Syria – it would be incredibly risky for North Korea and any potential customers to engage in a further reactor construction project. Any such project would be relatively easy for foreign intelligence agencies to detect using a variety of human, signals and technical means. Reactors are large construction projects that are visible in open source satellite imagery. Even if the reactor being constructed were relatively small (as in the case of Al-Kibar), and even if most of the necessary physical materials could be sourced overseas, the development of such a structure would almost certainly be noticed by various national intelligence agencies, the IAEA or even open source analysts using commercially available satellite imagery, drawing significant scrutiny. As in the Al-Kibar case, other intelligence sources – such as human and signals intelligence – would likely reveal any North Korean involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Centrifuge enrichment technology perhaps offers greater opportunities for export, as demonstrated by the AQ Khan network’s sale of centrifuges and related technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya in the 1990s and 2000s. The transfer of centrifuge capabilities could range from a small number of machines with associated expertise to a full turnkey centrifuge facility, and could be harder to detect than the construction of a reactor, given that facilities can be constructed covertly underground and that they lack the distinctive visual signatures of a nuclear reactor. However, the construction or expansion of such facilities in past instances has also been monitored using open source satellite imagery in the context of North Korea, Iran and other states. Disassembled shipping – consisting of many shipments of largely benign-looking industrial goods and materials (as seen in some of Khan’s transfers of enrichment technology to Libya) – could also make detection difficult. However, greater awareness of the risks posed by the transfer of centrifuge technology among customs and intelligence agencies following the Khan case, as well as the enhanced ability of NGOs to collect and monitor data on illicit trade activity, could mean that multiple connected shipments would be detected more readily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limited knowledge of North Korea’s centrifuge technology makes it difficult to assess whether it has old surplus centrifuge models it may want to sell and/or whether it possesses newer technologies that are more appealing to customers. During his 2010 visit, Hecker observed a facility with around 2,000 machines that appeared to be based on the Pakistani P-2 centrifuge model, and fabricatedwith rotors made from “alloys containing iron” according to one North Koreanengineer – interpreted by Hecker to mean maraging steel. As some analysts have noted, that North Korea is still operating these P-2 type machines is “an assumption that should be treated with caution”. Indeed, a paper published by a North Korean scientist indicates at least some interest in more advanced models of centrifuges. Taking the Iranian nuclear programme as a point of comparison, Tehran has developed multiple generations and models of centrifuges in a similar time span. It would be reasonable to assume that North Korea could have made comparable progress. However, the nature of the Iranian nuclear programme and the motivations behind it are different from those of North Korea: Iran is more focused on publicly displaying its technical capabilities and trying to create leverage in the context of diplomacy over its nuclear programme, while North Korea is likely focusing on improving the efficiency of its centrifuge technology to expand its fissile material stocks and nuclear arsenal, with no public communication aspect – at least for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movement towards more advanced models would suggest that North Korea has developed domestic advanced centrifuge production capabilities and may indicate that there are fewer chokepoints for the sub-technologies required for production. Full centrifuges (whether more or less advanced) or constituent dual-use technologies (discussed further below) could both appeal to customers. However, the extreme secrecy surrounding this aspect of North Korea’s programme would make the practicalities of marketing and sharing this technology difficult and risky for North Korea, as the interdiction of shipments could provide significant insights into Pyongyang’s programme. Development of more advanced centrifuges could also create surpluses of older machines and spare parts – items that Khan’s network tried to provide to Iran and Libya, with mixed success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intangible Nuclear Transfers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the transfer of tangible enrichment or reprocessing technologies, North Korea may seek to capitalise on the export of intangibles – that is, expertise, skills and design information relevant to nuclear weapons development. Such an offering could certainly be useful for states looking to develop aspects of a nuclear fuel cycle or move towards a nuclear weapons capability. Transfer of intangibles could accompany tangible transfers, as was the case in Syria when North Korea deployed experts and transferred technology to construct the Al-Kibar reactor. It could also involve North Korea aiding other states in solving specific technical challenges, such as North Korean technicians’ support to Pakistan in producing krytrons in the 1990s (see Box 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of the different aspects of North Korea’s nuclear knowledge will ultimately be decided by Pyongyang’s prospective customers/partners, but the most useful and unique offering is likely to be North Korea’s tacit knowledge – the things that cannot easily be codified and transferred, and only learned by doing. This could include the experience of producing fissile materials through reactor operation and reprocessing, running an enrichment plant, or experience related to nuclear weapons design, testing and weaponisation (an even rarer area of expertise outside the nuclear weapons states). This sphere of knowledge might be of particular interest to Iran, a state that has mastered enrichment technology and may have an interest in pursuing a weapons capability in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dual-use-technologies&quot;&gt;Dual-Use Technologies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the level of monitoring of North Korea’s borders has risen, and the transfer of full missile systems or other large missile and nuclear-related technology has thus become riskier, North Korea is likely to look to export more innocuous dual-use technologies and materials – those that have both civilian and military applications. While North Korea likely relies on imports for a large proportion of the higher-end items for its WMD and military programmes (the so-called “chokepoint” technologies), as its programme has advanced, Pyongyang has undoubtedly indigenised the production of some dual-use components and materials, and may look to capitalise on these production abilities and any surpluses through onward sales. It may also look to act as a broker, leveraging its procurement networks around the world to source dual-use goods for customers, either for use directly by the customer or by North Korean technicians assisting in missile- and nuclear-related manufacturing and development projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the transfer of dual-use items from North Korea would still violate UN sanctions, such transfers would be more inconspicuous than the movement of large missile and nuclear technologies. North Korean-manufactured goods could be laundered within the extensive legitimate global trade in dual-use technologies and would, if uncovered, be less politically contentious than full systems. Russian or Chinese markets provide extensive laundering opportunities which could be capitalised on with minimal risk, as Moscow and Beijing have historically turned a blind eye to North Korean sanctions violations. Online platforms – such as the Chinese B2B site used to market North Korean lithium-6 in 2016 (see Box 2) – could provide opportunities for the anonymous sale of technology, obfuscating obvious links to North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is precedent for North Korean transfers of dual-use goods to countries that had previously purchased North Korean missile technology. For example, PoE reports note the interdiction in 2010 of a shipment of aluminium alloy rods, copper bars and brass discs to Syria, with the products likely originating in North Korea. A shipment of North Korean-origin graphite cylinders was also interdicted in 2013 en route to Syria. North Korea has also previously marketed its dual-use machine tools overseas. In 2013, the UN listed Korea Ryonha Machinery Joint Venture Corporation – North Korea’s main machine tool producer – for its involvement in North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes. As researchers noted in 2014, the company attended a trade fair in Dandong, China in 2013 and marketed machine tools in China and Russia under the names of “Millim Technology Company” and “Koryo Technologies” (or “KORTEC”), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-evolving-factors-influencing-supply-and-demand&quot;&gt;II. Evolving Factors Influencing Supply and Demand&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While technological developments in North Korea’s missile and nuclear programmes help dictate what may be available for sale, a range of political, economic and security factors also play an important role in influencing both demand for – and North Korean willingness to supply – these technologies. This chapter explores in more detail what is likely to motivate and restrict both North Korea and its potential customers when it comes to engaging in missile and nuclear technology transfers. While the need to generate revenue remains a strong motivator for Pyongyang, demand for its wares has been progressively waning. This decline is the result of several factors, namely, changing technological needs and greater supplier choice among Pyongyang’s customers, as well as concerns over the quality of North Korean goods and the risk of interdiction. The chapter also maps out the changing sanctions context, and how Russia’s arms purchases from North Korea could undermine the sanctions regime and risk a resurgence of North Korea’s arms and missile export enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;continued-need-for-revenue-generation&quot;&gt;Continued Need for Revenue Generation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the past, revenue generation remains a key incentive for North Korean missile technology transfers. North Korea’s economic troubles long predate the UN sanctions regime, with the country repeatedly defaulting on debt repayments from the 1970s onwards. The imposition from 2006 of increasingly expansive UNSC sanctions on the country’s economy exacerbated existing economic challenges, while more recent sectoral sanctions introduced in 2016 and 2017, and the border closures stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic, have put North Korea in an especially precarious economic situation. States are prohibited from virtually all economic engagement with the country, leaving it cash-strapped and desperate to seek out and exploit economic opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precisely how much revenue North Korea has generated, or may be able to generate, through the sale of missiles or nuclear technology is challenging to ascertain. Public reporting on individual North Korean missile and nuclear transfers is extremely limited and very rarely includes data on the value of transactions. Furthermore, reported figures may not include estimates for the transfer of expertise, manufacturing facilities, or maintenance and support services. Some of the available figures unsurprisingly suggest that military transfers offer North Korea lucrative opportunities for revenue generation, with estimates – which are based on sources that are either unclear, dated and/or difficult to verify – citing figures in the hundreds of millions of US dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples provide insights into the revenue raised from individual transfers,transactions or weapons systems. While comparing the prices offered for ballistic missile systems is extremely challenging, a review of the prices of North Korean conventional weapons offerings supports the hypothesis that North Korean systems are generally cheaper than the alternatives. The prices offered in the 2020 documentary The Mole, and to British arms dealer Michael Ranger in a deal around a decade ago, suggest that North Korean arms are often offered at a price below the market rate of equivalent systems. This has historically made North Korean arms appealing to customers, particularly in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mole saw marketing materials – including a price list for North Korean weapons systems – handed to an actor playing the role of an investor during a 2017 trip to Pyongyang. The price list included a cost breakdown for missiles with different types of warheads, launchers and associated handling vehicles. Missiles and vehicles were priced per unit and in quantities of five, three or two units. For example, Scud C missiles with high explosive warheads were offered for $2.795 million per unit, but sold in lots of five for $13.975 million, whereas Nodong missiles (termed Scud E for extended range) were offered for $4.94 million per unit and $24.7 million for five. While they are impossible to verify, such values are not outlandish compared to figures seen elsewhere. Sale of components and parts can also be lucrative: the PoE noted in 2015 and 2016 that a KOMID official based in Syria (with the rank of major general) shipped ball bearings and fibre optic cables, and brought in three North Korean technicians, earning over €100,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea could potentially leverage more sensitive nuclear transfers for extensive profits far above the market rate, especially in situations where the customer has no alternatives. Illicit procurement networks often see intermediaries monetise the risk by charging a premium, and North Korea could do this through selling goods it has either produced or procured, as part of a package for customers. Analysis of the cost of the UF 6 sold to Libya through the Khan network in the early 2000s suggests that the three cylinders of 1.7 tonnes were sold for $2 million, the equivalent of 40 times the then market rate. Similarly, transfer of North Korea’s more advanced missile systems (or, more likely, related technology) such as its IRBM, ICBM or newer hypersonic technologies may offer particularly lucrative opportunities for revenue generation. However, as mentioned, Pyongyang may be reluctant to transfer some of these higher-end technologies to avoid betraying the details of its advanced systems and production capabilities to adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the high risk, larger projects such as the construction of facilities could also garner significant sums. While of unclear veracity, media reporting from 2009 citing an Iranian defector and Israeli intelligence claimed that Iran financed Syria’s purchase of the Al-Kibar reactor from North Korea, paying Pyongyang between $1 billion and $2 billion for the project. The Khan network – and especially Khan’s Libya deal – saw the transfer of a 10,000-centrifuge plant for between $100 million and $200 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean arms sales have also been heavily shaped by the financial incentives of North Korean arms trading company representatives – essentially, the salespeople – working overseas. These representatives are often accredited as diplomats, work out of embassies, and are entrepreneurial in building relationships and exploiting opportunities. Indeed, they are compelled to be entrepreneurial: North Korea’s overseas missions, including embassies, are believed to be self-funding, tasked with raising funds to sustain themselves and the regime back in Pyongyang. While the financial driver at this working level may manifest itself through arms sales, decisions to sell missiles and nuclear technology are likely far more sensitive, and almost certainly are taken in Pyongyang. Nevertheless, North Korean operatives abroad are likely to be under pressure to identify revenue-generating opportunities to decision-makers in Pyongyang, which may include potential deals for the transfer of missile or even nuclear technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also potential for North Korea to engage in barter trade as it has in the past, exchanging missile and nuclear technology, expertise and materials for other goods. Experts interviewed for this paper pointed to oil, grains and fertiliser as goods that North Korea may be especially interested in procuring in a barter arrangement. In the 2000s, the Myanmar government “gifted” rice to North Korea in exchange for “technical services and equipment”, which reportedly included conventional weapons. Recent reports have suggested that Moscow may offer Pyongyang food in exchange for munitions. Such barter arrangements allow North Korea to receive payment without needing to access the international financial system, while also accessing goods it is prohibited from (or may struggle in) procuring freely as a result of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transfers of the full missile and nuclear systems that are likely to prove most lucrative to North Korea have become riskier and more challenging due to increased global awareness of UNSC sanctions on North Korea, improved interdiction capabilities and expanded open source scrutiny of the country’s trade activities. This led some of the experts interviewed to ask whether Pyongyang would continue to pursue missile and nuclear transfers, or shift to less risky and easier to move commodities for revenue generation. North Korea’s increasing exploitation of cryptocurrency is one example of an alternative yet highly lucrative revenue-generation line, with cryptocurrency hacks allegedly generating $1.7 billion for North Korea in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sales of more innocuous but still sanctioned goods and services – such as textiles or the export of construction labour and IT services – are also less risky sources of revenue. For instance, coal has historically been a major source of revenue for North Korea and has been directly linked to the financing of the country’s missile and nuclear programmes, although it may be seen by the broader international community as being less politically sensitive than trade in missile, nuclear or other military technology. However, North Korea’s desperate economic situation may mean that it does not have the luxury of choosing between revenue streams, and may instead require it to pursue all means available to raise funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;opportunities-for-technology-barter&quot;&gt;Opportunities for Technology Barter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One form of barter trade which may be particularly attractive to North Korea is the exchange of its missile- or nuclear-related expertise and capabilities for that of other states, or engagement in collaborative missile and nuclear technology development. As mentioned earlier, striking deals which benefit North Korea technologically has long been at the core of the country’s proliferation deal-making. As Pollack has noted in his work on North Korea’s nuclear trade:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the evidence is ambiguous, a careful examination suggests that many past transfers were actually done not for profit but in exchange for components or materials that benefited Pyongyang’s own nuclear program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the three nuclear cases that Pollack examines (see the first three listed in Box 2), he noted that each potentially had a barter aspect to them. However, evidence is admittedly thin in places. For example, assisting Pakistan’s krytron development came after the transfer of centrifuge components, drawings and plans to North Korea; transfers of UF6 into the Khan network may have been repayment for Khan’s assistance to North Korea in producing it; and North Korea could potentially have benefited from plutonium produced in the Al-Kibar reactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Pyongyang continues to develop its missile and nuclear programmes, exchanging complementary expertise or working on new advances in collaboration with partners will remain an attractive option, albeit one that likely has less necessity and more limited returns than in the past, given North Korea’s own recent technological successes in its nuclear and missile programmes. Priority areas for North Korea’s missile development – and for potential collaboration opportunities – are likely to include items outlined in the five-year plan for the development of defence science and weapons systems adopted at the Eighth Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea in January 2021. These include improvements in missile accuracy up to a range of 15,000 km, improvements in solid fuel propulsion for submarine-launched and ground-based ICBMs, military reconnaissance satellites, and R&amp;amp;D in hypersonic glide vehicles, nuclear-powered submarines and UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given North Korea’s technological successes and the sanctions regime, there is now a smaller range of countries that could both offer technology the country could benefit from and, importantly, be willing to offer such technology in exchange for North Korean wares. An obvious candidate would be Iran, as it has made great leaps in its centrifuge and missile programmes over the past decade. One expert interviewed for the project also suggested that there may be room for cooperation between Iran and North Korea on hypersonic glide vehicles. Russia could be another candidate. Further North Korean arms transfers to Russia (potentially including ballistic missiles) could allow North Korea to request technology from Russia’s extensive WMD and other high-technology programmes – such as its space launch or submarine programmes – in return. Moscow’s willingness to provide such technologies, given its historical commitments to non-proliferation and its potential security concerns vis-à-vis a North Korea with more advanced missile and nuclear capabilities, are not a given, but recent engagement seems to suggest a potential willingness to cooperate (see Box 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-3-war-in-ukraine-and-the-growing-north-korearussia-technology-transfer-axis&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 3: War in Ukraine and the Growing North Korea–Russia Technology Transfer Axis&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recent developments in North Korea’s relationship with Russia are concerning for the future of both non-proliferation efforts and the UN sanctions regime. Russia’s war in Ukraine has created a need for weaponry and materiel, as well as renewed efforts by an increasingly isolated Moscow to garner political support from a smaller range of allies and partners. Initial arms transfers of “infantry rockets and missiles” were allegedly made between North Korea and the Wagner Group in November 2022. More recently, research has suggested that hundreds of containers of weaponry – likely ammunition – have been transferred from North Korea to Russian military bases, while South Korean intelligence reported indications of North Korean ballistic missile transfers to Russia in early November 2023.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The potential for exchange of more advanced and strategically important technology is clear. In July 2023, Russian Defence Minister Shoigu was shown around an arms fair in Pyongyang by Kim Jong-un, where he viewed ICBMs, SRBMs, hypersonic missiles and UAVs. During Kim’s trip to Russia to meet Putin in September 2023, the Russian leader hosted his North Korean counterpart at Russia’s Vostochny Cosmodrome and noted North Korea’s interest in rocket and space technology. Media reports surrounding the meeting also suggested North Korea was interested in “advanced technology for satellites and nuclear-powered submarines”. Further details are yet to emerge. However, advances in missile technologies – including items identified in Pyongyang’s 2021 plan for the development of defence science and weapons systems – are also likely to be on North Korea’s wishlist for Moscow.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;With these breaches of the arms embargo and possible movement towards breaches on the prohibition on transfers of other technologies, the future of the UN sanctions regime – which in some senses has been on life support for several years – is precarious. In September 2023, around the time of Kim’s visit, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov noted that sanctions were “adopted in a completely different geopolitical situation” and accused Western states of “lies” over humanitarian support. If Russia, a UNSC permanent member, so blatantly violates sanctions and is seen to use North Korean arms or missile systems in Ukraine, it may lead other states to look to North Korea for arms, and could potentially open the floodgates for further North Korean arms and missile sales.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ideological-and-foreign-policy-considerations&quot;&gt;Ideological and Foreign Policy Considerations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, North Korea’s sales opportunities have been influenced – in part – by its broader foreign policy relationships and objectives, and vice versa. Pyongyang’s arms exports began during the Cold War, expanding significantly through the 1970s and 1980s, as North Korea built its military–industrial complex. Through its Cold War military sales, the country sought to demonstrate its commitment to the socialist cause, strengthen the capabilities of fellow members of the socialist bloc, and gain favour with Moscow and Beijing. Even during the Cold War, however, ideology was not the sole driver of North Korea’s military transfers, with the export of military technology and expertise being part of its broader efforts to consolidate relationships with developing countries around the world and compete with Seoul for influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the end of the Cold War, North Korea has continued to do business and conclude cooperation agreements in a range of fields with a variety of countries, with no indication of any discrimination on ideological grounds or links to any known direct North Korean security interests. Unlike Iran, which has been known to transfer missiles to its proxies across the Middle East, North Korea does not have similar relationships with proxies on whom it might rely to achieve certain security objectives, and thus be incentivised to transfer capabilities to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent geopolitical developments may create greater opportunities for North Korea to strengthen political ties through technology transfer. Russian arms purchases from, and growing engagement with, North Korea creates political benefits for Pyongyang. While new UN sanctions resolutions have been an unlikely prospect in recent years, with no agreement even on new entities to be added to the UN sanctions list, the relationship with Russia helps to bring North Korea out of its sanctions isolation. The apparent degradation of the international sanctions regime could also see a resurgence in what Berger describes as “reluctant” customers, as well as “ad hoc” ones. This could make other potential customers view relationships with North Korea involving arms transfers as acceptable, and could even give North Korea new opportunities to pursue such relationships alongside (and in support of) Russian activities in Africa, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, these recent developments mean that North Korea has more to play for in pursuing its international relationships and in using technology to that end. However, there is no indication that ideological sympathies or diplomatic priorities are going to be the only or even the primary driver of North Korean sales of military technology abroad – including missile and nuclear technology. Rather, these considerations will serve as a facilitator for, and an additional benefit from, Pyongyang’s illicit trade, which will still likely be driven by opportunism and the need for revenue generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sanctions-transfer-environment-and-risks-of-interdiction&quot;&gt;Sanctions, Transfer Environment and Risks of Interdiction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk of interdiction, sanctions and other punitive measures is a major disincentivising factor for most countries when it comes to engaging in missile, nuclear and most other trade with North Korea. As such, North Korea’s biggest customers for arms and missile technologies today largely fall within what Berger describes as the “resilient” group. These are customers that continue to engage in business with Pyongyang despite UNSC sanctions, driven by longstanding political and military ties or else similarly under international arms embargoes or otherwise isolated. Iran, Syria and potentially Myanmar (see Box 4) clearly fit this profile, as countries that have little to lose politically by engaging with North Korea, have historical ties with Pyongyang (including in the sphere of military cooperation), and which are themselves isolated and limited in their weapons procurement options. The benefit (or necessity) of doing business with North Korea outweighs the risk of further sanctions or other reprimands for these countries from the US, the UN or others, as their economies are already subject to sanctions. However, the actual demand for North Korean longer-range missile and/or nuclear technology from these countries is likely to be tempered by some of the other factors outlined in this paper – including absence of need for these more strategic technologies, perceived unreliability of North Korea as a supplier, and the availability of similar options from other isolated suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-4-myanmar-a-relationship-renewed&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 4: Myanmar: A Relationship Renewed?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Myanmar is believed to have previously purchased ballistic missile technology from North Korea alongside a more extensive variety of other conventional weapons technology. However, the specifics of the transfers are opaque. In 2012, the US government noted that Myanmar had been a customer of North Korea’s missile programme, while a leaked Myanmar government report suggested that Burmese military representatives had visited a missile factory in North Korea capable of producing Scuds and likely Nodong missiles in 2008, alongside a range of other facilities in the country. A more recent, unconfirmed report notes that 20 North Korean missile technicians were in Myanmar until 2015, and – citing independent researchers based in the country – that missile cooperation has restarted between the two countries in the wake of the 2021 military coup.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Myanmar’s military regime has also been accused of nuclear weapons aspirations in the past, notably around 2010, centred around allegations by a defector who worked in Myanmar’s strategic industries – but these were largely discounted. Experts interviewed for this paper expressed scepticism that Myanmar would be interested in a nuclear weapons capability, noting the country’s pressing economic and internal security challenges. Past reports that Myanmar was interested in building a nuclear weapon have also been rejected by members of the US intelligence community and other experts. The fact that the Myanmar military’s primary concern is domestic armed insurgency also raises questions over the utility of procuring advanced missile capabilities or nuclear weapons technology from North Korea, although such capabilities could help the regime feel more secure against external invasion.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving large physical shipments to and from North Korea covertly (see Box 5) has become markedly more difficult amid an improved understanding of common sanctions-evasion practices, and in light of the ability of governments and non-governmental organisations over the past decade to scrutinise North Korea’s airports, ports and border crossings using satellite imagery, trade and corporate data, and other investigative resources. The border closures caused by the Covid-19 pandemic (see Box 6) and resultant reductions in trade have also made recent movements of goods easier to detect. Increased monitoring and the potential for interdiction has therefore raised the risks of undertaking transfers of missile and nuclear goods, as well as deploying North Korean technicians, from North Korea itself. In contexts where interdiction was not possible previously, ships believed to be carrying suspicious cargo for Pyongyang have been pursued by naval vessels and forced to return to North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-5-evolving-means-of-transfer&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 5: Evolving Means of Transfer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Historically, transfers of North Korean missiles were undertaken by state-connected air freight and shipping fleets. In large part, a shift away from the more obvious state-connected modes of transport towards commercial shipping has been observed since the mid-2000s. A 2021 PoE report, however, notes that state-owned shipping companies have continued to play a role. According to one unnamed UN member state, KOMID – which has been called North Korea’s “primary arms dealer” and main exporter of missile technology – has reportedly cooperated with Iran’s SHIG on shipment logistics, engaging in “shipments to Iran, using vessels belonging to the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL), and routinely operating non-stop voyages from one third country ports to Iran”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Geography also determines the easiest shipment routes, with rail connections across the border between North Korea and Russia allegedly being used to move weapons to the Wagner Group in November 2022. Russia and China’s evolving stance on North Korean sanctions could make North Korea’s land borders important vectors for proliferation-sensitive exports. However, more recent arms transfers between North Korea and Russia seem to have involved initial shipments from the former to a Russian submarine base using Russian-flagged and military-connected cargo ships running a “shuttle” service with their automatic identification system (AIS) transponders turned off to avoid detection.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The challenging logistical environment will likely see North Korean proliferation networks continue to adapt. Pyongyang may seek to fulfil more of its contracts entirely outside its borders, establishing manufacturing facilities in client states – as it previously had in Namibia to produce conventional weapons, for example – or in third countries, and relying increasingly on the extensive procurement networks it has established, notably in China but also around the world, to source the necessary components and materials. There may also be fewer interdiction risks if North Korean exports continue to shift towards projects that combine tangible and intangible support. In these arrangements – as seen in missile relationships with Iran and Syria, and the Al-Kibar reactor project – North Korean operatives can procure goods for projects largely outside of North Korea, and exports from North Korea can be limited to specific goods and technicians.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The constraint that the sanctions environment is currently imposing on North Korea is contingent to a significant degree on Russia and China’s future actions, with the evolution of North Korea’s growing relationship with Russia being pivotal. However, several interviewed experts noted that China’s willingness to turn a blind eye to North Korea’s onward missile and nuclear proliferation is not likely to be unlimited, especially in cases where developments affect China’s national security interests. Beijing is a signatory to a range of non-proliferation agreements and has its own security interests that may be undermined by North Korean ballistic missile and nuclear weapons technology transfers. For example, China’s clear interest in avoiding instability on the Korean peninsula, and particularly any proliferation actions by North Korea that might elicit a response from the US and its allies, could potentially lead Beijing to exert pressure on Pyongyang to prevent it from engaging in such transfers. However, the degree of influence that Beijing has over Pyongyang’s onward proliferation decision-making calculus is likely limited. Some analysts have argued that China’s interest in maintaining stability in Pyongyang actually makes Beijing reticent about applying political or economic pressure, unless the risks of inaction outweigh the costs (for example, in the instance of potential North Korean nuclear warhead or fissile material transfers). Ultimately, the degree of direct coordination between Beijing and Pyongyang on sensitive matters such as missile and nuclear transfers – which would likely take place at the highest levels – is very difficult to ascertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-6-the-covid-19-pandemic&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 6: The Covid-19 Pandemic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea shut its borders to all passenger and commercial traffic at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Satellite imagery in March 2020 showed North Korean ships being recalled to the country’s ports, while land crossings with China and Russia were closed and border fences, guard posts and patrol roads were reinforced and expanded. North Korea also stopped the rotation of diplomats from its missions abroad – as it likely also did with its missile and arms technicians and procurement operatives based overseas. The country, relatively isolated in normal times, closed itself off almost entirely from the rest of the world. In the second half of 2023, though, there were signs that the borders were starting to open up again. Movement through ports and land crossings increased, restrictions on some official travel eased in spring, and North Korean nationals abroad (including some workers) were allowed to return as of August 2023, with limited commercial flights restarting that same month.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is difficult to definitively assess the impact of these restrictions on North Korea’s procurement efforts and the onward transfer of missile and nuclear technology from the country. It is reasonable to assume that transfers slowed significantly between early 2020 and 2023. Several experts interviewed for this paper pointed to the pandemic restrictions as a reason why they were sceptical that North Korea was actively exporting missile and nuclear technology. However, North Korean technicians based overseas were also likely stuck abroad in customer states and unable to return home. As the country begins to open its borders and resume trade, missile and nuclear technology transfers may become more likely – particularly given recent North Korean efforts to exhibit its wares, and amid the further disintegration of the UN sanctions consensus. The restrictions on trade and travel since 2020 have also further exacerbated the economic situation within North Korea, creating further pressure to generate revenue or source critical supplies like food from abroad, which may further incentivise the sale of missile and/or nuclear technology.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security-concerns-over-advanced-deterrent-capabilities&quot;&gt;Security Concerns Over Advanced Deterrent Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security concerns, paired with the challenging transfer environment, will likely make North Korea carefully consider the transfer of certain particularly strategically important systems and technologies. These sensitivities are likely to stem from the risk that transferred technologies or information surrounding them may fall into enemy hands, with negative impacts for North Korea’s own nuclear deterrent. For example, North Korea’s adversaries could gain valuable information about North Korean capabilities from seized shipments of nuclear or missile technologies, related goods and materials, or even wreckage recovered from the battlefield. Intelligence can be derived from seized technologies, providing insights into manufacturing, supply chains and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examination of interdicted missiles, or wreckage recovered after their use, may yield insights into North Korea’s manufacturing capabilities or the specific types of technology that it is importing to develop its programmes. This could allow North Korea’s adversaries to better counter the country’s illicit supply chains. Nuclear forensic techniques could provide insights into North Korea’s fuel cycle if North Korean fissile material or contaminated goods were seized in transit. Intelligence gained through examination of seized or recovered goods can also be used to construct countermeasures. This is a particular concern with regard to more modern ballistic missiles that might yield insights to inform developments in missile defence capabilities and arrangements by the US or its partners such as South Korea and Japan. The transfer of certain newer systems unique to North Korea would also reduce the prospect of potential plausible deniability of Pyongyang’s involvement in the transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If North Korea is concerned about undermining its own security through transfers, this would lead to the development of two categories of systems. The first includes items that are core to North Korea’s security, and which would not be transferred: interviewees referred to these as the “crown jewels” or “top state secrets core to North Korea’s survivability”. This would include nuclear warheads and fissile material – which would be unlikely to be transferred for several reasons – as well as ICBMs and other missiles core to North Korea’s deterrent. The second category would include lower-level and older technology, which North Korea would be less concerned about transferring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter I explored some of the surplus technologies that may fall into this second category and discussed several reasons why North Korea may not be willing to transfer all of its older systems. A few further considerations may also follow from this security thesis. Reluctance to export newer systems and reveal information could lead to the development of export variants for the new SRBMs. However, this would require significant upfront investment from Pyongyang or its customers, which would be challenging in an environment with limited cash flow – which is exactly the situation in which North Korea and many of its historical and potential customers find themselves. It is also possible that if the design information of certain systems is compromised (for example, after wreckage is recovered after a test, or following a hack of the manufacturers), the security rationales against wider transfer for that particular system may be undermined, if concerns about the compromise of strategically important information on certain North Korean capabilities is indeed a consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;changing-technologies-and-markets&quot;&gt;Changing Technologies and Markets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological developments may also restrict demand for North Korea’s missile offerings. Chapter I outlined the remaining (but shrinking) market for the Scud-and Tochka-like technologies that North Korea may have in surplus. Indeed, due to its extensive history of Scud exports and – in some cases – related manufacturing capabilities, North Korea may have reduced its appeal as a supplier to some customers that managed to absorb the technology. However, in the present day, North Korea’s missile sales also have to compete with newer technologies and suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, militaries’ growing demand for UAVs is well documented. UAVs may be seen as a less expensive and more operationally appropriate system by some countries that would have previously sought short-range missiles. While UAV and SRBM capabilities differ significantly, including in their utility, the former may be well-suited – if not more desirable – for states without an active missile programme and in need of low-yield but high-precision capabilities to carry out limited and precise attacks in neighbouring countries or against factions on their own territories. UAVs are cheaper, more versatile, and easier to produce and transfer than ballistic missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has shown some advances in its UAV programme, with drones penetrating South Korean airspace in recent years, and two large novel UAV systems shown to Shoigu in Pyongyang in July 2023. However, Iran’s capabilities for producing and exporting these systems are more advanced: Iran has well-established UAV capabilities and has exported drones to partners in the region and further afield. Critically, Iranian UAVs have now been extensively battle-tested – not only by Iranian proxies in the Middle East but also on a large scale by Russian forces in Ukraine. As such, past customers of North Korean SRBMs may now look to Iran as a UAV supplier instead. As Pollack noted, the 1991 Gulf War helped to shape missile markets, reducing interest in North Korean products as cruise missiles played a prominent role. Russia’s war on Ukraine could also affect potential North Korean missile markets, although extensive UAV and missile use makes it difficult to establish possible lessons at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran is also an established proliferator of missile technology, having exported missiles to proxies and partners in the Middle East. With the expiry of the UNSC embargo on nuclear-capable missiles and related technology trade with Iran in October 2023, Iran may seek to expand its customer base and thus pose competition for North Korea in securing new customers for its missile technology (although such trade with Iran is still sanctioned by the US, Europe and others).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;claims-to-nuclear-responsibility&quot;&gt;Claims to Nuclear Responsibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final restraining factor – albeit one with unclear salience – consists of the non-proliferation norms that emerged after 1945, and North Korea’s notion of nuclear responsibility. The UN sanctions regime imposed on North Korea was, in some sense, an embodiment of these norms. Since acquiring a nuclear weapons capability, North Korea has repeatedly referred to itself as a “responsible nuclear power”, including in the context of onward nuclear proliferation. These are likely efforts by Pyongyang to normalise itself as a legitimate nuclear power outside the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) – akin to the status enjoyed by Pakistan and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an October 2006 statement, just days after North Korea’s first nuclear test and the subsequent UNSC resolution condemning it, North Korea’s foreign minister referred to the country as a “responsible nuclear weapons state [that] will never use nukes first and will not allow nuclear transfer”. These claims have most recently been codified in the September 2022 Law on DPRK’s Policy on Nuclear Forces (Section 10):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The DPRK, as a responsible nuclear weapons state, shall neither deploy nuclear weapons in the territory of other countries nor share them and not transfer nuclear weapons, technology and equipment concerned and weapon-grade nuclear substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the earnestness of these claims is unclear. By virtue of developing a nuclear weapons programme outside the recognised international non-proliferation framework – namely, the NPT – North Korea has already demonstrated its disregard for nuclear non-proliferation norms. Several experts interviewed for this paper also noted that North Korea has not offered any definition of what it means by “responsibility” in the nuclear non-proliferation context. However, the excerpt from the 2022 law could arguably be taken as a definition of what Pyongyang considers to be “responsible” behaviour by a nuclear power. Whether Pyongyang’s commitments can be taken at face value is debatable, but its past proliferation of nuclear technology after the 2006 statement should raise serious doubts. There is less of an international consensus regarding missile non-proliferation. North Korea has tended to deny allegations rather than make claims about responsibility when it comes to the transfer of missile systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a growing technological offering and a persistent need to generate hard currency, North Korea still has significant incentives to sell its missile, nuclear and dual-use technologies to foreign customers. It now has a wider range of more advanced missile and nuclear technologies than ever before, some of which may be available for sale to interested buyers. Pyongyang’s technological progress may also have created surpluses available for transfer, particularly Scud, Tochka and Nodong missiles, or even surplus or second-hand nuclear and dual-use technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these clear supply-side drivers, though, a range of factors work to constrain North Korea’s sales – particularly on the demand side of the equation – and these are likely to prevent an all-out onward-proliferation bonanza. The potential markets and customers for North Korean missile technology have been whittled down by a variety of factors, including North Korea’s assistance to customers in indigenising the technology it has sold, the emergence of competitors such as Iran, and the development of newer and more appealing technologies – namely, UAVs, but potentially also other suppliers and systems in future. The sanctions landscape and the unprecedented monitoring of the Korean peninsula also reduce sales opportunities and increase the risks of interdiction. Given Pyongyang’s recent technological advances, there may also now be only marginal returns on North Korean efforts to obtain technology for its own programmes through barter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns about putting its own deterrent at risk are also likely to temper North Korea’s willingness to export more advanced capabilities, despite the potentially lucrative price tag that could be attached to them. Offering these systems for sale is far riskier than peddling the Scud or even the Nodong systems that were based on well-understood and frugal 1960s Soviet missile technology. Insights gained from interdicted systems or those recovered from the battlefield after leaving North Korean control could do harm to North Korea’s national security. The export of such systems would increase the chances of them falling into adversaries’ hands, despite minimal recent large interdictions of North Korean military shipments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a continuation of some of the trends observed by Joshua Pollack in his work over a decade ago, the limited potential customer base, as well as a more challenging transfer environment, suggests that North Korea is most likely to continue engaging with established missile customers – those that Andrea Berger termed “resilient”, such as Iran or Syria. Future transfers are likely to involve dual-use components or intangible transfers of expertise rather than complete systems – because of limited demand and due to the greater chances of the latter being interdicted. North Korea’s extensive procurement networks outside its borders may also allow it to procure technology from third countries to transfer to customers, meaning that fewer direct shipments would be required. The ubiquity of largely anonymous online platforms may also help to identify potential customers and facilitate the sale of dual-use technology, despite the extensive international sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the changing geopolitical landscape resulting from Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine may bring new opportunities for North Korea. On the one hand, Pyongyang may benefit financially and technologically from technological exchanges with Russia. On the other, Russia’s willingness to engage in military trade with North Korea and Moscow’s ability to veto further UNSC sanctions against Pyongyang or any of its future customers may give other countries the green light to accept North Korean missile and maybe even nuclear technology. The cover provided by Russia’s – and, to a less public extent, China’s – patronship of Pyongyang could lead to a significant change in North Korea’s fortunes as a supplier. Although only time will tell how the relationship between Pyongyang and Moscow develops, there remains a real risk of a broader collapse of the UN sanctions regime and the resurgence of North Korea’s arms and missile export enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the above analysis – and the clear need to pay attention to the issue – this paper presents 10 recommendations, organised into two sets, to help in countering North Korean missile and nuclear technology proliferation. The first set concerns efforts to deter and dissuade Pyongyang from engaging in onward proliferation – that is, they address the supply side of the equation. The second set addresses the demand side, suggesting ways to reduce North Korea’s customer base. The recommendations call for an approach that relies both on diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang and on harder measures that signal a willingness to disrupt and punish violations of sanctions and international non-proliferation norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-for-addressing-supply-side-factors&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Addressing Supply-Side Factors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1: Clearly message and demonstrate commitments to interdict, learn from and exploit North Korean missile and nuclear transfers.&lt;/strong&gt; A concern that North Korea is likely to have over the transfer of its missile and nuclear technology – particularly more advanced or strategically significant systems – is the potential for that technology to fall into the hands of Pyongyang’s adversaries. This concern should be validated and leveraged. The US, the UK and their partners need to continue prioritising efforts at interdicting North Korean shipments of weapons technology, as per their UNSC obligations – either in transit or at their destination (for instance, in Ukraine, should Russia procure and use North Korean missiles in the future). They must also make clear that the technology will be inspected, shared with North Korea’s adversaries and used to help develop effective countermeasures, including missile defence. Outreach should also continue to be conducted on the relevant UNSC resolutions and through informal networks such as the signatory states to the Proliferation Security Initiative “Statement of Interdiction Principles”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2: Bolster intelligence efforts, engage with allies and support open source researchers as force multipliers.&lt;/strong&gt; Further bolstering intelligence collection to target potential North Korean procurement and export networks can help strengthen countermeasures across the board. The US, the UK, and Western and Asia-Pacific allies should ensure that the necessary processes are in place to allow for intelligence-sharing and collaboration in this sphere. They should ensure that new means to monitor potential intangible transfers (especially the movement of people such as technicians and engineers) are developed. This also includes greater exploitation of open source intelligence to further investigate North Korea’s relationships and monitor the internet for potential North Korean marketing of dual-use technologies on B2B websites. The lithium-6 and machine tool examples discussed above, as well as North Korea’s recent arms transfers to Russia, are all export or marketing activities that were uncovered by non-government researchers using open sources. Open source exploitation by non-governmental organisations can be a force multiplier when the intelligence community’s resources are stretched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3: Strengthen counter-proliferation-financing efforts to weaken the revenue-generating potential of North Korean missile and nuclear transfers.&lt;/strong&gt; Revenue generation is likely to be North Korea’s key driver for engaging in onward proliferation of missile and nuclear technology. Continuing to invest in efforts to prevent Pyongyang from receiving or moving funds can help weaken that incentive. While North Korea may receive some payment by way of barter trade (not involving the formal financial system), targeting financial flows can impact how lucrative Pyongyang believes its proliferation activities to be. This should include continued awareness-raising of international and multilateral sanctions on North Korea, of standards and best practices for countering proliferation financing (CPF), and of common sanctions-evasion methods. National governments and international organisations engaged on CPF issues should prioritise sharing best practices and resources – for instance, model CPF legislation or lists of entities suspected of supporting North Korean proliferation financing (even if these are not sanctioned). While there have so far not been any known cases of North Korea using cryptocurrency as payment for proliferation-related transactions, Pyongyang is clearly transitioning its activities to the online space and has engaged extensively in crypto theft for revenue generation. Ensuring that CPF efforts keep up with these adaptations will be critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 4: Include non-proliferation commitments in any nuclear negotiations with North Korea.&lt;/strong&gt; Any future negotiations with North Korea on its nuclear programme should include commitments to international non-proliferation and nuclear security standards. Including an explicit commitment from North Korea to not transfer nuclear technology to other states – particularly with reference to the 2022 law on its policy on nuclear forces and clarifying North Korea’s definition of nuclear “responsibility” – as part of future negotiations could help positively reinforce any existing tendencies in Pyongyang to present itself as a responsible nuclear custodian. Such an approach, however, would require some level of recognition (even if tacit) of North Korea’s nuclear weapons capability – a proposition that is the subject of much debate within the expert community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 5: Engage with China on preventing North Korea’s onward proliferation, including by highlighting implications for Chinese interests and security.&lt;/strong&gt; China has been a key facilitator for North Korean sanctions-evasion activity and likely has at least some, albeit limited, influence on Pyongyang’s decision-making in relation to onward proliferation. Engaging with China on the issue may therefore yield some benefit, especially if Beijing can be convinced to curtail Pyongyang’s access to transhipment routes, as well as financial and corporate infrastructure. To be sure, the likelihood of this approach’s success is dubious, as Chinese interests and security concerns diverge significantly from those of the US, Europe and other East Asian countries concerned with North Korean proliferation. In fact, creating instability in certain parts of East Asia might be in China’s interest if such instability were to absorb US resources and attention. There may be potential to incentivise Chinese cooperation, including through appeals to Beijing’s desire to be seen as a responsible nuclear power, as well as through continued identification and sanctioning of Chinese entities involved in supporting North Korean sanctions evasion. Taking a transactional approach may be another possibility – linking US openness to addressing issues of Chinese concern with Chinese willingness to prevent – or at least not support – North Korean onward proliferation activity. However, the currently limited state of dialogue between the US and China, as well as other issues such as the tension over semiconductor export controls and the issue of Taiwan, will make having an impact in this regard challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-for-addressing-demand-side-factors&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Addressing Demand-Side Factors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 6: Double down on counter-proliferation messaging and support.&lt;/strong&gt; If indications emerge that North Korea’s onward proliferation of missile and nuclear technology is starting to ramp up again, the US and its partners should consider making a clear statement that buyers of North Korean arms, missiles or nuclear technology will be heavily punished with sanctions and other tools. This messaging should, among other things, make clear that states purchasing North Korean technology will be cut off from Western technology across the board, and that they will be made subject to unilateral sanctions and other measures. Messaging should also continue to include the broader implementation of UN sanctions on North Korea. A tailored approach should acknowledge that some states may not perceive engagement with North Korea as problematic – despite international prohibitions to this end – and may actually be sympathetic to supporting the growing camp of anti-Western countries, or may be ambivalent about condemning or countering the behaviour of these anti-Western countries. As such, providing incentives to these countries to comply with their international obligations – whether through appealing to their standing as responsible members of the international community or by offering economic or other support – may be necessary. A combined “carrot and stick” approach is likely to be most effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 7: Consider offering alternatives to North Korean missile technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Following Recommendation 6, the US and its partners should consider offering alternative technologies or other incentives to potential customers when possible. Some states that seek to source missile capabilities from North Korea might do so because they lack – or cannot afford – alternative technologies or suppliers. As part of a targeted approach, the US and its allies should consider whether helping such states find alternative missile technology suppliers may be possible, without compounding the global proliferation problem or exacerbating situations of insecurity. Offering alternative sources of nuclear technology is, of course, a lot more problematic. In these instances, interested governments may be able to engage with countries on other strategic issues to identify drivers for the desire to acquire nuclear technology and identify possible solutions to addressing these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 8: Target demand-side countermeasures to specific customers and prioritise engagement with those that are most likely to be receptive.&lt;/strong&gt; At the same time, the US and its partners should prioritise engagement with countries that are likely to be most receptive to being dissuaded from engaging in trade with Pyongyang, and tailor approaches to individual potential customers. Trying to prevent missile transfers between North Korea and states that have had long-term missile cooperation partnerships with Pyongyang or which are themselves already subject to sanctions – the likes of Iran and Syria – through diplomatic engagement or threats is unlikely to bear fruit. Offering alternative suppliers in these instances is also not an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 9: Make North Korea an unreliable supplier and technical partner.&lt;/strong&gt; Countries interested in preventing North Korea’s onward proliferation should commit to efforts to making Pyongyang an untrustworthy supplier and partner for technical collaboration. As mentioned earlier in relation to Iranian reservations about the dependability of North Korean missile systems, sowing such mistrust can help discourage future purchases from – or collaboration with – Pyongyang. This should include increasing efforts to interdict shipments of weapons and materials, and could also include attempts to target North Korea’s procurement networks operating overseas, using some of the established extraterritorial tools targeted at customers’ programmes. Efforts could also be made to try to insert compromised technology into North Korea’s procure-to-supply networks, thus further undermining the credibility and reliability of North Korea as a supplier. Countries that are important suppliers of key technologies that North Korea may need for its missile and nuclear wares – namely, countries in North America, Europe and Asia – can play an important role in efforts to prevent North Korean procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 10: Carefully utilise unilateral counter-proliferation tools.&lt;/strong&gt; While the current political dynamics on the UNSC will likely preclude any further UNSC sanctions against North Korea (or its facilitators or customers) in the foreseeable future, individual governments should continue to sanction North Korean and related entities that facilitate North Korean proliferation, or target them with other unilateral tools. While unilateral sanctions technically create no obligations for compliance by entities outside the relevant country’s jurisdiction, their appearance on sanctions lists will – or at least should – trigger adverse media and other compliance-screening measures at financial institutions or companies proactively seeking to comply with export controls. In the case of the US in particular, the importance of its financial sector and the US dollar to global markets means that many financial institutions around the world screen against US sanctions lists even if they are under no domestic obligation to comply with them. Such designations can also help facilitate open source investigations or the sanctioning of these entities in other jurisdictions. Use of other elements of the unilateral toolset developed and deployed by the US in recent years – which includes civil asset forfeiture as well as other targeted efforts against specific entities overseas – may also be appropriate in certain cases. However, application of these powerful tools should be considered on a case-by-case basis due to the risks of political blowback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western governments enacted a sweeping array of sanctions, stringent export controls and other policy actions designed to stem the flow of critical technology – including drones, thermal cameras, industrial machinery, semiconductors and microelectronics – to the country’s armed forces and intelligence agencies. Faced with losing access to these essential supply lines, Russia adapted, rerouting trade flows through friendly jurisdictions and bordering countries, often using complex front-company networks to evade scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost overnight, countries with little history of microelectronics trade became hubs for Russia’s technology flows. For example, in 2022, Armenia’s microelectronics imports from the US and EU increased by over 500% and 200%, respectively, with most of these later re-exported to Russia. Similarly, Kazakhstan’s microelectronics exports to Russia increased from around $250,000 in 2021 to over $18 million in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other cases, Russia’s importers have appeared to hide in plain sight. Since the 2022 invasion, one of Russia’s largest microelectronics distributors – Compel JSC – seems to have continued moving tens of millions of dollars in critical components through the heart of Europe and Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data seen by RUSI, Nieuwsuur and ARD MONITOR confirms that Compel appears to have dozens of customers that are subject to sanctions for connections to Russia’s military-industrial complex. To date, however, Compel has only been sanctioned by the US and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TFCcXyv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ COMPEL JSC, Moscow, Russia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Compel JSC is one of Russia’s largest distributors of microelectronics, founded by Boris Rudyak in 1993. In July 2023, the US Treasury designated Compel for allegedly importing dual-use technology into Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Compel appears to operate procurement networks abroad that are seemingly run by Russian nationals in Europe and East Asia who are intimately linked to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-electronics-powerhouse&quot;&gt;An Electronics Powerhouse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time over the Kremlin on 25 December 1991, Boris Rudyak seems to have already had a long and storied career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting his professional journey as an apprentice at a vocational school in the Soviet Union’s first motor vehicle plant, Rudyak later found himself tending patients in a psychiatric hospital. As a resourceful man with many talents, he would later work for the fire brigade, as a watchman, as a cameraman, and even collecting nuts in a forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many other Russians whose lives had been broadly defined by the stultifying Soviet system, Rudyak’s big break was to come shortly after its dissolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before the Western-technology transfer control regime known as COCOM officially ended in 1994, Rudyak claims he was travelling to Singapore and stuffing suitcases with microelectronics for sale back home. In 1993, Rudyak officially registered Compel JSC, legitimately importing the sophisticated microelectronics that the Soviet Union was once forced to smuggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Vladimir Putin’s reign, Russia’s GDP rose rapidly, buoyed by surging oil exports and the dizzying rise in global oil prices. The 2008 recession and corresponding collapse in prices, however, sent the Russian economy into a tailspin. In October 2009, Rudyak delivered a presentation explaining how the Russian electronics industry waxed and waned with the fluctuations of the global oil market. Following the precipitous oil price collapse, Rudyak claimed that Russia’s microelectronics market contracted by 40%, leaving over a third of the market dominated by military and security customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this market volatility, Compel’s Russian business seems to have thrived. From 2019 to 2021, the company imported a mean annual average of $32.2 million in microelectronics and related items. In the first seven months of 2023 alone, Compel imported approximately $29 million dollars’ worth of components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia’s microelectronics imports entered the crosshairs of regulators after thousands of Western-designed and manufactured components were found inside the country’s weapons platforms. As a result, many of the world’s largest microelectronic component manufacturers – including Analog Devices, Microchip Technology, Murata Manufacturing, Nexperia, NXP Semiconductors, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments – terminated sales into Russia, and many also prohibited their distributors from selling into the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seemingly undeterred, Compel continued importing thousands of shipments of components manufactured by Analog Devices, Microchip Technology, Murata Manufacturing, Nexperia, NXP Semiconductors, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments. Compel’s product catalogues seem to have removed a couple of these suppliers, including Texas Instruments, Analog Devices and STMicroelectronics, since the US sanctioned the Russian company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-do-they-come-from&quot;&gt;Where Do They Come From?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the number of suppliers to Compel has dwindled since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Germany-based WWSemicon GmbH and Hong Kong-based Finder Technology continued shipping to Compel in 2023 and appear to have become the company’s largest suppliers, accounting for at least 65% of Compel’s imports since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian trade data indicates that before February 2022, Compel’s largest suppliers were WWSemicon GmbH, Finder Technology Ltd and the now-dissolved Compel International Oy, a possible affiliate company of Compel based in Finland. From January 2019 to February 2022, 98% of Compel International Oy and WWSemicon’s exports and 83% of Finder Technology’s exports were destined for Compel and Beliv LLC, another Rudyak company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ydijPBF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Compel’s annual imports and suppliers from 2019 to 2023.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Data seen by RUSI, Nieuwsuur and ARD MONITOR.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compel’s suppliers diversified in the lead-up to the invasion, seeming to peak at 40 companies in 2021. However, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the roster of suppliers shrunk drastically, with nearly all imports coming from only six companies. WWSemicon and Finder Technology were by far the largest, accounting for over 98% of imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite trade records showing that WWSemicon continued exporting millions of dollars’ worth of components to Compel as recently as July 2023, representatives for WWSemicon told Nieuwsuur they had stopped shipments to the company “long ago”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As sanctions and export controls have complicated Russian procurement efforts, microelectronics have increasingly been routed through hubs such as Hong Kong. To restrict Russia’s access to critical technologies, the US and UK have sanctioned several Hong Kong companies for supplying Russia’s defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, in June and July 2023, Finder Technology shipped over $1.1 million in microelectronics to Compel under nine HS codes identified in May by the US as “high priority items” for Russian weapons systems. These HS codes cover several categories of critical microelectronics, including processors, field-programmable gate arrays, tantalum capacitors, ceramic capacitors, amplifiers and memory modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finder Technology did not respond when contacted by Nieuwsuur and ARD MONITOR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From the outskirts of a residential neighbourhood in Munich, WWSemicon appears to have maintained exceptionally close ties with Compel for nearly 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5VKjpe7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wwsemicon-gmbh&quot;&gt;WWSemicon GmbH&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Boris Rudyak told Nieuwsuur that WWSemicon was “not part of the Compel network”, he claimed the companies engaged in “good business before the war”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, an analysis of trade data, corporate documents, social media and other records indicates that Compel and WWSemicon have maintained exceptionally close ties for nearly 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, WWSemicon was registered in 2005 by Russian nationals Oleg Shtots (AKA Alex Stotz) and Vladimir Avetisyan. Notably, Avetisyan is also the sole shareholder and general director of RBA-Management LLC in Russia, one of Compel’s founding shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost two decades after WWSemicon was founded, the company is now owned by several former Compel employees, including Boris Rudyak’s daughter, who worked for Compel from 2007 to 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another shareholder of the company listed their LinkedIn title as “lead developer” at Compel-SPB LLC – a company owned by Rudyak’s RBA-Group. Meanwhile, a third shareholder, who also manages the Slovakia-based WWSemicon branch, was referred to as Compel’s general director in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TQk7wIG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FINDER TECHNOLOGY LTD, Chai Wan, Hong Kong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Overlooking the waterfront of a Hong Kong suburb, Finder Technology has shipped millions of dollars’ worth of components to Compel, including various high-priority items for Russian weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finder Technology was co-founded in April 2005 by the same person that founded WWSemicon in Germany, Oleg Shtots. Hong Kong registry documents from 2019 reveal that Shtots used both Russian and German passports, and that same year, he began using the name “Alex Stotz” on Finder Technology’s corporate documents. Corporate documents from 2023 for Finder Technology still list Shtots as the sole shareholder of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3ZWnK5C.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An email for Oleg Shtots listed on a Russian-language German employment forum appears in the URL of a public Google Calendar for an “Alex Stotz”. The calendar blocks off “Electronica”, a trade event in Munich, and contains departure dates of Compel from the event. It also includes meetings labelled “Boris” during one of several apparent trips to Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with WWSemicon, Finder Technology’s employee base seems to include individuals affiliated with Compel. Russian court records reveal that, in 2017, Avetisyan – WWSemicon’s co-founder – led Finder Technology’s legal representative’s office in Russia, and another employee’s LinkedIn account states that until March 2022, they were also a purchasing manager for Compel and two US-based companies, Rapid GCS Inc and Real Time Components (RTC) Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stateside-suppliers-pre-invasion-rapid-gcs-and-rtc&quot;&gt;Stateside Suppliers Pre-invasion: Rapid GCS and RTC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While neither Rapid GCS nor RTC appears to have shipped to Russia since the 2022 invasion, both historically shipped millions of dollars in microelectronics and related components from Analog Devices, NXP Semiconductors, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments to Compel, Beliv and Dadjet LLC, the latter of which is also owned by Boris Rudyak. RTC’s shipments into Russia appear to have ceased in July 2020, but Rapid GCS continued its exports until February 2022 – the month of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both companies share a phone number and a New Jersey address, and Rapid GCS’s registered agent appears to operate an X account with the biography “Regional Purchasing Manager at Real Time Components (RTC/Compel)”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-do-they-go&quot;&gt;Where Do They Go?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many of Compel’s customers include commercial enterprises, data seen by RUSI, Nieuswsuur and ARD MONITOR reveals that the company has received thousands of payments from dozens of Russian companies sanctioned after the invasion began. Many of these companies have extensive links to the country’s defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several companies that were later sanctioned for being part of Russia’s defence industrial base made thousands of payments to Compel from January 2022 to January 2023, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Testkomplekt LLC, which is sanctioned by the US, the UK, Switzerland and Ukraine. Testkomplekt is also a key microelectronics supplier for Radiopriborsnab LLC, which is ultimately owned by subsidiaries of Rostec, the Russian state-owned defence industrial conglomerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Staut LLC, which is sanctioned by the US and UK for supplying export-controlled technology to the Russian defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;EuroMicroTech LLC (EMT), which is sanctioned by the US. EMT’s website features letters of gratitude for the “timely provision of items” from a Rostec subsidiary and a military facility founded in 2009 by the Russian Ministry of Defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;NIIIT LLC (AKA RIIT Ltd), which is sanctioned by the US. One of NIIIT’s founders was Ostec Enterprises Ltd, a semiconductor supplier for several Russian defence entities, including an alleged manufacturer of Kinzhal hypersonic missiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Specialized Devices and Systems CJSC (SPS), which is sanctioned by Ukraine, Switzerland and, most recently, the EU for facilitating a Netherlands-based sanctions evasion operation. Nieuwsuur confirms that SPS lists several EU-sanctioned Rostec subsidiaries as customers, and other reports claim that SPS is licensed by Russia’s Federal Security Bureau to supply Rostec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;EKB Neva LLC, which is sanctioned by the US and Ukraine and certified by the Russian government to supply Russian military end-users. In 2020, EKB’s director was arrested for allegedly forging certificates of Western microelectronics imported for military use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hiding-in-plain-sight&quot;&gt;Hiding in Plain Sight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many of the companies that have continued to import microelectronics, components and technology into Russia following the 2022 invasion, Compel appears to have been forced to reroute trade flows through jurisdictions like Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the movement of millions of dollars’ worth of components through Europe, even after the invasion, unfortunately highlights the ease with which some Russian companies have continued to procure technologies that could be used by the country’s military–industrial complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russia faces the prospect of a protracted conflict in Ukraine, the Kremlin is increasingly gearing up its economy for war. The Russian finance minister left little room for interpretation about Moscow’s priorities when he said in October 2023 that “the main emphasis is on ensuring [Russia’s] victory – the army, defence capability, armed forces, fighters – everything needed for the front, everything needed for victory is in the budget”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, with Russia diverting all possible financial and technical resources to support its war of aggression, Ukraine’s partners should ensure that Western technology and microelectronics are not in Russia’s arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the design of the sanctions packages imposed on Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the initial focus was on throwing the net as wide as possible. The aim was to impose restrictive measures on a broad range of financial and trade activities. However, following the early flurry of activity, attention has now shifted towards ensuring effective implementation and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over nearly two years, the RUSI-led European Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet) has highlighted the main structural challenges faced by EU member state national authorities, and businesses with sanctions responsibilities. It has also identified that all stakeholders – whether private sector actors seeking to improve their implementation or governments monitoring for circumvention and evasion – need better data. This would allow sanctions to be more effectively implemented, and circumvention and evasion more effectively tackled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To gain insights on this issue, the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies (CFCS) at RUSI hosted a roundtable discussion in Barcelona in November 2023, with the support of Dow Jones Risk &amp;amp; Compliance. The event gathered sanctions experts from the public and private sectors across different European jurisdictions to explore, under the Chatham House rule, the role of data in strengthening the implementation and enforcement of sanctions. This engagement was part of SIFMANet’s activities supported by the National Endowment for Democracy, and along with a video filmed on the day, this report presents the main findings from the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-need-for-data-to-support-sanctions-implementation&quot;&gt;The Need for Data to Support Sanctions Implementation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions used to be an isolated task within the compliance departments of financial institutions, whose primary responsibility consisted of screening sanctions lists to check for individual and entity name matches with their client base and transaction activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the workshop, private sector representatives noted that this modus operandi started to change following the introduction in 2014 of sanctions against Russia, in response to the Kremlin’s annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine. This programme introduced sector-specific sanctions, which for the first time required financial institutions – and others from the private sector such as oil services companies – to have a deeper understanding of their clients and, critically, their activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This task demanded increased resources from these elements of the private sector, as well as their clients, to obtain and process data that was far more complex than merely checking for sanctions-list name matches. Fast forward to February 2022 and the sanctions that followed Russia’s full-scale invasion dramatically increased this burden and introduced complex sanctions compliance to a large number of economic operators that had never been exposed in this way before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, businesses place significant demands on national competent authorities to assist with identifying where they require licences to continue their operations, but also information regarding possible entities engaged in sanctioned activities, something that is not yet widely available from the typical vendors of sanctions screening services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from both governments and the private sector clearly articulated in the workshop that if sanctions are to be implemented effectively by the private sector, placed on the frontline by their governments, then a significant improvement in data is required. There was also strong agreement that banks should not be left to carry this burden on their own. Governments must clearly make those businesses engaging in trade exposed to sanctions aware of their responsibilities and must either have proper internal sanctions-monitoring controls or access to third-party tools that can provide them with the necessary compliance capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the purpose of the workshop was to focus specifically on data, the next section addresses specific tactical data that the private sector could leverage to improve its sanctions compliance, and how governments can use data to facilitate better private sector implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-data-is-helpful-for-implementing-sanctions&quot;&gt;What Data is Helpful for Implementing Sanctions?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of data for improved sanctions effectiveness falls into two parts: data used to support implementation by EU member states’ banks and businesses; and data (mainly related to trade) used to identify sanctions circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;improved-implementation&quot;&gt;Improved Implementation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For banks and businesses operating in the EU, data plays two roles: first, it facilitates better identification of sanctioned individuals and their assets; and second, it clarifies where clients might be involved in restricted sectors or activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beneficial Ownership Registries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beneficial ownership registries are useful sources of data on companies and their ownership structure and related natural persons involved in them. However, both public and private sector participants noted that registers, if accessible, often do not hold the same type of information in each country, they do not always hold reliable and updated information, and they are at times only accessible in certain languages. In addition, some jurisdictions have business registries that require subscriptions and have limited financial intelligence on, for example, companies’ financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants defined public access to beneficial ownership registers as a crucial element for sanctions implementation and they regarded the ruling from the November 2022 European Court of Justice as a new and troubling challenge. A representative from the Spanish Treasury explained that one of the goals of the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the EU is to harmonise information across EU registries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Client Documentation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the lack of publicly available and machine-readable data, trying to map client activities involving Russia’s neighbouring countries and trading partners demands that the private sector devote substantial amounts of manual labour to check information submitted by clients on their transactions. Businesses hold the deepest knowledge of the sector in which they operate and of their own activities. So, the data they provide is essential. However, representatives from financial institutions noted that it is increasingly difficult to rely on information submitted by clients given that, as elaborated below, it may be subject to a lack of knowledge on the part of their clients or to obfuscation tactics used by those seeking to evade sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses are not only trading in goods subject to sanctions, but also technical services, and many do not know the extent of their sanctions obligations. An example shared by a participant described that providing crew members for a vessel carrying Russian oil could fall under EU prohibitions, but many businesses do not know this, and rely on financial institutions to inform them that such activity is prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, participants noted that they are increasingly holding conversations with clients regarding suspicions of document forgery. Financial institutions explained that the supporting information provided to justify the submitted documentation is often useful to confirm or reject their suspicions. But again, this work creates a significant extra burden on the financial institutions’ sanctions compliance community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To effectively manage their monitoring burden, many financial institutions are thus following a risk-based approach. If a financial institution sees a client trading with a third country with which it has maintained trade relations in the past, then it can lower manual effort. On the contrary, if the business relationship was recently established or has now shifted to include controlled goods, the financial institution will increase the manual work required to check the transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While financial institutions monitor clients across all sectors, key corporates may serve as the most useful and expert sources of data. These include shipping companies, logistics firms and airlines. These businesses hold the raw data required to check goods that banks do not have access to, such as the bill of lading, the itinerary of vessels or identity location spoofing. The top companies in these sectors are screening these elements, but with a lower level of scrutiny than banks would like them to for sanctions-compliance purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, better data is required if the private sector is to be fully empowered to play its role on the frontline of sanctions implementation. As the complexity of sanctions has grown, the provision of and access to data has lagged. New tools need to be developed by those companies with expertise in providing data services; and governments need to provide access to additional sources of data that can enhance the effectiveness of the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;identifying-circumvention&quot;&gt;Identifying Circumvention&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as facilitating improved implementation, data – particularly trade data – can be used by governments to identify changes in trade flows that may be indicative of emerging sanctions circumvention routes used by Russia to procure the key goods it requires for its military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trade Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public and private sector representatives acknowledged their initial positive assessment of the reported declines in their jurisdictions’ direct trade with Russia. This assessment changed once they identified the increasing exports – including of controlled and banned goods – to third countries regarded as high-risk for circumvention. This indicated that their trade with Russia continued, albeit indirectly. To properly observe and understand the specific transactions and flows, and the extent to which they represent sanctions circumvention, authorities and the private sector point to various data points to strengthen their sanctions compliance mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants noted the difficulty of proving that goods exported from a specific jurisdiction to a third country are then re-exported to Russia through generic import/export trade data. Sources such as UN COMTRADE – described as not particularly user-friendly – or national customs data can serve as a good guide to identify suspicious trade flows, but do not provide sufficiently deep insights. A participant provided a visual example in which a member state exported apples to a third country, and the third country exported apples to Russia. The flow of apples can be identified in the member state’s national customs data but unless the items are specifically identified, it is hard to prove that it is the self- same apples that enter Russia. Participants added that the customs data from Russia and certain third countries may be a useful starting point but cannot be trusted and often entail language translation complications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compensate for this lack of clarity, tools such as Import/Export Genius provide transaction-level tracking data, identify where a product was produced, and to where it was shipped. Authorities and financial institutions can use this data to then query companies involved on whether sanctions are being breached. A key piece of information employed in trade is Harmonised System (HS) codes. These describe the nature of a product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HS codes differ across jurisdictions, as countries incorporate additional digits to the six-digit HS codes for further classification. For example, in the EU they are known as TARIC codes and in the US they are HTS codes. This creates divergences among HS codes, which authorities and businesses must understand. HS codes are particularly useful to screen for dual-use goods. However, participants highlighted that not all dual-use goods have HS codes. This a critical challenge as the technical descriptions of HS codes in regulations often create confusion, which increases cost of compliance for businesses that must manually check them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, authorities and financial institutions have detected that some businesses will alter the HS codes of goods to pass them off as products not subject to prohibitions. This is related to the document forgery issue that is increasingly spotted by financial institutions in the information provided by clients. Participants explained that when a bank is financing trade through letters of credit, they will have more information on the operation than if the trade is conducted via “open account” through which their access to data is limited to just seeing the financial transaction. This makes it harder to spot irregularities. As one participant noted, “the task now consists of screening against information that is not there”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collection of trade data is essential for the private sector to effectively implement sanctions and detect circumvention. However, trade data also plays a key role in the diplomatic efforts of authorities. The EU both requests trade data from third countries and also asks them to validate its own perspective on the third country’s trading activity, to assess their involvement in circumvention. Suspicious trade flows and confirmed circumvention activities identified through the aforementioned analysis of trade data by EU operators can be leveraged by authorities from sanctions-imposing countries to deter third countries from facilitating circumvention through their jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the roundtable, participants also pointed to other data sources that would be useful for authorities and businesses to exploit and process to enhance their investigations and compliance systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, for individual financial transactions, Business Identifier Codes (BIC) are well-known sources of data used for addressing SWIFT messages, routing business transactions and identifying business parties, but the screening of less common items can also provide valuable information. One such example is screening IP addresses that may help identify businesses operating in high-risk jurisdictions. IP addresses can be disguised through VPNs, but their usage can be detected and as a result trigger a red flag to demand enhanced due diligence. As private sector participants noted, screening IP addresses is an increasingly common practice by larger financial institutions and e-commerce firms to block transactions from sanctioned jurisdictions and/or flag transactions for further scrutiny. They noted that national competent authorities could enhance the effectiveness of private sector sanctions implementation by providing this information in sanctions designations as and when available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to leverage such additional data points to support sanctions implementation highlights the added complexity of the post-2022 regimes. Using these data sources to triangulate and identify evasion activity demands a considerable degree of manual work to check the entities involved and their activities. Yet, despite the resources required, going beyond basic due diligence and conducting open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysis must now be a critical component of sanctions implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regards to maritime transport, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) required by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)to locate vessels was also noted by both public and private sector participants as providing valuable data. Even though the AIS can be turned off, this should trigger a red flag in due diligence systems. AIS will also indicate changes in the draft of the vessel, which might reveal that transhipments took place due to a change in the vessel’s cargo. This can be complemented with the use of satellite imagery. Similarly, IMO identification numbers of designated vessels are key pieces of data that institutions should have at their disposal to monitor their activity such as reflagging or change of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector actors, particularly financial institutions that can afford to make such investments, are increasingly developing OSINT capabilities as they can provide invaluable data on clients, their partners and their activities. The information can be openly shared with authorities and other private institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;persisting-challenges&quot;&gt;Persisting Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While available circumvention routes are increasingly limited, participants noted that supply chains are getting more layered with complex multi-jurisdiction corporate structures and operators increasingly struggling to control what is happening along a particular route. The manual work required to effectively obtain and screen the necessary data is a cumbersome burden for the private sector and the task of identifying companies owned or controlled by sanctioned individuals in the supply chain is challenging. Ownership data is relatively straightforward when it is publicly available – which, as indicated above, is not always the case – but determining “control” is a more difficult task, given that the necessary information might not be public and the concept of “control” can be judgemental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In certain areas, participants explained that they face the challenge of combining contradictory datasets. For instance, when monitoring to confirm that a transaction was done below the oil price cap, both authorities and businesses must check data from shipping companies and customs pricing data, which do not always match. This intense screening is conducted for each individual transaction but if the goal is to disrupt the trade of oil or battlefield items before it happens, operators would need to develop foresight by identifying patterns and incorporate these mapping activities into their compliance procedures to anticipate potential evasion transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further complication to these mapping efforts and the blocking of suspicious transactions is the decoupled nature of payment flows from their related trade flows. While payments are flowing between two jurisdictions, goods may be produced and transported from factories in third countries. For example, a Swedish entity can have a Dutch bank account, receive the payment from a shell company in Turkey, and ship controlled goods from Malaysia via a third country to Russia. Financial institutions emphasised that it is very challenging to block such transactions as they are often unaware of the trade flow connected with the payment, a trade flow involving countries outside the Western sanctions regime and thus not subject to local control. Furthermore, even if (in this case) the Turkish shell company is identified as facilitating sanctioned trade, a new shell company can easily be established in its place elsewhere with no transaction history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible way of addressing this challenge, raised by finance experts at the roundtable, is to identify pinch points in the payment flows, for example by making more use of SWIFT messaging data by mandating greater use of currently discretionary fields, to help illuminate payments related to circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing burden placed on the private sector led participants to express their concern over the lack of clarity regarding the extent of their compliance obligations to confirm there is no risk of sanctions violation or circumvention. They have significantly increased their sanctions-dedicated resources and tools but at some point they have to make a judgement as to how far their due diligence obligations extend. Participants explained that investigations had traditionally been limited to checking two levels of ownership, but recent investigations have gone down many more levels of ownership to identify the real individual controlling an entity. Private sector representatives added that this may clash with the expectations of regulators, which will also differ across the jurisdictions they operate in. Even minute differences will be immense for internationally operating institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clear message from participants was that many businesses lack experience regarding the availability and use of the data sources discussed at the workshop. This often means they resort to third-party data providers and vendors. These services ease the burden on businesses, but authorities have raised concerns of an over-reliance on these services without understanding how the tools they provide work. Participating authorities explained that their inspections showed that many businesses do not properly detect the right matches after inputting the data provided into their systems, and some screening systems struggle with fuzzy searches with multiple options per identifier. These fuzzy searches are themselves the outcome of vast discrepancies across sanctions lists, further complicating compliance tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the heavy burden imposed on the private sector is met with a lack of incentives to actually comply with sanctions obligations. First, participants noted that HS codes are used for tax purposes, so businesses are not always interested in reporting them accurately. Furthermore, for intentional circumvention schemes, public and private sector representatives agreed that the consequences of breaching sanctions at the moment are not enough to deter violations, both in terms of low financial penalties but also low chances of detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is partly related to the insufficient level of information exchanged within the EU, a major impediment to sanctions investigations and enforcement. Currently, many investigations are crippled when a national competent authority requests information from a member state where sanctions violations are not yet criminalised. A participant suggested that to improve the sharing of data and avoid duplication, the EU needs a sanctions-related institution such as OLAF, which is currently the only agency that coordinates member states regarding imports and exports. Regional initiatives for enhanced information-sharing within the EU are happening in areas such as the Baltic states, but this should be happening across the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one workshop participant noted, a key feature of the current sanctions regimes against Russia is that policymakers are expecting sanctions to achieve far more today than has been expected of sanctions regimes in the past, and governments’ messaging often seems to expect companies to screen transactions against non-existing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core pillar of the effectiveness of the current sanctions implementation and enforcement landscape is the availability, accessibility and quality of data. During the workshop, participants proposed a series of valuable sources of data for authorities and businesses to strengthen their investigations and compliance mechanisms. However, these data sources pose a series of challenges in themselves, which the EU must take measures to mitigate in order to improve the sanctions efforts across the public and private sectors. The importance of this is clear. Data can not only support better implementation of sanctions by EU member states and their financial institutions and businesses, it can also provide a strong basis from which to engage in dialogue with third countries that are vulnerable to – or indeed are already facilitating – sanctions circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a focus on how governments can support the private sector in achieving their goals, some specific recommendations emerged from the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarity of obligations.&lt;/strong&gt; Supervisors need to clarify what is required of the private sector. Too often requirements and expectations are ambiguous and lack specificity. Although ambiguity may be a means by which governments can ensure businesses do not merely restrict their compliance obligations to the bare minimum, the uncertainty faced in the private sector on whether they have done enough for a single transaction leads to inefficient responses, the investment of extensive (potentially unnecessary) resources and manual work, and economic costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced awareness in the private sector.&lt;/strong&gt; Businesses must expand their understanding of the steps needed to conduct sanctions due diligence on clients, their trade partners, controlled products and sectoral risks. Governments must support this education process by providing briefings and access to new data sources that can facilitate sanctions implementation. As one participant noted, screening for “persons connected with Russia” is just not possible – or desirable; and placing the burden of policing businesses entirely on the banking sector is not efficient. Key industry sectors such as shipping and logistics must be made to feel equally responsible and empowered.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harmonisation and consistency are key.&lt;/strong&gt; Small inconsistencies in sanctions interpretations by authorities can have a significant impact on the private sector. For example, within the EU, the understanding of ownership and control differs across member states and, in consequence, guidance for businesses operating in several jurisdictions varies. Likewise, the quality and nature of information found in national beneficial ownership registers varies, is often not updated, is in different languages, and is not publicly available. Among the sanctions coalition, key identifiers such as HS codes also differ and alignment in this regard would facilitate the tasks of both authorities and the private sector. More broadly, the quality of trade data is lacking and should likewise be presented in a harmonised manner as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimising use of trade data.&lt;/strong&gt; First, trade data from EU member states can be trusted and should be the foundation of trade-related sanctions implementation. EU member state capacity in this field varies – development of an EU member state sanctions trade data expert working group could enhance the use of this data to identify EU-based weaknesses. Second, trade data should continue to be used to engage with third countries to ensure common understanding of the key items that are subject to restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve EU-wide trade data sharing.&lt;/strong&gt; The EU should create an EU sanctions-related information-sharing mechanism similar to OLAF to ensure consistent interpretation of sanctions (particularly related to trade).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consolidation must continue.&lt;/strong&gt; The consolidation of regulations is essential for businesses with insufficient experience to navigate complex EU legislation. Furthermore, a consolidated – and more closely aligned – list of sanctioned individuals and entities from the international sanctions coalition would facilitate the task of businesses that aim to be compliant across all regimes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make greater use of SWIFT data.&lt;/strong&gt; Tackling circumvention trade flows would benefit from identifying pinch points in the flow of payments, for example by making more use of SWIFT messaging data by mandating greater use of currently discretionary fields, to help illuminate payments related to circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technological advancements.&lt;/strong&gt; The current level of manual work required to fulfil sanctions compliance obligations is an unsustainable burden on the private sector. Greater attention should be placed on developing tools that will facilitate the effective compliance of businesses. For example, a participant noted Singapore’s introduction of blockchain to track payments and trade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, data – in all its forms – is emerging as a key tool in enhancing the effectiveness of sanctions implementation against Russia. Yet, the provision and availability of data by governments to the private sector has lagged the growth in complexity of sanctions. Accessible data has the potential to enhance the ability of financial institutions and businesses across the EU to be fully empowered to correctly identify entities, industry sectors, activities and specific goods that should be blocked. It can further assist with the identification of circumvention activity and underpin diplomatic engagement with third countries. The challenge ahead is to enhance the quality and accessibility of these data sources to ensure the impact needed to further restrict the funding and resourcing of the Russian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 10 years, cybercrime has entered the realm of national security. This shift has been driven by one type of cybercrime in particular – ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging from the Russian cyber-criminal ecosystem in the early 2010s, ransomware today is a highly disruptive form of cybercrime that encompasses a range of tactics and techniques designed to extort ransoms from individuals, businesses and even governments. Although cyber fraud likely affects more individual UK citizens on a personal level and generates greater economic losses, ransomware is a particularly acute threat to the UK because of its ability to cause harm to nationally important services – ranging from the ability of local councils to provide social care or ensure your bins are collected to the provision of essential healthcare services. Put simply, ransomware can (and does) ruin people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware has proven to be highly lucrative for many of the criminals that participate, with UK victims paying an average ransom payment of £1.6 million in 2023 according to one survey. Large profit margins have enabled ransomware operators to reinvest revenues, expand their capabilities, and largely stay ahead of cyber defenders and law enforcement. Although the National Crime Agency (NCA) and its international counterparts have had some tactical successes against the ransomware ecosystem, absent a major shift in the cost–benefit calculus of ransomware operators, the next 10 years of cybercrime will likely continue to be dominated by this pernicious form of offending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-evolution-of-ransomware-from-spray-and-pray-to-organised-cybercrime&quot;&gt;The Evolution of Ransomware: From “Spray and Pray” to Organised Cybercrime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although ransomware has existed in some form since the 1990s, it was largely non-viable as a profitable cybercrime until the emergence of cryptocurrency in the late 2010s, which enabled cybercriminals to monetise ransomware while maintaining a degree of anonymity. In 2013, ransomware was characterised by the so-called “spray and pray” model, which targeted a large number of individual users. These operations had low yields with uniformly priced ransoms for all victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, from 2016 onwards, ransomware began to evolve into the form that is dominant today. Ransomware operators moved away from the “spray and pray” model and started to focus on organisations rather than individuals, using tactics to deploy ransomware to thousands of computers within a single organisation to increase their leverage and therefore demand higher ransoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, two important tactical modifications emerged that helped ransomware operators extort higher payments at greater scale. First, they became more purposeful in their victim selection. Some developed so-called “big game hunting” ransomware operations, which involves prioritising larger and therefore more lucrative victims; others focused on targeting critical services and organisations that rely on constant delivery of operations, such as healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the criminals behind the Maze ransomware operation started to steal as well as encrypt victims’ data. Other ransomware threat actors swiftly followed suit and over the last few years coercion tactics have continued to evolve, with dedicated data leak sites, leaks to journalists and harassment of employees and clients all employed as parts of efforts to make victims pay. A new cyber extortion collective made up mostly of English-speaking young men has even threatened physical violence against its victims. Our own research on ransomware harms, which is based on interviews with UK victims of ransomware, found examples of harassment of school children, healthcare patients and other vulnerable groups following ransomware incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the ransomware ecosystem resembles something more like a professionalised industry than a ragtag network mostly active on dark web forums and marketplaces. This is not just because of the revenues generated by ransomware (which are believed to run into hundreds of millions of dollars for the most successful gangs), but also because of the growing levels of professionalisation that have developed within the ecosystem. The ransomware-as-a-service business model has enabled the specialisation of roles within ransomware operations, allowing ransomware developers to recruit affiliates who conduct operations for a cut of the profits. Ransomware is also supported by the broader cybercrime-as-a-service ecosystem, particularly services and marketplaces that specialise in obtaining and selling access to victim networks (known as initial access brokers) or monetising and laundering the proceeds of ransomware. The service-driven cyber-criminal economy enables ransomware threat actors to streamline their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The reality for many ransomware victims is that government support is likely to be very limited, with the accessible response ecosystem largely privatised&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, ransomware threat actors have developed structures more like legitimate businesses than traditional organised crime groups. The group behind the now defunct Conti ransomware operation, for instance, at one point employed between 65 and 100 salaried staff, with defined roles, HR staff and employment policies. The profitability of ransomware can make this extremely attractive, pulling more would-be cyber-criminals into the ecosystem. Ransomware therefore represents a form of organised crime that is in keeping with modern digital economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing the impact of ransomware on the UK specifically is challenging. Since 2019, 2,607 ransomware incidents have been reported to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). However, the ICO does not collect data or produce intelligence on the threat or financial impact of ransomware. Reporting to Action Fraud is believed to be considerably lower – the NCA assesses that less than 10% of ransomware incidents are reported to law enforcement. However, prominent attacks against UK businesses and critical national infrastructure providers emphasise the threat of ransomware to UK’s economy, national security and society. In 2023 alone, ransomware has disrupted the Royal Mail, one of the largest providers of outsourced services for the UK government, schools and an NHS Trust. A ransomware attack was also blamed for the permanent closure of one of the UK’s largest privately-owned logistics providers, KNP Logistics Groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-daunting-21st-century-challenge&quot;&gt;A Daunting 21st-Century Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergence of contemporary organised cybercrime as a national security dilemma presents a serious challenge for the UK’s law enforcement community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dilemma is exacerbated by a toxic combination of geopolitics and the double-edged sword presented by technological advancement. The concentration of ransomware operators in “permissive” jurisdictions with whom UK relations are relatively poor – most notably Russia – means that law enforcement’s capacity to arrest or interfere with many threat actors is limited. While a Russian cyber-criminal stated in an interview that their biggest concern was the prospect of Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and Western law enforcement collaboration, this seems unlikely to materialise at the time of writing. As recently emphasised by NCA Director-General Graeme Biggar at RUSI, serious and organised crime has become more global and sophisticated, straddling the “real” and “virtual” worlds. Ransomware is – unfortunately – a perfect illustration of this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s approach to the ransomware dilemma can be described, in part, as characterised by pragmatism. This is not to be confused with defeatism. Where possible, the National Crime Agency has collaborated with international partners on arrests of ransomware operators and affiliates outside of Russia. The UK’s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation has also recently joined forces with the US’s Office of Foreign Assets Control to sanction known ransomware operators, representing both a form of “naming and shaming” and an effort to limit specific cyber-criminals’ ability to monetise ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aligning with a pragmatic approach to “resiliency” that underpins the National Cyber Security Strategy, the UK’s public sector cyber response ecosystem has increasingly focused on reducing the ransomware threat and supporting victims. This ecosystem includes the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the NCA, Regional Organised Crime Units and local police. Victim support is triaged through the Incident Response Framework, with technical incident support tightly rationed and restricted to organisations with the greatest national security and economic impact. A number of victims may receive support in the form of incident response coordination and advice from NCSC and/or NCA liaisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the reality for many ransomware victims is that government support is likely to be very limited, with the accessible response ecosystem largely privatised. A ransomware victim organisation may, variously, draw upon the support of firms offering incident response, ransom negotiation, external counsel and public-relations management. Organisations either pay for these services themselves or draw on cyber insurance policies. However, the recent development that some sectors – including operators of critical national infrastructure – may be uninsurable by virtue of their sector should be cause for alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Given the absence of easy solutions, it is time to talk more actively about ransomware and organised cybercrime with the public at large&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of triaging and general reliance on private sector incident response services is a pragmatic approach amid current economic realities; it would be impossible for the current public-sector response ecosystem to scale sufficiently to serve as a “blue light” cyber response service. However, the quality of incident response matters. The NCSC’s assured cyber incident response schemes are a positive step toward promoting best practices to encourage optimum outcomes for victims of ransomware and other cyber incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-should-we-do-next&quot;&gt;What Should We Do Next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We write this with a degree of weariness. As active researchers in this space, we have talked, researched and written about ransomware for countless hours. Ransomware’s prominence as a cybercrime and national security threat means that this issue has consistently been at the forefront of our recent work. The UK government has also been actively talking about the issue, for instance, with the conducting of an internal “ransomware sprint”, the attendance of high-level meetings (and signing of agreements) with like-minded international partners, and the issuance of calls for evidence by Parliamentary Committees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, given the absence of easy solutions, it is time to talk more actively about ransomware and organised cybercrime with the public at large. In a liberal democratic society, a serious societal-level threat merits mature and considered conversations in a range of accessible forums. Ransomware arguably first emerged into the UK-wide conscience in 2017, with the WannaCry ransomware attack’s impact on some NHS Trusts serving as a pronounced indication of ransomware’s capacity to disrupt core societal services. After extolling that everyone had a responsibility for cyber security, Jeremy Hunt and Theresa May were given a reprieve with Marcus Hutchin’s kill-switch. But arguably the first significant opportunity for a proper and sustained national conversation was bypassed. Likewise, pronounced disruptions at local levels – for instance, Hackney, Redcar and Cleveland, and Gloucester City councils – have not ushered in focused conversations at a national level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such conversations could include more candid detail about the government’s place and role in the fight against this threat, in both preventative and reactive terms. Given financial and resource constraints, it is unlikely that the UK will significantly expand its technical response support for victims. But this should be conveyed to the public clearly and candidly. Recent RUSI research has highlighted a disconcerting degree of ambiguity and confusion among the public and ransomware victims about the role of government and law enforcement in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the question of how the UK should employ offensive cyber capabilities against the ransomware ecosystem. At the launch of the UK National Cyber Force (NCF) in 2020, the UK government identified organised cyber-criminals as a potential target for offensive cyber operations. In 2022, then GCHQ Director Jeremy Fleming suggested that the NCF was now actively targeting ransomware threat actors. Given that UK intelligences agencies have been able to disrupt the online activities of international terrorist organisations – and publicly disclose elements of this interference – there is a case for more public debate about the purpose and effectiveness of these operations. However, as the US experience with using offensive cyber operations against ransomware has highlighted, such operations may have a limited effect while the business model remains intact, and should be seen as complementary rather than a replacement for a strategy that focuses on fundamentally changing the cost-benefit calculus of the perpetrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future trajectory of ransomware is not clear. Arguably, this form of organised cybercrime has not yet reached saturation point. While some ransomware operators have dispersed following law enforcement activity, others have emerged. Operators continue to diversify their strategies to put maximum pressure on victim organisations and adapt to improved cyber security practices among their targets (for instance, viable backups).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, further growth and evolution of this threat should be anticipated. While it is not possible to speculate precisely on how ransomware will evolve, the UK and like-minded partners should anticipate turbulence, continue to raise their cyber resilience, and focus on ways to make life much more difficult for the criminals that perpetuate it.&lt;/p&gt;
