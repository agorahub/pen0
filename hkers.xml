The two countries have so far eschewed a formal alliance, but they share deep military ties centering on arms sales and joint military exercises.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Russian arms sales to China have been invaluable to China’s efforts to rapidly modernize the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Joint military exercises have likewise aided the PLA and offered Beijing a suite of other benefits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet military ties between Beijing and Moscow are not without considerable hiccups. China’s repeated theft of Russian technology is a major sore spot, and arms sales are becoming a less important focal point of the broader bilateral relationship. With respect to joint exercises, shifting power dynamics between China and Russia are upsetting the status quo with mixed results for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-aid-and-arms-sales&quot;&gt;Military Aid and Arms Sales&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the decades, cooperation on military technology has at times been an important and symbolic element of China-Russia relations. Politically, Russian military aid and arms sales have helped undergird the broader diplomatic relationship. Militarily, arms sales have provided the PLA with equipment that it struggled to produce on its own, like advanced aircraft, engines, and air defense systems. However, China has repeatedly stolen Russian technology and know-how, creating friction between Beijing and Moscow. Going forward, arms sales could become a less important area of the relationship or even become a point of contention as China advances and competes with Russia in the global arms industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ebb-and-flow-of-russian-military-aid-and-arms-sales&quot;&gt;The Ebb and Flow of Russian Military Aid and Arms Sales&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military aid and arms sales played a major role in cementing ties between the newly founded People’s Republic of China and the Soviet Union. After entering the Korean War in October 1950, China suffered heavy losses and turned to the Soviets for aid. In October 1951, Moscow agreed to provide massive amounts of equipment and assistance from Soviet experts. Soviet aid included around 700 MiG-15 fighter jets and 150 Tu-2 light bombers and effectively tripled the size of China’s air force fleet. In total, Chinese historical data suggests the Soviets provided the equivalent of $1.5–2 billion worth of aid during the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet Union also abetted China’s nuclear development, for both civilian and military purposes. Soviet aid included training Chinese scientists, supporting China’s weapons-grade uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing, and assisting with warhead design and production and missile technologies. The Soviets, however, stopped short of directly providing China with nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This massive influx of Soviet aid catalyzed China’s indigenous weapons production. Moscow encouraged and assisted Chinese production through licensing and technical support, and by 1956 China was producing the J-4, its first indigenous combat aircraft modeled on the Soviet MiG-17. China likewise leveraged Russian aid to eventually develop its first successful atomic bomb by 1964.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this military cooperation did not last. By 1960, ideological and political differences resulted in the Sino-Soviet Split, which effectively lasted until the normalization of relations in 1989. During this period, the two countries ceased virtually all forms of military aid and arms sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hW6jzwT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Chinese Arms Purchases from the Soviet Union/Russia (1950-2021)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the resumption of normal relations between Beijing and Moscow in 1989, arms sales again played a major role in strengthening political ties between the two sides. The Soviet Union was one of the only major arms-producing countries willing to sell weapons to China after the deadly crackdown on protestors in Tiananmen Square in 1989, which left Beijing an international pariah. The benefits were not one-sided. Chinese arms purchases were a lifeline for Russia’s defense industry in the wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian arms sales to China burgeoned in the 1990s and early 2000s. Some of the most big-ticket purchases were of Russian fighter aircraft. According to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), between 1990 and 2005 China placed several orders for some 270 Su-27 and Su-30 fighters at a cost of approximately $10-11 billion. In the years following the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis — during which China’s navy was outmatched by U.S. naval forces in the region — Beijing ordered eight Russian Kilo-class diesel-powered submarines and four Sovremenny-class destroyers. China also bought thousands of missiles and several S-300 surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, among other equipment. Altogether, between 1990 and 2005, China purchased more than 83 percent of its arms imports from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the 1950s, this influx of major weapons systems in the 1990s and 2000s significantly aided the PLA by filling modernization gaps. Russia’s willingness to license production rights to China catalyzed the development of China’s own defense industry. By selling China kits of Russian aircraft parts, Chinese engineers gained manufacturing experience, which aided China in developing indigenous designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;problems-in-the-china-russia-arms-trade-relationship&quot;&gt;Problems in the China-Russia Arms Trade Relationship&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a flurry of orders, Chinese arms purchases from Russia slowed to a trickle in the late 2000s. China’s overall arms imports were down 30 percent during the 2007-2021 period compared to 1992-2006. Declining orders from Russia drove much of this fall. China has procured around 71 percent of its arms imports from Russia since 2007 — a notable drop from 84 percent during the previous 15-year period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decline is partly the result of growing frustration with China’s repeated theft of Russian military technology and intellectual property through espionage and hacks. According to ChinaPower analysis, there have been at least 17 cases of Chinese espionage and hacking to steal Russian military technology during the last two decades. China has most heavily targeted Russian aerospace technologies. In 2004 alone, three court cases saw seven Russians convicted of providing China with information on Russian airplane and satellite technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Espionage and hacks are only part of the story. China has frequently breached agreements with Russian arms suppliers by reverse-engineering Russian equipment to produce its own. China copied Russian Su-27 fighters to develop its J-11 fighter and it reverse-engineered S-300 SAM systems to produce its HQ-9 SAM systems. This has not gone unnoticed in Moscow. In 2019, Russian state-owned defense firm Rostec claimed that there had been 500 cases of unauthorized copying of its equipment in the preceding 17 years. In a rare move, the company publicly criticized China, stating that “‘China alone has copied aircraft engines, Sukhoi planes, deck jets, air defense systems, portable air defense missiles, and analogs of the Pantsir medium-range surface-to-air systems.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Timeline of Chinese Espionage and Technology Theft against Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relative decline in Russian arms sales to China is also largely due to China’s shrinking reliance on foreign-made equipment. Decades of growing defense spending and intensive efforts to modernize its defense industry have rendered China increasingly capable of producing its own advanced fighter jets, naval vessels, and other equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China does notably still depend on Russian-made engines for many PLA aircraft. Over the last five years (2017-2021), aircraft engines accounted for more than 54 percent of China’s arms imports (by value), with the overwhelming majority coming from Russia. Some of China’s Chengdu J-20 stealth fighters are equipped with Russian Saturn AL-31 engines and versions of China’s developmental Shenyang J-35/FC-31 jet fighter have used Russian RD-93 engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WefUeoW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Recent Chinese Orders of Russian Aircraft Engines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China appears to be making headway toward replacing Russian engines. A domestically built WS-10C engine is reportedly being used in variants of the J-20, and new variants of the J-35/FC-31 are likely to be outfitted with Chinese WS-13E engines. Over the next decade, both planes are expected to feature more advanced Chinese-made engines, including the WS-15 and WS-19. China also aims to phase out the Russian Soloviev D-30KP-2 currently powering China’s Y-20 large transport aircraft and H-6K bombers and replace them with Chinese WS-18 engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-future-of-russian-arms-sales-to-china&quot;&gt;The Future of Russian Arms Sales to China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, several factors could render arms trade a source of contention and competition, rather than a platform for cooperation. The Chinese defense industry’s continued efforts toward self-reliance could result in the evaporation of Chinese arms purchases from Russia altogether. There has already been a marked slowdown in recent years. China last purchased military equipment (two orders of Mi-17 transport helicopters) from Russia in 2019 — a far cry from earlier years when China placed more than a dozen orders in a single year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if China does continue to purchase certain items, Russia may face challenges in supplying them. In 2020, Russia delayed delivery of its highly advanced S-400 SAM system to China, citing the Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse. However, the move was seen by some as a diplomatic move by Moscow to avoid angering India — Russia’s top arms buyer — amid heightened tensions and border skirmishes between China and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine could further inhibit Russia from delivering orders to China. After Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014, international sanctions on Russia disrupted Russia’s ability to deliver certain equipment to Vietnam, one of Russia’s top arm export markets. The severe sanctions placed on Russia in response to its 2022 invasion of Ukraine could further disrupt the Russian defense industry and limit its ability to fulfill large orders to China or other customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if China pushes to establish itself as a more dominant player in the global arms market, it could put significant pressure on the broader China-Russia relationship. Russia’s prominence in the global arms market has already declined steeply. In 2021, Russian arms exports plunged to 11 percent of the global total — the lowest point in decades and a steep fall from a high of 32 percent in 2002. So far, China has not made major gains in capturing global market share due to steep competition from more established actors, including the United States and Russia. Nevertheless, China may be able to use Russia’s war in Ukraine to make marginal gains in regions like the Middle East and North Africa. In the long-term, Beijing could become a more attractive arms supplier as developing countries look to diversify their suppliers away from just Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nBm9tcO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Share of Global Arm Sales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, arms sales will likely remain a slightly diminished but positive element of the relationship. As China’s capabilities and influence grow, however, this could change and may ultimately become a thorny issue in the bilateral relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;joint-military-exercises&quot;&gt;Joint Military Exercises&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike military aid and arms sales, which have waxed and waned over the years, joint exercises are a relatively new and thriving element of China-Russia military ties and a driver behind the strengthening of China-Russia relations in recent years. Joint military exercises provide China and the PLA with myriad benefits, such as operational experience and opportunities for deterrent signaling. These benefits could evolve or diminish, however, as China’s power grows and as Russia stagnates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-evolving-nature-of-china-russia-joint-exercises&quot;&gt;The Evolving Nature of China-Russia Joint Exercises&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia first participated in a military exercise together in 2003. The multilateral exercise, dubbed Coalition 2003, featured a series of counter-terrorism drills and brought together 1,300 troops from China, Russia, and three other members of the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Two years later, China and Russia held their first bilateral military exercise, known as Peace Mission 2005, which began in the Russian far eastern city of Vladivostok and moved to China’s Shandong Peninsula. The exercise was a major undertaking involving 8,000 Chinese troops and 2,000 Russian troops conducting both land and amphibious maneuvers. Exercises such as these, consisting of large ground or multi-domain operations, were the norm during the early years of China-Russia joint exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Faobkb2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China-Russia Joint Military Exercises by Type&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as China and Russia strengthened ties, they dramatically scaled up the number and type of exercises. In 2007, they conducted their first joint paramilitary exercise Cooperation 2007, focused on anti-terrorism drills, and in 2009 they held their first joint naval drills in the Gulf of Aden. Starting in 2014, China and Russia began to participate in large-scale competitions such as the Aviadarts air force competition and Tank Biathlon, both of which are now annual exercises. Since then, the two have further widened the aperture of their cooperation by participating in computer-based simulations and by conducting joint aerial patrols. Altogether, China and Russia participated in at least 78 joint military exercises between 2003 and mid-2022, with more than half of these taking place since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China-Russia joint exercises have also expanded in terms of geographic reach. Early exercises largely took place in the rugged terrains of western China and Central Asia, but more recent naval exercises saw the two operate in the distant waters of the South African coast, the Mediterranean Sea, and even as far as the Baltic Sea. Joint aerial patrols have likewise seen the two flying across broad swaths of the Western Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BK3AdTW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image7&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-china-benefits-from-joint-exercises-with-russia&quot;&gt;How China Benefits from Joint Exercises with Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China reaps many benefits from joint exercises with Russia. First and foremost, joint exercises have allowed the PLA to gain valuable experience operating with the far more experienced Russian military and afforded the PLA opportunities to practice maneuvering in a variety of geographies and climates far from China’s borders. These experiences are invaluable to the PLA, which has not engaged in large-scale military conflict in several decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint exercises provide additional benefits to China (and Russia) as a tool for sending political signals and deterring perceived adversaries. Chinese officials have long claimed that joint exercises do not target “third parties”; however, the 2020 edition of Science of Military Strategy — an authoritative textbook published by China’s National Defense University — states that an exercise “not only demonstrates the Chinese army’s combat capabilities to adversaries, but also causes doubts, making them uncertain about our intentions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, China and Russia have increasingly exploited joint exercises to signal to the United States and its allies. In September 2016, just two months after the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling that invalidated China’s claims over much of the South China Sea, China and Russia launched Joint Sea 2016, which featured island seizure operations in the South China Sea. It was their first and only naval exercise held there, sending a clear signal that it was a response to the tribunal’s ruling. More recently, in May 2022, China and Russia conducted a joint aerial patrol over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea that coincided with a summit of the leaders of the Quadrilateral Strategic Dialogue (also known as the Quad) in Tokyo. The move was widely seen as a direct response and intentional provocation in protest of the summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing also aims to use the exercises to positively signal to friends and neighbors. More than half of China-Russia exercises are multilateral. SCO members states and other neighbors participate in the lion’s share of these. These exercises help to both level up the military capabilities of these countries while also helping to assure them that China and Russia have the capability and will to aid them in addressing regional security threats. They also aim to ease worries in neighboring countries about Beijing’s own intentions, making the exercises an important element of China’s peripheral diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/55FsAVU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China-Russia Joint Military Exercise by Number of Participants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, joint military exercises help to strengthen the broader bilateral relationship by facilitating exchanges at multiple levels. The recent Zapad/Interaction 2021 exercises were viewed by Chinese experts as being unique in that the two sides not only jointly conducted the exercise but also collaborated in planning and commanding the exercises. More broadly, exercises have provided opportunities for Chinese military leaders — including vice chairs of China’s Central Military Commission and defense ministers — to meet with their Russian counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of this, exercises increase mutual trust and transparency by revealing to each other their respective capabilities. At Zapad/Interaction 2021, more than 80 percent of China’s equipment used in the exercise was new — including the PLA’s KJ-500 airborne early warning and control aircraft, J-20 and J-16 fighters, Y-20 transport planes, and surveillance and combat drones — giving Russia a look at some of China’s most advanced systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-shifting-dynamics-of-china-russia-joint-exercises&quot;&gt;The Shifting Dynamics of China-Russia Joint Exercises&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits that China gains from joint exercises with Russia are changing as China-Russia power dynamics shifts. Chinese analysts increasingly emphasize China’s military capabilities are catching up with, or surpassing, Russia’s. One expert argues, for example, that Chinese battalion groups have surpassed their Russian counterparts in terms of weapons and equipment and that Russian battalion tactical groups “are only suitable for the kind of battlefield in East Ukraine… and are easily defeated on high-intensity battlefields by advanced adversaries like the U.S. military.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has even started to flip the status quo by leading exercises while Russia participates from a junior position. Official Chinese media described the Zapad/Interaction 2021 exercises as the first in which the PLA led, as well as the first joint exercises held entirely in China using mostly Chinese weaponry. Li Shuyin, a researcher at the Academy of Military Sciences, emphasized the uniqueness of Zapad/Interaction 2021, describing it as “a change of roles” and a chance to create a joint exercise “brand” centered on the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This emerging dynamic is likely to be cemented as China’s power grows and Russia stagnates. Russia’s war in Ukraine may accelerate this trend. The Russian military has surprised many by how poorly it has performed in Ukraine, and the conflict has proven costly and deadly for Russia. If Russia becomes deeply weakened and overstretched by the war, it may be unable to carry out frequent large-scale exercises. This may lead China to pivot toward smaller-scale exercises that are focused less on operational benefits and more on political signaling. The two sides could also continue with frequent exercises but with China more consistently leading as the senior partner. Alternately, if Beijing concludes that Russia’s performance in Ukraine has been bad enough, it may ultimately rethink the value of participating in joint exercises with Russia and even reconsider the overall value of strategic ties with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

On February 4, 2022, just weeks before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, President Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin met and issued a historic joint statement which stated their bilateral relationship has “no limits” and that “there are no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation” between them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two countries have indeed significantly strengthened their relationship in recent years. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin enjoy close working relations, which drives high-level cooperation. The two sides also cooperate based on shared threat perceptions that the United States and its allies seek to encircle and undermine them. Close military ties and complementary economic dynamics help cement their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the China-Russia relationship is complex and comes with costs for both sides. Leaders in Beijing and Moscow appear to have assessed for now that the benefits outweigh the costs, but that calculus could change. In the sections that follow, this ChinaPower feature analyzes three key weaknesses of the relationship:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historical and structural factors engender strategic mistrust between Beijing and Moscow;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian stagnation renders Moscow a less useful partner and contributes to a growing power asymmetry; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian military aggression sparks blowback for China and exacerbates Russia’s stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;historical-and-structural-factors-create-strategic-mistrust&quot;&gt;Historical and Structural Factors Create Strategic Mistrust&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the strengthening of relations between Beijing and Moscow in recent years, considerable strategic mistrust exists between the two countries. Chinese strategic mistrust stems partly from the checkered history between the two countries, which saw the more powerful Russian Empire and the Soviet Union take advantage of a weaker China. For Russia’s part, enduring structural factors — especially geography — stoke fears that an increasingly powerful China may encroach on its interests and take advantage of Russian weaknesses. Moscow’s concerns are heightened by a strategic culture that harbors deep-seated great power ambitions and chafes at being the junior partner in a relationship with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present close relationship between China and Russia is a notable deviation from history, which often witnessed the more powerful neighbor taking advantage of the weaker country. In the 19th century, the Russian Empire was party to many of the “unequal treaties” that compelled China to hand over territory, money, and other spoils to European powers. The 1858 Treaty of Aigun and 1860 Treaty of Peking were particularly harsh, forcing China to forfeit approximately 1 million square kilometers (km) of territory to the Russian Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2Vvikud.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Key Historical Sources of Chinese Mistrust of Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mid-20th century, tensions between the newly founded People’s Republic of China and the Soviet Union devolved into the Sino-Soviet Split, which lasted into the 1980s. The two countries’ longstanding border disputes were a central flashpoint of the period. In 1969, hostility along the border escalated to nuclear posturing and nearly resulted in large-scale conflict between the two communist powers. Moscow also pressed Beijing on other fronts, including criticizing Chinese repression in Tibet and indirectly calling for Tibet’s independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations in 1989, China and Russia officially resolved their longstanding border disputes and Moscow began expressing support or neutrality on sensitive Chinese issues like Taiwan, Tibet, and Xinjiang. Nevertheless, Moscow’s decades of antagonism have remained a source of suspicion within China. The unequal treaties that Russia was partner to were central to China’s “century of humiliation,” which the Chinese Communist Party still draws on as a source of nationalistic energy. It is impossible to de-link Russia from that legacy. Many Chinese thinkers still view these historic incidents as indicators of Russia’s willingness to use its power to pursue its own interests at China’s expense, and many in China continue to be wary of Russia’s reliability as a strategic partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of historical factors, enduring structural factors generate friction in the relationship — chief among them, geography. China’s immediate proximity to Russia leads to competitive dynamics in areas along their shared periphery, most notably in the Russian Far East, Central Asia, and the Arctic. More fundamentally, China’s immense size and power make it a daunting neighbor in the event that relations between Beijing and Moscow sour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the opening of the China-Russia border in 1988, China’s presence in the Russian Far East emerged as an irritant in the relationship. As China’s economy grew, Chinese workers and businesses flowed into the region. Many went into the agricultural sector. One study found that in 2018 Chinese citizens owned or leased approximately 350,000 hectares (3,500 square km) of farming land in the Russian Far East — approximately 16 percent of the total land used for agriculture. The presence of Chinese workers in the region stirred up anger among some Russians, with many complaining about Chinese workers stealing Russian jobs and exploiting Russian natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns about China’s presence in the Russian Far East have waned somewhat in recent years, and China is broadly popular among the Russian public. According to the Pew Research Center, 71 percent of Russians said they viewed China positively in 2019 — the highest of all 35 countries surveyed. However, China’s presence in the Russia Far East continues to provoke negative views. A 2017 poll by the Russian Academy of Sciences found that more than one in three Russians view China’s increasing presence as “expansion.” Half of respondents said that China threatened Russia’s territorial integrity, and one-third of them believed that China’s policies endanger their country’s economic development. This negative local sentiment has at times stalled planned Chinese investment projects, such as a Chinese-funded water bottling plant in the Irkutsk region, which was suspended after local protests in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia also face competitive dynamics in their shared backyard of Central Asia, which could become a source of tensions. Moscow remains influential in the five former Soviet states of Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) and it considers the region to be within its “privileged sphere of influence.” Russia has thus far been willing to accept China’s activities there, for example, by cooperating with Beijing in the Chinese-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization and by not opposing China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) ambitions. Russia currently even reaps some benefits out of China’s presence in the region: China’s considerable economic engagement there helps to facilitate regional stability and development allowing Russia to focus more on shaping military and security dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China is stepping up its security and economic footprint in Central Asia in ways that may increasingly be perceived through a competitive lens by Moscow. In 2021, it was announced that China would construct an outpost for police special forces in Tajikistan. While it appears that Chinese forces will not be stationed there, China’s move was seen by some as an encroachment on Russia’s ties to Tajikistan, which is a member of the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (a rough analogue to NATO comprising former Soviet states) and home to Russia’s largest overseas military base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the economic front, China has rapidly replaced Russia as the larger trading partner of all five Central Asian states. In 2000, Chinese imports from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan totaled less than one-fourth of Russian imports, but by 2020 they were more than double Russia’s imports. China’s exports have ballooned as well, with $19.3 billion worth of Chinese goods destined for Central Asia in 2020. As this trend continues, it threatens to undercut Russia’s ability to wield its economic influence in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ China Has Surpassed Russia as the Bigger Trade Partner in All Former Soviet States in Central Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Russia is wary of Chinese ambitions in the Arctic, where Moscow has significant interests. Approximately one-fifth of Russia’s expansive territory is located within the Arctic Circle. This area encompasses more than 24,000 km of shoreline and is home to some 2.5 million people. Under Vladimir Putin, Russia has made the Arctic a key region of focus, including reviving Russia’s military presence there. In recent years, Russia has refurbished 50 previously closed Soviet-era military posts, including 13 air bases, 10 radar stations, 20 border outposts, and 10 integrated emergency rescue stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite lacking territory in the arctic, China has pushed to establish itself as a “near-Arctic state,” and in a 2018 white paper on the arctic, China put forward a vision for building a “Polar Silk Road” to complement the broader BRI. China and Russia have so far cooperated on energy and infrastructure projects in the region, but there have been considerable setbacks. Russia initially opposed allowing China onto the multilateral Arctic Council as an observer, and Moscow continues to be suspicious of Beijing’s strategic goals in the region. In 2012, Russia blocked Chinese research vessels from conducting surveys along the Northern Sea Route, and in 2020 Russian prosecutors charged a prominent Russian Arctic expert with treason for passing classified information to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, Russia may feel the need to push back against China’s growing influence in these areas. In the spirit of the Chinese idiom “一山不容二虎” (one mountain cannot tolerate two tigers), China may also assert its interests over Russia’s as it pushes to shore up its regional and global power. So far, China and Russia have managed to compartmentalize competition in these areas, and they have succeeded in strengthening relations despite their turbulent history. Yet the seeds of mistrust remain planted within the relationship and could someday grow into a major impediment in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-stagnation-exacerbates-tensions&quot;&gt;Russian Stagnation Exacerbates Tensions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia have long sought to cast themselves as equal partners, but this narrative is increasingly difficult to maintain given the growing power asymmetry between the two. As Russia stagnates or even declines, and as China continues to bolster its national power, Russia is poised to be a less useful partner to China in countering Western influence. China’s growing lead over Russia could also exacerbate existing tensions and mistrust between Beijing and Moscow if Russia feels it is being disrespected or treated as a junior partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across virtually all elements of national power — including economic, technological, and military power — China is surging ahead of Russia or rapidly catching up. Economically, China has already far surpassed Russia. On a nominal basis, the Chinese economy was nearly 10 times larger than Russia’s in 2021. For the first time, China even surpassed Russia in nominal per capita GDP in 2020 (though Russia remains ahead of China when adjusted for purchasing power parity). The gap is set to widen significantly in the coming years. Economic forecasts by the International Monetary Fund expect China’s GDP to climb toward nearly $30 trillion by 2027 while Russia’s GDP is forecasted to stall at well under $2 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ GDP of China and Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s stagnating economic growth is rendering it less important as an economic partner. In 2020, Russia only accounted for about 2 percent of China’s total trade (imports and exports). By comparison, China was Russia’s largest trade partner, accounting for about 18 percent of Russia’s trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term trends will likely render Russia even less economically relevant for China. Russia’s current value to China is in supplying energy, with oil, gas, and coal collectively accounting for two-thirds of Russia’s exports to China. Barring a major paradigm shift, Russia will decline in importance in the coming decades as China weens itself off fossil fuels. This trend is already in the works. In 2010, oil and coal made up nearly 87 percent of China’s energy consumption. In 2020, that figure had dropped to less than 76 percent. Similarly, renewable energies made up approximately 16 percent of China’s energy consumption — up from about 9 percent in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ The China-Russia Trade Imbalance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia would face enormous headwinds in transitioning toward a more balanced and competitive economy since Russia lags far behind China and other global leaders when it comes to technological power and sophistication. In 2020, China spent 14 times more on research and development (R&amp;amp;D) than Russia. This was not simply the result of differences in economic size: China also spent more than twice as much as Russia as a percent of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the board, Russia lacks the science and technology ecosystem needed to produce the kinds of products that would make it a more valuable and dynamic economic and technological partner for China in the long-term. The Global Innovation Index, a leading index measuring innovative capabilities and performance, ranked China 12th globally in 2021, just behind France and ahead of Japan. Meanwhile, it ranked Russia 45th alongside Vietnam (44th) and India (46th).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/x7QSOel.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Performance in Key Metrics of Science and Technology Innovation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian stagnation on the economic and technological fronts is weighing on its military power, which has traditionally been a key source of its strength and influence. In 2021, Russia spent virtually the same on its military as it did in 2014 (about $64 billion). China’s military budget grew over 47 percent during that period, from $183 billion to $270 billion.2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has multiple implications for China. In recent decades, Beijing has looked to Russia as a major military partner in competing with the United States and its allies, but Russia’s faltering defense spending is weighing on China and Russia’s collective capacity to compete militarily. In 2021, the United States and its NATO and Indo-Pacific allies collectively spent 3.7 times more on defense than China and Russia. More concretely, Chinese experts have complained about the state of the Russian military, highlighting, for example, that the Russian naval fleet largely comprises outdated Soviet-era vessels and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Mb7Un3c.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Defense Spending: China and Russia vs. the United States and Allies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether, or at what point, the power disparity between the two countries would threaten their relationship. If Russian power wanes and Western isolation of Russia continues, Moscow may conclude that it has no choice but to bandwagon with China. However, given Russian perceptions of itself and its history as a great power, Russia may be unwilling to have a close partnership with China that is not built on equality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are signs that some Russians are already wary of being treated poorly by China. In March 2022, former Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev described China’s leaders as “ruthless businessmen” and said “China will never take [Putin] as an equal partner or even as ally.” If Russian leaders feel that they are being taken advantage of or treated like the junior partner, they may ultimately choose to cool relations with Beijing and limit cooperation. Russia may even assess at some point that the power imbalance has become so severe that China poses a direct challenge or threat to Russia, which could result in a full pivot away from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-aggression-runs-counter-to-chinese-interests&quot;&gt;Russian Aggression Runs Counter to Chinese Interests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compounding these issues is Russia’s persistent military aggression on the world stage. Russia’s numerous military interventions — especially its ongoing war in Ukraine — have created political and economic blowback for China. On top of that, Russia’s war in Ukraine has weakened Russia, diminishing its utility to China and further exacerbating the widening power gap between China and Russia..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese strategists and analysts have contrasted Russia’s willingness to use force with China’s forbearance. Some have described Vladimir Putin as a “revolutionary” seeking to overturn the existing international order and noted that Moscow’s goals render it more willing to use violence to advance its interests. By comparison, Chinese scholars have characterized China as having the more modest goal of rendering the existing international system more conducive to China’s growth and development — and therefore less willing to resort to force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s willingness to use aggression has put China in politically awkward situations. Chinese officials have long described territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries as a cornerstone of China’s foreign policy. Chinese officials and propaganda outlets frequently try to cast China as having never invaded or bullied other countries. Russia’s repeated invasions of other countries run in direct opposition to those principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6jewgfW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Major Military Interventions by Russia under Vladimir Putin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has at times gone so far as to subtly criticize Russian military aggression. In 2008, then-spokesman of China’s foreign ministry Qin Gang stated that China “expressed concern” over the situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia during Russia’s war in Georgia. Mostly, China has sought to neither criticize nor directly side with Russia. Beijing, for example, has not recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia; nor has it recognized the breakaway Ukrainian territories of Donetsk and Luhansk or Russian claims over Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Xi Jinping has gone farther by publicly legitimizing Russian security and sovereignty concern, but this has come at a political and diplomatic cost. In the United Nations, China was compelled to make unpopular votes that placed it among a small minority of countries. In March 2022, for example, 141 countries voted in the UN General Assembly in favor of a resolution condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while China joined a minority of 34 other countries in abstaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rVnGSFO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ UN General Assembly Vote on Resolution to Condemn Russia’s 2022 Invasion of Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war in Ukraine has also propelled a rapid and significant improvement in relations between the United States and its European allies as they collectively counter Russia, and it has strengthened perceived fault lines between democracies and autocracies — unwelcome outcomes for China. In the United States, China’s tacit support for Russia has brought a spotlight to the China-Russia relationship, with 62 percent of people polled describing it as posing “a very serious problem.” In Europe, a key economic partner for China where Beijing has been pushing to gain influence, countries there have toughened their stance toward China. In April and May, China sent an envoy to meet with officials in eight central and eastern European countries with the hopes of improving ties, but China’s outreach was rebuffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has also inflicted economic pain on China. The global rise in energy prices sparked by the war led oil prices to spike in China — much as they did in other countries. According to Chinese customs data, the price of China’s crude oil imports rose to RMB 5,070 per metric ton in April 2022 — up 37 percent from January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/a88s3G5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Average Monthly Price of Chinese Crude Oil Imports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and its companies are also facing the added burden of navigating Western sanctions on Russia. While China has not joined U.S. and European sanctions on Russia, and despite Beijing’s calls for companies to continue conducting business in Russia, many Chinese firms have paused or cut operations there. This includes major Chinese tech companies like computer-maker Lenovo, smartphone-maker Xiaomi, and drone-maker DJI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, China’s exports to Russia plummeted to RMB 24.1 billion in April 2022 — down 53 percent from the recent high of RMB 52 billion in December 2021. Technology exports have been particularly hard hit. In March, laptop sales to Russia were down more than 40 percent and smartphones down by nearly two-thirds. In late May, five Chinese firms were told to stop construction of a Chinese-Russian liquefied natural gas pipeline, a key node in China’s “Polar Silk Road,” to avoid EU sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fgpF3mp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Chinese Monthly Exports to Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to causing political and economic blowback, Russia’s wars threaten to further diminish Russia’s utility as a strategic partner for China. Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine created significant setbacks for the Russian military and its supporting defense industry. The war disrupted Russia’s ability to deliver weapons systems to Vietnam — one of Russia’s top arm export markets — which in turn contributed to a broader decline in Russia’s arms exports in recent years. During the 2016-2021 period, Russian arms sales around the world declined 24 percent over the previous six-year period, and its share of global arms sales fell from 25 percent to 19 percent. This undercut a notable benefit of the China-Russia relationship for Beijing, wherein Russia could wield its prominence as an arms exporter to influence countries — like Vietnam — with which China has tense relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine has had far more drastic consequences for Russia. Western sanctions have had substantial impacts on the Russian economy. Russia’s GDP is expected to shrink by 8.5 percent in 2022 and unemployment is expected to rise substantially. Russia’s military losses in Ukraine are also staggering. In June 2022, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley stated that the Russian military had already lost roughly 20 to 30 percent of its armored force in Ukraine, which he described as a “huge” and “significant” loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, Beijing has chosen to double down on its relationship with Russia despite these drawbacks. These developments nevertheless represent meaningful headaches for China. Russia is stagnating, and perhaps in outright decline, which could ultimately exacerbate existing mistrust between Beijing and Moscow and potentially render Russia of far less strategic value to China.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>CSIS China Power Team</name></author><summary type="html">Russia’s war in Ukraine has cast a spotlight on the China-Russia relationship.

Yet this moment could be short-lived if not followed by a sustained, collective effort to transform and rationalize European defense.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Without this, additional European defense spending may be wasted and the continent will continue to rely on the United States for its defense. European nations should fully leverage the European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and other multilateral formats to overcome fragmentation and avoid a piecemeal approach to defense. By doing so, they can invest together in modern capabilities, build a strong, resilient, and open industrial base, and think creatively to pool and share forces. Importantly, the United States has a crucial role in providing both practical and political support to achieve this shared goal of a stronger and more capable European defense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s brutal war of aggression in Ukraine has mobilized European nations to think more seriously about security and defense. In addition to sending an impressive surge of military equipment to Ukraine and making commitments at the Madrid summit to reinforce the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) eastern flank with troops and materiel, the European Union also took new steps in its evolution as a credible defense actor. Perhaps most critically, European nations have also announced substantial increases to their defense budgets. A burst of political will — ignited by the invasion and fanned by its brutality — has fueled this response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developments are significant, but it would be premature to assume they mark the beginning of a new era. A true paradigm shift will require a sustained and focused effort to lock in the commitments that have already been made, ensure efficient implementation of those commitments, and build the institutional structure necessary to keep European defense moving in the desired direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-transformational-moment&quot;&gt;A Transformational Moment?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Cold War, European nations largely permitted their militaries to atrophy. The focus of military activity shifted from hypothetical conflict against a peer adversary to expeditionary operations focused on crisis management, counterinsurgency, and counterterrorism. With the exception of the Balkans, these operations were also primarily out of area; the possibility of major war on the European continent appeared low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This began to change after the original Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Russia’s act of aggression catalyzed NATO’s European allies to commit at the Wales summit to meet the alliance’s target of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense. After decades of low-end operations, some European countries began the painful process of reconstituting their militaries for high-intensity warfare. On land, this has included a focus on rebuilding the readiness and aptitude of heavy, combat-capable brigades. At sea, it has included investments in principal surface combatants, submarines, amphibious vessels, and long-range strike, among other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After February 24, 2022, the argument for robust investment in the capabilities required for modern collective defense went from sensible to irrefutable. A Russian attack on a NATO member is no longer unthinkable. Indeed, NATO’s new strategic concept says as much: “We cannot discount the possibility of an attack against Allies’ sovereignty and territorial integrity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As European security has become more perilous, U.S. attention has increasingly been pulled toward Asia. Despite Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. Department of Defense has continued to prioritize China, which the unclassified summary of the forthcoming National Defense Strategy calls “our most consequential strategic competitor and the pacing challenge.” In other words, the U.S. pivot to the Indo-Pacific may have been paused or lessened in degree by events in Europe, but it has not been canceled. The need for the United States to provide precious military assets to defend Europe against Russia, support U.S. allies in Asia, and maintain other global commitments, such as in the Middle East, may put tremendous strain on the United States. Washington will therefore need more from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe seems on its way to stepping up to this challenge. There has been strong political will in Europe to take bolder steps, which has manifested in robust EU sanctions on Russia and support for Ukraine, including lethal and non-lethal aid and working to take in refugees — an area the European Union has found difficult in the past. The European Union’s recently released A Strategic Compass for Security and Defense signals a higher level of ambition for the bloc on foreign and security policy. In NATO, Europeans will contribute to troop reinforcements on the eastern flank, and two new European nations with highly capable militaries, Finland and Sweden, will join the strategic alliance. Most pertinently, the majority of European countries — from economic powerhouse Germany to tiny Luxembourg and neutral Ireland — have announced they will increase their defense budgets, opening the door to a potential future where Europe can theoretically afford to field the majority of the military capabilities necessary for its own self-defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The need for the United States to provide precious military assets to defend Europe against Russia, support U.S. allies in Asia, and maintain other global commitments, such as in the Middle East, may put tremendous strain on the United States. Washington will therefore need more from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sustaining-momentum&quot;&gt;Sustaining Momentum&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the opportunity for bold action on European defense will not remain forever. Europe has many other policy priorities: post-Covid economic recovery, migration, climate change and the energy transition, and tackling inflation, to name a few. Furthermore, although NATO has seen promising further rises in defense spending since 2014, many of the announcements made since February 24 have yet to be realized. In the short run, turning those announcements into budgetary commitments is how Europe can retain forward momentum. In the long run, while these new developments are encouraging, Europeans will still face many challenges to sustain that momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decades of declining defense budgets have led to a dramatic downsizing of European armed forces and generated major capability gaps. Competing national defense industries and diverging operational needs have also resulted in a deeply fragmented defense landscape where cooperative solutions are an exception, not the rule. Finally, endless debates on the need for, or the danger of, more European strategic autonomy have slowed down European ambitions and are still vivid today in the context of the war in Ukraine. Having a clear understanding of these limitations is critical as Europeans think about the future of their defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;decades-of-underinvestment&quot;&gt;Decades of Underinvestment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent decisions in Europe to boost defense budgets represent good news but come after decades of budgetary cuts and anemic defense investment that has resulted in a major and lasting depreciation of European armed forces, especially compared to the Cold War period. Even though European partners started to increase their defense budgets again in 2015 (see Graph 1), primarily in reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, they had dug themselves an incredibly deep hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/l6rnoAz.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
▲ &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graph 1: NATO Europe and Canada - defence expenditure.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_197050.htm&quot;&gt;Defence Expenditures of NATO Countries (2014-2022)&lt;/a&gt;,” NATO, June 27, 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last two decades, European militaries have lost 35 percent of their capabilities. To take the example of European navies, European countries had almost 200 large surface combatants and 129 submarines in 1990, but only 116 and 66, respectively, in 2021. Europe’s combat power at sea is considered to be about half of what it was during the height of the Cold War. Although often justified as favoring high-tech quality over quantity, reduced operational “mass” remains concerning. For example, the war in Ukraine suggests platforms remain vulnerable in high-intensity warfare. Russia itself might attest to this: according to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Russian military may have lost 1,500 tanks, 3,600 armored vehicles, 750 artillery pieces, and 210 aircraft between the beginning of the invasion and the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Declining military investments have also led to major capability gaps. As witnessed with military engagements in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and the Sahel, European armed forces are still relying on U.S. support for critical enablers such as air-to-air refueling, strategic airlift, and reconnaissance and intelligence capacities. The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan was a sobering demonstration of these limitations, as European states were incapable of evacuating their own citizens and allies without logistical support from Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine offers another example of such constraints: European states have struggled to supply Ukraine with needed heavy weaponry. So far, the United States has provided most of the military assistance to Ukraine, demonstrated most recently by the adoption of a massive $40 billion support package. While Europeans have stepped up militarily, restricted stocks of equipment and ammunition are limiting their support, especially as they also have to maintain national militaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-fragmented-defense-landscape&quot;&gt;A Fragmented Defense Landscape&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not simply that European countries are spending too little on defense, but also that they are doing so in a piecemeal way. In fact, overall European military spending is not that low. In 2020, for example, Europe collectively spent $378 billion on defense (roughly half of total U.S. defense spending). Yet, different strategic cultures and competing defense industries have led European governments to prioritize national solutions at the expense of collective projects. As recently underlined by the European Defense Agency, EU countries conducted only 11 percent of their total equipment procurement in a European framework in 2020. This share is well below the 25 percent share reached in 2011 and far short of the commitment member states made in 2017 to reach 35 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of joint procurement has resulted in a fragmented defense landscape. European armed forces suffer major redundancies, with 29 different types of destroyers, 17 types of main battle tanks, and 20 types of fighter planes, as compared to four, one, and six, respectively, for the United States. Some European countries have managed to develop joint platforms in the past, such as the A400M military transport aircraft, the Eurofighter combat aircraft, and the Tiger attack helicopter. But even these collaborative programs have not necessarily led to a rationalization of European capabilities. For instance, because of diverging operational requirements, the Tiger helicopter has been developed in four different models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has revealed another limitation of the European defense industrial base: the attrition of its military industrial capacity. Decades of declining defense budgets have led European countries to sacrifice scale for efficiency. As a result, they have struggled to respond to Ukraine’s needs due to limited stockpiles and slow production capacities. European defense industries are also facing vulnerable supply chains, showcased by the Covid-19 pandemic, with a growing dependence on critical raw materials from international sources, including China, for certain sectors, as NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg cautioned at the Madrid summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This lack of joint procurement has resulted in a fragmented defense landscape.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;no-clear-political-consensus&quot;&gt;No Clear Political Consensus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are major political obstacles to rationalizing European defense. What should amount to a largely practical and pragmatic effort often descends into an ideological squabble over “strategic autonomy” or national sovereignty. Bureaucratic turf wars erupt between ministries of defense, NATO, and the European Union over roles and responsibilities. National defense industries also each have their privileged place within national capitals and push for their interests, which are often at odds with creating a more integrated European defense landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can also play an obstructive role. Many European countries are reliant on U.S. security guarantees, giving the United States tremendous influence over the direction of European security. The United States is often a vocal opponent of European defense industrial initiatives focused on integration, as they benefit European companies to the detriment of the U.S. defense industry. Moreover, the United States has opposed EU defense efforts, fearing that NATO, and therefore the United States, would lose its pride of place in the European security architecture. This has led to a recitation by many in the United States that there should be “no duplication” of NATO by the European Union. Yet concerns over “duplication” can be treated so broadly as to risk erasing any role for the European Union in defense when it in fact can play a crucial role in fostering integration, mobilizing resources, and coordinating investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also clear strategic differences within Europe. European ambitions on security and defense have often been hampered by political debates surrounding notions of European “strategic autonomy” or “sovereignty.” These often passionate discussions reveal that European states disagree on the urgency for Europe to become capable of defending itself alone. There is a looming prospect of a future U.S. administration returning to an “America First” policy that relegates European security and multilateral institutions such as NATO. Paradoxically, the leadership position assumed by the United States since the beginning of the war in Ukraine has weakened the movement toward more European autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These disputes have resulted in a Europe which still relies too much on Washington to ensure its security and defense. In a recent study called the European Sovereignty Index, the European Council on Foreign Relations underlines that “the state of European security and defense sovereignty leaves much to be desired, especially in countries seeing U.S. security guarantees as their “main form of life insurance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-blueprint-for-the-next-decade&quot;&gt;A Blueprint for the Next Decade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges to transforming European defense can be overcome. The level of ambition laid out in recent strategic documents, such as the European Union’s “Strategic Compass” and NATO’s new strategic concept, provides the requisite conceptual foundation. Practically speaking, this begins with following through on the defense spending pledges already made, but long-term success will require an ambitious vision to rationalize European defense, streamline its many national and intergovernmental processes, eliminate redundancies, and maximize efficiency. If Europe fails to do so, it will not get full value for its investments. Charting a few key lines of effort is a useful place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;toward-joint-planning-in-europe&quot;&gt;Toward Joint Planning in Europe&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two levels of defense planning in Europe: national and multinational. At the national level, countries regularly produce defense strategies, which set out their national priorities for defense investment. At the multinational level, the two main efforts are NATO’s defense planning process (NDPP) and the European Union’s capability development process, which involves several institutions but is led by the European Defence Agency (EDA). Both identify military capability gaps and develop procurement plans to fill them. While there is some degree of synchronization between them — “ensuring the coherence and complementarity of each other’s defence planning processes” has been a goal of EU-NATO cooperation since at least 2016 — it has not been sufficient to prevent the fragmentation and duplication discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new approach that better aligns these processes and emphasizes joint development of capabilities is needed, especially for those most relevant for collective defense. The EDA is currently reviewing its Capability Development Plan, which was last updated in 2018. Promisingly, it will reportedly emphasize high-intensity warfighting scenarios and include guidance on working with NATO. This is notable, as the next NDPP cycle will likely begin next year now that the political guidance from the new strategic concept has been set. This moment of simultaneous review represents an opportunity. Although existing EU-NATO formats already endeavor to “ensure the coherence of output” between the two processes by exchanging information, coordination could be more proactive, perhaps even creating mechanisms for jointly identifying potential projects, in conversation with national ministries and defense industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthening-europes-defense-industrial-base&quot;&gt;Strengthening Europe’s Defense Industrial Base&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sustain an ambitious investment strategy, Europe needs to take a more strategic approach to its defense industrial base. The challenges in sustaining military assistance to Ukraine have shown why European force planning should drive the development of its industrial base, for example, to ensure sufficient stockpiles of weapons and spare parts. This should also include ramping up limited defense manufacturing capacities. In the short term, Europeans could mobilize their civilian industry to help support the defense sector; France aims to do so by emulating the U.S. Defense Priorities and Allocations System Program. In the medium term, the European Union should invest in advanced manufacturing, from robotics to nanotechnologies to advanced materials technologies. In the longer term, they should also encourage industrial alliances or even integration to rationalize production capacity, as France and the United Kingdom have pursued in the missile sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European states also need to strengthen supply chain resilience. First, they should seek to diversify their supply of raw materials and components by collectively identifying alternative suppliers or substitutions. Second, the European Union should invest in domestic production of critical components, starting with semiconductors. In February 2022, the European Commission announced the European Chips Act, which aims to substantially increase chip production. Finally, the European Union should consider joint purchasing for the most critical raw materials to help create collective strategic reserves, which it already does for gas. Facing similar challenges, the United States and European Union should deepen their coordination on supply chain resilience using recent transatlantic working groups such as the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council and the U.S.-EU dialogue on security and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The challenges in sustaining military assistance to Ukraine have shown why European force planning should drive the development of its industrial base, for example, to ensure sufficient stockpiles of weapons and spare parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transatlantic coordination is also required to build the strong and sustainable defense and technology industrial base needed to underpin the long-term strategic advantage of NATO and the European Union. There are several fissures in transatlantic defense industrial policy that have the potential to, as one recent CEPS study puts it, “sorely undermine transatlantic unity.” These include Europe’s tendency to excessively buy non-European equipment, the controversial issue of non-EU third-party participation in joint EU capability initiatives, and export, technology, and intellectual property controls on both sides of the Atlantic that risk creating competing, rather than complementary, industrial bases. These potential pitfalls need to be addressed if the Euro-Atlantic community is to maintain the open, thriving ecosystem of technology and innovation it needs to stay competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;catalyzing-joint-development-and-procurement&quot;&gt;Catalyzing Joint Development and Procurement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many European countries have decided to raise defense spending in response to Russia’s war against Ukraine, there are concerns that this will not translate into coordinated and coherent investments. This is where the European Union has an instrumental role to play in encouraging its members to jointly develop and procure defense capabilities. Fortunately, EU countries have already created promising tools to foster such a collaborative approach, such as the Permanent Structured Cooperation and the European Defense Fund, which has been allocated €8 billion ($8.3 billion) for 2021 to 2027. The European Commission has also recently announced an even more innovative program of €500 million ($507 million) to incentivize EU members to pursue joint procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU countries should not only fully leverage these tools but also expand their financial scope given the huge needs going forward. The €8 billion defense fund and the €500 million joint procurement program are a good start but are clearly insufficient to answer the immense investment needs. Furthermore, the joint procurement program still needs to get off the ground. Following the model of the €750 billion ($760.5 billion) Next Generation EU recovery plan, the European Commission could borrow on capital markets to either support collaborative investments or pursue joint procurements on behalf of member states. NATO’s common funding and new innovation fund could also contribute these much-needed investments. Increasing NATO’s common funding was discussed in the leadup to the Madrid summit but had limited follow-through in the strategic concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These coordinated investments should focus on high-end capabilities, building on existing projects such as a 15-nation effort to develop a new ground-based air defense system by 2028, the French-German-Spanish next-generation fighter program, and the Italian-led project to develop a new armored fighting vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;thinking-creatively-to-pool-and-share-forces&quot;&gt;Thinking Creatively to Pool and Share Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another potential avenue for rationalizing European defense is via initiatives that pool and share national forces under a multinational command. A few examples can already be found in Europe. One of the oldest is the Benelux naval integration, under which the Belgian and Dutch navies operate under the commander of the Royal Netherlands Navy, who receives the title of Admiral Benelux. Another example is the European Air Transport Command (EATC), a program under which seven Western European countries pool military air mobility assets for air transport and air-to-air refueling under a single joint command. The new Franco-German tactical air transport squadron will fly missions for the EATC. Countries benefit from these arrangements in situations where their individual capacities are insufficient to meet some threshold for reliable operational success. These initiatives also increase interoperability through joint training and exercising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such efforts may seem niche and technical, but in fact represent a symbolic concession in a core area of national sovereignty. In these cases, as when they commit troops to NATO operations, nations decide if the security benefits outweigh any political costs. It should be noted that this concept is not new: the European Union has championed “pooling and sharing” since 2012, while NATO has focused on “Smart Defence” to achieve “greater security, for less money, by working together with more flexibility.” Both initiatives have had mixed results. Nonetheless, European countries should make a concerted effort, perhaps led by defense planners at the NATO or EU level, to explore new initiatives along these lines. Any new arrangements could constitute a new tool in NATO’s tool kit. In order to make this happen, European governments may have to make the strategic case to their own citizens that a trade-off in terms of sovereignty is worth the associated cost savings and the likely increase of overall European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-push-from-washington&quot;&gt;A Push from Washington?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If European defense is to be rationalized along some of these lines, the United States will need to play a critical role. For years, the United States has led a cadre of European nations that are critical or at least skeptical of EU ambitions to increase its capacity as a defense actor. The main fear has been the “Three Ds” of “decoupling, duplication, and discrimination.” Essentially, the United States and others are worried that unfettered EU defense and security initiatives could siphon resources and attention away from NATO. This fear of decoupling and duplication still manifests in many major documents, such as the most recent progress report on EU-NATO cooperation or the new NATO strategic concept. The fear of discrimination is present in debates about divergence in the transatlantic industrial base and the alleged exclusion of third parties from joint capability and procurement initiatives. It is time to rethink some of these assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most would agree that it is in the U.S. interest for Europe to be able to defend itself to the greatest degree possible without a large U.S. military commitment. As the late Madeline Albright wrote: “Our interest is clear: we want a Europe that can act. We want a Europe with modern, flexible military forces that are capable of putting out fires in Europe’s backyard and working with us through the alliance to defend our common interests. European efforts to do more for Europe’s own defence make it easier, not harder, for us to remain engaged.” America’s recipe for getting this done was to focus on “enhancing the practical capabilities Europe brings to our alliance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this focus on the practical over the political led to a paradox in European defense: progress on practical capabilities could only go so far in the absence of political support for their development and use. The capability gaps, fragmentation, and inefficiencies in European defense are as much due to political imperatives — to avoid the “Three Ds” — as they are down to insufficient investment, modernization, and institutional initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore time for the Biden administration, and future administrations, to find a new recipe for transforming European defense to achieve Albright’s goal of “a Europe that can act.” Several questions can serve as a starting point. First, how can the United States help Europe generate the practical capabilities and political support it needs to defend itself? This could be done through several avenues including NATO, the European Union, and mini- and bilateral frameworks, but it must be coordinated and consistent. Second, how can a balance be struck between the risk of duplication versus the risk of fragmentation and capability gaps? Third, what is the role of the European Union in stepping up as an engine of joint procurement for the most vital and expensive systems and high-end capabilities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-stronger-more-capable-european-defense&quot;&gt;A Stronger, More Capable European Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent the last decade urging European states to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense. Now that European partners are spending more, the United States should become the most forceful advocate for transforming European defense. The United States’ role as the key guarantor of European security puts it in a privileged position. This is especially true for the most vulnerable NATO allies on the eastern flank, all of whom are also EU members and therefore in a position to block or water down EU initiatives. It follows that Washington’s support for EU defense proposals can play a major role in determining their fate. After years of urging European allies to spend more on defense, a new diplomatic initiative is needed that does not waste the urgency that Russia’s war in Ukraine created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington should encourage European countries to leverage the European Union, NATO, and other, flexible formats to rationalize the fragmented defense and industrial landscape by investing together in modern capabilities, building a strong and resilient industrial base, and thinking creatively to pool and share forces. To make this happen, the United States must provide practical and political support, including through encouraging the European Union’s ambitions and assuring eastern allies that those ambitions do not reduce U.S. commitment to their defense through NATO — which, it should be noted, the European Union’s own strategic compass still recognizes as the “foundation of collective defence for its [EU] members.” When combined with some of the initiatives proposed above, this active support from the United States could kickstart a new era of European defense and achieve the shared goal of “a stronger and more capable European defense, that contributes positively to transatlantic and global security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PNG presents unique operating challenges for the U.S. government’s implementation teams&lt;/strong&gt; due to the complex factors driving fragility in the country and limited U.S. government presence on the ground.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The key challenge facing policymakers is to generate clarity and consensus&lt;/strong&gt; on what factors of fragility the United States will address, how the United States will develop a bespoke operating model in PNG, and who will be critical to these efforts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landmark &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/policymakers-guide-global-fragility-act&quot;&gt;Global Fragility Act&lt;/a&gt; (GFA) was signed into U.S. law in 2019. In April 2022, the Biden administration identified Papua New Guinea (PNG) as a partner country in a prologue it added to the 2020 U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/global-fragility-strategy-gets-refresh&quot;&gt;Global Fragility Strategy&lt;/a&gt; (GFS). Under the strategy, the United States has committed to at least 10 years of programmatic efforts aimed at lowering violence levels and enhancing conflict-prevention efforts in PNG. U.S. officials have indicated they intend to benefit from “lessons learned from decades of U.S. involvement overseas, to enhance the way the U.S. Government engages in challenging environments and to jointly build resilience against political, economic, and natural shocks.” The distinguishing feature of the GFS is its express intention to expand U.S. focus on preventing fragility, violence, and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief provides policymakers with ideas on how to deploy U.S. conflict-prevention and peacebuilding capabilities in PNG. It outlines the strategic importance of PNG in the broader region, then canvasses four fragility trends to watch before discussing how to leverage U.S. strengths and avoid the pitfalls of those who have long operated in PNG. The brief concludes with recommendations on how to create a bespoke GFA operating model for addressing fragility focused on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cultivating a deliberate and adaptive planning process;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PNG is one of the most biodiverse countries on earth. It is as diverse geographically — consisting of mountains, jungles, and valleys — as it is ethnically and linguistically. PNG is rich in gold, copper, silver, natural gas, timber, oil, and fisheries, bringing distinct economic opportunities not always available to the other Pacific Island states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PNG has shown remarkable resilience despite much international analysis and discourse (including in this brief) focusing on the factors contributing to its fragility. For example, although the 1988–98 Bougainville civil war resulted in an estimated 20,000 deaths, PNG navigated a predominately peaceful independence referendum for the autonomous region of Bougainville in November 2019 (see textbox). Despite extremely high levels of corruption and violence, its civil society discusses, reports on, and circulates instances of corruption and violence with significant energy and freedom — particularly through social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While PNG does not have an extensive breadth or depth of civil society organizations (CSOs), those that exist provide avenues for engagement with the government and, if appropriately empowered, can generate better governance outcomes. Dialogues such as the 2021 forum on gender and human rights bring together government, civil society, and advocacy groups to assess the successes, failures, and opportunities for advancing human development in PNG. Civil society groups also fill in critical gaps in service delivery. Churches, for example, provide around 50 percent of healthcare services and independently operate two universities. Additionally, while PNG’s growing youth population brings significant employment and education challenges, it is also a great opportunity for a new generation to lead the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PNG is strategically relevant to the United States and its allies, Australia in particular. Its status as Australia’s closest neighbor and its history as a former colony and site of Allied cooperation against Japanese forces during World War II means that it holds a place in both the strategic and nostalgic imaginations of many Australians and Americans who served in the Pacific theater. Australia is the single largest donor working in PNG and has been regarded by many U.S. administrations as key to engagement in Melanesia and the Pacific Islands, especially given the relatively light U.S. footprint in the region. While it was resoundingly rejected by many Australians and regional leaders at the time, the mid-2000s image of Australian prime minister Howard as “Washington’s deputy sheriff” in the Pacific was a prevailing notion for years. Even now, there is a sense in some Australian foreign policy circles that signs of increased fragility in places like PNG do not reflect well on Australia’s role in the country or region. It is easy to imagine that Australia would welcome increased U.S. focus on PNG and opportunities to collaborate on, among other things, violent conflict prevention programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;PNG is strategically relevant to the United States and its allies, Australia in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PNG is also a destination for Australian and U.S. businesses and is increasingly a place where rival geostrategic interests meet. Chinese communities have long been present in PNG, but recent fear of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) expansionism in the region has put it on the radar of U.S. and Australian officials, especially after the recent Solomon Islands–CCP security pact sent shockwaves through Washington and Canberra alike. Meanwhile, the ongoing process of Bougainvillean independence and the possibility of similar movements from other provinces suggest significant potential for fragmentation within PNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;independence-and-autonomy-movements&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Independence and Autonomy Movements&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In November 2019, Bougainville held a referendum on whether residents wanted greater autonomy or full independence from PNG. Nearly 98 percent of voters chose independence, with at least 85 percent voter turnout. This historic event on the island, located nearly 600 miles east of Port Moresby, comes after decades of unrest and displacement. Tensions over control of the island’s natural resources escalated into what became known as the Bougainville civil war, which lasted from 1988–98 and was the most violent conflict in the South Pacific since World War II. As many as 20,000 people died, many were displaced, and social services in Bougainville were disrupted. The Bougainville Peace Agreement that marked the end of the war stipulated that an independence referendum would be held 10–15 years after the first Autonomous Bougainville Government was elected in June 2005. While it was successfully and peacefully executed, the referendum vote is nonbinding, and leadership from both sides will have to negotiate a final agreement, which could take years.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Similar movements exist in the New Ireland, Enga, and East New Britain provinces, which have called for greater autonomy for over a decade. Shared grievances over the national government’s mismanagement of natural resources and failure to deliver public services have increased the prevalence of regional and provincial fragmentation. While there is no imminent threat of violence, the political legitimacy of these sentiments could generate greater factionalization throughout the country. It could also give prominence to political elites who exploit them to mobilize voters and create opportunities for geostrategic competitors to exert greater influence in newly formed nations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospect of a PNG that is increasingly poor, susceptible to foreign interference, and fragile is a stark reality for Australia. Taken to its most extreme, fragility in PNG might precipitate external intervention—just as Australia intervened in the Solomon Islands Regional Assistance Mission for a decade following civil unrest — and could also shift the balance of power in Melanesia against U.S. and allied interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the proximity of the Pacific Island nations to vital trade routes and relevance to U.S. and allied security assets, PNG’s strategic profile is only growing. This is evident in the recent shift in rhetoric, funding commitments, high-level visits, and partnership-led tone of engagement by Australia’s new Albanese government, which is echoed by a significant uptick in the attention Washington has paid to the Pacific Islands since the end of World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four-fragility-trends-in-papua-new-guinea&quot;&gt;Four Fragility Trends in Papua New Guinea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PNG gained its independence from Australia in September 1975 after roughly seven decades of colonial rule. In the years leading up to independence, a Constitutional Planning Committee (CPC) was tasked with recommending priorities and mechanisms of implementation for an eventual PNG constitution. Following comprehensive, countrywide consultations, in August 1974 the CPC released its report, which recommended an endogenous state- and nation-building process, prioritizing human development over economic growth. The 350-page report specified rights and freedoms and established five national goals and directive principles to achieve a free and just society in PNG. However, the constitution that was adopted in August 1975 was a watered-down version of the unique, autochthonous features of governance the CPC proposed. Instead, the new government approved a “conventional Westminster-type constitution,” choosing to avoid contentious issues of citizenship and decentralization. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this did not translate into the nation-building process that many envisioned. This history contributes to the modern state of PNG not enjoying a high degree of legitimacy with its citizens — who, in turn, have only limited access to inclusive channels for engaging with the state. Democratic governance principles are not institutionalized, and legacies of colonialism linger, contributing to a general downward trend of instability and insecurity in PNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief focuses on four phenomena that are simultaneously the cause and result of shortcomings in PNG’s development and the current dynamics of fragility. These include: (1) weak governance, (2) economic inequality, (3) vulnerability to climate change and limited adaptive capacity, and (4) intercommunal and gender-based violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;weak-governance&quot;&gt;Weak Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weak governance in PNG is a barrier to meaningful participation in civic life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Over the past several decades, the tenets of personal and collective wellbeing envisioned by the CPC report — and engrained in the Melanesian concept of gutpela sindaun — have been replaced by a political-economic system that has proven corrupt and whereby citizens, especially women and youth, cannot fully engage in sociopolitical affairs. A 2019 survey across six provinces of PNG revealed few citizens felt that they had “a lot of influence” over government decisionmaking at the national and local levels. Disempowerment was especially acute among women, who felt that patriarchal views and systemic gender inequality preclude their representation in leadership positions and engagement with political representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of the Papua New Guinean state makes it difficult for citizens to interact with national, provincial, and local-level governments. The diverse physical and human geography of PNG makes the functions of a central government uniquely difficult. PNG consists of the main island and 600 offshore islands, with a population of about nine million people who speak more than 800 languages and make up about 600 distinct tribes. The 1995 Organic Law on Provincial Government and Local Level Government and its amendments instituted a model of decentralization whereby provincial and local-level governments were allocated budgets to fund and deliver public services. In principle, such a decentralized state facilitates citizen empowerment and development from the bottom up — especially considering the strong Melanesian traditions of consensus, reciprocity, and the harmonization of diversity. However, this technical and largely top-down process has failed to establish mechanisms for accountability and community participation, particularly ones that leverage the country’s latent dynamism. As a result, local governments have limited capacity, weak accountability mechanisms, funding gaps, and unqualified staff, making public administration primed for corruption and capturable by political elites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;PNG consists of the main island and 600 offshore islands, with a population of about nine million people who speak more than 800 languages and make up about 600 distinct tribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Women face additional barriers to participation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Women are historically underrepresented in Papua New Guinean politics and public administration. Since independence in 1975, only seven women have been elected to PNG’s National Parliament. Although 167 female candidates are running in the 2022 elections, as of publication in August 2022, two female representatives have been confirmed in office. Additionally, women hold only 24 percent of administrative positions in national public service; that portion further decreases to 7 percent at the executive-appointment level. At the provincial and subnational levels, women’s representation in public service is marginal, accounting for zero executive-level appointments, 6 percent of senior management, and only 10 percent of middle management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are both institutional and cultural barriers to women’s participation in government. There is no quota to ensure women are elected to the national legislature. Each one of several attempts to institutionalize women holding political office failed, most recently in March 2022, when a proposal to have 5 parliamentary seats out of 111 reserved for women was shelved until after the August general elections. PNG’s patriarchal society and gender norms, which colonial administrations reinforced, also limit women’s political participation and institutional seniority. Threats of divorce, public shame, harassment, and physical violence prevent women from exercising political agency. Elections are also highly localized and personalized; political candidates must bargain for support among those who control voting blocs through patronage networks. Since women are mostly excluded from leadership hierarchies in the first place, they often lack the resources and networks to negotiate support among local leaders. Political and public administration systems favor so-called “big men” who cultivate patronage networks, reinforcing citizens’ association of political authority with men and view of leadership as a masculine trait. The disparity in women’s engagement in sociopolitical systems and processes reinforces the conditions under which gender equality and gender-based violence (discussed in more detail below) persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weak governance and limited capacity hinder the state’s provision of security and broader services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Governance limitations have increasingly manifested in the inability of the state to provide safety in the face of growing intercommunal violence nationwide. In Hela Province in the highlands, for example, a land dispute in January 2021 between two relatives led to the deaths of 21 people. At the time, there were only about 60 permanent police officers in the province, which has a population of approximately 250,000 people. The July 2022 death tolls from election-related assaults suggest intercommunal violence trends continue. This comes at a time when law enforcement is chronically underfunded, inadequately resourced, and understaffed across the country. Nationally, the police force has only grown by 30 percent to about 7,400 staff since PNG’s independence in 1975 while its population has more than tripled. Limited institutional capacity, combined with the absence of community-based policing capabilities, undermines public trust in the government and lessens the visibility of the state in many parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With police forces being overstretched, private security actors are an increasingly ubiquitous part of efforts to maintain stability in certain regions. These companies are often employed by businesses, community leaders, and politicians. Some government officials have significant interests in this industry, including as a source of personal revenue and employment for constituents. The official number of private security personnel is over three times that of police officers and surpasses the sum of all security sector forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, government effectiveness is unequal and limited across PNG, with the reach of the state being practically undetectable in some rural areas and highland regions, despite 87 percent of the total population living in such communities. The country’s fragile health systems, limited access to and quality of education, and low literacy levels are barriers to developing local capacity to deliver and monitor service provision. Yet another colonial legacy is uneven and underdeveloped access to educational opportunities in PNG, with girls being highly underrepresented and several districts having very low participation rates. This reinforces the conditions under which citizens cannot cultivate human capital, achieve upward social mobility, and practice active citizenship. Without these opportunities, citizens often look to traditional systems over the formal state for governance functions and public services. These conditions also create a permissive environment for corrupt elites to act against the public good in pursuit of their interests, at times cynically perpetuating narratives that young and poor populations and the country’s political immaturity, rather than their corruption, contribute to gaps in state governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Systemic corruption limits inclusive and sustainable development, fuels distrust and frustration with political leadership, and generates apathy toward political participation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The Papua New Guinean state is marred by endemic corruption, lack of accountability, and the privatization of security, all of which benefit the elite to the exclusion of the general public. Although the constitution provides a legal framework for government structures at all levels, de facto national authority revolves around clientelism. Across the archipelago, most Papua New Guineans identify closely with their local communities and use the wantok (“one talk”) system of reciprocal obligations among people who share a common language, ethnicity, or community. While this system can be a resilient safety net that compensates for insufficient governance and inadequate state services, politicians have also exploited it to serve their interests. Elected officials routinely use their power to capture and disperse state resources toward their narrow constituencies in exchange for political support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2021 Global Corruption Barometer found that 54 percent of Papua New Guineans paid a bribe to receive a public service in the previous 12 months and that 57 percent were offered bribes for their votes. Frequent turnover among politicians and government officials compounds the highly personalized, “short-termism” nature of PNG politics, making what many consider to be bribery a highly normalized part of cultivating a voter base. Systemic, increasingly sophisticated, and entrenched corruption at all levels of government reinforces the conditions under which citizens are excluded from providing input and oversight on essential state functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-inequality&quot;&gt;Economic Inequality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resource-based wealth is not widely distributed, and poor human development outcomes stunt the potential for women and youth to boost economic growth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; At a macroeconomic level, PNG’s positive economic trajectory and resource-rich environment suggest strong potential for international investment and engagement. In 2022, PNG’s economy is expected to grow by 4 percent, driven largely by the industries sector, which accounts for about 43 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). However, wealth and economic opportunities are concentrated among the country’s elites, who habitually engage in rent-seeking behavior by facilitating grants and contracts for foreign companies, particularly in the extractive industries sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PNG has one of the highest levels of economic inequality in Asia and the Pacific. In the wake of the initial stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, recovery in employment has been slower for the bottom 40 percent of households, and those with jobs have seen a significant share of their incomes fall. Profits from mining deposits and natural-gas reserves maintain the country’s middle-income status but are unevenly distributed and rarely enjoyed by average citizens. Foreign-owned businesses and corrupt officials are significant benefactors of the profits of these sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;PNG has one of the highest levels of economic inequality in Asia and the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These extractive industries have long caused friction and contributed to fragility in PNG. One of the most notable examples is the conflict between PNG and the Bougainville region described in the textbox above. Land disputes and environmental degradation caused by the Panguna copper and gold mine and uneven distribution of the mine’s profits significantly contributed to the outbreak of the 10-year civil war. Tensions still simmer in Bougainville, and its connections to the central government in Port Moresby remain tenuous at best. Mines throughout PNG continue to fuel disputes over land rights and profit distribution, environmental damage wrought by their activities, extractive profiteering of international companies, and the limited economic benefits reaped by local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institutional economic challenges are significant, especially for women and youth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; These include low domestic resource mobilization, subpar human development outcomes, and limited economic growth outside the extractive resource sector. PNG’s 2019 Human Development Index score was 0.555, ranking it 155 out of 189 countries and territories. Relatedly, PNG’s 2019 Gender Inequality Index score was 0.725, ranking it 161 out of 162 countries. As detailed in the governance-focused section above, Papua New Guinean women are marginalized and excluded from the formal economy because of cultural customs and colonial legacies, which are reinforced by weak institutions, poor public service delivery, and the lack of gender-sensitive policy implementation. These conditions perpetuate health, education, and employment disparities that lead to unequal opportunities for men and women and limit overall economic growth potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor economic conditions are particularly acute for women in agriculture and for urban youth. Papua New Guinean women are overrepresented in the informal and agricultural sectors, which have both been significantly affected by the pandemic; this will undoubtedly deepen economic gender inequalities. Globally, only 4 in 10 women in fragile settings are formally employed, leaving the majority more vulnerable to economic shocks. Women engaged in unpaid labor are consistently excluded from social protection measures targeted at the formal workforce, and with limited avenues for skills development, they are left with few options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proportion of youth in the population of PNG is large and growing: 31 percent of the population is between the ages of 10 and 24, and 62 percent is between 15 and 64. In urban areas, 60 percent of youth are unemployed, and less than 7 percent are employed in formal jobs. Young people, especially young women, transitioning from childhood to adulthood have less personal agency because they rarely participate in community decision-making processes and have limited access to educational and vocation opportunities, yet are still expected to find formal work in the modern economy. In the absence of formal social safety nets and the informal protections wantoks provide, the growing urban youth population could be an indicator — though not a precondition — of civil unrest and political violence. Disengagement and discontent can lead to increased youth involvement in criminal activity, especially if social protections, educational pathways, and economic opportunities remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant international research shows that youth and women’s empowerment can be drivers of overall economic development, so these challenges — and PNG’s ability to overcome them — are foundational to the country’s development and resilience. Minimizing gaps in human-capital development, including expanding health services and continuing education, could cultivate a skilled workforce that is less vulnerable to economic shocks. Additionally, improving access to production inputs and financial services could shift imbalances in decision-making and create new business opportunities. In particular, a young, educated, and empowered workforce could bring new investment opportunities, creating a virtuous cycle of formal employment. With 67 percent of businesses in PNG identifying crime as a constraint for further investment and expansion in 2014, there are both public and private incentives to improve livelihoods and opportunities for women and youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PNG government aims to address some of these institutional issues by transitioning to a fully industrialized economy, using evocative slogans such as “Take Back PNG.” At the same time, foreign actors are seeking regional influence through political and economic investments. In June 2022, Papua New Guinean prime minister James Marape and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi announced a potential free trade agreement. This development follows PNG becoming the second Pacific Island country to sign onto China’s Belt and Road Initiative in 2018. In 2019, China imported seafood, wood, and mineral products from the region (including PNG), amounting to about $3.3 billion in trade flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vulnerability-to-climate-change-and-limited-adaptive-capacity&quot;&gt;Vulnerability to Climate Change and Limited Adaptive Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PNG’s agriculture-based economy is highly vulnerable to climate change, and women are likely to be disproportionately affected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Two sectors dominate the Papua New Guinean economy: (1) subsistence agriculture, forestry, and fishing, which account for the majority of informal employment; and (2) the minerals and energy extraction sector, which accounts for most export earnings and GDP. These sectors are highly vulnerable to natural hazards and climate-related disasters, including floods, droughts, and landslides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PNG ranks 22 out of 191 countries on the 2022 European Union’s INFORM Risk index; in other words, it is high on the list of countries at risk of humanitarian crises and disasters that could overwhelm national response capacity. PNG’s resilience to potential climate change–related disruptions is low. With highly dispersed populations that are often remote, accessing communities and assessing damage in the event of a natural disaster is extremely challenging. Moreover, the prevalence of poverty, poor infrastructure, corruption, and insecurity — among other factors of fragility — heighten local populations’ vulnerability to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;As with most places, climate change disproportionately affects women.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Female labor participation in PNG is concentrated in rural work, mainly in subsistence agriculture rather than commercial farming. More than 50 percent of the female labor force is engaged in unpaid agricultural work. In addition to ensuring their families’ nutritional needs are met, women are involved in growing, harvesting, and selling crops. While selling this food in local or urban markets generates some income, women lack opportunities to engage in the more lucrative production and export of cash crops (such as coffee and cocoa) and intensive forms of agriculture because of the familial and community roles they are expected to fulfill. Because of women’s reliance on informal agricultural production, their means of food and economic security are increasingly vulnerable to climate shocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, women’s coping capacity is limited because of gender-specific barriers to accessing fixed and financial assets. Although women traditionally have access to customary land — which comprises 97 percent of PNG’s land area — this does not always extend to having ownership and decisionmaking power over the use of that land: Only 1 percent of women in PNG report being the main decisionmaker at home. Additionally, PNG has the highest gender gap in financial inclusion in the Pacific region, with women being 29 percent less likely to access formal financial services. The gap in control over land and finance means that women are more dependent on natural resources even as they have limited agency to adapt to climate change–related threats to those resources and cope when natural disasters strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Women are more dependent on natural resources even as they have limited agency to adapt to climate change–related threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, women have strong knowledge in sustainable resource management and disaster mitigation within their communities. Integrating climate considerations into gender programming — and gender considerations into climate-adaptation work — is critical to identifying and addressing the specific vulnerabilities women face in PNG. Ensuring women’s equal access to assets, information, and services can also increase the coping capacity and decisionmaking powers necessary for climate resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intercommunal-and-gender-based-violence&quot;&gt;Intercommunal and Gender-Based Violence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intercommunal and gender-based violence (GBV) are both symptoms and causes of state fragility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; PNG has hundreds of ethnolinguistic groups, and research shows a long history of conflicts among them, typically over land ownership since 97 percent of the land in PNG is customarily owned. These conflicts have typically been managed and resolved through traditional mechanisms, such as village courts, which were seen as legitimate channels to address perceived wrongdoing in many communities. However, as PNG modernizes, traditional rules and customs surrounding conflict and violence are eroding; elders and authorities who once held power in their communities have seen their influence diminish over time. This has, in turn, reduced the capacity of traditional means to resolve contemporary conflicts in PNG. Rather than invoking culture as a legitimate and often singular explanation for violence in PNG (as is often the case), the authors of this brief suggest that the structural and institutional shortcomings discussed above are more significant drivers of fragility and conflict in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deterioration of traditional conflict-resolution systems coincides with other trends such as shifting gender roles, increased foreign involvement, the influx of smuggled modern firearms, and climate variability. The interaction between these dynamics has led to increased violence and the displacement of tens of thousands of people. Approximately 30,000 people were displaced in 2021 alone due to communal violence, triggering further conflict between resettled populations and host communities despite strong cultural norms of shared land use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rather than invoking culture as a legitimate and often singular explanation for violence in PNG (as is often the case), the authors of this brief suggest that the structural and institutional shortcomings discussed above are more significant drivers of fragility and conflict in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intercommunal conflict in PNG coincides with interpersonal violence, particularly gender-based, sexual, and family violence. Here culture and changing traditions do play a role. Intercommunal conflicts, once fought primarily between men, now increasingly target women and children. More than two-thirds of women in PNG are victims of domestic violence, and one woman is beaten every 30 seconds. Additionally, violence related to sorcery accusations against men and women is increasingly prevalent. Domestic violence has also increased during the Covid-19 pandemic: Between March 2020 and April 2021, the national helpline for those experiencing family violence or sexual violence, “1-Tok Kaunselin Lain,” saw a 75 percent increase in demand. This aligns with global trends, where emerging data shows that Covid-19 has resulted in an increase in cases of gender-based and domestic violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are movements within PNG to address GBV, including the government’s National Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender Based Violence 2016–2025, which aims to coordinate anti-GBV efforts across the country, and the 2002 Sexual Offences and Crimes Against Children Act. These efforts, while important, have had limited impact due to weak state capacity to enforce them. Even when cases of domestic violence are reported, very few are investigated. As of 2020, there were only 150 staff in the police force’s Family and Sexual Violence Unit across the whole country. Meanwhile, of 15,444 cases of domestic violence reported in 2020, only 250 people were prosecuted and fewer than 100 were convicted. The police force, lacking the resources to properly support survivors of GBV, relies on partnerships with non-governmental organizations to fill this gap in service provision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leveraging-strengths-and-avoiding-pitfalls-in-a-challenging-environment&quot;&gt;Leveraging Strengths and Avoiding Pitfalls in a Challenging Environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the previous section indicates, there is significant potential for the United States to address a broad range of fragility factors over the medium-to-long term via the Global Fragility Strategy (GFS). To do this effectively, the United States should be clear-eyed on the challenges ahead, six of which are presented below. It should be deliberate in deciding how to address them and cognizant of its unique capability to deliver on its GFS mission in PNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;six-challenges-in-focus&quot;&gt;Six Challenges in Focus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In ideal circumstances, the United States could deploy the GFS’s whole-of-government strategy and trust that its execution stays true to the mission. But lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan, combined with the complex operating environment in PNG, suggest that whole-of-government efforts, while attractive for their potential, are challenging to implement in practice. These challenges will manifest in at least six broad ways for the United States in PNG:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The drivers of fragility discussed above are complex.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; PNG is distinct from fragile places in which the United States generally operates. It is also unlike the other three GFS partner countries (Haiti, Libya, and Mozambique) and partner subregion (coastal West Africa). PNG is not in a state of civil conflict, terrorism has not taken root, and a significant cause for concern is personal safety (e.g., GBV). U.S. operations in the region will unfold against a backdrop of such PNG provinces as Bougainville seeking various forms of autonomy and independence, as well as analyst predictions that fragility indicators are trending in the wrong direction. This means the United States cannot bring a templated stabilization mission to PNG, nor can it rely on experience from other places. It will need to take a deliberate and iterative approach to address proximate triggers of fragility, structural causes, or a combination of both.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The United States has limited experience, presence, and networks in PNG.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Melanesian expertise within U.S. government, security, and development circles is scant, and the United States has little presence on the ground in PNG. Papua New Guineans place great value on relationships and build trust slowly over time, often outside of formal interactions or business dealings. The initial budget allocated to this work will partially dictate the scale of relationships and impact the United States can generate, but the temptation in new contexts is to rush in with money, ideas, and projects without carefully setting goals and understanding the operating environment. Both implementing partners and U.S. government officials will need to invest significant time in building the community and individual connections that will be critical to any conflict-prevention and resilience-building efforts. Failing to invest in relationships at the start of the process could have longer-term consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The whole-of-government ambition of the GFS will produce a unique set of operational challenges in the field.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The GFS asks the Departments of Defense and State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to identify areas of common interest and collaborate, so their work adds up to more than the sum of its parts. Interagency collaboration is hard enough in environments where there is a need to respond to easily identifiable threats (e.g., violent extremism); it is always easier to address known threats rather than ones on the horizon. However, coordination is more complicated when, as is likely to be the case for GFS implementation in PNG, the goal is to address elements of fragility so they prevent the expansion of conflict and violence. This means the United States will need to be clear in setting out the challenges it seeks to address, how agencies will be accountable for aligning their work, and how individual and collective efforts demonstrate impact.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GFS implementation in PNG involves diverse stakeholders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; These stakeholders will be found in countless time zones and include local Papua New Guinean communities, public leaders, private-sector actors, and government officials; bilateral partners such as Australia, New Zealand, and the European Union; and multilateral entities such as the United Nations and World Bank Group. GFS implementation will also require coordination among U.S. agencies, as well as between Port Moresby and Washington, presenting the risk that U.S. activities do not achieve coherence and effectiveness. This means that stakeholder management and engagement will be a critical feature of U.S. implementation and should be considered central to the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The United States will not be the most significant donor to PNG.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Australia is by far the largest contributor of development assistance to PNG, accounting for 6 percent of all aid spent in 2019. Australia’s fiscal year 2021–22 budget reflects the prioritization of gender equality, committing $120 million to its flagship program Pacific Women Lead. Funding and resources for PNG’s development agenda have concentrated on women’s empowerment. This means the United States will need to determine how to complement existing PNG leadership priorities, when to lead versus support initiatives, whether to finance efforts through existing Australian mechanisms or fund projects separately, and how to foster effective working relationships with other donors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engagement with PNG also relates to the broader geostrategic context of competition between the United States and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Australia-PRC relations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; China has historically taken an active role in the Pacific and will likely continue to do so in the future. Increased regional engagement by the PRC may also shape the nature of fragility in PNG in the coming years. The United States should respect PNG sovereignty and policy but be attuned to the dynamics of PRC operations there and be respectful of the Chinese community’s long history in the country but ready to calibrate its interagency response according to emerging dynamics. This means the United States needs to avoid its penchant for prioritizing short-term security gains at the expense of sustainable peace. The United States should also be self-aware of its own (unintentional) contributions to fragility in PNG, including through the presence of multinational corporations and their operations, as well as the reverberations of its domestic and international politics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-a-bespoke-operating-model-for-addressing-fragility-in-png&quot;&gt;Toward A Bespoke Operating Model for Addressing Fragility in PNG&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of the challenges discussed and to avoid the pitfalls of previous efforts to prevent conflict and violence in PNG, the United States should consider developing a bespoke operating model centered around deliberate and adaptive planning and implementation efforts that creates an enabling environment for violent-conflict prevention and builds on U.S. comparative advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cultivate-a-deliberate-and-adaptive-planning-process&quot;&gt;Cultivate a Deliberate and Adaptive Planning Process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn first, program second.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Time spent learning about the context during the establishment phase of U.S. presence in PNG will be time saved in the longer term. Extensive lessons learned from Australia, New Zealand, and other partners in PNG will be a rich source of guidance for the United States. Still, the most valuable lessons will be drawn from extensive engagement with PNG stakeholders, particularly at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consult widely but prioritize PNG stakeholders, especially those outside Port Moresby.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Operating in PNG will necessitate close cooperation with like-minded donors, including Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, the European Union, and multilateral agencies. But there is a risk that consultation with these stakeholders becomes a proxy for consultation with PNG stakeholders. This should be avoided to ensure the United States builds robust and legitimate stakeholder relationships that are complementary to — but independent of — other donors. Care should be taken to look beneath the surface and recognize that usual “interlocutors” for the U.S. government, such as key private-sector entities or donors, may be critical to some solutions but at times also contributors to corruption or broader fragility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expect the unexpected from the outset.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Change does not occur in linear ways in any country; given the complexity of PNG, this non-linearity is a certainty. Challenges and opportunities will arise, often at unexpected moments. The United States should place a high value on being informed through church, community, and people-to-people networks, finding ways to adapt quickly as contexts shift. Adaptation and flexibility should be embedded into all planning and management approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prioritize diplomatic boots on the ground as a first-order mission, even over programming if necessary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Building and sustaining the local knowledge networks needed to operate in PNG requires an on-the-ground presence. This should be a first-order priority and will enable better USG coordination, decision-making, and engagement. Program funding and operation in the absence of significant diplomatic engagement are likely to be ineffective or even potentially counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mainstream gender and youth inclusion in every program activity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Violence against women is often a leading indicator of insecurity and instability within a state, acting as an early warning for potential widespread conflict. Increasing gender equality generally has a positive effect on preventing and countering corruption and rebuilding institutions and legal frameworks. The United States should look to mainstream gender and youth inclusion in its work to address factors of fragility in PNG within informal and formal processes, systems, and institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;embrace-a-localized-and-partnership-based-implementation-approach&quot;&gt;Embrace a Localized and Partnership-Based Implementation Approach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Work with existing momentum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. officials should identify and cultivate relationships with church, civil-society, and public service leaders in order to work within and strengthen functioning policy architectures. They should seek out and help accelerate positive momentum in local communities. This effort should include aligning efforts with existing Papua New Guinean strategies such as the National Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence, the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, and anti-money laundering frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lead from behind when appropriate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Under the GFS, the U.S. approach to conflict prevention and stability in PNG should bolster Papua New Guinean leadership and complement work by other donors and partners. Doing so is not only practical, it aligns with the U.S. government’s commitment to localization and effective fragility practice, which empower women and youth in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coordinate and co-finance rather than co-deliver with like-minded donors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Co-delivery of projects is good in principle but often challenging in practice. Issues of procurement, embassy coordination, and branding requirements can challenge otherwise well-intentioned co-leadership of projects between donors. While interoperability and coordination with other key donor partners should be a high priority, in the shorter term, co-financing rather than co-delivering will likely be an easier means of operating in-country. That said, the United States should not overlook the possibility of working in co-leadership structures with Papua New Guinean stakeholders in areas of comparative strength over the medium-to-long term, including in areas of private-security sector reform, civil-society support, anti-corruption efforts, anti-money laundering measures, digital development, and peacebuilding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do not avoid structural issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; With a limited budget and presence, it will be necessary to make clear choices about what the United States supports and what it does not. However, this risks focusing on proximate triggers to the exclusion of addressing structural drivers of fragility. U.S. officials should be receptive to opportunities that intersect and extend beyond whatever core areas of focus it identifies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;foster-the-right-enabling-environment-for-addressing-fragility&quot;&gt;Foster the Right Enabling Environment for Addressing Fragility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Develop integrated analysis and leadership among the United States, PNG, and like-minded allies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; For U.S. engagement to be effective, it needs to be grounded in a shared understanding of the factors of fragility in PNG and connected to political and community leadership at all levels. Investments in trilateral fragility assessments, Track 1.5 dialogues, and U.S.-based research institutes’ increased engagement with those in the Pacific Islands and broader Oceania will improve the enabling environment for program implementation and ensure PNG analysts are connected to decisionmakers in Washington, Canberra, and other capitals through communities of practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institute a clear monitoring and performance framework that tracks the impact of work done under the GFS and the country’s eventual implementation plans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Priority feedback on program impact should be sought first and foremost from PNG communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Codify and communicate strategies for implementing the GFS to key stakeholders in PNG.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Local events, newspaper articles, radio interviews, and other efforts to communicate the mechanisms through which the United States intends to achieve its goals will go a long way toward ensuring broad-based buy-in from geographically and linguistically diverse stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invest heavily in whole-of-government coordination efforts to ensure coherent U.S. engagement in PNG, as well as buy-in from key U.S. stakeholders in the agencies involved in implementation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. officials across the interagency should be incentivized to participate meaningfully in these efforts under the auspices of the chief of mission. These efforts should be tracked, assessed, and adjusted as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;leverage-us-comparative-advantages&quot;&gt;Leverage U.S. Comparative Advantages&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emphasize the length and seriousness of commitment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Papua New Guineans prioritize relationships built over time and may be sensitive to the perception that the United States is only engaging because of its regional geopolitical or geostrategic interests. The longer-term horizon of the GFS and whole-of-government approach to implementation are assets the United States should communicate clearly — alongside core GFS tenets that speak to a broad set of Papua New Guinean interests in security, economic development, and international engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lead in areas of comparative advantage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The United States has significant experience in development, security, and fragility that will complement the predominately economic development-focused footprints of other donors. Injecting this expertise, for example, in private security sector reform, civil society support, combating corruption, and anti-money laundering efforts may be a refreshing and welcomed approach in the donor community in the Pacific Islands. USAID’s recently released 2022–2027 Strategic Framework for the Pacific Islands sets out the agency’s comparative advantages as an “innovator and convener” working through “people-to-people programming” and “building institutional and human capacity,” all efforts that align well with an eventual GFS country strategy for PNG. Other agencies involved in PNG should consider reaching similar levels of clarity; however, more important than this is the overall coherency of the U.S. comparative advantage, including the need to avoid individual or uncoordinated agency activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sport the brand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The United States has strong diplomatic, development, and security brands. It should use these to call international attention to issues, convene a diverse range of stakeholders, and engage in policy dialogue with PNG-based politicians and civil society leaders. The sheer fact that there will be a sustained U.S. presence — beyond a programming footprint managed by a regional USAID mission — will be a significant asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take important stances that others might not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; While care should be taken that the U.S. approach to democracy, corruption, and human rights is not regarded as an “ill-fitting” imposition in the context of Papua New Guinean society and state, the United States has a stronger appetite for work in areas of anti-corruption, civic space, human rights, and principles of democratic accountability than most other donors operating in PNG. This may benefit its efforts to address drivers of fragility and offer unique opportunities for it to achieve impact in areas where other donors have not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Establish international precedent for effective whole-of-government engagement in a conflict-prevention setting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. mobilization of development, diplomacy, and defense capabilities should be aligned with, complementary to, and increasingly integrated into its operations and leadership. There is some risk that GFS engagement in PNG is only seen through a development prism; this would miss an opportunity to leverage U.S. security and diplomatic capabilities in support of conflict prevention in PNG in ways that other countries have not been able to do. With an increasing appetite for whole-of-government engagement emerging in the United Kingdom and Australia, this is an opportunity for the United States to set an international precedent for whole-of-government approaches, especially in contexts experiencing fragility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Work the international system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; While much of the focus under the GFS will naturally be at the community level, U.S. engagement with the government of PNG will be integral — as will international collaboration with other donors such as Australia, the United Nations, the Asian Development Bank, and the World Bank. The wording of this recommendation is deliberate; while the United States should work within the international system, it should also work the system to achieve its GFS-related goals.&lt;/p&gt;

They arrived bearing a highly classified intelligence analysis, compiled from newly obtained satellite images, intercepted communications and human sources, that amounted to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war plans for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For months, Biden administration officials had watched warily as Putin massed tens of thousands of troops and lined up tanks and missiles along Ukraine’s borders. As summer waned, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, had focused on the increasing volume of intelligence related to Russia and Ukraine. He had set up the Oval Office meeting after his own thinking had gone from uncertainty about Russia’s intentions, to concern he was being too skeptical about the prospects of military action, to alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session was one of several meetings that officials had about Ukraine that autumn — sometimes gathering in smaller groups — but was notable for the detailed intelligence picture that was presented. Biden and Vice President Harris took their places in armchairs before the fireplace, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, joined the directors of national intelligence and the CIA on sofas around the coffee table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tasked by Sullivan with putting together a comprehensive overview of Russia’s intentions, they told Biden that the intelligence on Putin’s operational plans, added to ongoing deployments along the border with Ukraine, showed that all the pieces were now in place for a massive assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. intelligence community had penetrated multiple points of Russia’s political leadership, spying apparatus and military, from senior levels to the front lines, according to U.S. officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much more radical than Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and instigation of a separatist movement in eastern Ukraine, Putin’s war plans envisioned a takeover of most of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using mounted maps on easels in front of the Resolute Desk, Milley showed Russian troop positions and the Ukrainian terrain they intended to conquer. It was a plan of staggering audacity, one that could pose a direct threat to NATO’s eastern flank, or even destroy the post-World War II security architecture of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he absorbed the briefing, Biden, who had taken office promising to keep the country out of new wars, was determined that Putin must either be deterred or confronted, and that the United States must not act alone. Yet NATO was far from unified on how to deal with Moscow, and U.S. credibility was weak. After a disastrous occupation of Iraq, the chaos that followed the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and four years of President Donald Trump seeking to undermine the alliance, it was far from certain that Biden could effectively lead a Western response to an expansionist Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine was a troubled former Soviet republic with a history of corruption, and the U.S. and allied answer to earlier Russian aggression there had been uncertain and divided. When the invasion came, the Ukrainians would need significant new weaponry to defend themselves. Too little could guarantee a Russian victory. But too much might provoke a direct NATO conflict with nuclear-armed Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This account, in previously unreported detail, shines new light on the uphill climb to restore U.S. credibility, the attempt to balance secrecy around intelligence with the need to persuade others of its truth, and the challenge of determining how the world’s most powerful military alliance would help a less-than-perfect democracy on Russia’s border defy an attack without NATO firing a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first in a series of articles examining the road to war and the military campaign in Ukraine, it is drawn from in-depth interviews with more than three dozen senior U.S., Ukrainian, European and NATO officials about a global crisis whose end is yet to be determined. Some spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence and internal deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin did not respond to repeated requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Milley laid out the array of forces on that October morning, he and the others summed up Putin’s intentions. “We assess that they plan to conduct a significant strategic attack on Ukraine from multiple directions simultaneously,” Milley told the president. “Their version of ‘shock and awe.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the intelligence, the Russians would come from the north, on either side of Kyiv. One force would move east of the capital through the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, while the other would flank Kyiv on the west, pushing southward from Belarus through a natural gap between the “exclusion zone” at the abandoned Chernobyl nuclear plant and surrounding marshland. The attack would happen in the winter so that the hard earth would make the terrain easily passable for tanks. Forming a pincer around the capital, Russian troops planned to seize Kyiv in three to four days. The Spetsnaz, their special forces, would find and remove President Volodymyr Zelensky, killing him if necessary, and install a Kremlin-friendly puppet government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, Russian forces would come from the east and drive through central Ukraine to the Dnieper River, while troops from Crimea took over the southeastern coast. Those actions could take several weeks, the Russian plans predicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FIZPjQM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After pausing to regroup and rearm, they would next push westward, toward a north-south line stretching from Moldova to western Belarus, leaving a rump Ukrainian state in the west — an area that in Putin’s calculus was populated by irredeemable neo-Nazi Russophobes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States had obtained “extraordinary detail” about the Kremlin’s secret plans for a war it continued to deny it intended, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines later explained. They included not only the positioning of troops and weaponry and operational strategy, but also fine points such as Putin’s “unusual and sharp increases in funding for military contingency operations and for building up reserve forces even as other pressing needs, such as pandemic response, were under-resourced,” she said. This was no mere exercise in intimidation, unlike a large-scale Russian deployment in April, when Putin’s forces had menaced Ukraine’s borders but never attacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some in the White House found it hard to wrap their minds around the scale of the Russian leader’s ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It did not seem like the kind of thing that a rational country would undertake,” one participant in the meeting later said of the planned occupation of most of a country of 232,000 square miles and nearly 45 million people. Parts of Ukraine were deeply anti-Russian, raising the specter of an insurgency even if Putin toppled the government in Kyiv. And yet the intelligence showed that more and more troops were arriving and settling in for a full campaign. Munitions, food and crucial supplies were being deposited at Russian encampments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden pressed his advisers. Did they really think that this time Putin was likely to strike?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, they affirmed. This is real. Although the administration would publicly insist over the next several months that it did not believe Putin had made a final decision, the only thing his team couldn’t tell the president that autumn day was exactly when the Russian president would pull the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CIA Director William J. Burns, who had served as U.S. ambassador to Moscow and had had the most direct interactions with Putin of anyone in the Biden administration, described the Russian leader to the others as fixated on Ukraine. Control over the country was synonymous with Putin’s concept of Russian identity and authority. The precision of the war planning, coupled with Putin’s conviction that Ukraine should be reabsorbed by the motherland, left him with no doubts that Putin was prepared to invade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I believed he was quite serious,” Burns said months later, recalling the briefing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii&quot;&gt;II&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intelligence had underscored the promise of Putin’s own words. Three months earlier, in July, he had published a 7,000-word essay, “On the Historical Unity Between Russians and Ukrainians,” suffused with grievance and dubious assertions. Russians and Ukrainians, he argued, were “one people” — an idea rooted in Putin’s claims about “blood ties” — and Moscow had been “robbed” of its own territory by a scheming West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am confident that true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia,” Putin wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just weeks before the essay appeared, Biden and Putin had held a June 16 summit that both declared was “constructive.” At that point, Ukraine was a concern, but one that White House officials felt could be dealt with. As the White House delegation left the meeting, held in Geneva, a senior Biden aide would later recall, “we didn’t get on the plane and come home and think the world was on the cusp of a major war in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Putin’s subsequent publication “caught our attention in a big way,” Sullivan later said. “We began to look at what’s going on here, what’s his end game? How hard is he going to push?” As a precaution, on Aug. 27, Biden authorized that $60 million in largely defensive weapons be drawn from U.S. inventories and sent to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By late summer, as they pieced together the intelligence from the border and from Moscow, analysts who had spent their careers studying Putin were increasingly convinced the Russian leader — himself a former intelligence officer — saw a window of opportunity closing. Ukrainians had already twice risen up to demand a democratic future, free from corruption and Moscow’s interference, during the 2004-2005 Orange Revolution, and the 2013-2014 Maidan protests that preceded Russia’s annexation of Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not a member of NATO or the European Union, Ukraine was now moving steadily into the Western political, economic and cultural orbit. That drift fed Putin’s broader resentment about Russia’s loss of empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a grim actuarial assessment, the analysts concluded that Putin, who was about to turn 69, understood that he was running out of time to cement his legacy as one of Russia’s great leaders — the one who had restored Russian preeminence on the Eurasian continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysts said Putin calculated that any Western response to an attempt to reclaim Ukraine by force would be big on outrage but limited in actual punishment. The Russian leader, they said, believed that the Biden administration was chastened by the humiliating U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and wanted to avoid new wars. The United States and Europe were still struggling through the coronavirus pandemic. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the de facto European leader, was leaving office and handing power to an untested successor. French President Emmanuel Macron was facing a reelection battle against a resurgent right wing, and Britain was suffering from a post-Brexit economic downturn. Large parts of the continent depended on Russian oil and natural gas, which Putin thought he could use as a wedge to split the Western alliance. He had built up hundreds of billions of dollars in cash reserves and was confident the Russian economy could weather the inevitable sanctions, as it had in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented with the new intelligence and analysis at the October briefing, Biden “basically had two reactions,” Sullivan said. First, to try to deter Putin, they “needed to send somebody to Moscow to sit with the Russians at a senior level and tell them: ‘If you do this, these will be the consequences.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, they needed to brief allies on the U.S. intelligence and bring them on board with what the administration believed should be a unified and severe posture of threatened sanctions against Russia, reinforcement and expansion of NATO defenses, and assistance for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burns was dispatched to Moscow and Haines to NATO headquarters in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months later, Milley still carried in his briefcase note cards encapsulating the U.S. interests and strategic objectives discussed at the October briefing. He could recite them off the top of his head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem: “How do you underwrite and enforce the rules-based international order” against a country with extraordinary nuclear capability, “without going to World War III?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. 1: “Don’t have a kinetic conflict between the U.S. military and NATO with Russia.” No. 2: “Contain war inside the geographical boundaries of Ukraine.” No. 3: “Strengthen and maintain NATO unity.” No. 4: “Empower Ukraine and give them the means to fight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden’s advisers were confident Ukraine would put up a fight. The United States, Britain and other NATO members had spent years training and equipping the Ukrainian military, which was more professional and better organized than before Russia’s assault on Crimea and the eastern region of Donbas seven years earlier. But the training had focused nearly as much on how to mount internal resistance after a Russian occupation as on how to prevent it in the first place. The weapons they had supplied were primarily small-bore and defensive so that they wouldn’t be seen as a Western provocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration also had grave concerns about Ukraine’s young president, a former television comic who had come into office on a huge wave of popular support and desire for fundamental change but had lost public standing in part because he failed to make good on a promise to make peace with Russia. Zelensky, 44, appeared to be no match for the ruthless Putin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Math was not in Ukraine’s favor. Russia had more troops, more tanks, more artillery, more fighter jets and guided missiles, and had demonstrated in previous conflicts its willingness to pummel its weaker adversaries into submission, with no regard for the loss of civilian lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyiv might not fall as quickly as the Russians expected, the Americans concluded, but it would fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii&quot;&gt;III&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 2, Burns was escorted into the Kremlin office of Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy adviser and a former ambassador to the United States. Ushakov’s boss was on the other end of a phone line and spoke to Burns from the resort city of Sochi, where he had retreated during another wave of coronavirus infections in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian leader recited his usual complaints about NATO expansion, the threat to Russian security, and illegitimate leadership in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He was very dismissive of President Zelensky as a political leader,” Burns recalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practiced at listening to Putin’s tirades from his years in Moscow, Burns delivered his own forceful message: The United States knows what you’re up to, and if you invade Ukraine, you will pay a huge price. He said he was leaving a letter from Biden, affirming the punishing consequences of any Russian attack on Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin “was very matter-of-fact,” Burns said. He didn’t deny the intelligence that pointed toward a Russian invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CIA director also met with another of Putin’s advisers, Nikolai Patrushev, an ex-KGB officer, from Putin’s hometown of St. Petersburg, who ran Russia’s Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrushev had thought Burns flew to Moscow to discuss the next meeting between Putin and Biden and seemed surprised that the CIA chief had come bearing a warning about Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He almost exactly echoed Putin’s grievances about history and NATO in his discussions with Burns. There seemed to be no room for meaningful engagement, and it left the CIA director to wonder if Putin and his tight circle of aides had formed their own echo chamber. Putin had not made an irreversible decision to go to war, but his views on Ukraine had hardened, his appetite for risk had grown, and the Russian leader believed his moment of opportunity would soon pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My level of concern has gone up, not down,” the spy chief reported back to Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv&quot;&gt;IV&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Burns was speaking with Putin, Blinken was sitting down with Zelensky, in Glasgow, Scotland, on the sidelines of an international summit on climate change. He laid out the intelligence picture and described the Russian storm that was heading Ukraine’s way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was just the two of us, two feet from each other,” Blinken recalled. It was a “difficult conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blinken had met before with the Ukrainian president and thought he knew him well enough to speak candidly, although it seemed surreal to be “telling someone you believe their country is going to be invaded.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He found Zelensky “serious, deliberate, stoic,” a combination of belief and disbelief. He said he would brief his senior teams. But the Ukrainians had “seen a number of Russian feints in the past,” Blinken knew, and Zelensky was clearly worried about economic collapse if his country panicked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blinken’s presentation, and Zelensky’s skepticism, set a pattern that would be repeated both privately and in public over the next several months. The Ukrainians could not afford to reject U.S. intelligence wholesale. But from their perspective, the information was speculative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelensky heard the U.S. warnings, he later recalled, but said the Americans weren’t offering the kinds of weapons Ukraine needed to defend itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You can say a million times, ‘Listen, there may be an invasion.’ Okay, there may be an invasion — will you give us planes?” Zelensky said. “Will you give us air defenses? ‘Well, you’re not a member of NATO.’ Oh, okay, then what are we talking about?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Americans offered little specific intelligence to support their warnings “until the last four or five days before the invasion began,” according to Dmytro Kuleba, Zelensky’s foreign minister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than two weeks after the Glasgow meeting, when Kuleba and Andriy Yermak, Zelensky’s chief of staff, visited the State Department in Washington, a senior U.S. official greeted them with a cup of coffee and a smile. “Guys, dig the trenches!” the official began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When we smiled back,” Kuleba recalled, the official said, “ ‘I’m serious. Start digging trenches. … You will be attacked. A large-scale attack, and you have to prepare for it.’ We asked for details; there were none.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Americans became frustrated at Ukraine’s skepticism about Russia’s plans, the Ukrainians were no less disconcerted at the increasingly public U.S. warnings that an invasion was coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We had to strike a balance between realistically assessing the risks and preparing the country for the worst … and keeping the country running economically and financially,” Kuleba said. “Every comment coming from the United States about the unavoidability of war was immediately reflected in the [Ukrainian] currency exchange rate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of U.S. officials have disputed Ukrainian recollections, saying they provided the Kyiv government with specific intelligence early on and throughout the lead-up to the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet when it came to Ukraine, U.S. intelligence was hardly an open book. Official guidance prohibited the spy agencies from sharing tactical information that Ukraine could use to launch offensive attacks on Russian troop locations in Crimea or against Kremlin-backed separatists in the east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s own intelligence apparatus was also shot through with Russian moles, and U.S. officials were leery of sensitive information ending up in Moscow’s hands. After the war began, the Biden administration changed its policy and shared information on Russian troop movements throughout Ukraine, on the grounds that the country was now defending itself from an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v&quot;&gt;V&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a side meeting during the Group of 20 conference in Rome at the end of October, Biden shared some of the new intelligence and conclusions with America’s closest allies — the leaders of Britain, France and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-November, Haines used a previously scheduled trip to Brussels to brief a wider circle of allies: NATO’s North Atlantic Council, the principal decision-making body of the 30-member alliance. Speaking in a large auditorium, she limited her remarks to what the intelligence community believed the evidence showed, and didn’t offer policy recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A number of members raised questions and were skeptical of the idea that President Putin was seriously preparing for the possibility of a large-scale invasion,” Haines recalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French and German officials couldn’t understand why Putin would try to invade and occupy a large country with just the 80,000 to 90,000 troops believed to be massed on the border. Satellite imagery also showed the troops moving back and forth from the frontier. Others posited that the Russians were performing an exercise, as the Kremlin itself insisted, or playing a shell game designed to conceal a purpose short of invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most were doubtful, and noted that Zelensky seemed to think Russia would never attack with the ambition and force the Americans were forecasting. Didn’t Ukraine understand Russia’s intentions best?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only the British and the Baltic states were fully on board. At one point, an official from London stood up and gestured toward Haines. “She’s right,” the official said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Paris and Berlin remembered emphatic U.S. claims about intelligence on Iraq. The shadow of that deeply flawed analysis hung over all the discussions before the invasion. Some also felt that Washington, just months earlier, had vastly overestimated the resilience of Afghanistan’s government as the U.S. military was withdrawing. The government had collapsed as soon as the Taliban entered Kabul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“American intelligence is not considered to be a naturally reliable source,” said François Heisbourg, a security expert and longtime adviser to French officials. “It was considered to be prone to political manipulation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Europeans began to settle into camps that would change little for several months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think there were basically three flavors,” a senior administration official said. To many in Western Europe, what the Russians were doing was “all coercive diplomacy, [Putin] was just building up to see what he could get. He’s not going to invade … it’s crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of NATO’s newer members in eastern and southeastern Europe thought Putin “may do something, but it would be limited in scope,” the official said, “ … another bite at the [Ukrainian] apple,” similar to what happened in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Britain and the Baltic states, which were always nervous about Russian intentions, believed a full-scale invasion was coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When skeptical member states asked for more intelligence, the Americans provided some, but held back from sharing it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, the United States rarely revealed its most sensitive intelligence to an organization as diverse as NATO, primarily for fear that secrets could leak. While the Americans and their British partners did share a significant amount of information, they withheld the raw intercepts or nature of the human sources that were essential to determining Putin’s plans. That especially frustrated French and German officials, who had long suspected that Washington and London sometimes hid the basis of their intelligence to make it seem more definitive than it really was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the alliance countries provided their own findings, Haines said. The United States also created new mechanisms for sharing information in real time with their foreign partners in Brussels. Austin, Blinken and Milley were on the phone to their counterparts, sharing, listening, cajoling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, one senior European official at NATO recalled, “the intelligence was narrated repeatedly, consistently, clearly, credibly, in a lot of detail with a very good script and supporting evidence. I don’t remember one key moment where the lightbulb went off” in the months-long effort to convince the allies, the official said. Ultimately, “it was the volume of the lights in the room.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;VI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macron and Merkel had been dealing with Putin for years and found it hard to believe he was so irrational as to launch a calamitous war. In the weeks after Biden’s Geneva meeting, they had tried to arrange an E.U.-Russia summit, only to be shot down by skeptical members of the bloc who saw it as a dangerous concession to Russia’s aggressive posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months later, despite the new U.S. intelligence, the French and Germans insisted there was a chance for diplomacy. The Americans and the British had little hope that any diplomatic effort would pay off, but were prepared to keep the door open — if the Europeans gave something in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A big part of our focus,” recalled Sullivan, “was basically to say to them, ‘Look, we’ll take the diplomatic track and treat it [as] serious … if you will take the planning for [military] force posture and sanctions seriously.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each side was convinced it was right but was willing to proceed as if it might be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next several months, the Americans strove to show the Western Europeans and others that they were still willing to search for a peaceful resolution, even though in the back of their minds, they were convinced that any Russian efforts at negotiation were a charade. “It basically worked,” Sullivan said of the administration strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 7, Putin and Biden spoke on a video call. Putin claimed that the eastward expansion of the Western alliance was a major factor in his decision to send troops to Ukraine’s border. Russia was simply protecting its own interests and territorial integrity, he argued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden responded that Ukraine was unlikely to join NATO any time soon, and that the United States and Russia could come to agreements on other concerns Russia had about the placement of U.S. weapons systems in Europe. In theory, there was room to compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while, as Blinken headed the U.S. diplomatic effort with repeated visits to NATO capitals and alliance headquarters in Brussels, the Ukrainians continued their contacts with European governments that still seemed far less convinced of Putin’s intentions than the Americans were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuleba and others in the government believed there would be a war, the Ukrainian foreign minister later said. But until the eve of the invasion, “I could not believe that we would face a war of such scale. The only country in the world that was persistently telling us” with such certainty “that there would be missile strikes was the United States of America. … Every other country was not sharing this analysis and [instead was] saying, yes, war is possible, but it will be rather a localized conflict in the east of Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Put yourself in our shoes,” Kuleba said. “You have, on the one hand, the U.S. telling you something completely unimaginable, and everyone else blinking an eye to you and saying this is not what we think is going to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the British and some Baltic officials believed a full invasion was probable. But Kuleba was far from alone in his skepticism. His president shared it, according to Zelensky’s aides and other officials who briefed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We took all of the information that our Western partners were giving us seriously,” recalled Yermak, Zelensky’s chief of staff. “But let’s be honest: Imagine if all of this panic that so many people were pushing had taken place. Creating panic is a method of the Russians. … Imagine if this panic had started three or four months beforehand. What would’ve happened to the economy? Would we have been able to hold on for five months like we have?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vii&quot;&gt;VII&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early January, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman led a diplomatic delegation to Geneva and met with Sergei Ryabkov, her Russian counterpart, whom she knew well. He reiterated Moscow’s position on Ukraine, formally offered in mid-December in two proposed treaties — that NATO must end its expansion plans and halt any activity in countries that had joined the alliance after 1997, which included Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and the Baltic states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rejecting the proposal to close NATO’s doors and reduce the status of existing members, the administration instead offered talks and trust-building measures in a number of security areas, including the deployment of troops and the placement of weapons on NATO’s eastern flank along the border with Russia. The offer was conditioned on de-escalation of the military threat to Ukraine. Ryabkov told Sherman that Russia was disappointed in the American attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House had envisioned Sherman’s meeting with Ryabkov as “a chance to test whether the Russians were serious about the substance of the concerns … and if there was a way forward for any kind of diplomacy,” said Emily Horne, then the spokesperson for the National Security Council. “I think it became pretty clear, pretty quickly that [the Russians] were performing diplomacy, not actually undertaking diplomacy. They weren’t even doing it with much seriousness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All the Western allies wanted to convey that there was an alternative path involving dialogue and respect for Russia as a great power,” said a senior British government official involved in negotiations. “What became increasingly clear was that Russia was not interested in those.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the United States pursued the diplomatic track, it also positioned forces to defend NATO, all of them visible to Moscow and to Europeans and demonstrating American willingness to put skin in the game. While Biden repeatedly said there would be no U.S. troops in Ukraine, the Pentagon increased pre-positioned weapons stocks in Poland and moved a helicopter battalion there from Greece. Paratroops from the 173rd Airborne were deployed to the Baltic states. More troops were sent from Italy to eastern Romania, and others went to Hungary and Bulgaria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next several months, the U.S. military presence in Europe increased from 74,000 to 100,000 troops. Four airborne fighter squadrons became 12, and the number of surface combatant ships in the region increased from five to 26. Combat air patrols and surveillance were flying 24/7 missions over the alliance’s eastern flank, with visibility deep inside Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were saying, ‘Look, we’re taking diplomacy seriously, but we’re so worried about this that we’re actually moving men and material,’ ” Sullivan recalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With National Security Agency authorization, the United States established a direct communication line from the Ukrainian military to U.S. European Command. The highly secure system would keep the Americans in direct contact with their Ukrainian counterparts as events unfolded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration was also sending arms to Ukraine. In December, Biden authorized an additional $200 million in weapons to be drawn from U.S. inventories — even as the Kyiv government, many in Congress and some within the administration itself argued that if the United States really believed a full-scale invasion was coming, it was not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But every step in the administration campaign was premised on avoiding direct U.S. involvement in a military clash. The overriding White House concern about provocation influenced each decision about how much assistance and what kind of weapons to give the Ukrainians to defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I make no apologies for the fact that one of our objectives here is to avoid direct conflict with Russia,” Sullivan said of the prewar period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians were going to do what they did regardless of what the allies did, a senior official involved in the decisions said, and the administration found “incredible” the notion, as some later argued in hindsight, that “if only we would have given” the Ukrainians more arms, “none of this would have happened.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determining whether Russia would interpret a military exercise or a weapons shipment as provocative or escalatory was “more art than science,” the official said. “There’s not a clear and easy mathematical formula. … There has always been a balance between what is required to effectively defend, and what is going to be seen by Russia as the United States essentially underwriting the killing of huge numbers of Russians.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian officials have expressed unending gratitude to the United States for what it has provided since the start of the war. “No other country in the world did more for Ukraine to get the necessary weapons than the United States since 24 February. No other country in the world,” Kuleba said recently. But from the beginning, he said, he and other Ukrainian officials have believed that the “non-provocation” strategy was the wrong one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Where did it take us to?” Kuleba said. “I think this war — with thousands killed and wounded, territories lost, part of the economy destroyed … is the best answer to those who still advocate the non-provocation of Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;viii&quot;&gt;VIII&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of its ongoing campaign to convince the world of what was coming — and dissuade the Russians — the White House decided toward the end of 2021 to challenge its own reluctance, and that of the intelligence agencies, to make some of their most sensitive information public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. intelligence had picked up on “false flag” operations planned by the Russians, in which they would stage attacks on their own forces as if they had come from Ukraine. Publicly exposing those plans might deny Putin the opportunity to concoct a pretext for invasion, administration officials reasoned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a first step, the White House decided to reveal the scale of the troop buildup that continued on Ukraine’s borders. In early December, the administration released satellite photos, as well a map created by U.S. analysts showing Russian troop positions and an intelligence community analysis of Russian planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis said the Russians planned “extensive movement” of 100 battalion tactical groups, involving up to 175,000 troops, along with armor, artillery and equipment. The picture that administration officials had been developing for weeks in secret was now seen around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of more selective disclosures of intelligence, Sullivan set up a regular process at the White House in which a team would determine whether a particular piece of information, if made public, could thwart Russian plans or propaganda. If the answer was yes, it would then be submitted to the intelligence community for recommendations on whether and how to release it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late January, the British government publicly accused Russia of plotting to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. The allegation, based on U.S. and British intelligence, was revealed in a highly unusual press statement by Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, late in the evening in London but just in time for the Sunday morning papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in early February, the Biden administration disclosed that Moscow was considering filming a fake Ukrainian attack against Russian territory or Russian-speaking people — the false flag that intelligence had detected. The propaganda film would be heavy on spectacle, officials said, with graphic scenes of explosions, accompanied by corpses posed as victims and mourners pretending to grieve for the dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I had watched Putin falsely set the narrative too many times,” another U.S. official said. Now, “you could see him planning quite specifically in [eastern Ukraine] false flags. It was quite precise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intelligence disclosures themselves had an air of theatricality. The initial revelation of satellite pictures could be corroborated by commercial footage, though the analysis was unique to the intelligence community. But whether the public believed the subsequent disclosures depended on the government’s credibility. And Biden administration officials knew they faced a public, at home and abroad, that could be deeply skeptical of “intelligence,” following the Iraq War and the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, the U.S. public information campaign worked. World attention focused on the Russian troop buildup. The idea that Putin would falsify the reasons for his invasion seemed plausible, perhaps because in 2014 he had denied entirely that his troops were in Crimea, an assertion that led to descriptions of “little green men” in military uniforms without insignia occupying part of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given how skeptical some allies remained about the intelligence, the most powerful effect of disclosing it was to shape Russian behavior and deprive Putin of the power to use misinformation, U.S. officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ix&quot;&gt;IX&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 12, Burns met in Kyiv with Zelensky and delivered a candid assessment. The intelligence picture had only become clearer that Russia intended to make a lightning strike on Kyiv and decapitate the central government. The United States had also discovered a key piece of battlefield planning: Russia would try to land its forces first at the airport in Hostomel, a suburb of the capital, where the runways could accommodate massive Russian transports carrying troops and weapons. The assault on Kyiv would begin there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point in their conversation, Zelensky asked if he or his family were personally in danger. Burns said Zelensky needed to take his personal security seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risks to the president were growing. Intelligence at the time indicated that Russian assassination teams might already be in Kyiv, waiting to be activated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Zelensky resisted calls to relocate his government and was adamant that he not panic the public. Down that path, he thought, lay defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You can’t simply say to me, ‘Listen, you should start to prepare people now and tell them they need to put away money, they need to store up food,’ ” Zelensky recalled. “If we had communicated that — and that is what some people wanted, who I will not name — then I would have been losing $7 billion a month since last October, and at the moment when the Russians did attack, they would have taken us in three days. … Generally, our inner sense was right: If we sow chaos among people before the invasion, the Russians will devour us. Because during chaos, people flee the country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Zelensky, the decision to keep people in the country, where they could fight to defend their homes, was the key to repelling any invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As cynical as it may sound, those are the people who stopped everything,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian officials remained irritated that the Americans weren’t sharing more about their intelligence sources. “The information that we received was, I would call it, a statement of facts without a disclosure of the origins of those facts or of the background behind those facts,” Kuleba recalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Western intelligence wasn’t alone in thinking Zelensky should prepare for a full-scale invasion. Some of Ukraine’s own intelligence officials, while still skeptical that Putin would strike, were planning for the worst. Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine’s military intelligence chief, said he moved the archives out of his headquarters three months in advance of the war and prepared reserves of fuel and ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American warnings were repeated on Jan. 19 when Blinken made a brief visit to Kyiv for a face-to-face meeting with Zelensky and Kuleba. To the secretary’s dismay, Zelensky continued to argue that any public call for mobilization would bring panic, as well as capital flight that would push Ukraine’s already teetering economy over the edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Blinken stressed, as he had in previous conversations, the importance of keeping Zelensky and his government safe and intact, he was one of several senior U.S. officials who rebuffed reports that the administration had urged them to evacuate the capital. “What we said to Ukraine were two things,” Blinken later recalled. “We will support you whatever you want to do. We recommend you look … at how you can ensure continuity of government operations depending on what happens.” That could mean hunkering down in Kyiv, relocating to western Ukraine or moving the government to neighboring Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelensky told Blinken he was staying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had begun to suspect that some Western officials wanted him to flee so that Russia could install a puppet government that would come to a negotiated settlement with NATO powers. “The Western partners wanted to — I’m sure someone was really worried about what would happen to me and my family,” Zelensky said. “But someone probably wanted to just end things faster. I think the majority of people who called me — well, almost everyone — did not have faith that Ukraine can stand up to this and persevere.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, warning Ukrainians to prepare for war as some partners wanted him to, he said, would have weakened the country economically and made it easier for the Russians to capture. “Let people discuss in the future whether it was right or not right,” the Ukrainian leader recalled, “but I definitely know and intuitively — we discussed this every day at the National Security and Defense Council, et cetera — I had the feeling that [the Russians] wanted to prepare us for a soft surrender of the country. And that’s scary.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;x&quot;&gt;X&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a news conference on Jan. 19, Biden said he thought Russia would invade. Putin had come too far to pull back. “He has to do something,” the president said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden promised that the West would answer Russia’s attack. “Our allies and partners are ready to impose severe costs and significant harm on Russia and the Russian economy,” he said, predicting that if Putin ordered an invasion, it would prove a “disaster” for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was one of Biden’s most forceful warnings to that point. But the president also muddied the waters, suggesting that a “minor incursion” by Russian forces, as opposed to a full-scale invasion, might not prompt the severe response that he and allies had threatened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s one thing if it’s a minor incursion, and then we end up having to fight about what to do and not do, et cetera,” Biden said, signaling that NATO was not unified in its opposition to any Russian use of force. “If there’s something where there’s Russian forces crossing the border, killing Ukrainian fighters, et cetera, I think that changes everything,” Biden said when, later in the news conference, a reporter asked him to clarify what he meant by a “minor incursion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But it depends on what he [Putin] does, actually, what extent we’re going to be able to get total unity on the NATO front.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden’s comments revealed the cracks in his own administration’s planning, as well as in NATO. Blinken was in Kyiv, vowing that the United States would support Ukraine, in every way short of committing its own forces, if the country was attacked. But privately, administration officials had been contemplating for weeks how they would respond to a “hybrid” attack, in which Russia might launch damaging cyber-strikes on Ukraine and a limited assault on the eastern part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelensky and his aides, who still weren’t convinced Putin would go to war, replied to Biden’s comments about a “minor incursion” with a caustic tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones. I say this as the President of a great power.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden clarified the next day that if “any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion” for which Putin will pay. But White House officials quietly fumed that while the administration was trying to rally support for Ukraine, Zelensky was more interested in poking the president in the eye over an awkward comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was frustrating,” said a former White House official. “We were taking steps that were attempting to help him, and there was a feeling that he was protecting his own political brand by either being in denial or projecting confidence because that’s what was important to him at the time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An aide to Zelensky who helped craft the tweet said it was meant to rebut Biden, but also to be light and humorous, a way to defuse the burgeoning tension. Zelensky’s inner circle worried that Washington’s predictions that war was around the corner would have unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Biden was clarifying, Zelensky’s team tried to assuage Washington with a conciliatory message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thank you @POTUS for the unprecedented [U.S.] diplomatic and military assistance for [Ukraine],” Zelensky tweeted, with emoji of the U.S. and Ukrainian flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;xi&quot;&gt;XI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan. 21 was a cold, bleak day in Geneva, with gusty winds whipping the surface of the usually placid lake that shares the Swiss city’s name. As Blinken and his aides sat across from their Russian counterparts at a table set up in the ballroom of a shoreline luxury hotel, the secretary offered the whitecaps as a metaphor. Perhaps, Blinken told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, they could calm the turbulent waters between their two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They exchanged tense niceties and covered other issues — a spat about the size and activities of their embassies in each other’s capital, the Iran nuclear deal — before turning to Ukraine. Blinken again laid out U.S. positions. If Putin had legitimate security concerns, the United States and its allies were ready to talk about them. But once an invasion of Ukraine began, Western sanctions would be fast and merciless, isolating Russia and crippling its economy, and the alliance would provide Ukraine with massive military assistance. If one Russian soldier or missile touched one inch of NATO territory, the United States would defend its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blinken found Lavrov’s responses strident and unyielding. After an hour and a half of fruitless back-and-forth, it seemed there was little more to say. But as their aides began to file out of the ballroom, Blinken held back and asked the Russian minister to speak with him alone. The two men entered a small, adjacent conference room and shut the door as the U.S. and Russian teams stood uncomfortably together outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Lavrov’s nearly 18 years as Russia’s foreign minister, a succession of American diplomats had found him blunt and doctrinaire, but occasionally frank and realistic about relations between their two countries. After again going over the Ukraine situation, Blinken stopped and asked, “Sergei, tell me what it is you’re really trying to do?” Was this all really about the security concerns Russia had raised again and again — about NATO’s “encroachment” toward Russia and a perceived military threat? Or was it about Putin’s almost theological belief that Ukraine was and always had been an integral part of Mother Russia?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without answering, Lavrov opened the door and walked away, his staff trailing behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the last time top national security officials of Russia and the United States would meet in person before the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden spoke with Putin once more by telephone. On Feb. 12, the White House said, he told the Russian president that “while the United States remains prepared to engage in diplomacy, in full coordination with our allies and partners, we are equally prepared for other scenarios.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;xii&quot;&gt;XII&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day earlier, British Defense Minister Ben Wallace had flown to Moscow to meet with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, a longtime Kremlin survivor who helped sculpt Putin’s tough-guy persona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wallace wanted to ask one more time if there was room for negotiation on Putin’s demands about NATO expansion and alliance activities in Eastern Europe. The Russians, he said, showed no interest in engaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wallace warned Shoigu that Russia would face fierce resistance if it invaded Ukraine. “I know the Ukrainians — I visited Ukraine five times — and they will fight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My mother’s Ukrainian,” Wallace said Shoigu replied, implying that he knew the people better. “It’s all part of our same country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wallace then raised the prospect of sanctions. Shoigu responded: “ ‘We can suffer like no one else.’ And I said, ‘I don’t want anyone to suffer.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shoigu aired a long and by now familiar list of complaints and said Russia couldn’t tolerate Ukraine’s Western trajectory. “It was in some respects incomprehensible,” said a British official who attended the meeting. “Everyone wanted to keep negotiations going — we were throwing off-ramps, but they weren’t taking them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the British officials were about to leave, Shoigu spoke directly to Wallace. “He looked me in the eye and said, ‘We have no plans to invade Ukraine’ ” Wallace recalled. “That shows you how much of a lie it was.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week later, on Feb. 18, Biden called the leaders of several NATO allies and told them the latest U.S. analysis. Biden told reporters in the Roosevelt Room at the White House later that day, “As of this moment, I’m convinced he’s made the decision” to invade. “We have reason to believe that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French, however, continued to seek a way out of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 20, Macron called Putin and asked him to agree to a meeting in Geneva with Biden. The conversation led the French president to believe that Putin was finally willing to seek a settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a proposal that merits to be taken into account,” Putin said, according to a recording of the conversation aired months later in a France TV documentary, “A President, Europe and War.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macron pressed the Russian leader. “But can we say, today, at the end of this conversation, that we agree in principle? I would like a clear answer from you on that score. I understand your resistance to setting a date. But are you ready to move forward and say, today, ‘I would like a [face-to-face] meeting with the Americans, then expanded to the Europeans’? Or not?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin didn’t commit and appeared to have more-pressing matters at hand. “To be perfectly frank with you, I wanted to go [play] ice hockey, because right now I’m at the gym. But before starting my workout, let me assure you, I will first call my advisers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Je vous remercie, Monsieur le President,” Putin concluded, thanking him in French.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macron is heard laughing in delight as he hangs up. The French president and his advisers thought they had a breakthrough. Macron’s diplomatic adviser, Emmanuel Bonne, even danced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the following day, in a televised address, Putin officially recognized two separatist Ukrainian provinces in Donbas, including territory controlled by Kyiv, as independent states. It was a stark sign that Putin — his French-language pleasantries aside — intended to dismember Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;xiii&quot;&gt;XIII&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Britain and France made last-ditch efforts at diplomacy, world leaders gathered in Munich for an annual security conference. Zelensky attended, prompting concerns among some U.S. officials that his absence might give Russia the perfect moment to strike. Others wondered if the Ukrainian leader believed Russia would attack and had used the opportunity to leave the country before the bombs started falling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a speech, Zelensky reminded the audience that his country was already at war with Russia, with Ukrainian troops fighting against the eastern separatists since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To really help Ukraine, it is not necessary to constantly talk only about the dates of a probable invasion,” Zelensky said. Instead, the European Union and NATO should welcome Ukraine into their organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some European officials were still unconvinced that an attack was coming. One told a reporter, “We have no clear evidence ourselves that Putin has made up his mind, and we have not seen anything that would suggest otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It felt otherworldly,” the British official said. In sideline conversations, U.S. and British officials were convinced of an imminent invasion, but “that just wasn’t the mood in the hall.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some in London began to doubt themselves, the British official said. “People were saying [we] got it wrong on Afghanistan. We returned and scrubbed the [Ukraine] intelligence again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They came up with the same conclusion — Russia would invade. But despite the U.S. diplomatic and intelligence-sharing campaign, it remained a difficult sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you discover the plans of somebody to attack a country and the plans appear to be completely bonkers, the chances are that you are going to react rationally and consider that it’s so bonkers, it’s not going to happen,” said Heisbourg, the French security expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Europeans overrated their understanding of Putin,” he said. “The Americans, I assume … rather than try to put themselves in Putin’s head, decided they were going to act on the basis of the data and not worry about whether it makes any sense or not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There had been many reasons to be mystified. U.S. intelligence showed that the Kremlin’s war plans were not making their way down to the battlefield commanders who would have to carry them out. Officers didn’t know their orders. Troops were showing up at the border not understanding they were heading into war. Some U.S. government analysts were bewildered by the lack of communication within the Russian military. Things were so screwy, the analysts thought, Russia’s plans might actually fail. But that remained a distinctly minority view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Kuleba, the turning point came in the days after the Feb. 18-20 Munich conference, when he traveled again to Washington. “These were the days I received more-specific information,” he recalled. At a specific airport A in Russia, they told him, five transport planes were already on full alert, ready to take paratroops at any given moment and fly them in the direction of a specific airport B in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That was where you see the sequence of events and the logic of what is happening,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western intelligence officials, looking back at what turned out to be the shambolic Russian attack on Kyiv, acknowledge that they overestimated the effectiveness of the Russian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We assumed they would invade a country the way we would have invaded a country,” one British official said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;xiv&quot;&gt;XIV&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in the evening of Feb. 23, the White House received an urgent intelligence flash. There was “high probability” that the invasion had begun. Troops were on the move, and the Russians had fired missiles on targets in Ukraine. The president’s top advisers assembled; some met in the Situation Room while others joined on a secure line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sullivan spoke with Yermak, Zelensky’s chief of staff. There was “an extremely high level of agitation” in Kyiv, said a person familiar with the call. “They were not spinning out of control. Just extremely emotional, but in a way you’d expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yermak told Sullivan to hold on — he wanted to bring Zelensky to the phone to speak directly with Biden. Sullivan connected the call to the Treaty Room, part of the second-floor White House residence used as a study, and got the president on the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelensky implored Biden to immediately contact as many other world leaders and diplomats as possible. He should tell them to speak out publicly and to call Putin directly and tell him to “turn this off.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Zelensky was alarmed,” the person recalled. He asked Biden to “ ‘get us all the intelligence you possibly can now. We will fight, we will defend, we can hold, but we need your help.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;

It also attempts to understand the degree to which Rome’s policy positions are shaped by external influences or internal choices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is inherently difficult to demonstrate influence, this paper stresses Italy’s agency in driving the relationships forwards, though it is clear that interference attempts and the economic connections that exist between the three powers play a role in influencing Italian planning. Even if Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 is heavily impacting the relationship between Rome and Moscow, how this will play out in the longer term is hard to predict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy has been one of the leading advocates in the EU of dialogue and cooperation with Russia, to the point that it has been accused of being Russia’s trojan horse in Europe. Rome has faced similar accusations about China, especially after it became the first G7 and major EU power to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with China on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2019. Yet, these perceptions miss the underlying dynamics in Italy’s choices, which draw on a long history of trying to sit in the middle – a consistent practice no matter which of the many political parties have taken power in Rome. From Beijing’s and Moscow’s perspectives, these internal dynamics are par for the course for Rome, where governmental instability has been the norm since the end of the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy has consistently sought to hedge between its close transatlantic ties and its longstanding connections with Moscow and Beijing. Both see Italy as a useful power to support them, given its prominent role in the G7 and as a central member of NATO and the EU. As President Xi Jinping wrote on the eve of his 2019 visit to Italy, ‘China hopes to strengthen coordination with Italy in international affairs and multilateral organisations’. President Vladimir Putin took this further, often expressing the view that Italy could act as a bridge for Russia and even calling for Italy to ‘play its role in normalising Russia-EU relations’, shortly before launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Although this paper was initially drafted before the invasion, it has tried to incorporate what has been seen in Rome’s approach under Prime Minister Mario Draghi towards Russia in the wake of the war in Ukraine (though is unable to speculate about what might come next). During Draghi’s brief reign, Italy had for the most part consolidated its transatlantic and European bonds in Russia policy. While Rome harshly condemned the invasion, Italy’s subsequent push to support NATO, US and European positions backing Ukraine have highlighted the importance of transatlantic relations to Rome and have undermined the narrative that Italy is in Russia’s thrall. Of course, it remains to be seen how Italy (like other powers) approaches the war and Russia in the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper seeks to explore the dynamics between Italy and Russia, and Italy and China. It does this through an examination of political, security, economic and cultural ties to understand the degree to which Rome’s policy positions are shaped by external influence or internal choices. It is inherently difficult to demonstrate influence, but from what is observable this paper concludes that Italy is driving the relationship forwards. Nevertheless, it is clear that the economic connections that exist between the three powers play a role in influencing Italian planning and there have been efforts by both Moscow and Beijing to influence Rome’s thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper first outlines the historical background to Italy’s deep bilateral ties with both Russia and China. It then explores Rome’s complex and multifaceted relationship with Beijing and Moscow in the political, economic, military and cultural spheres, focusing on developments since 2010. The research draws on secondary literature and is informed by the authors’ longstanding engagement with officials and experts in Italy, China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;influence-and-interference&quot;&gt;INFLUENCE AND INTERFERENCE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to define and demonstrate influence, which in its attempt to advance national interests can be malign, benign or a complex mix. For example, the causal links between a business transaction and a subsequent government decision can only be proven if a specific trail of evidence has been left, especially as countries wish to maintain good relations with significant trading partners and will take actions to preserve those ties. While a correlation may be clear, it is hard to prove causality or demonstrate the existence of a deliberate ‘influence’ operation (unless, for example, some formal engagement between governments was also involved). Furthermore, the motivations of different actors and the relationships between them are difficult to assess objectively in the absence of detailed inside information. However, it is clearer when influence becomes interference, which includes meddling in governance processes, actively bribing or recruiting officials, or conducting espionage operations against them. This paper examines suggestions that Italian strategic thinking is being influenced by Russia and China, and highlights evidence of specific interference episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-long-history-of-engagement&quot;&gt;A LONG HISTORY OF ENGAGEMENT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing and Moscow have frequently cited Italy as a significant middle power with which they have deep historical links. Both governments regularly invoke their links to Italy’s rich history, from the deep cultural ties forged during the various stages of Russian imperial history, to Marco Polo or Matteo Ricci’s travels across Eurasia or contacts between the Chinese Han dynasty and Ancient Rome. The history of cultural cooperation is also cited as a key factor shaping relations by both countries’ leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia were part of the Communist sphere during the Cold War, while Italy, despite its membership in NATO and role as a close US ally, retained a strong Communist party which sought to preserve relations with Moscow and Beijing during the second half of the 20th century. While these links were fraught with tension, Italian financiers and investors saw China and Russia as economic opportunities to be explored throughout the post-Second World War period. This history has provided the foundations for contemporary Italian relations as many of the firms, and some of the individuals, involved in developing ties during the Cold War have continued to play a role in relations between the countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has historically seen Italy as one of the friendliest countries in Western Europe. As Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated in 2020, ‘relations with Italy have always been based on continuity, mutual respect and regard for the sides’ interests’. Indeed, Italy was the first destination (outside the former Soviet states) of newly-elected Putin in 2000. Putin has continued to visit regularly, even after the EU imposed sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea in 2014. Contacts with Draghi did not stop in the wake of the 2022 invasion – in a call on 30 March, the two leaders discussed the progress of peace negotiations and energy issues. However, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has strained relations with Italy, with Rome vocally condemning the invasion, openly supporting Ukraine, and forced to look for alternative energy sources to reduce its dependence on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1978, China and Italy signed an intergovernmental agreement on science and technology, which laid the foundation for repeated engagements between the two countries – this was the general pattern of their bilateral engagements until the signing of the BRI MoU in 2019. In 2004, as Premier Wen Jiabao made his maiden foreign tour to Europe, he stopped in Germany, Italy, the UK, Ireland and Belgium. He signed ‘Strategic Comprehensive Partnership’ agreements in the UK, Germany and Italy, elevating relations between China and these powers to new heights. Distinguishing Italy’s agreement from the others was the creation of a high-level intergovernmental committee to help with implementation, ‘the first time for China to set up such a high-level coordination body with a foreign government’. While this was intended to show the special nature of China–Italy relations, China regularly engages in this kind of rhetoric when undertaking bilateral engagements, seeking to highlight the ‘special’ nature of the particular interlocutor. At the same time, Italy’s embrace of the narrative highlights Rome’s desire to show it has positive relations with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;italy-as-a-middle-power-bridge&quot;&gt;ITALY AS A MIDDLE-POWER BRIDGE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China have maintained relationships with Italy which seek to take advantage of its consistent desire to reap the international prestige and favourable business deals that come from acting as a bridge between the two countries and the West. This balance with Russia may have changed in the wake of the current war in Ukraine, which may lead to a reassessment of Italy’s ties with Russian companies and institutions for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a senior Italian MP from the Democratic Party (PD) speaking before recent events, ‘Italy’s view on Russia does not change according to the political colour of the government in charge; what changes is the narrative’. Over the last decade, Italy has had seven governments, all of which have tried to act as a bridge to Russia, putting forward an image of ‘mediators’ – a common narrative in Italian foreign policy and even more critical in the case of the relationship with Moscow. The latter actively encourages this narrative in its public discourse towards Rome. For instance, the Russian ambassador to Italy declared in a 2018 interview: ‘Russia is counting on the fact that Italy, based on our historical friendly relations, will play that role as a bridge with Europe to overcome current tensions … We expect this mediating role to feature during the [next] European Council’. Relations with China are not dissimilar, with Italy sometimes presenting itself as a possible bridge between China and Europe. While it is not entirely clear that Rome has served this role, it suits Russia and China to be seen to engage with an influential European state, given their hostile relations with other Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘special relationship’ between Russia and Italy became more evident during the two governments led by Giuseppe Conte, a member of the Five Star Movement (5SM), between 2018 and 2021. The first government was a coalition with Lega, a right-wing party that until the invasion of Ukraine has openly promoted a strong pro-Russian agenda. Their agenda reflected the economic interests of northern Italy (where most of the companies doing business with Russia are located, and where Lega’s powerbase is strongest), as well as an instrumental alignment with Russia’s conservative values that was functional to his political use of religion, and – according to allegations under investigation by Italian prosecutors – Russian financial support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic element features strongly in the Lega–5SM alliance government’s anti-sanctions lobby. Both parties agreed on a &lt;em&gt;contratto di governo&lt;/em&gt; (contract of governance, a codification of their agreed points of policy) that, among other things, recognised the crucial role of Russia as ‘an increasingly important economic and trade partner’ and ‘potential partner for NATO and the EU’ and advocated the lifting of EU sanctions. In October, Salvini attended a gathering of the Russo-Italian business community organised by Confindustria (the Italian Industrial Federation); he denounced the ‘madness’ of Western sanctions against Russia and said that he felt ‘at home’ in Moscow, launching a fierce attack on the EU. Salvini knew he could count on broad anti-sanctions support among the Italian business community and continued to criticise sanctions until shortly before the invasion. Despite Russia’s obvious support for the goal of eliminating sanctions, the policy circles close to Moscow’s officialdom showed some constraint towards Salvini’s blunt declarations, which did not lead to any tangible results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China–Italy relations also show a roughly consistent pattern. An example is provided in the decision to sign an MoU on the BRI in 2019 – essentially, an agreement to do things together under the rubric of the BRI. Beijing had been keen to sign such a document with a major European country for some time as it provided an endorsement of Xi’s keynote foreign policy vision. In 2017, then Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni (a centre-left politician who is currently Italy’s representative to the European Commission) attended the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing as the most senior European representative. He described the initiative as ‘perhaps the most important infrastructure modernisation project underway in the world today’. He echoed views expressed by President Sergio Mattarella who had visited Beijing in February 2017 when he met with Xi. They discussed cooperation on a new Silk Road and Italy’s ability to help China get into the heart of Europe. Xi specifically referred to Italy as a power that could bridge China and the EU. The implicit trade-off suggested here was Italian assistance with Chinese efforts in Europe in exchange for trade, prosperity and investment offered under the BRI rubric. Consequently, it was of little surprise that two years later, Italy was at the front of the queue in Europe to sign an MoU for the BRI. Under Draghi, the narrative towards the BRI shifted with greater hesitancy and a push to engage with Western alternatives like the US’s Build Back Better World initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the actual signing of the BRI MoU reflects the confusing complexity of Italian politics in regard to China. Signed under a government whose general orientation was to engage with China, the document was pushed through at the behest of a senior minister within the coalition from the traditionally more Sinosceptic Lega, with Salvini’s approval. Italian leaders have consistently shown similar ambivalence towards China. For example, recently, Gentiloni echoed allies’ concerns about the signing of the BRI MoU, notably the security worries expressed by others and the damage it might do to Italy’s standing in Europe and with the US. This contrasted with his appearance as the most senior Western leader at the first Belt and Road Forum in Beijing, and the ‘road-to-50’ vision for China–Italy relations as they approached their 50th anniversary. When out of government in 2019, former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who famously tried to sell his beloved Milan football team to Chinese owners and when in power signed the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership agreement between Italy and China, had made fighting China a key plank in his push into Brussels politics. Even the consistently antagonistic Salvini, once out of office, appears to have had an additional about-face on China and engaged prominently with the Embassy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the critical factor across Rome’s relations with both Moscow and Beijing is that the underlying political orientation will largely be towards engagement. However, there are rhetorical oscillations depending on the political context, related both to the Italian leadership’s Atlantic orientation and the wider international environment – namely, severed ties with Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine. Italy has sometimes become a useful tool for Russia and China when trying to show cracks in the Western alliance. It can appear to be more cautious towards China than Russia, though this is likely a product of a less direct link to Beijing than to Moscow (for example, Italy is very dependent on Russian gas – something that may now change – and lacks such critical dependencies with China whose geographical distance means it has always been a more remote partner). Furthermore, individual politicians have shown more consistently positive attitudes towards Russia than to China. It remains to be seen how permanent the fissure with Moscow will be in the wake of the Russia–Ukraine war. Italy has not seemed to lead European conversations about China (though has steered a line that matches European and US partners), but it has been robust in its condemnations of Russia from the very beginning of the invasion, likely a reflection of the more Atlanticist orientation of the just defenestrated Draghi government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defence-and-security-cooperation&quot;&gt;DEFENCE AND SECURITY COOPERATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy, Russia and China share some mutual security and strategic aims in key regions. This applies especially to Russia, which has stepped into an increasingly prominent role in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region since its military intervention in the Syrian conflict in 2015. While, for the most part, Italian interests tend to be aligned with those of NATO or the EU, there are divergences in certain areas, particularly North Africa, and Russia’s military and defence diplomacy in the MENA region have made the country an essential regional player. As a result, Russia has gained considerable leverage among Italian diplomats, for whom Russia’s diplomacy in the Middle East became ‘if not a model, at least a point of reference, thanks to its ability to have relations with all opposing parties’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libya is probably the regional crisis where Italy has the biggest stake, in light of its colonial past, current energy interests and migration concerns. In recognition of Russia’s role in the Libyan crisis, Rome has tried to involve Moscow in its diplomatic initiatives, chiefly the Palermo conference in November 2018, despite the countries backing opposing sides. According to a politician from the PD, Rome relied heavily on Moscow to make Libyan General Khalifa Haftar participate in the conference, which legitimised Russia’s role in the eyes of other regional actors, granting a sort of ‘Italian pass’ to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to defence, there is unsurprisingly little engagement between Italy and the two countries given Italy’s alliances and treaties with the US, the EU and NATO. An arms embargo with China is still in force due to the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, while sanctions and the invasion of Ukraine have further limited defence cooperation with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a certain level of diplomatic and technical engagement, but defence diplomacy is not a major feature of the relationships. A significant moment in Italy–Russia defence relations came in 2002 during the Berlusconi government when Italy hosted a NATO–Russia Summit, which was used to re-establish ties between the two adversaries. More recently, Italy–Russia defence relations were dealt a blow when it was revealed that an Italian navy captain was recruited by Russian intelligence and sold classified national and NATO documents, with Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio speaking of ‘an act of hostility’ and immediately expelling the two Russian officials based at the Embassy linked to the case. Contrary to other espionage events in which Russia has been caught out, the Kremlin did not immediately reciprocate and instead tried to downplay the event, with Russia’s Ambassador Sergey Razov remarking that ‘we hope that this incident will not negatively affect the overall constructive relations between our countries’. Eventually, the Kremlin expelled one Italian diplomat roughly a month after Italy expelled two Russian diplomats linked with the spy scandal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major engagements or clashes linked to espionage do not play a similarly big role when it comes to China. High-profile security engagement has come in the form of Chinese police joining their Italian counterparts on patrol in Rome and Milan – ostensibly to provide support for the many Chinese tourists that come to Italy every year. It may also be to help Italian authorities develop their capabilities to police the growing Chinese communities in places like Prato. Serious organised crime within the wealthy Chinese community in Italy’s north has been identified as a problem, with links to state insitutions identified in the ‘River of Money’ (&lt;em&gt;Fiume di denaro&lt;/em&gt;) investigation, which revealed that around €4.5 billion had been siphoned out of the country in tax evasion in a system that used the Bank of China’s Florence branch. More recently, police uncovered €200 million being sent from Padova to China, part of a much bigger investigation in which Chinese firms were openly flouting tax laws and using the Bank of China to send money back to China. These scandals were a source of some limited embarrassment to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where defence relations become more significant is in the case of arms and dual-use technology sectors. A report found that Italy and other EU states exported €346 million worth of arms to Russia between 2015 and 2020, despite the restrictions posed by EU sanctions. In 2021, Italy delivered €21.9 million worth of arms and ammunition to Russia. Italy’s defence industry seems willing to find ways of skirting around sanctions. A 2019 investigation accused Italian defence manufacturer Iveco of supplying light multirole vehicles to the Russian Defence Ministry. In March, Italian journalists spotted Russian forces using Iveco vehicles on the Ukrainian frontlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy has had a science and technology relationship with China since its 1978 agreement. Since then, numerous agreements in this sector have been signed, including on the successful China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite, which aims to improve the capability to monitor natural disasters from space. Reflecting the high-level engagement in the project, Xi and Mattarella exchanged congratulatory notes and hoped for greater future cooperation between Italian and Chinese experts. However, Chinese firms are increasingly targeting Italian defence firms for acquisition. In 2012, Chinese firm SHIG-Weichai purchased 75% of Ferretti, predominantly an Italian luxury yacht maker but also a defence contractor. In October 2020, Conte went to the port of Taranto, where he announced that Ferretti (now 85% owned by SHIG-Weichai) was expanding its presence in the port, which was particularly sensitive given the nearby NATO base. This followed a report by the parliamentary oversight committee of the intelligence and security services, Copasir, which expressed concern about the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italian defence cooperation with China and Russia broadly adheres to the commitments and values of a NATO member. But in the defence industrial space, Italy has been a site for both Chinese and Russian acquisition of high-quality European equipment. While the government has sought to control this flow of technology, it is not clear how firmly this is being implemented, suggesting a relationship that is at least one of tacit acceptance or wilful ignorance in some cases. The recent case of military drone manufacturer Alpi Aviation – which was covertly purchased by a state-linked Chinese consortium – raised questions about oversight. While the deal was eventually reversed, there are concerns that some technology leakage may have taken place. This sort of an aggressive policy by Chinese firms is not surprising and is not necessarily part of an influence campaign, but rather is a reflection of the quality of Italian firms. Whether the sales were missed by oversight institutions on purpose, by accident, or as a result of influence is unknown. It is also the case that this general sort of behaviour and skirting of the rules is not anomalous for European firms, though the Italian case of Alpi Aviation does seem to be a particularly extreme one. It is not clear the degree to which the Russian or Chinese state have sought to exert excessive leverage through defence ties, recognising the clear benefits of pragmatically maintaining the existing wider relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economics&quot;&gt;ECONOMICS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic considerations play a large role in shaping Rome’s relations with Moscow and Beijing. Powerful and vocal financial lobbies in Italy actively promote their business interests to the Italian government and drive the trade relationship. Both China and Russia enjoy close economic ties with Italy, with China ranking fourth among Italy’s trade partners in 2021 and Russia occupying the 11th position on the same list. Russia has been one of Italy’s primary sources of energy, with around 40% of gas supplies delivered by Russian firm Gazprom. Although EU sanctions have not yet targeted gas at the time of writing, Italy is already looking to reduce its energy dependence on Moscow. Italy is not as dependent on China, though recent commercial deals suggest a growing penetration by Chinese firms into the Italian economy – in 2019, there were some 51,000 Chinese firms in Italy, of which 10,000 were in Lombardy. Since then, at least seven new investment deals have been inked by Chinese firms in Italy, with a known value of at least €270 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italian trade with both countries is complicated by sanctions and broader issues linked to the West’s turn against Moscow and Beijing. In 2013, before EU sanctions, the total trade exchange between Russia and Italy was €31 billion, while in 2019 (before the coronavirus pandemic) it was down to €22 billion (an increase on €8 billion in 2016). According to Italian figures, total trade with China was around €45 billion in 2020 (€12.9 billion export/€32.1 billion import), which was only slightly up from €44.6 billion in 2019 (export/import balance almost identical). These numbers have been on an upward trajectory since 2013, with imports from China, in particular, jumping by almost €10 billion during the same period and exports by a more modest €3 billion. In the overall scheme of Italian trading, imports from China are second only to Germany. While the volumes are substantial in absolute terms, they remain modest compared to Italian trading with European partners such as France or Germany. Italy’s dependence on China seems to be growing (particularly in terms of imports), while its trade with Russia may now decline in the wake of the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Chinese investment into Italy is signficant. By the end of 2019, there were 405 Chinese or Hong Kong-based direct investment entities in Italy. In monetary terms, the flow from China to Italy increased from €573 million in 2015 to €4.9 billion in 2018 (in terms of Italian investment into China, the numbers dropped considerably from €237.7 million in 2016 to €1.4 million in 2020). The most significant goods for both export and investment were machines, while textiles and telecommunications products were the most significant imports. The overwhelming volume of these investments and exports are from Italy’s wealthy northern regions, with Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Piemonte and Tuscany accounting for around 80% of the total in 2019. Lombardy is the biggest site of Chinese investment and entrepreneurs (around 45% of the overall total). That likely reflects Xi’s decision as vice-president to meet with the president of the Lombardy region on his 2011 visit to Italy, where he specifically highlighted the desire of Chinese investors to come to the region. The strategy of targeting Lombardy (one of the wealthiest parts of Europe) is one that has clearly had an effect, with the local chamber of commerce noting the volume of Chinese firms in the region had jumped by 18% between 2014 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-influence&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INFLUENCE?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to anti-sanctions lobbying, the most impactful public activities are carried out mainly by Italian business associations such as Confindustria, the Italian–Russian Chamber of Commerce and the Lombardy–Russia Association. Prominent business figures also play a role, including Bank Intesa’s Russia president, Antonio Fallico, and former president of Confindustria and the Italian oil and gas group ENI, Emma Marcegaglia, who have publicly voiced their opposition to sanctions. Events, such as the ‘Eurasian seminars’ organised by the Roscongress Foundation and the St Petersburg International Economic Forum in collaboration with Bank Intesa, represent other substantial lobbying and networking opportunities for key Russian and Italian economic actors. But, according to a participant in the 2019 edition of the seminar, the event was more ‘a meeting between the Russian ambassador and the Italian business community’, organised ‘by Italians for Italians’. The participant even felt like one of the goals was to stress Fallico’s role as a ‘facilitator’ for Italian companies and a valuable partner for Moscow. The bulk of businesses and organisations lobbying for scrapping sanctions are in the north, especially Lombardy and Veneto, where economic ties with Russia are stronger: of the 434 Italian companies with at least one branch in Russia, 143 of them are in Lombardy, while Veneto comes second with 79 companies. In 2016, the ruling coalition in Veneto approved a resolution aiming to ‘promote the establishment of a committee against sanctions against Russia, for the recognition of Crimea’s self-determination right, and the defence of Venetian products’. As of 22 June 2022, only one Italian company (Assicurazioni Generali) has exited Russia completely due to the invasion; other companies have either temporarily suspended their operations (Ferrari, Prada), are holding off on new investments (Barilla, Bank Intesa) or simply continuing business as usual (Benetton, UniCredit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a much greater concern about the threat of China’s economic might in the wider Italian economy. On the one hand, in 2019, Confindustria expressed concerns about the imbalance in trade between China and Italy and the lack of reciprocal access to Chinese markets for Italian firms and products. They have called for greater European cooperation and echoed many of the sentiments visible from other industrial bodies in Europe that are worried about Chinese companies overwhelming their markets. The traditional core of the Italian economy is small to medium-sized enterprises, precisely the sort of firms that struggle to compete against globalisation and Chinese behemoths. Yet, shortly after Confindustria’s statement, the Italian government signed its MoU on the BRI – a decision which goes against the view of one of its main industrial representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complaints about Chinese market control and sanctions against Russia emanate most strongly from Italy’s northern industrial heartland. For China and Russia, there is a natural interest in focusing on this part of Italy, as it generates most of the country’s economic activity. The critical question for this paper is the degree to which China and Russia see the economic relations here as a lever, which they can use to influence the overall strategic approach towards their respective countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, powerful business figures have always played a significant role in Italian relations with both China and Russia. ENI’s boss Enrico Mattei was carving out deals for his firm in China and the Soviet Union long before the normalisation of relations. Cesare Romiti, the principal shareholder of Fiat, was part of the firm’s push into China in the 1970s, establishing a China–Italy Institute to help develop relations. Fiat-Chrysler has invested over €3.5 billion into China and has enjoyed an uptick in Chinese sales in recent years. Pirelli’s CEO, Marco Tronchetti Provera, allowed 45.5% of the firm to be bought by the Chinese state-owned firm ChemChina and BRI-specific state investment vehicle the Silk Road Fund. Tronchetti Provera is also a key player in the relaunch of the Italian–Russian Business Committee for Economic Cooperation, a joint Italian–Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs initiative that he has been chairing since 2020 together with Dmitry Konov, chairman of the management board of SIBUR Holding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This class of business leaders is likely a source of influence and connectivity between Italy, China and Russia and helps shape the political view towards Beijing and Moscow. Tronchetti Provera, for example, has supported projects focused on the Italy–China relationship and features regularly in the press discussing ties with China. When commenting on Draghi’s government and how it might change the Italy–China relationship, he focused on the fact that it seemed to encourage a greater European balance between the relationships with Beijing and Washington and praised the return to multilateralism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rome’s proclivity towards engagement with both Beijing and Moscow is actively favoured by Italy’s powerful northern business elite. Yet, this support may stem from their assessments of business interests rather than active external influence campaigns or covert activity. For example, Tronchetti Provera’s sale of Pirelli to Chinese firms caused concerns in Italy at the time. However, it was something that was driven by economic opportunity, with him talking about having sought Japanese or Korean investors as well, but ultimately settling on terms he dictated with Chinese firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;culture-and-the-media&quot;&gt;CULTURE AND THE MEDIA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy has long been a significant attraction to Chinese tourists (generating considerable revenue for the country), though their interest is often more focused on shopping than culture. Russian tourists have also long favoured Italy’s resorts but the combination of sanctions and the closure of the EU airspace to Russian airlines and private jets has caused an abrupt decrease in tourist numbers. Moreover, while there are state-sponsored Russian and Chinese cultural institutes in Italy, it is not clear that they have any broader goal than their stated one of helping with culture and language and what soft power might flow from that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s more significant soft power tools are narratives focused on anti-American and anti-globalisation sentiment; and separately, conservative and religious values. Anti-Americanism is a powerful narrative used by Russia to influence people from both far-right and far-left backgrounds. In Italy, as with other major European powers, anti-American attitudes are widespread and connected to both the US government’s unpopular actions (such as the invasion of Iraq) and deeply rooted country-specific anti-American traditions in some groups such as Italy’s radical left. Over 17% of Italians surveyed in March/April 2022 blamed NATO for the conflict in Ukraine. Russia’s conservative narratives, on the other hand, attract far-right conservative parties across Europe. Despite its anti-liberal and anti-EU narratives, or perhaps in virtue of them, Russia frames itself as part of the European community, a vital member of a ‘true Europe’ based on a common Christian identity. There may have also been concrete actions in support of conservative groups in Italy. In spring 2019, Italian journalists reported that the World Congress of Families in Verona received financial support from the oligarch Konstantin Malofeev, one of the richest men in Russia, who was also involved in the reports about Russian money going to the Lega. The Congress brought together Russian Orthodox nationalists, American evangelical conservatives and Italian ultra-Catholics with Lega’s political support to advance an anti-abortion, anti-divorce and anti-gay agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the media space, both China and Russia have sought influence. Russia has appeared to attempt disinformation campaigns, for example, during the 2019 European Parliament elections, though there is limited evidence regarding the scope or impact of the operation. After the invasion of Ukraine, the EU Council suspended RT and Sputnik’s broadcasting in the EU. Sputnik, unlike RT, used to offer dedicated programming in Italian, but its audience was limited – in February 2021, its YouTube page, now taken down, had less than 50,000 followers (three times less than Sputnik Turkey, for example). However, the Italian media landscape remains vulnerable to Russian disinformation. In May 2022, Copasir launched an investigation into Russian commentators who have appeared on Italian TV programmes and are suspected of being on Putin’s payroll. Chinese state broadcasters have a long history of establishing content-sharing relationships with their Italian counterparts – for example, between Ansa (Italy’s largest news agency) and Xinhua (the Chinese state media organ). Still, it is unclear how effective they are in influencing the Italian public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both China and Russia used the pandemic as an opportunity to promote their narratives, and Italy was a target. Sputnik V, the only Covid-19 vaccine with its own Facebook page, YouTube channel and Twitter handle (at least at the time of writing), also turned into an ‘unlikely new social media star’ through its bold communication campaigns. The Russian Foreign Ministry’s website highlighted positively San Marino, a microstate completely enclosed by Italy, when it elected to use Sputnik V to mark the difference with the more chaotic vaccine situation in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s efforts were more focused on advancing a positive vision of China, and attempting to capture the social media airwaves of pandemic discourse in Italy and promote China’s supportive role. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in particular, sought to highlight what China was doing to support Italy as the first European power to be hit badly by the coronavirus pandemic, though it later emerged some of the videos being circulated and promoted by officials were fake. Chinese state media’s attempt to deflect blame for the outbreak of the virus saw it suggest Italy was the origin point. This generated an angry tirade from Matteo Salvini, and spoke of a broader growing mistrust towards China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has attempted through fairly blunt measures to influence the Italian debate on China. In November 2019, the Chinese Ambassador Li Junhua protested loudly after a bipartisan event was held at the senate in which Hong Kong protest leader Joshua Wong was brought in as a speaker online. The ambassador’s protest drew condemnation from across the board, including the government. Public protests related to Hong Kong at around the same time were plagued by counter-protests in which angry Chinese nationalists chased and threatened pro-Hong Kong supporters in Milan. It was not clear that the embassy or consulate in Milan were involved, though their online profiles were drawn into subsequent online discussions seeking to punish the pro-Hong Kong protesters. More clearly linked to the Chinese embassy was a formal letter sent to the municipality in Brescia calling on them to cancel an exhibit that was being held by Chinese dissident artist Badiucao, which merely ended up promoting the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These counterproductive efforts by the embassy to stifle debate have been matched by similarly uninspired attempts to advance pro-China narratives. An example of this emerged in June 2021 when the influential founder of 5SM, Beppe Grillo, posted a report entitled ‘Xinjiang: Understanding Complexity, Building Peace’. The report largely echoed Chinese talking points about what was going on in Xinjiang and loudly pushed back on the genocide narratives and sanctions policies being pushed through by European governments (including Italy) at the time. With no single author, the report relied heavily on Chinese official sources and was instead credited to a list of European experts, Grillo and a 5SM Senator, Vito Petrocelli, who was then president of the Senate’s Foreign Affairs Committee. It was unclear how the report had been funded, or whom it was aimed at influencing, but it was attacked in the Italian press. It was, however, promoted by US alternative news outlet Grayzone, which has regularly disseminated Chinese and Russian disinformation campaigns. Perhaps more influential was an article published by former undersecretary of state at the Ministry of Economic Development, Michele Geraci, who in 2021 went on a Chinese government-sponsored visit to Xinjiang, publishing articles and media afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia have been accused of working together in the information domain. China has been learning from Russian disinformation techniques and spreading conflicting conspiracy theories: ‘both China and Russia have worked not to spread a single specific story and convey the idea that the truth is unknowable’. Both states are accused of spreading a narrative on a sloppy and patchy EU coronavirus response. Copasir specifically denounced Russia and China’s ‘infodemic’ during the crisis, highlighting recurrent themes such as disorders in supermarkets, the government’s inefficiency, but also explicit migration references, which often manipulated the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there seems to be evidence that China’s and Russia’s campaigns have had short-term effects (such as media resonance, or among individual politicians), it is not clear that it has generated the change in national behaviour that Beijing and Moscow wanted (if that is what was sought). It is possible that individual relations have been cultivated of senior figures which could then be manipulated to China’s or Russia’s favour, but it is not clear that the narratives that are being advanced by the individuals are ones that they are promoting out of external influence or their own belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a G7, NATO and EU member, Italy is a significant player on the world stage in institutions currently hostile to China and Russia. Yet, Rome has consistently demonstrated a willingness to engage with both countries, act as a bridge and consequently potentially undermine Western cohesion. What is harder to understand is the degree to which this willingness to engage is a product of influence campaigns by Beijing and Moscow or Italian geopolitical pragmatism and strategic hedging. Moreover, although it is hard to assess the long-term impact of Russia’s war against Ukraine, Italy’s strong condemnation of Russia’s actions so far points to a rethinking regarding its ties with Moscow, despite public attitudes to the war and the continued interest of Italian businesses in maintaining relations. However, the breakup of Draghi’s government coalition in July 2022 exposes the tensions and divergences in Italy’s wider politics, as well as its relationship with Russia in particular. Hence, it remains to be seen whether this is a permanent shift or something which may yet be reversed with a change of political power or economic hardship as a result of the cost of living crisis precipitated by the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that economic relations, often driven by the interests of large Italian industrial groups, provide a strong underlying basis for the default mode in Italian foreign policy of continued engagement. The web of business contacts brings consistency to relationships that the more variable Italian political system may not. The current government appears more focused on strengthening Italy’s role in Western institutions than its predecessor, leading to greater pushback against China in particular and, more recently, Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the key question is how much any of China’s or Russia’s activity in Italy can be characterised as effective influence or interference operations. From the available information, it is difficult to ascribe Rome’s choices to external influence, rather than a longstanding Italian foreign policy approach of trying to take a middle path in its relations; staying friendly with both the US and European allies, while at the same time maintaining positive relations with Moscow and Beijing. In this context, the country’s industrial class – mostly in Italy’s wealthy northern regions – functions as an influential constituency that favours keeping doors open with China and Russia. There is a similar tendency within the political class, with some groups with more dogmatic views on China or Russia (both positive and negative) making these choices for their domestic political calculations rather than direct external influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, Russia appears to see Italy as a more significant partner than China does. While Beijing is appreciative of Rome’s useful role in appearing to weaken transatlantic alliances against China, the Politburo seems relatively disinterested in Italy – something that is testified by the limited number of visits by paramount Chinese leaders to Italy. During the early days of the pandemic, there was a focus by China on Italy, but this seemed pragmatic and ultimately did not lead to a major change in perspectives. Economic relations appear driven by industrial interests, which serves broader government goals of improving the Chinese industrial and technological base as part of the Made in China 2025 national economic vision and, more simply, good economic opportunities for cash-rich Chinese firms. In contrast, Putin has frequently and overtly sought to use Rome to prove the lack of uniformity in European (or transatlantic) views towards Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper’s key conclusion is that Italy continues to be able to maintain considerable agency in its relations between China and Russia. While it is clear both powers have strong links into the country, and have used Italy as a conduit to acceptance on the wider international level, Rome has seemed a willing partner. This is something that reflects the approach taken both to China and Russia by a number of major European powers. The degree to which these decisions have been shaped by external influence or interference is very difficult to gauge in aggregate, though some individual cases do shine through. However, what is equally clear is that the transatlantic alliance remains a cornerstone in governmental strategic thinking, meaning Italy’s choices are unlikely to ever completely contradict its transatlantic partners. At the same time, it is equally unlikely that Italy will ever seek to completely sever relations with China and Russia – a decision that is driven principally by national strategic thinking as opposed to external influence or interference.&lt;/p&gt;

Senior Russian and Iranian officials have met frequently in recent months to boost cooperation and sign economic and military agreements.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Moscow and Tehran have long cooperated when their interests have aligned, especially in opposing the US in the Middle East, but their recent engagements highlight more concerted efforts to strengthen their partnership. Presidents Vladimir Putin and Ebrahim Raisi have spoken at least four times since the invasion began — more than either individual has engaged most other world leaders. Putin visited Tehran in July 2022, marking his first foreign travel outside the territory of the former Soviet Union since the war began. These interactions reflect a deepening and potentially more balanced relationship wherein Russia is no longer the dominant party. This partnership will likely challenge US and allied interests in Europe, the Middle East, and around the globe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economic-cooperation&quot;&gt;Economic Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and Iran are working to increase bilateral commerce, trade, and use of non-dollar currencies. Russian and Iranian officials have agreed to the following in recent months:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establishing Iranian trade centers in Moscow and joint economic zones;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing passenger flights between Russia and Iran and other aviation cooperation;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing food exports to Russia; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing the use of the Kremlin’s Mir electronic payment system to replace the SWIFT financial transaction service, from which Russian banks were banned in response to the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iranian officials also announced that they were transferring goods from Russia to India via an Iranian transit corridor for the first time in July 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding bilateral trade and doing it without the US dollar are long-standing Russian and Iranian goals. One could easily overstate the significance of these agreements before they materialize. Nevertheless, Moscow is seemingly pursuing these efforts more urgently, likely in response to growing global isolation and international sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran is pursuing greater economic engagement with Belarus as well. The Iranian industry minister signed agreements on automobile manufacturing, medicine, and transportation in Minsk on July 29. The agreements between Iran and Belarus underscore Tehran’s willingness to support Minsk despite international sanctions. The West has sanctioned both the Russian and Belarussian automobile industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran — likely with Russian support — may be trying to enhance its cooperation with the Union State, which is a supranational organization through which the Kremlin has sought to integrate Belarus with Russia, particularly their economies and militaries, with mixed results. The Iranian industry minister announced in Minsk that Iran would finalize a comprehensive cooperation agreement with Belarus in the next year. Iran has pursued similar agreements with China, Russia, and Venezuela in recent years, reflecting its strategic alignment with revisionist powers against the US and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-cooperation&quot;&gt;Military Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and Iran have increased their military cooperation in Ukraine, Syria, and Venezuela in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt; Iran is providing weapons and possibly conducting cyberattacks to support the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Iran agreed to provide some its most sophisticated military drones, such as the Shahed-129 and Shahed-191, to Russia for use in Ukraine. A senior Ukrainian official claimed on August 5 that the Kremlin had received 46 drones thus far, and Western media has indicated that Iran could provide up to 300 total. An unidentified US official claimed on August 9 that Russian personnel are currently in Iran training to use the drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin is likely providing Iran sophisticated military platforms in exchange for the drones. Russia launched a Kanopus-V satellite on behalf of Iran on August 9. The satellite allows Tehran to collect high resolution satellite imagery to support its external military operations and attacks on US and partner forces in the Middle East. The Kremlin may also provide Iran fourth-generation fighter jets, such as the Su-35, allowing the Iranian armed forces to operate a modern air force. Unconfirmed social media reports suggest that Russia is training Iranian pilots and technicians on operating Su-35s. It is unclear whether Moscow has functional military aircraft to spare, but part of the recent Russia-Iran aviation agreement includes sending Russian aircraft to Iran for maintenance, repairs, and technical support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran may have also organized a cyberattack to support Russia against NATO. A hacking group, Farigh al Tahereh, conducted a denial-of-service attack against Romanian websites, including the Romanian border guards’ website, on July 15. Iranian state media has described Farigh al Tahereh as an “Iraqi resistance group” — terminology usually reserved for Iranian proxies. Farigh al Tahereh is likely either the cyber wing of an Iranian proxy in Iraq or a front group for the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). Iran may have targeted the Romanian border guards to threaten Europe with an overwhelming influx of migrants or refugees driven by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and consequent global food shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran could provide additional military or cyber assistance to Russia, particularly ballistic and cruise missiles, in exchange for further economic and military benefits. Tehran maintains a large and rapidly advancing missile program and could help Russian forces replenish their dwindling missile stockpiles with Iranian variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Syria.&lt;/strong&gt; Moscow and Tehran may be coordinating to replace Russian units with Iranian and Iranian-backed forces in Syria. The Kremlin has reportedly drawn down its forces in Syria in recent months to send reinforcements to Ukraine, leaving a security vacuum for the IRGC to fill. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei met with Syrian President Bashar al Assad on May 8, reportedly to discuss transferring Russian positions to Iran and its proxies. IRGC Commander Hossein Salami paid his first known visit to Syria sometime in July 2022, likely to coordinate and oversee these transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venezuela.&lt;/strong&gt; Russia has organized military exercises with Iran, China, and other countries to take place in Venezuela from August 13 to 27, likely as a show of force to the United States. China, Iran, and Russia have increased their joint military exercises in recent years, but this upcoming exercise will be the first in the western hemisphere, demonstrating these countries’ ability to strike the American homeland in the event of a larger conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changing-power-dynamics&quot;&gt;Changing Power Dynamics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran enjoys a stronger position than it had previously in this partnership. Russia has historically been the dominant party, but Iranian leaders have extracted military concessions from the Kremlin in recent months. Tehran has traditionally sought to purchase military technologies from Moscow rather than the inverse. The Kremlin fielding Iranian drones in Ukraine will showcase these platforms to other potential international buyers, further benefitting Iran. Furthermore, Russia has previously tried to limit Iranian influence in Syria but is now enabling its expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Russian concessions indicate a shifting power dynamic as Putin seeks economic and military support from a position of growing need. Mounting global isolation and the war in Ukraine are weakening Putin and forcing him to lean on Iran (and other revisionist powers) more heavily. Putin may seek to benefit from Iranian leaders’ experience operating under heavy international sanctions and building military systems with devalued currencies and limited access to foreign parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-policy-implications&quot;&gt;US Policy Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deepening Russo-Iranian ties will almost certainly threaten US and allied interests in Europe, the Middle East, and around the globe. Iranian material support to Russia may help the Kremlin achieve some of its military objectives in Ukraine and eastern Europe. Russian support to Iran’s nascent military space program and air force could improve Iranian targeting and increase the threat it poses to the US and its partners in the Middle East. Growing Iranian control and influence in Syria will enable the IRGC from Syria to threaten US military bases in the Middle East and our regional partners, such as Israel and Turkey, more effectively. Finally, Moscow and Tehran will likely leverage their deepening economic ties to mitigate US sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nicholas Carl, et al.</name></author><summary type="html">Russia and Iran have expanded their strategic partnership since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

Chinese escalation has precipitated the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis, leading to international calls for China to immediately halt its military activities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;timeline-of-key-chinese-military-activities&quot;&gt;Timeline of Key Chinese Military Activities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prior-to-speaker-pelosis-arrival&quot;&gt;Prior to Speaker Pelosi’s Arrival&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the leadup to Speaker Pelosi’s travel to Taiwan on August 2, the PLA took a series of actions to demonstrate its resolve and willingness to escalate, with the hope of deterring Speaker Pelosi from setting foot on the island and backing up China’s increasingly stern public warnings with action. This included military drills and operations across multiple theater commands, including to the north, west, east, and south of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On July 28, China began testing Taiwan’s defenses by sending unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over Taiwan’s Dongyin Island, a well-defended Taiwan outpost that is part of its Matsu Islands located close to mainland China. This marked the first time that China has sent drones over Taiwan’s airspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By August 1, China placed the PLA Eastern Theater Command (ETC), which leads military operations against Taiwan, on high alert. There was significant movement of troops and equipment within the ETC in the regions closest to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA further repositioned key military assets from other regions to the Eastern Theater Command. The PLA Navy’s two operational aircraft carriers, the Liaoning and Shandong, had previously deployed from their respective home ports of Qingdao and Sanya, and were moving in the waters around China. Large Chinese towboats were also spotted en route towards Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China announced military exercises and live fire drills in the South China Sea from August 2–6. The PLA’s Southern Theater Command (STC) — which is responsible for operations in the South China Sea and some operations around Taiwan — was placed on high alert.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On August 2, PLA aircraft flew close to the Taiwan Strait centerline. A number of civilian flights at multiple airports in Fujian Province were canceled, suggesting that China was clearing the airspace in the Taiwan Strait to engage in military operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these activities caused speculation among Chinese netizens that the PLA may have been ready to engage in some military operation against Pelosi’s entourage if her plane flew the typical route to Taipei, traveling through the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait to reach Taipei. Although it is unlikely that China considered shooting down her plane or engaging in aggressive intercepts of her airplane — which could risk a deadly accident or miscalculation — it is possible that China may have wanted to send planes to “escort” her flight. The PLA may have also considered limited operations against U.S. or Taiwan planes accompanying her plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, her aircraft (and accompanying escorts) took a detour that avoided the PLA exercise in the SCS and flew to Taipei via the east of Taiwan. It would have been significantly more risky for China to engage in military operations to the east of Taiwan given the prepositioning of multiple U.S. military assets in the vicinity and the difficulty of supporting PLA operations at longer distances and during nighttime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;after-speaker-pelosi-landed-in-taipei&quot;&gt;After Speaker Pelosi Landed in Taipei&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After China failed to deter Speaker Pelosi from landing in Taiwan, the PLA rapidly transitioned to punishing Taiwan and exercising China’s capabilities to engage in a range of military operations against the island. This involved PLA live-fire rocket and missile launches on August 4 as well as significant joint military operations from August 4 to August 7. At the same time, China stepped up air intrusions against Taiwan’s offshore islands located close to China, namely Kinmen and Matsu. These actions were accompanied by an aggressive disinformation operation to exaggerate the extent and scale of China’s capabilities. Despite these efforts, and up until August 8, PLA aircraft have not intruded into the airspace of Taiwan’s main island and Chinese military vessels have stayed outside of the main island’s territorial waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timeline below lists key Chinese actions starting after Speaker Pelosi’s arrival. The timeline reflects publicly available information as of 12 PM EDT on August 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;tuesday-august-2&quot;&gt;Tuesday, August 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shortly after Speaker Pelosi landed, China’s Ministry of National Defense (MND) said that it is on “high alert” and will launch a “series of targeted military operations as countermeasures.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese state media announced that the PLA would conduct military exercises from August 4-7 in six zones throughout the Taiwan Strait and around the island of Taiwan. State media detailed that the exercises would include: a series of joint military operations around Taiwan; joint air and sea exercises in the sea and airspace of the northern, southwestern, and southeastern Taiwan Islands; long-range live ammunition firing in the Taiwan Strait; and test firing of conventional missiles in the waters east of Taiwan. Notices warned civilian and commercial traffic to avoid exercise areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, Taiwan’s MND refuted false Chinese rumors that Su-35 fighter jets crossed the Taiwan Strait when Pelosi’s plane entered Taiwan’s airspace. Instead, for August 2, the PLA flew 21 aircraft into the southwest portion of Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), including 10 J-16 fighters, eight J-11 fighters, one KJ-500 airborne early warning and command (AEW&amp;amp;C) aircraft, one Y-9 electronic warfare (EW) aircraft, and one Y-8 electronic intelligence (ELINT) aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;wednesday-august-3&quot;&gt;Wednesday, August 3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By Wednesday, the PLA began exercising in regions around Taiwan. The ETC announced that China had “organized joint combat training exercises in the northern, southwestern and southeastern waters and airspace” near Taiwan and the exercises involved most PLA elements under the ETC. The PLA focused on training for “joint blockade, sea target assault, strike on ground targets, and airspace control operation, and the joint combat capabilities of troops.” The actual extent of China’s operations remain unclear: for example, Chinese media shared alleged videos of J-20 fighter jets taking off, but Taiwan’s MND clarified that no J-20s had operated in Taiwan’s ADIZ on August 3.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reports emerged that China had established a seventh zone for the exercises, located east of the island. It was set to last from August 4–8, meaning it would go one day longer than the six other zones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA flew 27 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ. Six J-11 fighters and 16 Su-30 fighters crossed the Taiwan Strait median line and six J-11 fighters flew into the southwest corner of Taiwan’s ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two Chinese UAVs penetrated the airspace over Taiwan’s Kinmen Islands, located just off the coast of mainland China. This marked the first time PLA drones have done so. Taiwan’s Kinmen Defense Command responded by firing flares to warn the drones to leave Taiwan’s airspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;thursday-august-4&quot;&gt;Thursday, August 4&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA began exercises in the six designated zones. China launched long-range rockets and conventional ballistic missiles from four main regions within China into multiple exercise zones to the north, east, and south of Taiwan. Japan’s MND reported nine missiles were fired by China into four exercise zones, while China and Taiwan reported 11 missiles, with some Chinese reports suggesting only three zones were hit. Video footage posted by official Chinese media suggested that at least some of the missiles were DF-15B short-range missiles. At least five missiles splashed down in Zone 4, on Taiwan’s east coast within Japan’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Japan’s MND estimated that at least four of the missiles flew over the island of Taiwan — an unprecedented move by China. However, Taiwan downplayed the danger noting that the ballistic missiles flew in a high path more than 100 km and were therefore not within Taiwan’s airspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA fired missiles from Zone 1, near Taiwan’s Matsu islands, and fired long-range rockets near Matsu, Wuqiu, Dongyin, and other outlying islands, contributing to concerns in Taiwan of China’s intent around the islands.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s Eastern Theater Command said that it was mobilizing more than 100 fighter planes, bombers and other aircraft, as well as more than 10 destroyers and frigates, to “carry out joint closure and control operations.” Images showed military helicopters flying past Pingtan island, one of Taiwan’s closest points to mainland China. China’s first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, joined the exercises around Taiwan accompanied by at least one nuclear-powered attack submarine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA flew 22 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ. This included 12 Su-30 fighters crossing the median line northwest of Taiwan and eight J-11 and two J-16 fighters crossing the median line southwest of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan reported that drones flew over the waters surrounding the Kinmen, Dongyin, and Matsu Islands on Thursday. UAVs were also spotted in the waters near Japan. During the morning and night, a Chinese reconnaissance drone and another reconnaissance/attack drone flew into the East China Sea, passing between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima and into the Pacific Ocean, and then turned to head south of the Sakishima Islands. They then turned and traced the same path in the opposite direction. Another presumed Chinese drone flew in from the East China Sea and flew circles over the area. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force scrambled fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;friday-august-5&quot;&gt;Friday, August 5&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA ETC announced it conducted air and sea combat drills to the north, east, and southwest of Taiwan to test troops’ joint combat capabilities. According to the Taiwan MND, the PLA dispatched 68 aircraft and 13 vessels as part of military activities around the Taiwan Strait. This included PLA assets crossing the median line that divides the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA flew 49 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ and across the median line. This included 24 Su-30 fighters and six J-11 fighters crossing the median line northwest of Taiwan and 10 J-16 fighters, seven J-10 fighters, one Y-8 EW aircraft, and one Y-8 ASW aircraft crossing the median line southwest of Taiwan. This was the second-highest number of aircraft ever recorded entering Taiwan’s ADIZ in a single day, superseded only by 56 aircraft on October 4, 2021. More broadly, PLA ADIZ incursions averaged nearly 26 aircraft per day between August 2–8, a major uptick from an average of roughly three aircraft per day from January 1–August 1, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Four PLA drones flew over the waters around Kinmen Island and nearby Lieyu Island and Beiding Islet. In response, the Kinmen Defense Command fired warning flares to repel the drones. Around the same time, similar aircraft were detected flying over Liang Island and Dongyin Island, which are part of Taiwan’s Matsu Islands.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the third day of exercises, the PLA focused on testing troops’ land attack and sea assault capabilities with joint air and naval operations in the sea and airspace to the north, east, and southwest of Taiwan. These missions aimed at clearing paths for amphibious landing forces to launch beach assaults against Taiwan. PLA ETC naval forces deployed warships, warplanes, and coast-based anti-ship missiles. Taiwan’s MND reported multiple PLA vessels (later numbered at 14 ships) around the Taiwan Strait, with some having crossed the median line and some possibly simulating attacks against “HVA” (high-value assets).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s Maritime Safety Administration announced zones in the Yellow Sea where exercises would take place from August 5–15. China also announced exercises in the Bohai Sea set to start Monday, August 8, and last until September 8.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA flew 20 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ. This included 10 Su-30 fighters and four J-11 fighters crossing the median line northwest of Taiwan and four J-16 fighters, one Y-8 ASW aircraft, and one Y-20U aerial refueling aircraft flying into the southwest portion of Taiwan’s ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Six PLA drones flew over waters around Kinmen and Beiding Islet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;sunday-august-7&quot;&gt;Sunday, August 7&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the scheduled final day of the exercises, Taiwan’s MND reported 14 PLA Navy vessels and 66 PLA aircraft in the area. The PLA ETC said it conducted live-fire drills in the waters and airspace around Taiwan “as planned.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While exercises in the initial six zones were set to end, the seventh zone (later added and reported by Taiwan’s government) would continue until Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A commentator on Chinese state television said the Chinese military would now conduct “regular” drills on the Taiwan side of the line, largely confirming fears that China was aiming to use the exercises to shift the status quo and make recent unprecedented moves the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA flew 22 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ. This included 10 Su-30 and four J-11 fighters crossing the median line northwest of Taiwan and six J-16 fighter, three H-6 bombers, and one Y-8 ASW aircraft entering the southwest area of Taiwan’s ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the morning, the PLA flew multiple drones in areas around the Taiwan Strait. In the evening, there was one batch of drones found around the Kinmen area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;monday-august-8&quot;&gt;Monday, August 8&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China extended military operations around Taiwan by announcing new military exercises to engage in “joint anti-submarine and sea assault operations.” There was no publicly announced exercise restriction zone and no live-fire. Taiwan’s MND reported 13 PLA Navy vessels and 39 PLA aircraft were detected in the areas around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s MND shared that between August 1 and August 8, China engaged in multiple cyberattacks against Taiwan political and military targets and 272 attempts at political warfare and disinformation. Chinese disinformation attempts peaked on August 4 and 5.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA flew 21 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ. This included eight Su-30 fighters, six J-11 fighters, two JH-7 fighter-bombers, four J-16 fighters, and one KA-228 ASW aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matsu Defense Command reported spotting nine “unidentified light spots” presumed to be UAVs that passed over the Matsu area. The Matsu Defense Command fired flares as a warning signal. The PLA also flew one drone around Kinmen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;tuesday-august-9&quot;&gt;Tuesday, August 9&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China continued exercises that focused on joint containment and joint support operations, such as aerial refueling and sea support. Taiwan’s MND reported a total of 45 PLA aircraft and 10 ships detected around the Taiwan Strait, as joint air and sea operations continued.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA flew 16 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ, all of which flew over the median line of the Taiwan Strait. Eight Su-30 fighters and four J-16 fighters flew across the northern portion of the median line. Four J-11 fighters flew across the central part of the median line, approximately due west of Taipei — the first time ADIZ incursions have taken place there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In response to China’s continuous exercises, Taiwan kicked off a two-day military exercise, known as Tianlei. It featured more than 700 troops and included live-firing of 114 artillery shells into the water.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA ETC announced that operations around the island had concluded. Senior Colonel Shi Yi, a spokesman for the ETC, regarded the recent exercises around Taiwan as successful, “with all tasks accomplished and the troops’ combat capabilities in integrated joint operations effectively verified.” However, the PLA will continue to monitor the region, conduct military training and preparations, and regularly organize combat patrols in the Taiwan Strait, as China intends to maintain its presence in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of the PLA’s operations, the Taiwan MND reported 10 PLA Navy vessels and 36 PLA aircraft around the area of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA flew 17 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ, all of which crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait. This included nine SU-30 fighters crossing near the center of the line (but further north than the preceding day’s incursion) and eight J-11 fighters crossing toward the southern portion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;thursday-august-11&quot;&gt;Thursday, August 11&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite China’s official conclusion of the exercises around the island, Taiwan’s MND reported 6 PLA Navy vessels and 21 PLA aircraft around the island.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA flew 11 aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ. One JH-7 and six Su-30 flew over the northern portion of the median line and 11 J-4 aircraft flew over the median line to the southwest of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mapping-the-plas-unprecedented-six-exercise-zones-around-taiwan&quot;&gt;Mapping the PLA’s Unprecedented Six Exercise Zones around Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the various Chinese activities detailed above, the most significant to date is a series of large military exercises and live-fire drills that took place from August 4-7. As a whole, these exercises are much closer to the main island of Taiwan than prior ones, showcasing the PLA’s increased confidence in its capabilities to operate near Taiwan. The six exercise zones are within Taiwan’s ADIZ and encircle Taiwan from multiple directions. Several exercise zones are far from the Chinese mainland and beyond the Taiwan Strait, venturing into Japan’s and the Philippine’s EEZ. Three of the exercise zones intrude into Taiwan’s territorial waters and lie dangerously close to Taiwan’s capital and key cities. It is also worth noting that these exercises were rolled out at once, while the exercises during the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis took place in multiple stages from July 1995 to March 1996.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MH0Tf1V.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Chinese Military Exercises around Taiwan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statements by Chinese military analysts have made clear that the PLA chose the location of each exercise zone for specific purposes. Below are details on the importance of each zone to PLA operations and to Taiwan’s security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zone 1:&lt;/strong&gt; This zone is positioned off the coast of mainland China’s Pingtan Island at the narrowest part of the Taiwan Strait. It is also close to the Taiwan-controlled Matsu Islands that sit immediately off the coast of mainland China’s Fujian Province. PLA operations there could signal Chinese threats to seize the offshore islands. PLA analysts have noted that operations by this narrow neck could position China to close off the northern entrance to the Taiwan Strait. This zone was also chosen to intentionally breach and undermine the legitimacy of the “median line” running through the Taiwan Strait, where PLA forces typically operate to the west of the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zone 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Located north of Taiwan, this zone intrudes into Taiwan’s territorial waters and is 22.5 kilometers (km) away from the tip of the island and approximately 50 km from Taipei, Taiwan’s capital. It is near both the Port of Taipei and Keelung Harbor, a key port for both military and commercial activity. Both ports are critical to Taiwan’s economy and together handle approximately 20 percent of total cargo to the island. Zone 2 is also located near Taipei’s Taoyuan International Airport, the island’s busiest airport, as well as Taipei Songshan Airport, which serves as a military airbase and saw over six million passengers in 2019. This zone is located close to beaches and coastal areas to the northwest and west of Taipei that military planners believe to be suitable for a potential PLA amphibious landing on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zone 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Located 18.5 km northeast of Taiwan, this zone is near the only beaches on the east coast of Taiwan that may be suitable for a PLA amphibious invasion. The southeast corner of Zone 3 intrudes into Japan’s EEZ and is a short distance from the hotly contested Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, which are administered by Japan and claimed by China and Taiwan. Zone 3 thus further positions the PLA to conduct operations against both Taiwan and Japan. Similar to Zone 2, this zone is close to Taipei and Keelung Harbor. Control of both zones could make it difficult for the United States or Japan to flow forces into Taipei from the northeast side and could enable the PLA to blockade Keelung Harbor. Operating from Zones 1, 2, and 3 could allow the PLA to move quickly to seize Taipei from three different directions and may be particularly important if the PLA seeks to engage in a decapitation attack against Taiwan’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zone 4:&lt;/strong&gt; This zone rests approximately 130 km from Taiwan’s eastern shores in the Pacific Ocean. Because of the distance to China and relatively mountainous terrain on Taiwan’s east coast, the PLA has historically engaged in fewer operations and exercises in this region than on the western side of Taiwan. This zone directly faces two air force bases at Hualien and Taitung, which are among Taiwan’s most important military bases. Placing forces there would enable the PLA to launch attacks on Taiwan’s eastern shores and bases and help deny the United States and other countries from flowing forces into Taiwan from the east. This zone also overlaps with Japan’s EEZ. Sandwiched between this zone and Zone 3 is Japan’s Yonaguni Island, which hosts a military base, radar, and other equipment and serves as a critical outpost near Taiwan and the Senkaku Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zone 5:&lt;/strong&gt; This zone is positioned southeast of the southern tip of Taiwan. It sits between Taiwan’s Orchid Island and the islands comprising the Philippine Province of Batanes and intrudes into the Philippine EEZ. This stretch of seas, known as the Bashi Channel, is a critical choke point separating waters within the First Island Chain from the Philippines Sea and the broader Pacific Ocean. The Bashi Channel is also home to several undersea cables, which could be severed to severely disrupt internet access and communications in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zone 6:&lt;/strong&gt; This zone is located at the southwest corner of Taiwan and is the largest of the six. It is close to a region that has been a stronghold of the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), the party that President Tsai Ing-wen leads and Beijing views as pushing for Taiwan independence. The southwest corner of Taiwan’s ADIZ is where the PLA has engaged in the most air intrusions, but typically at a distance much farther from the main island of Taiwan than the exercise zone. This zone reaches into Taiwan’s territorial waters, near the large cities of Kaohsiung and Zuoying, which are both home to key military bases. Kaohsiung also boasts Taiwan’s most important commercial port — which handled nearly 59 percent of Taiwan’s total shipping throughput in 2021 — and Taiwan’s second-busiest airport. Similar to the zones in northern Taiwan, this zone is close to beaches and coastal areas suitable for an amphibious invasion of Taiwan. Military operations from Zone 6 could target DPP supporters, significantly undermine Taiwan’s economy (as part of a blockade), and support a potential invasion of the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-significance-of-the-plas-exercises&quot;&gt;The Significance of the PLA’s Exercises&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These unprecedented exercises serve at least four main objectives. First, they are intended to impose political costs on Taipei and undermine morale and support for Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen among Taiwan’s public. Part of this involves making clear that Taiwan will bear the brunt of Chinese punishment for closer relations with the United States. Beijing hopes that this will drive a wedge between Taipei and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, these exercises are part of larger Chinese deterrence and signaling efforts toward the United States, Taiwan, U.S. regional allies, and the broader international community to demonstrate how capable and determined China is to exert control over Taiwan and enforce its One China Principle. The exercises involve direct costs for Japan, and to some extent the Philippines, because of PLA operations (and firing of missiles) within both countries’ claimed waters. PLA activities are also meant to deter countries from supporting Taiwan by showcasing how much China is willing to escalate. More broadly, the PLA exercise led to rerouting of commercial air and maritime traffic around Taiwan to avoid the exercise zones, demonstrating China’s ability to “control” activities near and around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA’s decision to ambiguously extend (and then end) parts of the exercises also fit into China’s playbook for using military exercises for deterrence signaling. Science of Military Strategy, a relatively authoritative textbook published by China’s National Defense University, highlights PLA strategic thinking on the role of exercises in creating confusion and uncertainty. It states exercises can be directed at adversaries with the goal of “making them uncertain about our intentions and making it difficult to determine whether we are conducting routine training, maintaining close diplomatic relations, or taking the opportunity to move into actual combat operations, thereby causing psychological panic and conduct a deterrent effect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, these exercises allow the PLA to rehearse how to conduct a variety of military operations that could form part of a larger-scale military operation - such as seizing one of Taiwan’s offshore islands or PLA blockade or invasion of the main Taiwan island - or a standalone operation by itself. This includes not only activities directed at Taiwan, but operations to prevent potential third country intervention in a China-Taiwan conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, and longer term, Beijing aims to use the exercises to establish a new status quo in the Taiwan Strait. China is specifically seeking to erase the notion of the median line that divides the strait and aims to constrain PLA operations west of the line. China also seeks to establish a new normal in which the PLA no longer respects Taiwan’s claims to a separate airspace and territorial waters. These exercises are likely only the beginning of PLA operations close to and above Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-2022-white-paper-on-taiwan&quot;&gt;China’s 2022 White Paper on Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 10, 2022, the Chinese government published a white paper titled “The Taiwan Question and China’s Reunification in the New Era.” The white paper has been under development for some time, and it was released to coincide with and mark the ending of China’s unprecedented August 2022 military exercises. As a result, it serves as a powerful Chinese messaging tool to explain why China escalated with military force and what to expect from China’s policy toward Taiwan moving forward, including further changes to come after China’s 20th Party Congress, which is set to be held this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The white paper sought to convey that China’s overall policy toward Taiwan has not changed — that China remains committed to peaceful unification and “one country, two systems” despite the escalation of military force against Taiwan. Even as the PLA seeks to establish a “new normal” of military operations closer to Taiwan, Beijing is trying to signal that China would prefer to resolve the Taiwan question without use of significant military force. In other words, the August 2022 exercises is an example of China having no choice but to use military force to fight Taiwan separatism and external interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A detailed reading of this new white paper, however, shows mixed messages about China’s willingness to use force. The white paper also reflects Beijing’s toughened positions against Taiwan, and it no longer contains guarantees that Taiwan can maintain its democracy or military post-unification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-new-in-the-white-paper&quot;&gt;What Is New in the White Paper&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The white paper represents authoritative and official Chinese policy toward Taiwan under President Xi Jinping. It is the latest Chinese white paper on Taiwan that follows two prior white papers in 1993 and 2000. There are significant differences between the 2022 and 2000 white papers that reflect the influence of three Chinese leaders — Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, and Xi Jinping — on China’s Taiwan policy. The new white paper also demonstrates that cross-Strait dynamics and the balance of power have shifted drastically in the last two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 white paper defines resolving the Taiwan question and realizing China’s “complete unification” as a “historic mission.” Although Jiang and Hu have used the term complete unification to characterize the desired end state for Taiwan, both leaders generally placed more emphasis on peaceful or national unification in their speeches and white papers. Under Xi Jinping, there are increased references to complete unification. The 2000 white paper did not use the term historic mission and this term suggests Xi’s elevation of the importance of unification, the importance of making progress on unification, and linking of unification with “national rejuvenation,” which was also absent from the 2000 white paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 white paper clarifies that China’s national development and progress set the direction of cross-Strait relations (and unification). Broadly increasing people-to-people contacts and economic and cultural exchanges between the two sides is no longer sufficient to drive cross-Strait relations in the direction that Beijing wants. China must rely on its growing political, economic, technological, and military power to shape and coerce Taiwan’s trajectory. To some extent, this also suggests that China is not in a hurry or rush to achieve unification because its growing power could give China even more advantage in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new white paper specifies “use of force would be the last resort taken under compelling circumstances.” This sentence was an addition that was not in the 2000 Taiwan white paper or the 2005 Anti-Secession Law. Because China already engages in near daily military operations against Taiwan, this sentence likely refers to either kinetic or larger-scale use of military force, which Beijing demonstrated with its August 2022 exercises. Although this sentence suggests that China should be less willing to use significant military force, it must be paired with other portions of the white paper that warn of the dangers posed by active separatist forces on Taiwan and prominent external interference (namely, the United States). The document urges China to have the courage, skill, extensive unity, and solidarity “to mobilize all factors to fight,” with “fight” referring to leveraging the range of Chinese capabilities, including military means. In other words, there are likely to be more instances of “compelling circumstances” and, if diplomacy does not work, China may have to use military force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of what Taiwan can expect after unification, the new white paper writes that China’s principles of peaceful unification and One Country, Two Systems “take full account of Taiwan’s realities and are conducive to long-term stability in Taiwan after unification.” The addition of long-term stability suggests that Beijing wants to avoid the “instability” it suffered from the massive protests in Hong Kong. Beijing must be able to impose a sufficient degree of control over Taiwan to ensure there is no repeat of Hong Kong in Taiwan. The document offers that, “Provided that China’s sovereignty, security, and development interests are guaranteed, after unification Taiwan will enjoy a high degree of autonomy as a special administrative region.” This means that Taiwan’s autonomy is highly conditioned. This is a far cry from the 2000 white paper that laid out what Taiwan could enjoy after unification without stipulating the conditions under which Beijing might revoke such offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-missing-from-the-white-paper&quot;&gt;What Is Missing from the White Paper&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 white paper is missing a host of key items that illustrate China’s toughening position against Taiwan and the degree of control Beijing will need to exert over the island:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most tellingly, the English version of the document does not mention the word “negotiate” when describing how the two sides can proceed to unification. It notes that there will be “consultations and discussions as equals.” The Chinese version of the white paper still uses “谈判” (negotiate) — but only in three areas — and there is no mention of “平等谈判” (negotiations as equals). The lack of explanation of what “as equals” means, and the refusal to link that term with negotiation, raise serious questions of how Beijing views Taipei and whether Taipei — or perhaps the specific DPP leadership — will be allowed any room for bargaining.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, the 2022 white paper is missing this key passage from the 2000 white paper: “[N]egotiations should be held between the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese KMT on a reciprocal basis and… talks between the two parties may include representatives from all parties and mass organizations of Taiwan.” The 2000 white paper also noted that “we [Beijing] have never spoken of negotiations between the ‘central and local authorities.’” The exclusion of that statement in the 2022 text raises key questions about whether Beijing will view the DPP (or any Taiwan party) as an equal or subordinate for unification talks. If it is the latter, Beijing may seek to impose its will on Taipei than allow for genuine negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The white paper only guarantees that Taiwan can maintain its own social and economic system under the One Country, Two Systems formula. Gone are assurances in the 1993 and 2000 white papers about a host of other rights that Taiwan could enjoy after unification that would allow the island to continue functioning as a vibrant democracy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Missing: Taiwan “will have its own administrative and legislative powers”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Missing: Taiwan will maintain “an independent judiciary and the right of adjudication on the island”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Missing: Taiwan “will run its own party, political, military, economic, and financial affairs”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Missing: Taiwan “may keep its military forces and the mainland will not dispatch troops or administrative personnel to the island”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Missing: “Representatives of the government of the special administrative region and those from different circles of Taiwan may be appointed to senior posts in the central government and participate in the running of national affairs.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, in Beijing’s ideal world, Taiwan would be governed by patriots who are loyal and subordinate to Beijing. The white paper makes this clear, concluding: “All Taiwan compatriots who support reunification of the country and rejuvenation of the nation will be the masters of the region, contributing to and benefitting from China’s development.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bonny Lin, et al.</name></author><summary type="html">As U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi traveled to Taiwan on August 2-3, China responded with forceful and coercive military, economic, and diplomatic measures.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/caylwb3.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/caylwb3.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Silicon Lifeline In Ukraine War</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-08-08-silicon-lifeline-in-ukraine-war.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Silicon Lifeline In Ukraine War" /><published>2022-08-08T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-08-08T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/silicon-lifeline-in-ukraine-war</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-08-08-silicon-lifeline-in-ukraine-war.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An examination of the components and functioning of 27 of Russia’s most modern military systems – including cruise missiles, communications systems and electronic warfare complexes – supports that the degradation in Russian military capability could be made permanent if appropriate policies are implemented.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Russia invaded Ukraine, the West announced tough new sanctions and tech companies said they had halted all exports to Russia. Yet supplies of Western computer parts continued, a joint investigation finds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the tip of a hunting knife, a senior Ukrainian security official removed 18 screws and lifted off the lid of a small black metal box. Inside were four sliding panels packed with scores of computer chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the electronic brain of an unexploded Russian 9M727 cruise missile — one of the devastating weapons Russia has used to strike Ukraine since it invaded the country on Feb. 24. Russian troops have fired more than 3,650 missiles and guided rockets in the first five months of the war, according to Ukrainian authorities, destroying military targets as well as apartment buildings, shopping centers, and killing hundreds of civilians. On July 14, three cruise missiles struck the city of Vinnytsia, killing 27 people, including a four-year-old girl, Ukrainian authorities say. Russia says it only fires at military targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The black metal box, as well as other Russian weaponry shown to Reuters, were collected on the battlefield by Ukraine’s military. They contain Russian electronics bearing Cyrillic markings, sometimes handwritten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But many of the most important electronic components inside are microcontrollers, programmable chips and signal processors stamped with the names of American chip-makers, including Texas Instruments Inc; Altera, owned by Intel Corp; Xilinx, owned by Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD); and Maxim Integrated Products Inc, acquired last year by Analog Devices Inc. Chips made by Cypress Semiconductor, now owned by Germany’s Infineon AG, were also visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fqNibeV.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A radio altimeter, used in the Kalibr and 9M727 Iskander missiles, enabling them to hug terrain. The altimeter pictured was recovered by Ukraine’s military and contains Altera chips.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s quite simple,” said the senior Ukrainian official, who requested anonymity for security reasons. “Without those U.S. chips, Russian missiles and most Russian weapons would not work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Western components in the Russian weapons were examined as part of an investigation by Reuters in collaboration with the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a London-based defense think tank, and iStories, a Russia-focused investigative news site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some of the more sophisticated Western chips in the Russian weapons have been subject to special export licensing requirements for years, the investigation found that many of the armaments also contain run-of-the-mill computer chips and other components found in consumer products. These are easily obtainable and in many cases aren’t subject to export restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the invasion, the United States and other countries banned high-tech exports to Russia to try to cripple its defense industry and tech companies announced that they had halted all exports to Russia. Yet the reporting team found that the flow of Western brand-name computer parts to Russia hasn’t stopped, with thousands of shipments since the invasion of Ukraine. The shippers were mainly unauthorized suppliers, but they also included some manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reuters provided to AMD, Analog Devices, Infineon, Intel and Texas Instruments data from Russian customs records on shipments of their products to Russia that arrived after the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three of the manufacturers – AMD, Analog Devices and Infineon – said they had launched internal investigations after Reuters provided the customs data showing thousands of recent shipments of their products to Russia by third-party sellers. Infineon and Texas Instruments said products that they had shipped were already in transit at the time of the invasion. Intel said goods it shipped were internal company deliveries before it ceased its Russian operations in early April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about their chips’ use in Russian weapons systems, the companies said they comply with export controls and trade sanctions. Infineon said it was “deeply concerned should our products be used for purposes for which they were not designed.” Intel said it “does not support or tolerate our products being used to violate human rights.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s reliance on Western electronics for its weapon systems has been known for years. Moscow has a long history of acquiring smuggled military-grade parts from the United States, including costly specialized chips for satellites that can withstand radiation in space. On the day of the invasion, the White House announced that the United States and its allies were imposing “Russia-wide restrictions on semiconductors, telecommunication, encryption security, lasers, sensors, navigation, avionics and maritime technologies” that it said would “cut off Russia’s access to cutting edge technology.” Many non-military tech products, however, remain exempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia characterizes the conflict as a special military operation meant to disarm Ukraine. Moscow has cast the sanctions as a hostile act and has denied targeting civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Commerce, which administers export restrictions, said, “The powerful export controls put in place by the U.S. and 37 allies and partners are severely impacting Russia’s access to items and technologies it needs to sustain its military aggression, including semiconductors. As time goes on and their stockpiles continue to diminish, our controls will bite even harder.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We will remain vigilant and engaged with our allies and partners in enforcing our controls,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;microwave-oven-chips&quot;&gt;Microwave-oven chips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The onboard computer system inside the cruise missile’s black metal box shows that Russia doesn’t just rely on state-of-the-art technology for its precision weaponry. For example, stamps on two of the Texas Instruments chips – which process digital signals – showed they were manufactured more than 30 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For the most part, it’s the same chips that you find in your car or your microwave,” said a Ukrainian weapons expert with access to recovered Russian military gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gehan Amaratunga, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Cambridge, reviewed a list of more than 600 Western components compiled by RUSI and Reuters that were found in Russian weapons and military systems recovered in Ukraine. “They are mostly standard products which are dated and can be found in many industrial electronic systems,” he said. “As such, they are not specialist military specification products.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, he added, “it is the reality that all standard integrated circuits can be used for both civilian and military purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Banner at the top of the website of the Moscow-based computer retailer Kvantech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite what the West has described as an unprecedented series of strict sanctions against Russia, many commodity electronic components still aren’t subject to export controls. And even if they are, there’s a global galaxy of suppliers and traders in East Asia and other countries that are willing to ship them and are often beyond the control of Western manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A review by Reuters of Russian customs records identified more than 15,000 shipments of Western electronic components that reached Russia after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine through the end of May. The manufacturers included AMD, Analog Devices, Infineon, Intel and Texas Instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parts included microprocessors, programmable chips, storage devices and other items, according to the Russian customs data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia itself has made no secret of its desire to continue the flow of imported Western tech products. In June, President Vladimir Putin signed a law to permit Russian companies to import electrical goods and their components without the patent owners’ permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Moscow-based computer retailer, Kvantech, now proclaims at the top of its website in Russian: “Attention! We are working normally. Our warehouses are ready to supply equipment to customers from the Russian Federation despite EU and U.S. sanctions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Commerce declined to comment. The EU didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eXulGwu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A screenshot from the website of Moscow-based computer retailer Kvantech shows Western brands it says it is still selling, even though the firms have stopped doing business in Russia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian website features the logos of more than a half-dozen top U.S. technology companies. Asked how Kvantech manages to continue procuring Western computer equipment, a company official who gave his name only as Viktor said it was “a commercial secret.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reuters obtained the Russian customs records from three commercial providers, including one that had 2022 data. To verify the most recent data, the news agency cross-checked a sample of that provider’s earlier records – including the date, buyer, seller, international product code and other information – with the two other sources and found that they matched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andre Tauber, a spokesman for Infineon, said the German company had launched an internal investigation based on Reuters findings, which identified more than 450 shipments to Russia between Feb. 25 and May 30 of products made by Infineon-owned Cypress Semiconductor. Reuters also found nearly 2,500 shipments of Infineon products that arrived in Russia after the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are in the process of reviewing and verifying the information you provided and will take appropriate actions as needed,” Tauber said. “Infineon takes this matter very seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added that “Infineon instructed all distribution partners globally to prevent deliveries of Infineon products or services contrary to the sanctions and their spirit.” He said, “Compliance with applicable laws is of utmost importance for Infineon, and we have established robust policies and processes to comply with these laws. It proves difficult to control ongoing sales throughout the entire supply chain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for AMD said the firm is investigating Russian customs data shared by Reuters showing that between March 2 and May 31, there were about 200 shipments of AMD components and nearly 700 shipments of Xilinx components to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The information shared is concerning,” a spokesperson said. While the company has “not seen any diversion of AMD products into Russia … AMD takes these matters very seriously and we have commenced a thorough review of the data to identify potential issues.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reuters shared with Analog Devices Russian customs data showing that since the invasion, there have been more than 7,700 shipments to Russia of its components through the end of May. There have also been nearly 900 shipments of parts made by Maxim Integrated, which Analog Devices owns, the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ The on-board computer also contains Cypress Semiconductor chips.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Analog Devices said, “Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and in compliance with U.S. and EU sanctions, Analog Devices ceased business activities in Russia and promptly instructed all of its distributors to halt shipments of our products into Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spokesman added, “We take this seriously and are investigating the veracity of the” Russian customs data “and whether any of our distributors violated our express instructions. Any post-sanctions shipment to Russia would be in direct violation of ADI’s express instructions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Texas Instruments said it had conducted “an in-depth review” and found that 36 shipments by the company and six by one of its authorized distributors that arrived in Russia in late February and early March “were in transit before the invasion began.” Reuters found nearly 1,300 additional shipments of Texas Instruments parts to Russia by third-party sellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We stand behind our earlier statement that we are not selling into Russia … and comply with applicable laws and regulations in the countries where we operate,” the spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about more than 80 shipments of Intel products that arrived in Russia in March, a spokesman for Intel said, “In certain cases, these are internal Intel shipments to our offices in Russia, which supported software development work until our cessation of operations on April 5th.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, more than 1,300 shipments of Intel components and 800 shipments of Altera parts from other companies “in most cases … appear to be shipments from third-party suppliers who may have obtained their inventory from various sources,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Intel has a clear policy that our distributors and customers must comply with all export requirements and local and international laws,” the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;back-doors&quot;&gt;Back doors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia relies on Western technology for some of its weapons systems because it doesn’t produce many of the required electronics parts itself. But Russian defense companies don’t just use any available components. Even the most ordinary chips must pass through a strict bureaucratic procurement process designed to test and certify them and make sure they don’t contain “back doors” that could enable Western spying or sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of foreign-made chips in U.S. military equipment is a top concern in Washington as well, “because there can be vulnerabilities that are manufactured into them,” said Ian Williams, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “The Russians are very aware of this, too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a measure of how seriously Russian authorities view infiltration risks, a Ukrainian expert with access to Russian weapons showed Reuters photographs of three small holographic stickers bearing the sword-and-shield logo of Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB, its main intelligence agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stickers appeared on electronic components recovered from Russian missiles, combat helicopters and fighter aircraft, the expert said. The FSB didn’t respond to a message seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lmVI4uN.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ This photo, provided to Reuters by a Ukrainian weapons expert, shows the signature logo of Russia’s FSB on a component of a Russian missile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent compromised components from making their way into Russian weapons, the Kremlin relies on a scientific institute located near Moscow. Recently renamed the All-Russian Research Institute of Radio Electronics, the body acts as a central certifier of all electronic parts used by the defense industry, including manufacturing, as well as repairs, upgrades and even experiments, said two people familiar with the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The institute’s central role was bolstered last year when Putin issued a decree elevating it to the rank of strategic enterprise. The institute cooperates with a large network of labs and certification centers to fulfill its task of cataloging, testing and validating tens of thousands of components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The master list of authorized domestic and imported electronic components curated by the institute can be accessed online by accredited Russian companies. In addition, research and production companies from Russia’s defense industry can submit lists of electronic parts they wish to use for a new project, and the institute tries to make sure they don’t include any unauthorized components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the institute’s mandates is to encourage Russian manufacturers to use domestically produced electronics, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But an institute document seen by Reuters suggests that many Western components have no Russian equivalents. In 2017, the institute reviewed a proposed helicopter-mounted radio-jamming station – designed to disrupt enemy communications – and determined that of the 921 foreign components the design called for, only 242 could be procured from Russian manufacturers at the time, the document showed. The Kremlin and the institute didn’t respond to messages seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defense-ties&quot;&gt;Defense ties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reuters was unable to trace how specific Western chips found inside Russian weapons in Ukraine got there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a review of the Russian customs records shows that some of the same parts were shipped before the invasion by third-party suppliers to several Russian military companies or to other firms with links to the defense industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the importers named on the customs records as having received some of the same types of Western chips found in Russian weapons are AO VOMZ, AO NPK Uralvagonzavod and AO Radiopriborsnab. According to Russian corporate records, Rostec – a state-owned defense giant – has an indirect ownership stake in all three companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, the U.S. Department of the Treasury called Rostec “the cornerstone of Russia’s defense, industrial, technology, and manufacturing sectors.” It is headed by Sergey Chemezov, a former intelligence officer who once worked with Putin in the KGB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jDAwQ5l.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Russian President Vladimir Putin and Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov are pictured in Moscow in May.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rostec and Chemezov have been targeted with sanctions by Washington, the European Union and other countries. Rostec and Chemezov did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radiopriborsnab describes itself on its website as a supplier of electronic components. According to Russian customs records, it has imported Altera and Xilinx chips, the same kind found in Russian radio and electronic-warfare equipment recovered in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another five Russian importers have participated in tenders to supply Russian weapons manufacturers, according to data from Goszakupki, Russia’s official public procurement platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of those five importers – OOO Trade-Component and AO GK Radiant – were sanctioned last year by the U.S. government, which accused them of trying to procure American components “likely” for use in Russian military programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian importers didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has become adept at converting consumer-grade chips for military use. For example, Western weapons manufacturers often rely on special military-grade versions of chips to ensure they can withstand very high temperatures. Since such chips are subject to export controls and harder to procure, Russian weapons companies have found alternatives, according to one of three Ukrainian weapons experts interviewed by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holding the rugged black metal box containing a missile’s on-board computer, the expert pointed to a heat sink designed to cool the electronic components inside, as well as a thick insulation seal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In Russia, they take the consumer version and put some protection around it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean Russian weaponry is outdated, another Ukrainian expert said, noting that the designs of many Russian weapons feature pioneering concepts. Examining the innards of a Russian cruise missile, he found what he said was true technological prowess: a satellite-navigation antenna engraved on a piece of ceramic the size of a postage stamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is quite something,” the expert said. “A lot of people would be interested in seeing this, even the Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;flexibility&quot;&gt;Flexibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the Western electronics found in Russian weapons, one particular type of integrated circuit stands out, according to Western microelectronics experts: programmable chips, known as Field Programmable Gate Arrays, or FPGAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One FPGA – a shiny black Altera Cyclone II chip – was mounted between the gyroscopes of a navigation system recovered in Ukraine from a Russian precision-artillery rocket known as a 9M544.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programmable chips, which have been available for decades, give electronic-equipment manufacturers enormous flexibility because they quickly can be reprogrammed to perform whatever new task is necessary, said Daniel Nenni, a veteran semiconductor professional and co-author of a book on FPGAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is particularly useful for weapons manufacturers whose products require upgrades and modifications through their typically long life cycles, Nenni said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when many industries are starved for chips because of global supply-chain shortages, another advantage of FPGAs is that they can be recycled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The key about the FPGAs is that you can reuse them,” Nenni said. “You can buy a washing machine, take an FPGA out and put it in a missile. It’s that simple because you can reprogram it to do whatever you want.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>James Byrne, et al.</name></author><summary type="html">An examination of the components and functioning of 27 of Russia’s most modern military systems – including cruise missiles, communications systems and electronic warfare complexes – supports that the degradation in Russian military capability could be made permanent if appropriate policies are implemented.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/tNWSFUb.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/tNWSFUb.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Securing Semicon.

This legacy of innovation largely stands on the foundation of a key component: semiconductor chips, found today in almost all electronic products.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Semiconductors are an integral component of various consumer products across industries, including cars, smartphones, and household appliances. But semiconductors can also be used in dual-use goods — products that have both military and civilian applications — such as air guidance systems for both civilian and military aircraft. The tension between economic gain and security risk inherent within dual-use semiconductor goods is heightened in fields with national security implications, such as supercomputing and artificial intelligence (AI). How the government and private sector manage the global value chains (GVCs) of chips will directly affect U.S. global competitiveness and national security going forward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past two years have underscored the importance of semiconductors to the U.S. economy and its national security interests. Pandemic-induced spikes in consumer demand boosted semiconductor demand by 17 percent between 2019 and 2021. Global sales reached $555.9 billion in 2021, 26.2 percent more than the year before. Although China remains the largest market in the world for semiconductors, sales in the Americas represented the largest region for industry growth in 2021. However, this spike in demand, along with stagnating investment, inadequate input supplies, and logistics breakdowns, has led to an unprecedented shortage of semiconductors that has reverberated throughout the roughly 200 downstream industries that depend on chips. In the automotive industry alone, it was projected that global semiconductor shortages were responsible for $210 billion in lost revenue as of September 2021. Short-term supply chain disruptions for the semiconductor industry are compounded by long-term geopolitical challenges and the need to rethink what constitutes both secure and resilient supply chains. While China is a top customer for the semiconductor industry, the perception of China has shifted in recent years from potential partner to existential threat. This shift has led companies and countries alike to rethink their dependency on China as both partner and customer. In particular, the Biden administration has sought policies that attempt to accelerate progress and prolong the United States’ innovative edge, while simultaneously dampening China’s influence throughout the semiconductor marketplace. Countries around the world have begun thinking about ways to reduce dependencies on China, enhance supply chain resiliency, and keep costs down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, this confluence has manifested in calls for nearshoring and “friend-shoring.” As Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in April 2022 remarks, “friend-shoring means . . . that we have a group of countries that have strong adherence to a set of norms and values about how to operate in the global economy and about how to run the global economic system, and we need to deepen our ties with those partners and to work together to make sure that we can supply our needs of critical materials.” The key difference between onshoring and friend-shoring is that friend-shoring is not restricted to domestic production, but rather seeks to move production to allied partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While moving supply chains away from East Asia could increase security in the long run, an ill-conceived implementation of this friend-shoring strategy could result in price hikes and a stronger China over time. In its 2022 capstone report on supply chains, the Biden administration explicitly stated that “the United States cannot make, mine, or manufacture everything ourselves. We must cooperate with our allies and partners to foster and promote collective supply chain resilience.” Thus emerges the need for the United States to choose its partners wisely when it comes to semiconductor supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the United States considers how to build more secure and resilient supply chains, it should seek closer collaboration with countries demonstrating the following characteristics: (1) the bloc should maintain robust support for technology development, whether through a conducive regulatory environment or significant government investment in research; and (2) as a matter of national security, the United States should enhance cooperation only with those parties whose export controls are consistent with its own, including compliance with the Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is already leveraging relationships with foreign partners to enhance semiconductor supply chain resiliency; increase collaboration on distortive trade practices, investment screening, and export controls; and enhance transatlantic cooperation regarding secure internet and communication technology (ICT) supply chains. In its first year, the Biden administration pursued closer security relationships with both selected Asian countries and the European Union. In May 2022, the United States and the European Union held the second ministerial of the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC). The TTC seeks to promote closer transatlantic collaboration through 10 specific working groups, including rebalancing transatlantic semiconductor supply chains. The joint statement from the second ministerial underscores the need to build more geographically and commercially diversified supply chains and directly highlights an overdependence on China for the production and processing of certain inputs. In the supply chain annex, the parties agreed to develop an early warning and monitoring mechanism on semiconductor value chains, monitor and prepare for supply chain disruptions, and enhance transparency and commit to exchange information to avoid a subsidy race. These types of generalized commitments are relatively easy to put forth, but much more difficult to achieve in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dealing with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also become a major focus of TTC activity, particularly regarding cooperation on sanctions and export controls. The united export control response is intended to cripple Russia’s war machine by cutting the country’s military off from advanced technologies like semiconductors, which are used in military goods like aircraft and tanks. Continued close coordination on sanctions is expected, but whether that will translate into the same level of cooperation outside the Ukraine context remains to be seen. Furthermore, the U.S. focus on export controls in the sector, coupled with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and mounting Chinese pressure on Taiwan, has injected a new level of national security discourse into the trade policy debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to closer collaboration with the European Union, the Biden administration has accelerated its engagement with Asian partners. In September 2021, the United States, Japan, India, and Australia launched a “joint initiative to map capacity, identify vulnerabilities, and bolster supply-chain security for semiconductors and their vital components” as part of their Quad alliance. Quad leaders also convened in May 2022, though the meeting largely centered on security issues. It is unclear how these EU and Quad semiconductor supply chain efforts will progress, but each comes with different economic and national security implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another evolving initiative is the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). All of the Quad countries have indicated their intent to participate in the IPEF, though they have not yet announced which specific pillar negotiations they will join. While details of the framework remain elusive, the IPEF launch in May 2022 confirmed that the framework will consist of four primary policy pillars: (1) trade; (2) supply chain resiliency; (3) infrastructure, clean energy, and decarbonization; and (4) tax and anti-corruption. The United States Department of Commerce will lead supply chain resiliency, infrastructure and decarbonization, and tax and anti-corruption. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) will head the fair and resilient trade component. It is likely that the Commerce Department will leverage the supply chain resiliency pillar to collaborate more closely with Indo-Pacific partners on semiconductor supply chains, including early warning systems for shortages and information sharing on how to avert future supply chain crunches. That Australia and Japan are likely participants in the USTR’s trade pillar provides the United States with a forum for governments to redouble efforts toward strengthening semiconductor GVCs and cooperation, though Indian participation in the trade pillar remains highly unlikely. Export controls will not be one of the topics covered in the IPEF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the evolving security relationship between the United States, the Quad, and the European Union, this paper focuses on both Quad and EU countries and the possibilities for friend-shoring in both. It assesses how the EU and U.S. governments can collaborate to avoid duplicative policies that fail to enhance the overall resiliency of transatlantic semiconductor supply chains. In addition to analyzing opportunities for closer cooperation across governments, this paper also evaluates policies the U.S. government should pursue to support the private sector and ensure the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. semiconductor industry. The paper also looks at another emerging security partnership among the Quad countries to assess their viability in terms of semiconductor friend-shoring. This project looks at the current landscape of semiconductor research and development (R&amp;amp;D), fabrication, and packaging capacity in these case study countries; evaluates export control regimes in each country; and assesses which countries are best positioned to partner with the United States to build more resilient semiconductor supply chains based on economic and national security considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper finds that, given the inherent and increasing complexity of global semiconductor supply chains, self-sufficiency in semiconductor production is probably unattainable and, in any event, would be counterproductive in the short term and would contravene long-term geostrategic interests that depend on continued innovation and competitiveness. China’s persistent pursuit of intellectual property theft and subsidization of domestic production underscores how important it is for the United States to engage more closely with like-minded allies to bolster the security of analog and next-generation chips. What emerges is the need for an affirmative agenda for semiconductor supply chains among allies. Key recommendations emerged from interviews conducted for this research, including the need to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;identify policy goals that would help bolster semiconductor supply chain resiliency;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;promulgate consistent, predictable policies, particularly related to trade;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;avoid blanket export controls that risk dampening investment in allied semiconductor industries; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;consider the creation of a new mini-export control regime that could function similarly to the Wassenaar Arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these key themes, this paper assesses specific case study countries to evaluate how governments can better support the semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;global-semiconductor-value-chain&quot;&gt;Global Semiconductor Value Chain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global semiconductor value chain is dominated by the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Europe, and China. The semiconductor GVC consists of three main stages: R&amp;amp;D (chip design), fabrication (chip production), and advanced testing and packaging (back-end manufacturing). R&amp;amp;D and chip design require substantial funding and human capital input; consequently, the industry has one of the highest R&amp;amp;D margins across all industries. Semiconductor companies spend more than 18 percent of their revenue on R&amp;amp;D. Fabrication (fab) involves the production of chips, a deeply technical and precise six-step process. Front-end manufacturing requires significant capital expenditures. For example, a standard semiconductor fab requires roughly $5 billion of investment, while an advanced fab can cost over $20 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cTSXGPp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Semiconductor Value Chain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fabless foundry model allows firms to specialize in one primary aspect of the semiconductor GVC and to outsource manufacturing. For example, chips might be designed in Silicon Valley, manufactured in East Asia with Dutch machine tools, and then packaged in Malaysia. U.S.-based Qualcomm specializes in the design of semiconductors and does not have production facilities, while companies like Global Foundries specialize in manufacturing and do not do their own design. Meanwhile, companies such as Amkor specialize in assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP), also known as back-end manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YfzLZXL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A large web of global trade flows supports the geographic specialization in the semiconductor value chain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back-end manufacturing is typically handled by outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) companies. Taiwanese companies maintain 53 percent of the back-end market share, though the United States International Trade Commission finds there is a “notable concentration” of ATP service providers in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. In 2019, Taiwan maintained 53 percent of the OSAT market, and a single Taiwanese firm, ASE Group, maintained 26 percent of the global back-end market. The largest OSAT firm in the United States is Amkor Technologies, which accounted for 13 percent of the market in 2019. While ATP services account for only 10 percent of a chip’s value, they are the important last step in the production process. On the other hand, the integrated device model (IDM) represents the vertical integration of semiconductor GVCs. Few firms follow the IDM. However, IDM sales reached $257.4 billion, while fabless chip sales reached $127.9 billion, underscoring the profitability derived from the efficiency of vertical integration models. Examples of these vertically integrated firms include Intel, Samsung, and Texas Instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XkKM9Zb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Technology complexity and need for scale have led to emergence of business models focused on a specific layer of the value chain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;semiconductor-policy-in-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Semiconductor Policy in the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While semiconductor GVCs are distributed around the world, diversification of GVCs helps keep costs down and reduces the likelihood of a major disruption. One month into office (in February 2021), President Biden signed an Executive Order on America’s Supply Chains. The order mandated that relevant agencies undertake a comprehensive review U.S. supply chain security in the following key areas: semiconductor manufacturing and advanced packaging, batteries, critical minerals and materials, and pharmaceuticals. With respect to semiconductors, the 100-Day Review found that while the United States remains a leader in design, lack of production capacity and continued reliance on foreign manufacturers continue to restrain industry growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commerce Department, which oversaw the review of semiconductor supply chains, found in its one-year review that chip shortages were particularly acute in certain types of semiconductors. These include legacy logic chips, such as those used in medical devices and automobiles, analog chips used in power management and image sensors, and optoelectronic chips used in sensors and switches. These categories of chips are relatively large in nanometer size, meaning increasing supply is relatively easier to achieve than with other, more advanced chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A combination of factors in the United States, such as high labor costs and insufficient government-supported R&amp;amp;D, has led to a decrease in the U.S. share of semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, from 37 percent in 1990 to 12 percent in 2019. In light of ongoing disruptions to semiconductor supply chains and a decreasing U.S. market share, the Biden administration has deemed this a national security priority. As directed by the February 2021 executive order, the Commerce Department released its 100-day critical supply chain report the following June, providing a comprehensive overview of risks, vulnerabilities, and opportunities to strengthen and secure U.S. semiconductor supply chains. Also in June 2021, the United States Senate passed the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), followed by the House version — the America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing, Pre-Eminence in Technology, and Economic Strength Act of 2022 (the America COMPETES Act). These bills, currently in conference, both contain the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act (the CHIPS for America Act), which would provide substantial investments to boost domestic semiconductor production — to the tune of over $52 billion. In the backdrop of geostrategic competition with China, the Biden administration’s approach to semiconductor investment represents a desire to scale up U.S. industry and maintain a competitive edge for U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS for America Act would allocate $39 billion to the Commerce Department’s semiconductor incentive program, providing up to $3 billion per firm for the construction of new fabs. It would allocate roughly $11 billion for R&amp;amp;D. Additionally, the act would create a new Multilateral Semiconductors Security Fund to promote the development of a secure semiconductor supply chain. The act would also establish new supply chain programs within the Commerce Department. CSIS outlines additional contours of the CHIPS for America Act in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/blogs/perspectives-innovation/chips-america-act-why-it-necessary-and-what-it-does&quot;&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the act, U.S. government spending on semiconductors would complement existing industry efforts to bolster the resiliency and security of semiconductor supply chains. As of 2020, the United States accounted for the largest portion of the semiconductor market share, at 47 percent, equaling $207.9 billion in sales. Major private players are making sizable investments in the domestic semiconductor industry, including to increase domestic production capacity. In 2022, Intel announced it would invest $20 billion in building two Ohio factories. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) concluded a deal to spend $12 billion in Arizona to develop a new plant. Texas Instruments plans to invest $3.5 billion annually for chip manufacturing in the United States through 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;investment-screening-export-controls-and-trade-initiatives&quot;&gt;INVESTMENT SCREENING, EXPORT CONTROLS, AND TRADE INITIATIVES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade policy is an important part of facilitating the development of a resilient semiconductor industry. Trade policies can be tools that enhance innovation and growth, while at the same time restraining the ability of adversaries to develop cutting-edge technologies. The task for policymakers is to ensure that policies to promote industry growth do not conflict with ones to protect national security. Trade policy can play an important role in helping domestic industry “run faster” against competition, but excessive technology controls in the name of national security can have the unintended effect of denying U.S. high-tech companies the revenue they need to innovate and grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has a robust policy tool kit for building more resilient semiconductor supply chains while advancing national security measures. In 2018, Congress passed legislation that enhanced government capabilities to review both foreign investments and domestic outflows. The Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (ECRA) provides the president with the authority to establish new export controls on “emerging” and “foundational” technology — though ECRA did not explicitly define either of those terms, leading to significant uncertainty throughout the private sector. The designation of semiconductors as foundational could result in wide-ranging license requirements for standard chips used in everyday items. However, the Bureau of Industry and Security recently announced in a proposed rule that it was no longer going to distinguish between emerging and foundational designations. Designating semiconductors as foundational could potentially dampen U.S. private-sector profits, thereby restraining the industry’s ability to invest in next-generation R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Trade policy can play an important role in helping domestic industry “run faster” against competition, but excessive technology controls in the name of national security can have the unintended effect of denying U.S. high-tech companies the revenue they need to innovate and grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another trade tool the United States has implemented administratively is the FDPR. The FDPR is an extraterritorial application of U.S. law that permits the government to curb foreign-produced exports containing U.S. equipment or technology, including design, to those on the Entity List. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Biden administration announced it would apply the rule to Russia. The FDPR imposes new license requirements on exports to Russia and applies a policy of denial to license applications for exports or reexports to Russia or for transfers within the country. Overall, the application of the rule significantly restricts Russia’s ability to acquire critical goods like microelectronics, telecommunications items, and aircraft components. Key to compliance is whether foreign trading partners, such as China, will adhere to secondary sanctions — such as the FDPR — that will affect the production, thereby restricting foreign availability of covered products. The European Union and Japan have adopted restrictive measures similar to those of the United States. South Korea has agreed to comply with Western sanctions but has indicated it will not implement its own. In February 2022, Taiwan announced it would also join Western sanctions, and in April 2022, Taiwan initiated its own export curbs on products to Russia, adding 57 products to a new export control list. Nevertheless, it is uncertain whether other trading partners — namely, China and India — will comply with Western export controls, thereby restricting the outflow of semiconductors made with U.S. inputs or design. Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether Western agreement on Russia sanctions will extend beyond the Ukraine conflict — for example, in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another policy tool that could affect collaboration on semiconductor supply chains between the United States and foreign partners is a new outbound investment-screening tool that has been proposed by Senators Casey (D-PA) and Cornyn (R-TX). The Senators’ bill would establish an interagency process to review outbound investment in areas of “national critical capabilities” to entities “of concern.” A similar proposal exists in the House’s America COMPETES Act as well. Proponents of outbound investment screening argue that the outflow of U.S. investment to China bolsters Chinese critical industries, threatening U.S. national security interests. Although critics of the proposal argue it would duplicate the Department of the Treasury’s remit to screen investments, proponents believe this could be a useful mechanism for ensuring that U.S. funds are not used to enhance technological capabilities of foreign adversaries, including bolstering advanced semiconductor manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade and investment policy affects where firms decide to locate and plays a key role in determining which countries can acquire sensitive technologies, and in turn, which types of sensitive technologies are permitted to leave those countries. For trade policy to succeed in achieving desired geopolitical outcomes, it needs to be based on determined end goals and on a calculation of how best to achieve those goals. Part of this consideration requires governments and firms to take into account foreign availability of equivalent products. If most, but not all, countries converge to reduce the export of sensitive chips to adversaries, it remains likely that the adversarial countries will be able to acquire chips from nonparticipating third countries. It is therefore crucial for the United States to work in concert with like-minded countries as it decides whether to encourage or require restrictions on technologies such as semiconductors. Building secure semiconductor GVCs thus requires multilateral cooperation among governments of foreign semiconductor producers, whether specializing in R&amp;amp;D, production, or back-end packaging. It is also incumbent on companies to be familiar with policy developments in this area and make location and investment decisions consistent with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For trade policy to succeed in achieving desired geopolitical outcomes, it needs to be based on determined end goals and on a calculation of how best to achieve those goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;multilateral-initiatives&quot;&gt;MULTILATERAL INITIATIVES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to U.S. policies that affect the trade and security of semiconductors, there are multilateral trade arrangements that create governance structures for chips and other dual-use goods. The Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies is a multilateral export control regime formally established in the Netherlands in 1996. Currently, 42 states participate in this regime, which aims to promote transparency and responsibility in transfers of arms and dual-use goods and technologies, including semiconductors. All Quad countries are members of the Wassenaar Arrangement. There are significant limitations to the Wassenaar Arrangement — namely, the slow pace of its decisionmaking and its role to advise and notify, rather than constrain, trade. Furthermore, Russia’s membership in the arrangement is a factor that makes it difficult for the framework to function effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With executive branch efforts to build more resilient and secure semiconductor supply chains, along with proposed legislation that would provide historic amounts of semiconductor funding, the U.S. government has made the production of chips a top priority that intersects with both economic and national security strategic objectives. As the United States builds the foundation for the next generation of its technological sovereignty, it is confronted with the inherently global nature of semiconductor GVCs and must reconcile the need to promote U.S. industry while protecting national security interests. R&amp;amp;D often occurs in the United States and in Taiwan, while the Netherlands is a key exporter of the machine tools to produce chips. Packaging, meanwhile, occurs primarily in East Asian countries. Recognizing that total onshoring is neither feasible nor desirable, it is important to evaluate which countries could help the United States build more secure semiconductor supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;semiconductor-policy-in-eu-member-states&quot;&gt;Semiconductor Policy in EU Member States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coinciding with the United States’ review of its critical semiconductor supply chains, the European Union has also had a reckoning with its own dependency on foreign producers in critical areas and has reassessed how to enhance its technological sovereignty. In 1990, Europe produced nearly 35 percent of semiconductors globally, but that number has dropped to roughly 9 percent as of 2020. In general, the European Union lags in the final step of the semiconductor value chain — back-end manufacturing — which involves the assembly, testing, and packaging of chips. Globally, only 5 percent of that capability is located in Europe. Even if an increased number of semiconductor wafers are made in Europe, they would still be sent elsewhere, such as China, for packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2021, the European Union announced a legislative package parallel to that of the United States — the European Chips Act — which it formally introduced in February 2022. The European Chips Act intends to reinforce European commitment to significant investments in semiconductors through R&amp;amp;D, fabrication, production, and support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The act consists of three main policy pillars: (1) the “Chips for Europe Initiative,” which supports capacity building through increased investment; (2) “security of supply” through the creation of first-of-a-kind advanced facilities; and (3) preparedness and monitoring to avert supply chain crunches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The act will also work to build stronger supply chains with the United States and with Japan. Given the semiconductor shortage of the past two years, the European Commission intends to strengthen European R&amp;amp;D leadership, improve upon its capacity to innovate in design and manufacturing, and significantly increase its production capacity by 2030. The act also bolsters the Alliance on Processors and Semiconductor Technologies, which seeks to identify gaps in microchip production by reinforcing the European electronics design ecosystem and increasing manufacturing capacity, including testing and advanced packaging. These efforts complement the European Union’s Digital Decade strategy, which establishes an agenda for European digital transformation by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European investment in semiconductor production has raised questions about subsidies — known as “state aid” in the European Union — particularly related to Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEIs). IPCEIs are cross-border initiatives led by member states that can contribute to EU strategies. Since this constitutes state aid, these initiatives must seek approval from the commission. In November 2021, the European Commission adopted revised state aid rules for these projects, which establish criteria for the commission to assess “member state support to cross-border IPCEIs that overcome market failures and enable breakthrough innovation in key sectors and technologies and infrastructure investments, with positive spillover effects for the EU economy at large.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These revised guidelines state that IPCEIs must meet the following criteria: (1) involve at least four member states, (2) be designed in a transparent and inclusive manner, (3) facilitate SME participation, and (4) align their objectives with current EU priorities, such as the green transition. The guidelines also include safeguards to ensure that the aid is proportional and prevents any undue market distortions. These subsidies would generally fall under the ambit of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures under World Trade Organization rules. If the effects of such subsidies are determined to be injurious, they can be countervailed by other countries, which could have the net effect of restricting semiconductor trade and driving up costs. There are six requirements for IPCEIs and none of the requirements prohibit the inclusion of non-European companies in such projects. Thus, nominally, a U.S. company could benefit from IPCEI funds. Only four IPCEIs have ever been notified and assessed by the commission. Two were infrastructure projects that did not include non-European companies. The other two IPCEIs involved strategic value chains and did include non-European companies. Murata (in Japan) and Cortec (in the United States) took part in the microelectronic IPCEI, and Endurance Technologies (in India) participated in the battery IPCEI. However, the vast majority of companies that participated in these two IPCEIs were still European.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the existence of IPCEIs presents companies with added benefits when partnering with the European Union on semiconductor supply chains. First, IPCEIs offer additional funding revenues. Second, they leverage the European Union’s integrated single market, which makes it relatively easier to build a semiconductor ecosystem, with parts of the supply chain split among countries to leverage the capabilities of specific member states. Although IPCEIs are projects led and funded by the government, multinational private firms are not restricted from obtaining that funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next section of this paper evaluates which EU member states are best positioned for increased semiconductor collaboration with the United States. While some degree of redundancy in semiconductor supply chains can help increase overall resiliency, the transatlantic alliance should attempt to avoid duplicative spending on chips where possible. The member states assessed below possess existing semiconductor infrastructure and are poised to expand domestic capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While some degree of redundancy in semiconductor supply chains can help increase overall resiliency, the transatlantic alliance should attempt to avoid duplicative spending on chips where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;belgium&quot;&gt;BELGIUM&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belgium’s central location between Europe’s major economic powers makes it a natural crossroads for the semiconductor industry and European diplomacy. Most economic activity is concentrated in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking northern region of Belgium, where many Belgian high-technology and services firms are based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&amp;amp;D Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Belgium is a top player in the global semiconductor R&amp;amp;D supply chain. Belgium ranks fifth on the European Innovation Scoreboard. Flanders is home to five research universities and four strategic research centers. Specific to semiconductor R&amp;amp;D, Belgium had the fifth-highest accumulated number of paper contributions to semiconductor research between 1995 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crown jewel of Belgium’s semiconductor R&amp;amp;D industry is the Interuniversity Microelectronics Center (Imec) in Leuven, one of the world’s top semiconductor R&amp;amp;D institutes. Imec boasts 12,000 square meters of cleanroom and lab capacity and a workforce of over 5,000 researchers from 95 countries across its facilities. Imec’s $3 billion experimental pilot line is one of its top attractions, allowing researchers to develop limited quantities of leading-edge chips two or three generations ahead of current leading-edge manufacturing with a new 2D graphene-based process. Imec often refers to itself as “the Switzerland of semiconductors” to highlight its corporate and geopolitical neutrality. Although the Belgian government funds 16 percent of its $773 million budget, no single firm or state has a controlling stake. As a result, Imec holds a unique place as a convener in the global semiconductor industry and a nexus of basic and applied research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has taken note of Imec’s industry centrality, noting its geopolitical importance in its supply chain 100-day review. Under the European Chips Act, Imec would receive over €1 billion ($1.1 billion) in public funding to create new test line facilities to speed the transition from the R&amp;amp;D of leading-edge chip technology to its commercialization. The United States Department of Commerce and the National Institute of Standards and Technology have also identified Imec as a potential partner for overlapping with or complementing U.S. efforts to build a stronger domestic semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fab Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Belgium is home to only one fab, U.S.-based Onsemi’s Oudenaarde manufacturing facility. The 40,000 square foot fab produces six-inch wafers at the 350–2000nm level for mostly automotive and industrial application, but no leading-edge chips. In February 2022, Belgian firm BelGaN Group BV acquired the Oudenaarde manufacturing facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits and Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; Belgium’s central location and role in the European Union, along with its robust R&amp;amp;D ecosystem and transportation linkages to major European markets, make the country an attractive location for semiconductor investment. However, the United States International Trade Administration warns that Belgium’s shortage of STEM labor limits the country’s R&amp;amp;D and high-tech manufacturing potential. Compared to other case study countries in this report, Belgium has the lowest percentage of tertiary graduates from STEM programs, roughly equal to only 17 percent of total graduates, according to data from the European Commission. In Belgium, 72 percent of young adults enroll in a bachelor’s program or equivalent by the age of 25, the highest rate among member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Nevertheless, only 0.8 percent of working-age Belgians have a doctoral degree, which ranks below the OECD average. While Belgium’s streamlined policies for high-skill immigration partially offset this relative shortcoming, the country’s more limited number of STEM graduates is a factor that could affect its ability to compete against other countries with a larger talent pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-netherlands&quot;&gt;THE NETHERLANDS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands is a semiconductor powerhouse, one of the few countries in the world with a fully integrated vertical semiconductor supply chain. This includes applied research, chip design, chip architecture, chip production, and system integration and applications. The Dutch have also effectively dominated the machine tool portion of the semiconductor supply chain in Europe. Businesses in the Netherlands generate the highest average sales in the semiconductor industry, accounting for €4.4 billion ($4.8 billion) annually. The four companies that predominantly make up the industry are ASM International, ASML, BE Semiconductor Industries (Besi), and NXP Semiconductors (NXP). The Netherlands is also home to several companies that provide equipment to the semiconductor manufacturing industry. For instance, ASML is the largest supplier of photolithography systems for the semiconductor industry worldwide and is also involved in the production of 5 nm chip technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&amp;amp;D Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; ASML is the world’s largest supplier of lithography equipment, which is integral in transferring circuit patterns onto wafers. ASML’s sales reached $6.5 billion in 2020, and it is the sole supplier of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which it unveiled in 2019. EUV machines use extreme ultraviolet wavelengths to print the most intricate layers of chips, creating advanced and highly complex semiconductors to achieve “big things on a tiny scale.” ASML’s control of EUV has led some competitors to claim that ASML maintains monopolistic control over the lithography industry. While ASML largely controls the lithography machine side of the supply chain, Intel, Samsung, and TSMC also produce high-grade chips. ASML’s position as the sole provider of EUV machines makes them an ideal partner for companies like Intel and TSMC. In a 2012 deal, Intel acquired a 15 percent ownership stake in ASML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fab Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; The Netherlands is also home to ASM International (ASMi), which was founded in 1968. ASM pioneered technologies such as lithography, deposition, ion implant and single-wafer epitaxy. ASMi also holds a 25 percent stake in ASM Pacific Technology (ASMPT), which was founded in Hong Kong in 1975 and, at the time, was the most productive vertical furnace in the semiconductor industry. Vertical furnaces are key to productivity because they allow a stack of wafers to be loaded into a furnace for simultaneous processing. ASMi’s subsidiary, ASMPT, focuses mostly on assembly and packaging. ASMi was involved throughout the chip-making process, from unprocessed silicon wafers to packaged chips. Recently, they have made breakthroughs in atomic layer deposition and plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition, developing the concept from R&amp;amp;D through production. Their primary focus today is on front-end wafer processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, another prominent Dutch semiconductor company, is engaged in the development, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and service of semiconductor assembly equipment. It operates seven facilities in Asia and Europe for production and development. Besi is involved in the development and supply of die attach equipment, packaging equipment, plating equipment, and service equipment. R&amp;amp;D is spread across Europe, North America, and Asia, while manufacturing occurs largely in Singapore, South Korea, and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits and Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; The Netherlands is an attractive partner for closer U.S. collaboration for several reasons. In the 2021 International Institute for Management Development (IMD) World Competitiveness Ranking, the Netherlands ranked fourth overall, surpassed by Switzerland, Sweden, and Denmark. The Netherlands placed second for overall economic performance, fourth for business efficiency, and seventh for infrastructure. The country also scored well on international trade, international investment, and technology infrastructure. The most recent edition of the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index, in 2019, also ranked the Netherlands as the most competitive country in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands also excels in education. Dutch expenditures on higher education are 30 percent higher than the OECD average and its expenditures on R&amp;amp;D are the sixth highest in the OECD. Furthermore, the Netherlands has a comparatively internationalized higher education system, meaning it succeeds in attracting foreign talent to complement its domestic workforce. Among doctoral students, 43 percent are international, the majority of which come from other European countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other attractive features of the Netherlands are its geographic location and its top-tier infrastructure. Its location affords the country easy access to other European capitals and to an extensive international trade network that facilitates cross-channel flows to the United Kingdom and transatlantic flows to its North American partners. The Port of Rotterdam, Europe’s largest port, is a key facilitator of the country’s robust international trade profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands has also recently acquiesced to U.S. demands for cooperation on export control issues. In 2018, the Dutch government provided ASML with an export license to send advanced lithography equipment to China, thereby enabling China to produce its own chips. The Trump administration, fearful about Chinese acquisition of these advanced machine tools, sought to outright ban the transfer of lithography equipment from the Netherlands to China. Pressure from the Trump administration ultimately prevailed, and the Netherlands reversed the license. While transatlantic cooperation ultimately prevailed in this case, Dutch cooperation on export controls was reluctant and only followed significant pressure from the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NXP, in particular, has had to placate both U.S. and Chinese regulatory authorities in recent years. In 2015, the United States Federal Trade Commission required that NXP divest its radio-frequency power amplifier before it approved NXP’s acquisition of Freescale, a U.S. semiconductor company. NXP acquiesced and sold the unit to a Chinese state-owned investment management firm. After the merger with Freescale, NXP further divested and sold its standard products business to the same Chinese firm in 2016. Finally, in 2018, Qualcomm attempted to acquire NXP, and NXP sold its stake in a Chinese chip-design joint venture in an attempt to appease Chinese regulatory authorities, who ultimately failed to approve the Qualcomm-NXP merger. These actions suggest that NXP and the Dutch have worked to placate Chinese authorities and have sought to play the middle ground in order to maintain access to both the Chinese and U.S. markets. Overall, the ASML and NXP cases underscore that the Netherlands will continue to contend with not only political pressure from the U.S. government, but also the continued attractiveness of the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Netherlands and the European Union have demonstrated a willingness to comply with the extraterritorial application of U.S. export controls, the case with ASML demonstrates the importance of allied collaboration regarding long-term geopolitical goals, since restricting which countries can access advanced manufacturing tools can help or hinder their bid for technological superiority. Overall, given the Netherlands’ abundance of water, highly trained workforce, and closer cooperation with the U.S. government on export controls, it continues to remain one of the best options for U.S. foreign collaboration on semiconductor GVCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;france&quot;&gt;FRANCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France is the second-largest economy in the European Union and maintains a significant presence in the European semiconductor industry, with centers for R&amp;amp;D, manufacturing, and packaging. In 2019, France exported €1.05 billion ($1.15 billion) in semiconductor devices, primarily to Singapore, Germany, China, and the Netherlands. The French semiconductor industry will receive not only support from the EU initiatives on semiconductors, but also funding from the France 2030 initiative. As part of the €30 billion ($30.7 billion) France 2030 investment initiative, France is committing nearly €6 billion ($6.5 billion) to the semiconductor industry, focusing primarily on the physical and electronics components to double the country’s electronics production by 2030. This investment will go toward the creation of smaller chips, with the goal of reasserting France as a “leader in the field.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&amp;amp;D Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; CEA-Leti is a government research center based in Grenoble and a major player in the international nanoelectronics sector. It has partnerships with various companies such as III-V Lab, Intel, Mapper, Soitec, and STMicroelectronics (ST) on a range of issues regarding the development and research of semiconductor technologies. The first-stage resources from the European Chips Act will go to major European research institutions. ST has an office in Tours that also works on R&amp;amp;D, engineering, processes, applications, and other business operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fab Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; STMicroelectronics is the preeminent semiconductor vendor in France. The company operates two wafer fabs and the largest R&amp;amp;D center and produces up to 16 nm chips, providing notable production capacity. Its location in Grenoble has over 10,000 staff, and a manufacturing facility for automotive-grade chips in Rousset has over 4,000 staff. The company has a strong presence in automotive integrated circuits. ST is a key supplier to the German automotive industry. Besides fab capacity, France does have some back-end manufacturing capabilities. In 2017, UnitySC opened its operations in Grenoble, where it has approximately 10,000 square feet in cleanroom space and carries out its packaging operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits and Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; France benefits from robust macroeconomic stability and a well-developed financial system. Moreover, it is regarded as a prominent innovation hub. The 2021 IMD World Competitiveness Ranking places it at 29th overall; it is surpassed by its neighbors, the Netherlands and Germany. Regardless, it is the seventh-largest economy in the world in terms of GDP and eighth in total exports. France boasts the highest rate of public support for R&amp;amp;D among OECD countries. It is the top destination for international investment in Europe. Its well-educated population and renowned universities help generate a talented, well-equipped workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainland France is close to the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany. With its well-established infrastructure links, it is a key player in continental trade. Paris’s Charles de Gaulle Airport processes the second-highest amount of airfreight in Europe, second only to the Frankfurt Airport. France is one of Europe’s only silicon metal producers. Its overseas territories, stretching from French Polynesia to French Guiana, hold substantial amounts of mineral wealth. France stands to benefit from bauxite refining in French Guiana, which is crucial to extracting gallium. In addition, yet-untapped mineral reserves on the ocean floor of its maritime possessions in the Indo-Pacific would allow France to present itself as an alternative to China in supplying rare-earth minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While France, along with Belgium and Germany, already has robust R&amp;amp;D infrastructure for next-generation semiconductors, it is creating plans to accelerate production. However, the United States Department of Commerce notes that France’s regulations and government bureaucracy can sometimes restrain the French market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;italy&quot;&gt;ITALY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy has the third-largest economy in the European Union, with several large manufacturing sites for a diverse set of semiconductor components. In Italy, the automotive industry accounts for 6 percent of the GDP and employs 300,000 people, meaning the effects of semiconductor supply chain crunches are particularly pronounced for the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&amp;amp;D Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; In June 2021, STMicroelectronics (ST) announced an agreement with the technological university, Politecnico di Milano, to create a research center on advanced materials for sensors. ST hopes to enable researchers and university faculty to collaborate on microelectromechanical systems technology and attract new academic talent. The company signed an agreement with the University of Catania in late 2021 to create a framework for enhanced education and research activities in power electronics. Italy is also the headquarters of Technoprobe, which has three research centers and 2,200 employees worldwide. Technoprobe specializes in testing solutions for chips, as well as the design, development, and production of probe cards. These allow for the testing of chips before they are individually packaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fab Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Italy is the second home of multinational STMicroelectronics, which has over 9,000 employees in the country. ST focuses on sensory and power technologies, automotive products, embedded processing solutions, and a broad range of segments. In reaction to high demand, ST plans to double its investments in 2022 to up to $3.6 billion. In Milan, ST has facilities with several fabrication lines, including a 300 mm fab. The company’s Catania in Sicily site hosts two 200 mm fabrication facilities. In March 2022, the European Investment Bank announced it would provide ST a loan of €600 million ($628.7 million), which the firm will use for R&amp;amp;D and pilot production lines for advanced semiconductors. ST will use this investment primarily at two existing facilities in Italy and one in France. Following the announcement of this funding, French minister for the Economy, Finance, and Recovery Bruno Le Maire underscored that the primary goal of the funding is to accelerate French and Italian production of semiconductors, adding that “it is only by mastering this technology, that we will be able to safeguard the European Union’s strategic independence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another significant player in the Italian semiconductor industry is Lfoundry, which runs an advanced 200 mm manufacturing fabrication site and proprietary technologies at 150 nm and 110 nm nodes. Lfoundry provides complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors, or CIS, through CIS processes to 90 nm and backside illumination technology. In 2016, Lfoundry was acquired by Chinese Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation. PVA Italy is also a player, specializing in wafer plasma treatment systems and in crystal production plants for the photovoltaic industry and the semiconductor industry. NXP Italy in Milan manufactures devices for the automotive, industrial, and consumer and transaction/access segments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel has been planning to expand into Italy with a facility for assembly, testing, and packaging, which would complement Intel investments in France and Germany. The Italian government has encouraged Intel to invest in the country. Turin and Catania are potential sites that Intel has considered for expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits and Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; In some ways, Italy may not be an ideal partner for closer engagement on semiconductors with the United States. Among the identified potential European partners, Italy ranked last in both economic performance and government efficiency according to the 2021 IMD World Competitiveness Ranking, as well as in the World Economic Forum’s competitiveness ranking. As a percentage of GDP, Italy also spends less on R&amp;amp;D than Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and France. Additionally, Italy has a less educated workforce than most of the European Union, with the second-lowest percentage of a tertiary-educated population among EU countries. Italy’s political system is also relatively unstable compared to other western European nations, with coalition governments that are often short-lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Mario Draghi has taken steps to protect Italy’s domestic semiconductor industry from Chinese competition. In April 2021, Draghi blocked a Chinese company from taking over an Italian semiconductor firm. This decision blocked Chinese company Shenzhen Investment Holdings from acquiring a 70 percent stake in Milan-based LPE. LPE produces components for power electronics applications. Draghi cited the ongoing semiconductor shortage as leading to slowdowns in the Italian automotive sector and said that semiconductors had thus become “a strategic sector” for the country. An actual or attempted Chinese acquisition of domestic industries is not inherently problematic, but the decision to allow a foreign takeover of a domestic business that is deemed to have strategic importance from both an economic and security perspective can change a government’s calculation of risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy also has a complicated relationship with China, which affects its reliability as a partner in this strategic space. In 2019, Italy signed a memorandum of understanding supporting China’s Belt and Road Initiative, against the warnings of European and U.S. leaders. Since the Draghi government took over in 2021, Italy has begun to reverse course and has reemphasized transatlantic relations while distancing itself from China. The Draghi government has vetoed bids by Chinese companies to acquire Italian firms on three different occasions, including once in the semiconductor industry as discussed above. Nonetheless, the back-and-forth nature of Italy’s relationship with China causes concern when identifying potential long-term strategic partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are benefits to partnering with Italy. A major benefit to closer collaboration with the country is the recent Intel investment. As mentioned above, the project intends primarily to build a large, state-of-the-art packaging facility, which has historically been the weak point in the European semiconductor supply chain. Thus, Italy may have to be included in any strategic planning out of necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Draghi has been behind new momentum in Italy for European semiconductor production, saying in October 2021 that “governments need to fully commit to a European Union plan to increase the bloc’s share of global semiconductor production to 20 percent by 2030.” In March 2022, Draghi announced that Italy would spend €4 billion ($4.4 billion) to develop its domestic semiconductor industry. The Italian government has approved a new fund to allocate €150 million ($157.1 million) in 2022 and €500 million ($523.7 million) annually until 2030. The government is also in talks with Intel to nearshore part of its semiconductor supply chain to the country. It is estimated that Italian incentives for Intel, including favorable terms and public financing, will be worth €8 billion ($9 billion) over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;germany&quot;&gt;GERMANY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Germany exported $6.5 billion in semiconductor devices, making it the fourth-largest exporter in the world. On the other hand, Germany is also the fourth-largest importer of semiconductor devices. Imports of semiconductors reached €5.7 billion ($6.3 billion) in 2019. In total, Germany accounts for €10.8 billion ($11.8 billion) of Europe’s €33 billion ($36 billion) semiconductor market. Germany is key to semiconductor production due to its production of gases, specialty chemicals, and other consumables that play direct roles in fabrication and facility-cleaning materials. For example, Merck KGaA in Darmstadt produces specialty gases that are critical to chip production. Germany, like the rest of Europe, is challenged by the final step of the semiconductor value chain, back-end manufacturing. Germany’s use of semiconductors is concentrated in consumer goods, such as automobiles and other high-end manufactured household goods. These include digital devices like cameras and household appliances such as dishwashers, which use standard rather than cutting-edge chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&amp;amp;D Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Intel has recently agreed to invest nearly €80 billion ($88 billion) in semiconductor production in the European Union, of which €17 billion ($18.6 billion) is slated for Germany, where the company plans to build a “leading-edge semiconductor fab mega-site.” Companies such as Infineon, Carl Zeiss, and Zollner all have R&amp;amp;D operations in Germany. In 2020, Carl Zeiss employed approximately 1,300 people in R&amp;amp;D roles across Germany. The Fraunhofer Group for Microelectronics and the Leibniz Association are major players in international microelectronic R&amp;amp;D. Between the two groups, they have the largest cooperation for microelectronic R&amp;amp;D in Europe, over 2,000 research staff, and 12,000 square meters of cleanroom space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fab Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Bosch has also been a major manufacturer of German semiconductor chips, including application-specific integrated circuits and power conductors. In December 2021, Bosch started large-scale production of silicon carbide semiconductors in its Reutlingen factory, where Bosch will manufacture the chips on 200 mm wafers to achieve “important economies of scale.” This facility will enable Bosch to meet growing demand for chips used in both internet of things (IoT) and mobility applications. This new factory follows Bosch’s 2021 expansion in Dresden. The semiconductor facility in Dresden is Bosch’s first aIoT (AI with the internet of things), providing specialized chips for the automotive sector. Despite the expansion in semiconductor building capacity, it will likely not be sufficient to address supply chain issues in Europe, particularly amid sustained demand. Infineon is by far the largest semiconductor company in Germany. Originally part of Siemens, it spun off in 1999 and is now an independent company with revenues of over €11 billion ($13.2 billion) in 2021. Lantiq, a spin-off from Infineon Technologies, was a key supplier of broadband access and home networks technology, but it was acquired by Intel in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits and Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; Germany is an attractive partner for U.S. collaboration given its robust economy and stable political position in the European Union. Germany is the fourth-largest economy in the world and accounted for nearly a quarter of the EU GDP in 2020. Furthermore, Germany is an important global exporter, the third-largest after China and the United States. The United States imports many German goods and Germany is the United States’ largest European trading partner. Germany is also the sixth-largest market for U.S. exports. According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index, in 2019, Germany ranked seventh in global competitiveness. Germany is advanced in research and innovation and has a pro-business climate. Germany has many established supply chain linkages and the policy to enforce due diligence. Furthermore, Germany has a strong industrial base, including its global leadership in the automotive industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany maintains a stable domestic government and historically has been one of the most politically influential countries in the European Union. The previous chancellor, Angela Merkel, established a leading role in the European Union for many years, but it is yet to be seen if the new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will take on a similar role. Although it remains unclear as to what extent the new chancellor will continue Merkel’s foreign policy approach to China or whether he will join Brussels in taking a harder line against Beijing, Germany’s stable government makes it an attractive partner for continued U.S. partnership on semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany is aiming to phase out coal and nuclear energy in favor of renewable sources. While this energy transition is desirable for the future, it could cause an increase in energy prices in the short term, affecting economic competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microelectronics was deemed an IPCEI by Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The article allowed five EU member states, including Germany, to allocate state aid to projects in microelectronics. This provided Germany with €1 billion ($1.01 billion) in funding for microelectronic industries. In December 2021, Germany formally notified the European Commission of a new IPCEI through which Germany will support transnational cooperation on microelectronics, such as semiconductors. With the new IPCEI for Microelectronics and Communication Technologies underway, Germany will benefit from €4.5 billion ($4.9 billion) in state aid and total investments of €15 billion ($16.5 billion). This is in addition to forthcoming funds from the European Chips Act, which will further enhance member state production capabilities. Other initiatives include Germany’s Microelectronics Framework Program, launched by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research last year, which emphasizes the importance of trustworthiness and sustainability in the supply chain. In addition, the EUREKA Clusters Program supports important research, development, and innovation topics with national authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-european-union&quot;&gt;THE EUROPEAN UNION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the European Union is an attractive partner for closer collaboration with the United States on securing semiconductor GVCs. A particularly appealing and unique factor to investing in the European Union is its single market, which facilitates the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people. This makes it relatively easy for companies to invest across member states and to capitalize on local incentives and favorable business conditions. That Intel has deployed investments in France for R&amp;amp;D, Germany for production, and Italy for back-end manufacturing underscores the appeal of cooperating with the bloc on semiconductor GVCs. Furthermore, funding made available through both Brussels and member state governments helps increase the cohesion and resilience of semiconductor GVCs throughout the bloc. Other benefits the European Union offers in terms of supply chain resilience include geographic proximity to the United States and an existing close security relationship, including deepening cooperation on trade policies such as export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to transatlantic cooperation regarding China — a strategic adversary to both parties, as well as a large and consistent customer — the relationship becomes more complicated. Overall, the European Union has taken a more moderate approach to China, seeking to increase market access for EU firms, while simultaneously adopting new trade defense and investment-screening tools, such as the EU anti-coercion instrument, intended to stem Chinese influence throughout Europe. Large European economies have an interest in maintaining positive relationships with Beijing due to its large consumer base, which maintains high demand for Germany’s automobile industry, for example. In 2020, one in three German cars were sold in China. It remains to be seen whether China will continue to comply with international sanctions against Russia or whether a decision not to comply would force Brussels closer to Washington, D.C., in its approach to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the United States, the European Union has recently made significant changes to its export control and foreign investment policy. In September 2021, the European Union announced its new Export Control Regulation, which tightens control of dual-use items, strengthens critical supply chains, and protects human rights. It also seeks to enhance cohesion among member states regarding export control policy, including by providing capacity-building and training services for licensing and enforcement programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the Wassenaar Arrangement, the TTC has bolstered EU-U.S. collaboration on export controls following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The TTC has provided diplomats with clear communication channels through which to consult on urgent trade and security matters, including semiconductor supply chains. In the European Union, export controls have historically been a competency of member states, which vary by country. For example, Belgium delegates export licensing responsibility to its three regional states, adding complexity to an export control regime closely intertwined with — though distinct from — the European Commission. The joint statement released following the May 2022 ministerial lays out the transatlantic plan to cooperate more closely on semiconductor R&amp;amp;D, including increasing transparency on subsidies and developing an early warning system for semiconductor supply chain disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Group of Seven (G7), currently under German leadership, has also proven adroit at navigating security and supply chain issues. The G7 responded swiftly to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, revoking Russia’s most favored nation status and initiating sweeping sanctions on key Russian officials and business elites. Given the near impossibility of expelling Russia from the Wassenaar Arrangement and the improbability of Russia removing itself, multilateral cooperation on export controls is likely to occur through other frameworks, such as the G7, the TTC, and smaller plurilateral agreements. There is growing discussion about the need to capitalize on current momentum behind the international response to Russia by creating a new plurilateral arrangement for advanced technologies among allied countries. Possible participants include specific EU member states (such as France, Germany, and the Netherlands), Japan, South Korea, and potentially Taiwan. Such an architecture could either complement the Wassenaar Arrangement or potentially replace it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quad-cooperation&quot;&gt;Quad Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;india&quot;&gt;INDIA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India, slated to become the world’s most populous nation, is a major growth market for the semiconductor industry. In 2020, semiconductor consumption in India was worth 1.1 trillion rupees ($13.87 billion), significantly less than the €44 billion ($47.8 billion) consumed in Europe in 2020. However, consumption of semiconductors in India is expected to grow to $80–90 billion by 2030. Despite a large population and growing manufacturing base, India imports nearly 100 percent of its commercial semiconductor products. Most large multinational semiconductor companies such as Intel, Samsung, TSMC, NXP, Broadcom, and Micron have offices in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&amp;amp;D Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; India has thus far specialized in the R&amp;amp;D and design phases of the semiconductor supply chain. A deep bench of highly skilled information technology and engineering workers, coupled with world-renowned public institutes of technology, enables India to specialize in R&amp;amp;D. This has led to several important public and private semiconductor R&amp;amp;D facilities in India. Since 2006, the Indian government has supported two Centers of Excellence in Nanoelectronics (CENs) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore and at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) in Mumbai. IISc’s CEN hosts over 150 researchers across 14,000 square feet of cleanroom space, with the capacity to conduct leading-edge R&amp;amp;D at the 10 nm level. IITB’s CEN hosts a nanofabrication facility that has limited fab capabilities for two-inch, four-inch, and eight-inch silicon wafers, though only for R&amp;amp;D purposes. In the private sector, several major semiconductor companies, such as Micron, Intel, Samsung, Texas Instruments, and Huawei, have R&amp;amp;D facilities in Bangalore, “India’s Silicon Valley.” For both Intel and Samsung, their facilities in Bangalore represent their largest R&amp;amp;D operations outside of their home countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, over 500,000 Indian engineers are involved in designing 2,000 chips each year. This is the largest number of leading-edge chip designers outside of the United States. In India, most design output comes from very large-scale integration and electronic design automation (EDA). However, the United States continues to dominate by far in EDA scale and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fab Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite its relatively strong R&amp;amp;D capabilities, India lags in semiconductor fabrication. India attempted to incentivize private fab construction in the late 2000s and 2010s, but it currently has only two fabs: the Society for Integrated Circuit Technology and Applied Research (SITAR) in Bengaluru and the Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL) outside of Chandigarh. SITAR can produce six-inch wafers, but not advanced nodes. SCL can fabricate 180 nm six-inch and eight-inch wafers. However, both facilities are government-run and primarily produce semiconductor products for defense and space uses, not for the Indian commercial market, though they do have onsite packaging and testing capacity. As a result, India produces no legacy or next-generation chips for export or domestic consumption, instead relying on imports of many of the products it researches and designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits and Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; The Indian government has taken several initiatives since December 2021 under its Semicon India Program, with an outlay of $10 billion to increase production of semiconductors. These include (a) a scheme for setting up semiconductor fabs, with financial support subject to fulfillment of certain conditions, infrastructure support, and a designation of a nodal agency for faster regulatory approvals; (b) a scheme for setting up display fabs, with similar fiscal and infrastructure support, and establishment of the nodal agency; (c) a scheme for setting up compound semiconductors and semiconductor assembly, testing, marking, and packaging, with a percentage of capital expenditure fiscally supported by the government on fulfillment of relevant criteria; and (d) the Design Linked Incentive Scheme composed of chip design infrastructure support, product design linked incentive, and deployment linked incentive. Through these incentives, the government is also looking to increase foreign investment in the sector. In February 2022, the government confirmed that it received applications from three companies for semiconductor fabs, two companies for display fabs, four companies for compound semiconductors and assembly, and three companies for design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, systemic issues continue to restrain enthusiasm for closer collaboration with India. Ongoing water shortages, power outages, and transportation disincentivize new investment, particularly the construction of new production facilities. Furthermore, India has historically been reluctant to join the Western sanctions and export control regimes, aside from the Wassenaar Arrangement. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, India opted against joining the Western sanctions effort and abstained from a vote at the United Nations to condemn Russia’s invasion, making India an outlier among the major powers. India’s decision to maintain a middle line in global relations with China and Russia dilutes its attractiveness as a trusted partner for friend-shoring secure semiconductor supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japan&quot;&gt;JAPAN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is the world’s fourth-largest market for semiconductor manufacturing and equipment sales. The United States Department of Commerce estimates that Japan’s semiconductor industry will grow to over $47 billion in 2022 after having grown more than 19 percent in 2021. In terms of global monthly wafer capacity, Japan accounts for roughly 15.8 percent of global supply. The effects of the ongoing semiconductor shortage have been particularly acute in Japan’s automobile sector. In October 2021, for example, domestic automobile sales declined 31.3 percent due to the chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Japan still has the most semiconductor factories in the world, these factories largely lag behind other more high-tech factories abroad and, thus, do not produce the type of cutting-edge semiconductor chips that are needed around the world. Japan’s strength lies in its deep industrial expertise in semiconductor materials. For instance, in 2019, Sony semiconductors became a top global supplier through the production of camera image sensors. Other examples include Lasertech Corp., the world’s sole manufacturer of equipment that tests stencils for the most advanced chip designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Japan specializes in power semiconductors and NAND flash memory chips, it lags behind other Asian competitors — namely, South Korea and Taiwan — when it comes to the manufacture of next-generation, highly specialized chips. Furthermore, despite being home to 84 chip factories, Japan imports 64 percent of its chips, making it reliant on foreign producers and vulnerable to semiconductor supply chain disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason for this reliance is Japan’s failure to embrace a horizontal production model of chips that gained favor in the early 2000s. The Japanese model instead focused on vertical integration, whereby companies like Toshiba, Fujitsu, and Hitachi produced chips solely for their own products. This model ultimately lost out to companies like TSMC, which focuses on producing chips for a wide range of uses and companies. Other reasons for the decline in Japanese chip making include the industry’s delay in embracing digitalization and a lack of public investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&amp;amp;D Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Although Japanese R&amp;amp;D expenditure remains relatively high at roughly 3 percent of the GDP, it continues to lag behind competitors when it comes to industrial innovation. In May 2021, TSMC announced it would open an R&amp;amp;D facility in Japan to develop cutting-edge semiconductor technology. The cost of the new project is anticipated to be roughly $338 million, of which the Japanese government will subsidize about half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fab Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; The 1980s were marked by lithography asymmetry between the United States and Japan, though Japan became dominant as the country’s indigenous semiconductor market expanded. Japanese manufacturing is not as strong as it was in the 1980s and 1990s. Statistics from Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) show that the Japanese share of the world’s semiconductor market shrank from 50 percent in 1990 to 10 percent today. One factor that affected Japan’s domestic semiconductor market was the entry into the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement in 1986. The agreement called for antidumping guarantees, along with a 20 percent market share provision meant to open the Japanese market to foreign producers over a five-year time frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another factor that restrained Japanese growth of the indigenous semiconductor industry is that Japanese companies invested in dynamic random access memory (DRAM), rather than advanced logic chips. Intense competition from Korean firms in DRAM memory led Japanese companies to double down on DRAM-related skills and accelerate production of DRAM memory chips, moving the Japanese market further away from a focus on computing power. Around the time this decision was made, U.S. markets shifted their focus to computing power rather than memory. Advanced computation capabilities have national security implications, including applications in quantum computing efforts and military advancements, meaning that investments in advanced computing — rather than memory chips — can facilitate increased strategic independence over time and reduce reliance on foreign producers for critical technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits and Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; In June 2021, METI announced the creation of its “Strategy for Semiconductors and the Digital Industry.” A core goal of the new strategy is to maintain Japan’s modest 10 percent of the global market share of semiconductors by 2030. Maintaining that 10 percent market share will cost an estimated $38 billion. In recognizing the weaknesses in its semiconductor supply chain, the government is working to help companies enhance production of chips, large-capacity batteries, and other key materials through subsidy programs. In addition to the public funding boost for Japan’s semiconductor industry, TSMC has announced it will spend $7 billion to open a new production facility in southern Japan, expected to be completed in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2022, the United States and Japan held the first ministerial meeting of the Japan-U.S. Commercial and Industrial Partnership, at which the parties agreed to develop “Basic Principles on Semiconductor Cooperation” to be coordinated by the United States Department of Commerce and METI. At the leadership summit of the two heads of state in late May, the parties announced efforts “to cooperate on diversifying semiconductor production capacity, increasing transparency, coordinating emergency response on shortages, and strengthening semiconductor R&amp;amp;D and workforce development.” The United States and Japan are also working toward creating a working group to facilitate joint research into state-of-the-art semiconductors. They also agreed to establish a “Work Plan on Export Control Cooperation.” These joint initiatives seek to enhance semiconductor supply chain resiliency while limiting the proliferation of sensitive dual-use technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;australia&quot;&gt;AUSTRALIA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from producing some chips used in Wi-Fi and the Mars Rover, Australia is largely a consumer of chips and lacks the direction and commercial will to reenter the strategic semiconductor sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&amp;amp;D Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Australia does have potential strengths based on its history and market dynamics. It has world-class design capability in radio frequency, millimeter wave, photonics, and radar. Australia is also fortunate to have abundant and underdeveloped silica deposits, a critical compound for wafers. Its history of successful mineral exploration and extraction could accelerate the development of domestic silica mines. Alternatively, Australia’s robust materials science, academic, and R&amp;amp;D capabilities are also well positioned to explore silica substitutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fab Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Australian companies involved in the semiconductor industry are small and scattered, and have different technological requirements for semiconductor development. Some of the biggest challenges involved in growing the industry are deciding where to build a foundry and figuring out how to grow the ecosystem. A manufacturing plant will not automatically turn the switch on for the industry. There are currently no large Australian companies whose core business activity is participation in the semiconductor design, development, and production value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits and Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; There are several downside risks for large Australian semiconductor producers. Risks include a lack of historical experience in the sector and a lack of incentives for capital investors, which lack the impetus to launch the typical 5–10-year investment cycle needed to establish the industry. Australian investors are also reluctant to accelerate investments due to the regional competition from Taiwan, as well as a crowded global market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-quadrilateral-security-dialogue&quot;&gt;THE QUADRILATERAL SECURITY DIALOGUE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Quad countries convened in person for the first time in September 2021, the joint statement highlighted that the partners are working together to map semiconductor supply chains. The parties affirmed “positive commitment to resilient, diverse, and secure supply chains of critical technologies, recognizing the importance of government support measures and policies that are transparent and market-oriented.” Joint efforts to build more resilient supply chains and combat nonmarket economic practices represent an enhanced level of coordination against China. Australia and Japan have joined efforts to restrict trade with Russia, but India’s reluctance to join the coordinated response weakens the Quad’s general position vis-à-vis Europe when it comes to friend-shoring semiconductor supply chains. Overall, it remains to be seen which tangible results will materialize from Quad partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-and-conclusion&quot;&gt;Recommendations and Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semiconductor GVCs are inherently complex in nature, meaning there are distinct limitations to what the United States can accomplish unilaterally. Onshoring of semiconductor supply chains is not feasible in the short term. In the long term, onshoring would raise prices, reduce efficiency, and dampen long-term U.S. competitiveness. Thus emerges the need for an affirmative agenda for semiconductor supply chains among allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One fundamental recommendation from interviews conducted for this research project centered around the need to identify tangible goals that will enable governments and the private sector to bolster semiconductor supply chain resiliency. Another recommendation that emerged from this research is the need for the U.S. government to promulgate consistent, predictable policies — particularly related to trade — including collaborating to create a new Information Technology Agreement (ITA) to reduce tariffs on additional ICT goods. Overall, interviewees stressed that the government should avoid blanket export controls that risk dampening investment in allied semiconductor industries and should consider the creation of a new mini-export control regime that could function similarly to the Wassenaar Arrangement. These findings, coupled with an evaluation of the benefits and drawbacks of working with specific countries, make closer cooperation particularly enticing with Belgium, Germany, Japan, and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the United States, in concert with close allies, must identify the goals it seeks to achieve by bolstering efforts to friend-shore supply chains, while simultaneously seeking to dampen the ability of foreign adversaries to gain a competitive edge over next-generation chips. Allied countries need to determine whether their policies are primarily motivated by pandemic-induced supply chain crunches or whether these policies constitute an inherently negative agenda that is reactionary to adversaries’ technological advancements. Once allies have an affirmative agenda, it will fall on countries to collaborate on smart, targeted investments that bolster innovation. These investments should seek to mitigate “small batch” problems that restrain the ability of startups to obtain prototypes of new semiconductors. These policies should also seek to avoid a subsidy war in which multi-government spending results in significant overcapacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to leading efforts in building an affirmative semiconductor supply chain agenda, the United States should work with close allies to promulgate consistent, predictable policies. These include increased certainty about the application of tariffs that affect the semiconductor industry. For example, the USTR finding that Vietnam’s currency manipulation was actionable under Section 301, coupled with labor shortages and Covid-19 regulations, created an environment that led to Samsung relocating some of its production to Indonesia and India. Such a move was costly for the company and an option only available to large firms with adequate agility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should also work with allies to create a new ITA with the goal of reducing tariffs on additional ICT goods. Technology changes quickly in this sector, and the first two ITA iterations do not cover newly developed products and technologies. A new ITA would represent a step forward in continuing liberalization throughout the ICT sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Promulgating consistent trade policy with allies is also crucial. Moreover, the United States should avoid blanket export controls that risk dampening investment in allied semiconductor industries, as well as restraining the ability of U.S. firms to invest in next-generation R&amp;amp;D efforts. If the United States chooses to pursue a more integrated approach to semiconductor supply chains with the European Union and Japan, this decision is likely to have a fundamental impact on existing international export control architecture, potentially leading to the creation of a new framework. The United States should therefore also more seriously consider the creation of a mini-regime, which could function more similarly to the Wassenaar Arrangement. A new mini-regime could also enhance information sharing among allies and increase transparency related to government spending on semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very unlikely that even a highly coordinated mini-regime will prevent China from obtaining critical semiconductor technology in the long run. However, an effective regime can delay that inevitability and buy time for like-minded countries to invest in and create the next generation of semiconductors, increasing tech sector independence and resiliency. Furthermore, a new mini-regime could capitalize on current momentum among a group of 38 countries to coordinate and codify new technology controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given plans in the European Union to fortify and expand its semiconductor capabilities, the United States should work with Brussels in the TTC to institutionalize closer collaboration. The parties should work together to implement frameworks that would facilitate surge capacity for production, including an assistance agreement to ramp up production in cases of supply chain disruptions. While redundancy in production can be helpful in certain instances — for example to ensure an adequate supply of chips used in automobiles — with limited financial resources, the parties should seek to avoid duplicative efforts on next-generation R&amp;amp;D. Overall, increased semiconductor cooperation presents the United States and the European Union with a unique opportunity to build a positive agenda that cements its leadership in critical technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States has long maintained export controls in the semiconductors sector, particularly on chip manufacturing equipment, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and deteriorating relations with China have made national security a much more important part of the trade policy debate. The result is that companies are forced to rethink how they make location decisions. Supply chain management historically has centered around price, quality, and delivery. Now, in this sector in particular, governments have effectively added security and compliance with government policies and regulations as an important additional variable that affects companies’ supply chain location strategies. In an already complex industry operating in an environment of growing geopolitical tensions, cooperation with allies becomes even more important for the private sector and governments alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the United States has long maintained export controls in the semiconductors sector, particularly on chip manufacturing equipment, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and deteriorating relations with China have made national security a much more important part of the trade policy debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both the United States and foreign partners, governments need to identify — and then implement policy based on — where they want to lead and where they can afford to follow. Thus emerges an inherent need to develop an affirmative strategy that identifies end goals and leverages multilateral frameworks as an avenue for achieving those goals. Creating a stronghold over chokepoints throughout semiconductor GVCs affects consumer markets and national security capabilities, thus amounting to geopolitical power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on an assessment of what EU and Quad countries are currently producing, as well as their alignment with U.S. export control policy, the best candidates for friend-shoring U.S. semiconductor supply chains are EU member states and Japan. Within the European Union, the best candidates from a supply chain security perspective, both in terms of national security considerations and overall supply chain resiliency, are Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. Each has an educated population, a relatively open immigration system that can attract foreign talent, and an existing close relationship with the United States on issues of national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For both the United States and foreign partners, governments need to identify — and then implement policy based on — where they want to lead and where they can afford to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, disruptions throughout the semiconductor GVC are likely to persist, making it a more urgent matter for governments and the private sector to minimize ongoing disruptions. The Russian invasion of Ukraine could prolong these trade disturbances and could also usher in a more fractured global trading system in which China and Russia become closer and liberal democracies band together, leaving countries like India awkwardly in the middle. Mounting tension between authoritarian and democratic states, coupled with an injection of social policy into trade agendas, is likely to reshuffle semiconductor GVCs, particularly as the United States reconsiders what qualifies countries to maintain trusted trading partner status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sinking of the Russian Slava-class cruiser Moskva in April this year by a Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship cruise missile may well have been a watershed moment. This is not because it illustrated the risks posed to warships by anti-access capabilities – something already well understood and accounted for in naval circles – but rather because it signposted the potential for smaller states to assure their own maritime sovereignty with little or limited support from larger partners. This, of course, is not just a matter of importance to Ukraine and Russia – it is increasingly a factor in the strategic competition underway in the Indo-Pacific and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though anti-ship cruise missiles are not themselves a gamechanger, they could in future form part of a package of measures including weaponised uncrewed underwater vehicles (UUVs), uncrewed aerial vehicles, and a range of other increasingly affordable capabilities that can enable defenders to impose an exacting, unacceptable cost on potential aggressors. Coupled with options such as containerised missiles on nondescript vessels such as cargo ships, they could significantly limit the ability of revisionist actors to challenge the maritime status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite the lowering of the unit costs, there is more to anti-access/area denial than just buying the latest equipment. To be effective, the defender must be able to combine capabilities into a system of systems, to have real-time local maritime domain awareness, and to exercise slick command and control, all in a bespoke manner to suit particular circumstances. The process of designing and building these system architectures and training people to operate and maintain them may still benefit from partnership. It is here that we see a point of synergy between the stated ambitions of countries such as the UK with a persistently engaged – albeit small – naval force, and the aspirations of coastal states who, in many cases, may seek strategic partnerships with third parties rather than explicit alignments with regional or global hegemons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-lessons-from-ukraine-and-the-concept-of-assured-sovereignty&quot;&gt;The Lessons from Ukraine and the Concept of Assured Sovereignty&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must not read too much into the sinking of the Moskva. The vessel was in many ways decrepit, and its crew may not have been vigilant to the Ukrainian anti-ship cruise missile threat. Well-equipped warships with alert crews should hardly be sitting ducks for missiles, and the engagement could have ended very differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Trends in areas such as electronic miniaturisation are enabling sophisticated guidance and targeting payloads to be incorporated into relatively small effectors&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, we might also consider that the Ukrainian capacity to erect a localised anti-access bubble was less robust than it might have been given more time and greater partner support. For example, the number of anti-ship cruise missiles at Ukraine’s disposal was minimal, and the Neptune (a variant of the Soviet-era KH-35) does not benefit from the characteristics of more modern missiles such as low observability or very high speed. Moreover, Ukraine had little chance to bring its vision of a mosquito fleet – something it intended to build with UK support – into existence before the war began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To consider what such a mosquito fleet might look like, or how assured sovereignty in the maritime domain might work, we could look to countries such as Iran, which combines ground-based missiles with missile-equipped fast-attack craft operating in swarms, midget submarines and weaponised UUVs. The threat the Iranian navy poses is not driven by any one capability, but by its ability to deploy many simultaneously, confusing its adversary’s picture and operating well inside its observe-orient-decide-act loop. This threat would not be insurmountable for a Western navy in a high-intensity fight, but the very costs it could impose serves as an important part of the Iranian maritime deterrent during conditions of constant competition. Harass rather than defeat may often be good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same suite of capabilities that enables offensive action can also enable more defensive purposes with growing potency. Trends in areas such as electronic miniaturisation are enabling sophisticated guidance and targeting payloads to be incorporated into relatively small effectors – something that the UK’s own capabilities like Spear-3 illustrate. This extends to a range of other relatively low-cost, small effectors such as loitering munitions. Consider, for example, the Israeli Harpy – a 500km range munition with a unit cost of $70,000 – or the US Navy’s SLOCUM glider – a low-cost automated surveillance asset which could easily be utilised as a smart mine, capable of designating its own targets. Trends in areas such as additive manufacturing will likely drive the costs of these capabilities down even further. Finally, as North Korea’s testing of a hypersonic glide vehicle shows, with partner support, even states with very limited capabilities can field a small number of more exquisite assets, which – if deployed judiciously – can act as effective deterrents. Combined with traditional green water assets such as frigates, corvettes and diesel electric submarines, they could pose a substantial challenge in areas that a larger adversary might previously have considered permissive sea space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, though effectors are increasingly low-cost, the underpinnings that make them an effective, reliable system are not. For example, the ability to operate effectively against hostile vessels – especially in congested waterways where a substantial amount of neutral shipping may be present – requires a robust and high-fidelity C4ISR capability that can withstand disruption. Consider, for example, the way in which Ukraine’s early warning network was destroyed in the early days of the war. Not only does this require resilient networks and the information architecture needed to fuse data from multiple sources, but it also imposes exacting demands on operators. Skilled operators capable of making decisions with only partial information and a network architecture capable of drawing data from other sources, including proliferating commercial networks, will be critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Assured sovereignty aligns the Royal Navy’s ends with its regional means and dovetails with the objectives of partner states who seek to deter unwanted interference without joining formal military alliances&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why relatively affordable capabilities, such as air defence systems, have typically required substantial advisory missions to enable the creation and operation of a systems architecture. The utilisation of area denial capabilities also requires other organisational competencies. As examples from the Iran–Iraq tanker war – including the attack on the USS Stark and the mine damage to the USS Samuel Roberts – show, damaging the wrong target – even inadvertently – can have international repercussions. The need to classify targets under conditions of limited information demands a sophisticated organisational capacity for information processing, which will become all the more acute when making decisions about when to release weapons capable of self-designation. Finally, though the unit costs of emerging effectors may be cheap, the human capital and infrastructure needed for their manufacture is not. This is likely to be true in other areas, such as the use of automation for data fusion and command and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;persistent-engagement-and-assured-sovereignty&quot;&gt;Persistent Engagement and Assured Sovereignty&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is here that partners can offer choice and value. The development of resilient ISR and the capacity to operate under contested conditions, which navies including the Royal Navy are working to achieve, can be co-developed with partners. Partners from more established forces can add expertise in a number of key areas, from niche capabilities such as the connectors and procedures needed to manoeuvre in littoral spaces, to organisational competencies such as planning and staffing campaigns. In return, the less developed force contributes local area expertise, skilled labour and the determination to maintain its independence. There are opportunities in the process of knowledge exchange which can lead to valuable synergies for all partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Royal Navy looks to build on its presence in the Indo-Pacific, a two-ocean mega-region where it has limited mass and competes with a systemic challenger with the world’s largest navy, it will require a concept that links persistent engagement to desired ends. Assured sovereignty could be precisely such a concept. Not only does it align the Royal Navy’s ends with its regional means but, crucially, it also dovetails with the national political objectives of partner states who seek to deter unwanted interference without joining formal military alliances. The concept could also support the evolution of frameworks such as the Five Power Defence Arrangements or even AUKUS – which, as it evolves beyond an initial focus on delivering submarines to Australia, could emphasise the co-development of capabilities for export to other partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, this is a modern variant of the active defence described by figures such as Sir Julian Corbett as the optimal choice for a weaker maritime power, or of the naval strategy developed by la Jeune Ecole, combining shore-based defence with active hit-and-run attacks by light flotillas. The very tactics and techniques used by China to safeguard its own (and its illegally claimed) maritime territory can now help to safeguard at affordable cost the coasts, territorial waters, maritime infrastructure, and exclusive economic zones of states unwilling to pay tribute to Beijing, without them becoming wholly dependent on Washington. In short, they represent an opportunity to achieve the paramount goal of all small, independent states: assured sovereignty, on their terms.&lt;/p&gt;

Opponents of the regime and even ordinary citizens who have had unauthorized foreign contacts are being thrown into Moscow’s Lefortovo Prison, where in Stalinist times, political prisoners were tortured and executed. Special border agents have been interrogating and intimidating Russians who are trying to leave or return. But even those who have made it out are not safe; exiles who have spoken out are being investigated, and their relatives in Russia are being harassed by the regime. And security police are cracking down on Russian companies that buy foreign rather than Russian raw materials and hardware.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine enters its sixth month, a dramatic shift has occurred in the Kremlin’s security bureaucracy, and it has centered on the agency closest to Putin himself: the Federal Security Service, or FSB. When the war began, the Kremlin planned to use the FSB mainly in Ukraine, as a special operations force that would consolidate a rapid Russian conquest. According to the plan, the Russian tanks rolling into Ukraine would trigger regime change in Kyiv, and a new pro-Moscow leadership, sponsored by FSB spymasters, would take control of the country. At the time, it was the FSB’s foreign intelligence branch — the Fifth Service — that was to carry out this task. It was the only major FSB department, out of a dozen, that was directly involved in preparing for the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As those plans faltered, however, Putin crafted a different, far more comprehensive mission for the FSB: it would be at the forefront of Russia’s total war effort at home as well as its intelligence operations in Ukraine. And every branch of the service would now be involved. Running the new crackdowns in Russia are the FSB’s counterterrorism unit, its counterintelligence service, and its investigative department. Meanwhile, FSB special forces and the military counterintelligence branch are running operations targeting Ukrainian service people in occupied territories and beyond, recruiting Ukrainian agents, and processing those whom the FSB hopes to see prosecuted in show trials. FSB agents are stationed at Russia’s borders, and the Economic Security Service, which is often considered the most corrupt department of the FSB, has been vigorously enforcing Russia’s economic policies. At FSB headquarters at Lubyanka Square in Moscow, the agency’s rank and file have been told to prepare for three-month tours of duty in the occupied territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the FSB spearheads a transformed, increasingly paranoid, and heavily securitized state bureaucracy, the shift has profound implications for the nature of Putin’s rule. In contrast to the largely surveillance-oriented agency of previous years, the FSB has become a far more expansive arm of an increasingly ruthless state. In its sweeping reach into domestic society, foreign affairs, and the military, the FSB has begun to look less like its late-Soviet predecessor, the KGB. It now resembles something much scarier: the NKVD, Stalin’s notorious secret police, which conducted the great purges of the 1930s and maintained an iron lock on Russian society into the early years of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-long-reach-of-lubyanka&quot;&gt;The Long Reach of Lubyanka&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not hard to find signs of the FSB’s evolving strategy. Consider its tactics toward journalists and members of the political opposition. In the past, when it came to the press, the FSB limited itself to spying on journalists critical of the government and encouraging them to leave the country. Even when Ivan Safronov, a former journalist who covered the military for the Russian daily newspaper Kommersant, was arrested on treason charges in the summer of 2020, it was understood as a message to the others: stop writing about sensitive issues or leave the country. In fact, the following year, many Russian journalists were placed on a government list of foreign agents but not arrested, and many went into exile. This exodus continued in the opening phase of the war in Ukraine, when hundreds of Russian journalists and activists fled abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the spring, however, the FSB has set out to reverse the flow. Two months after the war started, for example, it let in the prominent opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza. For years, Kara-Murza has shuttled between the United States, Europe, and Russia, promoting sanctions against Putin’s cronies; since the war started, he has feared that the Kremlin would ban him from entering Russia. But in April, Kara-Murza flew to Moscow and was let in — only to be swiftly thrown in jail, where he has remained ever since, on charges of spreading fake news about the war. In July, another opposition politician, Ilya Yashin, was arrested on identical charges. After Alexei Navalny was arrested and imprisoned — following his own return to Russia in August 2021 — Yashin was the most prominent opposition figure; now, like Navalny and Kara-Murza, he has been locked up and silenced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is no accident. Starting in May 2022, the FSB has been visiting the families of Russian exiles to convey the message that the Russian government is ready to welcome the exiles back. There are also reports that Russian IT specialists who left Russia at the start of the war but returned have been summoned to FSB headquarters and interrogated: the agency was seeking information in particular about Russian exiles who have stayed abroad. Rather than forcing Russians out, where they may be able to encourage opposition movements, the regime has decided that it would be better to keep them under close watch in Russia — an approach last used by the Kremlin during the early stages of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Shifting tactics, the FSB is luring opposition figures back to Russia and arresting them.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the FSB has become bolder in its pursuit of journalists and others who have long been in exile. Here, we can cite our own experience: in March, the internal security department of the FSB initiated a criminal case against one of us, Andrei Soldatov, on charges of spreading fake news about the war, charges that carry a sentence of up to ten years in prison. Soldatov’s bank accounts in Russia have been frozen, and the Russian government has issued formal international warrants to arrest him and extradite him to Russia. The number of Russian journalists who have been threatened with similar charges has only grown. And since most already live in exile, the criminal cases are meant to put further pressure on their relatives back in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally dramatic has been the agency’s growing crackdown on scientists, lawyers, and other Russians who have been involved in activities the regime now regards as suspect. The FSB’s efforts to harass and intimidate Russian scientists who collaborate with foreign research institutions are not new. But since the war began, the FSB has become far more aggressive. On June 30, the agency took extreme action against Dmitry Kolker, the director of the Laboratory of Quantum Optics at Novosibirsk State University, accusing him of treason for purportedly sharing state secrets with China. (He gave a series of lectures in China as part of an exchange program.) Even though Kolker was in a hospital with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, the FSB arrested him and sent him to Lefortovo Prison, where he died three days later. Many Russians were shocked, but this was hardly an isolated incident. A day before Kolker’s arrest, the FSB jailed Dmitry Talantov, a prominent human rights lawyer, who had defended Safronov, the journalist accused of treason by the FSB. Talantov now found himself charged with spreading fake news about the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even mainstream sectors of the Russian economy have come under FSB pressure. Consider Russia’s national health-care system. Since June, the Russian financial monitoring agency, together with the FSB, has investigated medical clinics across the country for prescribing Western drugs rather than Russian ones. The campaign was presented to the public as “cracking down on schemes by foreign pharmaceutical companies that sell their drugs through Russian doctors.” The Kremlin has also asked the FSB to investigate bureaucrats who “failed” to substitute Russian products, like IT technologies, for foreign ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FSB purges have also begun to reach the Russian elite, including senior security officials themselves. In July, three top generals in the Interior Ministry were arrested on embezzlement charges; the operation has been regarded as a message to the interior minister to watch himself — nobody is completely safe in this new security state. This is only the latest in a series of purges that have targeted Oleg Mitvol, a well-connected former prefect of Moscow Precinct, and Vladimir Mau, a leading Russian economist, who is close to the liberal bloc of the government and head of the Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, the major training facility for Russian bureaucrats. Mitvol was thrown into jail; Mau was put under house arrest — events that have unnerved the Moscow financial elites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the most striking change concerns the FSB’s tactics in Ukraine. Before the war, the FSB’s role was mostly to recruit Ukrainian politicians. Now, the agency is running a massive operation to detain large numbers of Ukrainians in Russia and in the occupied territories of Ukraine. The main task of this operation is not to expose Ukrainian terrorists, as the FSB officially claims; rather, it is to process large numbers of Ukrainians in order to recruit assets and send them back to Ukraine, on FSB orders. Nor has the FSB neglected a ruthless pursuit of Ukrainian intelligence agents, as well as the units that defended the Azovstal steel works against an 82-day siege by Russian forces this spring. Along with Russians who are accused of state treason, these high-value Ukrainians have been sent to Lefortovo Prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;back-in-the-ussr&quot;&gt;Back in the USSR&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FSB’s sweeping new role raises larger questions about Putin’s regime. For years, it has been well known that Putin has modeled his security services in part on Soviet practices, including those of the KGB, where he spent almost 16 years. For much of Putin’s time in office — and especially over the past five years, as he sought to shore up his regime — the KGB model made sense. For one thing, in the later decades of the Soviet era, the KGB, although it was powerful, remained a comparatively small organization and preferred a light approach to control. It watched and spied on everyone, from factory workers to ballerinas, but the KGB didn’t seek to carry out large-scale arrests or purges. Instead, it relied on sophisticated forms of intimidation that could make people fall in line without mass repression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other respects, the KGB was also shaped by the politics of the post-Stalin era. Rather than controlled by a single all-powerful leader, it was a bureaucracy that answered to the Communist Party. And although the agency was omnipresent, it was largely invisible: KGB officers hated military uniforms, preferring gray suits instead. The KGB also invested hugely in public relations, sponsoring books and movies promoting the image of the agency as the most intellectual government entity in the country — the only one that could effectively fight corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his first 15 years in power, Putin relied on the FSB but tried to distance it somewhat from the KGB. He wanted the FSB to be his rapid-response team, rushing to him with solutions to his political problems, inside and outside Russia. But after the FSB repeatedly let him down — failing to warn him of color revolutions, Moscow protests, and finally, the Maidan revolution in Kyiv in 2014 — Putin changed the rules. Instead of having the FSB serve as a rapid-response force, he revised its mandate to something much closer to that of the KGB. He made it an instrument for providing political stability through the intimidation of the Russian people, including elites. But the recent moves suggest that Putin is once again shifting course. Instead of the KGB of the 1970s and 1980s, the FSB increasingly resembles Stalin’s secret services, the NKVD, which aimed to a much greater degree at total control of the Russian population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;putins-monster&quot;&gt;Putin’s Monster&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stalin’s NKVD — the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs — was a true monstrosity. Stalin purposely designed the ministry to oversee vast and widely disparate parts of the Soviet state, including the national railway system, Russia’s nuclear program, and the assassination of Stalin’s enemies abroad. The NKVD oversaw police, espionage operations, political repressions, and the Gulag (the Soviet Union’s extensive system of forced labor camps), as well as the construction industry and even public utilities. To conduct internal repressions, the NKVD built up a network of directorates all over the country: to process such large numbers required an enormous security bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NKVD was also heavily militarized. Not only did NKVD officers wear military uniforms and carry military ranks but the agency also had its own military units equipped with heavy weaponry such as tanks and aircraft. At the end of the 1930s, as war in Europe looked increasingly likely, Stalin put the country on a military footing, beginning with his security bureaucracy. Once the war started, NKVD troops set up camps in the occupied territories of Poland and the Baltics to identify troublemakers and recruit agents. The NKVD was also put in charge of a campaign to get Russian exiles to return to Russia at the end of the war. These were people who had fled Soviet Russia, and many of them were persuaded to return — only to end up in Stalin’s camps. In these and other ways, the NKVD was designed for a regime that was constantly at war: with its own political enemies, with former comrades in the country and abroad, and with the West. And what made the NKVD so powerful — and so feared — was that it answered only to Stalin, not to the Communist Party or the Soviet government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the war in Ukraine began, Putin’s rapidly growing security state seems to be inching closer to its Stalinist predecessor. The militarization of the FSB, its new recruitment camps, its increasingly open and brutal tactics all suggest that Putin is looking more closely at the approach of the NKVD — an agency that was forged by a totalitarian state in wartime. And the long war is what the Kremlin is priming the country for.&lt;/p&gt;

This includes the Philippines, which is vulnerable to external threats and aiming to modernize its military by the end of 2027. Japan has developed a close relationship with the Philippines and supported capacity building to help Manila manage an increasingly complex security environment, including concerns about a potential crisis in the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among Japan’s relationships with Southeast Asian countries, its relationship with the Philippines is particularly close. The Fukuda Doctrine, which later became the cornerstone of Japan’s diplomacy with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), was announced by Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda in Manila in August 1977 and focused mainly on economic cooperation. However, security cooperation between the two countries has also developed in recent years. More recently, Japan’s Free and Open Indo-Pacific concept, introduced by former prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2016, accelerated these trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid development of defense cooperation between Japan and the Philippines is due to a shared sense of urgency after China actively pursued maritime expansion in the 2010s. A collision between two Chinese patrol vessels and a Philippine survey vessel at Reed Bank in March 2011 and a standoff at Scarborough Reef in 2012 shocked the Benigno Aquino III administration and caused it to seek defense cooperation with Japan and Australia in addition to its only ally, the United States. Meanwhile, Chinese coercion around the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea began straining Japan-China relations in 2009 and prompted Japan to network more closely with countries around the region to counter Chinese assertiveness throughout the First Island Chain. In a veiled reference to China, Japan’s first national security strategy, unveiled in 2013, states that Japan will strengthen diplomatic and security cooperation with ASEAN countries, which prefer to resolve the South China Sea issue according to the rule of law rather than by force. Thus, defense cooperation between Japan and the Philippines has progressed in countering China’s maritime expansion in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capacity building for Southeast Asian nations, including the Philippines, is critical to addressing the challenges posed by Chinese assertiveness. As David B. Shear, former assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs, noted with regard to U.S. force posture in the region, “In Northeast Asia we have a clear forward line of defense, numerous forward deployed forces, and strong, capable allies. It’s just the opposite in Southeast Asia, where we have a more ambiguous line defense, many fewer forces, and far less capable allies.” Japan has embraced this cause and is working to strengthen the defense capabilities of the Philippines. This paper examines recent developments in defense cooperation between Japan and the Philippines, reviews the security policies of the Benigno Aquino III (2010–2016) and Rodrigo Duterte (2016–2022) administrations, and proposes measures to strengthen the security partnership between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;progress-in-security-cooperation-between-japan-and-the-philippines&quot;&gt;Progress in Security Cooperation between Japan and the Philippines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security partnership between Japan and the Philippines has grown closer in recent years, as evidenced by Japan’s decision in August 2020 to transfer air surveillance radar systems to the Philippines. In June 2021, Japanese minister of defense Nobuo Kishi and Philippine secretary of national defense Delfin Lorenzana held a video teleconference in which they agreed to: (1) strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or any act that would increase tensions, (2) continue to promote bilateral defense cooperation and exchange, and (3) maintain and strengthen the Free and Open Indo-Pacific concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and the Philippines have long had active economic relations and cultural exchanges, but the two countries have made remarkable progress in defense cooperation since the 2010s. In contrast, the relationship between the United States and the Philippines, both treaty allies, has appeared relatively distant in recent years. In February 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte’s entourage was refused entry visas by the United States due to human rights violations, and the Philippines unilaterally notified the United States that it was breaking the Visiting Forces Agreement governing the U.S military presence in the country. In July 2021, U.S. secretary of defense Lloyd Austin visited the Philippines, and the Visiting Forces Agreement was kept in place, but the relationship between the two countries is still in the process of repair. In August 2021, in an address to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Defense Minister Lorenzana stressed that “U.S. support for the modernization of the Philippine Armed Forces would make the Philippines a more reliable ally and would be beneficial to the United States.” However, it is difficult to determine whether concrete progress has been made in security cooperation between the United States and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japan-philippines-security-partnership-before-aquino&quot;&gt;Japan-Philippines Security Partnership before Aquino&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the 2010s, the bilateral relationship between Japan and the Philippines was particularly pronounced on the economic front. Figure 1 summarizes the trends of the Philippines’ major trading partners and shows that while China’s advance in 2020 was remarkable, Japan’s presence has been significant since the 1990s. Figure 2 shows the number of foreign visits of Philippine presidents to select major countries, which reveals emphasis on relations with Japan. Japan also has historically been the largest provider of official development assistance (ODA) to the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Aquino and Duterte Visits to Select Major Partners&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan-Philippines security cooperation started to develop from the early 2000s. During the summit meeting between Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi and Philippine president Gloria Arroyo held on September 15, 2001, immediately after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the two leaders agreed to elevate their relationship to a higher partnership level, including discussions on bilateral, regional, and global security. In addition, they affirmed the need to hold an annual political dialogue on security. Also, in December 2006, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Arroyo met in Manila to discuss a wide range of security issues and signed the “Philippines-Japan Joint Statement on the Partnership of Two Neighboring Countries in Proximity for Comprehensive Cooperation.” The statement pledged that the two countries would promote policy dialogue on security, maritime and consular issues and strengthen joint efforts to prevent and combat human trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has also strengthened ties with the Philippines through diplomatic engagement with ASEAN leaders in many international forums, including the Japan-ASEAN Summit (established in 1977), the Japan-ASEAN Forum (established in 1977), the International Conference on the Future of Asia (established in 1995), ASEAN Plus Three (established in 1997), and the East Asia Summit (established in 2005). In addition, the ASEAN Regional Forum (established in 1994) and, more recently, the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting Plus (established in 2010), where ministers in charge of foreign affairs and defense participate in ASEAN-related meetings to discuss regional security issues, naturally led to an increase in high-level bilateral exchanges between Japan and the Philippines. Prior to 2012, Tokyo and Manila did not pursue formal agreements on defense cooperation. However, in the face of China’s aggressive behavior in the South and East China Seas, Japan and the Philippines were forced to change this thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolving-the-japan-philippines-security-partnership-during-aquino&quot;&gt;Evolving the Japan-Philippines Security Partnership during Aquino&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The March 2011 collision between two Chinese patrol boats and a Philippine survey ship on the Reed Bank and the 2012 Scarborough Shoal standoff gave the Aquino administration a great sense of urgency and prompted it to seek military assistance from Japan and Australia in addition to assistance from its only ally, the United States. At the same time, Japan had its own reasons for approaching the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relations between Japan and China have been strained since a Chinese fishing trawler collided with a Japanese coast guard vessel in the East China Sea in 2010, which was followed by a persistent campaign of Chinese coercion to support its sovereignty claims over the Senkaku Islands, which Japan rejects. Soon after returning to power at the end of 2012, Prime Minister Abe declared, “The islands are Japan’s inherent territory, and we own it, we have effective control over it, and there is no room for negotiation,” and he refused to acknowledge the existence of a dispute over the Senkaku Islands. China responded by increasing the number and frequency of its civilian vessel deployments. Abe then signaled his tough stance on Chinese coercion to support its maritime sovereignty claims in the South China Sea by noting in the country’s first National Security Strategy (released in 2013) that Japan would enhance diplomatic and security cooperation with ASEAN countries that prefer settling South China Sea disputes not by force but by following the rule of law. Thus, in response to China’s maritime aggression, defense cooperation between Japan and the Philippines, which faces similar challenges in the Scarborough Shoal, started to gain momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2012, Japanese minister of defense Satoshi Morimoto and Philippine minister of defense Voltaire Gazmin signed the Japan-Philippines Defense Cooperation Intention Statement, including plans to conduct a wide range of exchanges among defense officials and explore defense cooperation in areas such as capacity building. A few days after this meeting, Philippine foreign secretary Albert del Rosario announced that Japan would provide 10 40-meter-class vessels to the Philippine coast guard (PCG) by the end of the year as part of Japan’s ODA to the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2013, Japanese defense minister Itsunori Onodera and defense secretary Gazmin welcomed the deepening of the “strategic partnership” between Japan and the Philippines in the field of defense, especially in the maritime area, and confirmed that steady progress had been made, including mutual visits between Japan’s chief of the maritime staff and the commander of the Philippine navy; consultations between the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) and the Philippine naval staff; expansion of the JMSDF fleet’s port calls to the Philippines; and implementation of the Pacific Partnership defense exchange in 2012. The two ministers also focused on extending security cooperation between the two countries to the aviation sector, which was emphasized during the visit of the chief of staff of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force to the Philippines. At the same meeting, Secretary Gazmin proposed allowing the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) access to bases in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan also conducted humanitarian assistance and disaster relief activities in the Philippines, which was severely damaged by Typhoon Haiyan in mid-November 2013. Japan dispatched three JMSDF destroyers (the transport ship Osumi, the large destroyer Ise, and the supply ship Towada), three CH-47 transport helicopters, three UH-1 transport helicopters, two KC-767 air tankers, seven C-130 transport aircraft, one U-4 support aircraft, and a maximum of about 1,180 personnel to conduct medical and epidemic prevention activities, rescue operations, and the transport of relief supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2013, President Aquino and Prime Minister Abe also exchanged views on the regional and international situation, including issues surrounding the South China Sea and China’s establishment of an air defense identification zone, and confirmed that they would work even more closely together to address regional and international challenges as the regional security environment becomes increasingly severe. After the meeting, Japanese foreign minister Fumio Kishida and Philippine foreign minister del Rosario signed a letter regarding the “provision of patrol boats to the Philippine Coast Guard.” In June 2014, Abe and Aquino met again and exchanged views on the role of the United States in the region. Prime Minister Abe welcomed the recently agreed Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement between the Philippines and the United States, as it would contribute to regional peace and stability by strengthening U.S. presence in the region, including improving disaster response capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his official visit to Japan in June 2015, President Aquino held in-depth discussions with Prime Minister Abe on regional peace and stability. The two leaders issued two documents, a joint declaration on “A Strengthened Strategic Partnership for Advancing the Shared Principles and Goals for Peace, Security and Growth in the Region and Beyond” and an accompanying action plan. The joint declaration stated that the relationship between the two countries reflects common ideals and goals to ensure regional peace and stability and referenced Chinese behavior by expressing serious concerns about unilateral actions to change the status quo in the South China Sea. In the action plan, the two governments committed to promoting security cooperation in various areas, including intelligence protection, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, maritime security, the provision of defense equipment, technical cooperation, and capacity-building support. The two leaders also welcomed the signing of a contract for the construction and acquisition of 10 patrol vessels and expressed their intention to continue and accelerate talks on strengthening maritime domain awareness (MDA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security partnership between Japan and the Philippines, promoted under the Aquino administration, was intended to counter China’s advances in the South China Sea. However, Philippine foreign policy under President Duterte took a different direction. Duterte prioritized economic engagement with China, downplayed territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea and the challenges posed by Chinese coercion, and seemed to distance the Philippines from the United States, as evidenced by his declared intent to nullify the Visiting Forces Agreement with the United States. Despite apparent tensions in Philippine-U.S. security relations, the two countries confirmed in 2019 that the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty will be invoked in the event of an attack on the Philippines in the South China Sea. Furthermore, the Philippines was one of the first ASEAN countries to announce its support for the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) trilateral security partnership announced in 2020. These Philippine actions are understandable given the Philippines’ strategic location along the First Island Chain and the importance of cooperation with the United States and other regional players to counter Chinese assertiveness across the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this complicated period in U.S.-Philippines relations, Japan facilitated regular consultations with the Duterte administration to strengthen security ties. In September 2016, Prime Minister Abe held his first summit meeting with President Duterte in Laos. The two leaders agreed to cooperate in the field of maritime security by transferring a JMSDF training aircraft (TC-90) to the Philippine navy and continuing to promote security and defense cooperation by improving the MDA capabilities of the Philippines, supporting pilot training, strengthening the maintenance infrastructure of the Philippine navy, and delivering the first 40-meter-class large patrol boat to the Philippines. During a visit to Japan in October of the same year, President Duterte witnessed the signing of a letter regarding the lease of five JSDF TC-90 maritime reconnaissance aircraft to the Philippines to monitor Chinese activities in the South China Sea and a document to strengthen the PCG by granting the construction of two ships. President Duterte also referenced the prospect of military exercises between the Philippines and Japan in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2017, Prime Minister Abe paid a two-day official visit to Manila for a summit meeting with Duterte, stating that Japan would further enhance the maritime capabilities of the Philippines through the provision of patrol vessels and training and that the JSDF would participate in that year’s joint U.S.-Philippines Balikatan exercise. President Duterte thanked Japan for its assistance in enhancing capabilities in the field of maritime security and counterterrorism, particularly the provision of patrol vessels and small speed boats and the loan of the TC-90. One U.S. analyst observed that Abe’s visit reflected “Tokyo’s ambition to keep up with growing Chinese influence in the geopolitically strategic Southeast Asian country by ensuring steady flows of aid and investment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By March 2018, Japan had completed the delivery of all five TC-90s to the Philippine navy, which are expected to boost its capabilities in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; humanitarian assistance; disaster relief; and maritime air surveillance. Additionally, Japan completed the delivery of 10 multi-role capable vessels to the PCG in August 2018. These vessels are used for search and rescue, marine environmental protection, pollution control, humanitarian and disaster relief, and enforcement of maritime laws. In June 2018, the Japan Ministry of Defense announced that it had decided to transfer parts and other items from UH-1 multi-purpose helicopters retired from the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force to the Philippines at no cost. The free transfer of UH-1 parts to the Philippines was the second military equipment transfer to the Philippines since May 2016, when the free transfer of used Japanese patrol aircraft, ships, and other JSDF equipment became possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the momentum for strengthening Japan-Philippines defense cooperation was not lost during the Covid-19 pandemic, even though face-to-face personnel exchanges were temporarily suspended. In August 2020, the Japan Ministry of Defense announced that a contract had been signed between Mitsubishi Electric and the Philippine Department of National Defense regarding air surveillance radars. In July 2021, the first air-to-air bilateral training was conducted between the Japan Air Self-Defense Force and the Philippine air force at Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines, and in June 2022, General Izutsu Shunji, chief of staff of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, and Lieutenant General Connor Anthony D. Canlas Sr., commanding general of the Philippine air force, were present in the second joint training. During his stay in the Philippines, General Izutsu stated “both nations, the Philippines and Japan, are engaging in increasing surveillance capability (and have) interest in engaging in the space situation awareness.” He also mentioned the possibility of cooperation on air surveillance radars, in terms of software to control the radars, as well as operational training for the Philippine air force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-policy-of-the-aquino-administration-20102016&quot;&gt;Security Policy of the Aquino Administration: 2010–2016&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As demonstrated by the preceding chapter, security cooperation between Japan and the Philippines increased dramatically in both quantity and quality in the 2010s, especially during Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s tenure. Japan’s deepening of defense cooperation with the Philippines is aimed at enhancing the presence of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) in Southeast Asia and improving deterrence in the region as a whole by supporting defense capacity building. Japan should seek to further strengthen its security partnerships, particularly interoperability. In order to consider how best to build a more robust security partnership between Japan and the Philippines, it is important to understand the evolution of Philippine defense policy in response to drastic changes in the regional security environment since the 2010s, when China became more assertive with respect to its maritime sovereignty claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Benigno Aquino took office in June 2010, he promised to eradicate poverty and combat corruption and announced a policy to promote stable economic development and peaceful conflict resolution with domestic rebel groups. The content of this inaugural speech clearly shows that the initial threat perception of the Philippines at that time was directed toward domestic threats such as the rebels in Mindanao. The island of Mindanao, located in the south of the Philippines, has long been a predominantly Muslim area, but many Christians settled there under immigration policies dating back to the colonial era. The region has long been beset by conflicts as a result. Aquino pursued peace negotiations with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), and in 2014, the government of the Philippines signed the Bangsamoro Comprehensive Peace Agreement with the MILF. However, Aquino’s perceptions of the regional security environment shifted after a Philippine oil exploration vessel was intercepted by a Chinese ship near Reed Bank in March 2011 and after a standoff between the Philippines and China over Scarborough Shoal that lasted about two months, starting in April 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Aquino took the two incidents as an opportunity to review the military posture of the country, which had been focused on domestic governance, and began a full-scale modernization effort to make the military more capable of defending the region against external threats. Under a long-term plan, the Aquino administration slowly but steadily built a defense posture capable of dealing with maritime and air threats, despite tight finances, by acquiring two major pieces of equipment: two U.S. Coast Guard Hamilton-class cutters for the Philippine navy and 12 South Korean FA-50 fighter planes for the Philippine air force. In response to China’s violations of Philippine sovereignty, Aquino developed a new defense strategy with four pillars: (1) formulating the Revised National Armed Forces Modernization Act; (2) building maritime domain awareness; (3) rebuilding air defense posture; and (4) seeking cooperation with other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;formulating-the-revised-national-armed-forces-modernization-act&quot;&gt;Formulating the Revised National Armed Forces Modernization Act&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As early as July 2010, Aquino had ordered a comprehensive review of the defense system and announced his intention to push for the modernization of the air force for territorial defense. However, in response to the two incidents mentioned above and with external threats in mind, he embarked on a full-scale effort to modernize the military. In December 2012, six months after the impasse at the Scarborough Shoal, he signed Republic Act No. 10349. The act revised Republic Act No. 7898, otherwise known as the AFP Modernization Act, which expired in December 2011 without any significant pieces of equipment acquired for the military. The revised act extended the military modernization program to December 2027. The first phase of the plan under this act was from 2013 to 2017, the second phase is from 2018 to 2022, and the third phase will be from 2023 to 2027. The total funding amount for the first five years is at least 75 billion Philippine pesos ($1.5 billion). Under this long-term plan, the Aquino administration was able to acquire big-ticket assets, such as two former U.S. Coast Guard cutters for the Philippine navy and 12 South Korean FA-50 fighter jets for the Philippine air force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-maritime-domain-awareness&quot;&gt;Building Maritime Domain Awareness&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Philippines, a country with 7,641 islands and a coastline longer than that of the United States, the importance of establishing maritime domain awareness (MDA) has long been a necessity. MDA is defined as “the effective understanding of any activity associated with the maritime environment that could impact the security, safety, economy or environment.” The Philippine coastal monitoring system was originally based on a human intelligence network, which lacked the means to verify, confirm, or establish patterns of reported sightings and prevented timely and effective monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009, at the end of the Arroyo administration, Republic Act No. 9993 was passed, separating the coast guard from the navy. In September 2011, a little more than a year after taking office, the Aquino administration organized the National Coast Watch System by Executive Order No. 57. The objectives of these two movements were to enhance maritime situational awareness from Philippine territorial waters, including the South China Sea, to its exclusive economic zone. The Aquino administration decided that the mainstay of the National Coast Watch System would be the coast guard and established the headquarters of the National Coastal Watch Center in the coast guard headquarters compound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rebuilding-air-defense-posture&quot;&gt;Rebuilding Air Defense Posture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippine air force retired all of its mainstay F-5 fighter jets in 2005. From then until the arrival of the first FA-50 fighter jets from South Korea in 2015, the Philippines did not operate fighter jets, and the Aquino administration had to rebuild its air defense posture from scratch. In addition, based on available public information, the radar coverage of the air force at the time was probably limited. For this reason, the Philippines had to urgently introduce fighter jets and air surveillance radar systems to reestablish the Philippines’ air defense posture. In 2014, following the modernization act passed at the end of 2012, the Philippine air force developed a long-term blueprint for rebuilding the Philippines’ air defense posture, known as “Flight Plan 2028.” In the same year, a contract was signed with South Korea for the introduction of FA-50 fighter jets, with flight training conducted in parallel in South Korea. In addition, the government decided at the end of 2014 to introduce three sets of air surveillance radar systems from Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;seeking-cooperation-with-other-countries&quot;&gt;Seeking Cooperation with Other Countries&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the formulation of the Revised National Armed Forces Modernization Act at the end of 2012, budgetary constraints and a lack of human resources to operate the equipment limited the Philippines’ efforts to develop the naval and air force capabilities necessary for territorial defense. Therefore, it was natural for the Philippines to compensate for those limitations by seeking defense cooperation with the United States, its ally, and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the security relationship between the Philippines and the United States after the Cold War was not stable. In September 1991, the Philippine Senate refused to renew the Philippines-U.S. Military Base Agreement, the legal basis for stationing U.S. troops in the Philippines, which resulted in the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country and the loss of the U.S. military presence in the region. But the Chinese occupation of Mischief Reef in 1994 caused the Philippines to reaffirm the importance of the U.S. presence, leading to the signing of the Visiting Forces Agreement in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2000, security cooperation between the United States and the Philippines began in earnest as part of the war on terrorism, especially operations against the Abu Sayyaf. Unlike groups such as the MILF, which aimed to gain independence from the government, Abu Sayyaf was increasingly associated with al Qaeda, which was committed to global jihad, and Jemaah Islamiyah, which aimed to create an Islamic state in Southeast Asia. In January 2002, the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom – Philippines, and until the end of the operation in 2014, an average of 500 to 600 U.S. special forces personnel were stationed in the Philippines annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes in U.S. diplomacy in the early 2010s were also a factor that allowed the Aquino administration to deepen security cooperation with Washington. In 2011, the Obama administration announced a “rebalancing policy” to allocate more military and economic resources to the Asia-Pacific region. In response, the Aquino administration deepened security cooperation with the United States. Then, in 2014, the two countries signed the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, which institutionalized the bilateral alliance by allowing the United States to rotate troops into the Philippines for extended periods of time and to build and operate both U.S. and Philippine military facilities at bases in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aquino administration also deepened security ties with Australia. The two countries had already signed a Status of Forces Agreement in 2007 similar to the Visiting Forces Agreement signed by the United States and the Philippines. The agreement allowed Australian troops to stay in the Philippines, guaranteed their legal status, and facilitated joint Australia-Philippines counterinsurgency training. But the Philippine Senate did not ratify the agreement until 2012, likely in response to China’s increased assertiveness. In 2013, the Australian government’s White Paper on Defence devoted an entire chapter to international defense engagement and proposed greater involvement in Southeast Asia. As a result, security cooperation between Australia and the Philippines has deepened partly because of Australia’s proactive stance on regional diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-policy-of-the-duterte-administration-20162022&quot;&gt;Security Policy of the Duterte Administration: 2016–2022&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rodrigo Duterte was inaugurated as the 16th president of the Philippines in June 2016 and had gained popularity during the campaign for his blunt statements on policy matters. His approach to foreign policy upon taking office also attracted attention. Duterte announced that he would take a tough stance on drug eradication, stating in his policy speech, “We will not stop until the last drug lord, the last financier and the last pusher have surrendered or been put behind bars. Or below the ground if they so wish.” He did not get along well with the United States after President Obama called for an end to human rights abuses related to the drug war. Duterte distanced himself from the United States and also played down a ruling by an international tribunal that dismissed China’s claims to much of the South China Sea, a case which had been brought to the Permanent Court of International Justice by the Aquino administration. And Duterte asked former president Fidel V. Ramos to make an unofficial visit to China to start informal bilateral talks, in stark contrast to Aquino’s firm stance against China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the election period in April 2016, Duterte criticized Aquino’s acquisition of FA-50 fighter jets as a waste of money because they were inadequate to deter China, could not be used to fight insurgents, and could at best only be used for ceremonial flights. This appeared to place the Philippine military’s modernization program in jeopardy. However, a close look at security policy up to the end of 2021 shows no evidence that the Duterte administration significantly altered Aquino-era policies. Rather, there appears to have been a certain degree of continuity under the Revised National Armed Forces Modernization Act. From this perspective, the security policy of the Duterte administration will be reviewed in four areas: (1) continuing implementation of the Revised National Armed Forces Modernization Act; (2) enhancing maritime situational awareness; (3) enhancing air defense posture; and (4) deepening security cooperation with countries other than the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;continuing-implementation-of-the-revised-national-armed-forces-modernization-act&quot;&gt;Continuing Implementation of the Revised National Armed Forces Modernization Act&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was initially believed that President Duterte’s security policy would prioritize domestic security to strengthen counterterrorism capabilities. Lieutenant General Ricardo Visaya, incoming chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), confirmed, “Duterte wants night fighting capabilities, so we will prioritize this.” However, immediately after Duterte’s inauguration, Defense Minister Delfin Lorenzana declared, “Territorial defense is one of the priorities of the Duterte administration. It is very important as we need to protect our territories against encroachment by other parties.” He also noted that the 15-year modernization program of the AFP would continue as scheduled, a sign that the Duterte administration would not abandon the modernization plan enacted by the previous administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippine National Defense Strategy published in November 2018 clarified that the Department of National Defense would sustain its effort to improve territorial defense capabilities through continued implementation of the AFP Capability Upgrade Program and the AFP Modernization Program. It is evident that the security policy of the Duterte administration, which in the early years of the administration was thought to be focused on fighting insurgents, did not did not deviate much from that of the Aquino administration and ensured a certain degree of continuity and consistency thanks to the Revised National Armed Forces Modernization Act. Toward the end of his administration, Duterte strongly promoted the modernization of the AFP, so much so that an active-duty general assessed that “the AFP has always been grateful for the direction and support of the Commander-in-Chief [President Duterte] in continuously improving its capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enhancing-maritime-domain-awareness&quot;&gt;Enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2021, the Philippine government discovered a Chinese “fishing fleet” consisting of 220 vessels around Julian Felipe Reef in the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone. Defense Minister Lorenzana said, “We call on the Chinese to stop this incursion and immediately recall these boats violating our maritime rights and encroaching into our sovereign territory.” Further calls for action ensued on social media, with Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin protesting on Twitter. Images released by the Philippine coast guard (PCG) in April 2021 showed six Chinese-registered vessels around the reef and the PCG patrolling the area by boat. In September 2021, when asked about Julian Felipe Reef, Vice Admiral Leopoldo Laroya, the PCG commander, stated, “At present, we have been maintaining a continuous patrol of the West Philippine Sea. As far as Chinese fishing vessels are concerned, we have been in contact with some of them, and after due warning given to them, they leave the area.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is difficult to determine whether the Chinese ships that had gathered on the reef were dispersed as a result of the PCG patrols, it is clear that Philippine maritime domain awareness (MDA) capabilities have improved to some extent, as evidenced by the protests of government officials and the PCG response to the incident outlined above. From 2013 to 2017, U.S. defense industry giant Raytheon was responsible for building the coastal surveillance system and designing the Philippines’ National Coastal Surveillance Center, with headquarters in Manila and two branches in Cebu in the central Philippines and on Palawan Island bordering the South China Sea. In addition, in 2016, at the end of the Aquino administration, the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea, chaired by the president’s national security adviser, was established as an interagency organization between the Office of the President, the Department of National Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the AFP, and the PCG. The task force remained intact during the Duterte administration and furthered efforts to enhance MDA. Presidents Aquino and Duterte adopted different approaches to China, but that did not affect the activities of the PCG, as shown in Table 1. In particular, the PCG has added 15 patrol boats to its fleet over the 10-year period from 2011 to 2021, including 10 multi-role response vessels from Japan. In addition, since 2017, the country has conducted trilateral patrols in the Sulu and Celebes Seas with Indonesia and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1DV8kNQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: PCG Personnel and Equipment from Aquino to Duterte&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2022, the Philippines announced its intention to introduce supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles from India to improve naval defense in the South China Sea. “As head of procuring entity (HOPE), I recently signed the Notice of Award for the Philippine Navy Shore-Based Anti-Ship Missile Acquisition Project,” Defense Secretary Lorenzana wrote in a Facebook post. Gregory Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, praised this decision as the “most strategic purchase the AFP has made in years.” On the other hand, a weakness is the lack of the “kill chain” between sensors and shooters for targeting moving maritime targets, which is required for robust technical and procedural capability. However, through training and expected future cooperation with partner countries, the AFP will strengthen its deterrent capabilities over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enhancing-air-defense-posture&quot;&gt;Enhancing Air Defense Posture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2021, two FA-50PH fighter jets of the Philippine air force scrambled against an unidentified aircraft that had violated its airspace. In military aviation parlance, “scramble” refers to the immediate deployment of fighter aircraft to intercept an unknown or hostile aircraft. “The Philippine Air Defense Control Center (PADCC), through its radars, detected an unidentified inbound aircraft in the Philippine Air Defense Identification Zone (PADIZ), approximately 120 nautical miles northwest of Bolinao, Pangasinan,” Philippine air force (PAF) spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Maynard Mariano said in a statement. “In the past decades, aircraft flying without clearance would willfully violate the Philippine airspace knowing that they will not be challenged. Today, our airspace is being closely monitored jointly by the PAF and the CAAP [Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines],” he said. However, since there are no reports of similar scrambles since that incident, it is difficult to assess the air defense posture of the Philippines. But since the first 2 of the 12 FA-50 fighter jets from South Korea were acquired in 2015, this capability has steadily strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the construction of the MDA progressed under the Duterte administration, the restructuring of the air defense posture, which was initially feared because of Duterte’s statement that “fighter jets are a waste of money,” also advanced without major impediments. The acquisition plan for Israeli-made air defense radars established under the Aquino administration appears to have been executed, with radars installed in the Gozar Air Station near Mindoro Island, the Paredes Air Station located in the northern part of Luzon, and Mt. Salakot located in Palawan. In addition, a Japanese radar manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric will be installed in the near future, although the timing is unknown, and steady progress is being made in building a Philippine Air Defense Identification Zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deepening-security-cooperation-with-countries-other-than-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Deepening Security Cooperation with Countries other than the United States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the 2018 Philippine National Defense Strategy defines the United States as “the only treaty ally of the Philippines,” bilateral security cooperation did not progress under the Duterte administration and arguably regressed compared to the Aquino administration. During his first visit to China, Duterte said, “I announce my separation from the United States,” and his foreign policy was dubbed “Duterte’s Dalliance with China.” Duterte’s approach did not change after the transition to the Trump administration in the United States. Although Duterte expressed thanks to Trump for the support of U.S. special forces during the battle for Marawi against Islamic State militants in 2017, the regular U.S.-Philippines military exercise known as Balikatan was scaled back to about 5,500 participants from more than 10,000 the previous year, and the emphasis of the exercise was shifted from military training to disaster response. Duterte’s decision to renounce the Visiting Forces Agreement also weakened momentum for bilateral security cooperation, and Japan and Australia tried to fill the void during this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While relations with the United States soured under the Duterte administration, the security partnership between the Philippines and Australia deepened through counterterrorism operations and joint exercises under Balikatan. During the Marawi City siege in 2017, Australia sent Orion aircraft to support intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions and sent military personnel to advise and support counterinsurgency operations. In addition, in October 2017, after the operation, the Philippines and Australia signed a security agreement on capacity building and counterterrorism. This enabled the Philippine navy to conduct capacity-building activities through Royal Australian Navy port visits. When Australian naval vessels visited the Philippines in November 2017, the two navies conducted a humanitarian assistance and disaster relief exercise in Subic Bay for demonstration purposes while President Duterte was onboard the Australian vessel HMAS Adelaide, and he expressed his appreciation for their cooperation against terrorism. Describing why security cooperation between the Philippines and Australia deepened during this period, Professor Renato Cruz De Castro of De La Salle University said it was “the best way for the Philippines to avoid succumbing headlong to China’s interests.” De Castro has further argued that the two middle powers of Japan and Australia played an important role in the modernization of the Philippine military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines was not prepared to adequately defend against external threats when China began to pursue maritime expansion in the 2010s. Both Aquino and Duterte emphasized the need for infrastructure development in the Philippines while recognizing budgetary constraints regarding the acquisition, maintenance, and improvement of defense equipment. As the Philippines continues to develop its maritime security and air power capabilities, it will need not only hardware in the form of defense equipment but also education, training, and communication networks that are critical to the success of any military modernization project. Japan has actively supported the Philippines by promoting defense exchanges and capacity building, but in order to take the Japan-Philippines security relationship to the next level, it will be necessary to conclude agreements that facilitate information sharing and joint training. Japan can also play an important role in encouraging security cooperation between the Philippines and the United States while sustaining its own efforts to enhance the capacity of the Philippine air force to strengthen preparedness and deterrence in an increasingly complex regional security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the security partnership between Japan and the Philippines could be strengthened through several actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Hold regular foreign and defense ministerial meetings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2022, the first foreign and defense ministerial meeting (2+2) between Japan and the Philippines was held. The joint statement issued by the two countries declares that they will consider concluding a Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) for facilitating reciprocal visits and an Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) for exchanging goods and services. The two governments also agreed to meet on a regular basis to align their strategic perspectives on developments in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convening the 2+2 regularly is essential for the development of a strong bilateral security relationship and networking with other countries in the region. Australia was the first country other than the United States with which Japan established a 2+2 framework, and the number of such engagements with other countries has grown, as shown in Table 2. While Japan does not necessarily maintain strong security relationships with all the countries it has engaged under the 2+2 framework, regular meetings are a prerequisite for building strong security partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/r9DpD8B.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Japan’s 2+2 Meetings (Excluding the United States)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of the U.S.-Japan 2+2 shows that since the first meeting in September 1960, it has functioned as an important consultative body to consider a variety of issues related to consultations under the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and bilateral cooperation in the security field. Just as former U.S. secretary of state James Baker proposed in 1990 to upgrade the U.S.-Japan 2+2 to its current ministerial level, it is a natural step to encourage consultations between Japan and the Philippines above the vice-ministerial-level meetings between the foreign and defense authorities of Japan and the Philippines that have already taken place nine times. The Japan-Australia security relationship has developed remarkably in recent years, with the signing of a Japan-Australia RAA in January 2022 to facilitate joint training and the Australian Department of Defence announcing in April 2022 that an Australian KC-30A aerial refueling aircraft had successfully tested aerial refueling on a Japanese F-2 fighter jet. Additionally, both countries coordinate closely with the United States under the Trilateral Security Dialogue. The three countries should coordinate their respective approaches to defense cooperation with the Philippines and make effective use of each country’s limited resources to enhance the role of the Philippines as a regional defense partner. Japan reflects the outcome of those discussions in the agenda for the Japan-Philippines 2+2 to establish and implement common strategic objectives for defense cooperation in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Establish a formal agreement or de facto framework for information sharing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and the Philippines should conclude an information security agreement or an equivalent de facto framework for information sharing to enhance their capacity to jointly assess regional security dynamics. Such an agreement is the foundation (“infrastructure”) of security cooperation and is essential if Japan-Philippines defense cooperation is to deepen in the future. Such an agreement would also enable the two countries to share information on defense equipment and military operations and would facilitate defense equipment exports and joint training. Since Japan first signed a General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) with the United States in 2007, it has added eight other GSOMIA partners in the following order: the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), France, Australia, the United Kingdom, India, Italy, South Korea, and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2020, the Sankei Shimbun reported that the government of Japan was considering sharing information with the Philippines on air defense radar exports. According to the article, several Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) officials stated that “information on the Bashi Strait is becoming indispensable for Japan’s defense.” Since 2016, China’s People’s Liberation Army Air Force has conspicuously dispatched aircraft to the Pacific Ocean through the Miyako Strait between Miyako Island and Okinawa as well as the Bashi Strait between Luzon Island in the Philippines and Taiwan. Experts have suggested that if Japan and the Philippines can share information on the locations of Chinese military aircraft, it will be possible to facilitate countermeasures against China’s attempts to project air power beyond the First Island Chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When sharing sensitive information, it is essential to introduce strict penalties in case of leakage. The government of Japan enacted the Specially Designated Secrets Act in December 2013 and will have to initiate in-depth discussions with the Philippines on how the country can introduce similar measures. If that process takes time, both governments should consider establishing a de facto information-sharing framework, to the extent possible under domestic laws, until the agreement is concluded and aim to effectively enhance the situational awareness capacity of the Philippines as soon as possible. Although the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness is a multilateral initiative, it is a good example of a de facto framework because it allows unclassified information sharing by using existing technologies and institutions without concluding a de jure specific security protection agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the mere existence of such agreements does not automatically facilitate bilateral security cooperation. For example, the Moon Jae-in administration of South Korea announced in 2019 its intention to abrogate the GSOMIA with Japan, but under pressure from the United States, the notification was suspended just before it expired. The Moon administration took the position that the GSOMIA could be abrogated at any time, depending on South Korea’s decision. However, NBC News points out that during the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States provided Ukraine with real-time intelligence such as geospatial data, intercepted communications, and targeting information. Establishing such a framework for sharing classified information in peacetime rather than in wartime will greatly improve regional deterrence and capabilities to cope with urgent situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Conclude a Reciprocal Access Agreement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Institutional arrangements such as the Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) Japan recently concluded with Australia are needed to facilitate joint training and exercises between the JSDF and Philippine armed forces (AFP). In June 2015, President Aquino expressed interest in signing a similar Visiting Forces Agreement with Japan and suggested that both governments recognize the need for such a framework. Professor Ken Jimbo of Keio University said, “The role of the SDF under the Indo-Pacific Initiative should be expanded,” and “to this end, it is necessary to conclude the Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) with India, the Philippines, and Singapore.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines has a Visiting Forces Agreement with the United States and a Status of Forces Agreement with Australia. The April 2022 Japan-Philippines 2+2 joint statement noted that Japan and the Philippines should start&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . . to consider frameworks to facilitate reciprocal visits as well as reciprocal provision of supplies and services in order to further enhance and facilitate cooperation such as exercises between Japan Self-Defense Forces and the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Going forward, the Japanese side will proceed with deliberations, including on the possibilities of concluding a reciprocal access agreement and an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the government of Japan is initiating or considering negotiations with the United Kingdom and France regarding RAAs, similar to its agreements with Australia, in order to maintain peace and stability in the region. However, it took about seven and a half years to conclude the Japan-Australia RAA due to concerns such as Japan’s use of the death penalty. Therefore, it may be difficult for a Japan-Philippines RAA to be signed soon, but such a de jure framework will be necessary to make training and exercises between the Philippines and Japan smoother, which will deepen the Japan-Philippines security partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Promote further transfer of defense equipment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan should promote more exports of defense equipment to improve interoperability between the JSDF and AFP. As noted above, radars made by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation will be transferred from Japan to the Philippines. Since the easing of Japan’s Three Principles on the Transfer of Defense Equipment in 2014, Japan tried to secure agreements to export submarines to Australia and surveillance radars to Thailand but failed in both cases. However, there have already been several successful cases between Japan and the Philippines, such as the provision of TC-90s and UH-1 parts. There are also reports that the Japan Air Self-Defense Force is considering human resource development projects with the Philippines connected to radar exports. Packaging defense equipment exports with training initiatives would serve as a foundation for deepening Japan-Philippines defense cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s Medium Term Defense Program states: “The government as a whole will promote the appropriate overseas transfer of defense equipment under the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology.” Based on Japan’s policy, Japan’s Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Agency (ATLA) launched a feasibility study for the overseas transfer of defense equipment in April 2020 as a “new initiative for promoting equipment transfer” (Figure 3). In this new initiative, a contract is signed with a trading company at the start of the survey, the public and private sectors collaborate in the process of narrowing down the scope of equipment to be covered, and the project concept is eventually materialized through discussions between the public and private sectors. Initially, surveys will be conducted in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and it is hoped that these efforts will be carried out in the Philippines as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rui Matsukawa, a member of Upper House of the Diet representing the Liberal Democratic Party, expressed her concern that the private sector in Japan is assuming all the risks involved in defense equipment contracts and said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will actively promote the overseas transfer of defense equipment as a defense policy. To this end, the government of Japan should take responsibility for establishing an adequate system centered on Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Agency. In addition, it is important to appropriately ease the strict application of the three principles of defense equipment transfer to the corners of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She further insists that this point should be included in the National Security Strategy and other related documents to be revised later this year. She also suggests that “businesspeople working for trading companies should be hired as defense attachés in charge of equipment transfer for a limited period of time, and they should work in Japanese embassies in countries where there are likely to be prospects for development.” Overlapping with ATLA’s efforts, if the Japanese embassies in the Philippines, in addition to the above four countries, were to appoint such personnel, it could be a breakthrough in promoting the transfer of defense equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Image Feasibility Study Launched by ATLA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Implement more proactive and strategic overseas development assistance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan should utilize overseas development assistance (ODA) proactively and strategically to reduce the budgetary burden of defense purchases on the Philippines. Under the “Non-Project Grant Aid for Provision of Japanese Disaster Reduction Equipment” agreement signed in March 2015, Japan provided the “Life-Saving System” in October 2021 to the AFP, which includes the JSDF’s electro-hydraulic equipment, cutters, spreaders, electric pumps, acoustic probes, lighting equipment with generators, boats for use in situations such as tsunamis and guerrilla rains, life jackets, life-saving belts, and other equipment and materials necessary for saving lives during disasters. In November 2021, the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force conducted a briefing for the AFP on the handling of life-saving equipment to efficiently utilize the equipment during disaster response. Japan’s 2020 White Paper on Development Cooperation states that Japan will continue to leverage its various forms of support, including ODA, in its efforts to realize a Free and Open Indo-Pacific. The white paper also outlines a policy of working with the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the European Union to help developing countries in various fields such as maritime safety and disaster management, in which ODA is playing an important role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2014, at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, Prime Minister Abe said that Japan would combine various options to support developing countries in the region, including strategic use of ODA (e.g., provision of patrol vessels, dispatch of experts), support for capacity building by the JSDF, and defense equipment and technology cooperation. In 2015, the government of Japan revised the ODA Charter and established the Development Cooperation Charter, which clearly states the philosophy that ODA can be used to support the military forces of other countries for “non-military purposes such as public welfare or disaster-relief purposes” and that “such cases will be considered on a case-by-case basis in light of their substantive relevance.” The capacity-building projects by the JSDF cover 15 countries mainly in Southeast Asia and are conducted annually for the AFP in a wide range of areas, as shown below in Table 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/saMU8Pa.png&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: Japanese Capacity-Building Assistance to the Philippines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, as mentioned above, opportunities for defense equipment transfers between Japan and the Philippines are gradually increasing. Furthermore, if goods are provided to the Philippines through ODA, education to become proficient in operations and maintenance will prove essential to help the Philippines improve its capabilities. One of the greatest advantages of ODA is that, in the case of grants, funds can be given without any obligation to repay. Even in the case of ODA loans, the repayment period is long and interest rates are as close to interest-free as possible. Through such schemes, development cooperation for non-military purposes such as public welfare and disaster relief can be actively pursued, saving the limited budget of the Philippine government while contributing to improving the humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and maritime security capabilities of the AFP and Philippine coast guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2022, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. won the presidential election in the Philippines. Like his recent predecessors, Marcos will need to define the relationship with the United States, a treaty ally, and develop a strategy to manage China, which continues to challenge the status quo in the maritime domain. According to a survey of ASEAN countries published by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore in February 2022, 83.5 percent of Filipino respondents answered that they would choose the United States if the Philippines were forced to align with either the United States or China. This suggests an interest in furthering alliance ties with Washington, but in reality, for the Philippines and other countries in the region, this involves the maintenance of a delicate balancing act between the two great powers. It is also possible that Marcos could pursue outreach with China just as Duterte did at the onset of his administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and the United States have introduced strategies to maintain regional stability and prosperity by realizing a Free and Open Indo-Pacific, and enhancing cooperation with Southeast Asian partners such as the Philippines is critically important to those efforts. Japan has a long history of engagement with the Philippines rooted in economic cooperation, but gradually expanding to include defense cooperation and capacity building is critical to managing an increasingly complex regional security environment marked by increased Chinese assertiveness in the maritime domain. Japan should further develop its security partnership with the Philippines to reflect its geopolitical importance and address its security vulnerabilities in coordination with the United States and other regional partners. Experts in Japan and the United States have addressed the importance of engagement with the Philippines in geostrategic terms but with less consideration of what exactly should be done. This paper details ways to sustain momentum for bilateral security cooperation between Japan and the Philippines as a step toward multilateral security cooperation with the United States or Australia in the future. There should be no doubt that strengthening security cooperation between Japan and the Philippines, a process over 10 years in the making, will enhance deterrence in the region and contribute to the future development and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

Planners for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) started to talk about integrating digital technologies and to debate strategy, tactics, and operations in ways that drew on lessons from the Gulf War. PLA learning, debate, assimilation, and adaptation has continued over these subsequent decades — up to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Feigenbaum:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Talk to us a little bit about how we should think about the role of learning in the Chinese armed forces. How important are foreign military engagements, doctrines, conflicts for them?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Hooper:&lt;/strong&gt; The PLA are careful and meticulous students of modern warfare, particularly the U.S. way of war. They are voracious consumers of publicly available information, as well as all of the information that their very aggressive intelligence efforts provide them. When I was the defense attaché at [Pacific Command] and in the Office of [the] Secretary of Defense, I used to say, “If it’s online, they’ve read it.” And I remember being in meetings where they would quote word for word any doctrine that we had posted online, or revisions to our doctrine, as well as the performance capabilities of U.S. weapon systems. . . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite recent organizational reform efforts, the PLA remains essentially a political entity with a war-fighting mission. It is a party army, not a national army. And its approach to learning and leadership is heavily influenced by its own organization, as well as traditional Chinese culture and education. For example, one of the principal elements of the initial Russian military failures in Ukraine is a function of command and control, poor leadership development, internal corruption, inadequate training, and poor troop motivations. In the PLA system, development of these key capabilities is a Communist Party — not a strictly military — responsibility. And [Chinese President] Xi Jinping himself has acknowledged this. So the question becomes, and this is a historical issue with the PLA, how will the party address these military shortcomings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Feigenbaum:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China is a Leninist system. Decisionmaking is centralized, but there is debate in the system. And historically within the PLA, there’s been debate in which some views prevail, and some views end up getting eclipsed, sometimes for political reasons, sometimes for operational reasons. . . . Are there views in the PLA that have basically become obsolete in the last five to ten years because of things that they have observed in foreign military situations?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Hooper:&lt;/strong&gt; There are two things that have fundamentally changed over the past forty years. The first of those is this concept among the PLA leadership that they had the advantage of defense in depth, and as a result, they didn’t necessarily need to develop even a limited power projection capability. I can remember years ago PLA generals telling me, “Well, if you attack Tianjin, we’ll fall back to Beijing. And if you attack Beijing, we’ll fall back to Chengdu.” And I remember thinking, “Why in the world would we do that?” That’s fundamentally changed. We see their defense modernization focused on giving them the ability to have a limited power projection capability, if only for anti-access area denial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second [fundamental change] is the concept that they have an overwhelming advantage in mass. But qualitative quantity has an even higher quality all its own. So there’s been an abandonment of this perception that [the PLA] have this overwhelming advantage in mass that’s sufficient to deter an enemy from attacking, and more of an emphasis on reducing the size of the PLA ground forces and increasing the quality of the strategic rocket forces and the support forces in the Navy, in an effort to ensure that their quality matches the qualitative advantage that the United States has always enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Feigenbaum:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[Russian President] Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine on February 24. China, as we all know, has spent a couple of decades thinking about ways to coerce Taiwan. What’s happened since the 24th that might be relevant to Taiwan?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Hooper:&lt;/strong&gt; I think at the very strategic military level, one of the most fundamental tenets of PLA modernization has actually been validated by the Ukraine conflict, but it’s also paradoxical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of warfare never changes — the applications and violence to achieve a political end — but the character of warfare is constantly evolving. And that’s what we’re seeing now: an evolution of the character of warfare toward the defense, as opposed to the offense. The defense or the defending nation has an advantage here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia clearly possessed an overwhelming advantage in combat power and just sheer throw weight when compared to Ukraine. But despite this, Ukraine has been able to offset this advantage by a skillful application of asymmetric military capabilities that have been supplied by its allies and partners. Now, what we need to understand is the PLA has always perceived themselves to be the defender and the United States to be the aggressor. We tend to look at it [through] the Taiwan element of it — as China being the aggressor and us being the defender — but that’s not how they see it. And indeed, their entire defense modernization emphasis . . . has been specifically focused on denying the United States the ability to project power into the Western Pacific and to prevent [it] from building “mountains of iron.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we go to war anywhere in the world, we build a mountain of iron — in Kuwait, in Iraq, and in other places. And then we unleash this mountain of iron on whoever our foe is far from our shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paradox here is that while the United States is clearly the aggressor and attacker, within this paradigm, Taiwan is clearly the defender. And the Ukraine conflict has demonstrated that a well-supplied, well-motivated defender can effectively disrupt or even defeat a clearly superior adversary. If nothing else, this defender can significantly increase the cost and length and duration of a military conflict to the detriment of the attacker. So, when you look at the overall lesson here, it’s the fact that this is far more complex than they might have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Feigenbaum:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Is there anything [the PLA has] done that they should feel better about as a result of what’s happened to the Russians in Ukraine?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Hooper:&lt;/strong&gt; Let me talk first about noncommissioned officer [NCO] corps — the issue of cultural evolution of a military force. Because what a lot of people don’t understand about leadership, battle command, and NCO corps is that the essence of the strength of these capabilities is cultural, not technical. It is the willingness of the senior officer to delegate authority and to accept the counsel of a subordinate in their command over their own judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, as a general, I had a sergeant major. If I propose to do something and he says, “Sir, that’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard,” I have two choices. I can get angry about it or feel as if I’ve lost face, or I can modify my plans based upon the wise counsel that he’s given. In the U.S. system, I gain in stature with my forces by doing that. In some other cultures, that would produce a loss of face and a challenge to authority that could not be countenanced. That’s why you can form an NCO corps, but it may not be as effective in a Russian or a Chinese cultural context as it is in the U.S. context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing I’d raise is this issue of battle command. Russian officers keep getting killed because they don’t trust their junior subordinates to give them an accurate picture of the battlefield. They’re being hounded by Moscow to [share] what’s going on, and they only trust their own judgment. The success of [breaking up larger formations into smaller ones] is predicated on active, adaptive combat leaders who are willing to use their own initiative during the rapid evolution of combat operations. To illustrate that, we have a saying in the U.S. military that fundamentally describes the cultural difference between the Chinese and Russian militaries and the U.S. military. And every military officer learns it from the very beginning of his training: It’s easier to beg for forgiveness than ask for permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[U.S. military officers] learn to use and trust their own judgment in a rapidly evolving combat situation and explain their actions later on. And they anticipate that their leadership will support their actions, particularly if there’s a favorable outcome. And these types of cultural tenets are not necessarily common to either Russian military culture or Chinese culture. Those types of capabilities are absolutely essential to the success in information warfare– and hybrid warfare–based environments. And as we see in the Russian military, they simply don’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Feigenbaum:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There are two questions from audience members that get at that question of false conclusions and false analogies: What are the risks attached to over-comparing Ukraine to Taiwan? Given that the Chinese Communist Party and the PLA have their own perspectives, what are the wrong or inaccurate lessons they may be drawing from the Ukraine conflict?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Hooper:&lt;/strong&gt; Two quick points. Number one: I think one of the flawed analogies here is if we do all of the things that the Russians didn’t do, we will be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is something that I’ve not seen a lot of people talk about: the complete failure of strategic deterrent signaling and the reading of deterrence signaling on the part of both Russia and the United States as a prelude to the Ukrainian conflict. I was rereading John Toland’s The Rising Sun about the rise and fall of the Japanese Empire, and I was struck by the failure of strategic deterrence signaling between the United States and Japan before Pearl Harbor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw a similar failure of strategic deterrent signaling between the United States and Russia and between NATO and Russia. Prior to the Ukrainian conflict, both sides seemed to misread signals. And I think that there should be some study given to the strategic signaling that could take place prior to Chinese military operations against Taiwan or against the United States, so that we have a much clearer understanding of what they are saying, which might both precede the conflict and hopefully help to avoid the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Feigenbaum:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Does that mean we’re headed for trouble?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Hooper:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s exactly what I mean by a failure of deterrent communication. We are talking past each other. We’re not really listening to each other, and we’re not considering the messages that are being sent in the context of our opposite number, as opposed to our own context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Feigenbaum:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[What are your] headline takeaways from what you’ve observed since February?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Hooper:&lt;/strong&gt; There are no regional conflicts in the twenty-first century involving great powers. The Ukraine-Russia conflict has caused food shortages in Tunisia and vegetable oil shortages in Indonesia, and rising oil prices. If we think the global implications of a Russia-Ukraine conflict are significant, wait until you see the global implications of a China-U.S. conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Haenle:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In your view, what are the main policy continuities from the last administration? What do you think are the strengths of Biden’s China policy and Asia policy, and where do you think the administration needs to step up its game?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Medeiros:&lt;/strong&gt; We can start with comparisons between this administration and the last administration. I think the [current] administration gets a bad rap as “Trump lite.” I just think that is an unfair criticism because, sure there are similarities and differences, but the differences, to me, are big, important, sort of chunky differences between the Biden approach and the Trump approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, it is important to remember that Biden, from day one, basically said that they are not interested in changing China. So they took regime-change off the table, which is something the Trump administration very specifically embraced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number two, the Trump administration wasn’t really interested in working with allies and partners. That literally is the centerpiece of what Biden is doing in terms of his China strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number three, the Trump team, through their tariffs and other economic measures, was pretty committed to a very robust economic decoupling. That’s not where the Biden administration is. I think the Biden administration realizes there needs to be a judicious and smart approach to economic interdependence to reduce those areas of national security risk and vulnerability, but that trade and investment serves the interests of American businesses, workers, and consumers. The Trump administration didn’t really believe in dialogue. They said dialogue was just a waste of time, and they didn’t really believe in cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Haenle:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Only in the trade space, the negotiations on trade, that was the only dialogue the Trump administration had up and running.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Medeiros:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s right. And I think the Biden team has shown they’re pretty different. They believe in high-level dialogue. My favorite fun fact of the day is that the administration has been in place for sixteen months, and Biden and [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] have now talked with each other four times. So that’s basically a high-level meeting every four months. That’s pretty good. Of course, [National Security Adviser] Jake Sullivan met with [China’s senior diplomat] Yang Jiechi in Luxemburg just this week. So clearly, they believe in high-level dialogue, and they’re doing good things with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Jake Sullivan met with Yang Jiechi in Rome, and then three days later, President Biden met with President Xi. These high-level dialogues helped the administration succeed in effectively putting a cap on the Russia-China relationship: no military cooperation and sanctions compliance. That is a really serious piece of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, they believe in dialogue, they have demonstrated they can achieve strategic results with that dialogue. The other piece is: they don’t like to talk about this dialogue and the successes from it. They should talk more about it. There is actually limited and episodic cooperation: students are flowing back and forth, the administration last year used very high-level diplomacy to get the Chinese to participate in a coordinated release of the strategic petroleum reserve, the Chinese are still playing ball with the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] on Iran. I don’t want to overdo the cooperation point, because the Chinese are not really in the mood to cooperate, but the Biden administration basically said, “Theoretically, when it’s in our interest, we are ready to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I give [Secretary of State] Tony Blinken very substantial credit for laying out four baskets in his speech where he could cooperate. And look, those are all politically sensitive issues where he is subject to vulnerability. But my broader point is, where there are differences between Biden and Trump, there are pretty fundamental, chunky, important differences. That’s why I think Biden’s policy is not Trump lite — it’s Biden plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Haenle:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Given China’s latest declarations and pronouncements regarding territorial waters and military activities outside of Chinese territory and recent actions to intercept Australian aviation activity, is it not inevitable that some form of military conflict will occur between the United States and China?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Medeiros:&lt;/strong&gt; I am very concerned about the Taiwan issue. I see a lot of loose talk, including on the U.S. side. I think the United States needs to say less and do more, with a greater focus on deterrence and less commentary and discussion about actual U.S. policy, which is muddying the waters. I see hardening positions on all sides, especially in mainland China. I see growing military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re about to enter into a transition period as Taiwan prepares for its January 2024 election. . . . I worry less about the outbreak of armed conflict — an actual amphibious assault on the part of the People’s Republic of China. What I worry about is a convergence of trends that could precipitate a fourth Taiwan Strait crisis. I am concerned that if Beijing becomes sufficiently frustrated [or] anxious that it [will] decide to throw the equivalent of a strategic brushback pitch against Taiwan. It could do something that tries to convince Taiwan and the United States to stop changing the status quo according to Beijing. We could be on a dangerous trajectory because of growing anxieties, concerns, [and] changes in intentions and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement a few weeks ago that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was going to travel to Taiwan created a lot of concern. If that trip had gone forward, it could have been very destabilizing. We need to be aware of actions like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Haenle:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There’s a lot of interest in Biden’s statements on Taiwan. Three times, in response to questions, he said the United States would get involved militarily to defend Taiwan. The White House then has to roll that back and say that U.S. policy has not changed. Politicians on both sides of the aisle are coming out saying that this is a great development because we need strategic clarity. We need Beijing to know what we will do should something happen. In your view, would a less ambiguous Taiwan policy exacerbate tensions?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan Medeiros:&lt;/strong&gt; We are where we are today [because] the president of the United States has made these statements three or four times, depending on how you count. And I think that’s created an environment of some confusion about the nature of U.S. policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to tread really, really carefully. Doing things like monkeying around with the components of our One China policy on the State Department website creates all sorts of confusion, increases anxieties, and makes it harder to deter mainland China. The focus needs to be on deterring Beijing. It is going to be really hard to deter mainland China if they think we’re trying to move from a One China policy to a One China, One Taiwan policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People forget that our One China policy has many components to it. A big one is the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) . . . . The preamble of the TRA says very clearly that an action to try to coerce Taiwan militarily will be seen as a grave threat to peace and stability in the western Pacific. That’s pretty explicit. We should just use that language in the TRA and remind Chinese officials about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recruiting for some volunteer battalions began in June but has intensified in July, with new volunteer units being reported daily. The battalions apparently will consist of roughly 400 men each aged between 18 and 60. They will belong to various branches of service including motorized rifle, tank, and naval infantry, but also signals and logistics. Recruits are not required to have prior military service and will undergo only 30 days of training before deployment to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This recruitment effort will likely be expensive if it comes close to meeting its targets.&lt;/strong&gt; It appears that the Russian Ministry of Defense will pay the volunteers’ salaries while the “federal subjects” will pay their enlistment bonuses. Salaries generally start at roughly $3,000 per month per soldier or about $1.2 million per month per 400-man unit. Enlistment bonuses offered by at least some units appear to be roughly a month’s salary. If the effort generates 85 battalions each of 400 men it would bring an additional 34,000 volunteers into the fight at the cost of about $102 million per month in salary alone. Considering that the 30 days of training the volunteers will receive before entering combat will not produce combat-ready soldiers, that price is very high. The volunteers will receive veteran status and benefits if they serve in Ukraine, moreover, in addition to their salaries and bonuses, a commitment that will add to the Russian Federation budget for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This drive will likely produce “soldiers” of lower quality than the normal conscripts in the Russian army at close to professional-soldier prices.&lt;/strong&gt; It is a remarkable expedient that suggests that Russian President Vladimir Putin remains unwilling to compel his people to fight and unable to attract them to fight voluntarily without considerable incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;primorsky-krai&quot;&gt;Primorsky Krai&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Tigr” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt; (Naval Infantry, part of 155th Separate Naval Infantry Brigade): Russian outlets reported that “Tigr” is recruiting volunteers with or without military experience ages 18 to 60, on July 9, but it is unclear when the recruitment drive begun in Primorsky Krai. The governor of Primorsky Krai reported that the battalion is enrolling only residents of the krai and has the highest number of registered volunteers of any federal subject in Russia. “Tigr“ will undergo a 30-day, two-stage training period with officers of the 155th Separate Naval Infantry Brigade at the Bamburovo and Gornostay Training Grounds and will replenish the naval infantry brigade. Social media videos show that some servicemen are already exercising at an unspecified training ground, but it is unclear if ”Tigr” has formally deployed for its 30-day training period. Distinguished servicemen in the unit will receive a 50,000-ruble bonus ($860) after two weeks of training, and all servicemen will receive a 150,000-ruble payment ($2,575) after completing the training. Funds will be drawn from the Primorsky Krai budget. “Tigr” servicemen will receive a monthly salary of 200,000 rubles ($3,430) and veteran status. Social media users noted that footage of the “Tigr” battalion shows that the recruits are older than traditional military age and are likely in their 50s to 60s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kursk-oblast&quot;&gt;Kursk Oblast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Seym” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt; (logistics): The “Seym” Battalion is a volunteer logistical support battalion that began recruiting volunteers on July 11. The Kursk Oblast Administration announced that the battalion will focus on transporting fuel, food, ammunition, with servicemen up to 60 years of age receiving monthly salaries of 200,000 to 500,000 rubles ($3,430 to $8,580) depending on the time spent at the frontlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;moscow-city&quot;&gt;Moscow City&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Sobyanskiy Polk” Regiment&lt;/strong&gt;: Moscow officials began recruitment for the newly-established “Sobyanskiy Polk” regiment on July 1 and are offering over 200,000 rubles per month (approximately $3,400) to volunteers drawn from the Moscow City budget. Russian opposition outlet Meduza noted that most of the volunteers came from regions other than Moscow City as of July 13. Meduza stated that former commander of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) Militia Roman Vysotsky is one of the recruiters for “Sobyanskiy Polk,” but it is unclear if the regiment will merge with DNR forces. The “Sobyanskiy Polk” volunteers (up to 60 years of age) will undergo training at the Mulino Training Ground in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast before deploying to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;republic-of-tatarstan&quot;&gt;Republic of Tatarstan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Alga” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: The Republic of Tatarstan created a joint Telegram channel to recruit for the “Alga” and “Timer” Battalions on June 23, but had likely already begun the recruitment drive as the unit reportedly had 300 registered volunteers on June 24. The official recruitment channel claimed that the republic had recruited over 500 volunteers for the “Alga” Battalion on July 1even though the original recruitment target had been 400. The Republic of Tatarstan dispatched the “Alga” volunteer battalion for a month-long training program in Orenburg Oblast on July 8. The battalion will then deploy to Nizhny Novgorod Oblast where they will receive their combat assignments before entering Ukraine. The Republic of Tatarstan will pay servicemen 3,000 rubles (approximately $53) per day in addition to a one-time 260,000 ruble payment (approximately $4,450) for enlisting drawn from the republic’s budget. Republic of Tatarstan also offered an additional 8,000 rubles (approximately $140) per day spent in combat, but it is unclear if the Republic or Russian Defense Ministry will sponsor the payment. The Russian Defense Ministry will reportedly pay servicemen a starting monthly salary of 150,000 rubles (approximately $2,600).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Timer” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: The Republic of Tatarstan is forming the “Timer” Battalion as of July 1, and 300 to 350 men had already passed the selection process by that date. The battalion will reportedly have over 400 volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;orenburg&quot;&gt;Orenburg&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Yaik” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt; (motorized rifle battalion): Orenburg City officials announced the establishment of the “Yaik” volunteer motorized rifle battalion on July 8. Any Orenburg Oblast men ages 18 to 50 can enlist, and a military commission will certify the health and clean criminal record of volunteers. Servicemen will receive a salary of 200,000 rubles ($3,430) for serving in Donbas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nizhny-novgorod-oblast&quot;&gt;Nizhny Novgorod Oblast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Kuzma Minin” Tank Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: Nizhny Novgorod Oblast announced the formation of the “Kuzma Minin” Tank Battalion on July 1 via the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast Russian Union of Afghan Veterans. The battalion is recruiting men ages 20 to 50 for a six-month contract. Nizhny Novgorod Oblast offers 200,000 ruble ($3,430) one-time payment upon signing the contract and a 220,000 to 350,000 ruble monthly salary ($3,775 to $6,000). Nizhny Novgorod Oblast offers volunteers veteran status, unspecified military training, and a full social package for the serviceman and his family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;krasnoyarsk-krai&quot;&gt;Krasnoyarsk Krai&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unknown&lt;/strong&gt; - Ukraine’s Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) obtained a document stating that Krasnoyarsk Krai allocated 120 million rubles (approximately two million dollars) to recruit 400 servicemen from the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;republic-of-chechnya&quot;&gt;Republic of Chechnya&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Vostok Akhmat” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov announced on June 29 that Chechen officials successfully formed the “Vostok Akhmat” Battalion that will shortly move to a permanent base. Kadyrov also reported that the Chechen Republic is building new bases and military facilities for servicemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Zapad Akhmat” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov announced on June 26 that Chechen forces formed a West-Akhmat battalion “in the shortest possible” time and claimed that the unit would deploy to a well-equipped base in Chechnya. The unit is subordinate to the Russian Southern Military District. Its commander is Islaim Aguev.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Yug Akhmat” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov announced the formation of “Yug Akhmat” on June 26, but did not provide any additional details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Sever Akhmat” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov announced the formation of “Sever Akhmat” on June 26, but did not provide any additional details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;republic-of-bashkortostan&quot;&gt;Republic of Bashkortostan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Shaimuratov” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: The Russian organization “Veterans of the Marine Corps and Special Forces of the Navy” announced the creation of the battalion at the end of May and noted that servicemen will receive a month of training in Orenburg Oblast before deploying to Ukraine. Some pro-Kremlin media outlets announced the deployment of a new volunteer battalion from the Republic of Bashkortostan to Donbas on July 6, while some sources claimed that the battalion arrived in Orenburg for training. The battalion had reportedly arrived in Alkino, Republic of Bashkortostan, on July 2. The Republic of Bashkortostan recruitment Telegram channel reported that the ”Shaimuratov” Battalion had registered 250 volunteers as of June 16 and is seeking to recruit a total of 800 volunteers split between two battalions. The Republic of Bashkortostan and the Russian Defense Ministry financially incentivized servicemen by offering 200,000 rubles ($3,430) for signing the military contract and 2,000 rubles ($34) for every day served, but it is unclear whether this payment refers to service in a combat zone. Volunteers will reportedly receive monthly salaries of 220,000 rubles ($3,775).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Alexander Dostavalov” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: A local Ural region outlet reported that the “Alexander Dostavalov” Battalion is deploying to a place of unit coordination in Ilishevsky District, Republic of Bashkortostan, on July 14. The battalion began recruitment prior to June 25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;perm-oblast&quot;&gt;Perm Oblast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Parma” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: Perm Oblast officials announced a recruitment campaign for the “Parma” battalion on May 25. The recruitment campaign offered volunteers a 300,000-ruble monthly salary ($5,150), federal housing, higher education grants, and social benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Molot” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: Perm Oblast officials stated that they are continuing recruitment for the “Molot” Battalion as of July 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chelyabinsk-oblast&quot;&gt;Chelyabinsk Oblast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Uzhnouralets” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: Governor of Chelyabinsk Oblast Alexei Teksler announced on July 13 that the region has been forming two battalions as part of the Central Military District: “Uzhnouralets” and “Uzhnyi Ural. The region held a departure ceremony for 82 servicemen of the battalion that deployed to the training ground in Nizhny Norgorod on July 15. First Deputy Regional Minister of Public Security Vladimir Gusak said that ”Uzhnouralets” has in total 263 volunteers, including the recently deployed servicemen. Local news reports said that the youngest serviceman is 21 and the oldest 54.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Uzhnyi Ural” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: First Deputy Regional Minister of Public Security Vladimir Gusak said that “Uzhnyi Ural” had recruited 251 volunteers as of July 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;republic-of-chuvashia&quot;&gt;Republic of Chuvashia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Atal” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt; (Signals): Republic of Chuvashia Head Oleg Nikolaev said that the Republic is currently forming the “Atal” Battalion as of July 11. Nikolaev said that volunteers will receive a ”lump-sum cash payment” of 200,000 rubles ($3,775) when enlisting into the unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;republic-of-north-ossetiaalania&quot;&gt;Republic of North Ossetia–Alania&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Alania” Battalion&lt;/strong&gt;: The Alania Battalion is the first Russian volunteer battalion that ISW observed operating in Ukraine in 2022. Alan Valerievich Mamiev – a Russian combatant who fought in the Donetsk People’s Republic’s “Vostok” Battalion in Donbas in 2014 – announced the formation of the Alania Battalion in January 2016. The payment, benefits, and deployment terms promised to Alania Battalion fighters to fight in Ukraine in 2022 are unclear. The Alania Battalion deployed to Ukraine likely around late May or early June 2022 and participated in combat operations on the southern axis in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Head of the Republic of North Ossetia Sergei Menyailo visited the Alania Battalion and reportedly received a concussion near Hulaipole. A unspecified T-62 tank unit (likely a platoon-sized tank unit) reinforced the Alania Battalion on June 20. Combat imagery from early July documented the Alania Battalion’s loss of at least one of the tanks that reinforced the battalion.&lt;/p&gt;

Or, to put it in the simpler words of Jim Malone, Eliot Ness’s counselor in The Untouchables, “You wanna know how to get Capone? They pull a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That’s the Chicago way! And that’s how you get Capone.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Al Capone is an apt analogy for what the West confronts in Russia: a particularly noxious mix of Mafia mentality, hypernationalist ideology, and totalitarian technique. Elegance is not the Russian way, and it cannot be our way. This is the light in which one should measure the accomplishments of NATO’s recent gathering in Madrid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tangible efforts that Western leaders announced were impressive in many respects, particularly the commitments to provide Ukraine with nearly 500 artillery systems, 600 tanks, hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition, and more. The question, as always, is whether these will be delivered as swiftly as they can be absorbed, and whether the United States and its allies are “leading the target” by putting in place now the infrastructure to prepare Ukraine for the weapons it will require and hopefully receive one, two, or six months from now, and for training the large forces it must mobilize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2022/06/photos-more-than-100-days-of-war-in-ukraine/661217/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read: More than 100 days of war in Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States made some incremental additional commitments of forces to Europe, including two destroyers for a naval base in Spain. The policy declarations were important as well: a decision to expand by an order of magnitude NATO’s high-readiness forces; a formal recognition of the challenge (NATO avoided for now the word threat) posed by China; and an agreement to welcome Finnish and Swedish applications to join the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these moves, beneficial as they may be, only partly meet the needs of the moment. Time and again Ukraine has demonstrated its ability to absorb high-end military hardware and deploy it quickly and effectively. This seems to be the case with HIMARS, the mobile rocket systems that are extremely accurate, and with which Ukrainian forces seem to be already hitting Russian ammunition dumps and military headquarters. Instead of the promised eight, the Ukrainians need 80, and work should be happening now to scale up transfers of these and like weapons as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the Biden administration still struggles with is the ultimate purpose of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/ukraine-western-support-concession-economic-cost/661155/&quot;&gt;Western assistance to Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. At his press conference, the president said that the United States and its allies would not “allow Ukraine to be defeated.” That is the wrong objective. It should be, rather, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/why-ukraine-must-defeat-putin-russia/629940/&quot;&gt;ensure Russia’s defeat&lt;/a&gt; — the thwarting of its aims to conquer yet more of Ukrainian territory, the smashing of its armed forces, and the doing of both in a convincing, public, and, yes, therefore humiliating way. Chicago rules, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way, the administration is wrong to titrate arms out of a misguided desire to avoid provoking Russian escalation or enabling the Ukrainians to do too much. The West is in a moment of military-industrial crisis; it should be taking concrete measures to ramp up industrial mobilization, with the goal of equipping Ukraine to the maximum while rearming the expanding forces of a newly awakened NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as Western allies counter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/category/russias-invasion-ukraine/&quot;&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, they must also meet the broader and longer-term threat that Russia poses to the eastern members of NATO, particularly the Baltic states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Western allies will not invade Russia, nor will they overthrow its regime directly — one day, hopefully, Russians will do that. Putin is motivated by imperial fantasies of imitating Peter the Great and other, even less savory Russian leaders. And Putin’s successor, should the Russian leader die or become incapacitated while in office, will likely be no better. For evidence of that, one need only consult the ravings of key advisers such as Nikolai Patrushev. If and when the battles cease in Ukraine, Russia’s intentions to expand and subjugate its neighbors will remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news here is that if one sets aside misleading memories of World War II and the Cold War, and disregards the ominous mutterings of experts who exaggerated Russian capacity before the war, then it becomes obvious that Russia is a weak state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s GDP is less than that of South Korea. Its leadership is afraid to openly mobilize its middle class, so it refuses to declare war and send young men from Moscow and St. Petersburg to the slaughterhouse that is the Donbas. Its generals are, for the most part, incompetent, which is why purges of them continue. It is scraping the bottom of its manpower barrel and so raises to absurd heights the age level of potential service members. Corruption and indiscipline have rotted out its maintenance and low-level leadership. What it has is Cold War–era stockpiles of weapons and munitions (and those are huge, but finite); some pockets of excellence, for example its railroad units; and utter disregard for human life throughout the chain of command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, a mangy, myopic, and rabid bear is still a dangerous beast. That’s why beating Russian forces in Ukraine is not enough. The West must impose upon Russia sanctions intended not, as the current ones are, to punish, but rather to enfeeble (Chicago rules, again). The plummeting of Russian car production is an example of a basic fact, which is that Russian production depends, more than one might think, on access to Western chips, machine tools, and special materials. However the Ukraine war ends, permanently or temporarily, the West needs to settle into a comprehensive sanctions regime that will weaken Russia’s economy in the long haul and throttle its ability to rearm on a large scale when the shooting stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO expansion should assist in this process. The alliance will soon in all likelihood have Sweden and Finland as full members. They have real and potential capacity (Finland more the former, Sweden more the latter) and serious political leadership. But a NATO of 32 members will be even more unwieldy than what we now have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/07/nato-europe-america-trump-strategy/661459/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read: The accidental Trumpification of NATO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution — which cannot be publicly declared — is a NATO-within-NATO. Germany, France, and Italy have the largest economies in the European Union and in theory should carry the most weight in European-security decision making as well. But they cannot. Germany, the proverbial Hamlet of nations, is fatally compromised by its unwillingness and inability to make good on military commitments, and its recent sordid past in enabling Russia’s growth and stranglehold on European energy supplies. France is domestically torn, while the overweening vanity of its presidents makes it difficult for them to get a receptive hearing from lesser mortals. Italy, as ever, produces statesmen on occasion, but not statesmanship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nascent coalition of powers is, however, willing to take Russia seriously and has the muscle to thwart her while bringing less resolute European states along. The Eastern European and Baltic states, with Poland in the lead, know Russian tyranny firsthand, and are ready to stand up to it; the Scandinavian states, in particular Finland and Norway, are almost as intent; the English-speaking external powers, including the United Kingdom and Canada, are similarly alive and determined. It is to this core group that American statecraft must look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British chief of the General Staff recently described the Ukraine crisis as a 1937 moment for the West. It was an acute historical comparison. In that year the Sino-Japanese war began, setting the stage for World War II. In that year the West had before it choices that could have avoided the horrors of a far worse conflict, but it ducked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To their credit, in the current moment, Western leaders are performing far better than did their counterparts 85 years ago — but not yet well enough. We’re dealing with Capone, and while, like Eliot Ness, we need to stay within the constraints of law and basic decency, we also need to apply Chicago rules.&lt;/p&gt;

At present, however, several Russian advantages and Ukrainian weaknesses are leading to an attritional conflict that risks a protracted war, eventually favouring Russia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian electronic warfare (EW) is denying Ukraine a sufficiently fast kill chain to destroy Russia’s artillery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian artillery is fixing the Ukrainian military and preventing the Ukrainians from concentrating to undertake offensive manoeuvre.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian cruise missiles are imposing a high economic and political cost on Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A shortage of skilled infantry and armoured operators is limiting Ukraine’s offensive combat power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limited staff capacity is limiting Ukraine’s ability to plan and execute combined operations at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s international partners have the ability to reverse these dynamics to enable Ukraine to retake its lost territory. This cannot be achieved through the piecemeal delivery of a large number of different fleets of equipment, each with separate training, maintenance and logistical needs. Instead, Ukraine’s partners should rationalise the support they provide around a small number of platforms. Ukraine’s key capability requirements are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anti-radiation seekers for loitering munitions to suppress or destroy Russian EW complexes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to target and destroy Russian logistics and ammunition stockpiles to starve Russian artillery of ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;155-mm howitzers and ammunition to prevent Russian troop concentration and support Ukrainian troop concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secure communications systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anti-tank guided weapons and man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protected mobility to enable Ukrainian troops to manoeuvre under artillery threat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Point defences to protect critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also necessary for Ukraine to receive training at scale to form new units able to undertake offensive operations and to receive staff and junior leadership training to support the orchestration of combined arms offensive manoeuvre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four months of intense fighting in Ukraine have seen Russia’s grand offensive strokes descend into a grinding attritional struggle. Ukraine’s determination to resist, flawed Russian planning and execution, and the rapid delivery of arms to the Ukrainian armed forces have ensured Kyiv’s survival. The support that has enabled Ukraine to survive, however, will not deliver an end to the conflict. Russia could still wear down Ukrainian ammunition stockpiles, its reserve of skilled troops and the patience of the international community to slowly claw back a path towards meeting its aims. Ensuring Ukrainian survival in the longer term means enabling Ukrainian victory, and this requires a different kind of support to its forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International support to Ukraine over the first four months of the war has been driven by two imperatives: what Ukraine’s partners have had immediately available; and what can be brought into Ukrainian service with the minimum necessary training and enablement. Given the magnitude and acuteness of the threat, this approach was justified. As the war protracts, however, there is a need to ensure that Ukraine’s war effort can be sustained, and that Ukraine is armed to deconstruct Russia’s system of systems, rather than produce a symmetrical stalemate that can only bring about an attritional conflict, risking Ukraine’s exhaustion. Whatever capabilities are provided, it is also necessary for standardisation and for them to be provided at scale. Given that this will require orders from Western industry, it is essential that the right capabilities are prioritised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report seeks to outline how Russian forces are conducting their war against Ukraine through the examination of their technical capabilities and how they are being employed against the Ukrainian armed forces. By examining the tactical performance of the Russian system of warfare, the report reaches conclusions as to what international support is best placed to achieve disproportionate effect against it. The report is based on fieldwork in Ukraine both prior to and during the conflict, extensive interviews with Ukrainian military, scientific, security and intelligence personnel in both leadership and tactical positions, physical examination of captured Russian military equipment, observation of the armed forces of Ukraine on operations, interviews with Western security and military personnel, interviews with fighters in Ukraine’s foreign legion, examination of Russian military documents assessing their own operations and tactics in Ukraine, and the scraping of videos, images and accounts of fighting from open sources alongside a literature review of press coverage and academic writing about the war. The report takes into consideration, but largely discounts, Russian military performance and especially tactics, techniques and procedures documented during the first three weeks of fighting because the operational context makes these anomalous. To avoid similar contextual factors leading to overly broad conclusions, the report seeks to document consistent Russian behaviours and proficiencies observed between multiple fronts, such as in Donbas, Kherson and in some areas around Kyiv. It neglects a detailed examination of Russian unconventional operations and Ukraine’s maritime flank. These are important topics that should be examined separately. Instead, this report focuses on the dynamics of ground operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structurally, the report focuses on four elements of Russian operations: artillery; EW and reconnaissance; ground manoeuvre; and the air war. It ends with an overview of the conclusions as to what support should be prioritised for Ukraine. Although the report is heavily based on assessments of Ukrainian military performance and deficiencies in the Ukrainian armed forces, these are detailed sparingly to avoid providing Russia with useful insight into Ukrainian capabilities and vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beneath-the-iron-rain&quot;&gt;Beneath the Iron Rain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artillery is one of the most important components of Russian operations, and in terms of lethal capabilities it has become Russia’s mission-critical force multiplier. The generally mediocre performance of Russia’s ground forces has been increasingly offset by their leveraging of massed artillery fires to facilitate a slow and methodical advance. Sustained bombardment has progressively displaced the local population and levelled the settlements and infrastructure that were being defended, forcing the Ukrainian military to abandon territory after it is devastated. Furthermore, by preventing Ukrainian forces from massing to counterattack and causing considerable attrition to those units holding the line, particularly in Sievierodonetsk, Russian artillery was the key to preventing Ukrainian forces from turning the tables in the close fight as they did in the Battle for Kyiv prior to the Russian withdrawal from that axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early stages of the Battle for Kyiv, the battlefield geometry prevented Russian artillery from being employed effectively. Russian forces were trapped on two main supply routes, leaving their lead elements in range of Ukrainian artillery positions while their own artillery and its ammunition were trapped behind congested friendly forces. In the south and in Donbas, by contrast, Russian forces have been able to deploy their artillery units more effectively and in a manner more consistent with Russian doctrine. Despite this, Russian artillery use reflects the Russian military being in a transitionary state. It had yet to widely implement many of the doctrinal and technical innovations that it had experimented with in recent years and intended to employ at scale. While battalion tactical groups (BTGs) have their own organic artillery, mostly mortars and limited numbers of field howitzers,  many units lacked full complements of modernised guns, with most commanders unwilling to release artillery from the artillery tactical groups generated at the brigade and divisional level. This problem has been exacerbated by equipment losses early in the conflict, and has meant that Russian artillery has largely operated independently from – rather than in close support of – its manoeuvre elements, with supportive fire missions having long delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further challenge resulting from the disorganisation of the first phase of the war is that as Russian casualties have been replaced by conscripts, new short-term volunteer contractors, and mobilised citizens with prior military experience, there are fewer personnel trained to use Russia’s latest fire-control and battlespace management systems. In theory, Russian fires are mediated by the AKATSIA and AQUEDUCT systems. Russian forces were moving towards a common information environment as trialled at smaller scale in Syria. Under this concept of operations, which borrowed heavily from US and NATO concepts and doctrine and has been referred to as the Reconnaissance Fires Complex, artillery tactical groups could, through secure channels, receive targeting information in real time from ISTAR systems and units, be flexibly tasked to provide fire support to different units, and coordinate fires from multiple gunlines and groups to provide effect on targets. However, shortages of the required secure communications systems, alongside weaknesses in the training of both new recruits and older veterans called up to replace casualties and who are not familiar with the latest modernised systems, have resulted in failures to use it correctly. Russian artillery organic to BTGs have often communicated via unencrypted communications, or have followed up signals on their fire control systems with communications via cell phone or commercially procured devices. This has caused a centralisation of the artillery system into the artillery tactical groups under the command of more senior officers and staffs with experience of the appropriate battlespace management tools and in a slowing of the kill chain and resultant reduction in effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these frictions, Russia has achieved fires dominance through the sheer volume of tactical artillery and munitions that it can bring to bear. In addition to vast stockpiles that the Soviet Union accumulated, and which have yet to be depleted – by some estimates, several years’ worth still remains – the Russian defence industry has a significant capacity for producing artillery shells. For example, Soviet-era armaments factories based in Ukraine were fulfilling orders for Russian forces up until 2014 with the capacity to assemble 2,000,000 152-mm howitzer shells per year in contracts that had been continued since the 1980s. Many similar large-scale plants remain in operation inside Russia. Although the Ukrainian factory had the capacity to assemble this many shells, actual outputs were often slightly below this figure, largely because of a bottleneck in the production of explosive material for the propellant and warhead. Nevertheless, the result of this stockpile is that, at present, Russia is firing approximately 20,000 152-mm artillery shells per day compared with Ukraine’s 6,000, with an even greater proportional disparity in multiple rocket launchers and missiles fired. Despite the prevalence of examples in the social media narrative of precision fires being delivered, the majority of artillery fires in Ukraine are conducted by traditional unguided mortars, field howitzers and MLRS. Although guided artillery ammunition has been produced and made available to Russian units, personnel and training problems have hampered implementation. This has often resulted in guided munitions being used as dumb shells. Ukrainian troops have observed Russian forces firing laser-guided artillery ammunition, for example, without using a laser designator to mark targets. Similar to previous conflicts, area-effect artillery reliant on blast and fragmentation as the principal mechanisms for causing damage to targets is devastating against soft targets such as dismounted personnel and light vehicles but is of limited effectiveness against armour. Against armoured vehicles and hard targets or structures, the use of these fires tends to be to fix the defenders, which can make them susceptible to either bypass, or destruction through the employment of thermobaric artillery such as the TOS-1A MLRS. Due to poor ISTAR capability and long response times, Ukrainian artillery units have reported being able to consistently evade being subjected to effective Russian targeting and counterbattery fire. However, when employed en masse against fixed targets, such as defended positions and urban areas, the cumulative effect of Russian artillery has proven potent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way that tactical artillery has been employed is roughly consistent with established doctrine, albeit lacking much of the C4ISTAR coordination as envisioned by the Reconnaissance Fire Complex and exhibiting a considerable degree of systemic friction and slowed responsiveness. Where the Reconnaissance Fire Complex has been successfully established in Ukraine – which has occurred periodically – it has been through the adoption and integration of UAV and EW ISTAR to identify targets and coordinate fires. In terms of physical deployment, Ukrainian forces have observed that the Russians deploy their artillery systems set back from the frontline by one third of their maximum range as a protection measure; mortars are largely positioned 1.5 km back from the forward line of own troops, artillery tactical groups subordinated to brigades 8 km back, and artillery tactical groups armed with longer-ranged systems dedicated to deep fires at 10–15 km back. There is significant variation from these distances, with artillery units often moving forward to extend their reach. Nevertheless, the principle is generally adhered to. Batteries are deployed across an area of up to 100 by 300 metres, with between 20 and 40 metres between each gun. MLRS are generally deployed in a linear gunline, with up to 150 metres between each launcher. However, some artillery batteries have been detected as being split up into dispersed subunits. This is partly due to artillery shortages at the BTG and brigade level, with pairs of, or individual, guns fulfilling a support function that should be the task of a full battery. However, some of this dispersion is due to the use of mobile fire units supported by UAVs to attack key Ukrainian targets. While limited in scale, these instances show where the Russian Army’s aspirations to modernise have begun to be realised. Where they have been realised, Russian fires have been responsive, accurate and highly lethal. Russian artillery units have also set up dummy positions using one artillery piece with the remainder made up of damaged or destroyed Russian artillery, to draw Ukrainian fire. Russian MLRS are used primarily for area denial, often to constrain the movement of Ukrainian units, while field howitzers are used against specific targets, though this is not a universal rule. For counterbattery fire against artillery, Russian forces will generally task those artillery tactical groups armed with heavier,
longer-ranged weapons, or Tochka-U.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Ukrainian artillery crews, Russian artillery is generally able to bring accurate artillery fire down on targets 3 to 5 minutes after UAV reconnaissance has identified them, but if a target is identified with EW direction finding, acoustic reconnaissance or counterbattery artillery radar, it will take Russian artillery approximately half an hour to bring inaccurate artillery fire to bear. The importance of UAVs to Russia’s artillery precision and responsiveness has forced Ukraine to maintain organic MANPADS teams with their artillery, preferably armed with visually guided systems such as Starstreak and Martlet, which have proven much more effective against UAVs and helicopters. If Russian forces are able to maintain UAV reconnaissance over a target, they are able to adjust fire in near-real time even if the target is moving. When subjected to counterbattery fire themselves, Russian MLRS units will tend to relocate, whereas howitzers, whether towed or self-propelled, will usually be left in position while the crews seek cover or position themselves at a distance from their guns until incoming fire has subsided. Russian batteries often do not relocate after fire missions, but will relocate to a new position or gunline within the same approximate area if they come under attack. It was noted that when plugged into the AKATSIA fire-control architecture, Russian counterbattery fire was assigned to unengaged batteries, and was not conducted by batteries that were themselves being targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One significant deviation from doctrine is that Russian forces have made extensive tactical use of the Tochka-U ballistic missile for counterbattery and tactical strikes. Although almost entirely retired from frontline service by 2019, as they were officially replaced by Iskander-M, the reliance of Russian forces on indirect fires resulted in the Tochka-U’s restoration to active service and its repurposing from a long-range precision-strike system to part of the tactical artillery system. Although Tochka-U is often used by Russian forces to target EW units and command posts located in the enemy rear, it has become valued for its large high-explosive warhead, which Russian forces seem to view as effective against a wide variety of targets for which it was not originally intended. This has sometimes manifested in acutely inefficient targeting. In one engagement, a single Ukrainian M109 howitzer was targeted by three Tochka-U strikes. The crew were forced to temporarily abandon the howitzer in order to seek hard cover, but it survived with light damage that could be repaired in a few hours with some basic spare parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, despite the deficiencies and inefficiencies of the Russian Army’s artillery forces, in their present form they remain a major obstacle to Ukrainian forces, enabling continued Russian offensive operations and impeding Ukrainian counterattacks. Breaking down Russia’s fires dominance is critical if Ukrainian forces are to be able to retake ground and stem their current high rate of attrition. The main weakness of the Russian artillery system is the logistics burden posed by the transportation and stockpiling of the vast quantity of shells that allows Russia to continue to manoeuvre by fire. Russian dependence on the railway network as the primary means of transporting war stocks was well understood before the war. Due to a lack of planning time for lower echelons, Russia struggled to move materiel from rail heads to its frontline positions in the opening phase of the conflict. During April, however, a system of contractorisation for moving materiel from railheads to the divisional rear was developed, with military units then shifting ammunition to large ammunition depots behind the main artillery concentrations. From there, the ammunition is shuttled to the guns. The reliance on railheads and civilian vehicles, which are largely restricted to road movement, makes key bottlenecks in Russian artillery highly predictable. Moreover, the ammunitions dumps at the divisional and brigade level are large, distinct, hard to conceal or defend, and slow to relocate. Given Ukraine’s limited capacity to strike at the Russian military’s rear echelons and fight a deep battle, this is a weakness that is yet to be widely capitalised upon. Isolated strikes on ammunition dumps show what is possible but given the disparity in guns and the shortage of Russian precision fires, the fastest way to level the playing field is to enable Ukraine to strike Russian artillery logistics. The critical factor in this is precision, range and payload. Ukraine needs strike systems with a sufficiently powerful warhead to ignite stored ammunition or damage key logistical infrastructure, accurate enough to hit these targets precisely, and with the range to do so from beyond Russian howitzer fire. The best system for this is MLRS, although with a more powerful munition than the UK’s reduced lethality unitary warhead GMLRS. These capabilities need to be provided at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In breaking up the Russian fires complex, targeting ammunition would significantly reduce the volume of fire that Russia could bring to bear and thereby offer advantage to the force able to strike with greater precision. Although Ukrainian ammunition consumption may not rise to Russian levels, the destruction of Russian guns and the provision of close support to Ukrainian units will necessitate a significant number of both howitzers and shells. Given that 152-mm ammunition is in limited supply and NATO countries lack production lines for this nature, it will be necessary to provide Ukraine with a large number of 155-mm howitzers and a consistent supply of ammunition. One challenge here is that NATO standardisation is not very standardised, with different countries’ howitzers not only having completely different maintenance requirements but also using different charges, fuses and sometimes shells. The current approach by which each country donates a battery of guns in a piecemeal way is rapidly turning into a logistical nightmare for Ukrainian forces with each battery requiring a separate training, maintenance and logistics pipeline. Making support to Ukraine sustainable requires the provision of one or two kinds of gun and for countries to step up production of the appropriate ammunition. It will also necessitate the establishment of second-line maintenance for these systems. Of course, these efforts will be of limited value if Ukrainian forces cannot find their targets in a timely manner, and so we must turn to the electromagnetic spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;contesting-the-spectrum&quot;&gt;Contesting the Spectrum&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukraine is to defeat Russian fires through a combination of range and precision, its armed forces need a kill chain that can identify and communicate the location of Russian targets. This can either be delivered by UAVs, reconnaissance teams or electronic direction finding. All these methods, however, are hindered by Russia’s EW complexes which are integral to Russian concepts of operation. It is therefore necessary to assess how these are being employed in Ukraine, their limitations and where they present tactical challenges that must be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial phase of the war in Ukraine is not indicative of Russian EW capabilities because the confusion caused by a lack of planning time led to fratricide, poor command coordination and thus many Russian EW systems being kept off. Subsequently, the Russian armed forces have started to use their EW capabilities more systematically. On 6 June 2022, for example, a field assessment of the Russian armed forces concluded that ‘the enemy’s UAVs, high-precision loitering and artillery ammunition and communications equipment rely on positioning through the reception of signals from satellite radio navigation systems’. To protect Russian forces from these capabilities, it was recommended that they continuously suppress access to satellite navigation through the constant operation of the Pole-21 system and the constant employment of the R330Zh, both on maximum power using omnidirectional jamming. The advice noted that these systems could be deconflicted with the employment of Orlan-10 UAVs by the Russian forces. The effect on Russian command and control was limited by the linking of command posts by ground-laid field cable, which Ukrainian forces have noted is now always emplaced within hours of the Russians setting up a position. Both Pole-21 and R330Zh are turned off prior to the commencement of Russian artillery strikes that may need to rely on accurate satellite-based positioning. In practice, while widespread, coverage is not constant because the R330Zh requires a significant supply of fuel to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more active layer in the Russian EW defence architecture is provided by Shipovnik-Aero, a truck-mounted jamming system optimised for targeting UAVs but also capable of suppressing a range of communications networks. The system has a range of 15 km and detects UAVs through their control frequency. The system takes approximately 25 seconds to analyse the control frequencies of newly encountered UAVs, and around 2 seconds to reconfirm the control frequencies of previously encountered UAVs. It then jams the command frequency. In addition, the system overrides the positioning of the UAV so that ‘return to base’ protocols lead the UAV to land in a location designated by the Russians. The Shipovnik-Aero has two workstations and is able to engage two UAVs at a time. Its jamming effect is delivered on a bearing with a width of approximately 3 degrees, suppressing friendly and civilian signals in the targeted bands within this area. Although these systems are not universally available to Russian formations, their presence has become widespread, limiting the airspace that Ukrainian UAVs are able to penetrate and monitor. The Shipovnik-Aero can take up to 40 minutes to set up and, like many other Russian EW systems, is therefore vulnerable to suppression through forced displacement or strike if its position can be determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge faced by Ukrainian troops is that Russian direction finding is highly capable and where it is not possible to suppress UAVs, it is often possible to target the ground control station. The means by which ground control stations have been targeted depends on the type of UAV and its range, but has included the dedicated firing of 152-mm howitzers, 300-mm MLRS and Tochka-U at UAV operators. Between these threats and those of EW causing UAVs to crash, or interception by air-defence systems, the lifespan of Ukrainian UAVs is roughly 7 days with some variation by system. In consequence, many Ukrainian units are forced to choose between having a live feed from their UAVs and thereby risking a high likelihood of losing the platform or sending UAVs out on pre-set flight plans and analysing the images they take on their return to a pre-set location. The use of jamming detection and inertial navigation can mitigate against the jamming of satellite navigation for a UAV following a pre-set flight plan. However, this method imposes a significant time delay between a target being identified in a location and the capacity of Ukrainian forces to bring fires to bear. This is either because the enemy is not in the location that the UAV was pre-programmed to examine requiring subsequent UAV launches, or because of the time required to conduct the analysis and confirmation of images after the UAV has completed its flight, compounded by the analytical challenge of confirming the coordinates of targets observed when accurate satellite navigation over the target area is denied. During fieldwork, the authors observed that a UAV launched to observe Russian positions in the latter manner did not face serious interference from EW, but that a subsequent UAV flying with a command link came under electronic attack as soon as it approached Russian forces. At present, it is widely observed that the Russians rarely displace from favourable positions once established. This, however, is likely a consequence of Ukraine having so few means to strike these targets, and it must be assumed that if Ukraine were to gain the means to strike – as outlined in the previous section – Russian units would begin to displace at intervals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians have had very limited success in denying Ukrainian communications. Despite Russian forces fielding EW complexes dedicated to the suppression of satellites, such as the 1RL257 Krasukha-4, the density of the Starlink satellite architecture means that Ukrainian forces are able to maintain reliable satellite connections across tactical formations. Cyber attacks against satellite architectures have been disruptive, but periodic, and the effect has not been something that the Russians can synchronise with other actions. Where 1RL257 has proven more effective is in the preparatory jamming of radar and other defensive systems in preparation of large-scale artillery or air strikes. Another element of the use of EW in an offensive role is the TORN-MDM signals intelligence vehicle, capable of direction finding and triangulating tactical communications within a radius of between 30 and 70 km depending on frequency. This system can also record and analyse communications, with the organic capacity to attempt decryption. Although Harris radios have been found to function despite Russian EW and to have robust encryption, Motorola radios used extensively by Ukrainian forces are more suspectable to jamming and technical examination suggests the signals are decrypted, although it takes around two hours. Training, tactics and procedures can mitigate the risk to operational security as a result of this penetration for tactical actions but it severely limits the Ukrainian capacity to disseminate operationally relevant orders and instructions in a secure manner and is therefore a constraining factor in the scale at which Ukrainian forces can coordinate. A further complication is the Russian employment of Leer-3 EW payloads mounted on Orlan-10 UAVs to target cell phone networks. While widely employed, the effect of these systems has been limited by their protracted employment over the past 8 years in Donbas so that Ukrainian forces are familiar with the risks posed by the system and effective countermeasures to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, Russian EW employment is not preventing Ukrainian communications and denying access to the electromagnetic spectrum. However, it is disrupting, limiting the accuracy of positioning, and slowing down vital kill chains and imposing significant limitations on Ukrainian reconnaissance in depth. Because long-range strike depends on precision systems, which are only available in limited numbers, Russian EW is a critical barrier to Ukrainian forces effectively employing the highly capable Western systems that could enable them to win the firefight and undermine Russia’s most important advantage. A means of countering Russian EW is thus necessary to enable Ukraine to conduct timely and accurate reconnaissance. The best method of delivering this effect is a radar-homing seeker payload for explosive-laden UAVs. Ukraine has the industrial capacity to manufacture airframes at scale, and there is a significant advantage in allowing Ukraine to develop multiple wing-forms for this mission because it makes the detection, classification and destruction of the UAVs much harder for Russian forces. However, a robust, cheap and reliable seeker that can be provided at scale is the critical component to enable this capability. Even if such a system did not account for a large number of destroyed Russian EW systems, because all EW complexes must emit – save for collection systems such as the TORN-MDM – they are readily targeted in this manner. Russian forces can avoid the destruction of their systems by leaving them off or displacing. Given that most EW complexes take between 25–40 minutes to set up, however, forcing displacement is an effective means of suppression that, in turn, would create many windows of opportunity for Ukrainian UAVs and reconnaissance teams to communicate the position of Russian systems in real time and determine the exact coordinates of positively identified high-value targets. The development of a cheap seeker that can be provided to Ukraine at scale is therefore a critical capability that Ukraine’s partners should immediately prioritise. If Ukraine can counter Russian EW, it becomes possible to apply accurate fires to counteract the shaping by massed Russian artillery and thereby bring about the favourable conditions for Ukrainian ground manoeuvre that are a pre-condition to the liberation of occupied Ukrainian territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hectares-lost-and-liberated&quot;&gt;Hectares Lost and Liberated&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground manoeuvre is an area in which Ukraine holds significant advantages, but as these advantages are primarily related to the defence there will need to be significant support to enable Ukraine to retake lost ground. To begin with the Russian ground forces, at the beginning of the invasion, Russian units were organised into BTGs that were often understrength in their infantry component but nevertheless predominantly made up of contract soldiers. Poor tactical employment combined with a shortage of infantry to support armour saw the Russians take exceedingly heavy equipment and personnel losses. In the aftermath of the withdrawal from Kyiv, Russian forces have sought to reconstitute their forces in two ways. First, they have offered short-term contracts for service in Ukraine with inflated salaries. Second, the Russian government has been conducting a stealthy mobilisation of older citizens with prior military experience and with technical competences in order to reduce the training time for their integration into the force. Having raised the age for eligible service, the Russian government assesses that it has 1.6 million people within its current target group for mobilisation. Ukrainian officials are predicting that 9 million Russians will be unemployed by the end of the year, potentially increasing those volunteering for service. Nevertheless, the draft appears extremely unpopular and even among hard Russian nationalists is seen as a signal that the government has conducted the war incompetently. Furthermore, bottlenecks in government records, training capacity and equipment serviceability mean that the Russian government cannot pull all these individuals into uniform in a short space of time. Instead, the process of mobilisation is anticipated to be an ongoing one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dynamics outlined above have created several problems for Russian ground forces. First, their units are now amalgamations of troops with variable levels of training, experience and equipment and with little time spent working together. The lack of a professional non-commissioned officer corps in the Russian Army has inhibited the cohesion of these composite units. Furthermore, the massive casualties among Russia’s contract soldiers – disproportionately concentrated among the airborne and special forces – in the first month of the war has left many soldiers who survived to be very reluctant to embark on offensive operations. Thus, the most experienced troops who ought to be critical to leading newly mobilised personnel are, in many cases, the most reluctant to prosecute attacks. The result is that Russian forces on the offensive lack momentum, and demand massive artillery preparation of their objectives as well as overwhelming numerical superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these deficiencies, the Russians continue to seize ground and are inflicting casualties on the Ukrainian military at an average rate of 100 per day. There are several reasons for this. First, the artillery dominance of the Russian forces prevents Ukrainian troops from concentrating much above the size of the company group. Russian forces, which are not under a comparable artillery threat, can concentrate at the decisive point and are therefore achieving localised force ratios upwards of 7:1 on their main effort. Furthermore, by operating across a broader front, Russian forces are better able to exploit their considerable firepower and resilience than during their attempts at a coup de main against Kyiv. Furthermore, after taking massive casualties, the Russians have once again taken up their lessons from Chechnya and Syria and begun to employ mobile storm groups to spearhead offensive operations in urban areas, built around 20-person assault teams supported by armour. This tactical adaptation has enabled Russian forces to make greater progress in urban fighting, with casualty rates among Russian and Ukrainian units currently approaching parity, despite the Russians usually being on the offensive. Although Ukrainian troops are much better motivated, Russian numerical superiority and the ability to kill Ukrainian forces with artillery as they manoeuvre mean that Ukrainian units continue to cede ground and to pay disproportionately on the offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enabling Ukraine to defeat Russian ground manoeuvre forces is not just a matter of winning the artillery war. Ukrainian troops must be able to take the offensive, and here it is necessary to address some serious misconceptions about the structure and capabilities of the Ukrainian Army. US commentators have applauded excellent Ukrainian tactical proficiency and often ascribed this to Ukraine adopting a professional non-commissioned officer corps. This is an impression produced by disproportionate interaction with a small number of highly capable Ukrainian units that have had long exposure to NATO. To step into the headquarters of the 95th Air Assault Brigade, for example, would be a very familiar experience for any NATO officer. The layout of the room, range of specialisms present, orders process and culture, with briefings delivered by junior officers and soldiers under the supervision of their superiors, is similar to what prevails in the most proficient NATO command posts. The 95th Brigade – and several others – also have non-commissioned officers who have interacted extensively with NATO counterparts. Speak to them about their role, however, and they are the first to admit that there is little standardisation of how non-commissioned officer posts are used by commanders across the Ukrainian Army, that professional military education for the corps was nascent before the war and that their units are not representative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most units of the Ukrainian armed forces today contain a significant proportion of civilians with limited military experience, mobilised technical specialists with considerable expertise but without rank, and small numbers of professional soldiers who have rarely operated at scale. The culture is highly egalitarian. Orders groups are more akin to debates in which the commander’s statement of the mission objective results in a chaotic discussion enabling all participants to raise questions, concerns and ideas. The result is often an innovative and technically complex tactical scheme and is a large cause for Ukraine’s widespread tactical successes. It is an approach that maximises the contribution of motivated soldiers with a wealth of creativity and a wide range of competences. However, such a process, while viable in platoon and company groups, is not replicable at scale. In battalion- and brigade-sized actions, which is the minimum level at which full combined arms capabilities come together and is therefore the level at which offensive actions are most successfully undertaken, commanders must often make decisions that trade risk against a part of their force in exchange for advantage in another. This is a process that is not best reached by consensus but by unity of command, a clear orders process and mechanisms to oversee the implementation of orders. In many Ukrainian units, the lack of planning staffs and non-commissioned officers to manage execution of rapidly transmitted orders make the transition from defence to offence challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, because of poor pay prior to the conflict, the Ukrainian armed forces had trained vastly more technical specialists – such as mechanics, drivers and pilots – than it required to fill its order of battle. This was because of chronic retention problems. Now that Ukrainian society has been fully mobilised, the force has an abundance of technical specialists, and this is supplemented by civilian engineers, programmers and skilled professionals who make the Ukrainian military creative and able to build and employ a wide range of innovative capabilities. However, while this is exceedingly useful for communications, technical surveillance and reconnaissance, EW and other functions, the core of effective offensive operations relies on not only the much-needed uplift in military equipment but also the infantry fieldcraft, tankmanship, tactical proficiency and the well-practised coordination of these elements into true combined arms manoeuvre. Troops and commanders who are highly proficient in this are in far shorter supply. To compensate for the dearth of field experience in many Territorial Defence Battalions, the Ukrainian armed forces broke up some of their best units to push experienced infanteers into newly formed units. In the defence, this has led to reasonable combat performance by these troops. For the attack, however, the Ukrainian armed forces have found it necessary to bring their best units back together and have them spearhead attacks. The combination of distributing a limited supply of highly proficient professional soldiers across frontline units, and then their concentration for offensive operations, has seen disproportionate casualties among Ukraine’s most-capable troops. If Ukraine is to effectively fight a manoeuvrist war, able to withdraw from enemy concentrations and punish the Russians with fires, while setting up counterattacks to break up Russian formations, it will be necessary to improve the tactical soldiering skills across a significant number of Ukrainian troops from the various combat arms and to ensure that the staffs at brigade level are able to effectively employ these units. UK training of 10,000 infantry will help, but will be insufficient without staff and junior leadership training. The survivability of Ukrainian forces while manoeuvring also requires protected mobility able to survive Russian fires. It is also important that newly trained Ukrainian troops are not filtered into units piecemeal to simply maintain troop levels but are instead held in formed units that can offer higher Ukrainian echelons available units of action to execute manoeuvre and thereby unhinge Russia’s operations. If Ukraine can execute offensive manoeuvre, it will quickly take the initiative away from the Russians and thereby reduce the current massing of unfavourable force ratios at key points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ukraine’s international partners, enabling Ukraine to shift on to the offensive to retake its lost territories requires three lines of effort. First, there is a need to deliver infantry training to newly raised Ukrainian units at scale. Second, there is a need to deliver staff training at the brigade and divisional level to help expand the scale at which Ukraine can orchestrate operations. Third, there is a need to provide a standardised protected mobility platform with first- and second-line maintenance to give newly formed brigades the equipment to remain survivable while they concentrate. All of these are tasks that Ukraine’s international partners have the capability to deliver. The US has managed to gift armoured vehicles by the acre to allies in the Middle East. Even large numbers of armoured HMMWVs would be preferable to a smorgasbord of antiquated vehicle fleets. In the Balkans, MPRI’s support to Croatian forces during Operation Storm is a demonstration of how staff capacity can be rapidly expanded. Large-scale infantry training is something that has been conducted multiple times over the past 30 years. The question is how Ukraine’s partners plan to share the burden of these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-land-without-safety&quot;&gt;A Land Without Safety&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the initial phase of operations, both the Russian Air Force and the Ukrainian Air Force have found that much of the air over enemy territory is denied to them. For Russia, a lack of pilot training for large-formation flying, limited capabilities for the suppression of air defences and the lack of unified command of air operations led to a significant number of aircraft losses and poor effects on Ukrainian territory. For Ukraine, the density and lethality of Russian air defences have meant that its air force cannot routinely approach areas of active operations, while helicopters are employed sparingly, only to areas confirmed to lack coverage from air defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the longer-ranged Russian air-defence systems provide protection over the frontlines, the Russians have been able to maintain a significant tempo of close air support strikes in Mariupol and Donbas. However, the density of Ukrainian MANPADS forces Russian aircraft to fly at dusk and dawn, and at higher altitudes, limiting accuracy with unguided munitions. Against helicopters, Ukrainian forces report that Igla and Stinger MANPADS are routinely defeated by Russian countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Russia’s ability to strike targets deep inside Ukraine is not removed by the denial of airspace to the VKS. From the first days of the war, Russia has struck across Ukraine with cruise and ballistic missiles. The initial failure by Russia to mass these fires against Ukrainian logistics and key infrastructure enabled Ukrainian forces to reposition in the opening stages of the war and is a partial cause of the failure of Russia’s attempt to seize Kyiv. Nevertheless, as the conflict protracts, Russia’s ability to strike wherever it wishes has a number of effects that are detrimental to Ukraine’s war effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, these strikes minimise Ukraine’s capacity to domestically produce defence materiel, to conduct large-scale maintenance of its combat systems, exercise new formations of troops or maintain significant fixed infrastructure. From the destruction of Yavoriv Training Base with a salvo of 30 missiles near Lviv on 13 March, to the concentration of a salvo of missiles against Kyiv on 26 June, Russia is capable of conducting large-scale strikes on selected targets. The persistent strikes on Ukrainian cities have an attritional effect on the confidence of the Ukrainian public in its security, the prospects for reconstruction and economic recovery, and the management of internally displaced people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also appears that Russia is striking targets in civilian areas to send political messages, and to hold civilian areas at risk. There is a persistent concern that Russian missile systems positioned in Belarus may move south to conduct a mass strike on the capital at short notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been widely reported that Russia is running out of these munitions. It is certainly true that all these long-range strike systems rely on foreign components that Western sanctions are limiting Russia’s access to. It is also clear that Russia has a limited stockpile. Nevertheless, at current rates of expenditure, strikes can continue for months. So long as the capacity to deliver these effects remains, they also have a shaping function on Ukrainian forces, the economy and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most destructive system employed against Ukraine is the Iskander-M quasi-ballistic missile, which is also the hardest to intercept. As it is manoeuvrable, the Iskander-M is exceedingly difficult for ballistic missile defence to plot an interception. Furthermore, it dispenses decoy emitters in its terminal phase, each approximately the size of a drinks can, which collectively expand and distort the contours and apparent trajectory of the missile when interrogated by radar. Despite being highly effective, Iskander-M is both one of Russia’s scarcer weapons systems and central to its concepts for defence against NATO, limiting the number of munitions that are used. The vast majority of strikes against Ukraine are conducted using cruise missiles, including: the 9M727 launched from the Iskander transporter erector launcher; the Kh-101 mainly launched from bombers from the north of Ukraine; the Kh-59 air- and ground-launched cruise missile; and the 3M-54 Kalibr launched in large numbers from Russian vessels in the Black Sea. The launch method, range and payload of these munitions varies, but they also have a large number of common characteristics and components. For example, some computers for processing sensor data are common in both the 9M727 and Kalibr missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The similarities between these missiles mean that they have comparable advantages and vulnerabilities. They are subsonic (though some variants can go supersonic in their terminal dive), low flying and manoeuvrable. The selection of waypoints en route to target allows these missiles to avoid detection by defensive radar if the locations of these defences have been established. Russian forces have been observed to use E95M air targets to encourage the illumination and thereby mapping of defensive radar. In any case, these missiles give little warning to missile defence systems and can often approach targets from poorly defended or even undefended trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consequence of the manoeuvrability of these missiles is that, when they enter Ukrainian air space, their eventual destination cannot be determined – even if they are observed on a particular trajectory, they can turn to fly in a completely different direction. As a result, the Ukrainians must initiate their air raid warnings across a very wide area. However, multiple such alerts a day lead to many people ignoring the air raid warning, placing them at risk when the missiles eventually reach their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The missiles rely on a range of sensors to guide their flight. Several have imaging capabilities and can compare the footage to pre-loaded mapping. Others use radar for a similar purpose. They also tend to have an aerial mounted on the top of the missile for receiving satellite signals and have fibre-optic gyroscopes for inertial navigation in case weather, enemy countermeasures or damage denies access to their primary sensors. Interestingly, the Iskander 9M727 cruise missile – and this may be true of the others also – relies on GPS and GLONAS for its satellite navigation and is unable to receive BeiDou signals. The GPS is the primary navigation tool for the missile, probably because Russian satellite coverage over target countries is intermittent and because it is assumed that the enemy will not deny GPS signals over territory that they control. Briefings by the Pentagon have reported that a large number of Russian cruise missiles fail to either find their targets or malfunction and crash in flight. As far as Ukrainian military scientists can determine, this is actually quite rare. Because of their subsonic flight, Ukrainian troops can indicate to nearby units when these cruise missiles overfly them, and this has enabled Ukrainian Zu-23 gunners to prepare to engage munitions in flight. Other cruise missiles have been shot down by Ukrainian air-defence systems, including SA-11 and by fast air interceptors. Many of the downed missiles exhibit signs of having been hit in the fuselage and wing by cannon fire or fragmentation blasts, suffering damage to either their sensors or control surfaces and therefore having their stability in flight compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that ground-based anti-aircraft artillery, ground-to-air and air-to-air missiles are able to knock out the majority of Russia’s long-range precision-strike capabilities, it is evident that Ukraine needs two kinds of support. First, there is the need for a means to disseminate cruise missile track data more effectively. For a warning system inside Ukraine, this could be app based, with civilians encouraged to tap to indicate when a cruise missile is overflying them. The cyber security of this architecture would be critical. More importantly, however, the provision of point defences for Ukrainian critical military infrastructure would be highly beneficial. Although Ukrainian air defences have proven capable of intercepting Russian missiles, there are too few of these platforms to provide adequate coverage given that the low flight profile of cruise missiles makes the area that a given air defence battery can cover very small. Instead, capabilities such as C-RAM and some EW systems could enable Ukraine to significantly harden critical areas in its rear to expand its ability to sustain domestic war production and to secure training sites that will be critical to the ongoing reconstitution of Ukrainian ground elements. Additional stocks of air-to-air missiles also offer the prospects of the continued interception of cruise missiles by the Ukrainian Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian victory is possible, but only with international support. In the absence of that support Ukraine may either be worn down through attrition and economically strangled, or else fight a protracted and bloody war over several years. International support so far has been hugely consequential in enabling Ukraine to survive but has also been piecemeal and is introducing significant logistical frictions into the Ukrainian military. The first step in delivering effective support to Ukraine is the rationalisation of the equipment being provided with standardisation of platforms and munitions supported by appropriate maintenance. Burden-sharing between Western defence industry and governments will be important. For this purpose, a committee to agree a process for rationalisation of support should be established to ensure its sustainability, where allies agree to each provide specific kinds of capability at scale, rather than each state offer small numbers of a wide range of capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has sought to outline Ukraine’s foremost tactical requirements if it is to be able to retake the ground lost to Russia and thereby achieve the operational defeat of the Russian Army. First, Ukraine must suppress Russia’s artillery advantage by destroying the logistical enablement of Russia’s massed fires. Second, Ukraine must employ its own fires to prevent Russia concentrating to achieve positive force ratios. Third, the Ukrainian military must be able to strike Russia’s EW architecture to enable the kill chains to win the fire fight. Fourth, this should enable Ukrainian offensive ground manoeuvre, but will require large-scale training in infantry skills, support to Ukrainian brigade and divisional planning, and the provision of protected mobility. Finally, Ukrainian training bases, critical national infrastructure and population centres need greater protection from Russian long-range precision strikes, which demands the provision of support in tracking cruise missiles and point defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The priorities for equipment support to Ukraine may be defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MLRS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;52-calibre 155-mm howitzers and a consistent supply of ammunition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anti-radiation seekers for loitering munitions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Harris radios or comparably secure tactical communications.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anti-tank guided weapons capable of overflight or top attack, most notably NLAW, Javelin and Brimstone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visually guided MANPADS such as Starstreak and Martlet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Protected mobility platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Point defence systems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Second-line maintenance support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale and longevity of support that Ukraine requires is significant and will stretch many Western allies. These requirements cannot be met through the donation of existing stocks but will instead require the production of new munitions. The cost may lead Western states to slow-roll the provision of support. In practice, however, a slow attritional conflict will be much more costly in the long term. Rationalising support to Ukraine today and delivering capability at scale is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Russia is to be convinced that stopping its invasion is the best line of policy – just as the Russian military determined that it had to withdraw from Kyiv – then the Kremlin must be convinced that it cannot win through a protracted conflict that exhausts Ukrainian stockpiles and Western resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some setbacks since 2014, crony capitalism’s stakeholders have shown their ability to continue to manipulate Ukraine’s public institutions in the face of the deepest set of reforms undertaken since independence, as well as in conditions of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dismantling the networks of systema will require a combination of deep structural reforms, preventive and repressive measures to curb corruption, and civic activism to hold politicians, officials and business owners accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research paper sets out how systema operates across key sectors of Ukraine’s economy, and identifies the main mechanisms that enable its stakeholders to preserve their privileges and divert public resources. It also considers the factors that may change the behaviour of those who benefit from crony capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s systema – commonly described as oligarkhiya in Ukraine – grew out of a specific form of crony capitalism that took root in the late 1990s. It has proved impressively resilient and adaptive to political and economic disruption since the 2004–05 Orange Revolution. It allocates resources inefficiently and in ways that do not benefit society, and increases economic costs by reducing competition. At the same time, it weakens institutions and perpetuates high levels of inequality and corruption. As such, it is the underlying obstacle to the development of fully functioning democratic institutions and rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Systema has proved particularly hard to dislodge because it rests on a firm alignment of interests between big business and the political class in favour of rent seeking over wealth creation for the public good. Across the state sector, and at different levels, it has spawned an extensive supporting structure of beneficiaries that service those interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Systema’s structures are in place not just in Kyiv but across the country. The same operating principles are replicated at regional level for the benefit of powerful local elites and their accomplices in regional governments and councils.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The influence of systema across the banking, energy, transport and healthcare sectors rests on the same foundations, and achieves broadly similar results for its stakeholders, even if some reforms have significantly reduced opportunities for the levels of rent seeking seen before the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. The agricultural sector is anomalous partly because of the absence of the main financial-industrial groups (FIGs) and because the issue of land reform resonates strongly with society and has limited the ambitions of some of the influential players.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main FIGs dominate the media sector because ownership of media assets is vital for influencing politics and thereby preserving their influence. Over time, however, a combination of regulatory changes, digital disruption, and the appearance of new channels and new models of media business may erode their control of the sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although systema has undoubtedly suffered setbacks since the Revolution of Dignity, it still has considerable residual strength, and the ability to undo some of the most important achievements of the reforms undertaken since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Systema has left Ukraine with a serious lack of expertise in government that contributes to weak state capacity. The major FIGs attract and retain much of the best talent in the country, putting it to work to make governing institutions work for them. This imbalance is likely to take many years to correct.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reducing the influence of systema requires changing the calculus of the main players. Rent seeking needs to become more difficult, to carry greater risk and to be less profitable than wealth creation through the establishment of well-managed, transparent businesses that attract investment and generate employment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ukraine’s system of crony capitalism reflects the absence of a strong state, and an enduring relationship between big business and the political class that puts their own interests before those of society.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The form of crony capitalism that emerged in Ukraine in the late 1990s has proved impressively resilient and adaptive to political and economic disruption since the Orange Revolution in 2004–05, followed by the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. It functions based on a deeply integrated network bound by shared interests described here as systema, but known more commonly in Ukraine as oligarkhiya. Breaking its grip is essential for the consolidation of democratic institutions and the development of rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systema is by no means a uniquely Ukrainian phenomenon. Variations of the same model exist to different degrees around the world, including in ‘old’ EU member states such as Greece and Italy as well as ‘new’ ones such as Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania. Unlike its Russian analogue, which rests on a centralized structure of power, Ukraine’s systema reflects the absence of a strong state. The common features of these governance models are high concentrations of capital in the hands of a small number of politically connected business owners in environments characterized by institutions that siphon public money for the benefit of the few, low levels of transparency, limited accountability and weak rule of law. To different degrees, the effects include the undermining of democratic governance, the distortion of economies, and the promotion of criminality and corrupt practices through the influence on public policy of a dominant group’s business interests. In short, these systems seriously hinder the functioning of an autonomous state for the public good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts often describe the ability of Ukraine’s major financial-industrial groups (FIGs) to penetrate parliament and the agencies of government in order to put their interests before those of the country as ‘state capture’, or ‘regulatory capture’. However, what is happening is not the one-way process that these terms imply. There is a symbiotic relationship between big business and politicians and officials in which each needs the other to sustain a system that allocates resources for their benefit. The FIGs depend on politicians, who are sometimes their direct representatives, to pass favourable laws and ensure the state apparatus implements them. Major business owners such as Rinat Akhmetov, Viktor Pinchuk and former president Petro Poroshenko have even served in parliament themselves, as Poroshenko does again now. At the same time, large numbers of politicians depend on the FIGs to finance their campaigns and to deploy media assets in support of their combined interests. Both sides benefit from their ability to influence the judicial system. ‘Shadow state’ is perhaps a more accurate description of such a model in which institutions are co-opted and subverted rather than ‘captured’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pernicious fusion of interests on the part of big business and a ‘service’ class creates systema. While its effects are visible in Ukraine’s poor economic performance for much of the period since independence, and in its disturbingly high levels of inequality, much of the fabric of systema is non-transparent and lives in the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine typifies what some social scientists describe as a ‘limited access order’, in which a ruling class artificially restricts political and economic competition to amass wealth and protect itself. Since the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, systema’s stakeholders have shown their ability to continue to manipulate public institutions not just in the face of the deepest set of reforms undertaken since independence, but also in conditions of war. Putting their own interests before those of society, they have shown their determination to allow as little change as possible to the functioning of systema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have sustained an economic model of rent seeking that prevents the creation of a level playing field by granting benefits to some companies over others. Not only does a system of this kind allocate resources inefficiently and in ways that do not benefit society, it increases economic costs by reducing competition. A further damaging side effect is the co-optation by its participants of the law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to safeguard their assets and revenue streams as well as to ensure their immunity from prosecution. Over the years, this has limited possibilities for reforming the police, the security services, the Prosecutor’s Office and the judiciary. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that Ukraine continues to score poorly in the World Justice Project’s Rule of Law Index. In 2020, it ranked 72nd overall out of 128 countries and jurisdictions assessed – albeit six places higher than the previous year. However, it ranked 110th in the category ‘absence of corruption’, and 90th in ‘criminal justice’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subversion of the legal system also creates possibilities for organized crime to operate alongside business. The problem deepened under Viktor Yanukovych’s presidency in 2010–14: mafia structures in Donbas colluded with government agencies, including the Security Service. There is no evidence to suggest that the problem of organized crime in Ukraine has diminished. It is part of a deeply rooted social culture that goes back to the 19th century, materializing in the form of a brotherhood of ‘thieves’ with its own laws and morals. The revolutionary environment of 2014 and its aftermath created increased opportunities for organized crime, particularly people-trafficking and drug-smuggling, as the new authorities focused on containing the uprising in Donbas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power of systema is reflected in the concentration of economic assets. According to 2015 data, politically connected businesses accounting for less than 1 per cent of companies in Ukraine owned more than 25 per cent of all assets and accessed over 20 per cent of debt financing. In the capital-intensive mining, energy and transport sectors, politically connected businesses accounted for over 40 per cent of turnover and 50 per cent of assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;According to 2015 data, politically connected businesses accounting for less than 1 per cent of companies in Ukraine owned more than 25 per cent of all assets and accessed over 20 per cent of debt financing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the second half of the 1990s, when systema originally took root under President Leonid Kuchma, these businesses have used their political relationships to pursue a wide range of rent-seeking opportunities, including rigged public procurement tenders and privileged access to state aid, tax benefits, soft loans and debt guarantees from state banks. Several of these practices have continued since 2014 despite the closure of some of the largest schemes, notably in the banking, energy and healthcare sectors. However, political influence still translates into the capacity to gain business advantage by encouraging monopolistic practices. This is particularly visible in the energy industry. It is no coincidence, for example, that Ukraine ranked 128th out of 190 countries for ‘getting electricity’ in the World Bank’s 2020 Ease of Doing Business rankings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systema has proved particularly hard to dislodge because it rests on a firm alignment of interests between big business and the political class in favour of rent seeking over wealth creation for the public good. Across the state sector at different levels, it has spawned an extensive supporting structure of beneficiaries that service those interests. Including dependents, this interest group comprises millions of people. This translates into a sizeable constituency in Ukrainian society that wishes to preserve this model and sees danger in reforms that could undermine it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear to what extent President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his team have ever felt able to disrupt systema in order to achieve their declared goals of rapid economic growth and reduced levels of corruption. On the face of it, Zelenskyy’s election mandate in 2019 gave him an unprecedented opportunity to use his popularity and his parliamentary majority, based on first-term MPs, to start developing a new model of governance – one that prioritizes society’s interests over those of the ruling class. However, his performance so far, exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, suggests that he cannot govern without systema and will bow to its interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of significant developments in 2020 pointed to the renewed influence of interest groups opposed to changing the established rules of the game. First, in March 2020, was the dismissal of the government of prime minister Oleksiy Honcharuk, followed, a day later, by the removal from office of the reformist prosecutor-general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka. Then, in April, came the Constitutional Court’s blocking of judicial reforms, and a ruling by the same court, in October, that effectively paralysed the work of the National Agency for Corruption Prevention. Evidently, the Revolution of Dignity did not bring about the dismantling of these old networks, which also oppose Western influence on the reform agenda and, in some cases, propagate anti-Western disinformation. In the case of the Constitutional Court, four of the 15 sitting judges in October 2020 were holdovers from the Yanukovych era who had taken up their positions before the start of post-revolutionary judicial reform and the adoption of a new anti-corruption strategy. Those appointed later were part of the same ‘judicial corporation’, with its own interests and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper shows how Ukraine’s systema remains in place across the main sectors of the economy, and identifies the main mechanisms of control that enable its stakeholders to preserve their privileges and divert public resources. It also considers the factors that may change the behaviour of systema’s participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis deliberately avoids the terms ‘oligarchs’ and ‘undue influence’, as both mischaracterize the underlying governance problem facing Ukraine. One challenge for reformist forces is to develop a new vocabulary in Ukrainian and English that will more accurately describe certain features of systema and the obstacles to reducing its influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is not an oligarchy in the classic sense because it is not ruled by a small group of individuals. As noted above, while the owners of the largest business groups hold considerable sway over aspects of economic policy, they depend on a wider group of government officials, members of parliament, policy experts and managers of state companies to exercise their power. Some among this ‘service class’ are direct representatives of FIGs, but the majority are not. They have their own interests and influence channels. Competing regional interests further complicate the picture. Thus, to this extent, power is shared. Adopting policies requires consensus building and trading of positions with individuals that these business owners do not always directly control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Undue influence’ is a misnomer for two reasons. First, the main stakeholders are more than just influencers. They are often actors in their own right, as systema allows them to participate directly in decision-making on state policy outside formal institutions. Zelenskyy’s request, in March 2020, to leading businesses to support the government’s efforts to tackle the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is a recent example of how this can happen openly. Poroshenko’s appointment of two leading businessmen, Igor Kolomoisky and Serhiy Taruta, in 2014 to run southeastern regions is another. Second, Ukraine’s system of governance has not yet evolved to the point at which it is possible to describe key stakeholders’ influence as ‘undue’ or excessive. In a limited access order, this is the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;systemas-four-pillars&quot;&gt;Systema’s Four Pillars&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite their privileges, the companies controlled by the Ukraine’s major financial-industrial groups – the primary stakeholders in systema – are less productive and slower to increase growth and create jobs than are non-politically connected companies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four pillars support systema in Ukraine and provide it with considerable stability:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deep penetration of government decision-making processes via senior officials who favour the interests of big business and benefit from these connections;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Influence over the legislative process including through paid-for support of MPs who either have direct business interests or stand to benefit indirectly from their support of the business interests of others;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Influence over the judiciary and law enforcement agencies through the appointment of loyal individuals, as well as the use of bribery and other incentives to protect systema’s interests; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Control of the media through ownership of the main outlets that provide a platform for selected politicians to develop their careers and for big business to shape public opinion in systema’s favour, including by attacking those who stand in its way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6y9eoij.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1. The four pillars supporting systema&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major FIGs in Ukraine have dominated the economy over the past two decades through their ownership of vertically integrated businesses across multiple sectors, including agriculture, banking, energy production and transmission, media, mining and steel. These are systema’s primary stakeholders. Despite their privileges, the companies controlled by the FIGs are less productive and slower to increase growth and create jobs than are non-politically connected companies. Preservation of this model has depended on keeping a large section of the economy in state hands. This has allowed the stakeholders to benefit either by managing state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to extract gain through preferences granted to them by the state, or by working closely with SOEs to do so. Not surprisingly, corporate governance reform has held little appeal for these groups, while privatization has advanced at a snail’s pace, and discriminatory conditions have often excluded foreign investors. Three decades on from the collapse of the Soviet economy, Ukraine still has around 3,700 SOEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the notable exceptions of PrivatBank and the national oil and gas company Naftogaz, the business operations of the FIGs have proved sustainable, despite the costs to society, because they have continued to create value for their owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FIGs compete with one another for influence and access to rents, but have a strong motivation to coexist according to a set of informal rules. The Yanukovych ‘clan’ violated these rules in its dash to place rent seeking under its centralized control. In the process, it destabilized systema and forfeited the support of other players who concluded that they were better off without it despite the disruption of revolution. Some were quick to find their balance again in the post-revolution world in which systema still held sway, others less so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rinat Akhmetov, one of Ukraine’s wealthiest business figures, was able to find an accommodation with President Poroshenko after 2014 that allowed him to rebuild his business after suffering serious losses because of the conflict in Donbas. His business interests do not appear to have suffered under Zelenskyy’s presidency, and his television channels have shown the president in a positive light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ihor Kolomoisky, one of Akhmetov’s rivals at the top table of business owners, initially allied himself with the Poroshenko administration, and as governor of Dnipropetrovsk region he played a key role in 2014 in mobilizing resistance against Russian efforts to destabilize southeastern Ukraine. He left the country following a rift with Poroshenko, only to make a triumphant return after Zelenskyy’s election, determined to contest the nationalization of PrivatBank, the centrepiece of his business empire, that had taken place under the Poroshenko administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts were quick to point to the influence of the major FIGs in the parliament that was elected in 2019. Volodymyr Fesenko, one of Ukraine’s top political commentators, noted in September of that year that Kolomoisky could count on the support of up to 30 MPs, Dmytro Firtash, a prominent player in the energy and chemicals sectors on 15, and Akhmetov on six. It is widely believed in Kyiv that Akhmetov’s direct influence on the government has increased since the 2019 elections, even if he controls far fewer votes in parliament. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal previously held a senior position at Akhmetov’s energy company DTEK, while Olha Buslavets, the acting energy minister from April–November 2020, had a professional background in Donetsk’s coal industry, which is dominated by Akhmetov. She denied reports of having ties to DTEK. Meanwhile, the influence of Firtash appears to have waned, as demonstrated by the recent decision of Ukraine’s Security and Defence Council to impose sanctions against him. Kolomoisky’s influence in parliament may have diminished in recent months, after the US authorities imposed sanctions, in January 2021, on his close associate in parliament Oleksandr Dubinsky. The earlier fracturing of Zelenskyy’s parliamentary majority had allowed Kolomoisky to control closer to 40 votes from the Servant of the People party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below these top-level FIGs are smaller groups that operate according to the same principles of rent seeking, but whose owners are not as visible and as networked in politics at the national level. They tend to have a local presence and to own local media outlets. Some of the bigger players in the agricultural and pharmaceutical industries fit into this category. Similarly, the biggest beneficiaries of Ukraine’s unreformed customs system, for example, are lower-level companies that avoid paying taxes through smuggling. They use some of the same mechanisms as the entities involved in large-scale rent seeking: penetration of the government system, including through collusion with law enforcement bodies, support in parliament, and use of the media to attack reformers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;systemas-structure&quot;&gt;Systema’s Structure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The striking feature of Ukraine’s systema is the depth of its penetration and replication in national and regional decision-making processes and within the bureaucracies that implement decisions across the country.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rent-seeking machinery in Ukraine operates at three levels. At the top, big business takes the largest cut. In the middle, systema’s enablers such as senior to mid-level government officials, MPs and managers of state-owned enterprises receive rewards from above and below as the largest and smallest players pay their dues. At the bottom are the low- to mid-level officials who collect bribes. They keep a portion for themselves but pass the greater part to their superiors. This is consistent with equivalent models of systema around the world. However, the striking feature of the Ukrainian version is the depth of its penetration in the national decision-making process and within the bureaucracy that implements decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systema’s structures are in place not just in Kyiv. Across the country, the same operating principles are replicated at regional level for the benefit of powerful local elites and their accomplices in regional governments and councils. This can sometimes mean that cities and regional administrations, because of their political power, are able to defy the authority of national agencies. This has been evident during the COVID-19 crisis, when some cities have chosen not to comply with restrictions issued by the central government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systema’s regional dimension gives it considerable additional stability through a hierarchy of interest groups below the biggest FIGs at the top. The decentralization reform begun after 2014 has strengthened regional and local elites. As the local elections in November 2020 showed, in Kharkiv and Odesa especially but in other major cities as well, mayors have built power bases that rest on their popularity as local leaders rather than on the appeal of national parties. The mayors of Kharkiv and Odesa have significant business interests. At lower administrative levels, the combination of political connections and wealth can also lead to local interests buying influence in regional centres and in Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motivations of the largest business owners often come into conflict over the distribution of rents, but such disagreements have not proved sufficiently disruptive to threaten systema’s foundations. These key business figures share an interest in having a common set of red lines that determine the level of reforms they are prepared to accept. Even if they find themselves marginalized or excluded, they seek a way back into systema rather than trying to transform it. Most know that their businesses would struggle to survive, let alone prosper, in a non-rent-seeking environment, and that they could not easily protect themselves in a law-governed state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences of this convergence of interests among FIGs are clearly visible in the form of a vicious circle of restricted competition in Ukraine’s politics and its economy, which results in permanently weak institutions, poor legislation and the absence of rule of law. Inevitably, this feeds corrupt practices at all levels, which provide the lubrication to keep systema’s wheels turning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systema succeeds in being self-sustaining because it keeps the barrier for entry into top-level politics particularly high for independent actors. This is partly due to Ukrainian politics being a competition of money rather than of ideas. For example, with no cap on campaign finance, only political actors with high levels of monetary support could compete in the 2019 presidential election. Indeed, according to the Centre for Democracy and Rule of Law, a Ukrainian NGO, the three highest-polling candidates each spent between $5 million and $21 million, mostly on TV advertising. By comparison, in Poland, where GDP per head is almost four times higher, campaign spending by candidates in the presidential election of 2015 together amounted to some $4.8 million. The high levels of election spending in Ukraine are partly attributable to the fact that campaigns start earlier than officially permitted, as well as the fact that there are no restrictions on campaign spending. A further problem that restricts competition is that under the current rules, political parties can hide their sources of financing by using intermediaries. At the same time, they do minimal public fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transforming a limited access order into an open access order typically takes decades, because of the complexity of changing the calculus of the main players while simultaneously nurturing independent institutions. In the case of Ukraine, however, the evidence of the past six years points to two contradictory patterns of development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, despite the exigencies of the armed conflict with Russia, which have revealed many of the country’s weaknesses, there is still no consensus within Ukraine’s ruling class about the need to change the way it is governed. Instead, the main FIGs have continued to compete for influence: Kolomoisky returned to Ukraine in 2019 on the eve of the presidential election; Viktor Medvedchuk (who was President Kuchma’s chief of staff) and Poroshenko were re-elected to parliament – although in May 2021 Medvedchuk was charged with high treason and placed under house arrest; and Akhmetov is once again in favour in the President’s Office. Even so, some reforms supported by Western countries have dramatically reduced certain opportunities for rent seeking and undercut the interests of some of systema’s beneficiaries. The IMF’s insistence on making financial assistance dependent on enacting specific anti-corruption reforms and other measures, including judicial reform, threatens to change the status quo irreversibly to the disadvantage of systema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, while these reforms remain incomplete, and there have been increasing signs that parts of systema have seen Zelenskyy’s presidency as an opportunity to recover ground lost during the Poroshenko years, that a president was chosen from outside the elite group demonstrates a striking rejection of the status quo by the electorate. This represents the most powerful challenge to systema over the past 20 years, one that it has moved fast to interrupt by replacing a reformist government and trying to upend the anti-corruption reforms begun after 2014. To function effectively, however, systema requires political leadership that is accepted by society. The dramatic fall in Zelenskyy’s approval ratings between mid-2019 and early 2020, subsequently magnified by the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, carries dangers for systema’s main players. Zelenskyy’s reduced popularity could easily translate into a loss of authority and trigger new elections – although at the time of writing there was growing speculation that he may seek to run for a second term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The IMF’s insistence on making financial assistance dependent on enacting specific anti-corruption reforms and other measures, including judicial reform, threatens to change the status quo irreversibly to the disadvantage of systema.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, there is no single body of research available in or outside Ukraine on how systema maintains its grip on power, let alone any detailed prescriptions for how to reduce or break it. The research conducted so far has tended to focus on specific individuals and their businesses, rather than on systema as a whole. The issue defies easy analysis because the numerous networks in operation extend across different economic sectors, and they reach deep within the machinery of the state and influence public opinion via different channels. It is easier to feel the presence of these networks than to see them because they are not just hidden, they are also fluid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how systema functions, the chapter that follows identifies the structure of ownership in four main sectors of the economy – banking, energy, transport and healthcare – and the mechanisms of influence used by the principal players in each to protect and advance their interests. They show a consistent pattern of influence that derives from the pillars on which systema rests. The ability to control the legislative process, deploy media and law enforcement tools, and rely on an amenable government system to implement decisions is clearly visible. However, the example of land reform – an issue that is particularly sensitive for the public, and which is supported by Ukraine’s international partners – suggests that sectors where the largest FIGs are not present are less susceptible to systema’s influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;systema-in-the-banking-energy-transport-and-healthcare-sectors&quot;&gt;Systema in the Banking, Energy, Transport and Healthcare Sectors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ability of big business to control the legislative process, deploy media and law enforcement tools, and rely on an amenable government system to implement decisions is clearly visible across multiple economic sectors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;banking&quot;&gt;Banking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ownership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State-owned institutions today account for around 60 per cent of Ukraine’s banking sector assets. PrivatBank, Oschadbank and Ukreximbank are the biggest, with combined assets exceeding UAH 1 trillion. Close to 20 banks with foreign ownership have combined total assets of over UAH 500 billion, followed by nearly 50 domestically owned banks with total assets worth around UAH 250 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clean-up of the banking sector after 2014, by a reformist team at the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), was far-reaching, and ended a large number of the extensive schemes associated with related-party lending that had operated for many years. Around 100 banks, most now closed, stand accused of siphoning abroad a total of $15 billion of taxpayers’ money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence of systema&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authorities have so far put little effort into recovering these and other funds stolen from the state during the Yanukovych years, and there is evidence to show that parts of systema succeeded in obstructing attempts to do so. Under the Poroshenko administration, not only did the Prosecutor General’s Office fail to take appropriate action; the Deposit Guarantee Fund also dragged its feet, despite its power to initiate civil proceedings against individuals responsible for losses to banks. The president nominates the heads of both agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PrivatBank provides a particularly good example of residual resistance to reforms. It was nationalized in 2016, after the discovery of a $5.5 billion hole in its balance sheet. Its former owners started an unprecedented legal campaign to challenge the nationalization in the courts, initiating hundreds of cases and threatening the credibility of banking sector reform as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NBU’s assault on many of the old schemes for misappropriating public money has met with resistance not just from the former owners of PrivatBank. Parliament’s initial hesitation in 2018 in adopting IMF-backed legislation to establish independent supervisory boards for state banks reportedly demonstrated the power of some of the biggest holders of non-performing loans. These actors were able to lobby parliament from within because they were also sitting MPs. The legislation was, however, eventually approved in July 2018. Subsequently, in early 2020, a small group of MPs tabled 16,000 amendments to a draft law on banking insolvency that was required by the IMF as a condition for future lending. This was clear evidence of the influence of external interest groups that wanted to block legislation intended to prevent the former owners of insolvent banks from regaining control of them. However, the urgent need for IMF support because of the economic problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic undermined their campaign. Parliament passed the legislation, and Zelenskyy signed it into law in May 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign against the NBU’s management in late 2019 and early 2020, and the highly personal targeting of former governor Valeria Hontareva, are reminders that some of the opponents of banking reform are prepared to go to extreme lengths to protect their interests. The listing of Hontareva as a suspect in a criminal case ostensibly unconnected with PrivatBank raises suspicions about manipulation of the legal process. Media owned by Kolomoisky and others have played an important role in depicting the NBU as acting against Ukraine’s interests. The NBU issued a statement in November 2019 that held Kolomoisky responsible for attacks on its reputation, including alleged paid-for demonstrations outside its building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2020 Zelenskyy forced the resignation of Yakov Smolii as NBU governor. After leaving his position, Smolii referred to ‘systematic political pressure’ on the bank, and did not rule out a coincidence of interest between the President’s Office and Kolomoisky. He said that the President’s Office wanted to replace the NBU’s leadership with people it could control. Smolii’s resignation came shortly after Ukraine had received the first tranche of a new $5 billion IMF stand-by arrangement. A key condition for continued IMF support was the independence of the NBU, and the IMF had made it clear that it held Smolii and his team in high regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy&quot;&gt;Energy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ownership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy sector has been the source of the largest rents in Ukraine over the past nearly three decades. For this reason, energy companies form the foundation of the business empires of many of the country’s wealthiest business figures. For example, Rinat Akhmetov remains the biggest player in the coal industry. In 2017, his company DTEK accounted for 86 per cent of Ukraine’s total production of 28 million tonnes of thermal coal. Akhmetov also has interests in the production of gas and renewables, as well as in electricity production and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence of systema&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major FIGs exercised powerful influence over the energy industry from the time of the Kuchma presidency (1994–2005) until 2014 – particularly over arrangements for the supply of gas, which favoured imported gas from Russia over domestic production. Illegal arbitrage schemes exploiting the difference between subsidized gas prices for households and market prices for industry were a source of enrichment for large sections of the ruling class. Gas traders ‘captured’ the national regulator to create this differential. Such practices not only distorted the gas market and discouraged households from restricting consumption; they also had profound national security implications by creating a dangerous dependency on Russian gas. By 2014, Naftogaz had amassed a deficit equivalent to 5.7 per cent of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gravity of the situation brought about the most serious reversal of a FIG’s influence seen so far. The reforms undertaken at Naftogaz led to the cessation of gas supplies from Russia, the removal of the previous arbitrage margins and a dramatic improvement, through corporate governance reforms, in the transparency of the company’s dealings. By common consent, the biggest loser of these reforms was Dmytro Firtash, who not only no longer had access to cheap Russian gas but also could no longer profit from the arbitrage business. Even so, he retained control of most of Ukraine’s regional gas companies, a part of the sector still considered highly opaque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if Firtash could no longer shape the gas sector to the same extent as before, another group was able to dictate policy in the coal and electricity sectors. In 2016, the National Energy Regulatory Commission (NERC) took the controversial decision to set wholesale electricity prices at levels favouring domestic coal producers, following the ‘Rotterdam +’ formula that favoured Akhmetov’s DTEK. Commentators viewed this as the product of a reconciliation between Akhmetov and President Poroshenko, after a deterioration in relations between the two following the Revolution of Dignity. In return for NERC’s decision, it seems that Akhmetov offered Poroshenko the support of MPs loyal to him. Akhmetov’s main business partner, Vadim Novinsky, and several of the senior managers in his companies entered parliament in 2014 as representatives of Opposition Bloc, a remnant of Yanukovych’s Party of the Regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secretariat of the Energy Community was scathing in its 2018 review of the NERC’s performance, noting that its members were apparently ‘under the pressure of certain political and business groups which actually influence the outcome of the decisions’. The resignations of several members of the NERC after Zelenskyy became president reportedly took place under political pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is still too early to say whether the NERC will function differently with its changed membership, it seems likely that the same lobbying tactics on the part of the FIGs will continue. The core problem that weakens the possibility for independent regulation is a shortage of expertise and the absence a cadre of specialists who can stand up to business interests. This is particularly visible in the Ministry of Energy and Environmental Protection and in parliament’s Energy and Utilities Committee. The greatest energy expertise is not in the public sector; instead, it is in the FIGs, where salaries are much higher and there are better opportunities for professional development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planned efforts to de-monopolize household gas supply, for example, are likely to run up against Firtash’s interests. As he demonstrated after 2014, he was able to deploy powerful lobbying capacity to protect his businesses. The embargoes on fertilizers produced in Russia helped his company Ostchem to reinforce its monopoly on the domestic market. The cessation of imports from Russia disadvantaged Ukrainian farmers by denying them access to cheaper fertilizer supplies. However, Zelenskyy’s imposition of sanctions on Firtash in late June 2021 suggested that his position had weakened significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The core problem that weakens the possibility for independent regulation is a shortage of expertise and the absence a cadre of specialists who can stand up to business interests.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If necessary, the FIGs are also able to use the media to support their position against the government, as well as funding friendly trade associations or Ukrainian and foreign think-tanks. They have also successfully used the courts in the past to challenge NERC decisions on tariffs. There has been speculation, too, that the blocking of efforts by the Honcharuk government to change the management of Centrenergo and three regional energy companies was a key factor in its dismissal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During 2020, there was significant political pressure on Naftogaz and the gas transmission system operator that was unbundled at the beginning of the year. The deep reforms of the gas sector to cut energy dependence on Russia and align Ukraine’s gas market with the free-market principles enshrined in EU energy legislation have helped the country to integrate rapidly into a wider EU market, but they have not been popular in some quarters in Ukraine. In May of that year, 47 MPs from former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko’s Fatherland party and Medvedchuk’s Russia-friendly Opposition Platform – For Life jointly called on the Constitutional Court to examine the legality of the unbundling of the transmission system. The government’s decision, in January 2021, to regulate household gas prices for the rest of the heating season may have had an economic justification to limit continued price-gouging by companies associated with Firtash that control 75 per cent of the retail gas market. Yet among the supporters of the government’s move were forces hostile to Western-style reforms and thus happy to damage Ukraine’s relations with the IMF. The fund had previously insisted on Ukraine raising domestic gas prices to market levels as a condition for its continued support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transport&quot;&gt;Transport&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ownership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transport sector is largely state-owned, but provides a stark example of how the interests of major FIGs can distort an SOE’s functioning for their own purposes. Direct losses to the sector from FIG-led schemes amount to an estimated $5 billion per year. Exceptionally, Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) is a private company, owned by offshore entities affiliated with Ihor Kolomoisky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence of systema&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Influence over pricing mechanisms for use of the transport system are crucial for the FIGs that operate commodity-producing businesses. This is particularly visible in the case of the railways. The cheapest and most efficient means of transporting bulk commodities such as coal, iron ore, steel, corn, wheat and sunflower oil is by rail, in part because of the unsatisfactory quality of roads. However, the FIGs’ strategy of driving down costs for rail use has left the railways in a deplorable state. Poorly maintained infrastructure and a shortage of rolling stock, particularly locomotives, have created costly bottlenecks for the system as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIGs have succeeded in keeping in place a system of tariffs established in the 1960s that makes it cheaper to transport raw materials than finished goods. As a result of hryvnia depreciation, tariffs are 10 times lower than their equivalents in Poland or Hungary. According to one analysis, the main beneficiaries of the tariffs are SCM (owned by Rinat Akhmetov) and Ferrexpo (owned by Kostyantin Zhevago).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FIGs have also profited from their participation in tenders to supply goods, fuel and maintenance services to Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia). For example, Akhmetov’s Metinvest supplies rails, while Viktor Pinchuk’s Interpipe is a supplier of wheels for locomotives and rail cars. Companies connected with Petro Poroshenko and his associate Ihor Kononenko have supplied fuel. In some cases, business interests have hijacked certification procedures within Ukrzaliznytsia to allow only purchases from monopoly suppliers. A company connected with Yaroslav Dubnevych, the former chairman of parliament’s Transport Committee is alleged to have supplied components to Ukrzaliznytsia at inflated prices. In October 2019 parliament revoked Dubnevych’s parliamentary immunity, and prosecutors arrested him on suspicion of stealing UAH 93 million through corrupt procurement schemes. He was later released on bail. In April 2020, the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office reported that it was filing charges against Dubnevych and forwarding the case to the High Anti-Corruption Court for review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIGs also exercise influence over the operations of the 13 seaports managed by the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority (USPA) to obtain logistical and other advantages, including customs privileges. The ports are vitally important to these groups for their exports of metals and grain as well as imports of coal and oil products. Access to limited port capacity is a key issue. One analysis notes that the FIGs influence port operations through the law enforcement agencies, MPs and the top management of the USPA. An indication of the latter is that, in 2018, 11 of 13 heads of seaports were ‘acting’ rather than permanent appointments. This is a mechanism used in other areas such as customs to induce officials, concerned for their job security, to be more receptive to certain interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aviation sector, Kolomoisky exercises influence through appointees in the management of Kyiv’s Boryspil airport. As a result, UIA reportedly benefits from privileged conditions there. Although Kolomoisky’s lobbying of the government and legal action were not sufficient to prevent the entry of the low-cost carrier Ryanair into the market, before the COVID-19 crisis his oil products business had benefited from the growth of demand for aviation fuel. Around 30 per cent of the volumes supplied in Ukraine came from Kolomoisky’s Kremenchug refinery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the road-building sector, there are strong suspicions that the interests of FIGs influence decisions at the state agency Ukravtodor to favour their businesses by determining which roads should be built, the routes these should take, and which roads should be prioritized for repair. In addition, according to one report, in 2018 and 2019, three companies won one-third of all contracts from Ukravtodvor, one of them allegedly connected with the mayor of Odesa, Hennady Trukhanov, who has been subject to multiple investigations by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau related to suspected embezzlement of state property, money laundering and other offences. None of these has so far resulted in a criminal conviction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;healthcare&quot;&gt;Healthcare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ownership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The healthcare market is competitive, with no single company accounting for more than 6 per cent. The largest FIGs are absent from the sector. The owners of healthcare companies are often significant donors to political parties, and have their representatives in parliament’s Public Health Committee. The pharmaceutical sector as a whole accounted for only 1 per cent of GDP in 2018, according to NBU data. This almost certainly explains why it is not a sector that is attractive to the main FIGs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence of systema&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before 2015, manipulation of the tendering process through collusion between government officials and companies supplying equipment and medicines led to purchases at vastly inflated prices. The two sides shared the proceeds. In some cases the prices were two to three times higher than those paid for the same medicines in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to one 2017 estimate, 40 per cent of the Ministry of Health’s spending on procurement of medicines was ‘black cash’. In 2014, six companies, four of them controlled by the same person, supplied 95 per cent of the drugs for treating AIDS, cancer, hepatitis and tuberculosis. Under the leadership of Ulana Suprun as acting minister from 2016 to 2019, the Ministry of Health succeeded in closing down much of the space for these practices by outsourcing the procurement of medicines to international specialists. Manipulation of the process for registering medicines produced abroad in favour of domestic manufacturers and distributors was another major problem confronting Suprun’s team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The backlash from the interest groups that lost out because of the removal of these schemes was immediate and sustained. Representatives of the Accounting Chamber visited the Ministry of Health on several occasions to investigate the new procurement process. Government agencies suddenly also showed an interest, including the Security Service, the Prosecutor General’s Office and the National Police. Parliament’s Public Health Committee contained several individuals who were on the payroll of pharmaceutical companies. Glib Zahoriy, the owner of one of the largest such companies, Darnitsa, was an MP from Poroshenko’s party. He lobbied against changes to the procurement process in parliament and tried unsuccessfully to appoint a close associate to head the State Expert Centre that was responsible for registering medicines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there were intense media attacks on Suprun and her team as well as efforts using the Prosecutor General’s Office to intimidate two prominent health reform NGOs by opening criminal cases against them for alleged mismanagement of foreign grants. In February 2019, a Kyiv court instructed the State Bureau of Investigations to open a criminal case against Suprun for interfering in the work of the court. She has said that at one point, her team faced up to 20 court appearances a week that was part of an effort to waste their time and slow down the reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current chairman of parliament’s Public Health Committee is Mykhaylo Radutsky, the former owner of the Boris network clinics, who was elected on the Zelenskyy’s Servant of the People list. Due to his close relationship with the president, he reportedly received carte blanche from the President’s Office to reform the health service. According to some sources, Radutsky was in effect running the Ministry of Health at the beginning of 2020. In addition, an alliance of pharmaceutical companies and distributors lobbied the government not to extend the system for outsourcing procurement of medicines to international agencies that was due to end in 2020. Their efforts failed as a result of a dispute between the Ministry of Health and its own procurement agency that required the government to call again on the services of international partners at the beginning of 2021, amid urgent efforts to procure vaccines against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s procurement practices during the COVID-19 pandemic point to efforts to bypass the Prozorro electronic auctions system to purchase protective equipment for medical staff. This has resulted in the state paying more than double the cost than in other countries for equipment meeting the same quality standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, Zelenskyy convened a meeting in March 2020 with the country’s leading business owners and demanded their financial assistance and other support in providing urgently needed medical supplies. This was recognition that the government had neither the financial nor the organizational resources to manage the crisis on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;agriculture-a-counterexample&quot;&gt;Agriculture: A Counterexample&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite the size and influence of Ukraine’s major agro-holdings, the politically sensitive issue of land reform has exposed some of their weaknesses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ownership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agriculture is an exceptional case in Ukraine, in that it is a large sector of the economy not controlled by the top-tier business interests that dominate sectors such as banking, energy, metals and transport. Agricultural lands used for commercial farming are held by private individuals in the form of communal property. Commercial farmers lease these and operate at the level of large agro-holdings, mid-sized farms and small farms, with around 50,000 legally registered entities active in the agricultural sector. In addition, there are an estimated 1–4 million unregistered small farms cultivating around a third to half of the country’s arable land (up to 20 million hectares). These have no access to state subsidies or bank finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reluctance of successive governments to permit the free purchase and sale of agricultural land has favoured the development of large agro-holdings controlling 50,000 hectares and more in the absence of a legal limit on the amount of land they can lease. Some have been able to secure access to land on decades-long leases. Even though the agro-holdings control less than 25 per cent of Ukraine’s agricultural lands, they have exercised decisive influence on legislation, market rules and lease prices, as well on prices for commodities and equipment. These companies include Astarta, Kernel, MHP, Salic (formerly Mriya) and UkrLandFarming. Typically, companies of this size have strong relationships with regional authorities because of their importance as employers and taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sector blighted by ‘corporate raiding’, the big companies have their own security guards but often work closely with local law enforcement agencies to protect their assets – and in some cases to increase their land holdings by using various tactics to put other farmers out of business. At the national level, they also have significant lobbying capacity. One of the best-known examples is that of Vitaly Khomutynnik, a shareholder in Kernel and a member of parliament’s Tax Committee at the time when, in 2018, it pushed through VAT legislation favouring Kernel and other companies in the oilseed-crushing business. The founder of Kernel, Andriy Verevsky, was an MP for over 10 years up to 2013, and served on parliament’s Agriculture Committee until forced to step down because of a conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In a sector blighted by ‘corporate raiding’, the big companies have their own security guards but often work closely with local law enforcement agencies to protect their assets – and in some cases to increase their land holdings by using various tactics to put other farmers out of business.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite the size and influence of the agro-holdings, the issue of land reform has exposed some of their weaknesses. This became clear after the IMF signalled that ending the moratorium on the sale of agricultural land would be a precondition for a new support programme. Up to that point, the large agro-holdings were happy with the status quo, and in some cases actively discouraged reform, sometimes using the media to harness public support. Oleksii Mushak, Verevsky’s cousin and the then prime minister Oleksiy Honcharuk’s adviser on land reform, was an advocate of the most liberal version of the law to allow foreign ownership of land, a provision that favoured large companies such as Kernel because of their ownership structure. Faced with a popular backlash against concentrated ownership of land, including by foreign entities, the government was forced to retreat. It ultimately proposed a version of the law that favoured the interests of the operators of small farms (up to 100 hectares) over the biggest companies. Parliament adopted a new version of the bill in a second reading without revisions of substance and Zelenskyy signed it into law. Some observers consider that the government chose to disregard the lobbying of big business because of the sensitivity of the issue with the public and fear that it could have a negative impact on upcoming local elections. Others point to the risk that some of the large companies may succeed in persuading lessors that they are better off leasing land than selling it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The land reform issue is an important example of how dominant business interests were unable to win the day in a sector in which the biggest FIGs, with their lobbying and media tools, are absent. Although the law adopted is not as liberal as some reformers had hoped, the pressure of the IMF and the strength of public feeling proved more important for the government than any gains it may have received by supporting the position of the agro-holdings. Ultimately, these business groups do not command the same level of authority as the main FIGs which – with their representatives in government and parliament as well as their media channels – have far greater resources to influence decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-place-of-the-media-in-systema&quot;&gt;The Place of the Media in Systema&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The financial-industrial groups’ dominance of Ukraine’s main media outlets – and their ability to subsidize their losses – ‘captures’ politicians who rely on media access to develop the profile needed to win votes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control of the mainstream media is critically important for the biggest stakeholders in systema because of its political power. The largest FIGs are the dominant players in the media market. Four groups own the 15 most popular nationwide television channels, as well as the most popular newspapers, radio stations, regional TV channels and internet media sources. They are StarLight Media (owned by Viktor Pinchuk), Media Group Ukraine (owned by Rinat Akhmetov), 1+1 Media (owned by Ihor Kolomoisky, Viktor Medvedchuk and Ihor Surkis), Inter Media Group (owned by Dmytro Firtash, Valeriy Khoroshkovskii and Serhiy Lyovochkin). According to one estimate, these groups together reach over 75 per cent of Ukraine’s TV audience. Ownership in the sector has experienced a remarkable degree of stability over the past decade. During this time, the top 10 media owners (by size of audience) have remained almost unchanged. This is a powerful indicator of systema’s durability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FIGs’ ownership of the main media outlets and their ability to subsidize their losses – for example, Inter lost $70 million in 2012 – ‘captures’ politicians who rely on media access to develop the profile required to attract voters. This relationship leads to inevitable politicization of media coverage, particularly during election campaigns, and provides a platform to challenge unwelcome reform efforts. Elected politicians also seek to use media to maintain voters’ trust. Political advertising, especially on TV, consumes a large part of campaign budgets because of its perceived effectiveness, and contributes to a distortion of the media market in favour of FIGs’ interests. There are currently no restrictions on campaign spending on advertising. Media owners are also able to use their outlets to protect their businesses from competitors and politicians, particularly during pre-election campaigns when they can shape national news reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some regional centres, subsidiaries of the major FIGs or local business groups have stakes in local media and exercise influence over coverage in the same way as happens at national level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suspilne, the public broadcaster launched in 2015, is starting to make inroads into the audiences of FIG-controlled media as the quality of its programming has improved, but it cannot compete with their offering. There are signs, too, that it is suffering from political interference and underfunding that limit its effectiveness. Similarly, independent media are in no position to match the major channels’ ability to attract advertising for television and digital channels. FIGs also have a strong presence in the digital media sector, where they own three of the top 10 news websites (in terms of audience reach: obozrevatel.com, segodnya.ua and tsn.ua).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government regulation of the media remains open to political influence. The president and parliament appoint, by equal quotas, the members of the regulator, the National Council of Television and Radio Broadcasting. Similarly, the president nominates the head of the licensing body, the State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting, and parliament approves the appointment. The draft media law that has been under discussion in parliament since early 2020, and which had not yet had its first reading at the time of writing this paper, is the work of several individuals in government and parliament connected with media groups controlled by the FIGs. It is hardly surprising that the major media companies have no need to lobby against its provisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, the FIGs’ dominance of the major media channels remains unchallenged. Over time, a combination of regulatory changes, digital disruption, and the appearance of new channels and new models of media business may erode their influence. For example, increased transparency of ownership and funding of digital media, as envisaged by the draft law, could make it harder to use digital media for political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dismantling Ukraine’s system of crony capitalism will require a combination of deep structural reforms, preventive and repressive measures to restrict corruption, and civic activism to hold politicians, officials and business owners accountable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systema as whole in Ukraine has suffered setbacks since the Revolution of Dignity, but it still has considerable residual strength – and the ability to undo some of the most important achievements of the reforms undertaken since 2014. Its four pillars of support provide possibilities for using different mechanisms in different combinations and at different intensity to advance its interests. The greatest disruption to the interests of systema stakeholders has been in the banking, energy and healthcare sectors. Yet in all three cases, there are clear dangers of regression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reformist forces have not yet achieved a final victory against the former owners of PrivatBank, as underlined by the resignation of the NBU governor in July 2020, and by the fact that the Constitutional Court is due to rule on the legality of the Deposit Guarantee Fund. This fund is responsible for liquidating insolvent bank assets. If its creation is ruled unconstitutional, this will call into question the entire clean-up of the banking sector during the Poroshenko years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrest of the former deputy CEO of PrivatBank in February 2021, as he tried to flee the country, suggests that the net may be tightening around Ihor Kolomoisky and his associates, particularly as the US authorities imposed sanctions against Kolomoisky for ‘significant corruption’ shortly after. However, there are also serious concerns about the independence of the national gas transmission operator MGU and the oil and gas company Ukrnafta. There are fears, too, that corporate governance reform could further regress, particularly given the summary dismissal of the CEO of Naftogaz, Andriy Kobolev, in April 2021. To enable his removal from office, the government temporarily suspended the company’s supervisory board, all members of which subsequently resigned in protest at this blatant manoeuvre. The decision by Ukrnafta’s supervisory board, in May 2020, to cancel the process for the independent selection of a new CEO was also discouraging. Signs that the big players in the pharmaceutical industry are positioning themselves to reverse changes in the procurement system in their favour are a disturbing reminder of the institutional weakness of parts of government and their susceptibility to manipulation by narrow interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the agriculture sector appears to offer an example where reform in an area that is particularly sensitive for the public, and which is supported by Ukraine’s international partners, can limit the lobbying capacity of large companies. In this case, too, the IMF made its $8 billion loan package conditional on land reform, among other requirements. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the largest FIGs, and their lobbying capacity, are not present in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the stranglehold of the largest FIGs on the media remains the critical factor that preserves the fusion of business and political interests. For example, Zelenskyy could not have launched himself as a presidential candidate without Kolomoisky’s 1+1 channel showing his ‘Servant of the People’ series. At the same time, he and the government depend on favourable media coverage to maintain their authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reform of the judicial system and the law enforcement agencies has suffered significant difficulties, partly because of internal resistance and institutional capacity but mainly because of the interest of systema in maintaining the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Reform of the judicial system and the law enforcement agencies has suffered significant difficulties.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, Ukraine has shown that it has a very active and increasingly capable civil society, and that its population respects democratic values. The 2020 Ukraine in World Values Survey found that more citizens want a greater say in important government decisions today than was the case in 2011. At the same time, large shares of the population perceive state authorities (72.2 per cent) and civil service providers (67.1 per cent) as corrupt. This points to the resilience of systema. Critically, the electorate still has to confront the fundamental issue of why its leaders govern for the few, not the many. Civil society’s focus has been on addressing problems created by systema, and limiting its capacity in certain areas rather than on dismantling it. However, some parts of civil society are starting to consider the problem more broadly. Low standards of living, poor public services and stubbornly high levels of petty corruption are problems largely created by the overall model of governance and the incomplete state of reforms. Zelenskyy’s electoral success in 2019 and the election at that time of a large number of first-time MPs suggest that parts of society are genuinely seeking change. However, the lack of real political parties rooted in society and committed to deep reforms does not allow the translation of these aspirations into reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Revolution of Dignity, Ukraine has enjoyed unprecedented attention and assistance from its Western allies. The EU and other major donors as well as international financial institutions (particularly the IMF, the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) helped to launch important structural reforms by using their political leverage to impose conditionality. The EU has deployed many of the tools it has used successfully in Central Europe to promote good governance and the rule of law, as part of an overall process of political association and ‘legal approximation’ enshrined in the Association Agreement signed with Ukraine in 2014. Weak state capacity explains in part the limited progress on implementing the agreement, but there appear to be other reasons too. Efforts to improve the quality of regulations and their implementation by strengthening the regulatory authorities have, in some cases, been undermined because systema’s major players do not see the benefits and have the capacity to resist change through their influence on lawmaking and government decision-making. For example, despite long-standing efforts supported by the EU and other donors to give it teeth, the Anti-Monopoly Committee (AMCU) still requires further reform to enforce competition rules, including stronger safeguards to ensure its independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelenskyy appeared to side with systema in the spring of 2020 when he criticized the number of foreigners on supervisory boards of state companies, and in pushing for the resignation of the head of AMCU. Some observers have suggested that an alliance of forces associated with Kolomoisky and Medvedchuk as well as former prime minister Tymoshenko is working to reverse the progress made on corporate governance in state companies. Amos Hochstein, a US businessman, resigned from the supervisory board of Naftogaz in October 2020, alleging ‘sabotage’ of its good governance reforms by the government and ‘oligarchs’ seeking to enrich themselves. Shortly before this, the highly regarded Swedish economist and Eastern Europe expert Anders Åslund had similarly resigned from the supervisory board of the national railway company, claiming that the working conditions of supervisory board members had been made impossible, and that Zelenskyy and his ‘loud MPs’ do not believe in good corporate governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By June 2021, however, after the Ukrainian authorities had introduced sanctions against Medvedchuk’s assets in February and placed him under house arrest on charges including treason, Zelenskyy felt sufficiently emboldened to table draft legislation to curb the influence of big business on politics and the economy. He threatened to hold a referendum on the issue if parliament failed to support the new law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge of reining in systema goes much deeper than forcing the wealthiest businesspeople to declare their assets and disclose their contacts with officials as the draft law intends. Systema has left Ukraine with a serious lack of expertise in government that contributes to weak state capacity. The major FIGs attract and retain much of the best talent in the country, putting it to work to make governing institutions work for them. This imbalance is likely to take many years to correct. The EU’s considerable efforts to encourage public administration reform will inevitably take time to produce results because of the long-term nature of change programmes of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, efforts by Western donors to promote rule of law and anti-corruption initiatives through measures such as strengthening of regulatory bodies, judicial reform and the creation of new investigative and prosecutorial agencies, as well as the requirement for unprecedented levels of transparency of assets held by officials, have so far produced only modest results. This is not surprising, since the experience of transition in Central European countries has shown that reforms in these areas are typically met with strong resistance and require considerable effort over many years. However, there have also been clear examples of success on the anti-corruption front, including the cleaning up of Naftogaz and reforms in administrative services, banking, the patrol police, procurement and taxation. Decentralization has also created new opportunities for citizens to hold local authorities accountable for managing public resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the importance of accountability for high-level corruption crimes in an effort to promote the rule of law, Ukraine’s international partners have placed heavy emphasis on establishing new anti-corruption bodies, including the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office and the High Anti-Corruption Court. NABU and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office have suffered from the absence of a properly functioning judicial system, and NABU has come under increasing political pressure from systema interests concerned about its investigations. Judicial reform conducted in parallel has encountered obstruction from within the judiciary itself. As a small ‘island’ surrounded by hostile systema interests, the anti-corruption infrastructure developed since 2014 is likely to face further efforts to limit its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a risk that some forces could try to use the anti-corruption infrastructure to conduct politically motivated investigations and prosecutions against rivals. It will be important for Ukraine’s international partners to monitor developments closely, and to step in if necessary to protect the independence of these institutions. The country has bitter experience of politicized justice from the Yanukovych years. Efforts by opponents to bring criminal charges against Poroshenko through the Prosecutor’s Office are an indication that this risk is real. Oversight by its international partners remains essential at this stage of the reforms when rule of law is weak and Ukraine has still to develop a set of reliable checks and balances for investigative and prosecutorial bodies to function without abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A vicious circle is at work: the largest FIGs have a clear interest in ensuring that they can continue to enjoy access to rents and limit competition, since most of them do not have another business model.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systema has also retained the capacity to fight against measures designed to improve the law enforcement agencies and free the courts from external interference, because the reforms conducted so far in other areas have not weakened it at its core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reforms that have most heavily affected systema’s interests are those that have closed down major schemes for diverting public funds. In the case of the banking and gas sectors, there was a national security imperative to do so. The healthcare sector was different: a determined reform team at the Ministry of Health successfully faced down the pharmaceutical industry with the backing of Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman as well as Western governments and the international organizations that took over procurement of medicines and delivered huge savings. The owners of the pharmaceutical companies and distributors did not have the institutional strength at the time to cancel these measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operation of the electronic public procurement platform Prozorro, developed by civil society and reformers in government together with business, has helped to close down well-established corruption schemes that were prevalent in the Yanukovych era. Punitive measures are also a necessary means to deter corrupt practices and must accompany efforts to restrict the space for corruption, although they must not become a substitute for other efforts to reduce systema’s influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vicious circle is at work: the largest FIGs have a clear interest in ensuring that they can continue to enjoy access to rents and limit competition, since most of them do not have another business model. To do so, they have an incentive to remain politically connected and maintain control of the media to shape the political agenda and influence the execution of government policy. For their part, a large number of politicians and senior officials have an interest in continuing to benefit as the FIGs’ enablers. In turn, the layers of bureaucracy below them have a strong incentive to continue operating the machinery that keeps the system functioning because they receive income from the corruption that it spawns. Consequently, the instigators and enablers of rent seeking have an interest in limiting their accountability before the law. This clearly places a serious brake on judicial reform and the establishment of reliable courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-can-ukraines-international-partners-do&quot;&gt;What can Ukraine’s international partners do?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other countries that have attempted fundamental governance reform can provide useful reference points for thinking about what may limit the power of systema in Ukraine. For example, South Korea’s successful experience of reducing the influence of its chaebols and Chile’s exceptional achievements in becoming one of the least corrupt countries in Latin America deserve attention. There is also much relevant experience closer to home: in Bulgaria, Greece and Romania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no universal model for achieving a transition from a ‘limited access order’ whereby rent seeking is the norm to a politically and economically competitive ‘open access order’ where the needs of society come first. Every country is different, and progress may sometimes be the by-product of other changes rather than the direct result of reform measures. Antitrust legislation can over time be part of a framework to create a competitive economic environment, but it cannot be a solution on its own to addressing the wider problem of systema, particularly when Ukraine lacks an independent judiciary and other institutions that could enforce new rules. A combination of deep structural reforms, preventive and repressive measures to restrict corruption, and civic activism to hold politicians, officials and business owners accountable are necessary to address the problem as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general principle, reducing the influence of systema requires changing the calculus of the main players. Rent seeking needs to become more difficult, to carry greater risk and to be less profitable than wealth creation through the establishment of well-managed, transparent businesses that attract investment and generate employment. Economic growth will then create new players and diversify the asset-owning class. The reduced appeal of rent seeking will encourage greater political competition through the diversification of constituencies. Regulating further the use of media for electoral campaigning purposes and developing a properly resourced independent public broadcaster could be part of this process, along with further efforts to regulate and control campaign financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some systema interests may be strengthened, and others weakened, as the economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic plays out. Some FIGs may find themselves rewarded by the government for their support, while others may lose ground because of the conditions of future IMF support. It is notable that during the ‘lockdown’ period from March to May 2020, large companies were able to continue working, while small and medium-sized business could not. FIGs and their affiliates benefited, as did their employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privatization of state companies, and improving the corporate governance of the remaining ones, offers considerable opportunities to reduce traditional rent seeking and force some of the FIGs to reconsider their business models. However, this presupposes that the process of privatization is competitive, and not prone to the type of insider dealing seen in the past. The possibility, under legislation adopted in March 2018, to apply English law to large-scale privatization sale and purchase agreements is an encouraging development in view of the failure so far to improve the delivery of justice in Ukrainian commercial courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judicial reform is a long-term process that requires sustained support from Ukraine’s international partners, but with their acceptance that the principles of the Council of Europe do not easily translate into local reality. The attempt to respect the principle of judicial independence by leaving the unreformed High Council of Justice in charge of the reform process has produced predictably meagre results. International support to civil society and investigative journalists should continue, since they play an important watchdog role in monitoring reforms – for example, by exposing the rigging of judicial appointments and drawing attention to disciplinary proceedings in the case of allegations of malfeasance. The international partners must distinguish between cosmetic and substantial reform of the judiciary. A reminder of the state of the judicial system is that Kolomoisky’s defence against claims by state-owned PrivatBank looks much weaker in foreign jurisdictions than it does in Ukraine. International partners also need to tie financial and other support to real judicial reform. Strict IMF and EU conditionality made it possible to create the new anti-corruption infrastructure, and should make it possible to conduct deep judicial reform. Ukraine is likely to need significant financial support over the next two years to service its foreign debt and cope with the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis and a shortage of foreign investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s international partners must distinguish between cosmetic and substantial reform of the judiciary.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most powerful tool for challenging systema is the greater part of Ukrainian society that does not benefit from it nor from preserving the status quo. Sustained calls by the public to stop specific rent-seeking practices will put pressure on the FIGs and their enablers in government and parliament. An alliance of reformist politicians, business figures and civil society has the potential to play an important role in this process, but only if backed with appropriate support by Ukraine’s international partners. Dismantling systema and replacing it with robust, competent institutions will be a long-term process that is unlikely to be linear because of the political battles that will need to be fought along the way, and because of the need to co-opt the progressive-minded part of the elite that sees the need to look beyond maintaining the status quo. To drive this effort, civil society will need to broaden its capabilities and expand beyond the biggest cities, while the public must have better access to balanced reporting via independent media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Western countries must show much greater resolve to investigate suspected money laundering by the beneficiaries of rent seeking and corruption in Ukraine. There is abundant evidence of the latter’s ability to use banks in EU countries and in the UK to buy real estate, educate their children and protect their assets in rule-of-law jurisdictions. Some of these individuals bear heavy responsibility for Ukraine’s weak institutions and the national security problem that they have created. Continued failure to deter these practices will not only sustain systema. It will also increasingly lead to accusations of Western double standards and tarnish the EU’s image in Ukraine as a community of law-governed states that is genuinely committed to upholding democratic values and supporting reform in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-introduction-to-strategic-misfortunes&quot;&gt;An Introduction to Strategic Misfortunes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategy is a concept that is exceptionally easy to understand – on paper that is. In practice, it remains notoriously difficult to execute. We know this because of the wealth of knowledge contained within the history of warfare – or if one chooses, throughout strategic history. Yet, precisely what is this high concept? What does it mean and what is its role? After all, these are questions that must be answered, however briefly, before one can begin to understand any misfortune in the function of Strategy. If we turn to history’s greatest military theorist, the Prussian General Carl von Clausewitz, we understand that Strategy is the “use of the engagement for the purpose of the war”. In Clausewitz’s definition, “engagement” ultimately implies violence and “purpose” denotes the political condition and/or political behavior being sought. Today, one may prefer to use a definition of Strategy proffered in more modern wording: “Strategy refers to the use made of force and the threat of force for the ends of policy. It is the bridge that connects policy with military power.” Though separated by 175 years, ultimately both definitions speak to the very same meaning and role of Strategy: it is an activity, deportment, or even response concerned with the linkage of violence to political purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of warfare has provided posterity with a treasure chest of examples where military leaders devised and executed Strategy with sheer excellence. For one example, we can turn to the Battle of Marathon, which, with great thanks to historians such as Hans Delbrück, we now have a clearer understanding of the events that took place in this ancient battle. It was in the Vrana Valley in 490 B.C.E. that Miltiades and his hoplite forces defeated the invading Persians. He was able to accomplish this through, among others, a combination of his brilliant understanding of the terrain; the force deployment of his Athenian hoplites aimed at opposing Persian cavalry and their formidable archers prior to the battle; and in how he managed to utilize his forces in order to counter attacks to their flanks once violence began. The purpose of the engagement was simple. Miltiades and his hoplites accepted battle with the Persians for the maintenance of the security of Athens, and arguably, Greece at large. This was a display of Strategy at its finest. Brilliant lessons in Strategy aside – let alone Strategy that has been executed “good enough” – arguably, they are not equivalent to the strategic misfortunes found throughout strategic history, including contemporary and current times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of strategic misfortunes is long and bloody, too long to be listed even in a special edition dedicated to the subject. However, a few examples are necessary in order to bring forth a clear understanding of the purpose of this edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While historical accounts and records of wars may be incomplete and slanted, the end result of wars cannot be. We know who won and we know who lost. As concerns strategic history, it is chock full of strategic misfortunes found within the conduct of war. A strategic misfortune can imply anything from difficulty to outright failure in linking “ends” and “means” via “ways”. Moreover, failure in the function of Strategy need not occur within one instance of fighting – it can actually be a long and drawn out process. For example, and again turning to the chronicles of strategic history, in 216 B.C.E. General Hannibal of Carthage defeated one Roman army (possibly up to 50,000 dead Romans and Italians) at the Battle of Cannae within the spate of a day. Yet, despite such a tactical achievement, Hannibal failed strategically. He subsequently occupied parts of Italy for over a dozen years and never succeeded in turning his battlefield achievements or military occupation of Italy into positive political effect for Carthage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contemporary historical times, Napoleon is a prime candidate for strategic misfortunes. Despite the French Emperor’s numerous tactical successes, Napoleon racked up an abundance of strategic failures spread across the European continent, and beyond, throughout his rule. Similar to Hannibal, he could never turn his bloody triumphs into positive political achievements for the French Empire. Such failures effectively ensured that every battle won ultimately mattered little, at least for the maintenance of the French Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In World War I, volumes could be written on the strategic misfortunes that took place in Europe alone. In 1914, the German General Staff’s “Schlieffen Plan” quickly turned into a massive strategic failure for Germany, placing pressure on the entire German armed forces. As a result of, among others, amendments to the original German plan, the unexpected speed at which the Russians were able to organize and deploy, and the French ability to mount a counterattack, culminating in the Battle of the Marne, Germany’s initial political aims were quickly lost. In what was expected to be a rapid victory against France, events morphed into years of so-called trench warfare and ultimately, in the defeat of the German Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, and despite knowledge that the history of warfare has provided, strategic failure continues unabated. Strategic misfortunes have permeated numerous conflicts since the 1980s – from the Soviets in Afghanistan, the Argentinians in the Falklands War, the US and French in Lebanon, Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, the US and international forces in Somalia in 1993, United Nations’ forces in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, to the Israel Defense Force in the Second Lebanon War in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how and what can we learn from both historical and current strategic failures that will assist in the future? Answering these questions through the examples provided in the following articles is the purpose of this Infinity Journal Special Edition. In this edition, six individuals have written on a wide range of topics that do not simply point out the strategic failures that have occurred, but perhaps more importantly, why they happened. It is from these writings that we must learn and subsequently apply lessons if one desires to avoid, as best as possible, future strategic misfortune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eminent strategic theorist Professor Colin S. Gray argues that the Luftwaffe’s failure in the summer of 1940 was the direct result of the excellence of RAF Fighter Command, rather than because of its own mistakes, serious though these were. In this Infinity Journal Special Edition article, Gray explains the strategic nature of the German defeat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lt. Col. Dr. Antulio J. Echevarria, II, a world-renowned historian, Clausewitzian scholar, and Director of Research for the U.S. Army War College, argues that Erwin Rommel’s generalship continuously pushed men and materiel to their limits, which precipitously wore down forces that were merely intended to provide security and stability along the flank of the main theater of operations against the Soviet Union. Rommel failed to appreciate the operational interplay between land power and air power – and his forces paid the price at El Alamein.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Defense analyst and lecturer at the Israeli Defense Force Command and General Staff College, Dr. Eado Hecht, holds that adaptation of Israel’s successful strategy to quell Palestinian attacks emanating from neighbouring Arab states to the unique circumstances of Lebanon led to the First Lebanon War in 1982. However, after initial success, the strategy failed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;United States Army Colonel and Director of Military History at West Point, Gian P. Gentile, provides a self-critical assessment of how he came to violate the dictates of being a good historian: he began to think like a social scientist and embraced a model that placed the primacy of strategy over tactics in war. What he found, however, is that history does not always conform to that model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associate Professor and Senior Analyst, Dr. C. Dale Walton, examines US decisions regarding war and peace from the Vietnam War to the present. He finds a disturbing pattern of “anti-Clausewitzian” behavior. Walton argues that the US military is very good at fighting wars, but America’s civilian leaders frequently have misused their military instrument, engaging in ill-conceived adventures without first carefully assessing likely human, financial, and other costs, establishing clear goals, and crafting a realistic roadmap for winning the conflict in a timely fashion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lastly, Adam Elkus, a defense and security analyst and doctoral candidate in international relations, writes that the sheer scale and complexity of the Chinese Civil War belies assertions that today’s substate conflicts are uniquely challenging. Elkus looks at what lessons we can grasp from the complexity and contingency of Mao’s victory and the Nationalists’ strategic misfortune.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;stephen-bungay&quot;&gt;Stephen Bungay&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The most fundamental reason for the German defeat was a failure in strategy. Most of the decisions which determined the outcome of the Battle had been made before it began. Given the defence systems, the aircraft, the training and the plans, all put in place by the decisions of a few people in leadership positions on each side, the odds were stacked heavily against the Luftwaffe from the first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bungay is right in his unequivocal claim, quoted above. But, is it more correct to register the outcome of the Battle of Britain as a failure of strategy on the German part, rather than as a success for British strategy? When scholars and others choose to focus on the behaviour and misbehaviour of only one side to a conflict, balanced judgment is likely to fall victim as a consequence. Clausewitz insists that war is a duel and every PowerPoint presentation on strategy more or less faithfully restates the obvious important truth that the enemy votes on how well we need to do. And yet, somehow, the duelling nature of strategic affairs frequently escapes proper notice and attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one asks ‘why did the Luftwaffe lose the Battle of Britain?’ the question encourages a biasing emphasis upon German performance that is anchored in the fact of defeat. Although the Luftwaffe made many mistakes in the summer of 1940, it would be a serious mistake to attribute its defeat to strategic misfortune – it was not bad luck. Similarly, it would not be useful or persuasive to argue that a different German choice here or there should have made all the difference between defeat and victory. The Luftwaffe failed strategically in summer 1940 because Britain, and especially its Fighter Command, was too good for it in the geostrategic context of the conflict at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, the Germans did not conduct a sufficiently effective campaign against Fighter Command, but it needs to be appreciated that the German weaknesses and errors were not, in the main, misfortunes (i.e. instances of bad luck), rather were they the products of a system that was not capable of fighting with strategic sense. The Battle of Britain in the summer and autumn of 1940 was a struggle that has to be understood as a unity, not only as a German defeat or a British victory (pick one). However, as an exemplary tale of strategy, or its absence, in action, the Battle is much better explained as a British victory than as a German defeat. History records many cases of ‘fighting and winning ugly’, but the evidence of 1940 shows unmistakeably that the Luftwaffe, fighting ugly or not, was never likely to prevail. RAF Fighter Command strictly did not require good fortune in order to win, but one cannot deny that German folly certainly was welcome. The Battle of Britain serves as one of history’s clearest examples of the rewards and the costs of both good and poor strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;theory-and-practice-for-1940&quot;&gt;Theory and Practice for 1940&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an intellectual key to the understanding of strategy that is not difficult to present. Simply stated: a strategy should achieve desired political ends by using appropriate means in effective ways. There are usually good reasons why ends, ways, and means fail to mesh as cooperatively as one would like, but the practical ambition is only to function with strategic sense well enough, not to perform perfectly. In the military realm one has to expect to fight under less than perfect conditions, which is why one should strive to learn from unfolding experience, and be sufficiently flexible as to be able to adapt to unwelcome developments and yet survive and even succeed. Because of its super-reductionist simplicity, the ends, ways, and means formula enables us to test historical experience fairly reliably for strategic sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the strategic trinity just cited one needs to add the intellectually and evidentially challenging factors of assumptions and also of context. The people and the machines of 1940 had to perform in action then, but they were very substantially the products of the circumstances of a British context for homeland air defence that had form from 1916, and of a German context rooted only in 1933 (and then not for an air campaign against Britain at home). The rival air forces had to fight in 1940, but each was made in the preceding years. Most of the RAF’s system and the Luftwaffe’s advantages and disadvantages can be traced to pre-war circumstances and concerns. RAF Fighter Command in 1940 was the product of a fairly consistent focus on homeland air defence traceable back to 1915-16, while the Luftwaffe’s close attention to Britain was a novel phenomenon in the summer of 1940. One side was long prepared for the battle of the day, the other was not. These are facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not wish to employ ends, ways, and means mechanistically in the analysis that follows, but readers are alerted to the value that of this gloriously inclusive yet still taut inherently holistic conceptual trinity. It permeates my argument. Although I will argue that RAF Fighter Command won a well merited strategic victory in 1940, it is necessary also that I explain why the Luftwaffe suffered strategic defeat. I must proceed thus, given the essential unity of strategic experience between rivals and enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preparation-and-battle&quot;&gt;Preparation and Battle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any military force can have a bad day or two, and the reasons for poor combat performance can be many and complex. That said, the history of military aviation shows that air forces tend to fail or succeed for reasons with paper trails over many years. The Battle of Britain was a struggle with two timelines. It mattered critically how effectively the rival air forces fought from July to October 1940, but that net effectiveness was influenced massively by the strategic events of the previous quarter-century. Typically, in popular histories and TV documentaries the strategic tale begins in Flanders in May-June 1940, and then proceeds at a galloping pace from the opening probing ‘round’ over the Channel in July, to the main event (in two or three ‘rounds’) in August and September. All too often, strategically vital differences between RAF Fighter Command and the Luftwaffe pass unflagged. Neglecting the contextual dimension to the air warfare of summer 1940 is probably the most punishing mistake one can make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain, although now we know most everything that there is to be known about the air warfare of 1940, that very familiarity can function unhelpfully as a barrier to our understanding. We have knowledge, but we tend to lack empathy because we do not think about air warfare as people did in 1940. It would be hard to exaggerate the relevance of the strategic historical fact that the Battle of Britain was the first air battle in all of history effectively unconnected to on-going terrestrial warfare. This was an attempt to win well enough in and from the sky, leading either to terrestrial success with brute force in combat, or to political victory as a result of coercion from altitude. Could it be done? More to the point, could the Luftwaffe do it in August-September 1940? No-one knew, and in part they did not know because it had never been tried before, anywhere by anyone. Theory was plentiful, if not abundant, but reliable evidence was lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality of 1940 was that only one air force, the RAF, knew what it had to do and, in principle, how to do it. The Luftwaffe, in contrast, was committed to the world’s first stand-alone air campaign. Moreover, the RAF, and the Royal Flying Corps before it, had been devoted to the strategic mission of homeland air defence since 1915 with some activity, and certainly since 1917 in the most careful detail. British air defence had a track record of considerable success in action in 1916-18,was reorganised twice in the inter-war years, albeit with large continuities, and it was always fit enough for its contemporary purpose – as far as one can judge for peacetime(!) – through the 1920s and 1930s. This is not to deny that there was a brief period in the very early 1920s when the air defence narrative seemed in peril, but this was fixed by 1924 (courtesy of anxiety occasioned by a perceived French air menace). More troubling was the delay in 1937-8 in reequipping with the new fast monoplane fighters, with the Luftwaffe’s Bf109 acquisition being two years in advance of the Hurricane and Spitfire. The Hurricanes were delivered for squadron service in November 1937, Spitfires on 4 August 1938. The Bf109 first flew on 28 May 1935, the Spitfire on 5 March 1936. The new first-generation monoplane Bf109s were fed into the Condor Legion’s war in Spain, but it was untried against a similarly equipped enemy until it met Spitfires over Dunkirk in late May 1940. The point of historical contextual significance, though, is that Britain had ready enough an organisation, peopled, trained, and equipped adequately for the task of the hour, homeland air defence – and Germany did not have sufficiently offsetting advantages on the offensive side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British air defences had defeated three German air campaigns conducted from 1915 to 1918 (2 by Zeppelin airships and one by Gotha aircraft), and then had prepared for the threat that materialised by and in 1940. The Germans had to improvise most aspects of their air campaign against Britain in 1940; the British needed to improvise hardly anything. The Luftwaffe fought with the weapons it had, ones acquired and then employed briefly in relatively short-range continental warfare. This is not to suggest that the Germans could not succeed in the air in 1940, but it is to highlight the abundantly evidenced fact that only one belligerent in 1940 had prepared over time and in depth for an air battle across the Channel over Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The literature on the Battle of Britain is abundant, vastly repetitive, and typically innocent of much strategic sense. There are, however, two exceptional readable yet scholarly studies which tell the story of 1940 as well as one needs to have it told. Without qualification, I recommend Richard Overy’s The Battle of Britain: Myth and Reality (2010), and Stephen Bungay’s The Most Dangerous Enemy: A History of the Battle of Britain (2000). Because of the excellence of the granular histories of the Battle in 1940, I will not waste space with more than a summary of the story arc of the most relevant combat in 1940.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May – June:&lt;/strong&gt; German assault beginning on 10 May routs the French army and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). Most of the BEF (226,000) and some French soldiers (112,000) are evacuated from Dunkirk between 26 May and 4 June. The RAF in France is ineffective, but Fighter Command aircraft from British airfields provide a nasty shock to the Luftwaffe over Dunkirk. The 9 days of air combat associated directly with the Dunkirk operation cost the RAF 177 aircraft to 240 for the Luftwaffe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 July – 11 August:&lt;/strong&gt; The Luftwaffe tries to entice RAF Fighter Command into battle over the Channel. The Germans avoid crossing the Channel and instead probe British air defences by attacking shipping in a rather desultory fashion (the kanalkampf). 10 July – 11 August saw the RAF lose 115 fighters and 64 bombers, these 179 compare with Luftwaffe losses of 216. Both sides learnt from the fighting, but the Germans did not unravel the architecture and operational design of Fighter Command. In order to preserve assets and deny intelligence to the enemy, the Command deliberately limited its reactions to the German campaign against Channel shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12/13 August – 6/7 September:&lt;/strong&gt; This brief period was the main event of the Battle, militarily considered (it included days when flying was either impossible or severely restricted by bad weather). Between these dates the Luftwaffe strove none too consistently to render RAF Fighter Command hors de combat. The Command was attacked directly on its principal airfields (the Luftwaffe was not well informed about dispersion to much rougher satellite fields), and in its specific industrial base (aircraft and engine manufacturing plants). The most vital target set, the coastal radar stations were attacked heavily on 12 August, but very little thereafter (the number of Chain Home and Chain Home Low radar stations grew from 51 in July 1940 to 76 by the end of September that year). The attritional combat was heavy, if somewhat episodic, but Fighter Command survived into early September, damaged but definitely not crippled. The operational air general, Keith Park commanding 11 Group (London and the South East), was not compelled to evacuate his airfields to the south and east of London.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7-15 September:&lt;/strong&gt; Desperate for a more speedy victory than they had achieved thus far, the Germans shifted strategy to bomb British urban targets (in daylight), especially London and its docks. The hope was that RAF Fighter Command would be obliged to ascend in the largest number it could still manage, where it could be attrited in greater numbers than before. This ‘round’ in the Battle, really the final one, concluded on 15 September, when the Luftwaffe sought to darken the sky over London with 965 aircraft (348 bombers and 617 fighters). The scale of the attacks, and the geographic depth of their necessary penetration, allowed Fighter Command the time to assemble a large enough near continuous defence as to inflict immensely demoralising damage on the German bomber crews in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Late September — :&lt;/strong&gt; The daylight ‘Blitz’ principally against London of the 7-15 period, was succeeded by a largely nighttime ‘Blitz’ through the autumn and winter, a campaign to which Fighter Command had no answers at that time (lacking airborne radar in 1940).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hitler officially postponed sine die the planned invasion of Britain (Seelowe) on 17 September 1940.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;explaining-the-defeat&quot;&gt;Explaining the Defeat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did RAF Fighter Command win in 1940? The answer is only two-fold when stated bluntly and minimally: because of Britain’s 25 year record of competent professional attention to homeland air defence, and because of the superior performance of Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding as the strategic leader and military commander of British air defence. The whole story is of course complex and contains as much detail as anyone finds tolerable. However, these two reasons – 25 years of dedicated practice, and Dowding – comprise the heart of the matter. Because my argument is advanced so confidently in praise of the RAF and Dowding, it is only prudent to lead this part of the analysis with a summary of the reasons why Germany lost the Battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;germanys-problems&quot;&gt;Germany’s problems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignorance of the enemy:&lt;/strong&gt; Thinking in German terms of RAF Fighter Command as a target set, it would be difficult to improve on this judgment by Stephen Bungay: “The core problem for Kesselring and Sperrle was that they literally did not know what they were doing.” Luftwaffe intelligence, to ignore the glaring irony, correctly understood little that was vitally significant about Fighter Command. Oberst Beppo Schmid, the catastrophically incompetent head of Luftwaffe Intelligence, persistently underestimated RAF Fighter Command. This goes a long way towards explaining why Luftwaffe morale suffered heavily, following aircrew puzzlement, when their enemy continued resisting into September in numbers not visibly much if at all reduced, despite the cumulatively high ‘kill’ rates claimed. In every aspect of the Battle the Germans were hampered severely by acute, literally lethal, ignorance of the enemy. They knew about British radar, but they did not know how the RAF used it. In fact, Luftwaffe Intelligence had no comprehension of RAF Fighter Command as the world’s first, and then only integrated air defence system. Because the Luftwaffe in 1940 did not centralize its radar data and filtering, it did not occur to them that Fighter Command was truly a network, which is to say a system with integrated sub-systems (thanks to Post Office land lines). A key part of the German ignorance was their lack of comprehension of the existence and role of the 7 Sector Stations that Air Vice Marshal Keith Park was using as instruments of his operational air generalship. Naturally, since the Luftwaffe did not know of what Fighter Command consisted and how it functioned, bombardment for strategic effectiveness – identified by Giulio Douhet as the “most delicate and difficult task in aerial warfare … defined as aerial strategy” – had to be a substantially haphazard affair.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive failure of strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Germany’s political ends did not sit comfortably well enough with its selected ways or its enabling means. In short, Germany needed its Luftwaffe either to assist its navy and army to win the war by a successful invasion, or to coerce the British government by air action alone into acquiescence in German political leadership (which may not have required many German boots on Britain’s green and pleasant land). In failing to suppress the RAF the Luftwaffe effectively thwarted the political ‘end’ of a compliant, possibly even friendly, government in London. The political guidance to the Luftwaffe’s operational level commanders (Generalfeldmarschall Alfred Kesselring – Luftflotte 2, Brussels; Generalfeldmarschall Hugo Sperrle – Luftflotte 3, Paris) was minimal. Indeed, Hitler showed little interest in the air campaign, while Hermann Goring did not function strategically in military perspective).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inadequate military means:&lt;/strong&gt; The Luftwaffe of 1940 was the world-leading air force of the day – it was truly formidable. It had the finest medium, light and dive bombers, and arguably the finest single-seat fighter, the Bf109. However, the Luftwaffe was a relatively short-range force and it was always on the edge of crisis over spare parts and replacement aircrew and aircraft. The service was a near miracle of hasty construction, but it had been built as a Nazi political and cultural showcase, as a coercive instrument against those likely to be easily shaken, and if need be, as a force enhancer of swift terrestrial continental victory. It was not built to be able to sustain and recover from recurring heavy losses, or to fight across seas against an enemy over his home. Numbers are arguable because of the problems of dating the audit and selecting what really were the “serviceable” numbers. Nonetheless, a good enough count for the balance holds that RAF Fighter Command and the Luftwaffe joined serious combat in summer 1940 with orders of battle at approximately 754 Hurricanes and Spitfires in 48 squadrons versus 1,107 Bf109s. Single-seat fighters were the significant combatants. By and large, everything else in the air was only a potential ‘kill’. Fighting literally overseas, the Bf109s were too few, with their margins of numerical superiority inadequate. To illustrate: by my calculation between 1 June and 1 November 1940, Britain built 1,367 Hurricanes and 724 Spitfires (average per diem works out at 8.9 and 4.7 respectively). Compare those numbers with the total (operational) loss rate, which for the longer period 10 May to 4 November averaged 4.4 (Hurricanes) and 2.7 (Spitfires) per diem, and it is not hard to appreciate why the Luftwaffe failed to clear the air of annoying British aircraft. Among the many things that Oberst Schmid did not know was the non-trivial fact that in the summer and autumn of 1940 Britain was out-producing Germany in fighter aircraft (nor did he know about the superb RAF organisation for recovery and repair). Numbers abound in military aviation history and sometimes they are strategically meaningful. On the launch day for the great German air assault on Fighter Command, which is to say 13 August (to ignore the attacks on the radar system on 12 August), the Luftwaffe (Luftflotten 2 and 3) could commit only 871 Bf109s, against a Fighter Command total in the 640s. There were too few first-line operationally ready German single-seat fighters. As for the enemy, not only was Britain out-producing the Germans in fighters, but the relevant operationally available pilot numbers also tell the tale of strategic defeat for the Luftwaffe. On 6 July Fighter Command could call on 1,259 pilots, on 1 September 1,142 pilots and on 2 November, 1,797 pilots. This is the arithmetic of German strategic defeat. The dependable Bungay provides suitable closing metrics on the most relevant aircraft holdings. Apparently, on 17 August Schmid told Luftwaffe commanders that RAF Fighter Command had only 300 serviceable fighters in its active force. The real numbers for Fighter Command were “855 with operational squadrons, 209 at storage units, and another 84 at training units, a total of 1,438 twice as many as in the beginning of July.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor campaign adaptiveness:&lt;/strong&gt; German aircrew and aircraft were excellent for their place and day, but that place and day was not over Britain in 1940. Error is inevitable and unavoidable in the practice of strategy, so the unarguable fact of German mistakes cannot itself be an issue of interest here. Rather, the question is ‘how did the Luftwaffe adapt to correct for the errors which experience was revealing?’ Could it be flexible and immediately find ways to fight more effectively against Britain? The short answer, and even a long answer, is simply ‘no’. Germany lacked intelligence on most vital aspects of British air defence, and it could not possibly correct for aircraft production rate mistakes in real-time in August and September 1940. One can identify many crucial errors that could have been avoided or mitigated, had only nazi Germany in the mid to late 1930s known what historians today know. Hindsight is wonderful. The German political leadership was thoroughly disengaged from the Battle of Britain at all levels of performance: tactical, operational, and certainly strategic. Luftwaffe officers, high and low, were not formally educated at all in strategy. But, notwithstanding the many zones of German error, had the intelligence picture been far more accurate, even the physical inadequacies of the bomber force (range and/or payload) might not have been so constraining of achievement. For example, if the Luftwaffe had known what sector stations were and what they did, and if the medium bombers had attacked persistently even with their poor bomb sights, real damage with value might well have been done. Fortunately, the Luftwaffe in 1940 was not an organisation capable of improvised adaptations to the challenge from strategic hell that was the Fuhrer’s call about Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-did-britain-win-the-battle&quot;&gt;Why did Britain win the Battle?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons for Germany’s defeat are legion; indeed one is spoiled for choice. With respect to the RAF’s victory, it may be recalled that I staked a claim earlier for two essential , mutually complementary, explanations: the British air defence system which had a provenance of 25 years by 1940, and the performance of that system’s leader from 1936 until November 1940, Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh ‘Stuffy’ Dowding. In 1940, the air defence system was Dowding’s. British air defence was a team effort, as it had to be, but Dowding’s contributions were by far the most significant to the team’s achievements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise: in the early 1930s he had been the most important figure in decisions on research and development bearing upon air defence; his support was vital to the breakthrough on radar on 26 February 1935; his voice was reflected in the aircraft and armament steps taken crucially in early and mid decade; and after air defence was re-branded as Fighter Command in July 1936, with himself as the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, his was the dominant role over the tactics, operations, and strategy of British homeland air defence. The integrated air defence system won a team battle over Germany in 1940, but the team had an outstanding leader. Dowding designed what Fighter Command became: he established its procedures; he decided how it would function as a seamless network; and last but not least he selected the operational concept for engagement that made most strategic sense. The victory in 1940 was a victory for the system, but it was the ‘Dowding System’. The system was strong and had valuable redundancies, but had it been commanded by another brain and personality it might well have performed far less effectively. I conclude with an appraisal of Fighter Command’s success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dowding’s strategic sense:&lt;/strong&gt; Dowding functioned persistently and consistently in strategic mode; he understood that as the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Command his responsibility was for the strategy of air defence, inclusively considered. He committed to ensuring that each of the classic constituents of strategy – ends, ways, and means, and their underpinning assumptions – had integrity both in and of themselves and, no less important, as vital enablers for the others. This claim is so familiar as to risk appearing banal, but its frequent neglect in practice highlights its fundamental importance. Dowding modernised the system of air defence and its supporting infrastructure so as to ensure that the ways and means were sufficiently adaptable to cope with unpredicted, even unanticipated, circumstances. Moreover, Dowding had to ensure that the fighting power of his command – with its physical, moral, and conceptual components – could succeed in combat against the enemy on the day, whenever that day should dawn and for as long as it might last. Dowding possessed and consistently exercised strategic sense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defence planning with ‘minimum regrets’:&lt;/strong&gt; Dowding’s major equipment and research decisions over a ten-year period, including his long term on the Air Council from 1930-36, proved ‘right enough’. He passed the minimum regrets test. The strategist does not need to record flawless strategic performance, only one free of irrecoverable mistakes. Wherever one looks at the ends, ways, and means of British home air defence in the 1930s and into the 1940s, there is no serious room for doubt that Dowding was either right, or sufficiently correct, on the biggest decisions and in the ways in which they were to be implemented. His strategic sense enabled him to adapt to unanticipated circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptability:&lt;/strong&gt; British air defence and its victory in 1940 were the result of a quarter century of preparation that was nearly always paced well enough to be combat competitive with the extant or anticipated threat of the period and its near future. Even in the short lifetime of air power, Fighter Command in 1940 enjoyed a lengthy provenance. Dowding the strategist did not have to improvise on many significant aspects of his Command’s capability. Exceptions clearly included combat tactics, which in practice were adapted (away from the lethal ‘vic’ formation) at the squadron level, and with respect to night fighting which Dowding insisted correctly could be improved only when airborne radar was ready, and suitable two-seat aircraft to carry and employ it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dowding succeeded in preparing an architecture of air defence that could cope with a German air menace that evoled rapidly and altered markedly in quality and quantity of tactical and operational menace as a result of unpredicted, certainly unpredictable, geostrategic changes. Fighter Command was not created, developed, and then fine-tuned to deal with a Luftwaffe based in Northern France (meaning a radar assisted warning time cross Channel of 6 minutes!). RAF leaders had envisaged the German air threat in the 1930s primarily as a menace based in Germany, just possibly the Low Countries, and taking the form of medium bombers without single-seat fighter protection.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Some might argue that Fighter Command was always likely to win, almost regardless of German choices. With Germany and its Luftwaffe as they were in 1940, one can make a persuasive case to the effect that the Luftwaffe’s campaign direction was not critically important. Given what the Luftwaffe did not know about Fighter Command, and what Clausewitz called the “grammar” of war (applied to 1940), one might argue that it did not much matter whether the Germans bombed airfields, cities, or both. Fighter Command was resilient against the kind of performance that the Luftwaffe was capable of imposing. In principle, Britain’s aircraft manufacturing industry was highly vulnerable to attack, as also were the coastal facilities of the Chain Home radar system(s). But, principle and practice were far apart. And one should not be seduced either by common sense or by imagination into believing that the Luftwaffe might well have made a different operational choice here and there, and as a consequence won the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There were systemic reasons why the Luftwaffe of 1940 performed as it did in the way it did. Dowding was certainly fortunate in his enemy’s incompetence, but that is not to argue that he succeeded because he was lucky. It was true that he was the fortunate command legatee of two decades of high British competence in air defence. It is also true to say, however, that Dowding personally contributed very significantly to the future strength of that air defence by virtue of his enthusiastic endorsement of vital technical developments both before and after he assumed command in July 1936. Of course, the successful defensive performance in 1940 was won by a team of outstanding contributors to Fighter Command’s combat potency, but the overarching and most persuasive explanation for the victory was that the Command benefited from superior strategic leadership for long enough to give it decisive advantages over the Luftwaffe. It was not luck that in 1940 Fighter Command had excellent equipment when it mattered most, that it was settled in pursuit of the most prudent and effective master operational concept, that its battlespace general (Keith Park) truly was Dowding’s alter ego in military grasp and strategic sense, and that scientific and technical challenges consistently were addressed competently by the Command.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command:&lt;/strong&gt; Dowding persisted with what history demonstrated to be the correct command philosophy and broad guiding concept of operations (near continuous engagement with the minimum force necessary to disrupt him – to limit British losses). He reserved for himself the role of strategist, delegating operational command to his exceptionally capable subordinate, Keith Park, at 11 Group, who played the role of Sherman to Dowding’s Grant. Park, in his turn, delegated tactical command to his sector station controllers – up to the point of air-to-air contact, when squadron commanders aloft took charge. Because he adhered firmly to a strategic standard for his performance, Dowding selected a concept of operations for Park to follow that expressed the strategic purpose of the command at that time. Dowding never forgot that his goal was to deny the Germans a convincing narrative that would support the invasion option. He could not decide for Berlin how much damage his Command needed to inflict on the Luftwaffe. What he could do, however, was ensure that no rational, if optimistic, Luftwaffe briefing to the Fuhrer could claim credibly to have defeated the RAF. Overy is plausible when he writes: “It is evident that not a lot was needed to deter Hitler from the idea of invading Britain. Fighter Command tipped the balance.” Dowding could not have known this at the time. He needed both to be able to continue to hurt the Luftwaffe seriously, all the while, in the process, never ceasing to demonstrate that Fighter Command remained alive and well enough. Dowding made his single greatest strategic contribution to British survival in 1940 in mid May over the burning issue of the immediate dispatch to France of many more Hurricanes from the home defence force. On 16 May Dowding wrote a 10 point memorandum to the War Cabinet, via the Undersecretary of State for Air, Harold Balfour, in which he explained the current strategic facts of life with characteristic exemplary bluntness. He wrote that if Fighter Command sent more planes to France (in a losing cause) they would not only fail to save the French, but their loss would all but guarantee the subsequent consequential defeat of Britain also. Dowding prevailed, Fighter Command (almost) ceased leaking Hurricanes to France, and the Command was not expended in a lost cause in May-June. Dowding was not afraid to tell Prime Minister Churchill what he did not want to hear – that we should not try to help the French anymore, even though they were still fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can summarise Dowding’s concept of operations as minimum effective response, to deny the Luftwaffe even the possibility of a decisive victory in the air (or against airfields). Many of Dowding’s critics could not understand why Fighter Command committed only a fraction of its total force, most especially of its best fighter aircraft, the Spitfire, to combat at any one time. His was not the most exciting of operational concepts, but it was far and away the most prudent, and it was a strategic victory by any plausible definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.militarystrategymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/70.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has been written about Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, perhaps the most familiar of Hitler’s lieutenants. Bashing the Rommel myth has become something of a pastime for historians — and why not? The legend of the “Desert Fox” was deliberately and aggressively fashioned by Rommel himself — with the enthusiastic collaboration of the vast Nazi propaganda machine. Clearing away the underbrush of legend is one of the services that historians provide. And there is much to clear away in this case. To be sure, Rommel defeated a number of able French and British commanders before his string of successes was broken by General Bernard Law Montgomery in the autumn of 1942. The phrase “doing a Rommel” even became a catchword for outsmarting an opponent, whether on the battlefield or the game board. However, Rommel’s string of victories also worked against him — concealing not only the extent to which the German way of war had become bifurcated, but also two elements that made the Wehrmacht’s tactical successes possible in the first place, namely, logistical support and air cover. If, as Clausewitz said, war has its own grammar, but not its own logic, then Rommel’s military grammar detached itself from the war’s political logic and attempted to follow its own path. That path put a premium on waging a fluid war of movement, and continually pushed men and material to their limits, regardless of logistical realities and the operational range of air power. It was also a method that ultimately ran counter to Hitler’s larger strategic aims because it precipitously wore down the very fighting machine that was merely supposed to buy time and achieve some stability along the flank of the main theater of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North African theater was never more than a sideshow for Hitler, an effort to bolster a failing ally who was fast becoming a liability. After June 1941, the main effort for the Reich was the war against the Soviet Union, which by the autumn of that year had escalated from a supposedly swift campaign of occupation into a brutal struggle for existence between National Socialism and Stalinism. Rommel’s theater would never enjoy anything more than a tertiary status — behind the campaign in the east and the war in the Atlantic — something he apparently understood, but refused to accept. Right or wrong, Hitler’s political logic was clear. Yet, Rommel continually appealed to the High Command for more troops, as if taking Cairo and the Suez Canal could end the war in Germany’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing in Rommel’s personal background suggests that he had the mettle to rise to high-level military command. As an officer candidate, he was rated above average, but definitely not exceptional. As a junior officer in the First World War, he proved to be intelligent, brave, and resourceful — but so were tens of thousands of other young men. Good fortune and his relentless self-promotion, perhaps driven by personal insecurities regarding his class and social standing (he was not Prussian), enabled him to make the most of his exploits: he was awarded the Iron Cross, first and second classes, as well as the Pour le’Merite. His book, Infantry Attacks (1937), was little more than a collection of war stories posing as tactical lessons; yet, it added much to his personal image as a tactician. Rommel later wrote, “position warfare is always a struggle for the destruction of men — in contrast to mobile warfare, where everything turns on the destruction of enemy material.” This is an ironic observation given that El Alamein was a classic example of position warfare. He clearly preferred a war of movement, captured rather adroitly with the phrase “Schlacht ohne Morgen” or battle without end, and — almost to a fault — consistently placed himself at the point of attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, regardless of his rank, Rommel habitually exerted his personal influence at the decisive point. However, that habit reveals that he was a micromanager, a leader who was unwilling to trust his subordinates with important tasks. He often assumed command of his subordinates’ units, a practice that ran contrary to the supposed German tradition of issuing broad orders of intent (Auftragstaktik) and giving one’s subordinates the latitude to execute them according to the situation. One notable example is the 7th Panzer Division’s attempt to cross the Meuse River on May 13, 1940, during the campaign in France. The attempt failed despite Rommel’s personal intervention because, in his view, his subordinate officers “were appalled by their heavy losses and unwilling to press forward.” Ironically, while he typically expected nothing short of instant obedience from his own officers and men, he frequently disregarded his superiors’ orders, or creatively reinterpreted them so that they were less restrictive. Rommel’s practice contradicts the received view regarding the importance of Auftragstaktik in German military practice, and this contradiction is an issue historians have yet to examine more closely. Moreover, he habitually disregarded the physical and psychological limits of the personnel under his command, and deftly shifted blame for failure onto them to preserve his image. This habit inhibited his ability to conduct an objective analysis of his own shortcomings and style of command so as to increase his chances of success in the long-term. The cultivation of his image not only required constant attention; it also meant suppressing inconvenient truths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rommel’s skills seem to have peaked at the battle of Gazala in June 1942, about one week before the first battle of El Alamein. For purposes of this essay, the events around El Alamein that took place between July 1, 1942, and November 4, 1942, are considered as three distinct battles. Although the battle of Gazala would end successfully, Rommel actually followed what for him had become a predictable scheme of maneuver: a wide envelopment of the British left flank, followed by an attack in the rear across the British lines of communication. The scheme pushed the Afrikakorps’ logistics to its extreme limit, and nearly caused a disaster. It is likely that Rommel’s style of leading from the front saved him from defeat in this case, as it enabled him to issue orders, and counter-orders, faster than his opponents. He operated inside his enemy’s decision cycle, to use one of today’s popular military expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, most of the successes he enjoyed at Gazala and the subsequent assault on Tobruk were due to his foe’s ineptitude. During the encounters that took place in and around the “Cauldron” or “Sausage Pot” (May 30 to June 1, 1942), for example, Rommel had rashly maneuvered himself into a difficult situation: to his west he had a series of extensive minefields with half dozen fortified “boxes,” or strong points, occupied by dug-in infantry brigades, reinforced with tanks and artillery; while to his east he faced several British armored formations, some of which were equipped with the new American Grant tanks armed with powerful 75mm guns. A vigorous attack by the British commander, Lieutenant-General Neil Ritchie, might have crushed the Afrikakorps, which by this time had lost a third of its tanks and was desperately low on fuel. Instead, Ritchie threw his armor into the battle in piecemeal fashion, which enabled the Axis formations to fight and defeat them individually. To be saved from a desperate situation by the poor choices of one’s opponent is not the same as winning by demonstrating consummate skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tobruk fell in the summer of 1942, and during the pursuit and exploitation that followed Rommel should have pushed his air cover forward. Otherwise, he would have little real hope of taking Cairo, or of holding anything he had gained, since he would be exposed to Allied air attack. Some analysts have argued that he ought to have paused to take Malta and strengthen his logistical situation, after all Axis forces required roughly 100,000 tons of supplies per month during the late summer and early autumn of 1942; but were only receiving half that much on average. However, establishing forward air cover was actually more critical since his forces were already exposed, and because Allied ground forces essentially operated free of the threat of Axis air attack. Rommel could not win the race to build up materiel, whether or not Malta was taken, and thus — by his own formula — he was becoming less capable of winning a war of movement. His operational intelligence, ground movement, and logistics’ flow suffered markedly due to the limited range of Axis air cover. Without forward air bases, he could not prevent his ground forces or their supply lines across Libya from being bombed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the point: as the Allies advanced into Italy in 1943, their air cover also leapfrogged to new bases and airfields in order to ensure adequate coverage for the next series of ground operations. The Allies’ task was, obviously, made easier by the fact that more of the Luftwaffe’s planes were being diverted to defend the German homeland from major bombing offensives. Still, modern warfare had evolved into a system by which the forward movement of ground forces was often driven by the need to capture another airfield, so that air cover could be extended to cover the next ground offensive, and so on. Fire and movement, always mutually reinforcing at the tactical level of war, had become similarly interdependent at the operational level of war as well. Rommel came to appreciate this fact far too late in the North African campaign (though he appears to have learned it by the battle for Normandy in 1944), and never took effective action to ensure his formations had adequate protection from Allied air forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the pursuit after Gazala, Rommel attempted to avoid drifting into a war of position by getting ahead of the retreating British; however, his lack of fuel, the fatigue of his men, and the state of their equipment prevented him from doing so. His troops were all but spent, having fought hard across 500 miles of desert; his tanks were low in fuel and ammunition, and badly in need of refitting. The Desert Fox, too, was mentally and physically drained, as were many of his subordinate commanders, notwithstanding the emotional boost that came from his promotion to Generalfeldmarschall in late June, and the Afrikakorps’ stunning success at Gazala. Fatigue and perhaps a bit of overconfidence led to hasty command decisions and poor staff coordination as the first battle of El Alamein began on July 1, 1942. Once again, Rommel overestimated the capabilities of his troops, while at the same time underestimating those of his foes. After three weeks of fighting, Rommel’s forces had lost 70 percent of their manpower, 85 percent of their armor, 65 percent of their anti-tank weapons, and 50 percent of their heavy anti-aircraft guns. Rommel found himself forced to transition from a war of movement, where his tight decision-cycle and his penchant for pushing his forces to their limits gave him an advantage, to a war of position, where superiority in numbers would tell. The uniqueness of the terrain around El Alamein and the rapidity with which British strength could grow meant that he would gradually lose his room to maneuver, and, thus, his ability to create chaos for his adversary. In addition, the Allies enjoyed an intelligence advantage through ULTRA that enabled them to read the coded messages sent between Rommel’s headquarters and Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rommel renewed his offensive on August 30, 1942, which became known as the second battle of El Alamein, or Alam al-Halfa; but it was doomed from the start. Even though he allegedly scaled back his original objectives, he apparently retained high hopes of success. As he confided in his wife, Lucie: “I have worried so much about this day, but I am taking the risk because I will not have another chance, in terms of the moonlight and ratio of forces. So much is at stake. If I succeed, this may have a decisive effect on the course of the war.” Yet, Rommel’s plan of attack was very reminiscent of Gazala, so much so that the British did not need ULTRA to prepare for it. Rommel sent the Italian infantry in a pinning attack to the front, and directed the Afrikakorps to punch through a perceived 13-mile gap between the southern positions of the British forces and the Quattara Depression. They were then to attack across the coastal roads leading west into El Alamein, thereby severing British lines of communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the predictability of the plan and the Allies’ advantages in strategic and operational intelligence, terrain, and materiel began to tell almost immediately. The attack bogged down, and Rommel called it off on September 4, 1942. General Montgomery received the credit for stopping the Axis advance; but his plan was essentially the same as that of his predecessor, Field Marshal Sir Claude Auchinleck. Montgomery’s success was ensured, so long as he avoided committing a blunder, such as allowing himself to be baited into counterattacking prematurely. With materiel preponderance, he had the luxury of time and could afford not to chase imaginative solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Montgomery launched the final battle of El Alamein on October 23, 1942, Rommel was in Germany on much needed sick leave. He returned to North Africa on the evening of the 25th; but the battle was all but lost by then. Montgomery enjoyed a 2:1 superiority in manpower, a 3:1 superiority in aircraft, and more than a 4:1 superiority in medium tanks. The third clash at El Alamein was little more than a World War I battle of attrition; but it was one the Allies could afford to wage. To be sure, there were several crises that required Montgomery to exert his will over subordinate commanders who were not accustomed to pushing forward against enemy fire. However, the outcome of the battle was a matter of military science, the mathematics of attrition. Military art had little say, and could not change the result. The interdiction efforts of Allied air power had severely limited Rommel’s flow of supplies. Although he attempted to launch a few counterattacks, the deficiencies in fuel and ammunition were crippling. His army was overextended and egregiously exposed, as it had been since the first battle of El Alamein, though he and many of those around him chose to ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On balance, Rommel’s style of command, while often praised by military historians, was actually ill-suited to the conditions in which he found himself. It resembled the leadership style in vogue in the nineteenth century, where the timely appearance of the commander at the decisive point on the battlefield might tip the scales toward victory. However, in the twentieth century, command at higher levels required mastering and incorporating new dimensions, such as operational-level air support and theater-level intelligence, into one’s scheme of maneuver. Rommel did not fully incorporate those dimensions into his planning. To draw an analogy, Rommel was like a chess player who used the same combination of moves again and again, while neglecting to appreciate that the rules of the game had changed. He repeatedly went on the offensive with his armor and, though enjoying many tactical successes, fatally overextended his logistics and exceeded the range of his air cover. Hitler, rightly or wrongly, desired that the campaign in North Africa should have only a tertiary priority. Rommel was unwilling, or possibly unable, to function under such an inconsequential status. His conduct of the campaign in North Africa, and in particular the battles of El Alamein, illustrate the principal flaw in a way of war predicated on the idea that wars are won from the ground up — through tactical victories. In such an approach, strategy matters little and the influence of policy even less, for the power of tactical success seemingly trumps all. However, as Rommel’s example shows, his exquisite grammar had become detached from the larger logic of the war. His brilliant tactical successes failed to achieve anything of strategic value, and ultimately Hitler’s policy trumped them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last shots of Israel’s War for Independence were fired in early 1949. From January to July 1949 Israel negotiated separately with each of its Arab neighbours – Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria – to work out a political arrangement and an official cessation of hostilities. The first agreement was signed with Egypt in February 1949 and the last was signed with Syria in July of the same year. However, Israel’s hope that these agreements would be peace treaties or would, at least, become the first step leading to such treaties was disappointed. Concluding that a rematch was inevitable, Israel’s political and military leadership began to develop a grand-strategic doctrine and a strategic doctrine. These doctrines were not formulated in a single official document and did not develop in a single smooth trajectory. They developed in many debates, flashes of inspiration, and adapting in response to enemy activities. Different people had different ideas. Sometimes, it was who was sitting in which chair that was more important than the debates being conducted around the table. Changes in the manning of senior positions and lessons learned from specific events brought about changes in the concepts. However, it is not the purpose of the present article to describe all the twists and turns along the path, only to discuss a single event to which these doctrines were applied, achieved some success, but then failed – Israel’s war with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in Lebanon, which culminated in the all-out Israeli offensive into Lebanon in 1982. The seeds of the decision to undertake this offensive were sown over thirty years earlier in the formulation of the aforementioned doctrines, and so the relevant aspects will be described in brief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s first order of business after winning its War of Independence was not to prepare for future conflict, but rather to prepare for peace – building a society, an economy and a legal system, while simultaneously absorbing an enormous influx of immigrants from around the world, speaking different languages and living according to different cultural norms. However, very quickly it became clear that the War of Independence might be over officially but not in fact. Palestinian Arabs who had fled into neighbouring countries began to conduct forays into Israel. Some were innocent – people trying to collect possessions left behind, and some were criminal – theft of Israeli property in order to facilitate life in the refugee camps. Gradually they began to be more and more political, aiming simply to kill Israelis and cause damage to property. The Arab armies also conducted cross-border intelligence raids or tried to nibble bits of land away from Israel. Israel’s political and military leaders concluded that they were in fact facing two distinct threats, each of which required a different strategic approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fundamental Threat – an all-out offensive by an Arab army or combination of Arab armies. This required Israel to build an army capable of defeating any combination of Arab armies, despite being numerically inferior, without bankrupting Israel’s still fragile economy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Routine Threat – the conduct of intermittent cross-border raids by small groups of guerrilla-style fighters or regular troops. These raids were not considered an existential threat in the sense of being able to physically destroy Israel, but Prime-Minister Ben-Gurion feared that they could destroy the self-confidence of the new immigrants, settling along the borders, and cause them to flee the country – thus achieving gradually what the Arab armies had failed to achieve in one fell swoop. Again, the solution had to be one that would not require massive expenditure of Israel’s limited manpower and treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctrine of Routine Security, developed through the 1950s, was the core of the decision to invade Lebanon in 1982. Israel’s initial strategy was defensive – army units were deployed in ambushes and patrols along the borders. This failed – there were not enough troops to cover more than a fraction of the border at any one moment. The next strategy was aptly named ‘An Eye For An Eye’. Following each Arab raid into Israel, the Israeli army conducted a raid aimed at causing similar casualties and damage across the border. This aroused an ethical argument in Israel, international condemnations, and failed to elicit the desired response – a reduction in Arab raids. So Israel’s leadership upped the ante – it decided to change the targets and retaliate more massively. The new target was Arab property, not people, but en masse. If an Israeli village was attacked then an Arab village was captured, evacuated and the houses destroyed. However, Arab raids continued unabated and the ethical problem was not solved, as became clear after the botched Kibya operation in autumn 1953, in which the Israeli force ordered the population to evacuate but, contrary to orders, did not search the houses to ensure that all had actually done so. 63 civilians died. The result was uproar in Israel and around the world. It was clear that this strategy was neither effective nor sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this point Israel had tried to achieve Routine Security by confronting the perpetrators (commonly known as Fedayeen) directly or by deterring them via retaliation raids. Both ways had failed. The Israelis could not find the Fedayeen in the field nor in their safe-havens, and the damage caused to the neighbouring Arab population did not really interest the Fedayeen because they were not from the same clans or families. The Israelis decided on a new strategy – they could not find the Fedayeen, but the governments of the host-states could. The new strategy was to compel the Arab governments to stop the attacks from their territory by retaliating for Fedayeen raids with counter-raids on the host-states’ military. Hopefully, repeated expensive defeats of their troops would shame the Arab governments and they would prefer to prevent further provocation of Israel. It took time, but the new strategy worked – Egypt was the first to gradually suspend Fedayeen activity through its border with Israel from the mid-1950s; then Syria, which, from the mid-1960s, continued to support Fedayeen activity but only if the actual raid was conducted through Jordan or Lebanon; and finally Jordan forcibly evicted the PLO from its territory in September 1970. Only the Lebanese border remained open for the Fedayeen raids. Encouraged by Syria, the Fedayeen had begun to gradually intensify their operations from Lebanon from the late 1960s. To the cross-border raids they added two new operational modes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stand-off fire – at first with short-range weapons and gradually with longer-ranged weapons culminating in the late 1970s with long-range field-guns and rockets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overseas raids – attacking Israelis and non-Israeli Jews in locations around the world. The most notorious attacks were the hijacking of civilian aircraft and the massacre in the 1972 Olympic games in Munich.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the late 1970s, fighting along Israel’s border with Lebanon had become an almost daily affair. In theory Israel had a proven strategic solution. However, this solution was not suitable to the Lebanese theatre. It depended on the host-state having a strong central government capable of imposing its political will, and if need be, military will on the Fedayeen. Lebanon did not have such a government. By the early 1970s Lebanon’s society and political system had unraveled. Established by the French to provide the local Christian community a state of their own, in which they were a majority, its political system had been designed on a sectarian-religious basis. However, by 1970 the Christians were no longer the majority. They were still the largest religious group, but smaller than any other two groups combined. The arrival of the PLO’s military forces in Lebanon had completely destroyed the last vestiges of Christian superiority over the other religious groups. Lebanon disintegrated into civil war. Each religious group battled the others for territory, political and economic benefits and clans within each group often battled each other for domination of the group. The Lebanese army disintegrated along religious lines. The strongest military force in Lebanon was the PLO – also divided into factions often battling each other. A new-old actor entered the Lebanese stage – Syria. Syria had always claimed that Lebanon was actually an integral part of Syria, illegitimately torn away by the departing French Empire. Covertly Syria had assisted the gradual dissolving of the Lebanese government’s control. Another Syrian interest in Lebanon was money. Lebanese banks, the international port of Beirut, Lebanese agriculture and industry – all were important to the well-being of Syria’s fragile agriculture-based economy. The civil war threatened Syria’s economy and Syria reacted by invading Lebanon. At first, the Syrian invasion was aimed to assist the Christians because they dominated most of the areas important to Syria. However, gradually, the Syrians began to assert their domination against the Christians and fighting broke out between them – the ratio of power ensuring a Syrian victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;back-to-israel-in-the-early-1950s&quot;&gt;Back to Israel in the early 1950s&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Routine Security was an important issue, but Fundamental Security was considered more critical. It was clear that Israel could never match the size of her neighbours’ military forces. Foreign powers refused to sell anything other than second-hand, mostly well-worn, World War Two vintage equipment to Israel, so it was also fairly clear that Israel could not achieve technological superiority. During 1950 – 1953 a series of tactical disasters in Routine Security operations seemed to show that even the Israel Defence Forces’ superiority in tactics and fighting spirit no longer existed. The Israel Defence Forces’ senior command addressed the quality issue in various ways not relevant to this article. What is relevant is that during this period Prime Minister Ben-Gurion advanced the idea of an ‘Alliance of Minorities’. The Jews were not the only ethnic minority struggling to float in the stormy sea of the Moslem Arab world: the Copts in Egypt, the Kurds and the Druze in Syria, the Kurds in Iraq and the Maronite Christians and the Druze in Lebanon. An ‘Alliance of Minorities’ would strengthen each separate minority in its own private struggle by splitting the attention and resources of the Moslem Arab states between a number of simultaneous conflicts. Israel’s main benefit would be that the Arab states would be hard put to enact the worst nightmare of Israel’s military leaders – called the ‘Everybody Scenario’, an organized alliance of all the Arab states conducting a simultaneous properly planned assault on Israel. As it turned out, the idea was stillborn. The Copts proved completely incapable of organizing effectively to further their political agenda. The Kurds were similarly split into rival factions, though from the early 1960s until 1975 the Iraqi Kurds managed to conduct an insurgency that diverted most of Iraq’s attention to them and away from Israel. The Druze and the Maronites were not interested. The Maronites were the only non-Jewish minority with a state of their own and saw no threat that required them to befriend Israel. However, as the situation in Lebanon gradually developed against them they turned to Israel for help. Though officially the idea of the ‘Alliance of Minorities’ had been shelved, the principle that helping another minority would help Israel remained – as in the case of the Iraqi Kurds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gradually worsening plight of the Maronites also triggered another Israeli ideological concept. One of the main complaints of the Jews following the Second World War was that they had been abandoned by the world to suffer the Holocaust. Even requests for small, relatively cheap actions that could have partially alleviated the plight of the Jews suffering Nazi persecution (such as the bombing of Auschwitz Extermination Camp which would have slowed the killing-machine) had been refused. When faced with cries for help from a religious minority, ostensibly about to suffer decimation and persecution, Israel’s political leaders were incapable of denying assistance. Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad and the Israel Defence Forces were ordered to provide equipment and training and occasional military action to support the Maronites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 1980 some of Israel’s political and military leaders were already beginning to formulate a new strategy for solving the Lebanese conundrum. The new strategy was based on a series of assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason the Christians had lost power in Lebanon was the arrival of the PLO after it had been forcibly ejected from Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Destruction of the PLO’s military power and evicting its political infrastructure from Lebanon would enable the Christians to reassume their position as the dominant group in Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evicting Syrian military forces out of Lebanon would also be required.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Christians would gratefully acknowledge Israel’s assistance in achieving their political goals by signing a full peace treaty with Israel – the second Arab state to do so (after Egypt) – and prevent the return of the Palestinian political and military leaders to Lebanon, thus terminating the Routine Threat on this front too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s Minister of Defence at the time, Ariel Sharon, hoped that the successful result would also cascade into other theatres of conflict: removal of the PLO’s political and military infrastructure from its last contact with Israel’s border would fatally weaken its standing among the Palestinian Arabs and the Arab states in general. This would also enable Jordan to sign a peace treaty with Israel, leaving only one Arab state on Israel’s border, a defeated Syria, alone in its refusal to accept Israel but far too weak to do anything about it. However, implementing the new strategy required a particular set of political conditions that would legitimize such an offensive in the eyes of the Israeli public and the world at large – especially Israel’s only ally, the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 1981, and again in March and in April, the PLO initiated a series of artillery attacks on northern Israel, each lasting a few days. In late April, following the indiscriminate bombardment by the Syrian army of the Lebanese Christian town of Zakhle, Israel threatened to intervene against Syria. To put the point across forcefully, the Israeli air force was ordered to shoot down two Syrian helicopters flying near Zakhle. The Syrians responded by violating a tacitly agreed ‘red-line’ – they deployed a number of Surface-to-Air Missile batteries in Lebanon. Only American diplomatic pressure stopped Israel from immediately attacking these missile batteries. Meanwhile, on June 7th, while the diplomatic exchange was still in progress and tensions high, Israel surprised the world by destroying Iraq’s new nuclear reactor. On July 9th the Palestinians again fired a salvo of rockets into northern Israel. Over the next two weeks Israel and the PLO exchanged fire, and Israel prepared to conduct a large-scale strategic punitive raid into southern Lebanon. An attempt by the Syrian air force to intercept Israeli aircraft over Lebanon resulted in a Syrian aircraft being shot down. An Israeli air-strike on a Palestinian headquarters in Beirut accidentally killed and injured many civilians living around the target. This prompted American intervention, which brought about a ceasefire. However, the exact agreement was not clear. The Palestinians claimed the ceasefire was only for the Lebanese-Israel border and they were free to attack everywhere else. This left Israel at a disadvantage since it could be attacked almost anywhere but could not respond because all of the Palestinian’s political and military infrastructure was in Lebanon. From August 1981 to May 1982 the Palestinians conducted 248 attacks in Israel and overseas. Israel responded with threats and troop deployments, but each time backed-off. In March 1982 and again in April Israel retaliated with air-strikes in Lebanon, and the Palestinians fired dozens of rockets from Lebanon into Israel, though aimed mostly at unpopulated areas so as not to over-antagonize Israel. On June 3, 1982 Palestinians shot the Israeli ambassador in Britain. Israel retaliated again with air-strikes in Beirut and the Palestinians again fired rockets into Israel. On June 5th, after two days of mutual firing, the Israeli government decided that it would not tolerate a repeat of the previous summer’s artillery duel. The Israeli Defence Forces were ordered to invade Lebanon and capture all the terrain from the border to just beyond the extreme range of the Palestinian artillery – that is to say, to advance to a line that was nowhere closer than approximately 40 kilometers to the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, the supporters of the new strategy described above had received the ‘go ahead’ to implement it. In fact, they had not. Implementation of the strategy required the Israeli army to reach and capture Beirut – that was where all of the political infrastructure and leadership and most of the military infrastructure were located. It also required the Syrians to be either maneuvered into withdrawing from Lebanon or defeated and forced out. Both were well beyond the objective defined by the government. Minister of Defence Sharon faced two tactical problems to implement the new strategy: the political problem of convincing the government to increase the scope of the operation and convincing the public to support this; and the military problem of conducting the operation in disjointed phases as the government gradually allowed each extension of the operation, thus allowing the enemy time to recover, reorganize, reinforce and gradually comprehend the operational plan, making each succeeding phase harder to carry out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Israeli offensive began at noon on June 6th. Sharon gradually overcame both tactical problems but the price was that an operation planned to last a few days stretched to a number of weeks, then a few months. This stretching produced new problems. Politically, it allowed internal and foreign resistance to the operation to build up. As the war dragged on, parts of the Israeli public began to question the validity of the decision to initiate it and foreign powers began to intervene diplomatically. Militarily, the cost in casualties rose and further fueled the growing resistance in Israel to maintain the effort – the first mass Israeli demonstration against the war occurred on July 4th. However, despite all problems, the military objective was partially achieved towards the end of August – the PLO agreed to leave Lebanon and was shipped to Tunisia, and overt Syrian presence was removed from Beirut-proper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time had come to implement the second political phase – handing power back to a Christian-dominated government. The Israelis withdrew from parts of Beirut. The Lebanese conducted elections on August 23rd and Israel’s ally Bashir Jumayel, head of the largest Christian party, was elected to be the President of Lebanon. Israel’s strategy, as interpreted and implemented by Defence Minister Sharon, had prevailed. Then, suddenly, everything began to unravel. It quickly became clear that the Palestinians had covertly left a portion of their fighters in Beirut to conduct a guerrilla campaign against the Israelis. Having promised not to enter certain areas in Beirut, the Israelis demanded that the Lebanese government prove its ability to handle the common enemy on its own. However, on September 14th Syrian intelligence operatives assassinated President Jumayel. He was replaced by his brother Amin – who was understandably less willing to actually implement the agreements his dead brother had with Israel. Meanwhile, the Jumayel’s private military militia, tasked with clearing Palestinian guerrillas from two Palestinian neighbourhoods in Beirut – Sabra and Shatilla, avenged the death of their leader by massacring a few hundred Palestinians. Though conducted by Lebanese Christians the massacre was blamed on Israel – not just around the world, but also inside Israel. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis – nearly 10% of the Jewish population, gathered in the largest ever demonstration in Israel to protest the fact that the Israeli army had not prevented the massacre. Lastly, Israel’s outright support for the Maronite Christians reassuming full power in Lebanon did not sit well with the other ethnic groups – the Sunnis, the Shiites and the Druze. Initially many members of these groups had supported the Israeli invasion, greeting Israeli soldiers with flowers and rice. Now they began to attack the Israelis. Leading these attacks were two Shiite parties – Amal (the larger of the two) and Hizbullah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary political and military objective of the war had been achieved – the PLO had been evicted from its last stronghold directly in contact with Israeli territory. It could no longer conduct cross-border attacks on Israel proper. However, the secondary political object, though seeming at first to be in hand, was lost. The single bomb that killed Bashir Jumayel proved to be more powerful than all the thousands of bombs and shells fired by the Israelis. The Syrians remained in control of Lebanon. An Israeli judicial committee sacked Sharon for failing to prevent the massacre in Sabra and Shatilla. The Israelis did not give up immediately. But gradually, as casualties mounted and it became clear that their continued presence in Lebanon was not going to achieve their second political objective of obtaining a peace treaty with Lebanon, they decided to cut their losses and make do with a half-win. The withdrawal was gradual and completed in 1985. To secure their border, the Israelis organized a buffer-zone held by the South Lebanese Army – a militia manned by local volunteers from southern Lebanon, funded, equipped and trained by Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s withdrawal was accepted by all the Lebanese militias fighting against them as well as terminating the war – all except Hizbullah. For approximately 18 months the fighting subsided as Hizbullah grew from a small almost insignificant group into a major player, and then began a guerrilla-style offensive on the Israeli buffer-zone, forcing the Israelis to reinforce the South Lebanese Army with Israeli units. It seemed that Israel’s decisive defeat of the PLO had only achieved a brief reprieve and simply replaced the enemy at the gates. Against this new enemy the Israelis had no clear policy and no clear strategy other than to stick it out at the least cost possible in blood and resources. They continued to do this until 2000, when they withdrew from the buffer-zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up, from the mid-1950s Israel’s ultimate strategy against the Routine Threat was to punish the host-states until they prevented hostile actions from their territory. This strategy was not possible in Lebanon because the Lebanese government was too weak. In attempting to manufacture a strong Lebanese government Israel invaded Lebanon and evicted the PLO and then, in accordance with the concept of the ‘Alliance of Minorities’, tried to hand over power to the Lebanese Christians – thus alienating the other Lebanese religious groups. Moreover, the Israelis misjudged the Christians’ political and military strength relative to these other Lebanese groups – even with Israeli backing the Christians were no longer capable of ruling Lebanon. Three years later – in 1985 – under continuous attack, hundreds of additional casualties, and billions of shekels worth of resources more than planned, the Israelis decided to cut their losses and they withdrew. Not properly adapted to Lebanon – Israel’s strategy had failed to achieve more than a partial victory. This, it turned out, was just the beginning of a new war, with a new enemy (Hizbullah) upon the same turf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last half decade since arriving at West Point to teach history after three years of Cavalry Squadron command (one of those years in combat in west Baghdad in 2006) I have made a sustained argument in many published works about the primacy of strategy over tactics in war. My argument has basically said that if a state gets its strategy right in war then the tactics of war will fall into place. However, I argued simplistically and wrongly, if a state fails at strategy, then no amount of tactical excellence can save a war fought under a botched strategy. I began to develop this argument in response to a certain narrative that had formed since the Surge of Troops in Iraq in 2007. That narrative offered the attractive proposition that the US Army had failed at the tactics of counterinsurgency in Iraq from 2003 to 2006 but then the army was saved by an enlightened general named David Petraeus who turned his army around, got it doing the tactics of counterinsurgency right, and Iraq was put on the path to success thus giving Iraqis, in Petraeus’s own words, a “new hope.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still believe the Iraq Surge triumph narrative is misleading. Petraeus as a general performed in essentially the same way as his predecessor General George Casey, and there was no radical shift in operational method between the Surge army and what came before. Instead, violence in Iraq dropped by the end of 2007 primarily for other reasons, such as the spread of the Anbar Awakening, the effects of the previous two years of sectarian warfare, and the shia militia decision to stand down attacks. There is a growing body of analytical literature to support this explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet I also believe that I have become somewhat dogmatic in my sustained argument about the primacy of strategy over tactics. Last year while giving a lunchtime keynote address at a history conference at Columbia University in New York City where I made the argument of the primacy of strategy over tactics, Professor Anders Stephanson, a scholar of American diplomatic and political history at Columbia, pushed back in the ‘question and answer’ period by saying that my argument was “a-historical.” In the weeks following my lecture I reflected on what he said and concluded that he was right. If by rule strategy is always more important than tactics, then the logic of that rule is that tactics in war simply don’t matter. But they do. Any military historian worth his or her salt knows that sometimes in war tactics mean a lot, and wars can be lost by failing at tactics. Consider Louis XIV and the War of Spanish Succession from 1701 to 1713. Louis’s aims in the Low Countries were not stymied by poor strategy but more so by generals who were unable to fight effectively with the emerging technologies and tactics of early modern linear warfare. In fact, if Louis had been asked which one was more important during the war of Spanish Succession he almost certainly would have said tactical competence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet such a nuance of historical understanding was buried by my rule of the primacy of strategy over tactics. By establishing as a rule the primacy of strategy over tactics I have turned into what historians most often fear: the social scientist and the constructionist of models, which lead to the cherry picking of history to confirm the model. I found myself using historical examples that conformed to my rule. My favorite example to support the rule of the primacy of strategy over tactics was the German army in World War II. Probably one of the finest industrialized tactical fighting forces the world had ever seen, I argued, that all of their tactical excellence could not rescue Germany from a dysfunctional strategy and morally perverse policy under Nazism. True enough of course for Germany and World War II, but for the historian just because something is true in one part of history, does not mean it is true for it all. This is what historians call contingency and the uniqueness of historical events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being slaved to my model of the primacy of strategy over tactics also caused me to fail at one of the hallmarks of good scholarly history: factual accuracy. Here is what happened to me. About three years ago when I was arguing forcefully that better tactics did not turn the war in Vietnam around under Abrams, nor in Iraq did enlightened counterinsurgency tactics under Petraeus turn that war around either, I came across a quote that was apparently made by Sun Tzu. “Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory, but tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.” That reported Sun Tzu quote summed it all up for me in one short, clear, and brilliantly insightful phrase. Get your strategy right and the tactics will fall into place. Get your strategy wrong, however, and tactical excellence is only noise. But Sun Tzu never said it. To be sure it is an apocryphal quote where people believe Sun Tzu said it, though being apocryphal is different from established fact. I had become trapped by my model of the primacy of strategy over tactics and Sun Tzu’s reported quote seemed to sum it up so nicely with the weight of history and the power of the philosophy of Sun Tzu behind it, that I failed as a historian to check the actual primary source, The Art of War, to see if he actually said it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such is the seductive power of social scientific models: they order and rationalize things so well and explain present day problems so neatly. For me, the principle of the primacy of strategy over tactics in war became an unalterable rule, which history and my own writings of it had to conform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have seen the errors of my ways and am recovering from the addiction of a rule-bound model that overly simplifies the past. My recovery was aided, naturally, through the study of history and teaching it in the classroom. It is not that I have come to believe that tactics matter most in war, or that tactical excellence can save failed strategy. Instead, through the study and teaching of history I have come to see that tactics do matter, sometimes a lot, and battles matter too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Washington and the year 1776 in the American Revolution come to mind. It was a difficult year for the Continental Army, Washington, and the Revolution itself. The previous year saw a string of apparent American victories by militia forces at Lexington-Concord and at Bunker Hill. But in 1776 the British became focused and allocated resources toward crushing the rebellion. Thus, the Continental army under Washington felt the full weight of British imperial power at the Battle of Long Island, White Plains, and the embarrassing retreat of Washington and his Continentals across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington’s army was poor at tactics relative to British regulars, and the general knew it. Let’s play with history here a bit. Let us say we went back in time, put ourselves down in Washington’s headquarters in November 1776 – as his army was in tatters – and we told him of two famous aphorisms about counterinsurgency warfare from the modern world. First, that strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory but tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat. Second, that in an insurgency (like the American Revolution) the insurgent wins if he doesn’t lose. I think Washington would have laughed at those two aphorisms. He would have scratched his head and said my big problem right now at this point in time is not strategy, but the simple fact that my army can’t fight effectively at the tactical level, and it has shown at such battles as Long Island in August 1776. He would have also been puzzled by the concept of simply not losing, for Washington knew that to maintain the morale of his army and the citizenry, there came a time when he needed to win a battle or two. I think he would have also said that at least in his war bad tactics could lose the war for him, and conversely that tactical excellence was a key component to rebel victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back to the present. If I had stuck with my model of the primacy of strategy over tactics it would have led me to a false understanding of Washington’s situation in late 1776 and the criticality of tactical performance of his army. I would have concluded that for Washington tactics simply didn’t matter, as long as he got his strategy right. In a sense this is what American counterinsurgency expert John Nagl, sometimes whimsically called a Coindinista by American investigative reporter Carl Prine, did in his 2005 book Learning to Eat Soup with a Knife: Counterinsurgency Lessons from Malaya and Vietnam. He constructed a model that said if an army learns and adapts following a certain set of steps, and if it has as a certain end point of learning – call it the perfection of population centric counterinsurgency – then it can win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that model in hand Nagl undertook a study of the British in Malaya and the United States in Vietnam. Using his model of organizational learning as a template Nagl concluded that the British in Malaya followed his model and therefore they won, and the American’s didn’t follow his model and therefore they lost. It is a strikingly clever and seductive conclusion and one that led many to take that very template and apply it to Iraq and Afghanistan. But it is also a conclusion that horribly distorts the past and one fundamentally not supported by primary evidence. In so trying to make his model work Nagl severely misinterpreted Clausewitz and Jomini. He then went on to distort history by characterizing 18th Century warfare as made up of single battles “that often decided a war.” Yet the historian is hard pressed to find even one example of such a battle that ended a war during that age. More importantly Nagl’s apparent addiction to his model led him to misunderstand the two wars of Malaya and Vietnam. In the former the concern of senior British leaders was never really about the Army’s performance but of the Malayan police. And in Vietnam, the primary evidence shows quite well that the American Army followed Nagl’s learning model to a tee, but the US still lost the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such are the perils of social scientific models when applied to the past in an attempt to explain it through history. In my journey back from the dark side and addiction of social scientific model through the study of history I believe that I have come to a more balanced understanding of the relationship between strategy and tactics in war. Generally speaking, history does show the importance of good strategy in war and that if it is not done right dubious results will often follow. But history also shows that bad tactics can cause a state to lose a war, or at least cause it to modify its original war aims. And I also think that in some historical cases one can find examples of where a war was fought with a faulty strategy but solid tactics from the start generated opportunities for strategy to reform itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I have jettisoned my rule-bound model of the primacy of strategy over tactics in war, I still believe that the problems America faces in Afghanistan today are widely tied to a broken strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington Post reporter Rajiv Chandrasekaran writes in his new book on Afghanistan, Little America, of a war fought by the United States that has seen buckets and buckets of wasted energy and effort, bungled military operations, dysfunctional command and organizational structures, and naïve, misguided priorities. To be sure the American war in Afghanistan has seen those things from the very start, just like in Iraq. But wars in general and the militaries that fight them are never models of efficiency – far from it. The Prussian philosopher of war Carl von Clausewitz in his seminal book, On War, first published in 1832, introduced the idea of “friction” in war. Since wars are fought between peoples and militaries with opposing wills in the realm of death and destruction, friction has the effect of making seemingly smooth running military organizations quite imperfect, and at times, dysfunctional. The American military in Afghanistan in this regard is no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider some examples from military history. In the American Civil War the Union Army’s command structure never produced efficient staffs at the higher levels to adequately convey orders and plans to subordinate units, and the Confederates were even worse. Nor did the Union Army prioritize its resources in the most efficient way throughout the war, as evident in its telegraph systems being concentrated solely at the highest levels of command and never really making their way down to where the telegraph could have assisted lower level commanders. Moreover, the Union Army, arguably, never really got its organizational structures for combat right. It never developed a powerful striking force of all arms that could exploit victories in battle to make them truly decisive. Union commanding General George Meade at Gettysburg had soundly defeated Lee’s army but since he lacked a powerful counteroffensive force of cavalry and infantry and artillery he could not destroy Lee’s Army through exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In World War II, prior to the Normandy invasion, the American Army under General Omar Bradley had badly conceived the use of airpower to destroy German defensive positions on the bluffs overlooking Omaha Beach. There was an assumption that American high-flying strategic bombers would pulverize the beach defensives so that when the 29th and 1st Infantry Divisions landed they would easily move off of the beach and on to the high ground. But airpower did not have the assumed effect so that the plan that the assaulting divisions carried out went dreadfully wrong, and there was a high payment in blood as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in both cases — the Union Army in the Civil War and the American Army at the Normandy landings — the wars were fought under a broader strategic framework that made sense. When a state gets its strategy right in war, problems with tactics, organizational structures and procedures, and even problems with generalship tend to be subsumed and improved within a functioning and rational strategy. The Union Army in the American Civil War and the American Army in World War II, to be sure, had their fair share of “friction” but good strategy smoothed those problems out in the end. What Chandrasekeran essentially exposes in his new book on the Americans in Afghanistan is nothing new in war: friction. But when a state fights a war under a botched strategy — as the United States is currently doing in Afghanistan — without that umbrella of a functioning strategy then such friction is exposed to, and laid bare with, nothing higher for cover. Without good strategy the flaws and dysfunction that Chandrasekeran exposes is seen as instrumental noise, but without the melody of music — good strategy — to make sense out of it and give it direction and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Sun Tzu never said “strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory but tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat,” he did actually say something similar in The Art of War about the meaning and relative worth of strategy and tactics in war: “All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer,” argued Sun Tzu, “but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with American strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan is that everyone could see the tactics of counterinsurgency, but as they saw them they also saw the strategy. And therein ultimately rests a profound point of which history teaches, and that can’t be reduced into a simplistic, social science rule. In some wars there may be times where tactics, in terms of relative importance, are more important than strategy. But as long as strategy is seen for what it is, and viewed in a separate light, then it can employ effectively tactical action. But let the two become one, as in Iraq and Afghanistan where it was not uncommon to hear pundits and generals referring to a “counterinsurgency strategy,” then we have lost the bubble on the proper relationship between tactics and strategy in war and the end result is nothing more than a hopeless strategic muddle that wastes blood and treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, Sun Tzu said another thing about the temporal aspect of war: “ There is no instance of a country having been benefited from prolonged warfare.” By merging the tactics of American counterinsurgency with strategy in Afghanistan, the United States has allowed its military to adhere to a tactical imperative of counterinsurgency — that counterinsurgency campaigns take a long, long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting in 2010 on how long the United States would be in Afghanistan, General Petraeus said, “this is the kind of fight we’re in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids’ lives.” With regard to his strategic assessment of Afghanistan relative to Sun Tzu’s aphorism of the perils of protracted war for states, General Petraeus was wildly off the mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time is a calculation of strategy, and good strategy in Afghanistan should have discerned long ago that such an investment of time combined with massive amounts of blood and treasure was simply not worth the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.militarystrategymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/73.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resources that the United States allocates to national security inspire awe. The precise amount spent annually is open to debate—among other things, the figure arrived at is impacted considerably by what percentage of national debt payments are counted (reflecting past spending) and how factors like equipment depreciation and pensions (which will impact future spending) are treated. In any case, however, the expenditures are staggering—sufficient, for example, to cover the entire cost of Alexander the Great’s bid for global hegemony many times over. Unlike Alexander’s Macedon, however, the United States does not typically win its wars anymore — the US military history of the past half century largely is a dismal tale of outright loss (the Vietnam War), de facto defeat (the Afghanistan War), and Pyrrhic-victory-at-best (the Iraq War). There are exceptions, of course — most notably, the 1991 Persian Gulf War, as well as are a variety of small wars against powers ranging from the minor to the microscopic; the latter category includes the Kosovo War, the invasions of Panama and Grenada, and similar operations. Nevertheless, the general arc is clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US armed services are an extraordinary strategic instrument, and have been throughout the period under discussion. The image of the US Army in Vietnam as a drug-addled rabble owes more to urban legends about the supposed ubiquity of officer “fraggings” and the script of the decidedly fictional Apocalypse Now than actual history. The US military, particularly the Army, did suffer discipline problems in the Vietnam era, mostly in the later years of the war with rear-echelon units and, especially, ones stationed outside of Vietnam itself. The services responded to this by implementing successful reforms that purged the ranks of troublemakers and reimposed discipline. Yet, the excellence of the US military itself does not guarantee strategic success; indeed, a paradox of the sort which Edward N. Luttwak described in his classic Strategy: The Logic of War and Peace bedevils Washington: because their military is such an impressive tool, American civilian leaders feel a great temptation to use it, and they do so too liberally, often without having carefully and realistically weighed the likely long-term consequences of military action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When fighting second and third-rate enemies, operational excellence generally is sufficient to avoid complete humiliation in the short-term; the US military is sufficiently competent that it has not allowed an enemy to win a major tactical victory since the Korean War. The Tet Offensive of 1968, though widely perceived as a defeat for the United States, in fact was perhaps its greatest battlefield victory of the conflict: the indigenous Viet Cong suffered a bloodletting from which it never recovered, and the revolution in the South effectively was crushed. From that point forward, keeping the war alive required ongoing very large-scale infiltration by North Vietnamese forces (People’s Army of Vietnam – PAVN). The Iraqi and Afghan enemies of the United States have failed even to win a dubious victory of the sort enjoyed by the Viet Cong: they have proven incapable of overwhelming all but the smallest US units. When they have attempted to do so, as the Taliban did in the early months of the Afghan conflict, they have suffered accordingly, as their efforts played directly to the defining US military strength from the Second World War onward: quickly bringing crippling firepower to bear against enemy targets. Thus, both Iraqi and Afghan insurgents had little choice but to rely on terroristic tactics, killing and wounding American troops through sniping, the planting of improvised explosive devices, and similar methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ending-wars-afghanistan-and-iraq&quot;&gt;Ending Wars: Afghanistan and Iraq&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inability of these foes to win large-scale battlefield victories against US forces, however, did not make strategic success impossible for them. Indeed, it could even be said to have encouraged them to focus their efforts on a dimension of war in which they enjoyed a singular advantage over Washington: time. The Vietnam and Afghanistan Wars are dissimilar in many obvious respects, but alike insofar as both involve the United States fighting an expeditionary war on foreign territory against non-great power foes. These circumstances clearly are distinct from those facing Washington in many of its other conflicts; for instance, the Second World War provides a vivid contrast. From mid-December 1941 onward, it was entirely obvious even to the most politically disinterested American that a crushing military and political victory was the only acceptable outcome to the war in which the United States had finally become formally engaged. The precise character of that victory might be debatable — whether something less than unconditional Axis surrender might be contemplated, for instance — but, in any case, the war must not end with either the Japanese Empire in command of the Western Pacific and the Rimland of Asia or a hostile Nazi superpower consolidating its control over the bulk of the resources, industry, and population of the European continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vietnam War was a more vague endeavor. Certainly, the United States government was attempting to prevent South Vietnam (more formally, the Republic of Vietnam – RVN) from falling to communist control, and — aside from the more radical elements of the left and the tiny surviving remnants of the isolationist right — there was broad public agreement that the United States should resist the spread of communism in general and Soviet and Chinese power in particular. Whether it was especially important that the RVN survive was, however, a rather more difficult question — indeed, over time discussion increasingly shifted away from the importance of the country itself and focused on whether its collapse would damage US credibility as a protecting power more generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motive for the US occupation of Afghanistan was plain — the Taliban’s refusal to surrender Osama Bin Laden and his associates in a prompt and appropriately contrite manner — but what precisely the United States is attempting accomplish now in that country is not altogether clear. The fantasy that Afghanistan could be turned into a stable democracy has long since evaporated. At this point, it seems that President Obama is repeating the experience of his predecessor Richard Nixon: saddled with a unpopular and apparently endless war which he did not begin, he is mainly trying to avoid national (and personal) disgrace and wind down US involvement on acceptable terms. President Nixon, however, was in a somewhat superior position for an ironic reason: he and his subordinate Henry Kissinger were negotiating the American exit from Vietnam with the icy leaders of a totalitarian enemy state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout most of the Vietnam conflict, the United States fought in a very constrained fashion. The Johnson Administration — deeply fearful of the possibility that China might enter the war and enamored of the notion that “graduated escalation” was the appropriate methodology for attaining US goals at minimal risk — always conducted the war diffidently. The United States even left much of Hanoi, not only the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) but also its most important industrial city, and the port of Haiphong, the key point of entry for the Soviet and Chinese war materiel that made the PAVN’s expeditionary conflict possible, untouched by its bombing campaign, despite having the ability to devastate both cities at will. Throughout most of his first term, the Nixon Administration was more assertive than Johnson’s in some respects — undertaking, for example, Operation Menu, the bombing of North Vietnamese troops and facilities in Cambodia in 1969-70; however, it largely continued the American policy of caution in the use of violence against the North. The results were as unimpressive as one might expect, but by early 1972, the Administration’s successful efforts to effect a rapprochement with China had given the president the confidence to increase the military pressure on Hanoi through efforts such as the mining of Haiphong Harbor and initiation of the Linebacker I bombing campaign, which hit a range of previously excluded targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Hanoi’s massive 1972 operational push (called the “Easter Offensive” by the Americans), was broken, with very heavy losses to the PAVN in both men and materiel. From August 1969 onward, Kissinger and his DRV counterpart, Le Duc Tho, had held secret negotiating sessions, but following the collapse of the offensive the prospects for a settled peace appeared especially promising. By October, the general outlines of a US-DRV peace agreement existed, but Hanoi remained cagy, still seeking favorable revisions and refusing to finalize an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 1972, Nixon won an impressive electoral victory over Democratic Party nominee George McGovern, but the president nevertheless was rightly concerned about the possibility that the incoming Congress, with Democratic majorities in both houses and a very strong Congressional “peace wing” which included many liberal Republicans, might undermine his efforts to achieve a favorable peace. At the same time, Saigon opposed any peace settlement that did not contain various concessions — such as the recognition of the South Vietnam as a separate, sovereign state by the DRV — that Hanoi certainly would not grant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given his temporarily strong but nonetheless precarious position, Nixon decided on the risky gambit of giving the DRV a very sharp shove — the massive Linebacker II bombing campaign. The campaign that occurred from 18-29 December (interrupted in the middle by a 36-hour stand-down for Christmas Day) was operationally devastating. The United States took significant losses — including the shooting down of fifteen B-52s and significant damage to several others — but North Vietnam was gravely wounded, its air defenses largely destroyed and its highly sophisticated logistics network (briefly) wrecked. Nixon’s gamble succeeded: in January 1973, the Paris Peace Accords were signed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no Afghan equivalent of the government in Hanoi: the forces undermining Afghan stability are a motley collection of tribal warlords, religious fanatics, drug lords, kleptocrats, Pakistani intriguers, and generic thugs. Many individual actors fall into more than one of these categories. Moreover, unlike the leadership of the DRV, many of them lack the intellectual discipline necessary to make prudent strategic decisions; the generals running Pakistan’s Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) appear to have a special genius for devising elaborate plots, which invariably backfire and cause chaos in Pakistan itself. Given all this, even if Obama possessed the will to unleash violence on a Nixonian scale, it would make no difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest equivalent to the DRV perhaps is the government of Pakistan, but of course it formally is a US ally. The practical reality is considerably more complex — Islamabad is more enemy than ally — but, even leaving aside all considerations of global diplomacy and US domestic political opinion, violence directed against the Pakistani government would be deeply counterproductive. The simple truth is that Afghan stability is not especially important to the overall security of the United States; however, Pakistani stability is important, particularly insofar as that country possesses a sizable nuclear arsenal which might fall into very unsavory hands if Pakistan collapses into anarchy. Thus, it would unwise to take any action that might fatally damage the chronically unhealthy government of Pakistan. Even if that worst-case scenario did not transpire, it would certainly be undesirable if one or more of the factions within Pakistan’s military leadership – angry and humiliated by US action – decided to ramp up their efforts to undermine US interests. The apparent links between the ISI and the terrorists who conducted the 2008 Mumbai attacks serve as a stark illustration of how spectacularly imprudent many Pakistani policymakers are; if sufficiently motivated, they might even attempt to organize attacks on US embassies or other targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from Pakistan, there is no potential negotiating partner remotely worthy of the name. The United States already has accepted the indignity of negotiating with the Taliban, but its efforts to negotiate an acceptable peace ultimately will prove futile. The Taliban is not a unified body, but rather a set of factions loosely united by ethnicity (as an instrument of Pashtun supremacism in Afghanistan), religious obscurantism, and a loathing of the West and its values. Even if a peace agreement is extracted from “the Taliban”, factional rivalry soon will render it worthless. Thus far, both the Obama Administration and its Republican opponents apparently are unwilling to accept – regardless of precisely how the US ends the war – that it already has been lost. American withdrawal (correctly) will be perceived globally as an operational retreat reflecting a strategic (and policy) failure — the collapse of the US effort to craft even a modestly convincing imitation of a modern, democratic, and secure Afghan state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was possible to craft a better outcome to Vietnam, and the Nixon Administration did so. The Paris Peace Accords hardly reflected a stunning US victory and, indeed, were somewhat embarrassing — particularly the tacit acceptance of a permanent PAVN presence in South Vietnam and the refusal of the DRV to recognize that country’s legitimacy — but their terms, if enforced, insured an (admittedly very imperfect) US strategic victory in Vietnam. The core US goal was the survival of a non-communist South Vietnam and the core DRV goal was the absorption of that country — therefore, at the time that the treaty was signed there was every reason to believe that the United States had won the Vietnam War, just as it had in essence won the Korean War. These were frustratingly incomplete victories, but ones that allowed for the survival of a weak post-colonial Asian ally confronted by a stronger communist counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Paris Peace Accords did not permit a continuing US military presence of the sort still ongoing in South Korea — but, given the US domestic political atmosphere of the time, the maintenance of a large US military force in South Vietnam would not have been feasible in any event. South Vietnam, however, was not without the ability to defend itself — the serious “Vietnamization” efforts of the Nixon era had shown considerable success. The Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) did not have the man-for-man fighting power of the US Army of the day, but neither did the PAVN. The question was whether it was good enough to insure the RVN’s survival even against an invasion on the scale of the 1972 Easter Offensive. The answer almost surely was “yes,” provided that two conditions were met: first, continued provision of ample financial and military aid to the South; second, direct US military intervention should the DRV ignore the Accords and mount a full-scale invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Vietnam, however, was then doomed by a bizarre series of events. The Nixon of January 1973 was a respected global statesman with a domestic stature sufficient to enforce the Accords militarily, if need be — but the Watergate scandal soon thereafter began to corrode his status radically. In June, a much-weakened Nixon was compelled to accept a (constitutionally very questionable, as it seriously constrained the president’s authority as the commander-in-chief) ban on the expenditure of funds for military operations in Southeast Asia after 15 August 1973. The following year he resigned office, and the 1974 Congressional elections resulted in a Congressional majority strongly inclined to starve Saigon of aid. As the PAVN offensive gained momentum in early 1975, President Gerald Ford faced a bleak choice. He could have ordered the American military to intervene on behalf of the RVN, thus directly challenging Congress’ attempt to hamstring the commander in chief. Doing so, however, would have caused the greatest US constitutional crisis since the Civil War. Alternately, he could observe helplessly as strategic gains made at the cost of tens of billions of dollars, and nearly 60,000 US (and hundreds of thousands of allied) lives were tossed away. When all factors, domestic and international, are considered, he probably was wise to choose the latter course. The fact that the US Congress obliged him to make the decision, however, was an act of shocking strategic irresponsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end game in Afghanistan of course will be radically different from that in Vietnam. Most likely, either the second Obama or first Romney Administration will continue the current policy of slowly winding down the war until, finally, it can quietly end US combat operations altogether (a concluding stage similar to the one in Iraq). Yet both conflicts reflect a central flaw running throughout US strategic culture: an unwillingness on the part of most US civilian policymakers to apply Clausewitzian analysis – applying military violence in a well-considered way and crafting an intelligent strategy that ultimately furthers US policy aims at an acceptable price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-american-anti-clausewitzism&quot;&gt;Conclusion: American Anti-Clausewitzism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might fairly describe US strategic culture as “Anti-Clausewitzian”, not in the sense that it has consciously rejected Clausewitz but that (aside from within the US military) there is very little appreciation of the need to apply force in a thoughtful manner, assessing the likely financial, diplomatic, and human costs of war and creating a strategy that realistically should result in desired ends being achieved at an acceptable price. This is what Colin S. Gray has dubbed “the Strategy Bridge”, and it is a calculation that has been critical to success in statecraft since before humans developed the written word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precisely why US strategic culture has developed this unhealthy characteristic is complex, reflecting both moral attitudes — most US policymakers find coldly rational discussions of warfare distasteful, preferring to couch discussions of interest in happy vagaries about “spreading democracy” and “American values” — and the tapestry of US history. It is clear, however, that the United States has not, throughout most of its history, been incapable of rationally connecting political ends and military means. Small, weak republics on the Eastern Seaboard of North America do not become continental superstates if they are incapable of using violence ruthlessly and effectively against a variety of foes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1975, a reasonable observer might argue that the outcome of the Vietnam War was an anomaly, the calamitous ultimate outcome of the strategic ineptitude of Lyndon Johnson and Robert McNamara and a collective madness that descended upon Capitol Hill as a result of anger at Nixon for Watergate and longstanding frustration with Saigon as an ally. In 2012, however, it is obvious that there is a strong continuing pattern of poor US strategizing regarding the use of military power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only was the strategy for Afghanistan unrealistic, but the planning for the invasion of Iraq also was deeply flawed. Saddam Hussein was a long-standing irritant and the desire to see him removed from power altogether understandable. However, the fact that the Bush Administration believed that declaring Iraq a democracy would somehow prevent civil war and block Iran from having enormous influence in the country was as delusional as its belief that Afghanistan could be transformed into a functional state. When one also considers the examples of the US intervention in Lebanon in the 1980s and the US war in Libya — an adventure whose consequences are still playing out — as well as ill-considered uses of force in the Balkans that were at least nominally successful thanks to the weakness of Serbia and Slobodan Milošević’s arrogance and strategic ineptitude, the flaws in US strategic culture are all too clear. Moreover, it should be noted that they are bipartisan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Luttwakian paradox, it is a long record of US historical success that has encouraged this more recent pattern of failure. Because the United States succeeded so impressively overall in its grand strategy from the War of Independence to the end of the Cold War — and the Vietnam debacle did not completely destroy US containment, which proved a good enough strategy to bring the competition with the Soviet Union to a peaceful end — “victory disease” has taken deep root in US strategic culture. The aforementioned impressiveness of the military instrument and the fact that, even now, the United States is so much more powerful than any of its rivals blind policymakers to the limitations on their ability to impose their will on sentient enemies who react to the use of force, often in a creative and surprising manner. Victory disease is a self-correcting condition; eventually patterns of failure become so clear that policymakers are compelled to acknowledge them, whereupon they modify their strategic behavior. The questions that have yet to be answered are how much additional damage the United States will inflict on its interests and how much more it will pay in blood and dollars before it ceases to act in this dysfunctional manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The victory of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) over the Guomindang (GMD) in the Chinese Civil War of 1946-49 offers a powerful lesson in strategic misfortune. The GMD’s decay, corruption, and failure to offer a persuasive hope for future prosperity in the aftermath of the horrors of the second Sino-Japanese War were certainly prominent factors in its defeat. But the GMD nonetheless had the military power and will to militarily crush the CCP, as it often did before the onset of sustained Japanese aggression in the late 1930s. Political failure may have weakened the GMD, but strategic failure in managing large land campaigns sealed its fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategy-of-destruction&quot;&gt;Strategy of Destruction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese Civil War is a powerful case study in the centrality of battle even in civil war. Ideology, popular mobilization, and governance were all important. But to heavily focus on these factors ignores Mao’s oft quoted maxim that “power grows out of the barrel of a gun.” European counterinsurgency theorists such as David Galula studied Mao, but rarely understood the centrality of battle to early 20th Century China’s strategic history. Guerrilla operations and peasant revolts sat alongside large-scale operations waged by those with European military training and ideas. Mastery of continental land warfare as well as guerrilla operations proved key to victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War motivated the Qing leaders to create a powerful and bureaucratic military organized around European lines with the aid of German advisors. The 1911 revolution was not won by mass mobilization; Sun Yat-Sen’s GMD was a secret society that focused its efforts on winning over intellectuals, economic elites, and soldiers in Qing military forces. Yuan Shikai, Marshal of the Qing’s forces, defected with his elite Beiyang Army to Sun’s side and tilted the military balance in favor of the rebels. A lack of political consensus over the structure and distribution of political power helped fragment the military balance and thus create the impetus for China’s infamous ‘warlord period’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides in the Chinese Civil War were also thoroughly familiar with European political-military ideas and training. German advisors instilled in warlord armies an appreciation of the importance of large infantry armies, artillery, and the necessity of controlling land forces with telegraphic communication and railroad transport. German influence may have been eventually eclipsed by the Soviets, but German ideas still figured strongly in GMD doctrine and operations. GMD and CCP political-military commanders both had military training in Europe and received training from Soviet advisors in the Whampoa Military Academy, before the White Terror suppression of CCP forces in Shanghai and beyond by the GMD that ended their putative alliance in the late 1920s. Both the GMD and the CCP adopted political commissar systems and were strongly influenced by the Soviet idea of the party army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, the GMD understood that the CCP posed an existential threat and committed to its destruction. It engaged in encirclement operations to search and destroy CCP forces, the success of which was aided by the CCP’s initial Leninist conception of a strategy of urban revolt. Mao and Zhu De worked in concert to develop an alternative strategy built around concepts of protracted war, guerrilla tactics, and political mobilization of the peasantry. The growth of base areas throughout China provided the impetus for the growth of the party army and the CCP’s distinctive military tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMD moved in the early 1930s to encircle and destroy the base areas, but were initially stymied. CCP forces responded by “luring the enemy into the deep,” tricking the GMD forces into overextending their supply lines and destroying individual enemy units. However, the success of these tactics must be qualified. GMD units often consisted of former warlord troops of uneven quality, and local revolts and Japanese encroachments harmed overall GMD ability to coordinate operations. When the GMD devoted its full attentions and resources to annihilating the CCP, it was remarkably successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GMD forces did not have to compete for the allegiance of the populace to defeat the CCP’s base area strategy. Rather, the GMD starved the CCP base areas of resources and nullified Mao’s famed tactics by refusing to be lured into the deep. Networks of blockhouses linked by communication nodes were constructed to exert GMD control, but this time GMD troops refused to overextend their lines. CCP guerrillas were starved of resources, and any CCP attempts to exert local control resulted in destruction by pinpoint artillery and aircraft bombing. The CCP found itself fighting offensively to survive, but doing so led to crushing military defeat in pitched battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final encirclement campaign severely reduced the CCP base areas. The GMD’s aggressive pursuit of the Communist remnants during the torturous Long March destroyed nine tenths of CCP military power. Were it not for the onset of Japanese aggression, it is quite likely that the GMD would have completely destroyed the weakened CCP forces. The Second Sino-Japanese War not only provided breathing room for the CCP, but also allowed the CCP the opportunity to finally compete for political authority on a national scale. CCP forces infiltrated behind Japanese lines to organize the masses against the Japanese and build up a power base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategy-of-consolidation&quot;&gt;Strategy of Consolidation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP modified its policies in order to make itself attractive to local economic elites while still seeking to lower the peasant’s burden. This politically adroit compromise enabled the CCP to play to peasant sympathies while also plying local landlords that would have otherwise supported the GMD. The increasing formalization and sophistication of the CCP’s command and control structure increased as it expanded rapidly in its base areas; it reached a peak strength of 1.27 million men under arms and 2.6 million militia members by the fall of 1945. The CCP, once regarded as yet another group of renegades with a propensity for redistributive violence, now became seen as patriots waging a virtuous struggle against the Japanese invader. The fact that the CCP’s major military efforts were largely failures did not matter, as the Communists rose while the GMD was pushed to the brink of extinction by the pressure of tackling the Japanese head-on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMD paid a high price for its efforts to maintain the prewar Chinese polity. It lost 2.4 million men, and some of its best officers perished in positional warfare against the Japanese onslaught. At war’s end, large pockets of territory remained under the control of Japanese troops, local puppet regimes, and the CCP. Even American aid was not enough to sustain the power of the sinking GMD state. The war destroyed 55 percent of industry and mining, 72 percent of shipping, and 96 percent of railway lines. Inflation in GMD territory rose to an annual average of 230 percent. The war shattered the GMD’s prewar evolution into a Soviet-style hierarchal party and the political necessity of compromising with local elites during the war led to substantial corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMD’s political failure to consolidate its control is heavily emphasized in the literature of the war, and for good reason. Years of warlordism, civil war, and the depredations of Japanese aggression had disrupted the political, social, and economic fabric of China. The GMD, challenged by the CCP’s competing nationalism, would have to demonstrate its competence in order to regain political control and legitimacy. But the GMD entered the postwar situation with a substantial lack of revenue, and the wartime disruption of China’s heavy industry resulted in substantial price increases. GMD reforms were crippled by a lack of understanding of modern monetary policy, though they were not totally without beneficial effect. Hyperinflation, unemployment, and indirect taxation all presented a dismal picture of government failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMD also failed to adapt to social changes, such as the rise of labor activism, autonomous peasant uprisings, revolts from traditionally oppressed groups, and the rise of a heavily nationalist and CCP-linked student movement. The war’s destruction of traditional markers of social cohesion and class status helped create a large group of elites willing to entertain visions of a China ruled by a power other than the GMD. The GMD found it initially easy to re-establish control in the countryside and handle peasant revolts with indirect rule through a combination of local elites and coercive law enforcement. But it did not understand the need to respond the deepening social crisis in the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMD strategy of attempting to gain control of large urban centers ran into severe difficulty as factional infighting, predatory local officials, and lack of governing capacity hindered efforts to rebuild. By 1948, total economic collapse had devastated the middle class, bankrupted businessmen, and severely disrupted the GMD’s elite power base. Once-tight party control eroded, and the circle of elites willing to fight for the GMD narrowed. The CCP deftly exploited these difficulties by mobilizing the urban middle class, students, and labor to frustrate the GMD’s political control of the cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP, however, could also be quite ruthless and at times equally inept at the task of extending its authority. The CCP’s success at radical land reform among the peasantry can best be described as mixed. Land reform’s quality varied, led to political conflicts, and most peasants simply sought to survive rather than take sides. Some even resisted the CCP’s efforts to violently overturn the prewar political and social order. More important was the CCP’s ability to create local order, manipulate local elites, and militarize its areas of operation. When it succeeded, the CCP did so by adapting to local conditions and promising all things to all men. When it failed, it was because of overzealous ideological mobilization and lack of attention to the needs of the locals. The CCP succeeded not necessarily in generating a giant peasant army, but in gaining a base for supply and support. It gained enough recruits to sustain its losses and wage a civil war on a continental scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategy-of-victory&quot;&gt;Strategy of Victory&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the GMD’s manifold political failures, it held one crucial trump card: the power of battle. As in the encirclement campaigns, the GMD had the raw military power to crush the CCP. Without eliminating the GMD’s forces, including an elite group of American-trained units, the CCP could not win the civil war. Its liberated areas depended on military support to survive. In spite of its losses and economic mismanagement, the GMD’s armed forces had grown larger and the party continued to hold international recognition. Crucially, the GMD military could also count on American and British assistance for air and naval transport. The CCP, in contrast, could count on sporadic support at best, from Moscow. In 1945 the GMD, despite its setbacks, controlled three quarters of the country, 300 million people, all large cities, and transportation hubs. Its ranks boasted 4.3 million troops, including 2 million regulars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP was not prepared for Japan’s sudden collapse in 1945, but the GMD could deftly exploit it. Japan’s strategic defeat, and the subsequent power vacuum it created, complicated the CCP’s slow efforts to create guerrilla bases in south and central China and develop a positional defense of the emerging CCP mini-state in the north. If successful, the plan would force the GMD into engaging in counterinsurgency in the south while contending with mobile warfare in the north. Japan’s sudden collapse caught the CCP in the middle of the process, before either front was ready for battle. The GMD used Allied transport to rapidly move its forces into north China, prompting the CCP to engage in a mad dash to prevent GMD expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic decision that helped save the CCP was actually made by Mao’s subordinate, Liu Shaoqi. Abandoning the prewar plan, Liu shifted the CCP’s best troops into the northeast, gaining Manchuria and shortening CCP lines in the south. As one group of forces moved to the northeast in Manchuria, CCP units once tasked to the south would abandon their bases and move north to Shandong, Jiangsu, and Hebei. These maneuvers established Manchuria as a logistical base that could supply the war effort nationally. Nevertheless, the plan also immediately ran into problems. Building a base of support in northeast China had proved more difficult than Liu expected. In addition to political problems with the area’s populace, the GMD dispatched strong units to the area to contest the CCP’s presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1946 found the CCP still struggling in Manchuria and thwarted in their quest to establish a safe rear area for the liberated areas in north China, along the Yellow River. The GMD unleashed its American-trained elite units and succeeded in severely disrupting CCP military forces in Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong and trapping CCP armies in the east. Meanwhile, offensives continued in the north and northeast. Yet at this point, the GMD, failing to notice the problems inherent in its failure to destroy Communist armies in the field, assumed that it had secured Shanxi, Suiyan, Chahar, Anhui, Rehe, and the Central Plains as well as the majority of Jiangsu, Hebei, and Manchuria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the GMD decided to embark on the Strong Point offensive, an attempt to destroy the CCP’s political apparatus to the west in Yan’an as well as the trapped CCP army in the east. The Strong Point offensive was based on the tenuous assumptions that the GMD had secured its conquered territory and could afford to shift its effort away from the northeast and northern theaters. It failed to finish off the CCP, even though it came close enough that the party headquarters in Yan’an were evacuated. By the end of the Strong Point offensive in 1947, the CCP still had its strategic base in the northeast, and the GMD had failed to fully pacify a single region or completely destroy the Communist mobile armies. The GMD’s strategic reserves were exhausted, and it lacked the resources to properly defend all of its gains. The GMD held the coastline and all of the major cities and railroads from Shaanxi to Shandong, but this counted for little as long as Communist armies remained intact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMD had failed to consolidate control over northeast and northern areas in Manchuria, Hebei, and Shanxi, while shifting the bulk of GMD forces to Shandong in the east and Shaanxi to the west. Fatally overextended, the GMD’s strength was primarily concentrated on the flanks and thus was ripe for an offensive in the center. With northeast and northern areas still in play and the bulk of GMD strength concentrated in Shandong and Shaanxi, the CCP successfully disrupted GMD defenses with its Central Plains offensives. The shock of watching a CCP army infiltrate deep behind enemy lines south of the Yellow River forced the GMD to strip Shandong, Manchuria, and north China of their defenses to shore up its center. Decisive battles in the northeast and Central Plains were now possible for the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 1948, the GMD had failed to gain anything more than a foothold in Manchuria, was tied down in the center and was struggling to combat counteroffensive operations in both Manchuria and the north. Meanwhile, military reorganization, improvements in weaponry, the mobilization of peasants and conscription of captured GMD soldiers allowed the CCP to transform itself into an organization truly capable of decisive mobile warfare. Collapse would come rapidly in three decisive campaigns in the northeast, north, and the Central Plains. These three campaigns would destroy GMD military power and allow the CCP to sweep over the rest of continental China. Perhaps the most notable was the Huai-Hai campaign, which stretched over 7,600 square miles and involved a million combatants. The CCP encircled and destroyed the bulk of the GMD forces in a single blow, triggering a political crisis that would mark the beginning of the end for the Republic of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-strategic-misfortune&quot;&gt;A Strategic Misfortune?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMD’s economic mismanagement, corruption, and various failures in the countryside certainly cost it heavily, but the CCP’s social initiatives had mixed effects throughout its base areas and at most allowed it to stay in the game rather than win outright. Failure to crush the CCP in the 1930s allowed it to survive and grow, and strategic failures in the mid-1940s squandered the GMD’s superior position. The GMD’s bad policies may have been synergistic with its military failures, but those military failures doomed it to strategic defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMD proved incapable of managing a war fought on a truly continental scale, overextending its forces and exhausting its reserve. It could not hold the areas it took and failed to focus on the enemy armies rather than the territories they held. The center of gravity was not people or territory, but the political power that grew out of Mao’s guns. GMD strategic misfortune was the cause, not the consequence, of the birth of the People’s Republic of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feature-1-what-are-the-key-strengths-of-the-china-russia-relationship&quot;&gt;Feature 1: What Are the Key Strengths of the China-Russia Relationship?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature explores how the China-Russia relationship came to be so close, up until the time of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The analysis centers on five key ways in which China benefits from the relationship, each of which is examined in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key strengths highlighted in this feature is the strong personal relationship between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Since he became China’s president in 2013, Xi has met with Vladimir Putin 39 times, which is more than double the number of times Xi has met with leaders of any other major power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feature-2-what-are-the-weaknesses-of-the-china-russia-relationship&quot;&gt;Feature 2: What Are the Weaknesses of the China-Russia Relationship?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature explores key areas of uncertainty and weak points within the China-Russia relationship. While ties between Beijing and Moscow are currently close, there are areas of tension and uncertainty within the relationship. One potential long-term stressor on the relationship is the growing power disparity between the two countries, as China solidifies its position as the more “senior” partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is most visible with respect to economic power. China’s GDP has already far outpaced Russia’s, and the gap between the two is set to widen as China’s GDP is expected to climb toward nearly $30 trillion in the coming years, while Russia’s is forecasted to stagnate at well under $2 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feature-3-how-does-china-benefit-from-military-cooperation-with-russia&quot;&gt;Feature 3: How Does China Benefit from Military Cooperation with Russia?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This forthcoming feature will assess Chinese and Russian military cooperation, a crucial element of the broader bilateral relationship. One key area of China-Russia military cooperation that will be examined in this feature is military exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two countries conducted their first joint military exercise in 2005, with another four exercises between 2007 and 2012. Starting in 2013, however, China and Russia significantly ramped up their participation in bilateral and multilateral exercises with each other. Through 2021, they have held a total of 53 military exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye out for this feature to learn more about how China and Russia benefit from these military exercises, as well as other forms of military cooperation, such as arms sales.&lt;/p&gt;

The idea is built on the basic principles established in NATO’s first strategic concept in 1949.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;There are three ways to develop the Framework Nations Concept:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop the existing frameworks led by the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy.&lt;/strong&gt; Each provides opportunities for the enhanced regional focus and leadership NATO needs. In doing so, several insights from the development of the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force may be useful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop new regional frameworks.&lt;/strong&gt; Initial groups that could be examined include the Black Sea, the Mediterranean, the Western Balkans, and Central Europe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop new thematic frameworks.&lt;/strong&gt; Initial groups that could be examined include those based on existing Centers of Excellence, cyber, special operations forces, and air and missile defense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It has been said that “framework nation arrangements were an indispensable component of NATO’s cohesion and successful record of deterrence during the Cold War.” If NATO can improve its existing frameworks and develop new ones — both regional and thematic — while managing the challenges and risks, the framework nations idea may become indispensable once again in NATO’s new era of defense and deterrence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) leaders gather in Madrid this month to unveil the eighth strategic concept the alliance has adopted since the Washington Treaty was signed in 1949. The Madrid summit comes at a crucial moment in NATO’s history. In response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and stated intent to overturn the existing security order in Europe, the alliance has committed to “resetting” its long-term approach. In preparing to endorse their latest vision, its leaders may wish to return to the alliance’s first concept for inspiration. That document set out a series of “defense principles” that endure to this day. One, in particular, stands out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A basic principle of North Atlantic Treaty planning should be that each nation should undertake the task, or tasks, for which it is best suited. Certain nations, because of the geographic location or because of their capabilities, will appropriate specific missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This principle can be seen today throughout NATO’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It has deployed elements of the NATO Response Force (NRF), bolstered existing Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP) missions, and added four new multinational battlegroups, transforming its presence across Eastern Europe. The nations that host and contribute to these missions do so “because of the geographic location or because of their capabilities” — whether British armor in Estonia, U.S. missile defense in Poland, or French air defense and armored vehicles in Romania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specialization that has bolstered NATO’s reassurance and deterrence efforts in the wake of Russia’s invasion is the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF). The JEF is a group of 10 nations including Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden and led by the United Kingdom. Due to their common geographical identity, the JEF is focused on security and defense in Northern Europe. In the wake of Russia’s invasion, the JEF has coordinated military activity, held a leaders summit in London attended virtually by President Volodymyr Zelensky, and deployed forces and a military headquarters to the Baltic region for the first time. The JEF is an example of NATO’s Framework Nations Concept (FNC), established at the Wales Summit in 2014 to encourage multinational groups within the alliance to develop deployable capabilities, led by a “framework nation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether through the NRF, EFP, multinational battlegroups, or FNCs such as the JEF, NATO’s response to the new European security environment shows the benefits of pursuing a model where nations undertake the tasks to which they are “best suited.” This paper explores whether NATO should do more beyond Madrid to harness the benefits of one of its founding principles through improving the FNC. It does so in three parts. First, it recaps the genesis of FNCs and their basis in NATO’s history. Second, it analyses the UK-led JEF model in more detail to draw out lessons and insights for developing the FNC. Finally, it looks beyond the JEF to consider the development of other FNCs — both existing and new (regional and thematic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;natos-fnc-back-to-basics&quot;&gt;NATO’s FNC: Back to Basics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Wales summit in 2014, NATO’s leaders endorsed the FNC, which encouraged groups of nations within NATO to come together to “work multinationally for the joint development of forces and capabilities required by the Alliance, facilitated by a framework nation.” Three framework nation groups were established, led by the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of “framework nations” was to address persistent political and military shortfalls among NATO’s European members. Some of these had been revealed when they struggled to conduct air operations without significant assistance from the United States over Libya in 2011 under Operation Unified Protector. It was also designed to capitalize on the hard-fought experience allies gained operating together under NATO’s International Security Assistance Force framework in Afghanistan. At the time, Anders Fogh-Rasmussen, then NATO secretary general, argued for European NATO nations to increase their “deployable and sustainable capabilities, as well as mustering the political resolve to use them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;regional-specialization&quot;&gt;Regional Specialization&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thinking behind framework nations harked back to the basic defense principle of regional specialization outlined in NATO’s first strategic concept. When the first strategic concept was endorsed in 1949, this principle was immediately put into action. NATO’s military authorities stood up five Regional Planning Groups (RPGs) to produce local contingency plans for defense against Soviet aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The five original RPGs were: Western Europe, Northern Europe, Southern Europe and the Mediterranean, the North Atlantic Ocean, and Canada-United States. The European RPGs were phased out from 1951, when NATO introduced a new integrated command structure and stood up Allied Command Europe. The Canada-U.S. RPG remained, while the North Atlantic RPG became Allied Command Atlantic. The importance of the regionalized approach was made clear in a 1951 planning memorandum that phased out the RPGs: “The Northern Region has been specifically asked to make plans for operations in the Baltic . . . an essential factor of the sea/land complex of Northern Europe.” These plans would be delegated to the commander-in-chief of Allied Forces Northern Europe, who would take over regional planning. The origins of the FNC can therefore be traced back to NATO’s original RPGs, with the JEF being rooted in the Northern Europe RPG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;mutual-coordination&quot;&gt;Mutual Coordination&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s first strategic concept also set out another basic principle of defense planning that the framework nations concept seeks to exploit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The armed forces of those nations so located as to permit mutual support in the event of aggression should be developed on a coordinated basis in order that they can operate most economically and efficiently in accordance with a common strategic plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of mutual coordination was to achieve “maximum efficiency of their armed forces, with the minimum necessary expenditures.” At the time of NATO’s founding, this was a major concern for the allies for two reasons: economic recovery from the war and the strength of Soviet forces. These two concerns dominated again prior to NATO’s Wales summit in 2014, when the FNC was conceived and endorsed due to ongoing policies of austerity among allies and Russia’s seizure of Ukrainian territory by force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures taken in Wales were designed to respond “to the challenges posed by Russia and their strategic implications” by exploiting the efficiencies of mutual coordination. While the 2012 “Smart Defense” was designed to encourage efficiency through joint equipment procurement and capability development, the FNC took this idea further. It adopted a wider view that nations with “regional ties” and long-established traditions of working together could coordinate their training, exercising, interoperability, doctrine, and operational formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mutual coordination through regional ties enables nations that prefer to work together to formalize and develop those relations under NATO’s umbrella. For example, the idea of the JEF allies being “like-minded” was central to its appeal, with the JEF even described by one defense minister as a “Force of Friends.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Framework nations also recognized that not all nations were equal: not every ally was able and willing to take leadership roles. Larger nations capable of doing so could gain practical and reputational benefits by leading coalitions, while smaller nations could benefit from being part of regional formations. As one analyst suggests, FNC “represents probably the most evolved form to date of matching the capabilities and contributions of larger and smaller European Allies.” This did not mean smaller allies contributed less; instead, they did so proportionately to their means, in the spirit of NATO’s basic principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that “applications of framework nation arrangements among the Allies are almost as old as NATO itself.” The development of the JEF and its utility, particularly in recent months, shows the benefits of this approach in practice in NATO’s contemporary environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;jef-putting-the-fnc-into-practice&quot;&gt;JEF: Putting the FNC into Practice&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF is perhaps the leading example of the FNC in practice. The war in Ukraine has seen the JEF evolve beyond the aims set by NATO leaders in Wales to become a political-military entity in its own right. The JEF’s development since 2014 may therefore provide inspiration for the future of framework nations in NATO beyond Madrid and the next strategic concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom’s intent to form the JEF was originally declared in a 2012 speech by then chief of the defense staff, General Sir David Richards: “The JEF will be of variable size; a framework into which others fit.” It was conceived and “designed to meet our NATO obligations,” based on the experience of Libya, where “Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were able to play a vital role by bringing their regional expertise into the command structure of a NATO operation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF established its own political momentum through a letter of intent signed on the same day as the Wales summit by the original seven members, followed by a formal memorandum of understanding (MOU) in 2015. Leadership of the JEF was cemented as a UK priority in its 2015 defense review as part of the United Kingdom’s policy of becoming “international by design.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first dedicated JEF exercise was held in 2016 and involved 1,600 troops and all seven partner nations. During the sequel, in 2017, Sweden and Finland joined the JEF, increasing the group to nine nations and adding another dimension by bringing non-NATO members into the framework. On June 28, 2018, a new MOU formally declared the JEF able to “deploy over 10,000 personnel from across the nine nations.” Iceland joined in 2021, after which the 10 JEF nations issued a new policy directive “designed to provide the overarching policy framework within which the JEF can evolve as a concept and operate as a force, across a broad spectrum of operational activity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since becoming operational in 2018, the JEF has conducted a variety of exercises and deployments. In 2019, a JEF maritime task group led by HMS Albion conducted Exercise Baltic Protector in the Baltic Sea, alongside “covert amphibious raids, urban ambushes and counter-mine training” with partner JEF nations. In 2021, the JEF conducted its first operational deployment in the Baltic Sea to reassure allies in the region, with Royal Navy frigates leading vessels from all three Baltic states. JEF nations also took part that year in Exercise Joint Protector in Sweden to exercise and develop their responses to hybrid threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the JEF has come to the fore of Europe’s response to Russia in a wider role. The JEF has proven itself as a useful political-military format for its members. In February, JEF leaders met in Sweden (military chiefs) and Belvoir Castle in England (defense ministers), and leaders convened a virtual summit the day after the invasion. On March 15, 18 days into the war, President Zelensky joined another JEF leaders meeting. JEF leaders declared their support for “significant economic and humanitarian support in response to the deteriorating situation in Ukraine and the region,” measures that have been taken “directly, and through multilateral organisations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JEF militaries have also been working together to deliver “a series of integrated military activities across our part of northern Europe — at sea, on land and in the air.” These have included joint maritime patrols between British, Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian, and Danish ships; exercises with Swedish and Danish fighter aircraft; resupply of the NATO battlegroup in Estonia and freedom of navigation patrols; the Baltic Protector JEF maritime task group led by the HMS Defender; Exercise Hedgehog and combat air patrols in Estonia; arctic operations in Norway; Exercise Mjolner in the Baltic Sea; and tank warfare training on Exercise Arrow in Finland. Most recently, the JEF deployed its standing military headquarters for the first time to Lithuania and Latvia, a deployment that includes “over 220 personnel, from the UK and other JEF nations, including specialists in cyber, space and information operations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;what-lessons-nato-can-learn-from-the-jef&quot;&gt;What Lessons NATO Can Learn from the JEF&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to British prime minister Boris Johnson, the JEF has proven itself to be “a very, very useful, dynamic format.” But what lessons can NATO take from the JEF’s development and employment since 2014 to develop the FNC beyond Madrid? The survey above suggests several features that have helped develop the JEF that could be applied by NATO to other FNCs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a clear vision.&lt;/strong&gt; The Wales summit vision for the JEF was clear: “a rapidly deployable force capable of conducting the full spectrum of operations.” This simple vision has guided the development and activities of the JEF through training, exercising, deployment, and policy development. In comparison, the original aims set in Wales for the German-led FNC (to create “a number of multinational projects to address Alliance priority areas across a broad spectrum of capabilities”) and the Italian-led FNC (to “focus on improving a number of Alliance capability areas”) are less focused.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a regional focus.&lt;/strong&gt; The JEF’s vision and role has also focused on the Northern European area of the High North, North Atlantic, and Baltic Sea region. While the JEF retains the ambition to act further afield if its members so wish, this focus on meeting, first and foremost, the security challenges of Northern Europe provides a natural incentive for its members to cooperate and pursue a cohesive approach and common identity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build on existing foundations.&lt;/strong&gt; The JEF also exploits the common political and military-strategic foundations of its members, which are founded on shared operational experience and common values. The political cohesion of JEF nations is a function of the “like-mindedness” of JEF allies, bolstered by common political entities such as the Northern Group and NORDEFCO. The military-strategic lineage of the JEF in NATO’s original Northern European Regional Planning Group — and its successors post-1951 within NATO’s integrated command structure — also contributes to its identity. Another example of the contemporary relevance of these constructs is the recent formation of NATO’s Atlantic Command (located in Norfolk, Virginia), the lineage of which can be traced to the original North Atlantic Ocean RPG, via SACLANT (formed in 1952). In this regard, the three other original RPGs — focused on Western Europe, Southern Europe and the Mediterranean, and the Canada-U.S. region — may provide natural foundations for NATO to develop further FNCs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a political identity and brand.&lt;/strong&gt; The clear vision, regional focus, and common foundations of the JEF have enabled the formation of a political identity. Although the foundations were already in place, the JEF nations have sought to develop and display their political cohesion through consistent high-level meetings, public statements, letters of intent, MOUs, political directives, and strategic communication campaigns to reinforce the JEF brand (see Figure 3 below). This serves to reinforce the group’s political identify and can have powerful effects. For example, one analyst suggests that the provision of security assurances by the United Kingdom to Finland and Sweden prior to their official announcements to seek NATO membership “could happen quickly, mainly because Helsinki and Stockholm have built trust with London working together in the British-led Joint Expeditionary Force.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refine the membership.&lt;/strong&gt; The JEF has grown since 2014 from the original 7 members to 10, adding Finland and Sweden in 2017 and Iceland in 2021. New members add strength and capacity in both political and military-strategic terms. The addition of Finland and Sweden also demonstrated in practice how “the JEF is designed with flexibility at its heart” by including non-NATO partners in a NATO-born initiative. However, a balance is required: too many members risks diluting purpose and regional focus and undermining agility and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a constant drumbeat of activity.&lt;/strong&gt; The JEF has delivered a regular program of activity since its inception, ranging from large scale dedicated exercises such as the annual Baltic Protector series to smaller presence and logistics operations conducted under a JEF banner. The main benefit of doing this is to develop the interoperability and readiness of JEF forces to work together in a crisis. Another benefit is to drive development through a continuous cycle of exercising, development, and political direction (JEF national policy directors and ministers also meet regularly). This constant drumbeat of activity, which is called for by the JEF policy direction, is set to continue with new operations and exercises scheduled this year and next.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set out clear policy direction.&lt;/strong&gt; The JEF published its policy direction in 2021, accompanied by a classified “military JEF Directive that includes clear Military Strategic Objectives.” This follows NATO’s model of publishing its strategic concepts (since 1991) while developing classified detailed military-strategic guidance. The benefit of this model is to raise public awareness of the JEF’s purpose and remit. It also signals to allies and adversaries the commitment and solidarity of the partner nations to an agreed set of principles for the JEF’s development and employment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emphasize framework nation leadership.&lt;/strong&gt; For the FNC to work, the framework nation must lead. This responsibility is political as well as operational. The United Kingdom has invested significant political capital and military resources in the JEF since its inception. For example, it hosts the JEF’s deployable headquarters, and the lead force elements on JEF operations and training are usually British. Doing this serves a purpose for the United Kingdom by enhancing its reputation and contributing to the government’s flagship “Global Britain” agenda. But the JEF partner nations also benefit from UK leadership through being part of a viable regional security framework.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be flexible and relevant.&lt;/strong&gt; As well as flexibility in membership across institutional boundaries, the JEF is also designed to be operationally flexible across “the full spectrum of operations, including high intensity operations.” The plethora of JEF operations conducted in the Baltic region in recent weeks to reassure allies and deter aggression demonstrates relevance. So does the use of the JEF as a political-military forum to coordinate regional responses to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and support for President Zelensky. The JEF’s ability to evolve with the security environment is even enshrined with its policy direction: “As the security challenges we face evolve, so must we, as JEF Participants, continue to evolve our own capabilities and how we employ them.” One example of this is the JEF’s new focus on “sub-threshold” competition and hybrid threats through adapting its policy, doctrine, and exercising.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These lessons are used in Figure 4 to assess the progress made by the German and Italian-led FNCs established in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/220627_Monaghan%20_Figure4_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Best Practices for Implementing the FNCs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-next-for-natos-fnc-is&quot;&gt;What Next for NATO’s FNC Is&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine and renewed threat to NATO and European security, NATO is resetting its defense and deterrence posture. This should include developing the alliance’s FNC beyond the Madrid summit. As two German analysts put it, “the FNC can become the key instrument to shape Europe’s defense structure.” Doing so will require two tasks: making the most of existing FNC initiatives and developing new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;making-the-most-of-existing-fncs&quot;&gt;Making the Most of Existing FNCs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Germany&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war on Ukraine has already transformed Germany’s defense and security policy. On February 27, German chancellor Olaf Scholz made his now infamous zeitenwende (“turning point”) speech that overturned decades of Germany policy. Its two principal commitments were to establish a €100 billion ($104 billion) special defense fund for immediate investments in military capabilities and to invest more than 2 percent of GDP on defense (from fiscal year 2022–2023). If followed through, these commitments will soon make Germany the largest defense spender in Europe. As German defense and security ambitions increase, so should the ambition and scope of the FNC it leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the zeitenwende is not just about spending more on defense. It also requires a cultural shift within the government and the military to successfully transform German defense policy. Indeed, the German government has already found the implementation of the zeitenwende far more difficult than the political decision and statement. Therefore, investing in and developing this FNC can help Germany itself develop as a European security actor alongside allies and partners. As the Bundeswehr’s own white paper stated in 2016: “Germany is willing to assume responsibility and leadership as a framework nation in alliances and partnerships.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany’s FNC could also be a useful vehicle for addressing some of its allies’ concerns about Germany’s past reluctance to commit forces to multinational operations. Furthermore, it may repair some of the reputational damage for the country’s perceived lack of support for Ukraine and past foreign policy toward Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany’s FNC has a dual focus: (1) to form capability development clusters with a broad remit, including logistics support; chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear protection; and deployable headquarters, and (2) to build larger multilateral military formations. The second task that is now the most valuable for the defense of Europe, which is why Germany expanded the FNC in 2015 to include the generation of follow-on forces to bolster NATO’s Readiness Action Plan. Germany also already acts as a framework nation in several European force constructs, including the 1st German-Netherlands Corps, the 11-nation Eurocorps, and NATO’s Multinational Corps North East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the lessons identified from the JEF’s development, Germany’s FNC is doing well in some areas (see Figure 4 below). The membership has grown from 10 to 20, bolstered by the urgency of the task combined with Germany’s leadership role across other multinational constructs. The expansion of the FNC to provide NRF follow-on forces has demonstrated flexibility and relevance. The FNC’s membership and regional focus builds on NATO’s original Western Europe RPG and other regional political groups such as the Central European Defence Cooperation framework. That said, Germany’s FNC seems to lack a clear vision, a political identity and brand, a constant drumbeat of activity, and transparent political direction. Its dual purpose and large membership also threaten to dilute the purpose and identity of the FNC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The promise of Germany’s FNC, combined with changes in its defense policy and leadership role, gives it substantial development potential. If its purpose can be streamlined and a clear identity established, the Madrid summit presents an excellent political opportunity for Germany to use its FNC to help fulfil its leadership potential at the heart of NATO and European defense and security writ large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Italy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to one analysis, the Italian-led FNC “is considerably less ambitious and tangible than that of the other two FNC groups.” Its six members originally focused on stabilization, reconstruction, provision of enablers, and rapidly deployable command structures. In 2018, the group remodeled itself with a new goal to enhance cooperation, interoperability, operational output, collaborative capability development, and the establishment of multinational formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Italian FNC seems to be less advanced in terms of the JEF lessons (see Figure 4 for more detail). It lacks a clear vision, identity and brand, transparent political direction, and leadership initiatives from Rome. As such, its activity appears sporadic. Unlike the JEF and the German group, this group is yet to increase its membership. That said, the group was “completely renovated through a brand-new overall approach” in 2018. This was “part of a wider process to strengthen the ITA-FNC initiative aimed at consolidating further cohesion.” This renovation should help the Italian FNC build on its regional focus and its common foundations — through NATO’s original Southern Europe and Mediterranean RPG and political groups such as the Defence Cooperation Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the relevance of the Italian FNC, one of its original focus areas — stabilization operations — remains critical to the alliance for three reasons. First, the immediate NATO lessons-learned process for Afghanistan concluded that crisis management should remain a core task. Second, this lessons-learned process was conducted too quickly to gain a full understanding of 20 years of stabilization and reconstruction missions in Afghanistan. Therefore, there remains a rich source of data to fully analyze to develop these lessons, in conjunction with NATO’s Security Force Assistance Centre of Excellence and Civil-Military Cooperation Centre of Excellence, and formalize this into standardized NATO doctrine for future operational use. Third, Russian destabilizing activities in Africa, through Wagner Group mercenaries, has fragmented and disrupted European operations within the Sahel. This activity will likely have consequences for the security of Europe, meaning a potentially larger role for NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;establishing-new-regional-fncs&quot;&gt;Establishing New Regional FNCs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the war in Ukraine, NATO has already doubled its multinational battlegroups from four to eight. These deployments are managed on a framework nation basis. Yet in addition to the defense of Europe and deterrence of Russian aggression, NATO should also address regional security issues to provide “360-degree security.” The Madrid summit is an opportune moment to begin feasibility studies to further develop regional FNCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;black-sea&quot;&gt;Black Sea&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The priority for an additional FNC is in the Black Sea region, where Russian domination leads to insecurity. Moreover, the Black Sea has increased in prominence due to its critical role for the Ukrainian economy and global food supply, in addition to upholding the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea. With NATO’s Tailored Forward Presence in Bulgaria and Romania already reinforced, there is a gap for a NATO maritime presence in the Black Sea. However, selecting the lead nation for the group may be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom has significant interest in the Black Sea and has sent nine Royal Navy missions there since 2017 under Operation Orbital to assist Ukraine. In 2021, HMS Defender was aggressively shadowed by Russian ships while conducting freedom of navigation operations off the coast of Crimea. The United Kingdom has also created Littoral Response Group North to operate across the Euro-Atlantic region. However, considering its JEF leadership role and specialist capabilities that are best suited to Northern Europe, leading an FNC in the Black Sea might overstretch UK capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both France and Turkey would naturally be best placed to lead, if political tensions between the two can be managed following the formation of a bilateral Franco-Greek defense pact in 2021. France, now leading the NATO multinational battlegroup in Romania, could extend its security provision to the Black Sea and leverage its significant naval capabilities. Turkey should be involved due to its geostrategic importance through control of access to the Black Sea. Other contributing nations could be drawn from regular participants in NATOs annual Black Sea Exercise BREEZE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;mediterranean&quot;&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean Sea, as Europe’s southern flank and linked to the Black Sea, would be the next priority for a regional FNC. France and Italy, who regularly conduct large exercises with the U.S. Navy, including France deploying its Charles de Gaulle carrier task force, would be the most suitable lead nations. Moreover, both have experience operating in the Mediterranean as part of NATO’s Operation Unified Protector against Libya in 2011. Alongside Spain and Greece, both nations have significant security concerns emanating from the south, such as terrorism, organized crime, and illegal migration. Alternatively, NATO could build an enhanced FNC around its extant Standing NATO Maritime Group 2, which also operates within the Black Sea. Security challenges from the south are also shared with the European Union, and the flexibility of FNCs should allow greater interoperability with external structures and capabilities, such as the EU border and coast guard agency FRONTEX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;western-balkans&quot;&gt;Western Balkans&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Western Balkans continue to be a potential flashpoint for conflict that is vulnerable to Russian influence. The importance of the Balkans remaining stable is underlined by three continuing European missions: NATO’s KFOR in Kosovo since 1999, EUFOR ALTHEA in Bosnia Herzegovina since 2004, and EULEX Kosovo since 2008. Regional, political, and historical sensitivities mean that NATO member states of Croatia, Montenegro, Albania, and North Macedonia should have a leading role for any FNC, supported by other European nations with a deep interest in stability in the Balkans, such as the United Kingdom. A Western Balkans FNC could also support accession of countries wishing to join NATO or the European Union, developing interoperability and standardization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;central-europe&quot;&gt;Central Europe&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine, especially the European response, has shifted Europe’s center of gravity east toward Europe’s Central and Eastern European (CEE) states, who, alongside the Baltic countries, have provided significant military, diplomatic, and humanitarian support to Ukraine. While the region already hosts political and defense cooperation, such as the Visegrad 4 and Central European Defence Cooperation (CEDC), this newfound confidence and influence could be harnessed and developed through an additional FNC. This FNC could be focused on long-term support for, and response to, the Ukraine war and more effectively burden sharing related tasks, such as coordinating humanitarian assistance, training Ukrainian forces on Western-supplied weapon systems, and refugee support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;establishing-new-thematic-fncs&quot;&gt;Establishing New Thematic FNCs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closely linked to the idea of regional FNCs is the development of frameworks with thematic specializations. Specialization is not a new concept within NATO or European security but has proved challenging given the tendency of states to avoid relying on others for wholesale capabilities or giving up elements of their own force. FNCs can offer a more flexible approach to specialization that can potentially alleviate political sensitivities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;centers-of-excellence&quot;&gt;Centers of Excellence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This form of FNC could build on activity already established by NATO-accredited Centers of Excellence (COEs), as well as European centers such as the Hybrid Threats Centre of Excellence Helsinki, which focus on conceptual development, developing best practice, and knowledge sharing and transfer. These FNCs would provide an additional operational and deployable capability to complement COE activity and would be able to enhance initiatives already underway. Moreover, thematic FNCs, overlayed with regional requirements, could unlock new opportunities for collaboration. Specialization and regional requirements can merge. For example, operating in the Arctic requires specialist capabilities and troops who are trained and conditioned to live and fight in extreme environments. For this purpose, it has been argued that NATO might benefit from establishing a dedicated Arctic Command. Here, framework nations could act as a precursor to developing more formalized and institutionalized structures within NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber&quot;&gt;Cyber&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber is a growth area for the alliance. The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence COE is a hub for cyber to support expertise and cooperation. While all nations will need cyber capabilities, the quality and reach of each nation varies considerably. For example, not all nations have offensive cyber capabilities, especially capabilities that can be effective against state-based threats, or the legal freedoms to use them. Therefore, an FNC formed around the provision of high-end capabilities, which could be led by the United States and United Kingdom given their advanced capabilities in this area, would significantly enhance offensive cyber and collective cyber defense for the alliance. The enhanced capabilities of leading allies could also be used to boost cyber resilience — supporting individual member states who are more at risk of cyberattack, surging specialist capabilities when required, or better managing the response to a significant cyberattack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;special-operations-forces&quot;&gt;Special Operations Forces&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special operations forces (SOF) are an area that NATO has heavily invested in during its time commanding the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, where SOF played an important role. NATO Special Operations Headquarters (NSHQ) Special Operations Component Command was declared fully operational at the 2014 Wales summit. Indeed, NSHQ is a pillar of the Connected Forces Initiative, which aims to ensure that allies and partners retain interoperability and collaboration levels from missions in Afghanistan, Libya, and the Balkans. Therefore, NSHQ ensures the benchmarking of SOF across the alliance. The role of framework nations in this area would be to further develop interoperability and integration across the whole range of SOF tasks, especially with conventional multinational formations. This activity is already underway through the Composite Special Operations Component Command between Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands and the Regional Special Operations Component Command between Croatia, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia, and Austria. These initiatives could be consolidated and developed into another FNC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;air-and-missile-defense&quot;&gt;Air and Missile Defense&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, NATO’s air and missile defense capabilities are critical for the defense and deterrence of Europe but are at risk of capability and capacity shortfalls to meet the threat from Russia. To address these challenges, a framework nation could be established to coordinate air and missile defense efforts to ensure the coherence of ongoing initiatives. Moreover, this FNC could focus on the integration, coverage, and layering of current air and missile defense capabilities to ensure they make the best use of current resources to support each NATO multinational battlegroup. In addition, this framework nation would naturally be best placed to develop future air and missile defense requirements for the alliance to inform the NATO Defense Planning Process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in developing existing and new FNCs, NATO should also manage the risks. While FNCs could be the answer to NATO’s prayers for a more efficient and effective collective defense and deterrence, if they result in “multispeed cooperation” or “coalitions of the willing” inside NATO then FNCs may undermine unity and cohesion at the level of 30 allies. In particular, the FNC led by Germany has grown in scope and membership to the extent it risks becoming a slightly smaller version of NATO-led capability development initiatives and formations, with concurrent risks of double-tapping or duplicating forces and projects. Ultimately, these issues are for the nations to solve through the mechanisms NATO provides, including its defense planning process. As one study puts it: “It is on the member states and allied institutions in Brussels to prevent or at least to moderate such developments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;framework-nations-still-indispensable&quot;&gt;Framework Nations: Still Indispensable&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s FNC is the latest of many alliance initiatives since 1949 to attempt to enhance collective defense through multinational cooperation. It reflects some of the basic principles set out in NATO’s first strategic concept, such as national specialization, mutual coordination, and regional planning. NATO has long navigated the creative tension between top-down orchestration and bottom-up specialization. This trend has continued since the last strategic concept in 2010 through Smart Defense and the FNC. Both initiatives have played their part in improving cooperation and coordination between allies in an era when European defense budgets have both fallen and risen in response to external shocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense spending in Europe is now rising rapidly in response to Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine. This does not mean that allies can relax their efforts to cooperate and coordinate their efforts. The scale and seriousness of Russia’s renewed threat to Europe, combined with the precarious global economic situation amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the fallout from Russia’s war of aggression, demands the same emphasis on economic efficiency and credible deterrence that faced NATO’s leaders and military planners in 1949. As today’s officials look beyond NATO’s Madrid summit to implement their new strategic concept, the FNC offers them an indispensable tool to achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to these well-established and purely defensive cyber volunteering efforts, the IT Army of Ukraine was stood up in an ad-hoc manner without a clearly structured and proven plan. Similarly, the absence of a Ukrainian military cyber command likely also pushed Kyiv to think creatively about how to combine its nascent military and intelligence cyber capabilities with a massive, willing, and global civilian IT community in the defense of the nation. Born out of necessity, the IT Army subsequently evolved into a hybrid construct that is neither civilian nor military, neither public nor private, neither local nor international, and neither lawful nor unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, the IT Army consists of two parts: (1) a continuous global call to action that mobilizes anyone willing to participate in coordinated DDoS attacks against designated – primarily civilian – Russian infrastructure targets; and (2) an in-house team likely consisting of Ukrainian defense and intelligence personnel that have been experimenting with and conducting evermore complex cyber operations against specific Russian targets. Both parts of the IT Army are purely offensive in nature and serve to bring willing amateurs (civilians) and dedicated professionals (civilian, military, intel) into one – most likely – hierarchically organizational structure. In addition, the IT Army has also given rise to an ecosystem that includes Ukrainian-owned IT companies and individuals located outside of Ukraine, as well as Ukrainians living in Ukraine working for Western companies. This ecosystem has been continuously creating new tools, generating knowhow, identifying new targets, and fulfilling other intelligence support functions to underpin Ukraine’s offensive efforts in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;who-needs-a-military-cyber-command-when-you-have-the-it-army&quot;&gt;Who needs a military cyber command when you have the IT Army?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IT Army’s structure and gravitational pull has created a myriad of new problem sets for the international community in areas such as the application of international law in cyberspace, the normative behavior of states, the targeting of civilian infrastructure, and the ethical conduct of IT companies headquartered outside Ukraine, to name a few. Many – if not all – of these problem sets have been largely ignored by the academic and information security community, as well as policymakers in both EU and NATO member states. It is unclear why this is the case, but it seems that the political and ideological support for the defense of Ukraine on the one hand, and growing anti-Russian sentiments on the other, have created an environment in which Ukrainian conduct in cyberspace is either willfully ignored, superficially analyzed, or significantly downplayed in terms of its impact and relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the DDoS side, the IT Army’s conduct shares a wide array of strategic overlaps with the DDoS campaign against Estonia in May 2007. The 2007 campaign was organized by Russian nationalistic hacktivists via Russian language fora / websites and lasted 22 days. To this day, no clear evidence of Russian government involvement has emerged, and as such the campaign was never officially attributed to the Russian state. As a result, Estonian and Western criticism pivoted to point out that Moscow had taken no meaningful measures to mitigate the DDoS campaign (a violation of its due diligence obligation), and the lack of cooperation with the Estonian investigation was highlighted as proof that the Russian government is shielding – and thereby implicitly supporting – those responsible for the DDoS campaign. Amidst this environment of helplessness, the speaker of the Estonian Parliament Ene Ergma even famously stated that, “when I look at a nuclear explosion, and the explosion that happened in our country in May, I see the same thing”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, in contrast to 2007, the IT Army’s DDoS conduct is pretty clear-cut when it comes to attribution, government authority, instructions, direction, and control. It is similarly clear-cut that the IT Army is persistently and indiscriminately targeting Russian civilian infrastructure, including online pharmacies, banks, food delivery services, and retailers. But while Russia has been rightfully vilified for the DDoS attacks in 2007, the IT Army and its Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Federov received two awards at the CYBERSEC European Cybersecurity Forum 2022 in Katowice, Poland, for their “heroic resistance to Russian aggression and protection of the digital borders of the democratic world”. As Federov put it, “this award is first and foremost for the entire cyber community and the volunteers who are now waging the world’s first cyberwar with us”. While there is certainly a difference between DDoS campaigns conducted in peacetime and during times of war, it seems that the West is now throwing overboard the legal and normative interpretations it has championed in cyberspace over the past decade for the sake of politically supporting Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the in-house side, the IT Army’s conduct has rapidly evolved from mere defacements of Russian websites during the first days of the invasion, to sophisticated espionage campaigns, to the first destructive offensive cyber operation – targeting a civilian video platform – in early May 2022. Currently, it is unclear what kind of cyber operations the in-house team side is going to focus on in the future. But, if the evolutionary trajectory over the past 4 months is any metric to go by, Russian defenders will highly likely face a variety of experimental cyber ops that will try to produce more and more severe impacts and longer lasting effects. Considering this trajectory, it is particularly curious to witness that a group of human rights lawyers recently decided to push the International Criminal Court in The Hague to open the first ever cyberwar crime case against Sandworm – a Russian military intelligence unit that successfully targeted electric utilities in Ukraine and caused short regional blackouts back in 2015-16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;research-methodology&quot;&gt;Research Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overarching aim of this report is to provide a comprehensive study that will serve as a baseline to understand, assess, and analyze the conduct of the IT Army and the ecosystem that feeds it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, this report was compiled by using only publicly accessible data. This includes public websites, Twitter posts, media articles, interviews, podcasts, Youtube videos, GoogleDoc forms, as well as hundreds of Telegram channels and chats. At no point during this research endeavor did the author participate in any of the malicious or illegal cyber activities mentioned in this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joining and reading hundreds of Telegram channels and chats was of particular importance for accessing and contextualizing the detailed information included in this report. For example, Telegram’s search function allows researchers to crawl through every channel they subscribe to and every chat they are a member of. This function was particularly helpful for tracking specific terms, targets, URLs, IPs, and port numbers across multiple Telegram channels and chat: The more channels and chats one has joined, the more visibility one has on the platform. The search function also chronologically displays the search hits which makes tracking information back to their likely origin a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note that joining a Telegram channel or chat does not constitute any formal membership, nor did it impose any obligations – financial, political, or otherwise – on the author.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joining a Telegram channel makes one a subscriber, thus, for example, enabling the option to set up new post alerts. One can also join a Telegram chat – which makes one a member of that chat – and enables the option to write in the chat. While most channels and chats can be viewed without joining, some channels and chats do prevent non-subscribers and non-members from seeing their content. A small number of subscriptions also require the confirmation of a channel administrator. Usually, these are granted within minutes and are only imposed to exercise a limited form of user admission control. In particular, Russian hacking groups are using this process to root out pro-Ukraine users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this research, the author did not post in any of the Telegram channels and chats. Nor did he engage in any private conversations with any Telegram users across the multitudes of channels and chats. The author did talk to several hacking groups on Twitter that have claimed to cooperate with the IT Army. Yet, none of these claims could be confirmed – and subsequently do not appear in this report – due to the IT Army’s unresponsiveness to the author’s email inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the report’s limitations, two items ought to be highlighted. First, the author did not have perfect visibility into all the relevant hacking communities on Telegram, as he was likely not a member of every pertinent Telegram channel and chat. It is thus unclear whether there were any other information flows occurring on Telegram that this report was unable to capture. Second, specific posts in Telegram chats are unlinkable by their very nature, and access to a good number of chats is usually granted through time-limited public invitations. As a result, this report is unable to provide functioning URLs to most of the chats and is unable to provide specific URLs to reference distinct Telegram chat posts. Wherever possible Telegram links are archived using “archive.ph” and non-Telegram links are archived via the Wayback Machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;genesis&quot;&gt;Genesis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of the IT Army of Ukraine (IT-армія україни) begins with Yegor Aushev. Aushev is a well-known Ukrainian IT entrepreneur and the co-founder of three companies that have become increasingly relevant amidst the eight year-long war with Russia – Cyber Unit Tech, Cyber School, and Hacken.io. Sometime between 24 February (the day of the Russian invasion) and 26 February, Aushev pitched the idea of a cyber volunteer army to Mykhailo Federov, Ukraine’s 31-year-young Minister of Digital Transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, Aushev also embarked on assembling a 1,000-men strong Ukrainian cybersecurity volunteer group at the request of a senior Ukrainian Defense Ministry official. Aushev facilitated the latter on Twitter and in various hacking fora by posting a Google Docs application form to gauge an applicant’s skill level and area of expertise. According to Aushev, this group of around 1,000 Ukrainian cybersecurity volunteers would be divided into an offensive and a defensive group. Talking to Reuters on 24 February, Aushev elaborated that the defensive group will be “employed to defend infrastructure such as power plants and water systems,” and the offensive group would help “Ukraine’s military conduct digital espionage operations against invading Russian forces”. As Aushev put it, “we have an army inside our country. … We need to know what they are doing”. As of this writing, the ratio between these two groups is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Aushev’s idea of an army of cyber-volunteers, Federov took to Facebook on 26 February at 9.00 a.m. CET and posted the following message in Ukrainian: “We have a lot of talented Ukrainians in the digital sphere: developers, cyberspecialists, designers, copywriters, marketers, targetologists, etc. We are creating an IT army. All operational tasks will be presented in the telegram channel: t.me/itarmyofurraine. There will be tasks for everyone”. Federov posted the same message in Ukrainian on his verified 170,000 subscriber strong Telegram channel. And at 7.38 p.m. CET his verified Twitter account tweeted in English that: “We are creating an IT army. We need digital talents. All operational tasks will be given here: t.me/itarmyofurraine”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western media coverage on the birth of the IT Army has almost exclusively focused on Federov’s Twitter post – because it was written in English – and ignored his Facebook and Telegram ones. But there are curious differences between these three posts. First, Federov’s target audience on Twitter was clearly international, while on Facebook and Telegram it was primarily aimed at Ukrainians. Second, in his Facebook and Telegram posts Federov was very precise about the exact talent the IT Army sought. And third, in all three messages Federov misspelled “ukraine” – but only his Telegram post was later corrected. Funnily enough, because of this mishap, there is only one post in the “itarmyofurraine” channel which redirects users to the official and correct “itarmyukraine2022” channel. Curiously, someone also decided to open up a Telegram channel on the same day, named “itarmyofuraine” (one “r,” missing “k”), which currently has around 11,500 subscribers and reposts some of the content from the official channel. Probably most crucial, western media outlets missed a post by the official Telegram channel of the Ministry of Digital Transformation on 26 February at 6.48 p.m. CET. Its content was almost identical to Federov’s recruitment message, except the Ministry added one crucial sentence: “we urge you to use any vector of cyber and DDoS attacks on Russian resources”. This call to arms echoed the first ever post in the official IT Army Telegram channel, which proclaimed two hours earlier: “Task # 1 We encourage you to use any vectors of cyber and DDoS attacks on these resources”. The post then listed 31 Russian banks, businesses, and government websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this writing it is unknown what exactly sparked the internal shift away from assembling developers, designers, and copywriters toward the IT Army’s almost sole focus on DDoS attacks. One likely explanation is that the specific Ukrainian talent that Federov outlined in his post was in the end funneled into a group called “StandForUkraine”. StandForUkraine was stood up by Roman Zakharov, a 37-year-old Ukrainian IT executive. The group currently consists of around 1,300 “software engineers, marketing managers, graphic designers and online ad buyers” that are fighting on Ukraine’s information warfare front. The group is trying to mobilize non-Ukrainians and the international community against the Russian invasion and is spreading Ukrainian war propaganda across Western media outlets and social media platforms. The group has also successfully pushed Western companies out of Russia. StandForUkraine has its own website, but in contrast to the IT Army, it is only using invite-only private chats on the messaging app Signal to communicate and organize. Future CSS research mights take a deep dive into the StandForUkraine ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the IT Army, it is important to stress that Federov is very active on Telegram but has only posted on Twitter 500 times or so since November 2020. Yet, even on Telegram, Federov rarely talks about the IT Army. Between 26 February and 20 April, he only forwarded 18 messages from the official IT Army channel. For a minister who created this digital army of volunteers, Federov seems rather disinterested in it. Instead, most of his Telegram posts gravitate toward his efforts to push Western companies out of Russia, fundraise for humanitarian projects and the Ukrainian armed forces, and inform citizens about the latest work of his Ministry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might assume the website of the Ministry of Digital Transformation would prominently display its connection to the IT Army and cover its ongoing activities in some way, shape, or form.18 And one would be wrong. As of this writing, there is not a single news item on the Ministry’s website that talks about the IT Army. Similarly, the Ministry’s official Telegram channel has mentioned the IT Army a mere ten times and forwarded just four posts from the official IT Army channel between 26 February and 20 April. Possibly spurred by the lack of consistent coverage, the Ministry’s Telegram channel announced on 18 April that moving forward, on every Monday it will talk about the victories of the IT Army. Notably, on 23 May, the Ministry summarized that “since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the IT army has attacked about 2,000 Russian resources”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curiously, the Ministry did mention the IT Army and its Telegram channel in two news items on kmu.gov.ua – the official web portal of the Ukrainian government – more than two weeks after Federov’s recruitment call. A news item on 10 March briefly acknowledged the existence of the IT Army, while the 12 March post prominently headlined, “the Ministry of Digital Transformation has created 3 services to fight the occupiers on the digital front”: The IT Army, the Internet Forces of Ukraine, and the e-Enemy app “еВорог”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uneven and rather bumpy IT Army coverage by the Ministry of Digital Transformation in the first two months after the invastion might be an outcome of the diffuse and still evolving organizational structure of the IT Army itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-many-members-does-the-it-army-have&quot;&gt;How many members does the IT Army have?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public reporting has put the number of IT Army members at around 300,000, which is derived from the number of subscribers to the official IT Army Telegram channel. According to TGStat, a platform that provides analytics for Telegram channels and chats, the IT Army’s Telegram channel reached its highest subscriber count on 26 March with 307,165.24 From thereon out, the numbers have continuously trended downward, leading to a cumulative loss of 47,940 subscribers over the following eight weeks (15.6%). On 10 June, the IT Army subscriber count stood at 259,225.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is unknown why exactly the channel has been losing so many followers so quickly, the likeliest explanation is probably a combination of (1) the loss of novelty over time, (2) boredom due to repetitive tasking, and (3) the ongoing kinetic war itself, which remains largely unaffected by the IT Army’s DDoS activities due to the focus on targeting Russian civilian infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To contextualize the IT Army’s subscriber number it is useful to know that Telegram offers two platform types: (a) channels in which only the channel administrator’s messages appear, and users can comment if that function is enbled. And (b) chats where users can actually have somewhat of a dialogue with multiple members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the IT Army’s Telegram channel – which is literally open to anyone – there is little to no in-depth operational discussion taking place. The IT Army also has an official Telegram chat, yet its number stands at a mere 3,200 members. Discussion in the chat primarily gravitates toward helping other members solve their technical problems, and occasionally highlighting new potential Russian targets that are worth DDoSing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how many members does the IT Army really have? Nobody actually knows, not even the IT Army itself. What the IT Army does know – or more precisely put – what the IT Army’s coordination team and Telegram channel administrators know, is the exact number of people that have directly approached them to offer their skills and time via the IT Army’s Gmail account and Google Docs contact forms. As of this writing, that number has not been publicly disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;targeting-flow-and-coordination&quot;&gt;Targeting Flow and Coordination&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we do know is that the IT Army’s Telegram channel is just one component within the IT Army’s organizational structure – essentially serving as a sort of megaphone to circulate DDoS targeting information. In an interview with Ukrainian outlet Media Sapiens in late March, Mstislav Banik, the Head of the Electronic Services Development at the Ministry of Digital Transformation explained that “all tasks are formed by channel curators, who distribute them in the channel for volunteers. Anyone can subscribe to the project’s telegram channel and receive assignments”. With the aid of a few practical examples the following paragraphs will explain how the visible part of this targeting flow works in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;simple-tasking&quot;&gt;Simple Tasking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first example is on “simple tasking”. Here, the exact same targeting information the IT Army channel publishes is circulated in numerous other channels and chats. On 18 March at 3.50 p.m. CET, the IT Army channel posted the URL of vesti95.ru, one of vesti95’s IPs, and four ports. Vesti95 is the official newspaper published by the Ministry of the Chechen Republic for National Policy, External Relations, Press and Information. A mere three minutes later the same information appeared in a chat named “DDoS Joint Group” (around 1,900 members). 20 minutes after that, it was published in the “Hacker Forces” channel (around 1,100 subscribers), which is the official channel of Hacken.io’s volunteer cyber army. Hacker Forces kindly credited the source of the information by explaining that, “here is a new task from itarmyofukraine2022. Are you in?” At 5.39 p.m., a channel called “Studentcyberarmy” (around 900 subscribers) posted the exact same information with no credit to the IT Army, and literally within the same minute that information was forwarded in the “CyberFire” chat (around 5,500 members). At 7.00 p.m., a channel belonging to “Cyber Palyanitsa” (around 700 subscribers) posted the same targeting details with no credit given. And at 7.59 p.m. CET, the information popped up on the “disBalancer Ukraine” channel (around 5,500 members), which is the Ukrainian channel of Hacken.io’s disBalancer DDoS tool. On 20 March at 4.16 p.m. CET, the “disBalancer English” channel (around 13,500 members) posted the url of vesti.ru under the header of “Websites [that] were under attack on 18 March 2022”. One hour later that post was forwarded in the Hacker Forces channel. As this example shows, Hacken.io is deeply entrenched in the information flow coming out of the IT Army channel. This should not come as a surprise, given that Aushev was the co-founder of Hacken.io. But the relationship between the IT Army and Hacken.io runs much deeper than that – more on this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;target-enrichment&quot;&gt;Target Enrichment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second example is on what is best described as “target enrichment.” Here, the targeting information posted by the IT Army channel is only circulated when it is further enriched with more IPs and ports. On 14 March at 9.11 a.m. CET, the IT Army channel posted the url of asna.ru and one of its IPs. Asna represents a network of more than 10,000 pharmacies in Russia and its website functions as a nationwide online pharmacy. The IT Army’s targeting information was only re-published in the DDoS Joint Group chat and a channel called “KiberBull” (around 7,800 subscribers), but no other channel or chat visible to me. That calculus changed eight days later when on 22 March at 10.38 a.m. CET, the Studentcyberarmy announced, “Good morning, today we start our day on the cyber front with a store in the pharmaceutical industry, namely ASNA! We are attacking until 13:00!” Included in the post was the IP mentioned by the IT Army, two additional target IPs, and six ports – two for each of the three IPs. One minute later that post was forwarded to the CyberFire chat and the “DDoS Attack Cyber Cossacks” chat (around 25,800 members). At 10.51 a.m. CET the “Cyber Cerber” chat (around 600 members) posted the exact same targeting information with no credit given, and at 11.35 a.m. the “DDoS Attack Cyber Cossacks” channel (around 69,800 subscribers) tasked its DDoS teams one and four to hit the three Asna IPs. Each Cyber Cossacks DDoS team has about 1,000 dedicated members who are highly active and coordinate their activities in their own separate chats. On the next day at 12.08 p.m. CET, Cyber Palyanitsa posted the same targeting information again. Nine minutes later it appeared in the Cyber Cerber chat, and eight minutes after that it was reposted in a channel called “Anonymous-Ukraine” (around 1,900 subscribers). At exactly 12.29 p.m. CET, the Studentcyberarmy made a new post with the same Asna targeting information, which was immediately forwarded in the CyberFire chat. Seven minutes later, the DDoS Attack Cyber Cossacks channel posted the commands to pull the latest docker image to update the target information for asna.ru. Notably absent in the entire information exchange was Hacken.io.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;external-clustering&quot;&gt;External Clustering&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third example is “external clustering”, which is when the targeting information fails to circulate widely and only survives in a small cluster of channels and chats. On 28 February and 3 March, the URL of mvideo.ru was mentioned in the disBalancer Ukraine chat and the CyberFire chat. Mvideo is one the largest consumer electronics chains in Russia. The call to target mvideo was not picked up by anyone until two weeks later when Cyber Palyanitsa posted 3 of mvideo’s IPs and 18 different ports at 9.19 p.m. CET. Eleven minutes later the Studentcyberarmy posted the exact same targeting information, and literally within the same minute the post was forwarded in the CyberFire chat. At 10.21 p.m., Cyber Cerber picked up the information as well. On 7 May, the IT Army finally picked up mvideo as a DDoS target with one IP overlapping from the previously shared target information. A group known as Ukrainian Reaper posted the commands to update Multiddos via docker and MHDDoS via Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; Multiddos is a DDoS script that is exclusively being used by Ukrainian Reaper. It combines three tools: auto_mhddos developed by Ukrainian Reaper, db1000n, and UA Cyber Shield. The latter two will be discussed in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ad-hoc-prioritization&quot;&gt;Ad Hoc Prioritization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth example is on what might be adequately termed “ad hoc prioritization”. Here, bits and pieces of targeting information pop up now and then in various channels and chats but are only consolidated at a much later point in time when the target is designated high priority by the IT Army. Between February 28 and March 4, the targeting of qiwi.com was widely discussed in the IT Army chat, the CyberFire chat, and the two disBalancer chats. QIWI is a popular Russia payment service provider that also serves the other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Multiple users on Telegram asked why QIWI was not being announced as a DDoS target. One user for example quipped that QIWI should not be targeted because there needs to be at least one path to send money from Russia to Ukraine. Others were simply stating that they were now DDoSing QIWI individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dynamics changed on 4 March, when QIWI released a press statement noting that “U.S. and EU sanctions targeting Russia have had no immediate material impact on QIWI’s operations. Neither QIWI nor any of its subsidiaries is specifically targeted by the new sanctions enacted as a result of the Russian military operations in Ukraine”. On the same day, the “DDoS Attack Cyber Cossacks” channel (around 69,800 subscribers) announced the targeting of QIWI and published one IP and two ports. A few hours later the target was changed to a different QIWI IP in a post explaining, “let’s try with more people, start 9:23, attack to the point until I give a new goal”. The discussion on targeting QIWI kept on going for the next 25 days, with different channels and chats publishing other QIWI IPs and running their own DDOS attacks. Then on 29 March, the IT Army channel surprisingly announced that “we have a need to attack QIWI now”. The post covered 15 QIWI IPs and ports, including all those that were previously circulated in different channels and chats. For whatever reason, on that very day, the IT Army decided to designate QIWI a high priority DDoS target that needed to be taken down immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, ad hoc prioritization was also at play when EGAIS was targeted by the IT Army in early May 2022. EGAIS is the Russian government’s unified state automated alcohol accounting information system, which is the centralized systems that certifies and taxes every bottle of alcohol, vodka, and wine produced in Russia. Back in early April 2022, one user in the IT Army’s chat brought up EGAIS three times as being a good DDoS target. As the user himself explained on 4 April, “believe me, this goal is quite serious because it causes reputational damage. This portal belongs to the state and shops and distributors must confirm exactly according to the law of the Russian Federation to wait for documents in this portal”. On 2 May at 8.00 a.m., EGAIS was picked up as a target by the DDoS Attack Cyber Cossacks. And at 8.55 a.m. the IT Army channel announced that “today’s target was received from one of our subscribers. EGAIS is a Russian federal state-owned automatic system for tracking the production and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the country. If this system is down, the official turnover of liquor and spirits in Russia will be blocked!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Russian media outlet Vedomosti, “producers and distributors of alcohol for the first May holidays could not ship products to their customers due to a large-scale failure in the operation of [EGAIS].” Between 2 May and 12 May, the IT Army designated EGAIS a high priority target. On 7 May for example, the IT Army channel noted that “today, online shopping Russia will be cancelled ;) And don’t forget to keep ‘EGAIS’”. Similarly on 8 May, the channel explained, “we have a tradition to combat Russian propaganda on Sunday. Let’s stick to it. Additionally, we’d like to keep a firm grip on ‘EGAIS’ because due to your help, there is an ongoing flow of complaints about this service”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, “as of May 2022, over 65,000 ‘sofa hackers’ from the USA, Turkey, Georgia, and EU countries regularly took part in coordinated DDoS attacks on [Russia’s] critical information infrastructure”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;it-army-coordination-document&quot;&gt;IT Army Coordination Document&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a sense of how the visible sharing of DDoS targeting information works on Telegram, let us take a look at the publicly accessible IT Army coordination document which is hosted on Google Docs and shared by the official IT Army Telegram bot. For this write-up the most recent version was accessed on 30 March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coordination document is sporadically being updated by the IT Army and includes information on the priorities of DDoS targets. It also roughly tracks which websites are down or need to be re-engaged, and it serves as a resource to several DDoS tooling instructions as a guide for newcomers. On the DDoS target prioritization part, the document shows that the IT Army only had two priority designations at the time. Russian online banking services like Sberbank and payment processors such as Mirconnect were designated priority tier one. Online tellers like cse.ru were deemed priority tier two. Notably, as of this writing, QIWI was still absent from the priority list, yet it did appear under a separate tab called “find_ip_port”, with no IP and ports yet scribbled in, illustrating the ad hoc nature of the IT Army targeting QIWI. Interestingly, the document also had a tab called “IP&amp;amp;Port”, which on 30 March only included the URLs, IPs, and ports of six Russian Ministries. Those targets were published by the IT Army channel on 30 March at 1.48 p.m. CET. Apart from these six targets there are no other IPs and ports listed in the entire coordination document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the IT Army has been primarily utilizing the coordination document as an introductory guide to newcomers which is why it included two DDoS attack level categories: “attack: simple level” and “attack: advanced level”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple level lists four DDoS sites. Users load these websites in their browser, then a script on the website continuously sends requests to a pre-set list of designated targets. Some DDoS websites display which sites they are targeting while others do not. Probably the most popular DDoS attack website listed in the IT Army’s coordination document is playforukraine.org. The website was developed by members of the Lviv IT cluster and gamifies DDoS attacks by engaging users with the popular numerical puzzle game 2048. Playforukraine stands apart from other DDoS websites for four reasons: (a) it was launched on 28 February, only four days after the Russian invasion started;(b) it claims to be verified by the Ukrainian Cyberpolice; (c) it was promoted on the official Lviv Regional Administration website; and (d) it has been officially endorsed by the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation and even the Ukrainian Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking to FastCompany, the developers explained that “one user can send 20,000 server requests in one hour of gameplay”. On 3 March, playforukraine tweeted that “123k players performed 153 bln attacks”. Playforukraine does not reveal which sites it is targeting, but the occasional screenshot posted on their Twitter account shows web check results for dominopizza.ru, alfabank.ru, and gazprom.ru. As with all other attack vectors, playforukraine notes on its website that “before starting the game, turn on the [Virtual Private Network] if you play from the territory of Ukraine”. This essentially means that users using VPNs route their traffic through a server located outside Ukraine – most notably EU and NATO member states – to DDoS Russian sites. The reasons for doing this are manifold, with the primary one being that Russia companies have blacklisted Ukrainian IPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the advanced level DDoS attacks, the IT Army’s coordination document is rather outdated, as it includes step-by-step manuals that were drawn up back in late February. These include instructions such as utilizing free trial periods for virtual servers in the cloud – offered by AWS, Google, and Microsoft – to install DDoS attack tools. Other instructions cover a handful of GitHub repositories to set up dockers and “stress testers/DDoS testing tools”, including GoldenEye and Slowloris which are pretty old school. GoldenEye’s initial releases was back in 2012 and Slowloris three years before that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A site called ddosukraine.com.ua has communicated a clearer understanding of what the IT Army means by advanced level attacks. Initially it was unknown who set-up the site, but in March the official IT Army channel bot started to recommend the site every 15 minutes in the IT Army Telegram chat. The website also linked exclusively to the IT Army channel and refresheed every 15 minutes to show the latest targeting information published by the IT Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the section on “powerful tools”, one set of instructions details how to set up a virtual machine to run “Death by 1000 needles” (db1000n). Db1000n is a GitHub repository authored by Arriven aka. Bohdan Ivashko, a senior software engineer working out of Kyiv for Palo Alto-headquartered US-headquartered computer network security company Cyberhaven. Db1000n is special to the degree that (a) it was uploaded onto GitHub on 26 February in direct response to the Russian invasion, (b) its official manual notes that “this is an instruction manual for those who want to provide their computers to the centralized management of the Ukrainian IT Army”, (c) it is mentioned more than 680 times in the IT Army chat, and (d) it serves as a foundation for several git clones that are IT Army inspired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the instructions for db1000n on the ddosukraine.com site linked to a Google Drive folder with a docx file that read: “My name is Igor, I’m an IT specialist from Lviv. At first, I came across a channel in the Telegram ‘IT Army of Ukraine’. There I learned that there is a ready-made program ‘Death by 1000 needles’, created to bring down the sites of Mordor, as well as that it needs to run via VPN. Working for a week, I assembled a virtual shell machine for Death by 1000 needles. My shell turned out to be quite successful, so I decided to share it with others”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early April, the ddosukraine.com.ua site moved to the new domain itarmy.com.ua. The official IT Army bot has been promoting the site ever since, and the IT Army channel has endorsed it as the official IT Army of Ukraine website. Probably the most intriguing change that was introduced on the new site was an announcement on 5 April that stated “very important! For an effective attack, we must all strike at the same targets and keep them in that position for as long as necessary. Therefore, we ask you not to join in the chats and not to launch independent attacks on other targets”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;github-repositories&quot;&gt;GitHub Repositories&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, the number one GitHub repository discussed in the IT Army chat – with around 1070 mentions – is called MHDDoS. MHDDoS is not in any way affiliated with the IT Army and its author explicitly notes in the repository’s readme, “Please Don’t Attack websites without the owner’s consent”. The most shared MHDDoS clone in the IT Army chat is called MHDDoS_proxy authored by a user named porthole-ascend-cinnamon. In the GitHub repository readme file, porthole-ascend-cinnamon links to an unofficially guide called “DDoS-for-all”, authored by a user named SlavaUkraineSince1991. It did not come as a surprise that the examples SlavaUkraineSince1991 used in his guide were ria.ru and tass.ru. What did come as a surprise was that the guide linked to three different Telegram channels with none of them being the IT Army: “DDOS Tutorial for all” (around 5,800 subscribers), “KiberBull” (around 7,700 subscribers), and “Ukrainian Reaper” (around 4,800 subscribers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the three channels in question, a few things stick out. All three occasionally pick up targets that are announced by the IT Army channel. KiberBull for example, was the only channel visible to me that re-posted the target information for asna.ru on 14 March. By contrast, Ukrainian Reaper officially stated on 1 March that they are sourcing their targets from the IT Army channel and a Telegram channel called “ddoskotyky” (around 20,100 subscribers). In some instances, DDOS Tutorial for all and Kiberbull decided to help the IT Army finish off their targets, as was the case on 19 March when the IT Army announced the targeting of tutu.ru, Russia’s largest rail and flight ticket booking service. DDOS Tutorial for all explained that “we help IT Army of Ukraine to finish tutu.ru”, and KiberBull equally posted that “we will help IT-Army to put [out] one of the largest ticket booking services [tuttu.ru]”. Overall, however, these three channels do not seem to act as one coherent group, except for one oddity: DDOS Tutorial for all does occasionally support KiberBull and Ukrainian Reaper in their individual DDoS campaigns that are not IT Army designated targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should these three groups be considered part of the IT Army? Yes and no. On the one hand, they do occasionally participate in the IT Army’s DDoS campaigns. On the other hand, the IT Army itself explained in a Telegram post on 4 April: “there are quite a few channels that conduct DDoS attacks on hostile services with us. Each community has a database of tutorials, as well as a sufficient number of involved participants. It is important to understand that each community is independent and chooses priority goals for itself. But we all communicate with each other and quite often they support us in attacks on our targets. We want to thank our subscribers and the following communities for their active position and help in the fight against the enemy in cyberspace”. Among the communities listed are Ukrainian Reaper and KiberBull, but also Cyber Palyanitsa, Studentcybergroup, DDoS Attack Cyber Cossacks, Anonymous-Ukraine, DDoS joint group, and UA Cyber Shield – which we are going to look at next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidenote: Cyber Palyanitsa echoes the IT Army’s sentiment. On its website it lists several coordinating groups stating “Choose your legion. Each of our groups has both common and individual tasks, join and help Ukraine with us!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third GitHub repository that has been popping-up in various Telegram channels is called UA Cyber Shield or uashield for short. Uashield is a DDoS tool that was uploaded onto GitHub on 28 February. It is a project by a group that calls itself the “Volunteer cyber defense of Ukraine”. Uashield stands out because of four oddities: (a) on the group’s website – help-ukraine-win.super.site – they display an official Ukrainian government logo with the note, “supported by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine”; (b) in its GitHub readme they explain that “ALERT!!! We are not supporting unlawful active attacks or malware campaigns that are causing technical harms. Use only for educational purposes. You can only try this platform on your own website!”; (c) they are the only DDoS tool I am aware of whose instructions have been translated into 11 different languages, including Korean and Portuguese; and (d) on 31 March, the official uashield Telegram channel stated that “starting from the current version UA Cyber SHIELD supports all attack types used by the IT Army of Ukraine: HTTP / HTTPS / UDP”. Four days later, uashield officially announced that “we are working together with the IT ARMY of Ukraine”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, with uashield running on almost all operating systems – including mobile OS – combined with its prominent attack counter user interface, it has almost naturally attracted the attention of many young non-technical users who in turn have posted several videos of their own uashield use on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth GitHub repo is called disBalancer. DisBalancer was designed by a team of cybersecurity and cryptocurrency enthusiasts and was launched under the umbrella of the Hacken Foundation on 2 March 2021. It markets itself as a web3 decentralized DDoS protection network. Essentially, users anywhere can install disBalancer and become members (or farmers as they are called) in a de-centralized network by renting out unused bandwidth and storage space. In return they are rewarded with DDoS tokens that can be bought and sold on most cryptocurrency exchange platforms. As disBalancer explains it: “It works similarly to a blockchain mining pool by setting up a computer node to perform the required operations and receive traffic”. Businesses that are interested in implementing disBalancer as a DDoS protection solution simply have to add their network nodes to the DNS records and “all traffic starts circulating behind the nearest ones available. Each node can then redirect traffic to others nearby to increase capacity as required”. At its core, disBalancer was inherently conceptualized as a defensive tool to offload incoming DDoS traffic. As the team itself explains, “we strive to defend companies with servers and services on the Internet against DDoS attacks. Our network will act as a warrantor, sharing unused computer power and bandwidth with companies that need these resources. Thereby we will make the world a safer place and change the meaning of DDoS to the good side”. So far so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hacken-liberator-and-hackenproof&quot;&gt;Hacken, Liberator, and Hackenproof&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem for Estonia-headquartered Hacken.io started on 4 March when the disBalancer team launched a DDoS attack tool called the Liberator. Liberator was developed in reaction to the Russian invasion with the overarching goal of “helping liberate Ukraine” by DDoSing “Russian propaganda websites and sources that contribute to the Russian invasion of Ukraine”. The disbalancer team essentially switched from DDoS defense to DDoS offense by explaining, “don’t ask us how legal DDoS attacks on Russian propaganda sites are. Our cities are bombarded where children and civilians die. We are acting in coordination with the Ministry of Digital Transformation that initiated the Ukrainian Cyber Army invention [IT Army] to help the Armed Forces of Ukraine”. By tapping into the community disBalancer had built over the past year, users across the globe who previously ran the disBalancer DDoS protection tool now heeded the call and installed Liberator for offensive purposes. For good measure, disBalancer also reminded their followers that, “if you think that this does not concern you or disagree with our participation in fighting against Russian aggression, just leave us forever. Indifference is no less a crime when it comes to other people’s lives”. As of this writing, disBalancer claims that Liberator was downloaded 100,000+ times, and between 3,000-6,000 users are running the application at any given point in time. If this were not enough to convince people to participate, the disBalancer website notes that (a) “we guarantee [the] safety of your computer and data. It’s legal and white methods” and that (b) “by buying DDOS tokens, anybody can help us to scale the app infrastructure and purchase more servers”. This means that the DDoS tokens that users could farm by being part of disBalancer’s de-centralized DDoS protection network are now being used as a financial resource to build out Liberator’s DDoS attack infrastructure. If by this point users were still unsure whether installing Liberator was a good idea, the disBalancer website reassured them under the Ukrainian coat of arms that “we’re acting in coordination with the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how tightly is disBalancer interwoven with Hacken and the Ministry of Digital Transformation? Well, the disBalancer team leaders are prominently displayed on their website. They include Serhii Dovhopolyi, who works as tech lead and is also on Hacken’s Kyiv-based R&amp;amp;D team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oleksandr Horlan is operations lead, and he also works for Hacken in Kyiv as a penetration tester and security analyst. Dyma Budorin serves as advisor and is also the Cofounder and CEO of Hacken. Finally, Denis Ivanov is an advisor and also the Head of the Expert Group at the Ministry of Digital Transformation. The disBalancer website’s privacy notice similarly explains that “we are Hacken OÜ, located at Kai tn 1-5M, Tallinn city, Harju county, 10111, Estonia”. This is the physical address of Hacken’s headquarter in Estonia, a NATO and EU member state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, on 10 March, Politico reported that some 50 employees of Hacken’s Kyiv office were relocated to Spain, another NATO/EU member state, for security reasons. Eighteen days later, the IT Army channel officially promoted disBalancer’s Liberator to its then-306,000 subscribers for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 20 April, disBalancer went on to publish its first recruitment video on Youtube. The video’s message stated: “instruction is clear even for a little baby. The most effective DDoS-App against Russian Aggressor. … Run attacks 24/7 wherever you are. We are the Cyber Army. Join Ukrainian Cyber Army in the first cyber world war. You can become a legend”. Eight days later, a US-based Youtube cryptocurrency influencer by the name of Boxmining published an 8-minute-long video urging his 268,000 subscribers to install Liberator to DDoS Russian sites. Boxmining is not just a random Youtube influencer. He visited Hacken’s Kyiv office in 2020, and in 2021 he interviewed Hacken’s CEO Dyma Burodin on his Youtube channel. Naturally, the video was warmly embraced by disBalancer and the Hacken Forces Telegram channel, as well as on Hacken’s Twitter account, which tweeted “how to defend Ukraine with ONE app? Run @thedisbalancer’s Liberator! @boxmining, a famous crypto influencer and Hacken’s friend, dropped a new video on his Youtube channel with an easy explanation”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither Hacken nor Boxmining informed their (mostly young) userbase about the potential legal consequences and blowback from running DDoS and interfering in an international armed conflict. In the US, DDoS attacks may be considered a federal crime under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. And in Estonia – where Hacken’s headquarter is physically located – DDoS attacks may fulfill the category of computer sabotage, which is punishable by up to 3 years in prison. Notably, back in early April 2022, Russia’s FSB detained a system administrator working for a local company in Yalta, Crimea, who installed a DDoS tool on his work computer to run attacks against Russian websites between 24 February and 10 March. He is currently facing five years in prison. It is unknown which exact DDoS tool he used. What we do know is that in mid-May, The Wall Street Journal reported that disBalancer/Hacken’s Kyiv team moved from Barcelona, Spain, to Lisbon, Portugal, another NATO and EU member state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underlining this nonchalance, disBalancer decided to publish three Liberator user interviews on 27 May 2022. It is unknown whether these interviews were conducted with real users or are fictional creations the disBalancer team invented to advertise the use of Liberator. Jase Mo from the US explained that “I started off on the hackenproof.com page and went from there. I found Liberator to be, ‘EASY AF’ to use. … Not only has Liberator made it easy AF to join the fight, but has allowed the average person to be a part of the Team that is pulling off the largest most effective DDoS champagne the world has ever seen. I love this shit”. Meanwhile, Casimir from Germany stressed the financial side of things: “what would motivate me even more? Maybe a special kind of disBalancer NFT for the verified users of Liberator. ;) I saw that there might be DDOS NFTs for those who hold more than 1000 DDOS [tokens] until the war is over (which is easy for me because I’m buying more as soon as I can)… But maybe you could make special edition NFTs for the cyber warriors?” And Daniil from Ukraine stressed what else can be done: “Besides being involved in disBalancer, I actively support Ukraine in other ways. For instance, by donating to the Armed Forces of Ukraine and assisting the cyber fight on the side of Ukrainians with other DDoS tools designed to shoot russians down. I use a few other applications like UA Cyber SHIELD, dn1000n, dripper, MHDDos, and 5 sites for DDoS attacks. Besides, I report on russian propaganda telegram groups in order to hinder the lies that spread among the people, including in the occupied territories”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 8 June 2022, disBalancer announced that Roskomnadzor – Russia’s Federal Service for the Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media – blocked access to disbalancer.com. According to the disBalancer blog the “access restrictions to our site to Russian providers and Internet users from russia will not stop our DDoS attacks on russian propaganda websites, government, and infrastructure systems that provide the basis for everyday life and enable the flow of goods, information, and services. Until russia withdraws the last soldier from Ukraine and the ongoing shelling by Russian forces stops, we are going to further enhance our activities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cooperation between Hacken and the Ukrainian government does not stop there. HackenProof, which is Hacken’s bug bounty platform, has been running two vulnerability reporting programs in response to the ongoing war in Ukraine: a defensive and an offensive one. The defensive program was established around 1 March and runs under the name “Call for Ukrainian cyber defense. Stop the war”. It is geared toward finding “critical vulnerabilities” in Ukrainian government and infrastructure websites, which HackenProof then reports to the corresponding authorities. As the site explains, “we’re looking for vulnerabilities such as RCE, SQLI, RFI/LFI, or data leaks. Please don’t waste time on low-/medium-severity vulnerabilities. Save our time for what matters”. As of 25 May the program received 291 submissions by 27 authors. According to the Wayback Machine, on 8 March the number stood at 271 submissions by 23 authors. Thus, over the past 2.5 months the program added a mere 20 new submissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the program does not pay any bounties, it is important to understand that for a long-time ethical hackers “could face fines of up to $42,000 USD or even three years in prison for trying to detect bugs in the computer systems of the Ukrainian parliament, ministries, or state companies”. Only on 21 April, roughly seven weeks after HackenProof initiated its defensive bug bounty program, did the Ukrainian Parliament adopt the law on “Amendments to the Criminal Code of Ukraine to Increase the Effectiveness of the Fight against Cybercrime in the Conditions of Martial Law”, which tweaked the criminal code to enable bug bounty programs for the public sector. As of this writing it is still unclear whether HackenProof’s bug bounty program ever ran afoul of Ukrainian law or whether Hacken’s physical location in Estonia shielded it from prosecution. It is also unknown whether the program was supported by members in the Ukrainian government, or how exactly HackenProof streamlined its information flow to contact the multitude of Ukrainian authorities and companies affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HackenProof’s offensive program was started on 27 February and runs under the name “Call for exploits. Stop the war”. Similar to the defensive one, HackenProof is only looking for submissions of critical vulnerabilities, including data leaks, which are then “put in the good hands of Ukrainian cyber forces”. The focus areas are Russian hosting providers, ISPs, aerospace/air control, SCADA systems, banks, public services, energy/oil/gas, transportation/logistics, ports/elevators, and even retail. It is unclear whether submissions pertaining to the Russian healthcare sector, humanitarian NGOs, schools and universities are also being accepted by HackenProof. Notably, the program site directly links to the IT Army’s Telegram channel explaining, “for reference, you can use Resources shared by Ukrainian cyber volunteers”. As of 25 May, the program had 422 submissions by 32 authors. According to the Wayback Machine that number has stayed the same since 14 March. Thus, over the past eleven weeks the offensive program received no new submissions. Like the defensive program, there are no bounty pay-outs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the existence of the offensive bug bounty program combined with the fact that it is organized by a company headquartered in Estonia has to date not spurred any legal, ethical, nor political conversations on co-belligerency in cyberspace, the role of Ukrainian-owned companies operating from NATO/EU member states, and their targeting of Russian civilian infrastructure in cooperation with the Ukrainian government. There is also no conversation in the information security community on the role of bug bounty programs targeting a belligerent party embroiled in an international conflict. The current silence on these issues amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine is certainly understandable – and so is the activism of Ukrainians abroad – yet NATO/EU member states might be setting unintended legal and ethical precedents that may create significant political blowback in the future. For example, what if a Russian-owned company located in Germany were to organize an offensive bug bounty program that targets Ukrainian critical infrastructure and shares the discovered vulnerabilities with the Russian intelligence community? Would Berlin, Brussels, and Washington deem this acceptable private sector behavior?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from HackenProof’s two bug bounty programs, Yegor Aushev also started his own bug bounty program called “Hack/Fuck Russia” that ran its first phase from 1 March to 10 March. It was financially supported by Aushev’s Kyiv-based Cyber Unit Tech company with a donation of 100,000 USD. Curiously, the bug bounty announcement also included a Tether wallet address for donations. To date that wallet has received a combined 70 Tether, which is a mere 70 USD (Tether is pegged 1:1 to USD). Yet, in an interview with The Record, a Cyber Unit Tech representative explained that “our company has contributed the initial $100,000, but we see participation and contribution from all over the world. The amounts are very, very significant and might be one of the biggest bounties ever, maybe the biggest ‘unofficial’ bounty”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do we square these two different assessments? If there is a huge donation flow that underpins Aushev’s bug bounty program, then it is certainly not going into the Tether wallet. We also know that neither Aushev nor Cyber Unit Tech have posted any other wallet addresses on their official Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook accounts. So, how do people from across the world know to which wallets to donate in support of the cause? One feasible explanation could be that the wallet addresses are spread within invite-only groups on WhatsApp and Signal to facilitate donations from the Ukrainian IT community living abroad. Another possibility might be that the international cryptocurrency donations flowing into the Ukrainian government’s official Bitcoin, Thether, and Etherium wallets are partially underpinning Aushev’s bug bounty program. As of 21 April, neither Aushev nor Cyber Unit Tech has announced the start of phase two of their bug bounty program. It is unknown whether the program actually paid out any bounties or to whom any of the reported vulnerabilities were forwarded. Given Aushev’s closeness to the Ukrainian government and Cyber Unit Tech’s strategic partners – which includes the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine – we can infer with some level of confidence that the vulnerabilities might have ended up in the hands of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, the intelligence services, or the IT Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;non-public-structure-and-tasks&quot;&gt;Non-public Structure and Tasks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the publicly visible IT Army structures and tasking flows, there also exists an in-house section to the IT Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hints of the in-house section first popped up in early March when the IT Army defaced miranda-media.ru, which is a Russian ISP serving the Crimean Peninsula. Several other defacements followed of which almost none gained widespread media attention. The exception occurred on 2 April and 6 April, when the websites of Sukhoi.ru and Gazprom.ru were defaced with fake statements by Yuri Slyusar (General Director of Sukhoi) and Alexie Miller (CEO of Gazprom) criticizing the Kremlin for the war in Ukraine. At the time, public speculations veered between the websites being hacked by an unknown group and the statements being legitimate. The fog of war was lifted three weeks later on 23 April, when the IT Army’s channel posted a three-minute video in which it took credit for the fake statements. As the video explains, “we published the statement, but all [the content was] taken from Mr. Slyusar’s correspondence with colleagues and friends. … Within the Kremlin’s inner circle people know about [Alexie Miller’s] position for a long time. We just made it public, completely collecting his thoughts from the correspondence”. As of this writing, discussions pertaining to defacements are entirely absent from both the IT Army channel and chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 4 April, the IT Army posted a two-minute video on the use of Clearview in Ukraine to identify Russian soldiers. Clearview is a controversial US-headquartered AI facial recognition company that has assembled a vast biometric database – by scraping facial pictures from social media and the wider Internet – to readily identify and locate any individual. The company is currently facing several lawsuits in the US and has been fined by various privacy watchdogs in the EU. On 23 May, the UK’s Information Commisioner’s Office fined Clearview more than 7.5 million GBP and ordered the company to delete all the data of UK residents from its systems. Kashmir Hill at The New York Times explained Clearview’s impact best by stating that, “searching someone by face could become as easy as Googling a name. Strangers would be able to listen in on sensitive conversations, take photos of the participants and know personal secrets. Someone walking down the street would be immediately identifiable – and his or her home address would be only a few clicks away. It would herald the end of public anonymity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 13 March, Reuters reported that the Ukrainian Defense Ministry started to use Clearview to identify dead Russian soldiers. Ten days later, Ukraine’s Minister of Digital Transformation, Mykhailo Federov, explained on Telegram that “today, we use artificial intelligence to search the social media accounts of dead Russian soldiers for photos of corpses, to report their deaths to friends and relatives, to dispel the myth of a ‘special operation’ in which ‘no conscripts’ and ‘no one dies.’” Exact figures on Clearview’s use in Ukraine were hard to come by until the IT Army posted its video on 4 April. In it, the IT Army explained that it uses Clearview to directly contact dead soldiers’ families and loved ones via social media and messaging apps, by informing them about the death of their relative and attaching a picture of the mutilated corpse and passport. While many Western outlets went on to described Ukraine’s actions as morally acceptable and almost humanitarian, one has to seriously question whether the same positive perception would apply if the Islamic State were to directly contact US families by sending them pictures of their relative’s mutilated corpse via social media. To argue that this is just a form of humanitarian outreach clearly ignores the overarching information warfare campaign that Ukraine is waging against Russian society at-large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the IT Army, as of 4 April the Ukrainian government successfully identified 582 corpses with the help of Clearview. The exact figure was likely supplied to the IT Army by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, Ukraine’s intelligence services, or the Ministry of Digital Transformation. None of the Clearview aspects were ever mentioned in the IT Army channel or chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 6 April, the IT Army posted a four-minute video which showed them calling the family of a Russian soldier who allegedly looted around 100 kilograms of goods in Ukraine. The loot was sent via mail from a post office in Moyzr, Belarus, to the town of Chita in the far east of Russia. The IT Army’s video identifies the precise weight of the six packages the soldier paid for (totalling around 100 kg), as well as the phone number and address of the recipient (the soldier’s brother). The video also shows the CCTV feed of several Russian soldiers with their packages in the same post office. At the beginning of the phone call, the IT Army makes legal threats by pretending to be the FSB. The call ends with the IT Army saying, “we know where you live, where your brother lives, we know everything about your family. You will be responsible for every action that you have done on the territory of Ukraine”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IT Army subsequently published two similar videos on 8 April and 9 April. In the first one, a Russian soldier sends 16 kg from the Mozyr post office to his wife in Novosibirsk, Russia. And in the second one, a different Russian soldier sends 63 kg to his wife in Khabarovsk, Russia. The CCTV video is the same in all three videos which suggests that all three Russian soldiers visited the Mozyr post office together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is still unclear how the IT Army gained access to all the information necessary to run this operation. How did they know the exact Belarus post office these Russian soldiers would use? Did they breach the CCTV camera in the post office or was the footage given to them by another agency? As of this writing there are no answers to these questions, and none of the operational details of the calls were discussed in the IT Army channel or chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we do know is that on 2 June 2022, two months after the IT Army released the three videos, the Ukrainian Cyberpolice, in conjunction with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), utilized the exact CCTV footage to announce the identification of 10 Russian Rosgard soldiers from military unit 6720 that looted the homes of residents in Bucha, Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we do not know who got their hands on the CCTV footage first or who oversaw this intelligence gathering operation, we can conclude that either the IT Army supplied the footage to the Cyberpolice and the SBU, or the SBU was overseeing the entire operation and utilized both the IT Army and the Cyberpolice as vehicles for their outreach components, publishing the three calls in April and announcing the soldier idenfications in June. On 16 June, the National Police of Ukraine posted a video on Youtube which showed the usage of Clearview by the Ukrainian Cyberpolice to identify the Russian soldiers in the post office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 7 April, the IT Army revealed its most sophisticated campaign to date which targeted a Russian Instagram clone called Rossgram. Prior to the official release of the Rossgram app at the end of March, the IT Army claimed to have (1) breached Rossgram’s beta sign-up database, (2) created a fake Rossgram app, (3) sent invites to all the beta sign-ups, (4) pushed out notifications to all those who installed the fake app that Rossgram was hacked, and then (5) leaked the beta sign-up database to the public. To date, this is the only hack-and-leak operation for which the IT Army has taken direct credit. None of this was discussed in the IT Army’s Telegram channel and chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 14 May, the IT Army took credit for the destructive campaign against RuTube. RuTube is a Russian Youtube competitor that was created back in 2006. In mid-March, RuTube’s viewership began to skyrocket as Youtube – in reaction to the war in Ukraine – effectively pushed Russian content creators and users off its platform by suspending Google’s advertising system in Russia. Given the rapid growth of RuTube and the significant decline of independent media reporting in Russia, the IT Army identified RuTube as the “main information center for Russian false propaganda”. Timed to coincide with Russia’s Victory Day celebrations on 9 May 2022, the IT Army – with the help of “two specialists” – subsequently ran a destructive campaign against RuTube starting the night of 8 May. According to the IT Army’s video, the campaign successfully (a) changed all administrator passwords, (b) blocked all the access cards that were needed to enter and exit RuTube’s server rooms, (c) deleted “dozens of petabytes of information”, (d) “demolished all systems – virtualization, databases, content, converter, content search systems, advertising module, load distribution systems and management of the entire infrastructure”, and (e) exfiltrated internal information from the computers of the RuTube administrators and employees. The attack against RuTube is the first ever destructive campaign for which the IT Army has taken credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RuTube remained offline for almost three days with partial access being restored on 11 May: Recovery commenced in stages. According to RuTube’s official Telegram channel, Russian cybersecurity company Positive Technologies helped to investigate and remediate the attack. RuTube also explained that “there have been many attacks on RUTUBE that have been successfully localized. However, the 9 May incident was of a different level of complexity. The readiness of the infrastructure for such a targeted attack can only be established by encountering it”. On 14 May, the site seemed to have been fully restored from its backups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, it is still unknown how large the IT Army’s in-house team is, or who exactly is tasking and feeding them information. The in-house team likely consists of members located in Ukraine and Ukrainians living abroad. As of this writing, the IT Army has open vacancies for pentesters, desktop developers, hackers, system administrators, graphic designers, and, most importantly, connoisseurs of English. The vacancy site describes the in-house team’s tasks as “hacking enemy resources, spreading viruses, creating phishing sites, and inflicting maximum damage on the [Russian] economy and other public spheres”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curiously, on 18 May, the IT Army channel put out a crowdsourcing call for information, stating that “we need your help in finding databases with phone numbers of private individuals and legal entities from the occupied Crimea as well as Russian regions next to the Ukrainian border (Briansk, Kursk, Belgorod). You can send this information to itarmyua@gmail.com”. Four days later, the IT Army thanked everyone that sent in information, and put out a second request for help, stating, “we need your help in finding databases with the phone numbers of Russians who fall under one of the following categories: (a) “young people who have radical views and are into working out (e.g. bouncers, members of martial arts groups)”, (b) “draftee (people who might be conscripted for military service)”, (c) “students”, and (d) “military service offices employees and their relatives”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this writing it is still unknown for what purpose the IT Army has been collecting this information. It might end up being used by the in-house team for one of their upcoming campaigns, it could be forwarded to the Internet Forces of Ukraine for an information warfare operation, or it could even be utilized to organize Russians in Russia to act against the Russian state apparatus. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-are-ukraines-intel-services&quot;&gt;Where are Ukraine’s intel services?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IT Army is the main hub for Ukraine’s “offensive” response in cyberspace in reaction to the Russian invasion. Parallel to this cyber effort, the Internet Forces of Ukraine were stood up on 28 February to wage the nation’s “offensive” campaign in the information warfare domain. The focus of the Internet Forces is on organizing political pressure campaigns abroad and disseminating Ukrainian war propaganda via social media, including Telegram, VKontakte, Discord, and Reddit. The Ministry of Digital Transformation has taken public credit for establishing both the IT Army and the Internet Forces of Ukraine on 10 March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it currently stands, the IT Army and the Internet Forces are publicly portrayed as two civilian-led government projects that function entirely separately from Ukraine’s military command structure and maintain no links whatsoever to the nation’s intelligence services. From a purely institutional point of view, however, it is highly questionable whether the Ministry of Digital Transformation has the legal authority to independently setup the IT Army and the Internet Forces without any coordination or control exercised by Ukraine’s defense and intelligence services. For Ukraine’s defense and intelligence services to roll their thumbs and let the IT Army and Internet Forces conduct operations freely and independently – particularly during war time – seems to be not only an analytical stretch but would highly likely also lead to strategic confusion and tactical interference with the defense and intelligence services’ own operations in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also questionable whether the Ministry of Digital Transformation has the necessary in-house skills and knowledge that underpins the cyber and information warfare operations the IT Army and Internet Forces have been conducting. Talking to Wired, Anton Melnyk, who is an advisor to the Ministry of Digital Transformation, explained that “we have restructured the Ministry of Digital Transformation into a clear military organization”. Similarly, speaking to Politico on 8 March, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation Oleksandr Bornyakov noted that “we are the first in the world to introduce this new warfare. And it’s powerful, yet simple at the same time. … It’s impossible to disrupt it or break it down”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in March 2022, Dina Temple-Raston interviewed one of the eight administrators of the IT Army channel for The Record. Probably the most interesting exchange occurred right at the beginning when Dina asked: “Do you have a military background?” The administrator answered, “Um, sort of … It’s not the questions I can answer you fully because it may lead to a better understanding of what kind of person I am”. While we cannot be certain, we can somewhat infer that any statement on having served in the three main service branches would not have provided peculiar insights – i.e., the statement “I was in the Navy” could mean anything from being a cook to a naval demolition specialist. But the outright refusal to say anything may hint at an intelligence background. Similarly, it is highly unlikely that an unvetted random person on the internet is being entrusted with the role of administrating the IT Army channel and overseeing a community of close to 300,000 subscribers to organize Bornyakov’s “new warfare”. At a minimum one would expect some level of social media campaigning or government coordination experience, and at a maximum an intelligence/military background in cyber or information warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, from the Russian perspective, the IT Army and Internet Forces likely maintain close relations – or might even be extensions – of Ukraine’s 72nd Center for Informational and Psychological Operations in Brovary/Kyiv. The 72nd Center was stood up back in 2003 in Sevastopol as part of Ukraine’s Special Operations Forces and was one of the last military units that resisted the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014. Until recently, the 72nd was Ukraine’s main center that specialized in information and psychological operations. Very little is publicly known about the internal structure and operations the 72nd has conducted in the past, and given the current war context, it is rather difficult to distinguish between reliable new information and Russian war propaganda. For example, according to the Russian International Affairs Council, the 72nd is not only involved in intelligence, subversion, and counterintelligence activities, but also conducts “propaganda information campaigns in telecommunications networks and the Internet, and, together with the [Security Service of Ukraine], coordinate the activities of Ukrainian patriotic hacker groups, volunteer information communities and Internet resources”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we definitely do know is that on 1 March the Russian Defense Ministry proclaimed that “information attacks on Russia are carried out by the 72nd Main Center for Information and Psychological Operations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, together with the cyber operations units of the SBU, using hardware and software systems and communication facilities in Kyiv”. The Ministry went on to explain that “in order to thwart informational attacks against Russia, [Russian forces] will strike technological objects of the [Security Service of Ukraine] and the 72nd Main [Psychological Operations] Center in Kiev”. On 2 March, Russian air strikes took out the SBU’s headquarter, the 72nd Center, as well as a building that housed the control room of Kyiv’s TV tower. Notably, as of this writing, no Russian airstrike has been directed at the building of the Ministry of Digital Transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another somewhat related piece to the puzzle appeared on 7 March, when cybersecurity consultant Jeffrey Carr published an article on his substack Inside Cyber Warfare, which claimed that the Beloyarsk Nuclear Power Plant in Zarechny, Russia, was breached by cyber operators from the Main Intelligence Department of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense (GURMO). According to Carr, GURMO exfiltrated “a large amount of data including contracts, architectural diagrams, alarm system configurations, set-up instructions for control system parts”. It is highly questionable whether Carr ought to be considered a reliable source. As he himself explains, “the problem was that journalists wanted to speak to GURMO and that was off the table. … They could speak with me because I was the only person who the GURMO team would directly speak to”. Given the unverifiability of Carr’s claims, journalists were rightfully not willing to put their reputation on the line for a single-sourced story. As of this writing, Carr has published 16 additional pieces claiming that GURMO breached Roscosmos, Gazprom, the communication servers of the Black Fleet, as well as the FSB’s Special Operations Unit 607. None of these claims have been verified. In early April, Carr even went as far as insinuating that GURMO gained access to Gazprom’s pressurization controls, supposedly leading to the physical rupture and fire at two Russian pipelines. There is zero evidence that supports Carr’s story. What is similarly problematic is that Carr claims to be in possession of the complete data leaks that GURMO allegedly exfiltrated, but only paying subscribers to his substack are allowed access. Why does he not approach DDoSecrets like Anonymous has frequently done to publish its data leaks? Why is GURMO only using Carr as their public representative and no one else – not even the IT Army, Internet Forces, or any of the well-established professional journalists covering cyber? Given the absence of logical answers, Carr’s substack ought to be read with great caution. Having said that, Carr’s reporting does present an easy answer to the question as to what Ukraine’s intelligence services have been up to in cyberspace. If we treat Carr’s pieces at face value, then GURMO is primarily focusing on hack-and-leak operations that have even less immediate impact on the course of the war than those conducted by Anonymous and other hacking groups since the start of the invasion. Similarly, if viewed in relation to the strategic and public impact the IT Army and Internet Forces have had on Russian society, private companies, and foreign governments, then GURMO’s activities are close to irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The absence of known activities by Cloud Atlas – the only advanced persistent threat (APT) actor that might be of Ukrainian origin – amidst the Russian invasion is another mystery that has not yet been solved. Overall, there are currently no good answers to the question of what Ukraine’s intelligence and defense agencies are doing offensively in cyberspace. The only logical answer with the current evidence at hand is that the Ukrainian intelligence services are likely deeply intertwined with the IT Army’s DDoS targeting and tasking flow, the Internet Forces’ information warfare activities, and the IT Army’s in-house operations. Assertions that Ukrainian intelligence and defense agencies are not involved at all in any of these activities are either naïve or – at this point – wilfully ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-it-army-and-external-groups&quot;&gt;The IT Army and External Groups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source intelligence researcher CyberKnow has assembled the most comprehensive overview of all the different hacking groups/individuals that have popped up since the Russian invasion. On 1 May, CyberKnow identified 74 active groups/individuals, 46 pro-Ukraine, 26 pro-Russia, and two whose allegiance is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the IT Army’s DDoS cooperation with a variety of groups on Telegram, there is very little known about how the IT Army views groups such as the Belarusian Cyber Partisans and the numerous sub-groups that are operating under the banner of Anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Partisans were formed back in September 2020 in reaction to the protests and subsequent violent crackdown following the contested presidential election in Belarus. The group’s first known public hack was the defacement of the website of the Belarusian Presidency on 2 September 2020. Only nine days later, the Partisans conducted one of their most impactful hack-and-leak operation to date by sharing a vast database of Belarusian law enforcement officers with NEXTA, which has become the biggest Russian-speaking Telegram channel/media outlet covering the protests in Belarus. In August 2021, the Partisans became one of the three founding organizations of the Belarusian resistance alliance Suprativ. The other two are the Flying Storks, who are conducting resistant activities outside of cyberspace, and the People’s Self-Defense Squads, who are publishing training videos and self-defense instructions. In the context of the war in Ukraine, the Partisans rose to international fame when they ran a ransomware campaign against the IT systems of Belarusian Railways on 24 January 2022 to disrupt the movement of Russian tanks and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;Anonymous&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Anonymous is an umbrella term for a decentralized collection of activities that feed into the global Anonymous movement and its diffuse ideology. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, several prominent Anonymous information hubs on social media accounts announced the beginning of Operation Russia or #OpRussia. Generally speaking, each Anonymous group/personality conducts their own operations. Occasionally, Anonymous groups/personalities loosely run operations together, and sometimes they might even breach the same target during similar time frames by pure coincidence. As of this writing, OpRussia has primarily consisted of DDoS attacks and hack-and-leak operations against Russian private companies and government digital infrastructure. What is important to stress is that each Anonymous group/personality has its own political motive and ethical reasoning. Sometimes these motives can generate initial approval and subsequent severe backlash from other Anonymous groups, as was the case when an Anonymous personality known as I_am_Mr_Grey (about 8,000 Twitter followers) announced Operation Falling Star in early April 2022. Grey essentially threatened that Anonymous would hack satellites in orbit and make them fall out of the sky. In a now deleted tweet with a video, Grey declared, “Dear NATO / UN / Putin – a message for you. We give you the rise of operation Falling Star. Should Putin attempt a second invasion and you NATO / UN does nothing, this SHALL be your fate”. Grey was subsequently ridiculed and ostracized to the point that he grovelingly apologized for his behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first item to note is that both the Belarusian Cyber Partisans and almost all groups operating under the banner of Anonymous are primarily active on Twitter. The IT Army by contrast exclusively operates on Telegram. That being said, the closest to an official IT Army representative on Twitter is an account called sudo rm -RF (@sudormRF6), who says that he represents the “Ukrainian Cyber Front”. The connection between sudo rm -RF and the IT Army consists of at least three data points. First, sudo rm -RF posted the Rossgram beta-sign up database on 29 March 2022, – one week prior to the IT Army releasing its video on Rossgram – using the file sharing service Mega.nz. Second, sudo rm -RF posted several screenshots of RuTube’s internal folders, documents, and source code on 10 May – four days prior to the IT Army posting its video about RuTube. And third, the sudo rm -RF account appears for eight seconds in the IT Army’s RuTube video, during which the narrator discusses “gradually publishing [RuTube internal documents] on the Mega.nz file sharing service”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except for sudo rm -RF, all other accounts that claim to represent the IT Army of Ukraine on Twitter are neither affiliated nor officially endorsed by the IT Army. This includes the 45,600 or so follower strong ITarmyUA account which many individuals in the Anonymous movement portrayed as being the official IT Army Twitter account. In fact, almost every time Anonymous claims to have cooperated with the IT Army they tag the ITarmyUA account in their tweets. Thus, when Twitter suspended ITarmyUA on 29 April, thousands of Twitter users viewed this as an act against Ukraine and fundamentally as political censorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone that bothered to take a closer look, it was immediately evident that ITArmyUA was a rebranded account created back in August 2018 that changed its user handle and scrubbed all its tweets prior to March 2022. No one in the IT Army’s Telegram channel ever mentioned or cared about the ITArmyUA account being suspended on Twitter. The official IT Army website does not link to the ITarmyUA account, and neither Mykhailo Federov nor the Ministry of Digital Transformation follows the ITarmyUA account on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does Anonymous’ outrage fit into the bigger picture? Looking at the dynamics and possible motives, it is highly likely that someone identifying with the Anonymous movement rebranded their account to pretend to be the IT Army on Twitter. The ITarmyUA account was then subsequently hyped by numerous Anonymous accounts to gain a massive Twitter following out of nowhere. The account was then utilized to provide legitimacy to the claims that Anonymous was actively cooperating with the IT Army, and by extension created the illusion that the Ukrainian government endorsed Anonymous’ actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anonymous’ desperate hunt for legitimacy and official government recognition has even led some groups to insert the Anonymous logo into copies of the IT Army’s official videos, and others went so far as to proclaim themselves to be the official international chapter of the IT Army of Ukraine. None of these claims has ever been acknowledged by the IT Army. In fact, the IT Army’s Telegram channel has only ever once used the word “anonymous” when they thanked the Telegram group Anonymous-Ukraine on 4 April for their DDoS cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the IT Army has shown little interest in officially displaying any closeness to the Anonymous movement. This behaviour is likely due to (a) Anonymous’ decentralized nature and not knowing who is speaking on whose behalf, and (b) Anonymous’ reputation as a loose cannon in general, where every group and individual does what they want for the sake of social media clout and public attention. As of this writing it is unknown whether the IT Army’s in-house team has occasionally cooperated with groups that are close to Anonymous. Repeated email inquiries to the IT Army to verify claims made by a handful of groups (including BeeHiveCybersec) have gone unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;belarusian-cyber-partisans&quot;&gt;Belarusian Cyber Partisans&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curiously, the Belarusian Cyber Partisans have also faced the same unresponsiveness from the IT Army. On 18 March, the Partisans wrote on Twitter that “we are willing to support [the IT Army] with intelligence, tools and ops. Sent them an email and then twitted about it. We did not get a reply from them as of yet”. When asked again on 29 April, the Partisans explained that we “haven’t managed to get a direct contact unfortunately”.180 As of this writing, the Partisans appear to have been unable to connect with the IT Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IT Army did target Belarusian sites on 27 February, when the channel announced 43 different sites to DDoS, including websites of the Belarusian government, media, banks, and industrial companies. The only other two instances in which the IT Army did so, was on 20 March – against the Belarusian site of Bitrix24, which is a cloud customer relationship management company headquartered in Virgina, US. And on 5 April, the IT Army targeted cdek.by – which is the Belarusian site of the Russian international express delivery company CDEK. Since 5 April, no Belarusian sites have been targeted by the IT Army. It is unclear whether this change is a deliberate restriction based on internal decisions, or simply an evolutionary process by which the IT Army has come to focus solely on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IT Army’s reluctance to talk to the Partisans might be following the same logic as it does vis-a-vis Anonymous. The IT Army does not have good answers to (a) who exactly the individuals are that make up the Partisans, (b) whether the IT Army can trust them, (c) what the Partisans underlying political motives are – given that they are part of the Belarusian resistance alliance Suprativ, (d) whether an IT Army-Partisan cooperation in cyberspace could be politically viewed as the Ukrainian government cooperating with the Belarusian opposition in exile, and (e) what the IT Army’s options are if the Partisans go off script with their activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the hybrid setup the IT Army has mastered requires a healthy sense of paranoia and the need to take operational security extremely seriously – to guard against Russian infiltrators and information breaches. Particularly in times of war, discerning between who is a friend, a foe, and everything else in between is an inherently complicated task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ipstress&quot;&gt;IPStress&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One curious external cooperation popped up in early May when the itarmy.com.ua website began to display its one and only partner on the bottom of its site: IPStress.in. According to IPStress itself, they are the best IP booter stresser that “can down any game server such as ovh, nfo, fivem servers etc. Bypassing every protection such as cloudflare with our blazingfast methods. Buy now and enjoy the strong power from our botnets as well”. That self-description got a bit weird, when in early 2022 the IPStress.in website started to use Cloudflare’s DDoS protection service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 31 May 2022, the FBI and the US Department of Justice announced the seizure of three internet domains: weleakinfo.to, ovhbooter.com, and ipstress.in. In the DoJ’s press release, US Attorney of the District of Columbia Matthew M. Graves explained that ipstress and ovhbooter “publicly offered to conduct ‘Distributed Denial of Service’ attacks, or ‘DDoS’ attacks for clients – specifically, a format called booter or stressor attacks. … The seizures of these domains were part of a coordinated law enforcement action with the National Police Corps of the Netherlands and the Federal Police of Belgium. The actions executed by our international partners included the arrest of a main subject, searches of several locations, and seizures of the webserver’s infrastructure”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simultaneous take down of all three domains and police raids in several locations suggests that this was the culmination of a months – if not year – long criminal investigation. Thus, the take down of IPStress.in did not occur in response to their partnership with the IT Army. Nonetheless it is rather disturbing that the IT Army – a Ukraine government-created entity – was willing to form and openly advertise its partnership with a cybercriminal DDoS enterprise. As of this writing, the IT Army website has changed its official partner to the hosting service ukraine.com.ua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of June 7, 2022, IPStress.in is still mentioned on the IT Army website under the official English translation for the section on “Friends and Partners of the IT Army of Ukraine”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On June 10, the Russian Foreign Ministry declared that “according to experts, in order to carry out massive DDoS attacks involving ‘cyber volunteers’, attackers use malicious software based on the servers of Hetzner (Germany) and DigitalOcean (USA) supplier companies. Foreign specialized platforms (War.Apexi.Tech, Ban-Dera.com) are actively used, the online capacities of IPstress.in and Google servers are regularly used”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IT Army of Ukraine is a unique and smart construct whose organizational setup and operational impact will likely inform the art of cyber and information warfare in future conflicts. On the public side, the IT Army serves as a vessel that allows the Ukrainian government to utilize volunteers from around the world in its persistent DDoS activities against Russian government and company websites. As of 7 June 2022, this includes 662 targets. On the non-public side, the IT Army’s in-house team likely maintains deep links to – or largely consists of – the Ukrainian defense and intelligence services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, both Kyiv and the Ukrainian IT community at large have shown the world what digital diplomacy on steroids looks like. Their conduct has collapsed entire pillars of existing legal frameworks regarding norms and rules for state behaviour in cyberspace and has taken apart the illusion of separating the defense of Ukraine from Ukrainian companies and citizen living abroad. As of this writing, EU and NATO member states have equally failed to adapt to – or even grasp – what the IT Army really is. Western observers and governments still believe that it is just a collection of random volunteers conducting meaningless DDoS attacks against Russian websites. They have so far failed to see the underlying organizational structure, operational conduct, and wider ecosystem that underpins the IT Army and Ukraine’s fight in the cyber and information domain. For better or worse, continuing to ignore the essence of the IT Army will wreak havoc on the future stability of cyberspace and with it the national security landscape in Europe and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many questions this report leaves unanswered or can only answer in varying degrees of certainty. Time will tell how the IT Army evolves from here on out and whether history will judge this report as being both balanced and objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some questions this report has not touched upon might be of interest to future research and policy discussions including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) How is it possible that the official IT Army website (itarmy.com.ua) and Cyber Palyanits (cyberarmy.com.ua) are protected by Cloudflare’s anti-DDoS service? On both sites users can find an assortment of DDoS tools and instructions. It seems rather odd that an anti-DDoS service like Cloudflare is protecting the very sites that are organizing the most impactful DDoS activities amidst the Ukraine war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) How is it possible that the IT Army’s official email account and application forms are hosted by Google, when the itarmy.com.ua site includes detailed instructions on how to misuse Google’s Cloud Servers for DDoS attacks? Does Google have a policy in place to deal with belligerents using its products in the context of an international armed conflict?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Does GitHub – and by extension Microsoft – have a policy in place to take down repositories/tooling specifically designed for users worldwide to participate in an international armed conflict? As of this writing, senior Microsoft executives have been publicly preaching about preventing cyberwar – while actively helping Ukraine defending its networks – yet none of the GitHub repositories mentioned in this report seems to violate GitHub’s terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) What are the economics of the IT Army and the ecosystem around it? Are cryptocurrency donations, influencer support, and holders of Hacken’s various tokens a major source of revenue to improve the IT Army’s DDoS infrastructure both in and outside Ukraine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) And what political prescedents are US software companies such as Clearview, Starlink, and maybe soon Palantir setting by offering their novel technologies and infrastructure to one belligerent in an international armed conflict? In the context of the Ukraine war, it might be easy for company executives to decide which belligerent to support. But what happens when that assessment runs counter to US foreign policy interests? Also, how should other governments – particularly those in Europe – view the conduct of these companies? Should they be seen as extensions of US foreign policy? Or are they independent actors? And if so, what strategic interests, foreign policies, and legal and ethical considerations underpins the conduct of those companies?&lt;/p&gt;

Russia’s war in Ukraine has created economic and diplomatic dilemmas for China, but it hasn’t altered the fundamental alignment of interests and autocratic values that drives that relationship.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;In this Marshall Paper, David Shullman and Andrea Kendall-Taylor explain why the Sino-Russian relationship will only get deeper as a result of the war — even as it reveals strains and divisions that the United States and its allies may, eventually, be able to exploit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian president Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has put China in a difficult position. Putin launched his war of aggression just weeks after meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping and declaring jointly their “no limits” partnership. China’s tacit backing of Russia clashes with Beijing’s stated support for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity and jeopardizes Beijing’s relations with Europe. Putin’s war of choice is compounding China’s Covid-19-related economic challenges, causing energy and food prices to rise, and the remarkable resilience of Ukraine and strong allied response have likely prompted China to reexamine its calculus on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some analysts and policymakers have posited, therefore, that Russia’s war in Ukraine will arrest the trajectory of deepening Russia-China relations, weakening the countries’ partnership. Indeed, there are data points that support this hypothesis. Chinese companies and banks have pulled back from new and ongoing initiatives in the Russian market to avoid Western sanctions, and Chinese official media recently granted Ukraine uncensored space to criticize the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, there will be limits to the “no limits” partnership. Beijing will undoubtedly seek to avoid provoking unnecessary blowback as a result of its support for its most important strategic partner. But make no mistake, China and Russia are fundamentally aligned — Moscow and Beijing share a view of the United States as their most important security challenge, and together they seek to erode U.S. power and influence. Unless Russia escalates its tactics in Ukraine, perhaps by using chemical or nuclear weapons, Russia-China relations will continue to deepen as a result of the conflict, regardless of its outcome. The countries’ growing coordination on security matters and efforts to shape a global order more favorable to their interests will increasingly complicate U.S. and allied strategic planning and efforts to push back against resurgent authoritarianism globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-aggression-in-ukraine-already-a-catalyst-for-deepening-ties&quot;&gt;Russian Aggression in Ukraine Already a Catalyst for Deepening Ties&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous Russian aggression in Ukraine has been a catalyst for deepening Russia-China relations. Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 significantly accelerated the slow warming of the relationship that started in the waning days of the Cold War. Convinced that it had no real economic opportunities in the West, the Kremlin turned to China for help in offsetting Western pressure. At that time, China’s initial support for Moscow was tepid. Beijing was vaguely critical of the West for supposedly causing the crisis, and it never verbally supported Russian annexation, abstained on key UN resolutions, and allowed Chinese firms to abide by U.S. and European sanctions. China also took advantage of Russia’s increased economic dependence to drive a hard bargain on key energy deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet Beijing eventually leaned into its partnership with Russia. While Moscow’s need to diversify away from the West energized relations, Beijing also came around to recognize the utility in building a stronger relationship with the Kremlin. In particular, the China-Russia partnership crystallized around a fundamentally similar view of the United States as a primary strategic threat. Both Xi and Putin view U.S. support for democracies in their regions — and for those fighting repression and authoritarianism inside China and Russia — as an effort to extend influence and ultimately overthrow their regimes. The leaders also view the U.S. alliance network — including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Quad grouping in the Indo-Pacific — as a direct challenge to their security and to their regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of 2014, these views hardened, especially as both countries’ relations with the United States grew more adversarial. Moreover, Xi and Putin have noted the increasing challenges facing Western democracies and have grown more confident that the United States and the West are in decline. They therefore view the time as ripe to challenge the U.S.-dominated global order and alliance network and hasten Washington’s retrenchment from their respective peripheries. Both also expect the United States to do everything in its power to hold onto its superpower status, particularly in the face of China’s rise, including coercing its allies to take actions against their own interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China’s deepening alignment since 2014, along with the complementarity of their needs and capabilities, has fueled growing ties across all dimensions of their partnership. In the economic sphere, for example, China’s share of Russia’s external trade doubled from 10 to 20 percent between 2013 and 2021. Their partnership deepened most notably in the defense domain and in their common crusade against democracy and the universality of human rights. Arms sales and technical cooperation have grown, as have the frequency, scope, and complexity of their joint military exercises. In the democracy domain, Moscow and Beijing together are popularizing authoritarian governance, exporting their best practices, watering down human rights norms, backing each other up in multilateral forums, creating norms around cyber and internet sovereignty, and bolstering illiberal leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these developments since 2014, China is once again treading carefully in the aftermath of Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine. China has abstained from voting on key UN resolutions, and Chinese firms are tentative about maintaining operations with Russia, given their desire to avoid secondary sanctions. The key difference, reflecting the much deeper starting point of their relationship going into this crisis, has been China’s far stronger rhetorical support for Russia. Senior Chinese officials not only indicated support for the Kremlin’s “reasonable security concerns” about potential NATO expansion as a justification for its initial actions but have since doubled down on pledges to deepen ties with Russia, parroting Russian talking points about its actions in Ukraine and the culpability of the United States and NATO for the conflict’s endurance. To signal their enduring close partnership, Russia and China flew joint patrols near Japanese and South Korean air defense zones in May 2022 during President Joe Biden’s trip to Asia designed to rally America’s U.S. Indo-Pacific allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If past precedent repeats, China’s initially cautious support for Russia’s invasion will yield to bolder backing for Moscow and efforts to deepen the partnership once the international spotlight moves away from events in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;personalized-politics-shaping-xis-calculus-on-russia&quot;&gt;Personalized Politics Shaping Xi’s Calculus on Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as in 2014, Russia will be the more eager partner. This time around, however, Russia is even more ostracized from Europe and the United States than it was in 2014, and its future economic prospects in the West are even more dire given the far more robust Western response to Russian actions in Ukraine. In other words, Russia now has no options other than China, and so it will be all in and willing to accept whatever support it can get from Beijing. Moreover, Moscow’s focus on the perceived threat from the West and its substantial domestic challenges will overshadow concerns in the Kremlin about the risks of its increasingly junior partner status with China. For these reasons, Moscow will be even more invested in and eager to pursue deeper relations with China than it was after 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If past precedent repeats, China’s initially cautious support for Russia’s invasion will yield to bolder backing for Moscow and efforts to deepen the partnership once the international spotlight moves away from events in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That puts China squarely in the driver’s seat in determining the future trajectory of the relationship. The key question then becomes: how is Xi likely to respond to Moscow and the political dynamics that Putin’s invasion has unleashed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief posits that along with the underlying drivers of Russia-China relations discussed above, the increasing personalization of China’s political system will be an ever more important dynamic shaping Xi’s decisionmaking, including on Russia. Because Putin is further along in his personalization of the Russian system, lessons can be drawn from Putin’s behaviors that are instructive and that offer insight into how Xi — whose dominance increasingly rivals that of Mao himself — is likely to approach his relationship with Russia. Of course, there are differences between Russia’s and China’s political systems. China’s Leninist system is undergirded by the pervasive and mounting reach of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) across state and society and its monopoly on political organization that precludes the possibility of organized opposition. Putin’s Russia, in contrast, is far more brittle, and the weakness of United Russia, the party of power that supports Putin despite him not being a member of the party, means that personalism in Russia is more pronounced. Nonetheless, there are lessons to be gleaned from the behavior of Putin’s personalist regime that provide insights into how Xi is likely to approach his closest partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upholding a strongman image defined in relation to the United States.&lt;/strong&gt; Putin has long sought to portray himself as a strongman whose power and influence are on par with that of the president of the United States. For Putin, part of his image as a strong leader has stemmed from his portrayal of the United States in particular as an external enemy. Indeed, the creation of threats and enemies is a tried-and-true tactic for many personalist authoritarian leaders, who use such threats to portray themselves as uniquely positioned to counter those threats, as well as to deflect blame for domestic troubles and justify their repressive measures. Putin’s political reliance on sustaining confrontation with the United States and fear of looking weak or backing down in the face of Western pressure has been a consistent factor limiting what is possible in U.S.-Russia relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi is also increasingly driven by the need to maintain his strongman image, which will limit any inclination to back away from his investment in his partnership with Putin. The CCP has long painted the United States and other “foreign forces” as enemies to bolster popular legitimacy with domestic audiences. Xi’s dominance within China’s political system has become uniquely associated with China’s drive for “rejuvenation” as a great power second to none, especially in Washington. Xi, like Putin, will therefore be unwilling to be seen as backing down to U.S. pressure, including regarding China’s support for Moscow. Because the two leaders have personalized their relationship — indeed their personal rapport has been a key driver of the deepening partnership — backing away from Putin may also be seen as an admission of a faulty strategy. Xi’s need to avoid the perception of either having made significant errors or acquiescing to Washington is especially acute this year, with challenges around his zero-Covid policy and a flagging economy already complicating his drive to further establish his supremacy at the 20th Party Congress this fall. Xi’s amplification of the United States as an enemy and his personal investment in his relationship with Putin suggest that Xi will sustain his partnership with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backing fellow autocrats.&lt;/strong&gt; Since 2012, when Xi assumed leadership and Putin returned to the presidency, both leaders have prioritized efforts to push back against what they view as U.S. efforts to topple unfriendly regimes. For both, countering so-called “color revolutions” has been critical not just for pushing back against what they see as unacceptable U.S. unilateralism but also for protecting against what they assume is the ultimate goal: regime change in Moscow and Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin has gone to great lengths to shore up embattled dictators — including Belarus’s Aleksandr Lukashenko, Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, Kazakhstan’s Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, and Venezuela’s Nicholas Maduro — to prevent these leaders from being toppled at the hands of foreign pressure. Putin has also viewed the backing of like-minded autocrats as critical to building his image with onlooking leaders as a reliable partner willing and able to compete with Washington as a security provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi has similarly backed illiberal regimes in his periphery, including in Myanmar and Cambodia, and has complemented Russian efforts to shore up embattled leaders such as Maduro and Tokayev. The CCP — and Xi personally — have leaned into propaganda about the superiority of China’s authoritarian system and the relative weakness of democracies during the pandemic. Like Putin, Xi is driven not only by the need to defend against Western efforts to use color revolutions to weaken regime control but also the need to prevent authoritarian failures that might tarnish views of his increasingly strongman rule at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi is therefore likely to seek to prevent Putin, his closest friend and partner, from falling. Indeed, Xi would view the prospect of a collapse of Putin’s regime as a direct threat to his rule in the wake of his personal and public endorsements of the Russian leader. China’s population must not witness the popular overthrow of Putin, China’s partner in promoting an alternative vision for effective authoritarian governance and standing up to interference from the lecturing West. Furthermore, Xi does not want to set a precedent where a U.S.-led sanctions and pressure campaign among allied democracies is permitted to successfully unseat unfriendly leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pursuing increasingly assertive foreign policies and surprises.&lt;/strong&gt; A robust body of political science research shows that personalist dictatorships tend to produce the most risky and aggressive foreign policies. In Russia, Putin’s personalization of the political system and dismantling of the constraints on his decisionmaking undoubtedly led to increasingly risky behavior in pursuit of his foreign policy objectives. His tight control over the media ensures that the public receives only the official narrative of foreign events, limiting his accountability to the public and providing him with the latitude for risk-taking. His elimination of competing voices within his regime not only further ensures that he faces minimal accountability for his foreign policy actions but also creates an echo chamber in which debate is curtailed and he receives only the information that supports his preferred policies and approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Xi would view the prospect of a collapse of Putin’s regime as a direct threat to his rule in the wake of his personal and public endorsements of the Russian leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to his increasing propensity for risk, Putin’s personalization has made it more difficult to gauge his foreign policy calculus, as decisions are made increasingly by the whims of one man relying on often incomplete and faulty information. This creates challenges for U.S. national security analysts who often rule out certain scenarios because the costs appear to outweigh the benefits for a leader. When leaders make choices with incomplete or inaccurate information, it becomes increasingly difficult to gauge their calculus. Partially for that reason, many analysts failed to predict Putin’s decision to illegally annex Crimea in 2014 and insert forces into Syria in 2015 and predicted that Putin would not reinvade Ukraine in 2022. The growing personalization of Putin’s regime means that analysts have been regularly surprised by Putin’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In China, constraints on Xi’s decisionmaking have similarly withered, and his opinion is increasingly the only one that matters on key foreign policy issues, raising the prospect that Xi could also surprise with his actions. In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China’s foreign policymaking system recycled messaging in line with standing guidance while waiting for indications of any change in policy from Xi himself. Propaganda within China increasingly portrays Xi as the great defender of the Chinese nation, who will right the wrongs of the “century of humiliation” and restore respect for China on the world stage. This narrative potentially ties Xi’s hands in managing a flexible foreign policy and almost compels him to take a more aggressive and recalcitrant position in international affairs.1 Much of China’s “wolf warrior” diplomacy in recent years is aimed at bolstering nationalist support for Xi’s regime, even as it sours Beijing’s relations abroad. Actors in the system are increasingly unwilling to share information or critical opinions that might taint them as insufficiently supportive of Xi’s directives, creating an echo chamber that confirms the wisdom of greater risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese public has ingested a steady stream of propaganda excusing Russia’s actions in — not invasion of — Ukraine and blaming the United States and NATO for fanning the flames of war. This messaging is complemented by swift censorship of calls for China to reconsider siding with Russia against the West, where its most critical economic relationships exist. Citizens are primed to support Xi’s unwavering support for Putin, shielded from the perspectives of others and readily mobilized by one-sided nationalistic arguments. Xi is thus able to undertake risky actions designed primarily to defend a fellow authoritarian regime rather than advance China’s national interests, confident in the knowledge that the public will only receive information that confirms the wisdom of backing Russia and censors that which would highlight the cost, for example, of alienating Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Xi faces mounting economic and other challenges at home and looks to prevent the emergence of elite pushback against his policies — including the wisdom of so publicly aligning with Russia just ahead of its invasion — he may increasingly double down on aggressive policies that burnish his nationalist credentials and discredit detractors as insufficiently tough. If trends continue, he will do so without complete or accurate information regarding the costs of his actions. Therefore, it should not be surprising if Xi backs Putin in ways that do not accord with assessments of what is in China’s national interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;all-paths-lead-to-partnership&quot;&gt;All Paths Lead to Partnership&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is plausible that the trajectory of the war in Ukraine will determine the course of the Russia-China relationship. Some analysts have argued, for example, that if Putin faces a clear defeat, Xi will look to distance himself from a weakened and discredited partner. This brief posits, however, that all roads lead to partnership. Except in the still unlikely case in which Russia uses chemical or nuclear weapons, China and Russia will deepen their ties irrespective of the outcome of the war in Ukraine, leaving the two more clearly aligned in an anti-Western partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how the war in Ukraine ends, Russia will indeed emerge as a weakened and more isolated country. This result will not, however, weaken its bonds with China. Russia’s new reality will make Moscow more dependent on China, and previous concerns about the growing asymmetry between the two countries — long touted as a constraint on future Russia-China relations — will be overshadowed by the Kremlin’s sense of threat from the West and internal challenges. For China and Xi, meanwhile, a weakened Russia would create some urgency for China to mitigate pressure imposed on Putin that could destabilize him internally. Chinese leaders judge that if Putin falls, the United States would be free to focus all its attention on countering China’s rise and undermining the CCP’s grip on power. Greater Western pressure could be even more difficult to manage if it occurs in tandem with the imperative to navigate relations with a post-Putin Russia that could adopt a less friendly approach to China and prompt newfound concerns about security along their shared 2,600-mile border. Moreover, Russia’s diminished strength could be useful in that it makes Moscow even more dependent on China and, therefore, a more loyal partner in Beijing’s fight against the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Regardless of how the war in Ukraine ends, Russia will indeed emerge as a weakened and more isolated country. This result will not, however, weaken its bonds with China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critically, it remains unclear just how weakened Russia will be. Yes, Putin made a mistake in Ukraine, but it is not a fatal one. Moscow will be economically weaker and increasingly isolated, but Russia will retain sufficient capacity and resolve to threaten U.S. and European interests. To illustrate, many of the military capabilities that the United States worries about most — Russia’s submarines, strategic and tactical nuclear arsenal, and cyber and electronic warfare capabilities — are untouched by the war in Ukraine. Moreover, Russia will retain the intent to challenge the West. If anything, the more devastating the defeat in Ukraine, the more dangerous Putin’s Russia may become. The Kremlin has unleashed a torrent of nationalist rhetoric inside Russia. Putin will have to find opportunities to satiate those sentiments and demonstrate that Russia is a power that should still be feared. For Xi, in other words, Russia, even in a weakened and isolated state after the war, will remain a nuclear superpower that distracts the United States from the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, for both Xi and Putin, the value of the relationship deepens whether the U.S.-led allied response continues to prove effective or ultimately appears to break down. If the allies’ unity breaks down in the face of Russia’s continued aggression — a seemingly unlikely prospect at this point — or even if Europe ultimately gives China a pass on its support for Russia, with key players such as Germany reducing critical rhetoric over time and resuming the deepening of economic ties with Beijing, it shows clearly the utility of partnership in fending off future U.S.-led pressure campaigns, support for color revolutions in their periphery, and perceived efforts to undermine regime control. China will learn that it has a free hand to deepen ties with Russia, including helping it distract and counter the United States, without suffering damage to valuable ties with Europe. Putin will learn both that he can withstand NATO and U.S. pressure with Xi by his side because Europe will not take China on and that China’s support mitigates Russia’s isolation on the global stage, diluting Western pressure and allowing onlooking countries to hedge their bets rather than pick a side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a continued strong and united U.S. and European front demonstrating to China real costs for complicity in Russia’s actions would also draw the countries closer together. Rather than forcing Xi to rethink the wisdom of aligning with Russia against the West, Beijing’s surprise at Washington’s ability to rally European allies that China has been trying to pull away will only harden Beijing’s view of the difficult struggle ahead against the United States. Xi will perceive the need to prevent Putin’s failure and ensure his partnership in dealing with an emboldened United States that has demonstrated the democratic world is capable of taking strong actions. In particular, Chinese leaders will view Russia as a partner in reducing China’s reliance on the U.S.-centric global financial system in the wake of the strong financial measures undertaken against Moscow. And Putin obviously has learned how much he needs Xi to survive against a surprisingly strong democratic world that wants to weaken Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long-term alignment between Russia and China is not inevitable. If anything, Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine underscores that there are fissures in their relationship. For one, Russia is clearly more risk-tolerant than Beijing. The Kremlin’s comfort with instability stands in stark contrast to the CCP’s strong preference for the stability that is required to protect and facilitate its economic equities and cultivate a reputation based on prudence. Yet, despite the natural fissures in their partnership, the United States has so far had little leverage to exacerbate the tensions between them. This does not mean that Washington should not try. Moving forward, U.S. policymakers should be mindful of these divisions and look for ways to pull at the seams of their relationship with the goal of limiting what each country is willing to do with or for the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One looming juncture in the Russia-China partnership where the United States and the West have an opportunity to shape the trajectory will be President Putin’s departure from power. Although Putin is likely to be able to weather backlash from the war in Ukraine, his hold on power is undoubtedly weaker now than it was before his invasion, meaning his departure could come sooner than would have been expected prior to the war. Leadership change in Russia provides an opportunity for the United States and Europe to take steps to limit the depth of the Russia-China partnership. Although it is likely that any future Russian leader will seek to maintain a close and stable relationship with Beijing, a future Russian leader could choose to pursue a more balanced approach to Russian foreign policy. Beijing, having grown accustomed to Russia’s increasingly junior status in their relationship and reliant on its ability to divide Washington’s attention, may balk at a new leader’s efforts to rebalance ties. U.S. and European efforts to engage a post-Putin Russia, therefore, have the potential to mitigate the urgency with which Russia depends on China. But how should the United States and Europe approach a post-Putin Russia? What, if anything, will be on offer from the West? The answers to these questions are still unknown, but Washington and its allies should consider, among other factors, the risks stemming from sustained and deepening Russia-China relations when calibrating a transatlantic approach to a post-Putin Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the historical track record of personalist regimes such as those in Russia and increasingly China shows that they are the most prone of any regime type to make mistakes. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is a devastating example of the blunders that personalist leaders can make. Although such mistakes are unlikely to disrupt the foundations of the Russia-China relationship, their missteps provide opportunities for the West to exploit. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and Xi’s adherence to draconian Covid-19 policies have weakened the allure of their authoritarian models. Such mistakes are likely to be few and far between, and so the United States and its allies should be prepared to use their mistakes to grow the headwinds that Russia and China face in their efforts to undermine the United States and rewrite the global rules in ways more consistent with their authoritarian norms. It will be difficult in the foreseeable future to drive Russia and China apart. But by finding opportunities to limit the depth of their partnership and increase the headwinds they face, navigating the challenges posed by Russia-China relations becomes an infinitely more manageable proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web of polices and norms that has preserved peace in the Taiwan Strait for four decades is stretched to the breaking point. The Taiwanese people, despite living in a mature democracy, remain trapped in an international accommodation agreed on by the United States, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Beijing, and Taiwan’s own previous authoritarian regime. Today, each successive generation in Taiwan finds the notion of political unification with the mainland less appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s leaders, however, are intent on preserving the dictatorship of the CCP, which entails asserting control over all of China’s claimed territories, including Taiwan. Meanwhile, the current U.S. administration has adopted a foreign policy doctrine of global democratic renewal amid strategic competition — with China named as “the only competitor potentially capable of combining its economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to mount a sustained challenge.” The shrinking common ground among the three capitals’ respective One China policies will soon vanish, incentivizing CCP general secretary Xi Jinping to take action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) did not possess the capabilities to annex Taiwan using military force. Today, Beijing’s more modern and capable military presents, or will soon present, such an option to Beijing. Testifying to Congress in May 2022, U.S. director of national intelligence Avril Haines agreed that the threat to Taiwan is “critical, or acute, between now and 2030.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The shrinking common ground among the three capitals’ respective One China policies will soon vanish, incentivizing CCP general secretary Xi Jinping to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In deciding whether to exercise such an option, Xi will weigh the risk of failure and anticipated costs of action. To increase his risk perception, Taipei and Washington should urgently enhance military deterrence with sufficient cost-effective, resilient capabilities to deny, or at least delay, a Chinese invasion force. To raise Xi’s cost perception, Washington should abandon political hedging and enhance deterrence messages that credibly signal U.S. resolve across diplomatic, military, and economic spheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to deterring China, clearer signals of U.S. resolve over Taiwan would reassure allies and partners, some of whom would likely respond by enhancing their own deterrence contributions, creating a virtuous cycle. Some nascent steps are bearing fruit — but more can and should be done. First, Washington should consistently highlight Beijing’s failure to honor its promise to pursue a peaceful resolution. Second, the American Institute in Taiwan should publicize training and interactions between U.S. service members and their Taiwanese counterparts. Third, President Joe Biden should explicitly authorize the imposition of financial, trade, and immigration restrictions on China in the event of an attack on Taiwan. Finally, the executive branch should consult with Congress to ensure the former has the tools to compete effectively across the spectrum of conflict, including in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;taipeis-one-china&quot;&gt;Taipei’s One China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the CCP’s quintennial Party Congress in late 2022, Xi will likely renew his tenure as general secretary of the party, promote many of his loyalists, and retire most of his detractors from within the party. Just as these promotions and retirements will dictate China’s future governance, Taiwan’s January 2024 presidential contest will have major cross-strait implications. Some predict that the election of Vice President Lai Ching-te to succeed President Tsai Ing-wen (both are from the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, or DPP) will inflame cross-strait tensions and possibly precipitate a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Beijing already refuses to engage with the DPP, portraying Tsai as the leader of an illegitimate separatist faction controlled by the United States. Following her 2020 reelection, Tsai stated that even without a formal declaration, “we are an independent country already” and that younger Taiwanese are “pretty used to the idea that we have a separate identity, and we are a country of our own.” The Taiwanese people, practical and pluralistic, widely support preserving the status quo of neither unification nor formal independence. Lai, if elected, is unlikely to press the issue much further than Tsai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Taiwan’s unification-leaning opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party could further set back cross-strait relations. Driven off the Chinese mainland by the CCP in 1949, the KMT decamped to Taiwan as the Republic of China’s (ROC) government-in-exile and ruled the island under martial law for four decades. Taiwan transitioned to democracy in the 1990s, and the KMT conducted its first peaceful transfer of power to the DPP in 2000. The KMT returned to power in 2008 until Tsai’s 2016 election as president. To this day, Taiwan retains its ROC constitution and officially claims all of China’s territory as its own, even as each successive generation of Taiwanese people feels less connected to the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 2014 Sunflower Movement protesting the then-KMT government’s cross-strait economic engagement policies, the party has failed to address the waning popularity of its unification-leaning policy platform. While the KMT remains competitive in local elections, the party has not reckoned with its decisive losses in Taiwan’s 2016 and 2020 national elections. To appease its shrinking political base of waishengren (those who immigrated from the mainland to Taiwan around 1949) and its donor base of taishang (Taiwanese businesspeople whose fortunes are entwined with the mainland), the KMT continues to cling to the 1992 Consensus — an agreement whereby Beijing “respect[ed] and accept[ed]” (while disagreeing with) Taipei’s interpretation of One China as the Republic of China, headquartered in Taipei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1992, the cross-strait balance of power (economic, military, and diplomatic) has swung ominously in China’s favor, and Beijing’s position on the 1992 Consensus has shifted with it. Beijing no longer acknowledges “respective formulations of One China.” Instead, its One China principle now seeks to delegitimize Taiwan’s elected government in all fora worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True to the electorate, Tsai has not affirmed the 1992 Consensus — and Beijing has refused to engage Taipei in dialogue since 2016. As a result, the two sides of the strait have only grown further apart. Nonetheless, the KMT has persevered in maintaining the 1992 Consensus, arguing that it serves as a basis for cross-strait dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this cross-strait policy conundrum, the KMT must also reckon with widespread Taiwanese loathing of Beijing’s governance record, especially in Hong Kong. Since Hong Kong’s 1997 return to China from British colonial rule, Beijing has governed Hong Kong as a Special Administrative Region under its “One Country Two Systems” framework, originally proposed as a model for Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 2, 2019, Xi Jinping reiterated Beijing’s call for unification with Taiwan under this framework, based on its One China principle and the 1992 Consensus. But the Taiwanese people overwhelmingly reject the One Country Two Systems model and largely deny the 1992 Consensus, as reflected by the decisive 2020 DPP election victories. Hong Kong’s hastening loss of autonomy and civil liberties since then has only sharpened these sentiments in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the KMT faces a dilemma. A significant and growing majority of Taiwanese people do not want political union with the mainland — certainly not if imposed on them. Following its 2020 electoral defeat, the KMT rejected the One Country Two Systems framework but continues to assert the 1992 Consensus. As 2024 approaches, growing repression in Hong Kong and shifting demographics in Taiwan may finally convince the KMT to modify or relinquish the last planks of its unification platform. If not, the party risks falling into irrelevancy and Taiwan’s democracy risks losing its loyal opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beijings-one-china&quot;&gt;Beijing’s One China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the KMT chooses self-preservation and shifts its cross-strait policy platform to reflect Taiwan’s mainstream views, Xi Jinping will face his own dilemma. Beijing will find it difficult, if not impossible, to sustain its fictional narrative of a Taiwanese population yearning to rejoin the Chinese motherland. And if the KMT does not forsake the 1992 Consensus, its waning political relevance will similarly beset Beijing, albeit in chronic rather than acute fashion. A cross-strait policy formulation that can satisfy the needs of both the CCP and KMT may no longer exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For autocratic leaders such as Xi, perception is key to legitimacy. Without a credible pro-unification touchstone on Taiwan, Xi will feel more aggrieved and may abandon Beijing’s stated policy of peaceful unification, especially as he has argued that the Taiwan “problem” should not be passed down to future generations. Xi knows he cannot ignore the trends in Taiwan indefinitely; top CCP officials have begun signaling a possible Taiwan policy shift at the 2022 Party Congress, though details remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. One China policy has long held that a final resolution must be peaceful and according to the wishes of the people. In China’s version, however, “promoting peaceful unification while not giving up the use of force are like two sides of the same coin.” In other words, Beijing intends to use its growing military power to coerce a result to its own liking. As much as Beijing would prefer to avoid open conflict, Taiwanese popular sentiment increasingly shows the limits and often counterproductivity of China’s nonviolent approach, increasing the incentive to resort to more heavy-handed means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike with Hong Kong, Xi cannot effect control over Taiwan through quasi-legal maneuvers and co-option of law enforcement. However, Beijing could make its first move in an act of coercive lawfare by invoking its 2005 Anti-Secession Law, which states that when “possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted, the state shall employ non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Presumably, Xi would then accelerate and amplify his narrative case for the use of force, taking a page from Vladimir Putin’s playbook. But to succeed where Putin has failed, Xi needs a military that is up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following years of spending increases, technology assimilation, and organizational restructuring, the PLA is now expanding and refining its ability and capacity to project power through the increasing scale and sophistication of exercises on China’s periphery, including near Taiwan. PLA spokespersons and other CCP mouthpieces have likewise become more assertive in their diplomacy and rhetoric, often leveraging these offshore exercises for coercive signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most U.S. experts agree that China’s investments in military modernization over the past three decades have been transformative and that the PLA is “quickly approaching an invasion capability,” if not already there. Having personally ordered and overseen the acceleration of military reforms over the past decade, Xi is likely also gaining confidence in his forces — lowering his perceived risk of failure if he chooses to invade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s increasingly credible operational capability arguably represents the most fundamental change in the cross-strait dynamic in more than four decades. It imparts more leverage to Xi than his predecessors enjoyed — one of whom suffered the ignominy of failing to bend Taiwan to China’s political will during the 1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis. Beijing keenly understands that without a credible invasion threat, China cannot coerce Taiwan into submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;washingtons-one-china&quot;&gt;Washington’s One China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite China’s military reforms and buildup across the strait, Taipei and Washington neglected to maintain a credible military deterrence posture. Taipei resisted the necessary force structure changes to effectively counter the evolving PLA threat. And for two decades following the 1996 crisis, guided by academic advisers and intelligence analysts, U.S. policy on China reflected the United States’ post–Cold War overconfidence even as the cross-strait military balance steadily shifted in Beijing’s favor. China’s 2001 World Trade Organization accession and the September 11 attacks played significant roles as well, as Washington attempted to cultivate Beijing as a partner in globalization and counterterror. To this day, U.S. officials make overtures to cooperation, often overlooking the long-standing pattern of China’s transactional approach to foreign relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, Washington delayed and omitted hard security initiatives and other deterrence actions for Taiwan in pursuit of “constructive engagement” with Beijing. In hindsight, numerous U.S.-China dialogues led to Beijing’s deflections and underwhelming promises on human rights, intellectual property, industrial overcapacity, state subsidies, cyber theft, proliferation, counterterrorism, pollution, and militarization in the South China Sea. These agreements remain overwhelmingly unfulfilled or inconsequential to this day. U.S. engagement policies instead fueled rapid growth in China’s industrial and technology sectors, enabling PLA modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By favoring U.S.-China engagement over U.S.-Taiwan security cooperation for more than two decades, Washington mortgaged its own future security, falling ever deeper into a deterrence deficit. Perversely, “avoiding provocation” in past years has dramatically increased the likelihood and danger of major conflict today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2019, Washington and Taipei have belatedly initiated measures that will help make up lost ground. The United States is assisting Taiwan in the acquisition and fielding of combat-credible capabilities to counter a PLA assault, including large numbers of road-mobile anti-ship and shoulder-fired anti-air and anti-tank missiles. To be successful, Taiwan’s military leadership needs to commit to a realistic defense plan with sufficient survivable capabilities focused on denying, or at least delaying, a PLA lodgment (i.e., control of an air- or seaport enabling follow-on troops to flow into Taiwan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Perversely, “avoiding provocation” in past years has dramatically increased the likelihood and danger of major conflict today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to rectifying operational deficiencies, Washington has openly crossed some of Beijing’s long-perceived security-related redlines — with no direct consequences — including the permanent deployment of U.S. Marine Security Guards in Taipei, the export of advanced fighter jets and offensive weapons, and the revelation of U.S. special operators training counterparts in Taiwan. During the Trump administration, the vice president and cabinet secretaries routinely and openly voiced support for Taiwan and condemned China’s aggression — a practice that the Biden administration has sustained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, U.S. national security advisor Robert O’Brien declassified and released President Reagan’s 1982 Six Assurances to Taipei, effectively invalidating President Clinton’s 1998 Three No’s statement in Shanghai, an unreciprocated concession of the U.S.-China constructive engagement period. (While Kissinger had discussed the Three No’s in his first private bilateral discussions with Beijing in 1971, Clinton went further by articulating them as U.S. policy.) Biden invited Taiwan’s ambassador-equivalent to attend his inauguration ceremony and has explicitly kept the Six Assurances as a pillar of his One China Policy. Despite a long-standing policy of ambiguity regarding U.S. intervention, Biden has indicated at least three times that the United States is committed to militarily defending Taiwan, revealing his own instincts as commander in chief. (In all cases, U.S. officials later clarified that these did not indicate a policy change.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after assuming office, Biden opined that Xi “doesn’t have a democratic . . . bone in his body” and predicted “extreme [U.S.-China] competition.” Describing a global struggle between democracy and autocracy, Biden believes that the world is “in the midst of an historic and fundamental debate about [its] future direction.” Freedom House ranks Taiwan as Asia’s second-freest country and the seventh-freest in the world. By inviting Taiwan to participate in his December 2021 inaugural Summit for Democracy, Biden sent a signal to China and the world: the Taiwanese people must be allowed to choose their own path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same week, the top Indo-Pacific policy officials at the State and Defense Departments articulated the geostrategic case that Taiwan is “critical to the defense of vital U.S. interests” in recorded testimony to the U.S. Congress. Between the U.S. administration’s rhetoric and the CCP’s innate anxiety over “hostile Western forces,” Beijing views U.S. attempts to reassure as insincere. China’s ambassador to the United States, Qin Gang, expressed this plainly (while misstating the U.S. position and other historical facts) in a May 2022 editorial published the same day U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken asserted that Beijing’s “words and actions are deeply destabilizing” and “threaten the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very next day, in his remarks commissioning new U.S. military officers, Biden relayed what Xi had said on a call: “Democracies cannot be sustained in the 21st century. Autocracies will run the world.” Biden told the U.S. officers flatly that Xi was wrong and they would be the “representatives and defenders of our democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;comprehensive-deterrence&quot;&gt;Comprehensive Deterrence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2022, Qin warned “if the Taiwanese authorities, emboldened by the United States, keep going down the road for independence, it most likely will involve China and the United States, the two big countries, in a military conflict.” Two weeks later, in its updated Indo-Pacific Strategy, the White House responded by committing “to ensure an environment in which Taiwan’s future is determined peacefully in accordance with the wishes and best interests of Taiwan’s people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barring a major policy shift in one of the three capitals, their respective policies and politics are crowding out mutually acceptable alternatives or concessions — potentially leaving open only one path to resolution for Beijing: the use of force. Washington would be wise to accept that an autocratic China is firmly committed to annexing a democratic Taiwan. The United States and its allies should shift away from a hedging strategy, which often compromises deterrence to preserve political space for a quixotic negotiated resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the United States should lead allies in adopting a comprehensive deterrence strategy. In addition to urgently fielding relevant military capabilities to increase Beijing’s perceived risk, Washington and its allies should also take steps to raise Beijing’s perceived costs — expecting and accepting that such steps might engender diplomatic tantrums, saber rattling, and other forms of retaliation and brinksmanship from Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the recent U.S. overtures related to Taiwan’s security, the response among allies has been positive. In 2020, following approvals for $12 billion in U.S. arms sales to Taiwan by the Trump administration, a French firm signed a contract to upgrade Taiwan’s 30-year-old Lafayette frigates, despite a 1994 Sino-French agreement that had halted French security assistance to Taiwan. In 2021 and again in 2022, U.S. leader and minister level joint statements with Japan, Korea, and the G7 called for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait — occasioning rote complaints from Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Washington and its allies should also take steps to raise Beijing’s perceived costs — expecting and accepting that such steps might engender diplomatic tantrums, saber rattling, and other forms of retaliation and brinksmanship from Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2021, Japan’s deputy prime minister said the quiet part out loud: that Japan would join the United States in defending Taiwan in a contingency. And then in October, the UK defense minister warned China to cease its destabilizing and provocative military activities toward Taiwan. The following month, Australia’s defense minister indicated that Canberra would also join a U.S.-led coalition to defend Taiwan in a conflict. These allied expressions of solidarity elicited predictable rebukes from China’s messaging apparatus — precisely because they enhance cross-strait deterrence by forcing Beijing to consider greater risks and costs for its potential aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During her January 2022 confirmation hearing, U.S. assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs Celeste Wallander told Congress that the U.S. response to Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea “was too slow and too incremental. And it’s confirmed by the lessons that I learned, and that I believe others in the national security community learned.” The editorial board of the Washington Post put it more succinctly, saying “when past U.S. policy has failed in Ukraine, it was often because, fearing to provoke Mr. Putin, it did not do enough to deter him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stronger signals of U.S. and allied resolve earlier arguably could have prevented initiation of the security dilemma that culminated in open warfare in Ukraine. Having underestimated the West’s determination, Putin found himself having to choose between preserving either his own political legitimacy or Russia’s economic well-being — he predictably chose the former. Given the stakes of a Taiwan Strait scenario, the United States and its allies need to present unambiguous deterrence signals to Xi before he sets similar irreversible wheels into motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to accelerating military capability enhancements in Taiwan and the region, the administration should take near-term steps to implement Biden’s foreign policy doctrine in regards to the Taiwan Strait. Washington needs to demonstrate that democracies can defend themselves against a rising tide of authoritarianism. Firm U.S. leadership will encourage allies to recognize the stakes and join in deterring or responding to cross-strait aggression. Below are four immediate opportunities to signal resolve to Beijing, Taipei, and key allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The U.S. State Department should amend its day-to-day policy articulation to match President Biden’s rhetoric and strategic guidance. During the U.S.-China engagement era, American diplomats and spokespersons were trained to defuse Beijing’s rhetorical challenges using staid non-answers (e.g., “we are committed to our One China Policy based on . . .”). In an era of competition, the United States need not appease and should not surrender the narrative.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington should turn the tables and actively demand that Beijing return to its “fundamental policy to strive for a peaceful solution” as agreed in the final U.S.-China Joint Communique in 1982. Both privately and publicly, U.S. officials should press Beijing to demonstrate sincerity by abandoning its Anti-Secession Law and reorienting PLA missiles and other offensive forces away from Taiwan. When China fails to heed these calls, U.S. allies and partners would then absorb and possibly even amplify the message that Beijing created this powder keg, not Washington. This in turn would make it more difficult for Xi to justify Chinese aggression to the world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;China repeats Russia’s narrative that the United States caused and perpetuates the war in Ukraine by expanding NATO and arming Nazis. Sowing seeds of justification for future aggression, Beijing explicitly connects NATO expansion to maturing U.S. partnerships in the Indo-Pacific. Xi parrots Putin’s zero-sum concept of “indivisible security” to preemptively shift the blame for Beijing’s own violent plans. Washington cannot afford to cede ground in the “discourse power” contest that will assign responsibility for conflict in the eyes of the world. Just as the United States concluded that it must “shape the strategic environment around Beijing,” rather than changing China through engagement, one of China’s principal goals in engaging the United States and others in high-level diplomacy is to bend regional and global narratives in its favor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The U.S. military should normalize public messaging regarding U.S.-Taiwan defense cooperation, which takes place under the auspices of the nongovernmental American Institute in Taiwan. Between 2018 and 2019, the Taiwanese armed forces hosted more than 250 U.S. delegations involving thousands of personnel. Beijing, with its extensive intelligence networks, is well aware of these activities — but the broader public, inside and outside of China, remains largely in the dark. This is a missed opportunity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition to building partner capacity, U.S. military engagement aims to deter adversaries and reassure allies. The United States actively promotes island defense training engagements with Japan and the Philippines, two of Taiwan’s neighbors who have territorial disputes with China. The U.S. Defense Department publicizes its defensive cyber cooperation with partners such as Estonia and Lithuania, who, like Taiwan, face continuous state-sponsored cyberattacks from a threatening neighbor. In the case of Taiwan, however, the United States routinely bypasses such opportunities for messaging deterrence and reassurance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pro-China media in Taiwan often accuse Washington of unloading second-rate weapons on Taiwan at inflated prices. As Beijing tells it, the United States is “stirring up trouble” to line its own pockets. Despite a U.S. legal obligation under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide both equipment and training (“defense articles and services”) proportional to the threat, the Defense Department remains hesitant to promote or even acknowledge its numerous U.S.-funded military exchanges with Taiwan. Public reporting of these activities would blunt anti-U.S. narratives in the region and raise Taiwanese confidence and will to fight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington reportedly chastised Tsai for publicly confirming the presence of U.S. military trainers in Taiwan. But Tsai’s honest response to a direct question may have contributed favorably to the Australian defense minister remarking only two weeks later that “it would be inconceivable that we [Australia] wouldn’t support the U.S. in an action” to defend Taiwan. Washington’s instinct to obscure security cooperation with Taiwan is a relic of a lead-from-behind hedging strategy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Washington’s instinct to obscure security cooperation with Taiwan is a relic of a lead-from-behind hedging strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under a competitive strategy, the United States should prioritize collective deterrence messaging above sensitivity to Beijing’s narrative preferences. There should be neither shame nor fear in building Taiwan’s capacity to deter or deny an attack — a mission that serves U.S. and allied vital interests. As it does with other U.S. agencies’ activities, the American Institute in Taiwan should promote military-to-military interactions through statements, press conferences, websites, and social media. With more assertive U.S. leadership on security cooperation with Taiwan, close allies would also increase cooperation themselves, further weighing on Beijing’s calculus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biden should explicitly grant his top aides the authorities needed to sever or disrupt China’s technology and energy supplies. Just as the United States maintains a honed military force to promote peace and stability, it should also sharpen its economic tools of deterrence — before the advent of hot conflict, not after, as with Ukraine. In June 2021, Biden broadened the treasury secretary’s authority to restrict U.S. portfolio investment in China’s military-industrial complex to cover surveillance technology companies contributing to human rights violations. Given the potential threat to global stability and prosperity, Biden should preemptively expand these powers to levy full blocking sanctions against people and organizations that contribute to cross-strait aggression. He should also grant his State and Homeland Security Departments the authority to designate and block U.S. entry of such individuals and their family members.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leading by example, the administration should encourage allies to preemptively develop the legal authorities to impose similar sanctions in response to Chinese aggression. Taken together, these formalized policies would constitute appropriate and proportional responses to Beijing’s Anti-Secession Law and other forms of coercion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biden and Congress should ensure that appropriate authorities exist to counter China across the spectrum of conflict. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, the president is obligated to consult with Congress on a response to “any threat to the security or the social or economic system” of Taiwan. One could argue that threshold has already been met. Regardless of whether the act is formally invoked, the executive branch should have mechanisms in place for immediate crisis response short of armed conflict, including options for covert and clandestine operations in the space, cyber, and undersea domains. No new actions need be taken unless and until Beijing chooses to act out. But explicitly articulating and delegating these authorities now would necessarily weigh on Xi’s cost-benefit analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was first articulated, the One China compromise allowed Washington and Beijing to shelve the question of Taiwan sovereignty and focus on the common threat emanating from Moscow. After 1991, this truce was extended as the United States and China found new common causes. More recently, divergent views on the benefits of globalization and goals of counterterrorism have emerged on either side of the Pacific, and global developments have exposed the impotence of U.S.-China engagement on issues from health security and non-proliferation to climate change and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having witnessed the enduring trends of a growing Taiwanese democratic self-identity, a rapidly improving PLA, and a hardening of China’s autocracy, Washington and the free world need to acknowledge that the status quo is unstable, if not unsustainable. Over more than 70 years, the regime in Beijing, abetted by U.S. and global passivity, has become more dogmatic about subjugating Taiwan — no amount of affirmative U.S. engagement has or will alter this catechism. As China attains the military capability to effect a forceful takeover of Taiwan, the United States should instead employ all measures to dissuade a cross-strait conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, U.S. hesitation to arm Ukraine and the lifting of sanctions on Nord Stream 2 sent the exact wrong signals to Putin, leading him to underestimate U.S. and allied resolve. A similar strategic miscue toward Xi could be catastrophic. In addition to mass casualties and displacements within Taiwan, a large-scale cross-strait conflict would induce a major global economic downturn and associated humanitarian crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the opening of his March 2022 State of Union address, President Biden reflected, “Throughout our history, we’ve learned this lesson: When dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos, they keep moving. And the costs, the threats to America and to the world keep rising. . . . American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.” Speaking a week after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Biden was lamenting that the world had just relearned the lesson. Washington and its allies need to clearly demonstrate their resolve to avoid repeating the lesson yet again in the Taiwan Strait. In addition to urgently fielding effective military capabilities, the United States should strengthen and multilateralize credible strategic signals to comprehensively deter Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The federal government’s latest guidance aimed at improving the nation’s cybersecurity demonstrates a commendable shift in priorities — moving away from perimeter defense and firewalls and instead embracing zero trust architecture (ZTA) to create resilient systems. For the government to succeed in this transition, it must recognize that ZTA is more about mindset and culture than it is a standardized roadmap.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;The government should act with urgency to adopt this mindset and specific plans for implementation, even while emphasizing that implementation will be an ongoing process over several years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent nation-state cyber operations targeting U.S. federal government information systems, including the 2020 SolarWinds supply chain compromise, are motivating ambitious efforts across the executive and legislative branches to create resilient information systems and modernize federal cybersecurity. U.S. cybersecurity leaders are pursuing these modernization efforts across several lines of effort, with the White House issuing multiple executive orders, the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) issuing new standards and guidance, and Congress evaluating major revisions to the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uniting these diverse initiatives is the emerging consensus that resilience is best achieved by a “zero trust” approach to cybersecurity. Above all else, zero trust, or zero trust architecture (ZTA), should be considered a security design philosophy — rather than a specific suite of technologies — that reflects a security approach of “never trust, always verify.” This approach stands in sharp contrast with traditional information technology (IT) network designs that rely heavily on trusting devices connected to a network and only verifying identity once. Endpoint security, which CrowdStrike defines as “preventing, detecting and remediating cyberattacks for any device, whether it is connected to a traditional network or in the cloud,” is a key element of ZTA. The endpoint security net extends to a large number of devices, geographic regions and network types,” including laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The scale and complexity of the endpoint security challenge is rapidly transforming the types of tools necessary to secure an organization’s endpoints. Increased mobility, along with Bring Your Own Device policies, and the increased adoption of IoT reflect an endpoint security mission that has rapidly surpassed traditional approaches, such as deploying anti-virus software on physical workstations. Going forward, organizations will need to integrate a diverse array of endpoint security components into their broader ZTA strategies. As Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) director Jen Easterly recently argued, adopting zero trust “really is a journey,” and identifying and implementing the right suite of measures will be a major challenge for many federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assist the U.S. federal government’s efforts to improve its cyber defenses, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) undertook a six-month research project focused on examining federal zero trust implementation. Working from CISA’s existing Zero Trust Maturity Model guidance, CSIS focused its analysis on whether zero trust is the right answer for the federal government and, having established the benefits of this approach, what obstacles exist to implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers focused on two key elements of zero trust: devices and identity. Although ZTA principles need to extend to every aspect of an agency’s enterprise, zero trust fundamentally begins with knowing what devices are connecting to agency resources, verifying who is using them, and then having the right policies and technologies in place to properly govern access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS interviewed cybersecurity experts from across industry and government and convened a structured workshop to answer five key questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is ZTA the right approach for improving federal cybersecurity?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can the federal government implement ZTA and endpoint security across its networks?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What acquisition and security approaches are either contributing to or undermining efforts to integrate zero trust into federal networks?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How should recent sophisticated cyber incidents influence decisionmaking on zero trust and endpoint security implementation?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How have efforts to improve workforce mobility, made acute by the Covid-19 pandemic, accelerated or impeded implementation of ZTA and endpoint security?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief delivers the CSIS research team’s findings across four sections. It begins with a brief summary explaining the concept of zero trust and why it is imperative for modern enterprise security, including for the federal government. It then identifies several of the key barriers that are currently impeding federal government ZTA adoption efforts. The final two sections highlight enabling factors, recommendations, and next steps agencies, departments, and Congress can take as they build out their ZTA plans. The findings in this report are informed by interviews with cybersecurity experts (Appendix A) and independent research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no single path to success in designing and implementing an enterprise architecture that is built on zero trust principles. While there will be many similar steps along the zero trust journey for all federal departments and agencies, their diverse missions, security requirements, and existing architectures — more than anything else — require approaches that are agile and adaptable across a wide range of use cases. Fundamentally, federal agencies and departments must make space in budgets for procurement and training, and Congress must consistently fund agency-specific cybersecurity enhancement plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is no single path to success in designing and implementing an enterprise architecture that is built on zero trust principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;storming-the-castle-why-zero-trust&quot;&gt;Storming the Castle: Why Zero Trust?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zero trust is often characterized as an alternative to legacy “perimeter-based” cybersecurity. For decades, enterprise cybersecurity efforts have revolved around the concept of “implicit trust.” Under this model, networks and systems were designed to defend against intrusions at a well-defined network perimeter. Imagine this perimeter as a medieval castle. The castle is surrounded by a moat and 40-foot-high stone walls. Access is granted only via a single gate, where guards scrutinize and verify the identity of each visitor. However, once admitted, one can move about freely. Some areas inside the castle are locked and guarded, but most are not. There is little scrutiny once someone is within the walls because their very presence means they have been vetted. They are implicitly trusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if someone is not whom they claim to be? What if they are an assassin disguised as a guard? What if they are secretly working for a rival kingdom and intent on theft and sabotage? Credential harvesting remains a popular entry point for malicious cyber actors. In a perimeter-based environment, those bad actors — once they gain initial access to a network — could potentially operate unconstrained within the walls. In 2010, Forrester analyst John Kindervag described how cybersecurity efforts that emphasized perimeter defense exposed organizations to a range of external and insider threats. In the process, he set forth the broad contours of ZTA. From the outset, the term zero trust meant that no activity, regardless of whether it originated inside the network or outside of its perimeter, should be assumed to be trustworthy. In terms of the medieval castle, this would mean increasing security inside the walls, such as by locking and guarding more doors and requiring visitors to repeatedly verify their identity as they move about the castle grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enterprises themselves have grown more complex. Organizations now effectively lack perimeters. Systems are increasingly migrating to commercial clouds, and organizations operate hybrid infrastructures where some resources remain on legacy data centers while others move to commercial clouds. As noted, the rapid pivot to telework and an increasingly mobile workforce are greatly complicating enterprise security planning, as a proliferating number of devices access agency resources. Moreover, organizations such as the Departments of Defense, State, and Justice and elements of the intelligence community continue to operate multiple networks, often geographically dispersed across the United States and the globe. The long-term incentive for ZTA is that it provides opportunities for vertical and horizontal scalability which will lead to cost savings and increased security over time. The progression from the high castle perimeter to a segmented, guarded ZTA is a continuum, involving many small measures that each contribute to a resilient, protected system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;barriers-to-implementation&quot;&gt;Barriers to Implementation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shifting from perimeter defense to ZTA is not as easy as flipping a switch; it is a complex undertaking. Further, it involves more than procuring new hardware and software. Making such a shift requires adopting new policies, processes, and structures. Executive Order (EO) 14028 directs the federal government to implement ZTA, but a number of budgetary and cultural hurdles could delay or prevent the widespread adoption of supporting policies and technologies. The following categories are key areas where agencies and departments might struggle in their respective attempts to design and implement a robust ZTA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Shifting from perimeter defense to ZTA is not as easy as flipping a switch; it is a complex undertaking. Further, it involves more than procuring new hardware and software. Making such a shift requires adopting new policies, processes, and structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget and Acquisition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requirements outlined in EO 14028 represent potentially significant changes in the software acquisition space. EO 14028 lays out several actions that will shape acquisitions, including revised contract language requiring companies doing business with the government to share information about cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/220616_Table_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Requirements Outlined in Executive Order (EO) 14028&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EO’s suggested changes represent a significant increase in data collection and preservation. These data-sharing requirements are often unpopular within industry because they are viewed as burdensome and may reveal vulnerabilities that commercial companies do not want to share with the government or of which the companies themselves are often unaware. These are necessary steps in moving toward ZTA, but government needs to anticipate and create policies and legislation to further mitigate these concerns and incentivize sharing. The EO requires the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to review the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement within 60 days, in consultation with the secretary of defense, attorney general, secretary of homeland security, and director of national intelligence, with recommendations posted for public comment within 90 days of that review. The Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and NASA opened public comment periods for Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which closed in April 2022. As of May 2022, Defense Acquisition Regulatory Council staff were drafting the proposed rule. In concert, CISA’s Applying Zero Trust Principles to Enterprise Mobility, released in March 2022, called for “a tighter integration between [Enterprise Mobility Management] EMM and mobile threat defense and enterprise logging, monitoring, diagnostics, and mitigation systems is needed towards meeting [zero trust] ZT requirements of the May 2021 Executive Order 14028.” That included a draft Zero Trust Maturity Model, which was likewise open for public comment until April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cover the costs of ZTA, the FY 2023 budget provides an additional $486 million to CISA, bringing its total funding to $2.5 billion, a portion of which will support the transition to ZTA. The Department of the Treasury’s Cybersecurity Enhancement Account demonstrates the priority put on the move to ZTA, allocating over $86 million of its $215 million in program increases — including 9 of its 21 proposed additional full-time equivalent staff — to the effort. Investments such as these point to ZTA as both a budget priority and long-term project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the specifics are still under development, EO 14028 calls for a substantial increase in security and resilience measures that, when implemented, should mitigate the damage during a breach. Implementing those measures will require new polices, processes, and IT architectures, which each agency and department must adapt to its needs. The full cost of transitioning to ZTA remains unknown, although over the long term, the benefits from ZTA, in the form of improved security and productivity, as well as the costs of not moving in this direction, will be substantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech Debt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migrating an entire enterprise to ZTA is, invariably, an incremental process. A key consideration in migration is the need to manage legacy — often outdated — devices, systems, and architecture. Managing risk from this “technology debt” is a significant challenge for federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. federal government spends approximately $90 billion annually on IT. However, according to analysis by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the GSA, and members of Congress, much of this funding is dedicated toward maintaining legacy, often antiquated systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to one expert interviewed in support of this report, departments and agencies often find it challenging to secure funding and authorization for new large-scale IT modernization efforts and relatively easier to obtain funding for existing systems. This dynamic often motivates agencies to focus on operating and maintaining existing systems rather than pursuing new capital investments. Over time, these forces have contributed to the federal government’s current level of technology debt. As a result, federal cybersecurity officials find themselves responsible for maintaining legacy, often mission-critical systems while trying to ensure that these systems do not become key weaknesses in the organization’s overall security posture. The federal government has, unfortunately, already vividly demonstrated how compounding technology debt can leave systems vulnerable to compromise. Despite the substantial privacy and national security implications of the compromise in June 2015 of personnel data and background investigation information at the Office of Personnel Management, more than six years later the agency was still struggling to implement wide-ranging enterprise security modernization initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to funding and planning challenges, efforts to manage legacy systems can present a dilemma between user experience and security. Pursuing a seamless user experience, developers may integrate access to legacy services into newer capabilities. However, such an approach means that the new system could inherit any vulnerabilities present in the legacy service. In many circumstances, effective risk mitigation while migrating to ZTA may require federal agencies to consider temporarily degrading user experience in the broader interest of security. For example, adhering to the fundamental ZTA principle of “limiting the blast radius” of any successful breach requires agencies to segment their networks, particularly legacy systems and operational technology (OT). While such segmentation inevitably creates some friction for users by restricting their ability to move around the network, access certain data across the network, or escalate permissions, failing to close this vulnerability presents a greater risk. Further, implementing many ZTA authentication technologies ultimately can move segmentation into the background and allow the user experience to appear seamless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this process, communication with affected users needs to be an ongoing priority. Most importantly, users must understand that measures to wall off legacy systems from the rest of the enterprise are a necessary, temporary inconvenience to maintain the broader integrity of the organization’s IT systems. Such measures should be accompanied by a clear roadmap for modernizing the underlying technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Urgency and Behavioral Friction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the roundtable discussion, participants agreed that agency leaders recognize that moving to ZTA is important. This conclusion is consistent with a recent Cyberscoop and Fedscoop report that surveyed agency leaders and IT experts across the federal government in December 2021. When asked to evaluate the impact of EO 14028 in “getting agency leaders to commit resources to critical cybersecurity projects,” 86 percent of civilian agency respondents, 81 percent of defense agency respondents, and 64 percent of intelligence community respondents either agreed that it was “game-changing” or “greatly needed.” However, a number of the CSIS roundtable participants also agreed that the conceptual acceptance of ZTA or the value placed on the EO has not translated into a commensurate sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lack of urgency, expressed by the highest levels of the departments and agencies, could lead to superficial “box-checking” compliance in the near term — minimal exerted effort to meet the basic requirements of compliance — when what is needed are investments in comprehensive and dynamic plans that can be adapted over time. Though further investigation is required to fully assess the quality of agencies’ newly proposed ZTA designs and implementation plans, that same Cyberscoop survey also polled respondents on the following question: “How much progress has your agency made to date (as of December 2021) with building strategies around the EO?” Among respondents, 15 percent stated that roughly half of the strategies required have been developed. A staggering 43 percent believed roughly three-quarters of the required strategies have been implemented, and another 33 percent believed all the strategies required have been developed. The discrepancy between experts interviewed by CSIS and the survey responses from current agency leads and IT experts might indicate that some of the agencies are currently operating on a sense of complacency that enough has been done to satisfy the EO and, by extension, increase overall security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, behavioral friction can further thwart incentives for agency leaders to develop a greater sense of urgency and aggressively adopt more security policies that align with ZTA mindset. At the rank-and-file level, moving control frameworks closer to the user and device means establishing security procedures that add steps or require a change in habits. While security imperatives should outweigh ease of use, it can be difficult to push out these new processes to the larger workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unclear Policies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Misalignment between agency policies and OMB guidance can also cause confusion and unclear paths to ZTA implementation. For example, one of the roundtable participants noted that typical budget review and approval processes are not structured in a way to meet EO 14028’s ambitious FY 2024 deadline — budget cycles take years to catch up with new spending mandates. The budget process disincentivizes large-scale, long-term changes. Timelines are a good forcing mechanism, but short timelines with limited guidance could create budget issues for agencies that are having a difficult time prioritizing efforts in this space. It is still too early to determine how many agencies met the OMB’s initial reporting deadlines outlined in EO 14028 and how many either took advantage of the waiver exception or missed the deadline altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, one interviewee noted that while each standalone policy might be important, the disparate policies do not help create coherent strategy when taken together. Coordinating offices — especially the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) — are best placed to identify these disconnects and issue clarifying guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership and Accountability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several interviewees noted that much of ZTA implementation relies on access to resources and high-level buy-in from agency leadership. Looking across the government, interviewees reported confusion about who is leading strategic coordination. OMB has the most clearly defined role, but CISA, the National Security Agency (NSA), and ONCD all provide guidance and play a larger role in actively managing progress across federal networks. Without clearly delineated roles at the coordination level, it can be difficult for cabinet secretaries and department heads to know whose guidelines should take priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/220616_Figure_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: ZTA Management&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While OMB has the current lead to help agencies prioritize initiatives during their ZTA migrations, it lacks sufficient staff and expertise to ensure implementation on its own. Other entities, such as ONCD, might have greater cyber expertise to both monitor and build out long-term plans with the agencies and departments. Budget oversight and review is key and is currently a joint effort led by OMB and supported by ONCD. It is important to note that this system of cooperation is most formally and visibly represented by the dual-hatted OMB federal chief information security officer (CISO)/deputy national cyber director position. However, the current arrangement potentially puts too much pressure on OMB. Instead, an existing department or office with a cybersecurity mandate should take the lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the agency or department level, an added barrier is identifying which individual or office should be in charge of monitoring the ZTA migration progress. Though the specific role will vary depending on the agency, roundtable participants and a few interviewees alike emphasized that federal CISOs, though likely candidates to oversee ZTA developments, should not be in charge of this effort unless given greater authorities. Effective ZTA implementation requires oversight and control over relevant parts of the agency’s budget review and allocation process, authority to change security policies across the agency to make sure they align with ZTA principles, and the ability to sufficiently prioritize cybersecurity modernization when faced with other competing priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, beyond any confusion about who is in charge, there are questions about what these tasked individuals or offices are being held accountable for. The federal guidance is intentionally vague to provide flexibility to the agencies and departments on their ZTA journeys, but that also means there are no standard metrics to assess progress. One expert pointed out that it is extremely clear what failure or negligence looks like when it comes to physical security. It is less clear in the cyber domain, making it difficult to design agreed-upon standards by which to grade success or failure. A lack of clear expectations and a faltering sense of urgency is a recipe for complacency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perception Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extending beyond the aforementioned challenges, a number of the experts noted that ZTA has a perception issue. The term itself has been around for some time, and to varying degrees, ZTA can still be seen as an overwhelming, costly, or time-intensive marketing gimmick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, much of the federal government, particularly national security agencies and departments, have been in the practice of adopting technologies and processes that, while currently insufficient, are foundational and compatible with zero trust frameworks. For example, one of the interviewed experts noted that even though industry is often touted as being ahead of government when it comes to designing ZTA, departments such as DOD are ahead of the private sector with regard to how data is classified, rationalized, accessed, and stored in a precisely segmented fashion. The more highly classified the data, the less trust is assumed or allowed in accessing this data, with more preventive controls based upon user identity, verification, and authentication mechanisms, enforced across physical and logical control planes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the roundtable experts remarked, ZTA works well when the “mission advantage” is well understood and clearly articulated. It is the same question that the private sector has to address — beyond security, how can implementing ZTA principles be framed as benefitting the bottom line?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, much of the federal government, particularly national security agencies and departments, have been in the practice of adopting technologies and processes that, while currently insufficient, are foundational and compatible with zero trust frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers identified the following seven initiatives that should be near-term priorities for government efforts to implement ZTA:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/220616_Figure_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Near-Term Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the near-term priorities list, the CSIS research team identified the following additional recommendations that warrant consideration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agencies and Departments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engage in network penetration exercises. The federal government should develop a cultural acceptance — even encouragement — of frequent penetration testing. Agency heads can encourage this mindset by acknowledging that security is never perfect and that a penetration test that finds nothing is a failed penetration test. Penetration testing and policies around asset management should go hand-in-hand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Map system dependencies when doing asset management. It is important to not just be aware of what devices are connected on your network but how those individual devices interact with each other. By maintaining an accurate asset inventory, identifying critical assets, and factoring in dependencies between different devices in an enterprise’s network, an organization can be better positioned to make informed decisions regarding budgets, resource allocation, and acquisitions. Additionally, clearly mapping out system dependencies can help agencies understand potential cascading consequences and identify “single points of failure” or other key nodes. This in turn will help them better understand and prepare for a variety of malicious activity and can help agencies better anticipate complications as they attempt to replace all or parts of legacy systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Set priorities that are “contextually dependent.” Agencies and departments will have different contextual backgrounds that need to be considered when setting priorities. Different sectors of the federal government will be embarking on their migration efforts at different starting maturity levels, and the OMB’s zero trust strategy accounts for that. Agencies and departments are expected to all be moving in the same general direction but should set priorities that account for their current cybersecurity posture, agency mission and culture, leadership buy-in, and the overall working relationship of an agency or department with Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transition from vulnerable multifactor authentication (MFA) systems to more secure authentication mechanisms within the next few years. In addition to updating actual MFA policies and applications as needed, departments should gradually move toward even more secure authentication apps and processes, such as FIDO authentication. FIDO login credentials do away with usernames and passwords and instead rely on passkeys that are generated by a user during their first interaction with a device or website (e.g., biometric sensors). The passkey can then be automatically applied anytime the individual uses the device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designate deputy secretaries as the lead for ZTA implementation; however, agency heads are ultimately responsible for cybersecurity. The deputy secretary level is well placed to manage the internal processes necessary for the transition and also to remove roadblocks to implementation. Consistent, focused attention at the deputy secretary level will speed the transition. The buck still stops with agency heads, however, in particular when explaining progress (or a lack thereof) to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Demonstrate the mission value of migration to ZTA. Leaders should emphasize business and mission advantage to drive digital transformation. Doing so will incentivize key actors by providing a sense of direct benefits to their respective organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inform workflows with threat intelligence. User authentication should be informed by threat intelligence and enhanced by processes that enable continuous data enrichment, analysis, and correlation. Agencies and departments should evaluate methods for automating these processes using machine learning and other data analysis tools that can measure the quality and trust of the underlying threat data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enable Data Orchestration. ZTA implementation will require interaction of multiple technologies for user authentication at every level. If handled manually, this level of effort is unscalable. Agencies and departments should eliminate inefficiency and visibility gaps stemming from manual execution of tasks; instead, they should create an orchestration layer that is not bound to any one technology but underlies the entire ZTA architecture and engages with all tools.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expand and streamline modernization and working capital funds. Initiatives such as the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) and IT Working Capital Funds, both of which were enacted in 2017, have created new authorities and funding vehicles that agencies can utilize to accelerate their technology modernization efforts. Congress should annually or biannually set up a formal review of the programs, particularly the TMF, to ensure the funds are being appropriately and consistently funded year after year to meet broader federal cybersecurity needs. Congress should also consider establishing an “agility fund,” where agencies with urgent needs are able to quickly receive support funds if issues arise during their ZTA migration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conduct a formal review of the OMB and ONCD’s efforts to assist with overall ZTA plans. To ensure that the OMB, ONCD, and other agencies tasked with coordination are making necessary progress, Congress should better assert its oversight authority and closely monitor government-wide compliance with EO 14028. Different agencies will have varying levels of understanding of the importance of embracing ZTA. Congress must remind these agencies what is required of them in this endeavor. This emphasis is particularly important for independent agencies, as the Executive Office of the President will have extremely limited authority. Since ZTA migration is a multiyear effort, the CSIS team recommends a biannual review starting in 2024. Authority in Congress for this review is dispersed, as each agency or department reports to its own oversight committee, but the Homeland Security Committee is best placed to be a central oversight mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhance transparency of ZTA implementation progress. Federal government leaders should commit to transparently documenting and sharing lessons learned with other agency leads and Congress during the ZTA journey to “foster a culture of continuous improvement” and learning among agencies and departments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take a hard look at congressional systems. Congress is not immune from attacks, nor should it postpone a ZTA effort of its own. Congressional leaders should be asking hard questions of its own security measures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CISA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clarify role and authority. CISA is situated as a leader in the civilian federal zero trust journey, but its role in ZTA implementation is relatively unclear. There is a need to clarify the boundaries of CISA’s role and what authorities it has in enabling, managing, and assessing the progress of ZTA implementation at other departments and agencies. CISA is poised to play the role of ZTA enabler, yet clearer authorities would address the remaining loopholes and aid it in its ability to surge support to agencies along their ZTA journey. As recommended by interviewed experts and in a recent report from the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC), CISA should be a knowledge management center of excellence for ZTA for the civilian government, providing resources to further aid agencies, such as implementation guidance, reference architectures, capability catalogs, and training modules. Additionally, given the role and mission of CISA, it would be an ideal agency to implement a centralized model to surge support in implementation, tools, training, and teams to help with the adoption of ZTA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conduct studies with outside labs and research institutions to assess where ZTA migration disruptions might occur and how to best mitigate their impact. There will inevitably be some disruptions in the process of migrating to ZTA. However, repeated disruptions could kill willingness to move forward. CISA should not only pre-emptively identify where those disruptions might take place but also ways to mitigate issues that may arise. This is especially important when considering OT disruptions. OT is often controlling activity where disruption could have a significant impact. Failure to consider the unique requirements and challenges in the OT context could further stymie plans to transition to ZTA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ONCD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clarify roles and authorities (especially in relation to ONCD, OMB, and CISA). There is an opportunity for the ONCD to play a more visible role in processes related to high-level coordination, budget review, and information sharing as it relates to ZTA. For example, ONCD should draft the strategy and ensure coherence in its implementation, including overseeing budgets for ZTA. OMB has a potential “hammer” to ensure appropriate action is being taken, but ONCD will have deeper expertise to inform those decisions, analyze and assess progress, bring greater coherence to relevant budgets across departments and agencies, drive necessary decisions, and deconflict demands for resources. More clearly defining ONCD’s role as the overall lead for ZTA will also help more clearly define the boundaries of the authorities of the other agencies managing ZTA implementation vis-à-vis the ONCD and will help CISA stand apart as the more operational lead that can provide tools and expertise to help departments and agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create metrics to measure ZTA implementation successes. The NSTAC report recommended that federal CISOs, in coordination with ONCD, “establish or enhance the existing metric-based requirements tied to industry best practices for [ZTA] implementation with reporting accountability at the agency CISO-level or above.” The CSIS team recommends that interagency reporting accountability should be at the deputy secretary level. This will work best if CISOs and chief information officerss are given stronger authorities to sufficiently support agency and department-wide ZTA implementation. Agencies and departments should implement this approach, learning from industry successes and failures in this space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prioritize aligning policies both across the U.S. government and within each department and agency. Misaligned policies at any level could delay ZTA implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;long-term-enablers-for-implementation&quot;&gt;Long-term Enablers for Implementation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zero trust and a focus on endpoint security are necessary prerequisites to increasing overall security; however, to fully support a commitment to ZTA principles and grow institutional resilience, a number of the interviewed experts underscored that the federal government needs to have long-term plans to ensure both consistent funding streams and a fully staffed, properly skilled workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber threats to the U.S. government will only continue to grow over the next few years, whether from the expansion of nation-state cyber programs, existing adversaries upgrading their capabilities, or new technologies creating additional vulnerabilities. As a result, the federal government’s new zero trust strategy will have to be bolstered by funding to enable effective cyber defenses. On cybersecurity-related spending, the administration requested $10.9 billion for FY 2023, with an eye on funding a strategic shift in defending federal infrastructure and service delivery. In total, the administration seeks $65 billion for IT at civilian agencies, covering 4,290 investments at 24 agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS’s interviewees corroborated that, so far, funding processes have been a hindrance rather than an advantage in adopting new strategies for securing critical infrastructure. Furthermore, the current budgeting process and implementation strategies are not yet aligned with the government’s commitment to instituting a new ZTA strategy. Achieving full-scale federal cybersecurity and implementing endpoint detection and response (EDR) through ZTA will require the federal government to make difficult budgetary decisions and prioritize funding streams in favor of ZTA policies over other standard IT protocols at almost every stage of cybersecurity, including software and hardware acquisition, migration processes, and training in cybersecurity and digital technologies, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To facilitate funding requests and allocation processes, the government must devise distribution plans according to priorities, breaking down milestones to achieve useful capabilities and distributing the funding accordingly. For instance, per an interviewee, data on the implementation strategies can be collected and assessed through trial stages to determine whether funding strategies need to be restructured and budgeted accordingly. In the same vein, the importance of strengthening procurement vehicles — delivery, data, testing and prototyping, and talent — for the different agencies cannot be understated. Reassuring agencies that their most crucial demands, such as next-generation hardware, prototyping funds, and talent recruitment, are being accounted for will increase the likelihood of their engagement in and optimism for the ZTA maturation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agencies should operate within budget and will therefore seek funding before embarking on transitions to fulfill ZTA policies. Interviewed experts agreed that budget prioritization will be an inescapable layer in the larger ZTA implementation plan. To ensure every relevant agency obtains the necessary funding to shift toward ZTA and adopt EDR as a result, government budgeting bodies will need to be realistic about the expenses associated with these initiatives and the types of funding each agency will require while eliminating non-integrated and redundant solutions. In its role, the ONCD should assist agencies to prioritize and strategically coordinate funding. Additionally, per an interviewed expert, by providing more support for models that operate within the appropriations cycle, the ONCD can help agencies accelerate ZTA adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong talent acquisition remains an ongoing challenge across the DOD and broader federal defense agencies. Among other things, cultural factors have largely impeded progress in hiring top technical and cyber talent. CSIS’s interviewees agreed that to secure the country’s critical infrastructure against cyberattacks and implement a culture of zero trust, the government needs to create a strong pool of individuals who are not only skilled for the job but also share the mission values. Creating a technically competent workforce is central to effectively implementing ZTA across the federal government since this model requires a cybersecurity understanding and mindset distributed across the federal employees responsible for implementing it. Workforce generation, therefore, is an important tool in the implementation processes of ZTA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiring strong talent and creating a tech-leaning workforce can be achieved through two means: instituting reforms and new initiatives among hiring authorities and borrowing tech talent from the private sector themes that are strongly emphasized in the Cyberspace Solarium Commission 2.0’s recently published white paper on the cyber workforce. Interviews revealed strong consensus among government officials that federal agencies struggle to attract and retain critical talent. Above all, agencies must strategize on how to communicate the concept of zero trust to their workforce and adopt a mission strategy that the workforce can own as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Creating a technically competent workforce is central to effectively implementing ZTA across the federal government since this model requires a cybersecurity understanding and mindset distributed across the federal employees responsible for implementing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talent acquisition and retainment are heavily contingent upon creating the right working culture and environment. The federal government has struggled with a cultural perception problem, where many people are repelled by the government’s bureaucratic and “slow-moving ship” reputation. To add to this problem, the federal government’s performance appraisal system currently does not incentivize adoption of ZTA principles or transitioning old cybersecurity approaches to new, robust measures within the federal agencies. Agencies should foster a cybersecurity culture that moves away from the check-list approach and instead embraces learning, innovation, disruption, and diversity in talent and skills and encourages employees to take on new initiatives without instilling the paranoia of failures. In short, it should adopt the private sector approach of “fail fast, recover faster.” Investment should, therefore, be geared toward fostering interest in the mission while acknowledging the zero trust learning curve, especially with individuals without a cyber background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to obtain a much-needed cyber workforce, the government must collaborate with its fierce competitor for talent: the private sector. Some private companies are relatively able to better integrate new talent but also create new talent. These companies offer not only larger salaries but also provide attractive incentives, such as a culture and environment of fast-paced innovation, opportunities for growth, and training and education programs. Through partnerships, the government can borrow technical talent from private companies to accelerate the adoption of the new zero trust strategy along with training emerging talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fostering the right behavior takes time, developing new skills is a lengthy process, and the need to develop hygiene for cybersecurity has not yet diffused across all the agencies and the workforce. Ultimately, acquiring an inclusive, skilled, vibrant, and diverse workforce will hinge upon organizational restructuring at all levels of management to effectively reform government agencies’ organizational cultures and working environments.&lt;/p&gt;

Better-than-expected Ukrainian defenses seem to be one hallmark of this invasion and the primary reason why Russian cyber efforts have had limited effect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that Ukraine, forewarned by Russian cyber actions that began as early as 2014, was better prepared as a result. It was also assisted in its cyber defense by friendly countries and private actors with whom it had developed cooperative relationships before the conflict. This preparation allowed it to deflect many Russian offensive cyber operations, suggesting that a well-prepared and energetic defense can have the advantage over offense in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia had previously used cyberattacks against Ukraine to destroy or damage infrastructure and data. It attempted to do so again in 2022. Based on publicly available information, Russia launched a broad cyber campaign shortly before the invasion (see the appendix for a list of known events). Some reporting showed a huge increase in exploits on the first day. The intent appears to have been to create disorder and overwhelm Ukrainian defenses. Russia sought to disrupt services and install destructive malware on Ukrainian networks included phishing, denial of service, and taking advantage of software vulnerabilities. One company identified eight different families of destructive software used by Russia in these attacks. The primary targets were Ukrainian government websites, energy and telecom service providers, financial institutions, and media outlets, but the cyberattacks encompassed most critical sectors. This was a wide-ranging attack using the full suite of Russian cyber capabilities to disrupt Ukraine, but it was not a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s most significant cyber success so far was the disruption of the Starlink satellite internet system. This created significant damage that spread beyond Ukraine but ultimately did not provide military advantage to Russia. The attack may have been intended to be part of a larger, coordinated cyberattack that proved unsuccessful, or the Russians may not have expected the rapid restoration of service that was provided with outside assistance. The metric for Starlink and for other actions is not whether a cyberattack is effective in terms of network penetration or the disruption of services or data, but whether its effect helps achieve the desired military outcome — in this case, the occupation of Ukraine and the elimination of its elected government. By this metric, the Starlink attack was not a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A well-prepared and energetic defense can prevail over offense in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these attacks have been attributed by Ukrainian and Western sources to Russian government entities — chiefly the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence service, which has a history of using disruptive cyberattacks. In a few cases, proxy groups (such as the leading ransomware group Conti) were also involved, and in one reported instance, a Brazilian hacker group supportive of Russia attacked Ukrainian universities. All these hacking efforts, whether by the GRU or not, seem to have been poorly coordinated with Russian military actions in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-value-of-cyber-operations&quot;&gt;The Value of Cyber Operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conflicts involving modern militaries, cyberattacks are best used in combination with electronic warfare (EW), disinformation campaigns, antisatellite attacks, and precision-guided munitions. The objective is to degrade informational advantage and intangible assets (such as data), communications, intelligence assets, and weapons systems to produce operational advantage. The most damaging actions would combine precision-guided munitions and cyberattacks to disable or destroy critical targets. Cyber operations can also be used for political effect by disrupting finance, energy, transportation, and government services to overwhelm defenders’ decisionmaking and create social turmoil. Russia has been unable to achieve any of these objectives at meaningful scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may offend the cyber community to say it, but cyberattacks are overrated. While invaluable for espionage and crime, they are far from decisive in armed conflict. A pure cyberattack, as most analysts note, is inadequate to compel any but the most fragile opponent to accept defeat. No one has ever been killed by a cyberattack, and there are very few instances of tangible damage. “Logical” damage from attacks on software and data (such as the Iranian action against Aramco) are frequent, but these attacks usually do not create strategic advantage — which can be defined as forcing an opponent to make changes or concessions it would not have otherwise made — since they have not been used at scale and in a sustained manner, but rather in an uncoordinated and sporadic fashion. Sustained and systematic efforts are required to damage an opponent’s ability to resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks are overrated. While invaluable for espionage and crime, they are far from decisive in armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes real effort to make a cyberattack more than a dramatic annoyance. This requires planning, tool development, and reconnaissance, integrated with other offensive capabilities (as with the Israeli airstrike on Syrian nuclear facilities). The test of effectiveness lies in the results, measured by the extent of damage and whether the cyber operation forced an opponent to change plans or make concessions. Also, unlike a successful attack using a kinetic weapon, cyberattacks do not assure destruction (a radar hit by a missile can be seen to be a smoking ruin, but from the outside, a successful cyberattack on a radar may not look different from one that fails, and any damage may not be permanent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber operations in conflict are very useful to conduct espionage, to gain advance knowledge of opponent planning and capabilities, and to mislead. There was reportedly a surge of Russian action to penetrate North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) networks at the onset of the conflict, a sensible precaution from the Russian perspective, given its fear of the possibility of a NATO intervention. An attacker must weigh the loss of the benefits of espionage against the potential gain from a disruptive attack. In many cases, the benefits of espionage outweigh those of attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One apparent weakness of Russian cyber operations has been the seeming lack of coordination between cyber and conventional attacks. At a tactical level, cyberattacks provide benefits when combined with other weapons, including conventional delivery systems, precision-guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles, and electronic warfare. This combination can cripple command networks and advanced weapons systems and contribute to the attrition of opposing forces. However, when used in an ad hoc manner, or when uncoordinated with air and ground actions, cyberattacks prove less useful. Coordinating cyber and kinetic actions requires a high degree of planning and staff work that Russia either chose not to do or was incapable of doing. The timing of some Russian cyber operations suggests they were intended to support conventional operations but were unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks can be used to produce or amplify political effect, but it’s important to recognize that attacks are as likely to harden defenders’ will to resist as they are to sow panic. The most effective cyber tactic is to use hacking and misinformation (as was done in 2016 against the United States) to create confusion and inflame existing discontent, thus distracting governments by creating domestic social and political turmoil. Russia does not seem to have made serious efforts at this in Ukraine — sending texts and emails containing generic threats is juvenile. Unlike Russian actions in 2016, there does not appear to have been advanced planning and work to prepare the ground in Ukraine for political disruption. This is puzzling, given the attention in Russian doctrine to incorporate “pre-conflict” political preparation into attack planning and may indicate a somewhat spontaneous decision to invade Ukraine without careful preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian communications were inadequately secured. Corruption may have played a role in Russian communications weaknesses, with funds intended for secure communications equipment diverted to personal use. While Russia’s special operations forces have access to sophisticated tactical communications gear using strong encryption (judging from earlier operations in Ukraine), these were in short supply for other units in this invasion. Some Russian units relied on inadequately secured mass-market Chinese equipment. Others relied on Ukraine’s commercial telecommunication infrastructure. This reliance creates two major difficulties. First, when the Russians destroyed Ukrainian telecommunications infrastructure, whether inadvertently or intentionally, this hampered their own communications. Second, relying on an opponent’s communications system creates numerous possibilities for exploitation. Many speculate that one reason for the high casualty rate among Russian senior officers was that their vulnerable communications allowed their location to be pinpointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preparing-cyber-operations&quot;&gt;Preparing Cyber Operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carrying out successful cyber operations creates a heavy burden for an attacker’s workforce, planning, and intelligence support. In this, Ukraine helps highlight one strength of the U.S. military: its capacity for planning and staff work. The creation, decades ago, of regional combatant commanders who control naval, air, ground, and cyber forces can provide a coordinated assault (or defense) informed by long experience. One reason for U.S. losses in the Battle of the Coral Sea (1942) came from having two command structures that did not coordinate to provide adequate reconnaissance. The United States learned from this. It takes planning and preparation to maximize the return on a cyberattack, and this is best achieved when cyberattacks are integrated with other offensive capabilities. The emphasis on joint operations that began with Goldwater-Nichols is another strength that can give the United States an advantage in the use of offensive cyber operations. Success is derived from the ability of a commander to deliver effect, inflict damage, and force an opponent to retreat, change plans, or surrender. Cyber operations can play an important part if they are used to prepare the ground and in coordination with other capabilities, something that requires staff work, intelligence support, and planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writings by Russian authors suggest that they know that cyberattacks can disrupt logistics and communications (this was part of their planning for conflict with). Such attacks provide military advantage, and better planned or better executed Russian attacks on Ukraine’s logistics and communications could have used cyber means to disrupt Ukrainian command and control, interfere with air defense systems and logistics, and inject uncertainty and doubt into commanders’ decisionmaking (on troop location or on supply status, for example). The failure (so far) to disrupt Ukrainian operations, logistics, and communications probably reflects the haphazard nature of Russian planning, flawed assumptions about the reception Russian forces would receive, and the strength of the Ukrainian cyber defenses. As with the ground invasion, there was a miscalculation about the strength and effectiveness of Ukrainian resistance. Russia may be reconsidering the use of cyber offense as it adjusts its initial and flawed strategy. However, if Russian forces now move to strategies similar to what they used in Grozny or Syria — indiscriminate bombardment to level civilian and military targets — this may make cyberattacks, which are less destructive and less certain, a lower priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has shown how not to use cyber operations to gain advantage in armed conflict, but its efforts highlight best practices. The most obvious lesson is the need for adequate preparation to generate coordinated, simultaneous strikes on critical targets. The second is to achieve cyber superiority by crippling cyber defenders. The third is to prepare the battlefield politically and psychologically and to control the public narrative of the campaign as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hacktivism&quot;&gt;Hacktivism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One dilemma for analysis is the tendency to confuse the symbolic actions of hacktivists for actual strategic effect. While celebrated in the media, the various cyber actions against Russian websites by private actors had no effect on Russian military operations, its military capabilities, or, as far as anyone can tell, Putin’s strategic calculations. The results of the activities of “hacktivists” and their efforts against Russia are exaggerated. Russia did not change course or alter plans as a result of these hacktivist efforts, nor was the Russian capability to engage in offensive operations, spotty as it may have been, degraded by hacktivist action. Russian public opinion, largely supportive of the war, seems unaffected by hacktivism. By these measures, hacktivism is irrelevant to the course of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The various cyber actions against Russian websites by private actors had no effect on Russia military operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the onset of conflict, thousands of volunteers engaged in cyber actions against Russia and to defend Ukrainian network targets. The most difficult problem with an “army” of thousands of civilian volunteers is coordination. The mechanisms and infrastructure for coordination require advance preparation. Estonia’s Cyber Defense Unit is an example of how such groups can be organized to be effective. Estonia assisted Ukraine before the invasion, and it is possible that some of the volunteer cyber defenders were organized in ways that assigned them to priority targets, avoided both duplication of effort and gaps, and made them a more reliable source of auxiliary cyber capability. The lesson for other countries is that volunteers can provide valuable assistance in defense if their efforts are coordinated and a framework for coordination and partnership with government agencies is developed in advance of conflict. Ukrainian civilian efforts to provide intelligence on Russian forces, while dependent on networks, are not exactly “cyber” efforts, but they provided real benefit to defenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conditions under which hacktivism might have an effect vary according to the political situation of the target country. A government that feels vulnerable to attack or invasion may fear that hacktivism is the precursor to more drastic actions, an indicator of opponent intent. A country that is politically vulnerable with a discontented population will be more vulnerable. In contrast, an authoritarian state that is not particularly sensitive to what its population thinks, has well-developed propaganda and social control tools, and is willing to use forceful measures to suppress any opposition will not feel that hacktivism poses much of a threat. It is easy for Western observers to underestimate the success of Russian (and Chinese) media control and propaganda, but these have been successful in building public support and outweigh the effect of hacktivism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;external-targets&quot;&gt;External Targets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is not the only possible target for cyber action, and Russia appears to have considered cyber operations against the United States and allies. The United States has not been attacked, as Putin may have calculated that cyber action against it or its allies would broaden conflict without benefiting Russia and make the war even more difficult to manage. This could change as Putin becomes more frustrated with the failure of his initial plans, but the fundamental strategic considerations remain the same — a cyberattack on the United States would be unlikely to advance Russia’s goals in Ukraine and would increase the chances of failure. This consideration will likely continue to shape any Russian cyber action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One element of Russia’s initial calculations appears to have been that Western political leadership and societies are risk averse, would choose inaction, and would succumb to threats. This has so far proven erroneous (and explains Russia’s need to intensify pressure by uttering nuclear threats). However, Putin may yield to temptation and launch a damaging cyber operation against the United States or its allies. If he continues to follow a risk-minimization approach, this temptation would be to repeat something like the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, which panicked American consumers and created political stress for the Biden administration while offering a shred of deniability. Moscow could attribute the action to criminals, deny culpability, and promise to take action against them. This would even support the short-lived Russian effort to renew cyber talks with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia could unleash something like NotPetya, which cost the global economy millions of dollars (without providing benefit to Russia). More damaging attacks against nations in the “near abroad,” like Moldova, are also a possibility. The considerations for possible action are to create political turmoil in the victim country, stay below the level of use of force to reduce the risk of retaliation, and provide some degree of deniability, no matter how flimsy. As sanctions continue to uncouple the Russian economy from the West, the cost of such attacks may decrease for Russia, removing a disincentive for cyber action. Wars are not won by playing punishing pranks, even pranks that are expensive for the victim. The key question for any Russian decision is whether it increases the likelihood that Russia will make progress toward its goals in Ukraine. Malicious actions like NotPetya do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A disruptive cyberattack against U.S. critical infrastructure probably makes little sense from the Kremlin’s perspective. It would not force the United States to stop supporting Ukraine, it would not degrade U.S. military capabilities, and it would create political pressure for a more forceful U.S. response. Russian leaders lost respect for the United States after the defeats in Iraq and Afghanistan (although the Biden administration is beginning to make them reconsider this), but that does not mean they want to start a war with the United States. Russia’s preference is to make progress on its goals in Ukraine while avoiding expanded conflict with NATO or the United States. A limited cyberattack against the United States would only make Russia’s situation worse by broadening the conflict, and while the Kremlin enjoys the use of bellicose threats, it has been much more circumspect in its actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better tactic for Russia might have been to inflame existing discontent in democratic nations (as was done in 2016) in advance of the invasion, to distract governments by creating domestic problems. The Russians do not seem to have attempted this, and in Europe they face a substantial barrier created by their lack of credibility and the hostility the invasion has engendered in European populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian official statements are a poor indicator of intent, since they are designed to manipulate Western opinion and appeal to the nationalist sentiments of Russia’s domestic audience. They often bear only a tenuous relationship to fact. Russia believes U.S. strategic thinking is risk averse. Its own strategic culture places greater reliance on the use of exaggerated threats. Threats are a Russian diplomatic tactic, and the difficulty in differentiating between ploy and plan increases the uncertainty that is normal in warfare. The concern is that these threats may increasingly reflect a Russian leadership that is willing to consider ideas (nuclear weapons use, cyberattacks on the West) that were once thought taboo or would seem unreasonable to a rational policymaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;control-of-the-narrative&quot;&gt;Control of the Narrative&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battle for control of the narrative largely occurs in a digital space and can be shaped by cyber actions. Russian attention to controlling the narrative about the invasion, to deflect criticism and win public support, reflects long-standing Russian doctrine on the importance of the political and psychological context of conflict. It informs both cyber and electronic warfare (EW) operations. This effort has had mixed results and the narrative contest remains undecided. It was unsuccessful in Ukraine and among Ukraine’s supporters. Putin has lost in the Western democracies and Ukraine but has won in Russia and is at least holding his own with non-Western audiences in China (abetted by China’s own propaganda and narrative control efforts), India, Africa, the Middle East, and some Latin American countries. This success outside of Ukraine is more a reflection of the damage done to U.S. credibility under previous administrations rather than the skill of Russian propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Putin has lost in the Western democracies and Ukraine but has won in Russia and is at least holding his own with non-Western audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians deployed a number of mobile and relatively modern EW systems in theater that have information warfare capabilities, such as the Leer-3. Leer-3 comes with drones that can be used to jam telecommunications and provide capabilities similar to Western Stingray systems to capture mobile phone traffic and monitor social media for exploitation and psychological warfare (including sending mass text messages to mobile phone numbers it collects).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting its larger propaganda failure, Russia was unable to craft compelling content for a Ukrainian audience. A standard Russian tactic is to hack databases or emails and then leak them for damaging effect. Sometimes this stolen data is falsified to amplify effect. This tactic did not work for Russia in its invasion. One lesson is that despite its skill and experience in disinformation, Russia struggled to rebut declassified Western intelligence that rapidly undercut Russian assertions. Nor was Russian propaganda sufficient to hide the undeniable evidence of aggression, violations of international law, and horrific human rights violations that were publicly available from many nongovernmental sources. Propaganda is most effective when it exploits existing beliefs, discontent, or skepticism, but when these preconditions do not exist, even constant repetition is insufficient to have persuasive effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another lesson from Ukraine is that future wars will need to take into account the ubiquity of mobile phone cameras, public access to satellite imagery, and even communications intercepts using online services like WebSDR. These public, nongovernmental sources of information undercut any effort to control the narrative while providing real intelligence advantage. What used to be considered secret intelligence is becoming a publicly available good. Governments have not lost their monopoly of the use of force, but any monopoly they had on controlling information from war zones has largely disappeared. In theater, civilians can provide valuable information on opponent forces. Civilian actors can use digital and mobile technologies to greatly expand the amount of information available to the force they support and complicate efforts to falsify or disrupt it. Only the strictest censorship can hope to control the narrative and many news sources lie outside the scope of censorship. Russian efforts to jam cellular telephony or interfere with internet access in Ukraine were also unsuccessful. Planning how to degrade or control civilian communications spread across a decentralized global network networks will also need to become part of cyber offensive operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of private messaging services like Signal and Telegram (used by Russians and Ukrainians) can provide a degree of end-to-end encryption to preserve and secure communications. Use of these services gave Ukraine an advantage, both in social cohesion and in tactical intelligence. The Russian inability to deny access to messaging services was a significant intelligence failure and points to a larger issue. Global connectivity means that third party, non-belligerent services can provide services that are difficult for an attacker to disrupt unless they are willing to attack neutral third parties. This can make key services difficult to deny and strengthen the ability to resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What used to be considered secret intelligence is becoming a publicly available good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-defense&quot;&gt;Cyber Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For cyber defense, the conflict in Ukraine is instructive. Cyberattacks need not be unstoppable for a prepared and determined defender. Russia found itself at a disadvantage because Ukraine appears to have learned from the damaging cyberattacks carried out by Russia in 2014 and 2016. The most important elements of Ukrainian defense were preparation and hardening of likely targets, partnerships and assistance from foreign cyber actors, and rapid reaction to nullify attacks, detected by monitoring of critical networks. Countries large and small can copy this for their own cyber defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian agencies played the leading role in defense, but defense did not rely entirely on governmental or even Ukrainian assets. Ukraine had a network of partners (both governments and companies) who were able to provide training and assistance, including remote monitoring and mitigation, before the invasion and after it began. Tech companies provided invaluable assistance. Collective action that blended national and foreign, government and private, gave Ukraine an advantage in monitoring and in rapid reaction to block attacks and repair or eliminate vulnerabilities. Russian attackers were often frustrated in their attempts and even when successful, the success was short lived. The lesson is to develop relationships and integrate partners through actions that go beyond meetings and seminars to include planning and exercises well in advance of any attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine published a national cybersecurity strategy in 2016 and established a degree of redundancy and resilience for data and expanding the use of encryption before the invasion. It implemented some basic cyber “hygiene” measures after 2015. Cyber hygiene before an attack is important, but the most important element of defense is the ability to identify and react quickly. Ukraine (with external assistance) undertook real-time monitoring of critical networks and systems to detect exploits early on and then act quickly to counter them. This requires continuous monitoring, an area where many countries could improve performance. Any network perimeter can be breached, and all software has exploitable flaws. It is the ability to respond immediately and effectively to cyber intrusions that seems to be the key to a successful defense. This requires continuous monitoring, an area where many countries could improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine reportedly used a third-party hosting arrangement to move some data and services outside of the geographic boundaries of the conflict. If nothing else, this complicated and constrained Russian planning. Small countries can design digital infrastructure and data architecture that takes advantage of extraterritorial third-party service providers to minimize exposure, increase resilience, and complicate an attacker’s task. The commercial operations behind the internet do not always follow geographic boundaries. This diffusion will increase as governments move to rely on cloud services and other remote services (including software as a service and satellite connectivity). Attacking these remote services located in noncombatant countries poses the risk of repercussion an attacker may prefer to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Small countries can design digital infrastructure and data architecture that takes advantage of extraterritorial third-party service providers to minimize exposure, increase resilience, and complicate an attacker’s task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larger countries like the United States could face problems of scale in copying this kind of defense if Russia or China decided to launch cyber operations against them similar to what was attempted in Ukraine. The United States is a “target-rich” environment, and it is not yet organized or resourced to duplicate Ukraine’s success. However, this sort of direct attack is still unlikely, while many of the lessons from the Ukrainian conflict are applicable. The most important of this may be to prepare now for cyberattacks against critical infrastructure (an area where the United States has made progress) and crucial data (where it may be less prepared). That makes the issue for the United States how to apply lessons and best practices for national defense learned in Ukraine in situations short of armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preliminary-conclusions&quot;&gt;Preliminary Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No defense is perfect, but Ukraine’s efforts have so far been able to thwart the Russian cyberattacks. This combination of defensive measures is a package that can be duplicated by other nations. The conclusions so far from Ukraine are that for offensive operations, planning for cyber operations must be integrated into broader campaign planning and gauge where and when their use is beneficial. A combined arms approach, where cyber is integrated with other offensive capabilities, will gain the full benefit, since cyberattacks are an imperfect substitute for kinetic action and must be used in a sequence linked to other modes of attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, cyber offense would benefit from increasing the lethality and predictability of cyberattacks to improve their utility in offense. Cyberattacks already perform well in speed, range, and precision (to the extent those variables apply) and may offer greater possibilities for surprise, but their destructive capabilities are still limited. When a missile destroys a power plant, the smoking rubble can be observed. It is more difficult to tell if a cyberattack has succeeded or how permanent the effect will be. This will require emphasizing the use of cyberattacks to focus on disrupting command mechanisms, weapons software, and information as much or more than physical destruction. An attacker’s decision to use cyberattacks must calculate whether their use makes the conflict more or less manageable and weigh this against how much use contributes to achieving strategic effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For offense, a campaign plan needs to include a realistic and specific assessment of the benefits and costs of cyber operations, including the cost to intelligence collection and the political effect on both combatants and external parties — realistic because of the limitations of cyberattacks, specific because very often a cyber operation will require a tailored quality determined by the nature of the target network and the intended effect. At a minimum, this will require both reconnaissance of the target network and “weapons” design (writing code for use in the attack) well in advance of any attack, along with testing and “refreshing” attack tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the extent that cyberattacks harm civilians, including degrading their access to online services and social media, this will create a degree of repugnance. The international community is less tolerant of collateral damage or deliberate attacks on civilian targets, and these can have damaging political consequences for an attacker. Planning for offense must take into account the politics of cyberattacks over connected civilian networks. Russia did not, and this was another mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict in Ukraine can inform the United States and its allies on how to defend against offensive cyber operations directed against it by opponents, but China or even Iran may have also learned from the Russian experience. For cyber actions, Ukraine is probably not a safe precedent for conflict with any possible attack by China. China is better equipped and likely to have better planning. The United States may also not want to count on ineptitude among these opponents, even if they share authoritarian (and thus potentially idiosyncratic) decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber operations failed to advance Russian goals — the occupation of Ukraine and the replacement of its elected government. Some of the mistakes that Russia made are becoming clear. Ukraine was not the first cyber war nor was cyberattack particularly useful to the Russians. The Ukrainian defenders and their partners did a good job of reacting quickly to deflect Russian efforts to disrupt networks. They do not appear to have faced a well-thought-out plan of attack integrated into broader campaign planning. This may be the most important lesson for cyber warfare from Ukraine: preparation and planning on how to integrate cyber operations with other modes of attack to achieve maximum effect makes cyberattacks useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This CCP Inc. case study explores how Chinese diplomatic, regulatory, financial, and commercial actors work in concert to secure critical minerals in the West African nation of Guinea.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Efforts in Guinea to mine bauxite and iron ore, the primary inputs for aluminum and steel, illuminate Beijing’s conduits for influencing and supporting its geo-economic objectives. Examining one key Chinese player in Guinea’s mining sector, this study highlights state actors’ connections with nominally private Chinese companies and the importance of partnerships with state-owned enterprises for building costly infrastructure. Across multiple bauxite and iron ore mining ventures, Chinese diplomatic support and state financing provided conduits to help further favored projects and increase Chinese companies’ access to Guinea’s mining industries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Chinese leader Xi Jinping, China’s political and economic system has undergone a significant transformation, further distinguishing its sui generis state capitalist system from market economies. Through reforms, regulatory actions, and political decrees, Beijing is strengthening Chinese Communist Party (CCP) control over both private firms and state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The Xi administration’s changes to the political economy have created a new iteration of China’s state capitalism, at the center of which lies an ecosystem of public, private, and hybrid-ownership firms pursuing a mix of commercial interests and government directives — a paradigm the authors call “CCP Inc.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, China’s state capitalist system was understood to consist of a core group of “national champions,” often large SOEs, working to support key policy initiatives in a framework sometimes called “China Inc.” In contrast, “CCP Inc.” describes a more complex system in which the lines between public and private companies — or between commercial incentives and national interests — are frequently blurred or functionally irrelevant. Changes to domestic political and regulatory systems under the Xi administration underpin changes to Beijing’s influence over Chinese businesses. Increased CCP influence in the private sector, integration of networks of public and private Chinese companies, and new mechanisms for state-backed financing have shifted the conduits through which Beijing can influence enterprises and by which Chinese companies can draw on state support. This ecosystem is characterized by complex relationships, diverse interests, and a fluctuating balance between firms’ autonomy and state alignment. Beijing draws on a multifaceted tool kit of persuasion and coercion that includes diplomatic engagement, state financing, and other industrial policy measures to support strategically important initiatives and influence the commercial direction of firms operating globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an international context, companies within the CCP Inc. ecosystem obtain advantages that are unique to China’s political system. State-backed financing for strategic projects, horizontal alignment with other firms, the ability to tap SOEs to build infrastructure, and diplomatic support for commercial initiatives significantly benefit Chinese companies. Access to state support incentivizes Chinese companies to pursue business goals that align with the national interest and disincentivizes nonaligned behaviors, while government influence over financing and the state sector creates channels for Chinese policymakers to steer resources toward favored projects. However, the complexity and scale of the CCP Inc. ecosystem also creates degrees of separation between national directives and business outcomes. Owing to the opacity of this system, it is often impossible to determine the extent to which firms’ decisions are motivated by commercial logic versus influence from Beijing — particularly when business and government interests align. However, examining the outcomes of different business ventures can still provide a clearer view of Beijing’s influence tool kit and the pathways through which companies benefit from integration into CCP Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Beijing draws on a multifaceted tool kit of persuasion and coercion that includes diplomatic engagement, state financing, and other industrial policy measures to support strategically important initiatives and influence the commercial direction of firms operating globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study explores how the CCP Inc. ecosystem has positioned Chinese companies to gain access to strategic commodities, in this case iron ore and bauxite in Guinea. In the past few decades, China has sourced growing amounts of key natural resources from countries across Africa, becoming the continent’s biggest trading partner and largest provider of foreign direct investment. In Guinea, the influx of Chinese companies into mining sectors throughout the late 2010s helped China secure access to inputs for key national industries and deepen bilateral ties between Conakry and Beijing. Between burgeoning networks of Chinese SOEs, state-backed lenders, diplomatic missions, and private metals companies, Guinea’s mining sector became home to a growing CCP Inc. ecosystem, creating advantages for Chinese companies that benefited from state support and public-private collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case study focuses on the SMB-Winning Consortium, one of Guinea’s top mineral exporters, to gain a view into how the CCP Inc ecosystem operates. A consortium that includes both state-owned and private Chinese companies, SMB-Winning has been operating in Guinea since 2014 — first in bauxite, which is a key input in the production of aluminum, and later in iron ore, which is used to make steel. The SMB-Winning Consortium’s expansion in Guinea occurred within a context of deepening Chinese diplomatic engagement with Conakry and state financing for the country’s raw-material sectors that benefited multiple Chinese companies. Among these companies, the consortium’s combination of public-private partnership and participation in both bauxite and iron ore ventures provides a particularly insightful view of the CCP Inc. ecosystem in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study will proceed in three parts. The first section will examine connections between the state and private sector in the CCP Inc. ecosystem. The SMB-Winning Consortium’s connections to other Chinese companies and the CCP can be traced through ownership, investment flows, party membership among the consortium’s leadership, and its use of SOE contractors to construct important infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second section explores how commercial ventures in bauxite fit into the broader picture of deepening Chinese-Guinean relations. Since the mid-2010s, Beijing and Conakry have exchanged multiple state visits, and China issued a $20 billion loan to Guinea, which later joined the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2018. Government-loan disclosures, diplomatic documents, and corporate press releases show that Chinese state-owned companies benefited directly from state financing, and many Chinese companies involved in the bauxite sector in turn sought to emphasize their own role in carrying out Chinese policy initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final section of this report looks at efforts by the SMB-Winning Consortium and state-owned Chinese metals companies to extract iron ore from the Simandou mine in eastern Guinea. Though Simandou is the site of the world’s largest undeveloped stores of iron ore, political setbacks and high costs have stalled commercial efforts to develop the mine for years. Its uncertain business outlook made conduits of state support for Chinese companies readily visible. In 2020, media stories cited anonymous sources claiming that China’s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) was weighing further support for the project, including by directing SOEs to help with construction and talking to Chinese banks about financing. This financial element of the CCP Inc. ecosystem demonstrates another part of Beijing’s tool kit for influencing international business operations: that of managing capital as a tool to steer corporate fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;viewing-ccp-inc-connectivity-through-the-smb-winning-consortium&quot;&gt;Viewing CCP Inc. Connectivity through the SMB-Winning Consortium&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;An Overview of the SMB-Winning Consortium’s Ventures in Guinea&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shifts in international minerals markets and China’s trade relationships affected the timeline of SMB-Winning’s involvement, first in Guinea’s bauxite sector and later in iron ore. China is the world’s largest producer of aluminum; as such, securing access to bauxite aligns with Beijing’s macroeconomic objectives — not to mention the financial interests of China’s many aluminum companies. While numerous enterprises are now involved in developing Guinea’s bauxite sector — including a number of Chinese state-owned metals companies — SMB-Winning remains one of the dominant players in the industry, alongside the Anglo-Australian-Guinean Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée (CBG) and Russia’s RUSAL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The onset of SMB-Winning’s bauxite operations in Guinea coincided with the Indonesian government’s ban on bauxite exports in 2014. Since then, Guinea has overtaken Indonesia as China’s largest supplier of bauxite, supplying over 50 percent of imports even after Indonesia lifted its bauxite ban in 2017. Now, as Indonesia prepares to again ban exports in 2023, industry leaders in China are confident that Guinea can make up the coming shortfall. After China successfully secured access to bauxite supplies, later efforts by Chinese companies to tap iron ore from Guinea’s Simandou mine also aligned with Beijing’s interest in diversifying iron ore supplies, particularly to reduce iron ore dependence on Australia amid worsening bilateral relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, a consortium of multinational businesses may not seem a likely example of integration into the CCP Inc. ecosystem. But a closer look at SMB-Winning’s ownership structure, ties to the CCP, and business history demonstrates that connectivity to Chinese state actors and the CCP lies at its core. Moreover, the consortium’s frequent partnerships with SOEs illuminate how access to networks of state-owned Chinese firms enabled it to achieve its commercial aims through connecting mines to railways, roads, and international ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PARTY TIES AND PUBLIC-PRIVATE CONNECTIVITY IN THE CCP INC. ECOSYSTEM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SMB-Winning Consortium operates in Guinea via local subsidiaries, the most prominent of which is the Société Minière de Boké (SMB). Of the three shareholding companies in these local subsidiaries, both Hongqiao Group and Winning International Group demonstrate how firms connect to each other and to Chinese state actors within the CCP Inc. ecosystem. Hongqiao Group is part-owned by a subsidiary of state financier CITIC Group, and its corporate leaders are CCP members. Though now a Singaporean company, Winning International Group was originally established in Hong Kong, describes itself as the “main shipping charrier” for large Chinese aluminum producers, and has a history of partnerships with Chinese SOEs. Thus, while SMB-Winning is technically an international consortium, three out of four of its corporate members are closely tied into the CCP Inc ecosystem: Yantai Port Group, Hongqiao Group, and Winning International Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the CCP Inc. ecosystem, both SOEs and nominally private Chinese firms have structural links to conduits of state financing and CCP influence. While SOEs are directly linked to the state through ownership, private companies’ ties to the ecosystem are more complex. Varying levels of direct and indirect state and party involvement make it difficult to pin down the definition of a “private” company in China. Due to blurred lines between government and private control, even classifying Chinese companies as state-owned versus privately owned is misleading. Particularly among China’s largest firms, true autonomy from the government is virtually nonexistent. State influence over private firms can be seen in the political connections of company leadership, pathways for government funding, and extralegal state coercion of private firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of SMB-Winning, consortium member Hongqiao Group demonstrates several of these elements of state control, despite being commonly labeled in media reports as a “private company.” Hongqiao Group was founded in 1994 by Zhang Shiping, a famous entrepreneur dubbed the “aluminum king of China.” Since its public listing in 2011, it overtook Russia’s RUSAL to become the world’s largest producer of aluminum. Hongqiao Group is still approximately 70 percent owned by the family of Zhang Shiping, who died in 2019. Another approximately 19 percent of company shares are publicly listed. The remaining company shares are owned by subsidiaries of CITIC Group, the largest state-run financial conglomerate in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this element of direct state ownership, Hongqiao Group’s leadership has strong connections to the CCP. The Zhang family is politically well connected: Zhang Shiping and his son Zhang Bo both are or were members of the CCP, demonstrating ties to the party-state at the highest level of corporate decisionmaking. Zhang Bo is now the chairman of both Hongqiao Group and its affiliate Shandong Weiqiao Pioneering Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though registered in Singapore, Winning International Group is also connected in the CCP Inc. ecosystem through its history in China, close relationships with Chinese SOEs, and its role as a primary shipper of metals for Chinese firms. Winning International Group was founded in Hong Kong; its CEO Sun Xiushun is a native of Shandong Province, where the group has a subsidiary in Qingdao. It owns shares in at least one state-owned company in China, Yantai Port Group subsidiary Yantai Port Weili Wharf Company Limited, but its connections to SOEs are mainly apparent in the form of business partnerships. Along with its partnership with Yantai Port Group, Winning International’s company website lists further affiliations, including a history of cooperation with state-owned Aluminum Corporation of China Ltd. (Chinalco) and a strategic cooperation framework signed in 2021 with Sinotrans Huazhong, which is 33 percent state owned. This history of business partnerships demonstrates that although Winning International Group is now headquartered in Singapore, its main function is shipping to China, and the firm has deep connections with Chinese SOEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SOE PARTNERSHIPS ENABLE THE SMB-WINNING CONSORTIUM TO BUILD TRANSPORTATION ROUTES&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During SMB-Winning’s commercial journey in Guinea, successive partnerships with state-owned enterprises have played a crucial role in enabling mining projects, most prominently through Yantai Port Group. A state-owned enterprise under the control of Shandong Province, Yantai Port Group was counted as a key member of the consortium even though it is not a financial shareholder. Instead of financial backing, Yantai Port Group offers international shipping capacity, helping the consortium build the transportation chain needed to move bauxite to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In SMB-Winning’s original bauxite operations and later efforts at Simandou, the construction of new railways, coordination of ground transportation, and connection to international shipping routes have been critical to mineral extraction. In the bauxite-rich western region of Boké, SMB-Winning oversaw the construction of Guinea’s “first modern railway,” the Dapilon–Santou line (几内亚达圣铁路), which, according to company announcements, began operating in June 2021 to connect the Santou bauxite-mining area to the port of Dapilon. Construction of the Dapilon–Santou railway was carried out by three Chinese SOEs: China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC), China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC), and Ansteel Corporation. The consortium’s later promise to build an even longer “trans-Guinean” railway from Simandou helped it secure mining contracts over an Australian competitor that did not commit to the same ambitious level of infrastructure building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the consortium tapped Chinese SOEs to construct the flagship railway projects, demonstrating how access to SOE collaboration can allow companies in the CCP Inc. ecosystem to leverage important construction and logistics resources. While contracting third parties to aid in an international resource project is not necessarily unusual, the network of state-backed entities within the CCP Inc. ecosystem stands out when compared to the infrastructure support that companies from other countries could expect. A U.S. company, for example, could not draw on a ready lineup of state-backed entities to help construct the extensive infrastructure needed to connect a remote overseas mining concession to an international port — nor could any foreign company that comes from an economy governed by market principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;diplomatic-support-and-chinas-foreign-policy-initiatives-in-guineas-bauxite-sector&quot;&gt;Diplomatic Support and China’s Foreign Policy Initiatives in Guinea’s Bauxite Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the past seven years, along with becoming a key bauxite supplier for China, Guinea’s ties to Beijing deepened through a series of high-level state visits, Guinea’s participation in key Chinese policy initiatives, and state-backed loans from Beijing. Diplomatic support can be a key mechanism for state influence in the CCP Inc. ecosystem, such as through diplomatic engagement to promote strategic projects, the inclusion of Chinese companies in loan agreements, and the overall attention that Beijing pays to promoting Chinese companies abroad. Beijing used this tool kit in Guinea, conditioning loans on SOEs’ access to bauxite concessions and promoting strategic industries in official meetings. The timeline of SMB-Winning’s expansion in bauxite mining closely aligned with broader trends in Guinean-Chinese relations, and its interactions with Chinese SOEs provide an example of how companies within the CCP Inc. ecosystem can receive different levels of state support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Guinea, Chinese state involvement included regular ambassadorial meetings and visits from government and policy-bank representatives during which officials pushed China’s foreign policy and geo-economic initiatives. For instance, in a September 2018 meeting with Chairman Wang Yang of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Guinean president Alpha Condé expressed that Guinea placed great importance on its cooperation in the BRI, which both parties signed an agreement to jointly support. Following these engagements, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), a ministerial-level department of the State Council, also became involved in promoting industrial cooperation with Guinea. In June 2019, Ning Jizhe, the deputy director of the NDRC, and Guinean director of the cabinet Ibrahima Khalil Kaba met to discuss cooperation between China and Guinea in bauxite and infrastructure development projects. While these meetings may not be directly associated with specific action regarding Chinese mining projects in Guinea, they outline a correlation between China’s increasing involvement in Guinea’s mining industry and its larger strategic goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;former-president-condé-and-chinese-guinean-relations&quot;&gt;FORMER PRESIDENT CONDÉ AND CHINESE-GUINEAN RELATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Former Guinean president Alpha Condé, who was deposed in a September 2021 military coup, played a critical role in facilitating closer relations between Guinea and China. Condé ruled Guinea from 2010 and used his long-standing leadership to position himself as a key partner in China’s expansion of relations with African nations under the Xi administration. During Condé’s 2016 state visit to Beijing, the two countries established a comprehensive strategic partnership, including an announcement that China pledged to aid Guinea with resource development and infrastructure construction. The two leaders met twice more before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic: at the 2017 Dialogue of Emerging Market and Developing Countries in Xiamen and ahead of the 2018 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) summit in Beijing. China supported Condé after his reelection in 2020, offering congratulations at a critical time for the president, who was facing allegations from political opposition that he had rigged the election. The overthrow of Alpha Condé underscored the political risks of depending on Guinean government goodwill, potentially making Beijing less willing in the future to rely on such a politically unstable supplier for more critical minerals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of bauxite in China’s overall relationship with Guinea is evident in the $20 billion loan that the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) granted the government of Guinea in 2017 — a sum nearly double Guinea’s gross domestic product (GDP) that year. ICBC’s 20-year agreement with the government of Guinea promises funding for infrastructure projects, with repayment made through revenue generated by mining. Moreover, the loan agreement includes bauxite mining concessions for three Chinese state-owned companies: State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC), Chinalco, and China Henan International Cooperation Group. ICBC’s agreement with the Guinean government demonstrates how state financing can help position Chinese companies to seek advantage in strategic sectors, as well as exert state influence through the CCP Inc. ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of losing out to competition from this influx of state-backed Chinese companies included in the ICBC loan agreement, the SMB-Winning Consortium proceeded to expand its bauxite operations in the year following the deal, signing three contracts with the Guinean government in 2018 for the Dapilon–Santou railway, expanded mining concessions, and the construction of a new aluminum refinery. The relationships between SMB-Winning and the SOE beneficiaries of the ICBC loan demonstrate how collaboration within the CCP Inc. ecosystem can benefit companies that may otherwise have been competitors. Far from squeezing out other Chinese companies, SMB-Winning’s expansion assisted them; with the construction of the Dapilon–Santou railway, the consortium noted that this new infrastructure would also serve other bauxite operations along its length, including those of Chinalco, China’s second largest aluminum producer and a competitive rival to Hongqiao Group outside the cooperative context of CCP Inc. Moreover, the railway was only one example of consortium routes helping Chinalco; in a 2017 interview, Yantai Port Group president Ji Shaobo explained that its route for shipping bauxite to Hongqiao Group would also supply bauxite to Chinalco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against the backdrop of deepening bilateral ties between Guinea and China, and given the support that the Chinese state-backed apparatus could offer companies operating internationally, it was in the interest of businesses in the CCP Inc. orbit to emphasize their role in carrying our China’s policy goals — particularly in cases where business and national interests neatly converged. The SOEs that built and provided supplies to the Dapilon–Santou railway were vocal in labeling it as part of the BRI and a project that brought Chinese standards to Guinea. For example, CRCC described the railway as the SMB-Winning Consortium’s contribution to the BRI and China’s “going out” strategy, while Ansteel hailed its participation in the railway as a response to the call of the BRI that was designed to promote China’s development of international trade with Guinea. Even before Guinea signed onto the BRI, SMB-Winning counted itself as implementing the initiative and the “going out” strategy. Yantai Port Group described the route it set up between Guinea and Shandong as part of a maritime “aluminum silk road.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The relationships between SMB-Winning and the SOE beneficiaries of the ICBC loan demonstrate how collaboration within the CCP Inc. ecosystem can benefit companies that may otherwise have been competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside SOEs’ unsurprising promotion of Chinese policy goals, core private members in SMB-Winning also embraced alignment with the BRI. In 2019, Sun Xiushun spoke as a representative of the consortium at the establishment of the BRI Land-Sea Linkage Summit Forum in Qingdao. Even the Western representatives of the consortium have noted the importance of China’s national interests in its bauxite ventures. In one 2017 interview, UMS chief Fadi Wazni and SMB CEO Frederic Bouzigues touted the strength of Chinese-Guinean relations and described the consortium as operating under the concept of “win-win cooperation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;simandou&quot;&gt;Simandou&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Testing State Support in a Commercially and Politically Troubled Venture&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of deepening ties between Beijing and Conakry, during which China successfully used Guinean imports to diversify its supply of bauxite, it is unsurprising that Chinese policymakers and industry leaders looked with heightened interest at Guinea for supplies of another in-demand raw mineral: iron ore. Guinea’s Simandou mine is the site of the world’s largest undeveloped deposits of iron ore, which is also of higher grade than that of many other iron mines, making it less emissions-intense to process. China’s high dependence on iron ore imports makes the country extremely sensitive to price changes. The ability to tap Guinea’s resources would reduce Beijing’s reliance on Australia, which provides about 60 percent of China’s iron ore imports. Amid worsening relations with Canberra, the NDRC has appealed for increasing domestic production and diversifying international supplies — alongside calls for coercive economic actions against Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2022, the Guinean government briefly suspended operations at Simandou, underlining the political risks to China’s mineral interests in Guinea. On March 10, Interim President Mamady Doumbouya, who took office after the September 2021 military coup against Alpha Condé, announced cessation of all activity at Simandou pending clarification of how “the interests of Guinea will be served.” A few weeks later, the Guinean government reached an agreement with SMB-Winning and the other companies invested in Simandou to resume operations at the mine, provided that these companies work together to ensure the construction of the trans-Guinean railway and Guinean deep-water port needed to connect the mine to international shipping routes. Moreover, the Guinean government set a tight timeframe for completing construction and bringing Simandou into commercial production, else companies involved could face penalties up to the withdrawal of mining licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Guinean government’s new timeline, the construction of a trans-Guinean railway and a deep-water port must be completed by the end of 2024, then commercial production of iron ore from the mine must follow in 2025. While the project remains subject to a tight deadline and steep costs, its outlook appears clearer following the agreement with the government. Expectations of lasting high iron ore prices and Beijing’s support for a project that helps secure iron ore supplies may breathe new life into the troubled project. The global shockwaves of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also affect interest in Simandou. Higher commodity prices and growing anxiety about exposure to sanctions risk could make Chinese officials view Simandou as increasingly important; unlike Australia, Guinea has a long history of maintaining a nonaligned stance on global conflicts. While the Simandou suspension demonstrates that Guinea’s new government does not always prioritize China’s interests, Beijing may see even greater risk in overreliance on Australia due to its much closer ties to the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;simandous-troubled-investment-history&quot;&gt;SIMANDOU’S TROUBLED INVESTMENT HISTORY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite being the largest untapped iron ore mine in the world, Simandou comes with a history of legal disputes, allegations of corruption, and high costs that have hindered the project’s development. Multinational mining companies have tried and failed to bring its ore to international markets for decades. Rio Tinto (which still owns 45 percent of Simandou’s southern blocks 3 and 4) was first granted license to develop the mine in 1997, only to be stripped of its rights to blocks 1 and 2 by a 2008 presidential decree. Those rights were then granted to Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz’s BSG Resources (BSGR), which later sold 51 percent of its Guinean assets to Brazilian mining giant Vale in 2010. BSGR and Vale’s entrance into Simandou marked the start of years of allegations of corruption and illegality in both companies’ practices, resulting in multiple lawsuits fought out between Rio Tinto, BSGR, and Vale in U.S. courts, as well as a Guinean government inquiry concluding that BSGR won its mining rights via bribery. In 2019, BSGR walked away from Simandou as part of a settlement with the Guinean government. Through a joint venture with a Chinalco affiliate, Rio Tinto later split blocks 3 and 4 with the Chinese state-owned aluminum company, with the government of Guinea maintaining a 15 percent share in the two southern blocks. Reports from 2020 indicate that China Baowu Steel Group Corp. acquired shares in Chinalco’s stake in blocks 3 and 4. In 2019, SMB-Winning won the bids for blocks 1 and 2. However, the new mine participants have yet to bring Simandou into commercial production. Simandou’s long history of political and legal obstacles provided the backdrop for the Guinean government’s March 2022 temporary suspension of operations at the mine, serving a reminder that conflict between the Guinean government and the companies developing Simandou is hardly new.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;THE SMB-WINNING CONSORTIUM’S HISTORY AT SIMANDOU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The involvement of the SMB-Winning Consortium and other Chinese companies at Simandou further illustrates the conduits through which CCP Inc. can support a strategically important project. In November 2019, the SMB-Winning Consortium won an international bid for Simandou’s northern concessions (blocks 1 and 2) and established new Guinean subsidiaries to oversee mining development and construction of a railway — thereby joining the Chinese SOEs involved in the southern Simandou blocks alongside Anglo-American mining giant Rio Tinto. The Guinean government chose SMB-Winning over Fortesque Metals Group, an Australian iron ore company, which reportedly offered $9 billion for rights to develop the two blocks of the mine but did not commit to building the trans-Guinean railway and port facilities that SMB-Winning promised. This demonstrated the capacity of Chinese SOEs to provide logistics and transportation solutions to support CCP Inc.–integrated development projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in Guinea’s bauxite sector, efforts to develop Simandou were not carried out by SMB-Winning alone; rather, fellow Chinese companies worked with the consortium to push the project forward, both through contracts to build the trans-Guinean railway and investments in other parts of the mine. China Baowu Steel Group Corp., a Chinese state-owned metal company now engaged in the southern blocks of Simandou, had arranged investments that would directly benefit the SMB-Winning Consortium. Caixin reported in 2020 that Baowu planned to invest $6 billion into Simandou — made up of contributions from Baowu, other steelmakers, one of China’s sovereign wealth funds, and other unspecified institutional or infrastructure investors — to include $1.5 billion for the northern blocks held by SMB-Winning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high costs of the project meant that commercial incentives alone may have been insufficient to ensure the mine’s development. The March 2022 agreement between the Guinean government and the companies at Simandou affirmed that building a trans-Guinean railway and deep-water port to transport iron ore out of Simandou’s remote region would require a $15 billion investment (the Guinean government has resisted allowing developers to ship ore via an easier route to a Liberian port). The resulting production cost of iron ore from Simandou could reach $35–$40 per ton, compared to the $15–$20 per ton of iron ore from Australia, making the project more vulnerable to market shifts or price wars. This combination of high up-front costs and exposure to volatile price shifts weakens business incentives to develop Simandou. Through the lens of CCP Inc., however, both business and policy incentives could work together to push the project forward. Baowu’s inclusion of SMB-Winning in its Simandou investment supports its own business interests in helping the mine as a whole connect to international shipping lanes via the trans-Guinean railway. The mutually beneficial investment is also in line with public and private Chinese companies’ track record of collaborating to promote projects that further Beijing’s geo-economic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the financial challenges that hindered Simandou’s development, Chinese state funding and SOE aid in constructing the expensive infrastructure needed to connect the mine to international markets have for years been an important factor in the mine’s prospects. Baowu’s 2020 entrance to the Simandou project certainly shows a degree of state-backed interest in pushing the project forward despite a cloudy financial outlook. Bloomberg reported in 2020 that SASAC was “actively” pushing forward with the project, including holding talks with SOEs about building the infrastructure to connect Simandou to international ports and drawing on the China Development Bank (CDB) and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) for funding. However, the willingness of state institutions to spend the money to bring Simandou’s reserves to market was uncertain even before the temporary suspension of operations in March 2022. According to one source cited by Caixin, state lenders in 2020 were not interested in offering state backing to the Simandou project, due to concerns about the overcapacity of China’s domestic steel industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WHAT DOES SIMANDOU INDICATE ABOUT CCP INC.?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP Inc. ecosystem of state-backed support woven throughout the operations of private companies has been particularly visible at Simandou due to the project’s difficult financial outlook. Past speculation in the media about whether SASAC, the government body tasked with managing SOEs, would step in to support the troubled project reveals Beijing’s attention to a specific iron ore project in a more direct way than does broad support for opening the country’s mining sector. Now, with a new deadline set by the Guinean government, Chinese companies — among both the SMB-Winning Consortium and the SOEs helping develop the trans-Guinean railway and southern mining blocks — are playing the leading role in pushing the project forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming the agreement between the Guinean government and the developers of Simandou holds, several factors could offer insight into the CCP Inc. ecosystem. The position of Rio Tinto, the only current corporate actor at the mine without strong ties to China, could indicate how companies outside of the CCP Inc. ecosystem can benefit — or lose out — in projects dominated by Chinese companies. Even before the 2022 government ruling, Rio Tinto’s position in the mine vis-à-vis Chinese companies was uneasy. Given that increased iron ore supply in global markets could hurt other lines of Rio Tinto’s business, some analysts projected that keeping Simandou on the back burner was company strategy. Moving forward, Rio Tinto’s involvement in the trans-Guinean railway could heighten tensions over the project’s adverse environmental impact since Rio Tinto has pledged to improve its commitment to high environmental standards. While Rio Tinto’s board signaled its support for moving forward with Simandou, Rio Tinto’s corporate relations with SMB-Winning, Chinalco, and Baowu remain uncertain, as does the prospect of future Chinese state aid for the project. Will SASAC still consider coordinating with policy banks and SOEs to support the project? Could Chinese diplomatic support help smooth over relations between Simandou’s developers and the new Doumbouya government?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the future of Simandou may depend on both China’s willingness to provide state aid and the dedication of shareholding companies to backing the project politically and financially. Along with the political upheaval of the military coup against Alpha Condé, 2021 marked a tumultuous year in iron ore prices, prompting many industry analysts to warn of a protracted period of price volatility — driven in part by demand fluctuation within China’s own domestic market. As Simandou’s development proceeds, China’s willingness to support the project through any diplomatic or financial means will provide insight into Beijing’s tolerance for both political risk and commercial uncertainty in CCP Inc. ventures. However, it may take years to draw such conclusions about the significance of Simandou in the CCP Inc. ecosystem, especially given the long-term investment horizon common to the mining sector, which SMB CEO Frederic Bouzigues pithily underscored in saying, “Mining is about decades.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complex array of private and state-owned players working together in pursuit of both national and commercial interests, as outlined throughout this publication, presents critical insight into the CCP Inc. ecosystem in action and the conduits of state support for Guinea’s mining sector. As the SMB-Winning Consortium’s operations have become more extensive, so too has its connectivity to Chinese state-backed entities, from contracting SOEs to build the Dapilon–Santou railway to benefiting from their investments in the Simandou project. SMB-Winning’s operations also benefited other SOEs in the industry, for example by providing Chinalco access to key transportation routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examining CCP Inc.’s role in Guinea’s bauxite and iron ore development through the lens of SMB-Winning’s business ventures illustrates how a private company’s personnel links to the CCP, close partnerships with public companies, and ad hoc collaboration with SOEs can expand a single corporate entity’s resources and capacity. The ability to draw on SOEs for construction of railways proved a key part of both bauxite development in northeastern Guinea and the planned connection of Simandou to a new Guinean port. While SMB-Winning benefited from the capacity support offered by transportation SOEs, other public Chinese companies received more direct state support through their inclusion in ICBC’s major concession-tied loan to the Guinean government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Simandou, the conduit of state financing for strategic projects was more evident, this time to aid both SOEs and the SMB-Winning Consortium’s private members through Baowu’s investment in the mining project and the possibility of further SASAC intervention. Simandou’s troubled financial outlook means that even media speculation about the potential for Beijing to step in and provide further support for Chinese companies operating there could affect the project’s prospects by boosting investor confidence in the mine’s development. Given the divergence between China’s national interest in diversifying supplies of iron ore versus the uncertain commercial rewards of developing an expensive source of ore in a risky political environment, it is even easier to isolate the role of state influence at Simandou than in the case of bauxite mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examining the CCP Inc. ecosystem involves analyzing many moving targets, a fact underscored by the suspension of operations at Simandou while this report was being researched. The history of SOE partnerships in the bauxite sector, deepening ties between Beijing and the Condé government, and speculation over SASAC back at Simandou demonstrate conduits for state influence and the interplay between commercial and national interests in the CCP Inc. ecosystem. Moving forward, Simandou could provide further insight on how CCP Inc. responds to contingencies. How much is Beijing willing to spend in terms of diplomatic and financial support on a project with uncertain commercial prospects and definite political risks? The mine’s future ultimately lies in a wide-ranging tangle of business interests, international iron ore prices, environmental feasibility, and Guinean government approval, not just potential Chinese state support. In the end, Simandou may show the limits of state support within the CCP Inc. ecosystem, with competing corporate and local interests playing important roles in both enabling and limiting Beijing’s economic statecraft. But whatever the ultimate outcome, the hallmarks of CCP Inc. — and its ability to significantly advance private and state commercial interests that align with China’s national strategic goals — have already been evident in these Guinean investments for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If data is the new oil, it could be said that chips are the new steel — a fundamental component of national power similar to the foundational role steel production played in the industrial age. As such, semiconductor chips are a natural focus for government intervention and support to accelerate growth and build secure supply chains.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;The specific goals for U.S. semiconductor policy are to increase reliability and trust in supply, reinforce all elements of chip-making capacity, and reduce China’s role in the supply chain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chip production is based on complex, globally distributed, specialized supply chains involving many stages in production, including specialized materials, production equipment, design and related software, fabrication, testing, and packaging. In some stages of production, labor costs are important; in others, it is capital costs because a cutting-edge fabrication plant, or fab, can cost more than $12 billion. Taiwan, South Korea, the United States, Japan, Singapore, and China are the leading chip-producing nations. There are also important facilities (often subsidiaries of a leading producer) in Europe, Southeast Asia, South America, and Israel. This global distribution has led some to push for greater production in the United States, but trying to “reshore” a global supply chain spread across many countries would be counterproductive if the goal is a reliable and more productive supply chain. The problem is China, not global production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The politics of the chip industry are generally favorable to the United States. One leading producer, South Korea, is a treaty ally and faces less risk of disruption from China than does Taiwan. Another leading producer, Japan, is one of the most important U.S. security partners and, with the United States, dominates the production of semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME). ASML, another leading producer of SME, based in the Netherlands, is also an important ally. Singapore, while it would prefer not to be caught in a battle between giants, is also a dependable partner. These countries share democratic values and in many instances are treaty allies. The global distribution of chip-making in countries friendly to the United States is an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The many segments in the semiconductor supply chain — from materials to design, fabrication, packaging, and testing — create opportunities for multinational cooperation. Not all segments need to be located in the same country. Striving for self-sufficiency in the United States or Europe will impose serious efficiency costs and forego a key advantage over China: partnerships already built on a strong commercial foundation and shared political values based on the rule of law and democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Striving for self-sufficiency in the United States or Europe will impose serious efficiency costs and forego a key advantage over China: partnerships already built on a strong commercial foundation and shared political values based on the rule of law and democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reshoring also runs counter to a fundamental change in how chips are made — the success of the “fabless and foundry” production model. Fabless means a company designs and markets chips but contracts their production to a third party. The foundry bears the financial burden of maintaining state-of-the-art fabs. This is a commercially viable alternative used by many leading tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, has a 50 percent share in the fabless market. However, TSMC’s proximity to China, which has routinely threatened to invade and absorb Taiwan, creates a potential security risk. The greatest geopolitical vulnerability in this global industry is Taiwan. Taiwan, after decades of investment, dominates the production of the most advanced chips but faces greater risk from an increasingly belligerent China that routinely threatens to occupy it. Its proximity to China contributes to uncertainty, but even if China was friendly, letting a single nation achieve such a dominant role in a key industry may not make strategic or commercial sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether these Chinese threats are credible or not, they are recurrent, so much of the focus of U.S. policy has been to expand production capabilities outside of countries in close proximity to China — and some would like these to relocate to the United States itself. China’s threat and the onset of a chip “shortage” has led U.S. policymakers to consider how to strengthen this strategic industry. Discussion has tended to blur the distinction between the need to reduce reliance on China and Taiwan with reducing reliance on a global supply chain. In fact, the issues are slowing China’s growth while ensuring the United States and its allies have access to the chips they need. The United States has a fundamental decision to make on how much to rely on a transnational supply chain for chips rather than on indigenous production. This paper argues that the transnational approach — working with Japan, South Korea, Europe, and other partners — is by far the best path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a risk that in the pursuit of a reliable supply chain, the United States will seek to build a national chip production base rather than follow the model used by successful chip companies — a model that spreads design, fabrication, and other production segments around the world. Intel, for example, has manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia, Costa Rica, Israel, and Ireland. While there are concerns that the United States will not be able to “securely buy them [chips] at will from other nations,” it is difficult to envision a scenario where Ireland, Costa Rica, or Israel decide to embargo the United States. It is important to be precise: the problem is China, its industrial policies, and its intentions regarding Taiwan, not offshore production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe also has a fundamental decision to make on technological sovereignty and autonomy. This decision will determine whether Europe will catch up or decline in technology. The key question for Europe is partnership with the United States. It is in the United States’ interest to see a technologically strong Europe. It will harm the United States’ interests if Europe pursues autonomy and becomes weaker, but it will harm Europe’s interests more. Strategic autonomy has been the dream of some in Europe since de Gaulle, but it remains unrealistic. In building a closer partnership among democracies on technology, shared concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities make semiconductors a good candidate for increased cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;china-reshapes-the-global-chip-market&quot;&gt;China Reshapes the Global Chip Market&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is the center of the chip issue. Building a resilient and trustworthy international technology supply chain means a reduced role for China, given its predatory practices and the political risks of doing business with China under Xi Jinping. Doing this requires shrinking the market for Chinese suppliers, reducing the transfer of advanced chip technology (by not only using export controls but restricting Chinese investment), and limiting Chinese participation in research and development (R&amp;amp;D).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese policymakers have sought since the 1980s to build indigenous chip-making capabilities. They did this by providing ample financial support to Chinese companies, buttressed by industrial espionage and predatory business practices. If China competed fairly and if its goals were commercial instead of political, countries would accept this new competition. China’s chip effort, however, is distorted by its strategic goal to displace Western suppliers as part of its pursuit of a restructured global order that gives China dominance. China’s continued investments will increase its capacity and market share in the next decades regardless of U.S. and Japanese policy, but decisions by these countries (and the European Union) to continue to restrict Chinese access to chip technology can significantly slow this increase. While China’s goals are to build an indigenous supply chain and displace Western suppliers, Chinese experts admit privately that it will take more than a decade before they reach parity with Western chip suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue for supply chain resilience is the gravitational pull of the Chinese market. Companies in the United States and Europe enjoyed the heyday of globalization and would prefer to continue to invest in and sell to China. China is a leading global consumer of Western technology, including semiconductors (albeit often for products made to be reexported). As a result of its plans to build a dominant indigenous chip industry, China is also the leading market for SME. China’s chip industry must also acquire know-how, the intangible skills needed to produce chips at scale, by acquiring Western companies or by hiring Western engineers (and it is making a concerted effort in Taiwan to do this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has reacted to Western export restrictions by creating a “cross-border semiconductor work committee” to entice Western companies to invest in China (this may also be China’s response to the many national chip initiatives in other countries). The committee continues China’s long-standing policy of extracting technology from the West. Judging from past Chinese practice, this will include using coercive measures and incentives to extract technology. The Chinese effort faces serious obstacles from increasing export control restrictions in the West that block chip technology acquisition by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decisions on what can safely be transferred to China will shape the chip market for years. The argument from industry is that continued sales to China provide the revenue needed to support their R&amp;amp;D. There is some truth to this, and governments are not prepared to compensate companies for the loss of sales to China. However, the industry view can also discount security concerns and the longer-term competitive damage of continued sales to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative view, that the United States needs to move quickly to cut all chip and chip-related exports to China, makes even less sense. This would do immense damage to American companies. A good case can be made that it is in the United States’ interest to let Western companies continue to sell to China when the exports do not create an unacceptable risk. Commodity chips (those sold in the millions and not designed for specialized purposes) are low risk; SME is high risk. A policy that balances risk and opportunity will need to weigh the long-term security risks against the near-term benefits of continued revenue. This is not just a problem for the United States. Without restrictions by Europe, the United States, and Japan on exports to and acquisitions by China, efforts to rebuild a resilient chip industry will be pointless. This is particularly true for Europe, whose chip industry is least able to compete with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unchecked, China will seek to do to the semiconductor industry what it did to 4G telecom suppliers, using a blend of subsidies, predatory trade practices, and espionage to drive foreign competitors from the market. For semiconductors, this effort has been slowed by the Western reaction, which includes restrictions on Chinese acquisition of Western semiconductor companies and export restrictions on semiconductor-related technology. Blocking China cannot be the sole focus of policy because, at best, Western restrictions can only slow China, not stop it. Restrictions may give the West a decade at best. The goal should be to strengthen the Western semiconductor industry and build a new transnational chip supply chain independent of Chinese suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;demand-supply-and-autonomy&quot;&gt;Demand, Supply, and Autonomy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s market distortions are only one of the problems facing the chip industry. The other is that the world is at the limits of chip production capacity. The ongoing shortage of semiconductors shows how essential they have become for the global economy. Demand has grown more than 10 percent annually, and there was a more 20 percent surge in demand as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. This has led to a number of initiatives — such as the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act in the United States; the European Chips Act; and new programs in Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea — to expand supply and reinforce the chip supply chain. These initiatives include government support for R&amp;amp;D and workforce development; subsidies to reduce the cost of new facilities; and supportive trade, tax, and investment policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that servicing a global market that included China has led to strategically risky concentrations. Asian companies fabricate 75 percent of the global semiconductor supply. The semiconductor industry is centered around the Pacific Rim, giving the United States and Japan advantages as they strengthen their chip industries. Europe’s chip industry shrank as Asia’s grew and as manufacturing moved to China. This means that transatlantic partnership in chips is more important for Europe than for the United States, but the goal for policy should be to create a triumvirate of major chip producers — Japan, the United States, and the European Union — who form the core of supplier nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these three has strengths and weaknesses. Japan faces problems that are similar to those seen in the United States. Japan’s share of chip production declined to 10 percent in the last 30 years. According to interviews with Japanese officials, Japanese companies did not modernize their fabs. However, the country remains strong in other chip-making sectors like SME and materials. Japan’s partnership with the United States to restrict transfer of SME to China will significantly slow China’s chip industry growth. Japan is relatively better positioned than Europe to regain a greater degree of sufficiency in chips, given its tech giants, position in robotics, and its new policies to grow its semiconductor industry. Japan has committed to subsidies for chip-making (including for 5G infrastructure). Like the United States and Europe, Japan is also offering subsidies to foreign suppliers like TSMC to build in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe has strong capabilities in the research, design, and (with ASML) production of advanced manufacturing equipment. Europe is also strong in the production of earlier generations and specialized chips, such as those for automobiles, which do not need to be at the cutting edge of chip technology. However, Europe, like the United States and others, has been entranced with acquiring cutting-edge fabs, the most expensive and difficult element of chip production. Increasing EU market share is a sensible goal, but it may be best achieved by expanding in those segments of the chip supply chain where the European Union is already strong, or where there would be a security advantage in replacing Chinese firms (or Western firms located in China), such as in testing and packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three leading chip companies are TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. One question is whether Brussels can be content without adding a European company to this list of giants. But adding a chip company is easier said than done. China, after spending tens of billions of dollars for more than a decade and using illegal practices to gain advantage, could only produce a few companies that were on a path to becoming a major player (Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation and perhaps Yangtze Memory Technologies Company). But both were dependent on Western technology, so export controls and sanctions have seriously slowed their growth. For the most advanced chips (by feature size and performance), Chinese companies are unable to produce reliably at scale. This will take years to change, a period now made longer by sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all chips need to be at the cutting edge, however, and there is a broad market for microelectronics (such as transistors or converters), older generation “legacy” chips, and specialized industrial chips. Europe already has a strong presence in these sectors. A study by a leading United States chipmaker found that three-quarters of the chips in mobile phones are from an older generation. Some of the legacy chips and many of the microelectronic components in smartphones now come from China. The European Union would be better served by expanding capacity in these markets. A strong case can be made for the economic and political advantages of a transatlantic approach, in cooperation with Japan, to rebuilding the chip supply chain with a greatly reduced role for China, but the European Union will need to change its investment priorities to support this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European share of the global semiconductor industry could be increased if activities like testing and packaging are moved from China to lower-cost countries in Eastern Europe. U.S. tech companies are already investing in Europe, with Apple and Intel making major investments in semiconductor-related ventures. Europe could also expand on its strengths in research if the goal is market share rather than a completely indigenous supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Europe, fabless chip production can take advantage of the European strength in R&amp;amp;D. Arm, the UK chip design company, is the global leader and a case in point, but there are also world-leading design and research capabilities in Germany and Belgium. Pursuing a vertically integrated (i.e., all production segments) chip capacity will be expensive and time-consuming. An approach that takes advantage of specialization and segmentation in chip production and builds on a fabless approach promises quicker growth in market share and capability while aligning with U.S. and Japanese goals to reduce reliance on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;industrial-policy&quot;&gt;Industrial Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial policy was once considered taboo, but geopolitics makes it necessary again. The issue is how to design policies that are effective, take globalization into account, and build on Western strengths. Industrial policy requires government investment in industry and research, building institutions for cooperation with the private sector and with other governments, and a willingness to create national champions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Industrial policy requires government investment in industry and research, building institutions for cooperation with the private sector and with other governments, and a willingness to create national champions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of old-school industrial policy would be for a government to identify a need — say for airplanes, design, or the commission of airplane design — and then build plants to produce those planes (in this example), either managing the plants itself or contracting the management to a private company. This contractor need not be a company specializing in the product in question  — in World War II, heavy industry manufacturers like auto or washing machine makers were pressed into service to make planes, engines, and other munitions. For example, in the 1930s, the U.S. Army identified the need for a long-range bomber, wrote a 17-page specification, and then held a competition among aircraft manufacturers (the winner was Boeing and the B-17). This is still — in modified form — the model used in defense contracting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson of the B-17 is that industrial policy has two essential components: generous government spending and the creation and acceptance of national champions. Some government-directed coordination of industry (as with the creation of SEMATECH in the 1980s) can also help. Without these, the chance of a successful industrial policy declines. Both have difficulty for the United States, which has been parsimonious for decades (one reason chip fabrication has declined here) and reluctant to minimize anti-trust concern. Parsimony and antitrust are, however, luxuries the United States cannot afford in a conflict with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one industrial policy for semiconductors, the government could identify the type of chip it needs, set performance requirements, and award contracts. No country does this today. Secretary of Defense William Perry found 30 years ago that the Department of Defense could get better and cheaper chips from the commercial market than those made especially for the Pentagon. A very small number of highly specialized chips for sensitive national security purposes (like nuclear weapons) may need to still be designed by government labs and even produced there, but none of these chips are cutting-edge. Upgrading the fabs that now make them would cost tens of billions and would not provide for innovation or scalability in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other approaches to industrial policy could provide direct payments, low-cost or no-cost loans, or reduced taxes to the desired industry. China uses these techniques and they can be usefully mimicked. A third approach would be to lower the cost of inputs for production, such as by subsidizing R&amp;amp;D or needed infrastructure. This allows for a greater reliance on competition, which drives efficiency and innovation in ways that direct government subsidies to specific companies can undercut. Each approach can be used in combination and move the market in a direction desired by policymakers. In today’s international environment, such policies are more likely to succeed if they are collaborative and integrated into an international market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chips are part of a competition among economic models. China has found a way to (imperfectly) combine market forces and government direction to guide investment (whether Xi’s political clampdown damages China’s investment and innovation model remains to be seen). The Chinese Communist Party has agreed on industrial targets (like building a chip industry) and is willing to spend consistently for decades at levels democracies are unwilling to match. Head-to-head competition spending would be unwise. In any response to security concerns or the chip shortage, repeating China’s government-directed efforts to expand its national semiconductor industry would be unwise. This has squandered billions of dollars because state programs in China often subsidize inefficiency. The United States should not do the same — not just because it is a waste of resources, but also because it is politically unsustainable in democracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is not just how to reinforce or accelerate the commercial production of semiconductors. If the United States is vulnerable, it is not in chips but in microelectronics at large. Over the last decades, manufacturing of them has shifted out of the United States and Europe to lower-cost producers in China. These are basic components, such as transistors, capacitors, or converters, which are neither sophisticated nor expensive — the margins on microelectronics are low. If China cannot make digital goods without U.S. semiconductors, the United States cannot make digital goods without microelectronics from China. An industrial policy among allies and partners could usefully focus on rebuilding microelectronic capacity and other segments of the chip industry, such as testing and packaging, rather than on the more glamorous fabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shortages-gluts-and-subsidy-races&quot;&gt;Shortages, Gluts, and Subsidy “Races”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most major chip-producing nations already subsidize chip manufacturing. There has been a subsidy “race” for years as countries compete to recruit chip manufacturers to their territory. An Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development study found that 10 out of 11 countries with major chip industries used some form of subsidies. The effect is telling. The United States has consistently held around 50 percent of the global chip market, but its share of chip fabrication has declined steadily to about 11 percent. One reason for this is that the United States (at the federal level) has not used subsidies, in contrast to other chip-producing nations. The CHIPS for America Act and the related Facilitating American-Built Semiconductors (FABS) Act could change this by providing federal subsidies to locate production in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ending the chip shortage cannot be the focus of policymaking. Because it takes three to four years (and many billions of dollars) to bring new chip fabrication capacity online, the shortage will be over before new facilities can have an effect. The chip shortage highlights problems with the “old” supply chain, which included China and was based on “just-in-time” sourcing. It also points to weaknesses in economic prediction. Car companies accepted reports that the pandemic would lead to a prolonged economic reversal. In fact, those who pointed to a “V-shaped” recovery were right. At the start of the pandemic, car companies canceled chip orders and their place in the queue was often taken by manufacturers of digital consumer devices, where demand is surging. Some chip makers who supplied the car industry retooled for other markets. The demand for chips in 2021 increased by 26 percent as fears of a pandemic recession receded, exceeding the capacity of existing suppliers. Unsurprisingly, the response has been to call for increased production and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-term growth in demand for chips means that any “glut” created by overinvestment in production or subsidies will be temporary. The growth in demand is tied to the continued digitization of economic activity, which is very unlikely to stop. Overinvestment would be a short-term phenomenon and is still more efficient than centrally directed investment. Leading chip companies already say they plan to increase investment by 50 percent over 2019 levels. China is also planning massive investments, and one policy issue is how to accommodate new Chinese chip production in the global market — China will be in the market whether we like it or not, making subsidies crucial for competition and the creation of rules for competition and countering China’s predatory trade practices a central requirement for policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary cost for increased chip production is the cost of capital, including human capital. One reason Europe’s share of chip production declined dramatically reflects higher labor costs compared to China and others. The “supply” of capital depends on the global capital market and interest rates, while human capital depends on investments in R&amp;amp;D and education. Governments can shift the cost curve for chip companies in ways that increase supply and resilience through monetary policy (although the current “easy money” era is coming to an end); through targeted incentives in taxes, R&amp;amp;D, infrastructure, and STEM education; and through supportive trade and intellectual property policies. If subsidies can reinforce private investment, the fundamental effect will be to shift the location of production as well as expand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most countries that provide subsidies are content with conditioning support on location, since this creates jobs, tax revenues, and increased market share. Congress should resist the temptation to attach conditions to the funding that are not directly related to increasing the supply of chips because this will be counterproductive in a global competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-cooperative-structures&quot;&gt;Building Cooperative Structures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overarching interest in seeing a strong technological and economic partnership among democracies requires creating a policy superstructure to reinforce market decisions. The creation of the EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council, though it has only begun its work, provides a useful mechanism for reaching an agreement on policy, but there are tensions between the potential benefits of cooperation and a desire for autonomy that will need to be pragmatically addressed. The Quad (Australia, India, Japan, and the United States) offers another opportunity for cooperation and coordination of policy goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective policy should resist the temptation to pursue autarkic self-reliance and instead reinforce a multinational approach to strengthening chip-making in democracies. When measured by cost and performance, market-based transnational supply chains — based on company specialization — are more efficient and innovative than national supply chains. This multinational approach provides an innate advantage over China. A trustworthy and economically viable transnational supply chain will need to extend beyond the United States and include Mexico, Canada, Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, the European Union, and most importantly, Japan. It should use competition among firms to achieve efficiency. For some digital technologies like artificial intelligence, guiding principles and rules will be necessary to ensure responsible development, but this is not important for semiconductors. In all cases, policy should avoid a centrally directed approach that invests in a fully indigenous industry. This is a greater danger than a “subsidy race.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some previous efforts to create transnational supply chains using government subsidies ran into difficulties in managing the dynamics of competition. An effort to create a transatlantic defense industrial base ran into opposition on both sides of the Atlantic because of the interest in preserving company and national advantage. Companies naturally prefer that any subsidies favor national participants, but in a globally distributed industry, this can be counterproductive and in the European Union, this can mean a discussion among all 27 member states over the allocation of support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parochial concerns are understandable but do not often lead to the best economic outcomes. Instead, cooperation in expanding the provision of the public goods required by the semiconductor industry, including research, workforce, infrastructure, the “soft infrastructure” of intellectual privacy protections, and financial systems to guide investments, can reduce the cost of inputs in chip-making and reinforce market-driven investment decisions. These are the areas for government action and cooperation between the United States and its allies. This kind of cooperation would allow the West to cooperate strategically at the same time as its companies compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is unlikely to change course in its international goals or industrial strategies. This will create unusual market dynamics that do not fit neatly into national policy boxes. China will build a bigger chip industry to serve its domestic market and global customers and will continue its attempts to move up the chip “value chain.” Sellers will want access to the Chinese domestic market. Chip customers globally will prefer low costs, taking into account political risk and trustworthiness. One key decision is how to accommodate Chinese demand without damaging security, since there is no black or white answer to this. The result of these political dynamics will be two loosely connected supply chains competing for the same markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democratic governments have fundamental political decisions to make on how to cooperate and take advantage of a transnational supply chain. There will be challenges in designing such policies, but successful cooperation will leave democracies richer and stronger in the current contest.&lt;/p&gt;

As Xi steadily supports Putin with a strong commitment to the informal alliance between China and Russia, the dissenting voices among the policy elites have advocated distancing China from Russia’s military venture in Ukraine. Meanwhile, criticisms of Xi’s stance on the Ukraine war have also appeared in social media. Such criticisms highlight China’s national interest, which is inherently more skeptical of Russia, rather than endorse a close partnership. This essay analyzes Xi’s personal and political interests in maintaining a pro-Putin policy, the potential connection between the observed policy divergences and the elite power struggle ahead of China’s 20th Party Congress, and Xi’s attempts to turn his policy liability into an asset and thus gain leverage in the forthcoming CCP leadership reorganization.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China as a one-party state is usually seen by outsiders as a coherent actor in international politics, but a close examination of divergent elite views about the country’s official responses to the Russian invasion of Ukraine shows that such coherence does not exist. As in other countries, foreign policy in China is affected by domestic politics and vice versa. With the ruling CCP scheduled to reorganize its top leadership at its 20th National Party Congress in the fall of this year, divergences over this foreign-policy issue and the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could have a material impact on the outcome of the congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since mid-March, some Chinese policy elites have begun to openly express dissenting views about the Ukraine war and to question China’s close relations with Putin’s Russia and its increasingly tense ties with the West. Such a policy divergence has occurred mainly between Chinese strongman Xi Jinping and some foreign-policy elites who are politically tied to the pre-Xi top leaders. As Xi maintains his support for Putin and persists with his informal alliance with Russia, recent dissenting voices call for distancing China from Russia’s military venture in Ukraine. Meanwhile, criticisms of Xi’s stance on the Ukraine war have also appeared in social media, highlighting China’s national interest and its past victimization by Russia (and the Soviet Union). Disagreements over this critical foreign-policy issue will likely become heavily politicized and may even pose a challenge to Xi’s plan for a third term as party chief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is reasonable to argue that the Ukraine war has disrupted Xi’s 2022 political agenda and has forced the Chinese regime to confront the consequences of a potential geopolitical game-changer. The war has raised important questions about Chinese foreign policy and domestic politics. Will China’s domestic power game ahead of the 20th Party Congress be affected by developments related to China’s stance on the war? Why has Xi Jinping attached his political fortunes to Putin’s military venture in Ukraine? What are the sources of discontent among some CCP elites about the war? How were they able to express their discontent with Xi despite the regime’s tight control of the media and of discussions about sensitive political issues, and how might such voices influence China’s policy making on Ukraine and the balance of power within the CCP? To address these questions, we first analyze Xi Jinping’s political motivations for supporting Putin’s military venture in Ukraine, and then we discuss the emergence of some recent dissenting voices among policy elites and in social media. Finally, we explore how such different policy attitudes toward the Ukraine war may affect China’s leadership politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;comrade-dictators-xi-jinpings-undeclared-alliance-with-putin-based-on-his-personal-ambitions&quot;&gt;Comrade Dictators: Xi Jinping’s Undeclared Alliance with Putin Based on His Personal Ambitions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately before Vladimir Putin ordered that his troops invade Ukraine on February 24, 2022, he took an extraordinary tour to Beijing on February 4. The ostensible purpose of his visit to China was to attend the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games. However, the official Chinese press billed the visit as an extraordinarily significant international event. It stressed the long personal relationship between Xi and Putin, highlighting the fact that Putin’s visit to Beijing fell on the very first day of spring according to the Chinese lunar calendar and marking the start of the Year of the Tiger. Official media also underscored that the Xi-Putin summit was held despite the pandemic and that it was the 38th meeting between the two leaders since Xi became PRC president in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to calling attention to these facts, official Chinese media dwelt on some more weighty aspects of Sino-Russian relations, in particular China’s extraordinarily close partnership with Russia in international politics, the two countries’ close bilateral cooperation, and the significant role the two leaders play in their cooperation and partnership. While Putin was in Beijing, China and Russia signed fifteen agreements covering many important fields of cooperation and trade ties, ranging from natural gas, oil, and grain, to satellites, information technology, and data. One of Xi’s favorite protégés, director of the CCTV Group Shen Haixiong (慎海雄), who is among the youngest of China’s ministers, published his interview with Putin, in which Putin highlighted his “regular and close communications” with Xi and repeated that “China is Russia’s strategic partner on the international stage.” The CCP propaganda machine boasted that China’s cooperation with Russia was “without limits,” and that the two countries were “shoulder to shoulder and back to back” connected “together in defending international fairness and justice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly noteworthy is that China’s military forces enthusiastically joined in the effusive praise of the Sino-Russian relationship and in the two leaders’ contribution to the relationship. A Jiefangjun bao (解放军报, The PLA Daily) piece reposted on the webpage of the PRC Ministry of National Defense prominently features an image of Xi and Putin standing together in Moscow’s Red Square as Russian jet fighters roared across the sky. The article concludes that the” Sino-Russian relationships is in the best shape on record, and it has already become a great power relationship with the highest degree of mutual trust, cooperation and coordination, and strategic value; the key to such a relationship is the strategic leadership of the leaders of the two states.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Days later, following publication of the above-cited piece, Russian air force jets flew across the Ukrainian sky, marking the beginning of its disastrous invasion on February 24. On the following day, Xi phoned Putin to “exchange opinions concerning the current Ukrainian situation.” The official readout of their conversation highlights Putin’s congratulations to Xi for the success of the Beijing Winter Olympics and Xi’s implicit endorsement of Putin’s actions in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that for decades Beijing has taken care to cultivate its “comprehensive, strategic, and cooperative partnership” with Moscow. Furthermore, since taking power, Xi has never tried to hide his admiration of Putin. This exceptional closeness between the two leaders may be attributed to a number of factors, such as the collectivist mentality of those of Xi’s generation who grew up in the early days of the People’s Republic when the CCP regarded the Soviet Union as its big brother as well as Xi’s family background (his father was a veteran revolutionary when the CCP was supported and financed by the CPSU-led Comintern). Another key factor is Xi’s perception of Putin as a hero who was able to build a strongman-ruled regime in post-Soviet Russia. Pragmatic geopolitical considerations, however, are much more important than the CCP’s debt to the former Soviet Union or Xi’s own appreciation of Putin’s domestic policy and risk-taking international conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Xi’s embrace of Putin at this critical juncture can also be attributed to the following three factors. First, Xi regards Putin as a comrade, and even a model, in achieving his personal and political ambitions to remain in power as an unchallengeable leader. In this regard, Putin, of course, is Xi’s big brother, as the former has already dominated Russian politics for more than twenty years and during his time at the apex of the Russian state, he has exercised firm control over the new Russian empire and earned himself the moniker “Putin the Great.” Although Xi and Putin are a similar age (Putin was born in October 1952, and Xi was born in April 1953), Xi rose to power much later and he is still struggling to overcome the CCP’s post-Mao norms and even elite resistance to win a third term as top leader. When he began his first term, Xi proposed the so-called “China Dream” to make China into a global superpower. His behavior during the past ten years indicates that his personal “China Dream” is perhaps to become “China’s Putin,” with at least quasi-life tenure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Xi embraces Putin as a comrade in the geopolitical and ideological struggle against the West. From the perspective of Chinese domestic politics, Putin’s anti-Communist rhetoric does not seem to be a problem for Xi. In fact, previous Chinese Communist leaders, including Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao, also firmly embraced the post-Soviet Russian leaders, including Boris Yeltsin, despite any political and ideological divergences that might have existed between Beijing and Moscow. The initial motivations for the Chinese leaders to endorse the post-Soviet leaders mainly involved geopolitical considerations and international relations, such as Chinese fears of Western sanctions and even containment during the post-Tiananmen era. As the new Putin regime increasingly revealed its anti-democratic nature, it was only natural for Beijing to reunite with its former Cold War ally to confront the West by both resisting pressures for a democratic transition at home and balancing against the United States abroad. Since coming to power Xi has accelerated and deepened these domestic and foreign-policy trends to such a degree that China and Russia have become the two foremost and formidable challengers to democracy and the world order. In recent years, Xi’s grand assessment has been that “the East is rising, while the West is declining” (东升西降). He sees the undeclared Sino-Russian alliance as the most significant strategic asset to reshape the international order, whereby the rise of the East will be part of a new world order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Putin’s military venture in Ukraine can be an inspiration for Xi to achieve his own ambition of using force to take back Taiwan. This was particularly the case before the Russian troops met the brave and effective resistance of the Ukrainian army. In fact, Xi has repeatedly declared his plan to “completely unify the motherland,” referring to a move that would make Taiwan a part of the People’s Republic of China. He regards reunification as a necessary and crucial step to fulfill his political ambition of “bringing China back to the center of the world stage” and, therefore, his personal dream of making himself one of the greatest leaders in Chinese history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Xi’s admiration for Putin and his anti-Western policies in both domestic and foreign affairs are closely connected with his ambition to be the great Maoist leader of China in the “new era.” It may be said that Xi has drawn inspiration from Putin’s ideological mindset, actions, and accomplishments (until the latter’s mishap in Ukraine) to replicate the Russian strongman’s success in China and to remain firmly in power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-national-interest-vs-the-leaders-interest-dissident-voices-among-policy-elites-and-on-social-media&quot;&gt;The National Interest vs. the Leader’s Interest: Dissident Voices among Policy Elites and on Social Media&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping’s personal interest, as embedded in his stance on the Ukraine war, is not identical to the organizational interests of the CCP, nor is it consistent with the national interest of China. But in a non-democratic political system that represses bottom-up expressions of group interests and social opinions, it is difficult to determine what the collective group interests are, let alone the collective interest of a huge political party like the CCP, which has 95 million members, or the collective interest of China as a nation. Being a dictator means that Xi is able to promote his personal interests, but it does not mean that he can entirely replace party or regime interests. Under certain circumstances, various social groups, especially the political elites, may have an opportunity to express opinions that are different from those of the dictator. The war in Ukraine, particularly the stalemate facing Putin’s military, has seemingly provided an opportunity for some Chinese policy elites and social media to voice discontent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such dissident voices began to emerge concurrently with the emergence of the Ukrainian resistance as well as with the emergence of an increase in Western moral and material support to Ukraine, and especially Western economic and financial sanctions against Russia. On March 5, a party-state–affiliated expert on Sino-American relations, named Hu Wei (胡伟), criticized Xi’s stance on the Russo-Ukraine war, urging that the Chinese regime should “accurately analyze and assess the direction of the war and its potential impact on the international landscape.” He emphasized that “in order to strive for a relatively favorable external environment, China must respond flexibly and make strategic choices that conform with its long-term interests,” and he openly suggested that “China cannot be tied to Putin and it must cut itself off [from Putin] as soon as possible.” On March 14, an essay with a similar argument and authored by Wang Huiyao (王辉耀) appeared on the Chinese webpage of the New York Times. It called for China to “offer the Russian leader an offramp” to end the military conflict in Ukraine. Both pieces emphasize the possible negative outcomes of the war for Russia, predicting a new rise of the West with this significant geopolitical event and highlight how Russia’s military failure and the Western responses to the war might have a disastrous effect on the Chinese regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both authors have important positions within the Chinese regime and run prestigious think-tanks. Hu Wei is based at Shanghai Jiaotong University, a university well known in recent decades for its famous graduate, former CCP general secretary and PRC president Jiang Zemin. In publishing Hu’s article, however, the website does not refer to his affiliation with the university; instead, it refers to his affiliation with the State Council and with the Charhar Institute (察哈尔学会), the latter being widely regarded as a white-glove organization of the Ministry of State Security. The New York Times introduces Wang Huiyao as director of the Beijing-based Center for Globalization and China, which “provides suggestions regarding globalization to the Chinese government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the website that published Hu’s article, US-China Perception Monitor (中美印象) is also a prestigious policy outlet. It is run by the Carter Center, established by former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, to promote U.S.-China relations, and it is under the leadership of Dr. Yawei Liu who is executive director and editor of the website. Liu’s elder brother, Liu Yazhou (刘亚洲), is a PLA general and son-in-law of former PRC president Li Xiannian (李先念). It has been reported, however, that General Liu was detained and investigated in December 2021, probably on orders from Xi Jinping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Chinese social media, similar voices have also appeared, but with even more blatant criticism of the government’s official stance on the Ukraine war and Sino-Russian relations, and with some even more radical suggestions raised by anonymous online commentators based on relatively unrealistic policy perspectives. For example, some such voices, based on the same rationale that Russia was using to justify its invasion of Ukraine, argued that while Russia is engaged in Ukraine, China should take the opportunity to send troops to the Siberian region of Russia to seize back those territories, historically part of imperial China, that were occupied by Tsarist Russia in the late nineteenth century. In particular, some Chinese internet users called for the restoration of China’s historical sovereignty over the sixty-four villages east of the Amur River (Heilong Jiang 黑龙江), known in Chinese as 江东六十四屯, where a group of Manchu, Daur, and Han-inhabited villages have been ruled by Russia. Some even pointed out that such a military action in the north would be more beneficial to China’s national interest than Xi’s southern target of Taiwan, as the Siberian region is large in area (it is said that in the region Tsarist Russia took territories of 1,540,000 square kilometer from China — that is roughly the size of Alaska, as, by contrast, Taiwan is 36,000 square kilometer) and rich in natural resources that China much needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, some Chinese citizens residing overseas painted a picture of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict that is fundamentally different from that which is presented to people within the PRC. Among them, Wang Jixian (王吉贤), a Chinese citizen living in Odessa, Ukraine, and working as a computer engineer, became popular (with 110,000 followers, though it is unclear how many of them actually reside in the mainland) due to his YouTube broadcasts about the war. Both Western and Chinese mainstream media began to notice this 37-year-old Beijinger, as a result of which the Chinese government banned his broadcasts within China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is common knowledge that social media in China is closely monitored and controlled by the government. The presence of even slightly dissident voices is politically noteworthy. Of course, this could be the result of occasional lapses in government censorship, but it is also possible that those in charge of monitoring the internet intentionally allowed these dissident views to get through because of their own differences with mainstream opinions. In any case, a convergence between policy elites’ criticism and social dissident voices regarding China’s official stance on the Ukraine war seems occurring, and such consonances have increased pressures over the Xi leadership on adjusting its pro-Putin policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the possibility, despite Xi’s efforts to place his own people in positions of authority, that some of those controlling the internet, who came to power during the Jiang Zemin years, remain loyal to the former leader. In addition, many of those in positions of authority in the internet sector have international backgrounds in terms of their personal lives, education, training, and social networking, particularly with the United States. Like those Chinese policy elites mentioned above, they too benefit from China’s deep global engagement. It would thus come as no surprise that at least some of them are unhappy with Xi’s foreign-policy attempts to reduce China’s ties with the West and they therefore are willing to permit such differences of opinion to circumvent the censorship controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-two-level-game-of-public-opinion-the-impact-of-events-in-ukraine-on-xi-and-the-20th-party-congress&quot;&gt;A Two-Level Game of Public Opinion: The Impact of Events in Ukraine on Xi and the 20th Party Congress&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For whatever reasons the dissident voices are able to be uttered by some elites and on social media, the mounting public-opinion pressures on Xi Jinping do point at questioning, ultimately, his plan of taking a third term in office at the 20th Party Congress. It might be unwise to exaggerate the policy impacts of these differences of opinion, but it does help to highlight a political dilemma that Xi certainly faces. Because Putin’s future in Ukraine is uncertain, Xi will be taking a risk if he remains too closely allied with Russia. But if he retreats from his alliance with Putin, his authority within the CCP would be challenged and his domination of the leadership reorganization at the forthcoming party congress might be seriously undermined — such that even his third term in office is called into question. Either way, the political aftermath of Putin’s military action will cast a dark shadow on Xi’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Xi also faces other serious challenges in domestic affairs. As this author observed several months ago, there has been a new tide of CCP elite resistance to Xi since the winter of 2021. Three major areas of policy disputes have apparently emerged, suggesting a power struggle that seems to have put Xi on the defensive. The Ukraine policy is one of such policy areas. Aside from it, China’s strategy on Covid-19 is constantly testing Xi’s leadership skills. The lockdown in Shanghai has turned into a series of humanitarian disasters, having some political ramifications that may damage Xi’s authority and upset his personnel plan for the 20th Party Congress. Equally challenging is China’s economic slowdown that has occurred primarily due to Xi’s harsh pandemic policy and his anti-market economic measures. All of these add new momentum to the power struggle within the CCP, with the potential of Xi’s predominance in the power redistribution being substantially reduced, if not fatally undermined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policy disputes aside, it seems that since March Xi has wobbly attempted some Janus-faced but superficial adjustments of his policy on the Ukraine war. There have been some contradictory statements by PRC diplomats and official organs, indicating that China might soften its policy position and move away from its position of supporting Russia “with no limits,” while still continuing to blame the U.S. and NATO for their eastward expansion “threat” to Russia. At the same time, Xi has recently also lowered his profile and has remained silent about the rise of the East and the decline of the West, and he has now rarely openly boasted about his friendship with Putin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such adjustments, of course, can be viewed as a policy failure on Xi’s part in the face of internal resistance and external pressures. However, they may also be seen as part of Xi’s updated strategy to overcome resistance and to defend his core political interests. The final arbiters will be whether Xi retreats from his ambition for quasi-life tenure and whether the Chinese regime abandons its anti-West attitude in international relations. To this observer, both these possibilities are highly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core of China’s current Ukraine strategy is to make superficial changes in terms of its international stance, while not altering its essential tilt toward Putin and Russia. In this context, it is interesting that so far, Xi and his regime have not imposed harsh punishments on such elite dissident opinions; mild censorship has simply blocked the flow of such criticism from overseas outlets to China’s domestic audiences. Based on these signs, it is too premature to conclude that Xi has lost control over the CCP propaganda machine. A more reasonable interpretation is that Xi’s team might have, early on, intentionally given a possible greenlight to some of the dissident ideas, especially those appearing in overseas outlets, while blocking their flow into China and censoring social criticism at the same time. The purpose of doing so might be to fool Western politicians and influence global public opinion so that China might not be seen as an enemy like Putin’s Russia. If such a ploy works and international pressures wane and if China is given a significant role in mediating between Russia and Ukraine, the credit will go primarily to Xi himself. Should such developments occur in the months leading up to the party congress in the fall, Xi likely will be able to turn around the current pressures and maintain his dominance at the 20th Party Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Chinese “war” on public opinion about the Ukraine war, therefore, a two-level game of manipulation seems to be emerging: some global-minded elites are playing on dissident opinions against Xi’s pro-Putin policy and his ambitious power plan for the 20th Party Congress, while Xi and his supporters are playing on the expression of such opinions against international pressures on Beijing to defend Xi’s ambitions at the congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This explains why those regime-affiliated outspoken experts have not been punished or even silenced for their criticism of Xi’s stance on the Ukraine war. Instead, more elite dissident voices continue to appear lately, as in the cases of Yan Xuetong’s (阎学通) article in Foreign Affairs and former Chinese ambassador to Ukraine Gao Yusheng’s (高玉生) public comments on Putin’s failure in Ukraine. The expression of these opinions is not necessarily organized by the regime or by a faction within the regime, but, with their control of the coercive means and the technological tools, it would not be difficult for Xi and his regime to crack down on such dissenting voices. There are mild measures against the expression of such opinions, as in the case of pulling off Gao’s comments from websites, but the virtual absence of a crackdown and punishments reveals the sophistication of China’s utilization of international soft power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this seemingly smart game, a danger for Xi still exists, which is the possibility of out-of-control of criticism. Timing is a critical factor at play here. In the few months before the party congress, likely in October or November this year, a lot can happen. An early, strategic retreat might buy back time for Xi’s leadership reorganization, but the unpredictability of the war in Ukraine may present even greater challenges to Xi, particularly if Putin’s political survival becomes endangered as his battlefield losses mount and popular opposition grows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concluding-remarks&quot;&gt;Concluding Remarks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every regime faces internal frictions, even the most centralized dictatorships, and even in foreign policy that is one of the most centralized areas of policy and governance. This is especially the case in China where Zhou Enlai, the major architect of CCP diplomacy, established the principle that “nothing is trivial in diplomacy” (外交无小事). This principle has been handed down in China from generation to generation. Any dispute, however trivial, may have profound implications on both foreign relations and, more importantly, on domestic politics. Xi Jinping’s “no-limit” support for Putin is not a trivial matter, especially because Putin has invaded Ukraine and caused the worst international crisis since the end of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Russian military venture faced international condemnation and even sanctions, and as its military actions reached a stalemate, Xi began to face criticism from among CCP elites. This is mainly because, in order to serve his own political ambitions and personal interests, Xi’s Russian/Ukrainian policies are damaging the long-term interests of the regime, i.e., to maintain a monopoly of power through economic development and global engagement. The leadership reorganization ahead of the forthcoming 20th Party Congress likely further intensifies such differences of opinion within the CCP regarding China’s stance on the Ukraine war, thus adding momentum to the struggle for power and especially to the elite resistance to Xi’s neo-Maoist political ambitions and governance programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the party principle that “nothing is trivial in diplomacy,” criticism over such a significant foreign policy issue has the potential to become a serious matter for the Chinese regime, especially when it has ramifications that challenge the authority, power, and even the position of the party chief. On the other hand, it is hard to imagine that Xi Jinping doesn’t well understand the significant implications of such criticism to his position, especially during this politically sensitive time period ahead to the 20the Party Congress. Are both Xi Jinping and the CCP elites playing a two-level game of public opinion to reduce the international pressures that Xi and the CCP regime are facing? Will Xi be undermined by such intra-elite differences regarding policy on Ukraine, or will he be able to overcome this elite resistance and even to make use of such differences to achieve his power goals? Events in the months that follow will be highly dynamic but they will have extremely low predictability. Regardless, this essay would highlight two concluding remarks drawn from the above analysis: first, Xi Jinping is under the pressure that comes mainly from CCP elites over his personal ambition of staying in power beyond the two-term limit, and his unpopular policies, including his “no-limit” stance of supporting Putin, have also become arenas of power struggle against his ambition; second, given the essence of CCP neo-totalitarian politics, even elite resistance and policy divergences can be manipulated to benefit the dictator. Analysts must refrain from reaching sweeping conclusions at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

My research finds that they see Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as setting limits to Sino-Russian relations, despite recent declarations by Beijing and Moscow stating otherwise. They conclude that China is likely to prioritize its own interests rather than to support Russia overtly. While some Russian observers emphasize the economic and political difficulties China faces, others point to its potential economic gains. Some Russian Asia experts remain confident that Russia will succeed in avoiding over-dependence on Chinese investment, whereas others see China being in a better position to obtain long-sought economic opportunities in Russia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China keeps reassuring Russia that their twenty-one-year–old Sino-Russian partnership remains strong. Two months after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, PRC Deputy Foreign Minister Le Yucheng told Russia’s Ambassador to China Andrei Denisov that the Chinese government will “continue to increase ‘strategic coordination’ with Russia despite “international volatility.” In the U.S. and Europe, China is seen as Russia’s tacit supporter, but what do Russian experts think? This is not easy to research given the severe penalties now in place in Russia for any critical discussion of Ukraine-related issues — up to 15 years in jail for spreading “fake news,” i.e., reports that go against the official views. Nevertheless, leading Russian experts on China and Asia have published a number of articles, some opting for social media, while others have been interviewed on blogs and in videos, providing some insights into their views. This article examines how these experts assess China’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its impact on Sino-Russian relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ukraine-in-russias-china-diplomacy&quot;&gt;Ukraine in Russia’s China Diplomacy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is considerable speculation in Washington and other capitals about the depth of PRC support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As Russia was amassing its troops along Ukraine’s borders, Russian President Vladimir Putin headed to Beijing where he and Xi signed a joint statement on February 4, 2022, outlining their shared views of international relations and sustainable development. The two strategic partners noted unspecified “serious international security challenges” and maintained that the security of states is interdependent. Ukraine is not mentioned in the text, but China stated that it “is sympathetic to and supports the proposal put forward by the Russian Federation to create legally binding security guarantees in Europe.” Professor Anna Kireeva of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) later comments that “What was really new was China’s support for Russia’s stance against NATO enlargement.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another innovation in this agreement, says Igor Denisov, senior research fellow at MGIMO, is the inclusion of language jointly opposing the intervention of external forces in “common adjacent regions.” Denisov points out that Ukraine and Belarus are not a common interest for Russia and China and therefore “deeper coordination” should not be expected. He adds that despite closer military ties, the two countries are not allies that coordinate their military moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did Putin apprise Xi in advance about his plans to invade Ukraine? Alexander Gabuev, a researcher currently based in Istanbul and a former senior fellow at the now shuttered Carnegie Moscow Center, tells The Financial Times he thinks this is highly unlikely. According to Gabuev, the decision to invade Ukraine was made on February 21, more than two weeks after Putin’s visit to Moscow. This resonates with conclusions of other experts, who portray Chinese officials as surprised by the Russian invasion. Moreover, the 6,000 Chinese nationals who were living in Ukraine were not told to evacuate, also lending credence to the belief by the Chinese government that if some Russian action were to be taken, it would not significantly harm China’s interests or nationals. Considering that Chinese officials also told their nationals to display the PRC flag to protect themselves, they appear to have assumed that whatever Russia planned to do in Ukraine would be successful and PRC nationals would be exempt from violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the invasion continued for a third month (and Chinese officials faced pressure from Western capitals to distance themselves from Russia), the Russian Foreign Ministry stated that Russia was “interested in seeing our relations with the People’s Republic of China continue to develop steadily and consistently. Together with you and with other like-minded people, we will move toward a multipolar, just, and democratic world order.” Gabuev contends that Putin and his circle believe that, based on a resurgent Russia and a rising China, “an unstoppable shift in power to authoritarian regimes” underpins this emerging order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when this new order appears more difficult than ever to achieve, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, recounts that at his first meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, since the Russian invasion began, “the two countries praised the current state of Russian-Chinese relations, which continue to develop dynamically in an unstable and tense foreign policy situation.” Their discussion, described as “traditionally confidential and friendly,” involved an exchange of views on Ukraine, and both foreign ministers “noted the counterproductive nature of the illegal unilateral sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and its satellites.” The Foreign Ministry statement concludes that, despite the “difficult international situation, Russia and China continue to strengthen their strategic partnership and act in world affairs from a unified position.” The two countries agreed to continue to develop their foreign policy coordination. Despite this trend, Georgy Zinoviev, director of the First Asia Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, warns that the Western countries are looking for “gaps” in relations between Russia and China in order to undermine their strategic partnership. He counters that, working with its Chinese friends, Russia will “neutralize the relevant efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-russian-scholars-assess-chinas-position-on-ukraine&quot;&gt;How Russian Scholars Assess China’s Position on Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their analyses, Russian scholars emphasize the difficulties confronting China in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Professor Alexander Lukin of the Higher School of Economics argues that Chinese leaders face a conundrum — Russia is important to China as a geopolitical ally against perceived U.S. pressure and as a supplier of energy and mineral resources, and Sino-Russian relations are the closest they have been in years. Yet he also notes that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is problematic for Beijing because it blurs the lines it seeks to draw about “the fundamental difference between the aggressive, hegemonic policies of the United States and its allies” that disrespect state sovereignty and territorial integrity and about what PRC officials depict as “the peace-loving line of China and its friend Russia, directed toward peaceful co-existence and constructive cooperation with everyone, including the West.” Lukin adds that China also faces possible economic costs from the invasion due to the threat of counter-sanctions and rising energy prices. Moreover, Russia would have less value as a strategic partner if it were to emerge from the invasion in a weakened position vis-à-vis the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Gabuev, China’s number one concern is not friendship with Russia — it is Chinese interests. “China cares about the interests of China,” he tells The Financial Times. Although the Sino-Russian partnership supports Chinese interests, Gabuev contends that Beijing hopes to avoid collateral damage to its relations with the West. He also claims that, while Beijing feigns equidistance, PRC officials tailor their statements on Ukraine to a particular audience. Gabuev sees China scrupulously respecting sanctions against Russia, “but after the war is over, China will come in and see what contracts will be available on the cheap.” He further notes that the West’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine has demonstrated that there is real collective will to punish an aggressor. Consequently, the PRC will double down to acquire the technology it needs and will become more self-sufficient economically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other observers see different views in the PRC about the Russian invasion. Vladimir Soskyrev, a journalist who has covered China for many years, observes that even on censored Chinese social media, it is possible to find criticism of official PRC positions supporting Russia. He mentions that one post on Ukrainian blood donors received 62 million views and another by a Chinese author who states that “war is no joke” received 60,000 likes. Similar to Lukin, Soskyrev notes that China seeks to balance its partnership with Russia with its traditional claim to support state sovereignty. He points out that Chinese media have been directed not to criticize Russia, thus providing more context for the PRC’s apparent support for the Russian positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan Zuenko, a senior research fellow at MGIMO and a Vladivostok-based analyst, agrees that there are multiple views about Ukraine in China. Zuenko sees the dominant view holding that China’s main goal should be to remain neutral and avoid breaking partnerships with any countries, while also refusing to openly join an anti-Russian front. Zuenko finds a pro-Western view in China that is extremely critical of Chinese support for Russian positions on Ukraine and is urging the country to engage more with the West and to stop decoupling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ukraine-and-sino-russian-relations&quot;&gt;Ukraine and Sino-Russian Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian experts on China and international relations are well aware that their country’s invasion of Ukraine will have repercussions for Russia’s relations with China. Even Sergei Karaganov, an adviser to Putin and Lavrov who has pressed for closer ties with China, a partnership that he characterizes as almost allied, acknowledges that “China’s economic influence in Russia and over Russia will grow.” Dmitri Trenin, former director of the Moscow Carnegie Center, who previously was believed to hold more pro-Western positions on foreign policy, now sees Asian and Middle Eastern states as Russia’s key partners. In early April 2022, he wrote: “Russia will have to rely more than ever on the countries of the East for the foreseeable future — primarily on China, but also on India and, if possible, on other countries of Asia and the Middle East.” Just prior to the Russian invasion, however, Trenin spoke of natural limits and asymmetries between Russia and China, contending that Putin — and indeed most Russian people — were seeking to avoid Russian dependence on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Russian scholars see Russia’s invasion of Ukraine setting limits to the Sino-Russian partnership, despite official displays of mutual support. Kireeva writes that “As Moscow and Beijing feel pressure from the West, simultaneously they tend to be more supportive of each other. Yet this falls short of transforming the relationship into something more formal.” She sees greater interoperability of forces emerging without any alliance obligations — China wants to maintain its economic ties to the West despite Russia’s conflict with NATO, and similarly Russia wants to pursue its Asian interests while remaining neutral if China were to enter into a conflict with its neighbors. Ivan Timofeev of the Russian International Affairs Council agrees that “China will keep its distance and free hand,” and it will be more concerned with its own economic security given the unprecedented Western sanctions against Russia than it will be with creating any type of alliance with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to a shared perception of Western pressure, many factors underpin the Sino-Russian partnership. Gabuev emphasizes that domestic drivers are equally important, including the two countries’ long shared border with its history of confrontation, economic complementarities, their common political choice of authoritarianism and shared concerns about sovereignty, as well as the increasing personalized nature of their regimes. Even though Gabuev sees the Sino-Russian partnership as very solid, he also believes that China views Putin’s actions in Ukraine as irrational. Nevertheless, Gabuev argues that China is unlikely to pressure Russia to stop the war because Chinese leaders so dislike being lectured. Moreover, Gabuev states that if U.S. President Joe Biden failed to convince Putin, then Xi will be even less likely to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Russian China scholars point to fundamental differences between Russian and Chinese positions. Denisov points out, for example, that while China has been echoing Russian positions on Ukraine, Chinese media have doubled down on the strategic narrative about Ukraine as a conflict between Russia and NATO, but they have largely avoided engaging with Russia’s portrayal of the domestic situation in eastern Ukraine and the nature of the Ukrainian regime, which Putin claims to justify his invasion. Denisov contends that “Chinese silence can hardly be seen as tacit agreement with Russian talking points — rather the opposite. This is where the division between the positions of Moscow and Beijing runs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lukin also sees some daylight between Chinese and Russian positions. He argues that China considers Russia’s reaction to perceived threats in Ukraine to be excessive. Lukin points to a statement by PRC Foreign Minister Wang Yi, at a meeting with SCO Secretary General Zhang Ming on March 17, in which Wang criticizes the policies that led to the bloc confrontation, and violations of the UN Charter and principles of international justice, without naming the countries involved. To Lukin, this amounts to indirect criticism of Russia. “Chinese officials formulate their position in such a way that criticism of power politics can be attributed not only to the United States and NATO but also to other states, including Russia,” he argues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many observers in the West have noted that China’s support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will raise questions about Beijing’s long-held positions on sovereignty and territorial integrity that are so important for its core interest in Taiwan reunification. Lukin emphasizes that Chinese officials constantly reject comparisons between Ukraine and Taiwan not only because of its own concerns about Taiwan but also because China sees itself as a leader of the developing world that has long faced challenges about territorial integrity. Denisov agrees with the characterization of China’s concern over territorial integrity and finds it unlikely that China will recognize the republics of eastern Ukraine. However, he also cautions that to the extent that the Black Sea region becomes an arena for strategic competition, China will be more amenable to supporting Russian positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Gabuev’s view, since the Russian annexation of Crimea China has developed a “template” for reacting to Russia’s irrational views. This involves criticizing NATO expansion and U.S.-led alliances, but as civilian casualties mount, it also involves adding some language expressing sympathy for the Ukrainian people,. Chinese officials want to avoid the “strategic nightmare” scenarios of an unstable or pro-Western Russia, while also preventing China’s own economic relationship with the West from unraveling. There is no contradiction in Chinese positions on non-interference — Gabuev emphasizes that “For China, non-interference means non-interference in China’s affairs. China itself interferes in the affairs of its neighbors all the time. …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-next-moves&quot;&gt;China’s Next Moves&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese officials and experts occasionally float the possibility that their country might mediate between Russia and Ukraine, but Soskyrev emphasizes that China is really just trying to avoid becoming drawn into the conflict. China tried to appear neutral, for example, by publishing back-to-back interviews, reported by Xinhua without comment, with the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers on April 30, in which they each had an opportunity to outline their country’s position. Lavrov thanks the Chinese government for its “balanced approach,” which Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Dmytro Kuleba did not highlight — he limited his gratitude to China’s diplomatic efforts and position against escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian observers generally do not foresee China providing any direct support to Moscow. Gabuev dismisses Western speculation about Chinese military assistance as an effort to put pressure on Beijing and any material received now will simply reflect contracts concluded prior to the invasion. Kireeva concurs that there are no “signs of direct support” apart from statements blaming the U.S. — she sees China trying “to avoid endorsing or condemning Moscow’s actions by highlighting a peaceful resolution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Russian experts tend to see China’s behavior as largely self-serving, especially on economic matters. Gabuev recounts how Russian officials were disappointed that China was not willing to “deliver as much as Russia had hoped for” after the first invasion of Ukraine in 2014, but it then became reconciled to China prioritizing its own interests, just as Russia does. In April 2022, facing new obstacles to Xi’s signature Belt and Road Initiative, such as impeding transiting the New Eurasian Landbridge via Russia and Belarus, China opted for a southern route from Xian to Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, via the Black Sea to Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and concluding in Mannheim, Germany. Pravda, formerly the official Soviet Communist Party newspaper, adds:“And this route will bypass Russia.” After criticism that its DJI drones used by Ukraine were secretly supplying intelligence to Russia, the Chinese company suspended sales to both Russia and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian scholars argue that China will seek to navigate the threat of secondary sanctions, but given that some of its own companies already face U.S. sanctions, China may look for opportunities opened up by the departure of Western firms. A Chinese auto group is in talks to acquire Renault’s 68 percent stake in Russia’s AutoVAZ company, for example. The pullout from Russia of Western firms, such as Renault, Toyota, BMW, Volkswagen, and Hyundai, which all halted production in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, also gives Chinese car producers an opportunity to increase their market share in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies may find that the best deals will be in the energy sector, though investing in downstream production may be easier than financing and building any new pipelines. As Timofeev argues, there are many upsides for China in the current situation, including lower prices for Russian energy. Nevertheless, under guidance from the PRC Foreign Ministry, Chinese energy majors — China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), and Sinopec — have been urged to exercise caution in their investments in Russia. We already have seen Sinopec withdraw from a new $500 million venture with SIBUR, a major Russian petrochemical company that is partly owned by sanctioned oligarch Gennady Timchenko. However, these same Chinese companies are exploring purchasing the stake Shell is vacating — its 27.5 percent stake in the Sakhalin-2 liquid natural gas (LNG) project, which is 50 percent owned by Russian state-owned gas company Gazprom. Sanctions prevent the Russian firm from accessing new financing, but the company itself is not facing sanctions. Japan has thus far retained its stakes in Sakhalin energy companies, fearing that selling them would harm its own energy security and would add money to the Russian treasury and would benefit China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow State University scholar Alexei Maslov argues that the Chinese government has not yet decided on its policy on economic ties with Russia. In Maslov’s view, the war will need to end and then Russia will have to discuss its economic needs and positions with China. He adds, “Of course, China is waiting for special offers. And these special offers should be fundamentally different from what we previously did in the economic sphere. I believe that at least until the end of the year, there may be complex and lengthy negotiations between Moscow and Beijing on this issue.” Maslov suggests that such discussions might involve tax benefits for Chinese investments and more Chinese production in Russia, though he states that Russia should be a co-investor, not just a purchaser, of Chinese goods and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian scholars are well aware that their country risks greater financial dependence and a more asymmetrical partnership with China. Zuenko cautions that there is no need to trade one type of dependence for another. He reminds us that China failed to receive special privileges in the aftermath of the sanctions imposed on Russia in 2014 as a result of its annexation of Crimea. In Zuenko’s view, Chinese officials believe that since then Russia has benefited more from China than China has benefited from Russia. Zuenko argues that it is easier for other countries to do business in Russia, and going forward, there is unlikely to be a major change in Sino-Russian relations beyond more Chinese goods in Russian shops. According to Zuenko, “It is likely that two or three flagship projects, like Yamal-LNG, will be implemented. However, there will be no mass attraction of Chinese investors on the special conditions that China hopes for. …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding projects in the Arctic like the Yamal LNG ventures, Gabuev agrees that China “will fill the void and find a way to be even more present, and Russia will not be able to push back.” While Russia has jealously guarded its prerogatives as an Arctic coastal state and has been wary of China’s Arctic ambitions, China succeeded in expanding its investments in the Russian Arctic after 2014. This may be more difficult to achieve in 2022 due to the much greater reputational costs for Chinese involvement in the Russian Arctic — the region’s only governance body, the Arctic Council, which China fought hard to join as an observer — suspended its operations in protest against the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Moreover, Novatek, a Russian independent gas producer which now faces sanctions, may be unable to secure financing to move forward with its second Yamal LNG project, in which Chinese energy companies CNPC and CNOOC each already have a 10 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;china-and-russias-asia-pivot&quot;&gt;China and Russia’s Asia Pivot&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, Russia has sought to pivot to Asia and take better advantage of its geographic position astride both the European and Asian continents. In particular, Russian strategists have long hoped to become a “swing” supplier of energy resources to Asia as well as to Europe. As Western countries now aim to wean themselves off Russian oil and gas, the pivot to Asia is becoming a necessity, but Russian experts urge looking beyond the Chinese market. Maslov has suggested reaching out to a number of Asian countries, especially longstanding partners like India and Vietnam, with incentives for trade and investment in Russia. The Indian government, for example, has already urged its state-owned oil company, UVL, to explore purchasing the 30 percent stake in the Sakhalin 1 LNG project that ExxonMobil is vacating. Zuenko notes that Russia’s Asia pivot has never been only about China — previously Japan and South Korea were important as well as India and Southeast Asia. Moreover, despite the geostrategic factors and strong energy ties, Zuenko argues that it will take time to expand economic cooperation with China due to logistics problems in Russia, political inertia, and cultural barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin already has commissioned plans for rerouting Russia’s energy infrastructure eastward and for developing additional pipelines to better supply Asian markets as well as to supply potential energy customers in Africa and the Middle East. This might involve expanding the capacity of the East Siberian Pacific Ocean oil pipeline and moving forward with the Power of Siberia gas pipeline that will traverse Mongolia en route to China (which has yet to agree on the routing). However, such projects will take years to complete as will commitments from purchasers to buy the energy, not to mention financing, which will be difficult to obtain due to the sanctions. As of March 2022, Europe had purchased 50 percent of Russian oil and 75 percent of its gas. Coal is the only energy resource Russia currently sends more to Asia than it sends to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Gabuev’s view, China’s growing leverage over Russia is likely to complicate Moscow’s plans for an Asia pivot that is not exclusively focused on China. He contends that if China gains more leverage over Russia, and Russia fails to stabilize its relationship with the Western countries, then China will be in a position to dictate political terms to Russia, for example, insisting that it cease arms sales to India, calling for the most sophisticated Russian weapons systems, or requiring that the renminbi be used as the official currency for Sino-Russian trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite speculation about an authoritarian convergence between Moscow and Beijing and rhetoric about a Sino-Russian partnership without limits, Russian China-watchers see Russia’s invasion of Ukraine constraining China’s support for Russia. Having had nearly a decade to assess China’s response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine in 2014, they largely conclude that China is likely to prioritize its own interests rather than to back Russia overtly. Russian China experts highlight the competing interests Chinese policymakers confront as they seek to prevent a further weakening of Russia to the benefit of the West, while also aiming to minimize damage to Chinese economic interests and the PRC’s global reputation. While some Russian observers emphasize the difficulties China faces in navigating the situation, others point to the potential gains — greater economic and even political leverage over an economically vulnerable Russia and diminished Western pressure on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Russian Asia experts are convinced that Russia will succeed in avoiding over-dependence on Chinese investment, especially in traditionally sensitive areas like the Russian Far East and the Arctic, while others see China in a better position to obtain long-sought economic opportunities. Most agree that one unintended consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine is that Russia’s Asia pivot — discussed since the days of Peter the Great, but yet to be fully implemented — will need to become a reality, especially if the European countries finally succeed in disconnecting themselves from Russian energy flows. As some Russian observers note, this will provide new opportunities not only for China but also for other Asian countries, especially Russia’s other partners, India and Vietnam. Some U.S. partners, such as Japan and South Korea, will face tradeoffs between supporting Western sanctions and forfeiting to China their investments in the Russian energy sector and in the Russian Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russia has failed to achieve most of its objectives in Ukraine because of poor military planning, significant logistical problems, low combat readiness, and other deficiencies, which undermined Russian military effectiveness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt;&lt;em&gt;These and other challenges — including Ukrainian military efforts and Western aid — severely impacted Russian air, ground, cyber, and maritime operations. Russia’s failures will force the Russian military to fundamentally rethink its training practices, organizational structure, culture, logistics, recruitment and retention policies, and planning efforts. Nevertheless, Russia is still attempting a de facto annexation of parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that it controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis examines lessons from Russian air, ground, cyber, and other domains following Moscow’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. It asks: What are some of the most important military lessons from the first three months of the war? What do these lessons suggest about the future of the war? The assessment focuses predominantly on the operational level of warfare, especially the planning and conduct of the military campaign. The operational level links the tactical utilization of forces to strategic objectives and includes such aspects as fire and maneuver, logistics, intelligence, command and control, and planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer the main questions, this analysis relied on several types of information. One included collecting and analyzing primary and secondary sources on the war, including military and intelligence assessments from Western countries. Another was a force disposition map of the battlefield, in which CSIS analysts compiled and assessed Russian and Ukrainian tactical and operational activity. The final involved background interviews with Western government officials and other subject matter experts. While the war in Ukraine is likely far from over, this analysis comes to several initial conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the Russian military faced considerable logistics challenges, in part because of poor training and planning. During the Russian push to Kyiv in the early phase of the war, for example, Russian ground forces faced massive logistical and command and control challenges operating in contested areas inside of Ukraine. Without access to rail transport and with roads clogged with Russian vehicles, Russian ground forces failed to move fuel, munitions, spare parts, and other matériel quickly and efficiently to forward-deployed units. Supply lines could not keep up with the long combat pushes, and logistics vehicles were not properly protected. The effectiveness of Russian long-range strike — a key aspect of Russian military operations — was also severely impacted by logistical challenges, including an insufficient supply of precision-guided munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Russian ground offensive appears to have been planned and executed based on poor assumptions about how the Ukrainian military — and the population — would respond, as well as how the West might react. Seizing and holding territory was a major political objective of Russian policymakers. But controlling territory in a foreign country with a hostile Ukrainian population was deeply problematic for the Russian military, particularly since the conflict began to resemble a “people’s war.” In addition, Russian forces failed to effectively integrate combined arms to seize and hold Ukrainian territory, including coordination between land power, air power, and long-range fires. The Russian invasion force was also far too small to achieve its objectives and neglected to block Ukraine’s western border and prevent the supply of foreign weapons, systems, fuel, and other aid to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Russian offensive cyber operations and electronic warfare failed to blind Ukrainian command and control efforts or threaten critical infrastructure for a prolonged period. Russian military and intelligence agencies conducted cyberattacks and utilized electronic warfare against Ukrainian targets, including destructive cyberattacks on hundreds of Ukrainian government and critical infrastructure systems. But these attacks did not notably impact the Ukrainian will or ability to fight or communicate. Ukraine was able to blunt most of the effects of these cyberattacks through an aggressive cyber defense, with help from private companies, Western governments, and other state and non-state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this brief is organized into three sections. It begins by providing an update on the war, including a tactical map of Russian and Ukrainian force disposition. The brief then focuses on Russian challenges in several domains of warfare. It concludes with policy implications for the United States and its Western allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;setting-the-stage-an-evolving-front&quot;&gt;Setting the Stage: An Evolving Front&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the initial phase of the war, Russian ground forces invaded on four main fronts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Northern Front:&lt;/strong&gt; Russian forces pushed toward Kyiv from Belarus, led by units from the Eastern Military District, including the 29th, 35th, and 36th Combined Arms Armies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Northeastern Front:&lt;/strong&gt; Russian forces moved west toward Kyiv from Russian territory, led by units from the Central Military District, including the 41st Combined and 2nd Guards Combined Arms Armies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eastern Front:&lt;/strong&gt; Russian forces pushed toward Kharkiv and out of the Donbas, led by units from the Western Military District, including the 1st Guards Tank Army and 20th and 6th Combined Arms Armies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Southern Front:&lt;/strong&gt; Russian forces moved from Crimea west toward Odesa, north toward Zaporizhzhia, and east toward Mariupol. They were led by units from the Southern Military District, including the 58th, 49th, and 8th Combined Arms Armies, VDV’s 7th Air Assault Division, and VDV’s 11th Air Assault Brigade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After suffering a series of setbacks that are highlighted later in this analysis, the Russian military began to withdraw forces from Kyiv around April 2022 and concentrate its efforts on eastern and southern Ukraine. Today, the distinctive feature of the war is a roughly 600-mile front that extends just west of Kherson along the Black Sea; moves east through Melitopol, Mariupol, and other southern cities; cuts northeast through the Donbas in eastern Ukraine, including the cities of Luhansk and Donetsk; continues northwest near Izyum; and then intersects the Russian border north of Kharkiv. Figure 1 highlights the force disposition by early June 2022. Russia deployed roughly 110 Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs) in Ukraine for a total of approximately 142,000 forces; utilized irregular forces, including militias from Donetsk and Luhansk; dug trenches and placed mines at and near the lines of contact; and constructed rail lines and repaired bridges and roads to improve Russian lines of communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control of territory will continue to ebb and flow around these lines, including around such areas as the Donbas. In addition, Russian ships in the Black Sea have conducted a naval blockade of Ukraine, halting commerce at Ukrainian ports, and struck Ukrainian targets with cruise missiles and other stand-off weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has attempted to annex some of this territory through a crude form of state-building. It has forcibly deported — or, in some cases, tortured and executed — pro-Ukrainian civilians and encouraged ethnic Russians (and pro-Russian civilians) to remain. Russia has also replaced Ukrainian government officials with hand-picked, pro-Russian officials. For instance, Moscow appointed Volodymyr Saldo, a former mayor of Kherson, as head of the Kherson regional military-civilian administration. In May, he announced that the area “will become the Kherson region of the Russian Federation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/220601_Jones_Russia%27s_Ill-Fated_Invasion_Map_WEB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Russian and Ukrainian Force Disposition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian state-building covers a broad swath of economic, cultural, nationalist, governance, and security measures. Moscow has replaced the Ukrainian currency, the hryvnia, with the Russian ruble in such cities as Melitopol. It has taken control of critical infrastructure, such as nuclear power plants and steel plants, and rerouted internet through Russia. In addition, Russia has issued newly married couples with Russian Federation wedding certificates. Russian flags now fly at numerous government buildings, while Ukrainian flags have been taken down and Ukrainian symbols have been removed from buildings and repainted. Russia is creating Russian-language schools and revising the education system — including the curriculum — in these areas, as Moscow attempts to reeducate locals in Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine. Russian military, intelligence, and police officials have penetrated cities and villages, rounding up and detaining protesters and pro-Ukrainian sympathizers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Russia, annexation of these areas is a fait accompli. “It’s out of the question to return the Kherson region back to Nazi Ukraine,” said Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-appointed deputy head of the military-civil administration of Kherson region. “Kyiv will no longer be able to force its ugly Nazi policies upon our land.” Sergei Aksyonov, the head of the Republic of Crimea, similarly indicated that the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions would be annexed. And Russia’s deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin remarked that the Kherson region will take “a worthy place in our Russian family.” To expand Russia’s control of territory, the Russian military is likely to continue its attrition campaign in eastern and southern Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-military-failures&quot;&gt;Russian Military Failures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia failed to achieve what was likely its main political objective: to overthrow the Kyiv government in a blitzkrieg military operation. The Russian military also faced significant challenges seizing and holding territory. These problems contributed to the suspension or firing of several senior military officials, such as Lieutenant General Serhiy Kisel, commander of the 1st Guards Tank Army, for dereliction during the offensive against Kharkiv; Lieutenant General Vlaislav Yershov, commander of the 6th Combined Arms Army, for failing to capture Kharkiv; and Vice Admiral Igor Osipov, commander of the Black Sea Fleet, following the sinking of the flagship cruiser Moskva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, roughly a dozen Russian generals and other senior officials were killed on the battlefield, such as Lieutenant General Andrei Mordvichev, Lieutenant General Yakov Rezantsev, Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky, Major General Vitaly Gerasimov, Major General Kanamat Botashev, Major General Andrey Kolesnikov, and Major General Oleg Mityaev. These firings and deaths may have exacerbated command and control problems that the Russian military was already experiencing. In an effort to improve overall command and control of Russian operations, particularly air-ground integration, Russian president Vladimir Putin appointed General Aleksandr Dvornikov to oversee military operations in April. Still, Russia continued to experience command and control challenges during its offensive operations in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts in May and June 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this section examines Russian difficulties in the air, ground, and cyber domains of warfare. It also highlights Russian challenges in other domains, such as maritime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Russian air operations in Ukraine have been characterized by a heavy focus on long-range strike against Ukrainian military and civilian targets to undermine the Ukrainian military’s ability to wage war, weaken morale of the Ukrainian population, and punish the country for its shift toward the West. Over the previous several years, Russia had developed command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems on the battlefield, providing data to enable a higher throughput of airstrikes. These systems were integrated into Russia’s overarching systems of “reconnaissance strike complexes” — which were designed for the coordinated employment of high-precision, long-range weapons linked to real-time intelligence data and accurate targeting. As General Valery Gerasimov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, remarked, “The principal features of future conflicts will be the extensive employment of precision weapons and other types of new weapons.” To identify targets in a relatively contested environment, the Russian military also utilized some airborne platforms, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early phases of the war, Russia aimed to pin down Ukrainian air defenses around the country by conducting ballistic and cruise missile strikes across the country, including Kh-101 cruise missiles deployed from Tu-95 Bear and Tu-160 Blackjack bombers flying in Russian and Belarusian airspace. The Russian air force then expanded its target list to include Ukrainian military infrastructure, arms shipments from the West, fuel facilities, bridges, and even civilian targets. Russia launched more than 1,100 missiles at Ukrainian targets over the first 21 days of the war and a total of 2,125 missiles over the first 68 days of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the Russian military faced numerous challenges in conducting its air campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the Russian air force failed to achieve air superiority against a Ukrainian military with notable air defense capabilities, such as Stinger man-portable air-defense systems, S-300 surface-to-air missile systems, and other systems — thanks, in part, to Western aid. The success of Ukrainian air defenses deterred Russian aircraft from freely operating over most of Ukrainian-controlled territory. This meant that one of Russia’s primary ways to strike deep into Ukraine was through cruise missiles launched from Russia, Belarus, and maritime vessels in the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Russian air force faced recurring logistics challenges, including running low on stocks of long-range, precision-guided munitions. Three weeks into the war, for example, the Russian air force began to run low on precision-guided munitions, such as laser- and satellite-guided bombs, which caused the Russians to use a growing number of unguided artillery shells, rockets, and missiles from the ground forces. When it came to weapons systems such as the Iskander-M short-range ballistic missile system, the Russian military was also hesitant to expend a portion of its stockpile, which it needed for defense against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other threats. In addition, dozens of Russian UAVs, such as the Orlan-10, Orlan-20, Orlan-30, Eleron-3, and Forpost, were shot down on the battlefield or subject to electronic jamming. These challenges were exacerbated by the inability of Russia’s domestic arms industry to replace these UAVs quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the long run, Russia may face a supply chain challenge because of U.S. and other Western sanctions. For example, the 9M729 cruise missile, which is fired from the Iskander-K short-range ballistic missile system, is one of the Russian military’s most advanced weapons systems with precision-strike capabilities. The cruise missile has roughly a half dozen socket attachment points that permit data to move through the heat shield. Some of these socket attachment points were manufactured by U.S. companies. In addition, the rails that affixed the circuit boards to the computer housing — as well as the circuit boards — were manufactured by U.S. companies. The 9M949 300 mm rocket, which is used in Russia’s Tornado-S multiple rocket launcher system, also used a fiber-optic gyroscope manufactured in the United States. Finally, the Russian TOR-M2 air-defense system utilized an oscillator designed in the United Kingdom, which is located in the computer that controls the radar. These supply chain challenges will likely impact Russia’s short- and long-term supply of components to conduct stand-off attacks, forcing Russia to look for substitute markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges undermined Moscow’s attempt to establish air dominance over Ukraine, conduct effective precision strikes, and support advancing Russian ground forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; In the initial phase of the war, Russian forces along the northern front relied on the roads to avoid Ukraine’s marshes and forests. While the advantage in numbers, artillery, and cannon fire from armored vehicles allowed Russian forces to quickly advance toward Kyiv, Ukrainian forces inflicted significant casualties using anti-tank ambushes. As Russian forces moved through Ukrainian villages and towns, local civilians provided intelligence on their location and movement, while Ukrainian special forces and UAVs marked targets for artillery. As Figure 2 highlights, many of Russia’s vehicles were marked with a “Z” to delineate that they were from the Russian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/220601_KhersonAirbase_imagery_2_updated.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Russian Army Vehicles with Invasion “Z” Markings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk of Russian ground forces is composed of BTGs, which are combined arms units typically drawn from companies and battalions in existing brigades. While the structure of BTGs varies somewhat based on operational needs and available personnel, most include roughly 600 to 800 soldiers — and, in Ukraine, perhaps closer to 600 soldiers. They are generally mechanized battalions, with two to four tank or mechanized infantry companies and attached artillery, reconnaissance, engineer, electronic warfare, and rear support platoons — including motor transport, field mess, vehicle recovery, maintenance, and hygiene squads. The result in theory is a fairly self‑sufficient ground combat unit with fire and rear support. In practice, the BTGs were likely understrength and lacked sufficient infantry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Russian ground forces encountered serious problems in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the Russian army faced significant logistical and maintenance challenges operating in contested areas inside of Ukraine. Russia’s approach to combined arms warfare was generally to hammer Ukrainian positions with artillery and other stand-off weapons and then to send armored vehicles forward on a maneuver termed “reconnaissance to contact,” designed to overwhelm what remained of Ukrainian defensive lines. But because of the Ukrainian military’s effective use of anti-armor munitions, such as anti-tank guided missiles and loitering munitions, Russian ground forces had difficulty advancing and seizing ground. This was true even when the speed of some Russian armored units allowed them to push into Kyiv’s suburbs only 48 hours into the war. Some of these Russian units were isolated with limited or no logistics, miles ahead of the main body of Russian ground units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian army also operated with fewer support soldiers than many other militaries. Roughly 150 of the troops in a BTG could be considered support, which is notably lower than some militaries such as the U.S. Army, which deploys approximately 10 support soldiers for every combat soldier. Without access to rail transport that usually moves Russian heavy equipment, and with the few roads available clogged with traffic, it became increasingly difficult for the Russian army to move food, fuel, munitions, spare parts, and other supplies to forward-deployed forces. These problems were compounded by the Russian army’s failure to provide convoy security to logistics vehicles, such as those carrying food, water, medical supplies, mobile kitchens, fuel, engineers, and spare parts. Forward-deployed Russian vehicles broke down, and many had to be abandoned because of a lack of spare parts, mechanics, and recovery vehicles. In short, the Russian army failed to secure its critical lines of communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian advance to Kyiv, for instance, came at an increasingly heavy price. By the time Russian forces had secured Hostomel Airport in late February 2022 and were in place to launch an attack on Kyiv, they lacked the combat power to seize the city. Russian forces came into range of Ukrainian artillery units and exposed more of their depth to raiding. Russian forces also ran into numerous logistical challenges in their failed effort to seize and hold the city of Kharkiv. Bans by the West on the export of sensitive technologies to Russia could also cut into Moscow’s ability to prosecute a protracted ground war. Two of Russia’s largest tank manufactures, for example, were forced to halt production because of a lack of parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Russian invasion force was far too small to seize and hold territory, particularly with a Ukrainian population that rose up against the Russian military in a variation of what the Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong referred to as a “people’s war.” As Mao wrote in his book On Protracted War, “the richest source of power to wage war lies in the masses of the people.” Mao argued that in a well-organized resistance effort, the invading force “will be surrounded by hundreds of millions of our people standing upright . . . and he will be burned to death.” Russia utilized between 150,000 and 190,000 soldiers — including regular and irregular forces — for the initial invasion of Ukraine, a country of approximately 44 million people with an area of over 600,000 square kilometers. Those numbers translate into a force ratio of 4 Russian soldiers per 1,000 Ukrainian inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no exact formulas for how many soldiers are required to hold conquered territory, but a force ratio of as many as 20 soldiers per 1,000 inhabitants has sometimes been necessary to pacify a hostile local population. Large numbers of troops are generally essential to establish basic law and order. By the end of World War II, for example, there were 101 U.S. soldiers per 1,000 inhabitants in the U.S.-controlled sector of Germany. More recently, there were 19 U.S. and European soldiers per 1,000 inhabitants in Bosnia in 1995 and 20 soldiers per 1,000 inhabitants in Kosovo in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower ratios are generally insufficient to pacify hostile populations. In Iraq, for instance, the United States had 7 soldiers per 1,000 inhabitants and faced a persistent deadly insurgency — even with the help of Iraqi government forces and Sunni militia members. U.S. Army chief of staff General Eric K. Shinseki warned Congress in February 2003 that “several hundred thousand” troops would likely be needed to secure postwar Iraq. In Afghanistan, the United States had only 1 soldier per 1,000 inhabitants, along with the help of Afghan National Security Forces. With such small numbers, the United States and its NATO allies faced a prolonged insurgency that led to the overthrow of the Afghan government in 2021. The force ratio of Russian soldiers in Ukraine was far too small to hold territory — including cities — for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The low ratio was also problematic because of the substantial number of conscripts deployed to Ukraine, who were ineffective and suffered from poor morale. Russian conscripts are generally prohibited from serving in military operations abroad except when Moscow formally declares war, unless they volunteer as soldiers. Still, their compulsory service typically lasts for only a year, and conscripts have generally not been effective fighters. Russian soldiers were given limited advanced notice that they were going to invade Ukraine, undermining readiness and logistics planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Russian forces failed to conduct basic maneuver warfare against Ukrainian forces, preferring instead to bombard Ukrainian cities and villages in a war of attrition. Problems on the ground were complicated by Russia’s broader failure to conduct an effective combined arms campaign and to synchronize effects. Russia’s challenges raised serious questions about its competence in fire and maneuver. For example, where were the Russian infantry that were supposed to target Ukrainian ambushes? Where was the fire from artillery, mortars, and close air support that was supposed to suppress Ukrainian anti-tank guided munitions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the challenge may have been poor leadership within the Russian army and a highly centralized Russian command and control structure that lacked a professional corps of noncommissioned officers. There were also signs of declining professionalism in the Russian officer corps, including prohibiting drivers from evacuating wounded Russian soldiers to preserve military equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality of Ukrainian forces was a major change from Syria, where Russia, Syria, Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah, and militia units from Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestinian territory, and other areas faced a relatively weak mix of insurgents. Russian mechanized formations in northern Ukraine were targeted by lethal Ukrainian light infantry armed with modern weapon systems, such as the Javelin anti-tank missile system, Next Generation Light Anti-Tank Weapon (NLAW), and Stugna-P anti-tank guided-missile system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian attacks during Russia’s initial advance also made the Russians unwilling to push sensitive electronic warfare and air-defense systems into Ukraine in case they were captured. Consequently, Russia had to back off on its electronic suppression of Ukrainian radar and communications. Senior Russian officers began to deploy forward, where they became targets for snipers and artillery strikes. In addition, Russian forces encountered numerous command and control problems, including a paucity of secure communications, which undermined their ability to synchronize and coordinate attacks. Russian soldiers frequently used unencrypted communications — including civilian cell phones — which allowed Ukrainian intelligence and military units to target them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian difficulties in seizing territory created problems in the maritime domain. On April 13, for example, Ukrainian forces struck the RTS Moskva, a guided-missile cruiser that was the flagship vessel of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, with Neptune anti-ship missiles. The Russian navy lost several other ships to Ukrainian stand-off attacks, including the RTS Saratov, an Alligator-class landing ship; two Raptor-class patrol boats; and a Serna-class landing craft. Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 UAVs apparently sank the patrol boats and landing craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber and Space Challenges:&lt;/strong&gt; Russia conducted multiple cyber operations, including cyberattacks and espionage operations, in concert with Russian land, air, and maritime attacks. A day before the military invasion, for example, cyberattackers associated with the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) launched destructive wiper attacks on hundreds of systems in the Ukrainian government and in Ukraine’s energy, information technology, media, and financial sectors. Russia’s goal was likely to undermine Ukraine’s political will, weaken Ukraine’s ability to fight, and collect intelligence that Russia could use to gain tactical, operational, and strategic advantages. Over the next several weeks, Russian actors linked to the GRU, Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and Federal Security Service (FSB) conducted numerous cyberattacks utilizing such malware families as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WhisperGate / Whisper/Kill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The worst outcome for Ukraine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FoxBlade (or Hermetic Wiper)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SonicVote (or HermeticRansom)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CaddyWiper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DesertBlade&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Industroyer2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lasainraw (or IsaacWiper)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FiberLake (or DoubleZero)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of malware are designed to do a range of malicious activities, such as overwriting data and rendering machines unbootable, deleting data, and destroying — or attempting to destroy — critical infrastructure, such as industrial production and processes. Russian-linked hackers used a range of common intrusion techniques, such as exploiting public-facing web-based applications, sending spear phishing e-mails with attachments or links, and stealing credentials and using valid e-mail accounts. Over the first month and a half of the war, more than 40 percent of Russia’s destructive cyberattacks were aimed at Ukrainian critical infrastructure sectors, while another 32 percent targeted Ukrainian government sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also conducted an electronic warfare campaign against Ukrainian forces. Over the previous few years, Russia had invested heavily in electronic warfare systems capable of shutting down communications and signals across a broad spectrum. This capability is grouped under the concept of the Radio Electronic Battery. In the early morning of February 24, 2022, for example, Russia jammed Ukrainian air defense radar across all frequency bands. Russian E95M UAVs, which simulated Russian aircraft, harassed Ukrainian radar to draw out their air defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, cyber was largely a bust for Russia in the war. The Russian military faced considerable operational challenges, in part because of outside state and non-state assistance to Ukraine to identify cyber and electronic warfare attacks, attribute the perpetrators, and assist with remediation. Some Western governments, including U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, provided help to the Ukrainian government. As General Paul Nakasone, commander of U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, remarked, “Coordinating with the Ukrainians in an effort to help them harden their networks, we deployed a hunt team who sat side-by-side with our partners to gain critical insights that have increased homeland defense for both the United States and Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector firms also responded. Microsoft worked closely with the Ukrainian government and cybersecurity staff from other governments and private companies to identify and remediate Russian threat activity against Ukrainian networks before and after the Russian invasion. In January 2022, the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center identified wiper malware in over a dozen Ukrainian networks and alerted the Ukrainian government. Microsoft established a secure line of communication with Ukrainian cyber officials to provide real-time threat information and offer technical support to assist Ukrainian efforts to identify and defeat Russian-linked cyberattacks over the course of the war. Microsoft worked with Ukrainian government officials to enable controlled folder access, a Microsoft Defender feature, and helped Ukraine run endpoint detection and response solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Elon Musk’s company SpaceX activated Starlink — a satellite internet constellation that provides high-speed, low-latency broadband internet using advanced satellites in low earth orbit — in Ukraine and sent additional network terminals, including over 10,000 dish antennas. Starlink enabled members of the Ukrainian military to carry out sophisticated intelligence collection and fire support operations against Russian positions. Many of the Starlink kits donated to Ukraine included a 23-inch-wide receiver dish that needed to be mounted outside, as well as a cord that connected to a simple router that projected a Wi-Fi internet signal. Starlink helped blunt Russia’s attempt to jam signals, block the internet, and undermine Ukrainian command and control capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-for-the-future&quot;&gt;Implications for the Future&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do these lessons indicate about the future of the war in Ukraine? This analysis suggests that Russia made significant mistakes during the planning and execution phases of its military campaigns in Ukraine, which will be difficult to fix quickly. The Russian air force is not likely to possess air superiority over Ukraine, and it has run low on stocks of long-range, precision-guided munitions. Russia will also likely face long-term supply chain challenges for some weapons systems because of Western economic sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the tendency of poorly trained Russian forces to conduct massive bombardments of towns and cities in a war of attrition, rather than conducting basic fire and maneuver, will make it difficult to seize and hold substantial territory against entrenched Ukrainian ground units with Western weapons systems and a pipeline of Western logistical support. Russian cyber and electronic warfare capabilities have largely been neutralized by effective Ukrainian countermeasures, with help from Western state and non-state entities. These and other challenges contributed to high attrition rates for the Russian military, including the partial or complete destruction of at least 1,000 main battle tanks, 350 pieces of artillery, 36 fixed-wing aircraft, and 50 helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Russia will likely make some adjustments over the course of the war, including improving logistics. For example, Russia’s decision during the second phase of the war to regroup along a southern and eastern front improved Russian lines of communication. Russian forces constructed and reinforced some railheads, bridges, and roads, and Russian naval successes along the Sea of Azov allowed Russian ships to resupply Russian forces by water. These adjustments improved Russia’s ability to move spare parts, munitions, fuel, and other matériel to forward-deployed Russian forces. Yet many of Russia’s failures will require years of changes and will force the Russian military to rethink its training, organizational structure, culture, and planning to improve readiness and military performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the war in Ukraine is likely to be protracted. For the Kremlin, the status quo is likely to be unacceptable. Not only has the Russian military failed to achieve most of its objectives, but Ukraine continues to move closer militarily, economically, and politically to the West. Even worse for Moscow, NATO is likely to expand to Finland and Sweden. Russia has a recent history of attempting to grind out military victories. Following Russia’s failures during the First Chechen War (1994–1996), for example, Putin paused to revamp Russian strategy, operations, and tactics. In 1999, Russia restarted offensive operations and was much more successful in defeating insurgents during the Second Chechen War (1999–2009).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The status quo is also unlikely to be acceptable for Ukrainian leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, who indicated they are unwilling to allow more of their territory to be annexed. Since 2014, Russia has illegally annexed salami slices of Ukrainian territory, first in Crimea, then in eastern Ukraine, and finally in larger areas of southern and eastern Ukraine. In a May 2022 opinion poll, 82 percent of Ukrainians responded that Ukraine should not hand over any of its territory to Russia as part of a peace deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But winning back territory will be difficult for Ukraine. As Figures 3a, 3b, and 3c highlight at Kherson Air Base near Crimea, Russian forces have become entrenched in Ukraine with main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, electronic warfare systems, multiple rocket launchers, armored fighting vehicles, sophisticated air defense systems, and other systems. Russia has also constructed defensive fighting positions to make it difficult for Ukraine to counterattack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3c: Defensive Fighting Positions, Kherson Air Base, Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, a major U.S. and Western military objective should be to provide sufficient military assistance to help Ukraine retake territory in the east and south. If the United States and the West want to shift the balance of power in Ukraine’s favor, they will need to provide Ukraine with more weapons and platforms that allow the Ukrainian military to conduct offensive operations and more effective counterattacks against dug-in Russian forces over a sustained period. Examples include UAVs with a longer range and higher payload than the Bayraktar TB2 or AeroVironment Switchblade loitering munition, such as the MQ-1C Gray Eagle; main battle tanks, such as the Leopard 2 heavy battle tank; medium- and long-range missile systems, such as the HIMARS multiple-launch rocket system; and fighter aircraft, such as Su-25s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these systems will require additional training and a steady supply of munitions and spare parts, which should be feasible with a protracted war. More advanced weapons and platforms will be critical to overrun entrenched Russian forces. In addition, Ukraine needs to conduct a sustained guerilla campaign behind Russian lines that involves ambushes, raids, sabotage, and subversion against Russian forces and political leaders hand-picked by Moscow to replace local Ukrainian officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst outcome for Ukraine would be allowing Russia to de facto annex more Ukrainian territory. As Winston Churchill remarked on the eve of World War II, appeasement only increases a dictator’s appetite: “And do not suppose that this is the end. This is only the beginning of the reckoning. This is only the first sip, the first foretaste of a bitter cup which will be proffered to us year by year unless by a supreme recovery of moral health and martial vigour, we arise again and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past eight years, Moscow has seized larger portions of Ukrainian territory and tried to overthrow the government. There is little probability that Vladimir Putin will stop now.&lt;/p&gt;

This pro-Russia leaning during the Ukraine crisis can be understood as part of a larger propaganda trajectory vis-à-vis Russia and the United States. Domestically, China’s propaganda messaging in large part appears to resonate with public opinion. Internationally, however, Chinese propaganda about the war, especially communications by Foreign Ministry spokespeople, delude China’s neutrality position and antagonize the West, while more integrating China into the Global South.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war in Ukraine, launched shortly after the Beijing Olympics, presented a significant diplomatic challenge to the Chinese government. On the one hand, the invasion of Ukraine counters China’s vocal support for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity in the international system. On the other hand, openly opposing Russia might harm the increasingly important bilateral relationship. In the past two months, China’s official foreign-policy response to the war has attempted to stray a middle ground. China’s high-ranking officials, including Xi Jinping himself, as well as State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, have called for peace talks and an end to the war. At the United Nations, China has abstained from two UN resolutions condemning Russia, and has vetoed expulsion of Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. Thus far, China has not extended military or economic assistance to Russia and has largely abided by Western sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official Chinese propaganda about the war, including state-media reporting and Foreign Ministry communications via its spokespeople on social media, however, has been biased toward Russia. The following analysis discusses these pro-Russia leanings, followed by how China’s coverage of the war feeds into larger propaganda patterns and the implications of such pro-Russia messaging for the party’s domestic and external legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-chinese-propaganda-aligned-with-russia-on-the-ukraine-war&quot;&gt;How Chinese Propaganda Aligned with Russia on the Ukraine War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only publicly accessible propaganda directive about coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war, leaked on March 3, stresses the role of the media to mitigate public sentiment about the conflict. Specifically, it outlaws commercial websites and local and self-media from republishing foreign news articles and conducting livestreams, leaving most of the coverage in the hands of official party outlets. The directive also outlaws any challenge to China’s official foreign policy on the conflict, including antagonistic content about China-Russia relations and “harmful viewpoints that support or adulate the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An analysis of official media coverage reveals a consistent trend of sidelining the conflict, along with disproportionately channeling pro-Russia narratives and viewpoints. From the outset of the crisis to this day, the Russia-Ukraine story has been played down in Chinese media coverage. Unlike Western news outlets that have carried the story of the war on its front pages, Chinese state media, such as Renmin ribao, have prioritized major domestic news stories, such as China’s National People’s Congress (NPC) deliberations and now updates to implementation of the zero-Covid policy, amongst other stories. In comparison to Joe Biden’s widely televised emotional remarks on Ukraine at the opening of his State of the Union speech, at the two sessions of the NPC Wang Yi only mentioned Ukraine at one press conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When covering the war, China’s propaganda via state media as well as via official spokespeople has amplified Russia’s position in several ways: indirectly, by shifting the blame in the conflict to NATO and the U.S.; and directly by channeling Russia’s position on the war and thereby obfuscating its aggression as well as silencing and minimizing any perspectives from Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Shifting the blame&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An apparent trend in China’s propaganda about the war at the very outset of the conflict, but still notable during the later stages, has been the emphasis on NATO, the West, and specifically on the United States as the culprits or instigators behind the crisis. In my analysis of Xinhua News Agency’s coverage of the war during the past two months, nearly half of the articles center on critiques of the West. Analysis of the most widely shared state-media posts about the war finds that about one-third of the posts focus on blaming the West. External propaganda via state media and Chinese Foreign Ministry spokespeople on Twitter has also disproportionately focused on the West and especially on the United States. Research, carried out by the German Marshall Fund, on China’s disinformation and propaganda, for instance, finds that the United States is the most mentioned country by Chinese officials in the context of the war. This research uncovers about 366 posts on NATO expansion among China’s official accounts during the first four months of 2022, in comparison to only thirty-six posts on the same topic in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key narrative across these communications platforms is that the West is responsible for militarizing the region by overexpanding NATO in Eastern Europe and, as such, instigating Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. At the outset of the invasion, for instance, Hua Chunying, assistant minister of Foreign Affairs, noted at a press briefing that some countries (alluding to the Western countries) should consider whether they “forced a major country into a dead end,” referring to U.S. violations of agreements with Russia and NATO’s expansion along Russia’s border. China’s state media, including Xinhua News Agency, blamed the United States for “stoking the fire” (拱火) by delivering constant warnings about Putin’s military plans and by galvanizing massive weapons delivery to Ukraine. On March 21, for instance, Xinhua News Agency claimed that the U.S. had “triple-gained” (一石三鸟) during the war by “first, propagating Russia’s threat to speed up the circling of Russia; second, taking the opportunity to extinguish the “flare” of the European pursuit of strategic autonomy and independent security affairs; and third, by making the American military and defense industry interest groups profiteers from the conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than targeting the West as the culprit, some official communications have also amplified the double-standards rhetoric, or the argument that the United States lacks legitimacy in criticizing Russia as well as China for not aligning with the West. In the past two months, there has been a flood of messaging by China’s official spokespeople aimed at discrediting the moral standing of the United States. At a March 4 press briefing, for instance, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin responded to U.S. accusations about China’s prior knowledge of Putin’s plans by calling them slander and by questioning whether the U.S. has made any real contributions toward world peace, accusing it of profiting from conflict. Other spokespeople have called out specific accusations about alleged war crimes. “Apart from Agent Orange, U.S. military planes brought ordnances and also landmines that are still posing threats to the daily lives of the Cambodian people,” tweeted Zhao Lijian, while sharing a video produced by Xinhua. Overall, anti-Western, and especially anti-U.S., framing has been prominent in China’s official communications about the war, positioning the U.S. as the aggressor and as a morally bankrupt actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Channeling Russia’s positions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than indirectly supporting Russia by shifting responsibility to the West and to the United States — the narrative also widely communicated by Russian authorities in defense of its “military operations” — China’s official propaganda has consistently prioritized Russia’s position in the war. Taking the Xinhua News Agency (Chinese edition) as an illustration, its coverage of the war has predominantly favored Russian perspectives. In explaining Russia’s rationale for the war to domestic audiences, Xinhua News Agency has directly and uncritically publicized Putin’s rhetoric of “denazification” and “demilitarization,” though it is important to note that the initial reference to the war as a “military operation” was later changed to the “Russia-Ukraine war.” In reporting on the ongoing battles, Xinhua has played down both Ukraine’s military gains and Ukraine’s suffering. A widely publicized story in the West about Ukraine’s sinking of the Russian navy ship, for instance, was reported by Xinhua as the warship caught on fire due to undetermined causes. The article quotes Russia’s popular news media, Sputnik. Russia’s gains, in contrast, have been amplified. In an update on the progress of Russia’s “military operations,” a Xinhua report highlights the number of Ukrainian military facilities successfully targeted and destroyed by Russian forces in Ukraine. In reporting on Russia’s military progress, moreover, the story of Russia’s military aggression against civilian targets is largely absent. A report about a residential building being hit by a rocket, for instance, does not place responsibility on Russia, and the story about the Bucha massacre only receives indirect mention, calling for further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Xinhua news coverage as well as in other Chinese official media reports, Russia’s position has been communicated through reliance on Russian official voices and footage. A large-scale analysis of the most shared posts from China’s official media outlets finds that nearly half of such posts can be classified as pro-Russian, meaning that they include some information that is either taken directly from Russian state media or is attributed to a Russian official. In my analysis of reporting by Xinhua, voices of Russian military officials and spokespeople are disproportionately used. In analyzing Xinwen lianbo, CCTV’s nightly news program, I also found that coverage of the war either relies on Russian media footage or on reporting by CCTV correspondents in Russia (Moscow). In the unusual case of Phoenix TV, the Chinese correspondent even embedded himself with Russian forces in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, Chinese state media and Foreign Ministry spokespeople directly amplify Russia’s disinformation about the war. In March, state media and official spokespeople spread Russia’s official provocations about U.S.-funded biolabs in Ukraine. China’s Central Television Station, CCTV, for instance, reported on Moscow’s biolab theory as part of its news package, citing Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, also shared inflammatory posts about the threats from U.S. biolabs in Ukraine. During his March 8 press briefing, for instance, he echoed Russia’s claims about the biolabs and called on the U.S. to “disclose specific information as soon as possible, including information about which viruses are stored there and what research has been conducted.” His remarks and Twitter posts on this issue have been disseminated by Chinese state-media outlets. Russia’s disinformation was also amplified in the context of international allegations about Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine. Several official Chinese media outlets, for instance, directly echo Russia’s line on the Bucha massacre as manufactured or faked by Ukrainians. The only story referring to the incident by Xinhua News Agency (Chinese version) quotes multiple Russian officials, including the Russian defense minister, the press secretary, the Russian ambassador to the UN, and the Russian foreign minister, that cast doubt on Ukraine-reported atrocities in Bucha. The CGTN report about the Bucha massacre starts out with concerns expressed by Western leaders, and then most of the report is devoted to Russia’s pushback against them, uncritically quoting a number of Russian officials. The two more balanced articles from CGTN and Xinhua News (English edition) similarly call for a “full investigation” into what they refer to respectively as the “Bucha killings” and the “Bucha incident,” but not directly acknowledging the massacre or Russia’s responsibility for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Minimizing Ukraine’s perspective and alternative voices about the war&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While amplifying Russian perspectives, Chinese official communications about the war have deliberately minimized Ukraine’s position in this conflict. In the entire corpus of Xinhua’s (Chinese edition) coverage of the war, only about a dozen stories emphasize Ukraine’s perspective by citing voices from Ukraine. A few of these stories highlight Ukraine’s selective victories vis-à-vis Russia, but others frame Ukraine as isolated and helpless. When Ukraine’s application to join NATO did not elicit a positive response, for instance, Xinhua quoted President Zelensky as lamenting about being abandoned by the West. In my analysis of CCTV’s Xinwen lianbo coverage, I find that the featured Ukrainian perspectives are largely those of high-ranking officials like Zelensky, and they are mostly in the context of peace negotiations with Russia, channeling a hopeful message about the Ukrainians’ readiness to come to an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are slight distinctions worth noting between domestically and externally oriented Chinese state-media coverage when it comes to channeling perspectives from Ukraine. In contrast to CCTV, CGTN has carried more reporting about Ukraine’s casualties and suffering in the war. For example, on April 14, a CGTN reporter who visited the city of Chernihiv that had been besieged by Russian forces, recorded footage of war-ravaged buildings in this battleground city. On the same day, another CGTN reporter met returning residents to a town surrounding Kyiv and interviewed them about their experiences during the war. The differences in the CGTN coverage versus the CCTV coverage may be attributed to its distinct positioning as China’s main international news outlet catering to global audiences and working to compete with outlets such as CNN and Al Jazeera. Scholars of CCTV International, the predecessor of CGTN, have argued that CGTN has long enjoyed a special position in the Chinese media system, allowing it more space for daring on-the-ground reporting. English-language coverage of the war by Xinhua News Agency also features some differences from the Chinese-language coverage, with the former incorporating more stories about Ukraine’s military victories, such as the retaking of the Chernobyl plant as well as about civilian casualties due to Russian airstrikes. Again, this is likely attributed to the external positioning of this content and the fact that Xinhua appears as a more legitimate news outlet internationally. At the same time, when it comes to more contentious stories about the war, such as the Bucha massacre, the more neutral positions of CGTN and Xinhua (English edition) still tilt toward Russia, as discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;explaining-pro-russia-propaganda&quot;&gt;Explaining Pro-Russia Propaganda&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s pro-Russia propaganda during the Russia-Ukraine war has been interpreted by some Western media and analysts as an indication of China’s pro-Russia policy. As noted in the introduction, however, China’s foreign policy during this crisis has been relatively cautious, including abiding by the Western sanctions, halting some economic projects in Russia, and largely abstaining from either direct condemnation of or support for Russia’s war. The pro-Russia leanings in official propaganda should be understood as part of larger trends in China’s political communications and as a product of behavior that is opportunistic and self-preserving (and in some cases self-promoting) by official media outlets and spokespeople.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current patterns in pro-Russia coverage build on long-term trends in official communications on foreign-policy matters, especially on Russia and the United States. Coverage of major international events has always been strictly regulated, with commercial media and online outlets given little space to publish alternative perspectives. Coverage concerning major countries such as Russia and the United States has been treated with special sensitivity by propaganda officials and media gatekeepers. In my research on political constraints on external propaganda, drawing on interviews with journalists at official media outlets, including Xinhua News Agency, I find that there is a general understanding among media professionals that Russia should be covered in a positive light. From my observations during the past decade, negative coverage of Russian politics, including protest movements against Putin’s regime, has largely been avoided by Chinese news outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The positive portrayal of both Russia and Putin’s regime carries a symbolic significance in communicating China’s friendship to Russia, but it also serves a defensive function of avoiding exposure of the Chinese people to political movements and dissent against authoritarian governments. In the context of the Ukraine war, the echoing by Chinese official media of Russian perspectives allows China to communicate sympathy toward Russia without bearing the practical costs of being pro-Russia in foreign policy. Softening the image of Russia as an aggressor also preempts domestic critiques of China’s lack of direct involvement in this crisis as well as the larger questioning of Putin’s political legitimacy and also that of authoritarian political systems in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anti-U.S. and anti-Western component of China’s official communications about the war, in turn, is consistent with the increasingly pervasive critiques of the United States (and the West) in China’s domestic and external communications. Prior to the Trump era and in the early phases of his presidency, Chinese media professionals shared that, similar to their reporting on Russia, coverage of the United States was largely limited to a more constructive tone, or an emphasis on hopefulness and potential solutions to any frictions. As the China-U.S. relationship continued to deteriorate, however, the portrayal of the United States shifted toward more scrutiny. In the past years, Chinese domestic and global official media have frequently reported on the fractures in U.S. democracy, as evident in the detailed coverage of events such as the January 6 insurrection and the Black Lives Matter protest movements. Most recently, news about the racially motivated Buffalo mass shooting has been widely circulating on Chinese social-media platforms. Critiques of U.S. foreign policy have also become more apparent and explicit, especially those expressed by more combative Foreign Ministry spokespeople such as Zhao Lijian or former Global Times editor Hu Xujin. The framing of the U.S.-led Western military coalition, NATO, as responsible for sparking the current war in Ukraine and the depiction of the United States as an untrustworthy international mediator feed into the larger patterns in Chinese media of targeting the moral standing of the U.S. as an exemplary democracy and as a global leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extensive reliance on official Russian voices and footage by Chinese media in the context of this war, moreover, can be interpreted as an act of self-preservation and political opportunism. In the face of long-standing propaganda policies, along with specific directives allegedly prohibiting scrutiny of Russia-China relations or portrayals of the West in a positive light, Chinese official communicators have limited options. Using either Western or Ukrainian footage and perspectives risks antagonizing Russia and presenting the West as a unified force for morality and peace. Selectively relying on Russian perspectives and footage has allowed for covering of the conflict, while bypassing a dichotomous portrayal of Russia as the aggressor and the West as the savior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some official communicators, such as the Foreign Ministry spokespeople, have also likely taken advantage of this crisis to position themselves as relentless critics of the United States — something that plays well with domestic audiences. Zhao Lijian’s and Hua Chunying’s comments on Twitter, for instance, were widely circulated on Chinese social media. Following Zhao Lijian’s speculative post on Twitter about U.S.-funded biolabs in Ukraine, for instance, the nationalist tabloid Global Times circulated a screenshot on Weibo that received 4,800 likes and many nationalistic comments. The external social-media posts by Chinese diplomats are routinely transmitted by state media to an internal social-media platform, which feeds into the nationalistic online sentiments. I engage with this convergence and with the domestic implications of China’s pro-Russia communications in more detail in the following section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;domestic-implications-of-pro-russia-propaganda-reinforcing-nationalism&quot;&gt;Domestic Implications of Pro-Russia Propaganda: Reinforcing Nationalism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestically, the pro-Russia leanings in official coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war appear to have resonated and merged with trends in public opinion. My analysis of widely circulated public commentaries about the war on Weibo reveals a strongly nationalistic bent and a pervasive depiction of the war as a conflict between Russia and the West (and especially the United States) rather than a conflict between Russia and Ukraine. As in the official coverage, the West and the United States are often portrayed as the instigators. A popular commentary on Weibo, for instance, which generated about 4,600 shares, calls for the United States to abandon its hegemonic power and justifies wars as necessary for peace. Another Weibo user posted a self-made video reviewing the bombing records of the U.S. army, which received more than 3,600 shares and over 9,000 likes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although other than social-media trends, we have limited access to Chinese public opinion trends about the Ukraine war, one survey conducted between March 28 and April 5 by the Carter Center China Focus finds that the majority of respondents (75 percent) agree that China’s support for Russia in Ukraine is in China’s national interest. Interestingly, more consumption of state media, social media, as well as higher levels of education correlate with higher support for Russia in this survey. Other than revealing an apparent pro-Russia leaning in public opinion, this survey also finds a high percentage of respondents (70 percent) believing in conspiracy theories about U.S. biolabs in Ukraine — a finding that similarly correlates with the higher education and exposure to official and social-media channels. Though this survey represents only a fraction of the Chinese population (4,886 respondents), it reveals a convergence across official propaganda, social-media commentaries, and public opinion — all reinforcing one another in the context of Russia’s war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In thinking about how Chinese propaganda on Ukraine plays into the domestic legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party, therefore, there are several potential implications. First, the leaning of the pro-Russia official media has thus far played into domestic nationalistic sentiments, as evident in the similarities between official and non-official anti-Western messaging on Weibo as well as in apparent public trust in anti-U.S. conspiracy theories. Second, the Russia-leaning coverage may work in favor of the party by inhibiting more public challenging of China’s position on Ukraine. If more Ukrainian footage is shown and allowed to circulate on social media, public opinion may shift in favor of Ukraine and toward a questioning of China’s ambivalent position in this crisis. At the same time, pro-Russia propaganda in this conflict may also serve to limit official flexibility in its foreign-policy maneuvering. Shifting toward aligning with the West or against Russia could be interpreted as weak or unpatriotic by the Chinese public, leaving China in a perpetual state of diplomatic ambiguity and awkward neutrality regardless of how far Russia goes in its efforts to reclaim Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;external-implications-chinas-uneven-global-favorability&quot;&gt;External Implications: China’s Uneven Global Favorability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Externally, China’s Russia-leaning propaganda has served to further alienate the Western countries. In parts of the Global South, however, China’s narratives have converged with local messaging, especially when it comes to questioning the West as the symbol of morality in the international system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Western context, China’s pro-Russia messaging has impeded its attempts to stake out a neutral position in this crisis and has aggravated existing concerns about the growing China-Russia nexus as a threat to liberal democracies. The common associations of China’s propaganda with official foreign policy mean that its pro-Russia messaging is often interpreted as official policy. “China’s promotion of Russian disinformation indicates where its loyalties are,” reads the title of CNN’s long-form analysis of China’s coverage of the war in Ukraine. A joint statement, issued following the recent EU-U.S. dialogue on China, criticizes China for spreading Russian disinformation about its war in Ukraine. It does not help that China’s pro-Russia propaganda has garnered more media and policy attention than have its more neutral foreign-policy measures, such as its attention to abiding by the Western sanctions against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, China’s messaging has amplified fears of a China-Russia alliance. A Pew public opinion poll published on April 28 about how Americans see China, for instance, reveals that the top public concern of Americans is the China-Russia partnership. About 62 percent of the surveyed adults see the relationship as a “serious problem.” This compares to about 47 percent who regard China’s involvement in U.S. politics as problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In much of the Global South, however, China’s messaging about the war has not elicited major concerns. In contrast, some of China’s official narratives, especially the emphasis on the West being responsible, have been publicized by high-level officials. In South Africa, for instance, President Ramaphosa has publicly blamed NATO for the war in Ukraine. Brazil’s presidential front-runner, Lula de Silva, in a recent interview similarly blamed the U.S. and the EU, as well as Putin and Zelensky, for inciting the war. China’s decision not to condemn Russia for the war also resonates with many other developing countries that similarly have taken a more neutral stance, as evidenced by their abstentions in the recent UN resolutions against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it appears that China’s pro-Russia propaganda during the Ukraine war has cost it some soft power in the West, but it has potentially resulted in soft power gains in the Global South. It remains to be seen whether and how these relative shifts in China’s favorability will shape its foreign policy in the future. Much depends on how the war progresses and the international consequences faced by Putin’s regime as a result of its aggression in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s official stance of neutrality on the war in Ukraine conflicts with its propaganda messaging. Its state-media outlets and Foreign Ministry spokespeople have tilted toward Russia by emphasizing the responsibility of the West in instigating the conflict as well as by prioritizing Russia’s position and voices in its coverage, while minimizing or downplaying voices from Ukraine. The externally oriented state-media outlets have featured slightly more balanced reporting, but they still stress the responsibility of the West and largely skirt the most contentious stories, such as Russia’s war crimes. These pro-Russia leanings are rooted in larger trends in official communications about China’s relations with Russia and the United States. As the war progresses, the messaging might soften slightly, especially in English-language outlets, but it is unlikely to fundamentally shift considering the sensitivity of this issue and the multifaceted political pressures placed on official commentators. Thus far, this approach has resonated domestically and has converged with some elites and publics in the Global South. In the West, however, China’s pro-Russia propaganda has been interpreted as a threat and a sign of escalation in the battle between democracies and autocracies.&lt;/p&gt;

It argues that the war created an immediate diplomatic “trilemma” for China as it sought to balance three competing interests: alignment with Russia, adherence to core principles of Chinese foreign policy and need for stability with the United States and Europe.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;To manage this trilemma, China adopted a policy that I term a “strategic straddle” in which China tries to balance these competing interests at the same time. In practice, this straddle has manifested in strong rhetorical, informational and diplomatic support for Russia while, at the same time, Beijing has been very careful, to date, to avoid providing substantial material support to Russia. Maintaining this balancing act will be difficult as Russian needs grow. In relations with the United States and Europe, China has sought to put a floor under worsening relations but has had limited success doing so. The one area where China has sought strategic advantage is in its ties with the Global South, which is suffering from economic dislocations associated with the war. China has sought to use these deprivations to generate greater solidarity in resisting U.S.-led rules, norms and institutions. China’s ability to maintain this straddle will be challenged the complexities of managing competing ties with these different countries, regions and institutions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese President Xi Jinping is having a bad 2022. Despite an auspicious start with China hosting the Winter Olympics in February, it has been all downhill since then – and rapidly so. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February has a lot to do with it. The war immediately created several challenges for China at a time when Xi seeks stability as he prepares for a leadership transition this fall. The Ukraine war immediately put pressure on many of China’s most important external relationships. It also sparked a series of rolling economic shocks – spikes in commodity prices, supply chain disruptions, and the prospect of a major European recession – that hit the Chinese economy during a period of worsening structural fragility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most pointedly, the Russian invasion of Ukraine occurred a mere twenty days after Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a joint statement outlining a substantial, if not historic, strategic alignment. The proximity of the February 4 China-Russia joint statement and the February 24 invasion of Ukraine put China at the center of a major war in Europe and one of the most defining moments in global politics since the end of the Cold War. These events prompted international policymakers and commentators to focus immediately on China and ask: How will China react and what is its true position on the invasion? What do Beijing’s statements and actions reveal about its strategic intentions? And what are the implications for Chinese foreign policy, U.S.-China relations, and global politics?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address these and other questions, this article will analyze Chinese government statements and actions since the February invasion as well as the writings of Chinese commentators and scholars. To a limited degree, this analysis draws on conversations with Chinese scholars and analysts during the past several months. The article begins with a focus on the dilemmas facing China to frame the subsequent analysis. The bulk of the article then examines how Beijing has managed its competing interests in diplomacy toward the United States, Russia, Europe, the United Nations, and the developing world. The relative success and/or failure of this strategic straddle by China will have a substantial effect on the shape and contours of global politics going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conceptualizing-the-straddle-chinas-diplomatic-trilemma&quot;&gt;Conceptualizing the Straddle: China’s Diplomatic “Trilemma”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s diplomatic response to the Russian invasion is driven by the desire to balance three competing interests: alignment with Russia, commitment to long-standing principles in Chinese foreign policy, and China’s ties with the United States and Europe. The more China does on one, the more it undercuts at least one of the other interests. China’s desire and ability to manage this “trilemma” have directly motivated its various diplomatic behaviors since the outbreak of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s first interest is to retain and grow its alignment with Russia amid the ignominy of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Far from a relationship of strategic convenience, the China-Russia relationship has substantial and enduring roots. It is based on a common vision of global politics focused on constraining U.S. power, common material interests surrounding trade in energy and military technology, and common values regarding the virtue of authoritarian political systems pursuing state-directed development strategies. At its core, Moscow and Beijing see the United States as the main threat to both their domestic and their external stability. The personal ties between Putin and Xi serve as a lubricant of the former three drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second major interest in China’s evolving trilemma is to maintain the perception of its commitment to protect territorial integrity and sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. This is a “core interest” for China and central to the identity and, thus, legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Xi mentioned this in his April 21, 2022 speech as one of the five pillars of his Global Security Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third major Chinese interest implicated in this trilemma is China’s relationships with the United States and Europe. The latter are two of China’s largest and most important trading partners, which China cannot afford to alienate (at least right now). Beyond China’s economic stakes, Chinese strategists believe that an unstable and outwardly hostile relationship with the United States could derail China’s national rejuvenation in myriad ways, including a security crisis over, for example, Taiwan. Similarly, China has long seen Europe as a swing vote in geopolitics and has sought to prevent it from overly aligning against China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;articulating-the-straddle-chinas-official-rhetoric-on-the-russian-invasion&quot;&gt;Articulating the Straddle: China’s Official Rhetoric on the Russian Invasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A starting point for understanding China’s diplomatic response in 2022 is appreciating the differences compared to Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine. Back then, China’s reaction was more neutral in both word and deed. China did not vociferously defend Russia and it abstained from all key UN votes. China also did not immediately provide economic assistance, which eventually emerged but mainly in the form of favorable investment deals for China. Also, China did not provide any military assistance in 2014. According to an analysis by Alexander Gabuev, “the [2014] crisis provided a great opportunity for Beijing to turn Russia into a junior partner in the relationship and secure many of its strategic interests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to 2014, China’s official rhetoric has been notable for its shrill tone and anti-U.S. and anti-Western content and for the persistence of this rhetoric. From the beginning of the war, China’s Foreign Ministry has refused to call it an invasion or to criticize Russia for violating another country’s sovereignty, and it has consistently blamed the United States and NATO for provoking Russia and now, for prolonging the war by arming Ukraine. China has offered only the most generic calls for a negotiated solution. It has also consistently stated that it supports the UN Charter and the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity, without any acknowledgment of the obvious tensions in its position. Chinese criticism of U.S. policy – from both officials as well as state media – have been notably harsh and continue to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning with a cameo appearance by Ms. Hua Chunying as Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) spokesperson on February 24 – temporarily taking the place of Zhao Lijian and Wang Weibin – she offered a uniquely tough criticism of the United States and NATO. When asked about the legitimacy of the Russian invasion, she referred to China being invaded by the Eight Power Allied Force in 1900 to suggest Western hypocrisy. To bring home the point, she then referenced the accidental NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Serbia in 1999 by stating “NATO still owes the Chinese people a debt of blood.” Hua concluded, “Even today, China still faces a realistic threat from the US flanked by its several allies. …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tone and substance of Chinese criticisms have persisted since then, with a heavy focus on the culpability of U.S. and NATO policies. Major state-media outlets, such as People’s Daily and PLA Daily, have regularly published particularly pointed and harsh critiques of the United States and NATO. Senior diplomats regularly echo these points. In a May 6 speech before an online dialogue with twenty global think tanks, First Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said, “Basically, [the United States] wants to profit from the war and control Europe, “weaken” Russia and sustain their hegemonic power at the expense of Ukraine. So, they are killing many birds with one stone, and that explains why they keep doing it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s official rhetoric has evolved in interesting ways. First, China has refused to refer to its position on the war as “neutral” but rather as “objective and impartial,” as first stated by Foreign Minister Wang Yi as early as March 7. Second, since early March, as the crisis escalated, Chinese officials and diplomats spoke of peace and negotiations in all of their meetings and calls. Yet, when a senior EU official in March floated the idea of China hosting a diplomatic mediation, Beijing very carefully avoided the issue. In March, Wang Yi outlined a six-point proposal to address the growing humanitarian crisis. Since then, Beijing has provided limited assistance once it evacuated Chinese nationals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, China has assiduously avoided every opportunity to criticize Russian military actions. It did not criticize Russia in early March when its forces started attacking civilian targets in Ukraine, when Russia refused to allow humanitarian corridors out of active war zones, and when reports emerged in April about Russian military atrocities and alleged war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, beginning in mid-March, China’s official rhetoric has gone on the offensive. It has focused on enumerating the threats resulting from the U.S. and allied reaction. Chinese officials and commentators started claiming that NATO now poses a threat to Asia, with some Chinese raising the prospect of an Asian NATO to turn attention to U.S. alliances in Asia. In his May 6 speech, Le Yucheng said, “For quite some time, the U.S. has kept flexing its muscle on China’s doorstep. …If this is not an Asia-Pacific version of NATO’s eastward expansion, then what is?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese officials and commentaries have highlighted economic risks as well. In April and around the time of the Bucha revelations, Chinese commentaries in People’s Daily started criticizing the global sanctions regime on Russia by calling it “financial terrorism” (金融恐怖主义), “economic hegemonism” (经济霸权主义), and “economic weaponization” (经济武器化). Le Yucheng reinforced these themes by saying, “History has shown time and again that unilateral sanctions have never been an effective solution to any problem. They are just a tool of hegemony and power politics, always adding fuel to the fire and magnifying and complicating the existing problems.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s rhetorical posture can be summarized in this way: denial, deflection, diversion, and division. China denies that Russia caused this situation, and that China has any role. China deflects responsibility from Russia and itself, focusing on blaming U.S. policy and especially NATO expansion for provoking Russia. China is seeking to divert attention from Russia and the war by highlighting the alleged security and economic risks caused by the actions of the United States and its allies. And China seeks to create divisions between the United States and Europe as well as between the United States and its allies and partners in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operationalizing-the-straddle-chinas-diplomatic-behavior&quot;&gt;Operationalizing the Straddle: China’s Diplomatic Behavior&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond rhetoric, China’s operational diplomacy in reaction to the invasion is a second layer to understanding its strategic straddle. China’s actual behavior reveals, far more than the words alone, how China has sought to balance its competing interests. This section examines China’s diplomacy toward the United States, Russia, the United Nations, Europe, and the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. U.S.-China Ties&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China’s most important relationship, Beijing has invested time and energy trying to stabilize ties with Washington since the invasion. It has done so with a series of discreet high-level interactions. Three weeks after the invasion, Xi sent his top diplomatic adviser and Politburo member Yang Jiechi to meet with Jake Sullivan in Rome on March 14. The Rome meeting was quickly followed four days later by a video meeting between presidents Biden and Xi Jinping, their second video call since November 2021 (and their third interaction since Biden’s inauguration). The Chinese Foreign Minister had at least three calls with U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken since the invasion. China’s ambassador to the United States Qin Gang has been particularly active, including notable initiatives, such as a March 15 article in the Washington Post, a March 20 on-camera interview on the Sunday morning news show Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan, and an April 18 piece in the online edition of The National Interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s diplomatic strategy is to put a floor under U.S.-China ties to prevent a rapid, substantial, or sustained deterioration as the war evolves. It has done so in several ways. First, Chinese leaders and officials have sought to deflect U.S. criticisms of China. They argue the following: (1) China knew nothing about the conflict in advance (an issue of substantial U.S. debate during the early weeks of the conflict); (2) U.S. and NATO policies provoked Russia and the U.S. needs to act to resolve this; and (3) China is committed to territorial integrity and sovereignty and a peaceful resolution of the crisis. Underlying these arguments is a deep Chinese mistrust of U.S. motives, believing the U.S. and NATO provoked Russia in order to weaken it. In the words of Le Yucheng, “Some big countries do not want to get dragged into conflicts and bring harm to themselves, so they turn small countries into their cat’s paw and even use them to fight proxy wars.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China has carefully maneuvered to avoid becoming a target of U.S. and international sanctions. Beijing denied U.S. press reports in mid-March that it was preparing to provide – but had not yet transferred – military assistance to Russia. Chinese firms have been careful to avoid violating the international sanctions. (More on that below.) In a unique move likely taken to address mounting U.S. concerns, China appeared to adjust its Russia policy. In a March 27 TV interview, China’s U.S. ambassador stated that although there is no ceiling in China-Russia ties, it “does have a bottom line, which is the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, the international law and basic norms governing international relations. These are the guideline for China to deal with relations with any country.” This statement implies that China will not provide material support to Russia’s invasion, but it will actively cooperate in many other areas (i.e., “no limits” to China-Russia ties).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, China used the March 18 Biden-Xi meeting to create a framework to stabilize relations. Xi did so by specifying Chinese expectations of U.S. policy. In an unusually detailed meeting readout, the Chinese stated: “President Biden has just reiterated that the U.S. does not seek to have a new Cold War with China, to change China’s system, or to revitalize alliances against China, and that the U.S. does not support ‘Taiwan independence’ or intend to seek a conflict with China.” Several Chinese scholars now refer to this summary as the new “five no’s” of America’s China policy. As an indication of the importance of this, Xi stated to Biden, “I take these remarks very seriously,” implying that Xi will hold the United States to them and perhaps link Chinese behavior to U.S. compliance with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Beijing sought to put a floor under its deteriorating relationship with Washington, the United States sought to put a ceiling on China’s relationship with Russia to prevent Beijing from providing substantial material assistance – military and/or economic – to Russia. As of this writing, China has avoided crossing the two bright lines in U.S. policy: military assistance to Russia and systematic evasion of the international sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This U.S. approach has created a symmetry of sorts, between U.S. and Chinese goals. Beijing’s “floor” for U.S.-China ties (based on Biden’s “five no’s”) and Washington’s “ceiling” on China-Russia cooperation appears to have created a de facto equilibrium in bilateral relations. How fragile this will be and what actions might trigger an unraveling remain open questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one major exception to the fragile equilibrium in U.S.-China ties has been China’s activities with Russia to spread disinformation about the war, and specifically about the U.S. role. China has promoted several false narratives, often copying the Kremlin’s justification for the war. However, Chinese disinformation activities are quite different from past efforts, heightening U.S. concerns. Disinformation has not only been promoted by Chinese state-run media and government-supported social-media accounts but also by Chinese diplomats and other officials, including by Foreign Ministry spokespersons. In addition, there is a growing body of evidence that Russia and China are not only conducting parallel activities but that they have joined forces to coordinate their actions to spread false information. This is a new and rapidly growing source of tensions in U.S.-China ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. China-Russia Ties&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as China’s U.S. policy has involved a careful balancing act between word and deed, China’s diplomatic strategy toward Russia has reflected a similar calibration, albeit in different ways. Beijing has maintained substantial rhetorical support for Russia (including with active disinformation efforts); it has sustained high-level interactions with senior Russian officials; and it has sustained high profile military exercises, albeit ones not directly related to the war. At the same time, China has also signaled some limits to its diplomatic and material assistance to Russia, as reflected in its UN activities and its sanctions compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day after the invasion and in a curious move, Xi held a call with President Putin (this has been their only known call since invasion). Chinese support and sympathy was evident. In the Chinese readout of the call, Xi called the invasion a “special military operation,” using Putin’s preferred term. In offering his support for Russia, Xi stated that it is “important to…take seriously and respect the reasonable security concerns of all countries and reach a balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism through negotiation.” Xi said this in response to Putin’s claim that NATO’s “continued military deployment eastward has challenged Russia’s strategic red line.” In the call, Xi did restate China’s commitment to territorial integrity and sovereignty and the UN Charter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that baseline, China has sustained a consistent pace of meetings with Russian officials and has used them to reiterate its strong support for Moscow. In late March, about a month into the war, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, for the first time since the invasion; interestingly, he did so not in Beijing but in Anhui province on the margins of a meeting among several foreign ministers related to Afghanistan. Wang Yi could not have been more positive. He stated, “China-Russia relations have withstood the new test of an evolving international landscape, remained on the right course, and shown resilient development momentum. Both sides are more determined to develop bilateral relations and more confident in advancing cooperation in various fields.” Indeed, he stated the two sides shared a determination “to take China-Russian ties to a higher level.” Wang reiterated China’s support for resolving the Ukraine crisis through dialogue, but he also acknowledged Russia’s “legitimate” security concerns stemming from a “Cold War mentality and group confrontation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some twenty days later in mid-April and as Russian atrocities were becoming more public, Executive Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng – a potential successor to Wang Yi – met with Russian Ambassador to China Andrey Ivanovich Denisov in Beijing. As reports of Russian targeting of civilians and Russian atrocities at Bucha were emerging, Le Yucheng outlined an ambitious future for the relationship. Le began the meeting by touting a 30 percent increase in China-Russia trade in the first quarter of 2022, and then he encouraged Denisov by stating, “No matter how the international landscape may change, China will continue to strengthen strategic coordination with Russia for win-win cooperation, jointly safeguard the common interests of the two countries and promote the building of a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind.” Ukraine or the war were not mentioned in the Chinese readout of the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a further sign of the value China assigns to the relationship, Politburo Standing Committee member Li Zhanshu hosted a video meeting on April 15 with his Russian counterpart, Valentina Matviyenko, speaker of the Russian Federation Council of the Federal Assembly. A noted Xi Jinping confidant and third ranking in the CCP, Li knows Russia well from when he previously served as Xi’s special envoy. This meeting constituted the highest bilateral exchange since the war began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Li was robust in his affirmation of Sino-Russian ties, including by using a new formulation. He highlighted China’s commitment to the Putin-Xi leadership consensus (共识), known as “the four firmly support each other” (四个相互坚定支持). Li then called for both sides “to constantly consolidate and develop” their strategic partnership. He referred to China-Russia relations as “mature, tenacious and stable with strong endogenous power and independent value” (成熟, 坚韧, 稳定, 具有强大的内生动力和独立价值). This formulation had not previously been used in its entirety, at least in public. Based on Chinese press accounts of the meeting, Li did not mention Ukraine or the war. He did not reiterate China’s commitment to territorial integrity and sovereignty, but he did reaffirm the old line that Sino-Russian relations were based on non-alignment, non-confrontation, and non-targeting of third parties. After the meeting, Li Zhanshu accepted the Russian “Friendship Medal” from Matviyenko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a notable move, in late May and during a meeting in Tokyo among the leaders of the U.S., Japan, Australia and India, China and Russia flew a joint strategic bomber patrol into the Sea of Japan. The exercise, a first since the invasion, involved two Chinese warplane and four Russian ones. According to U.S. press reports, Chinese naval vessels likely took part in the joint exercise as well. This was the fourth joint bomber exercise around Japan since 2018 but the timing of this one - during a meeting of the leaders of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue - suggested an effort by Beijing and Moscow to signal solidarity and resistance to the Quad. As the first military exercise since February, this action offers some indication of the type of activities China will conduct under its modified policy of “no ceiling” but also a bottom-line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. China’s UN Diplomacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to China’s pattern of consistent rhetorical support for Russia, China’s defense of Russia in the United Nations and UN organizations has been more tepid. China has been exceptionally careful in all the relevant UN votes by avoiding directly backing Russia and finding support in numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As summarized in Chart 1 below, among the seven key UN votes since the war began (as of this writing), China abstained in five of them and supported Russia in only two (and only one of these was substantive). Among China’s abstentions included some meaningful ones that put a distance between Beijing and Moscow. China abstained in the first two UN Security Council (UNSC) votes on the war. The first condemned Russia for the invasion (which Russia vetoed) and the second called for a UN General Assembly (UNGA) emergency special session on Ukraine. China then abstained in the actual UNGA vote on the latter, along with thirty-four other countries. China notably also abstained on the UN Human Rights Council vote to create a commission of inquiry into Russian atrocities; only Russia and Eritrea voted “no” on that action, which ultimately passed. China’s one meaningful “no” vote in support of Russia (along with twenty-three other countries) was the April 7 UNGA action to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council, which passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the UN, China has been supportive of Russia not being excluded from attending the G-20 in Bali, Indonesia, in November. The United States, Australia, and Ukraine have publicly encouraged Indonesia, the G20 chair this year, to exclude Russia. In response, China has heaped diplomatic pressure on Jakarta to include Russia. In late March, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in a meeting with his Indonesian counterpart in China, called for the G20 not to be politicized and not to be divided. As a sign of how important this is to China, Xi Jinping then called Indonesian President Joko Widodo to say that the G20 summit is not an appropriate platform to discuss political security issues such as Ukraine. China’s efforts appear to have been effective. Indonesia’s president announced in late April that both Presidents Putin and Zelensky were invited to attend the G20 this year. To date, only Putin has accepted. (Unlike Russia, Ukraine is not a permanent member of the G20.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GJ31cqg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: China’s Ukraine-related votes at the United Nations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. China and the International Sanctions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, China’s approach to the sanctions has two dimensions: ardent rhetorical opposition and careful compliance. China opposed international sanctions on Russia from the very beginning of the war. Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said multiple times, “China always opposes the use of sanctions to solve problems, and even more opposes unilateral sanctions that have no basis in international law, which will undermine international rules and bring harm to the people’s livelihood of all countries.” Guo Shuqing, China’s chief banking and insurance regulator, went further in stating in early March that China “will not participate in such sanctions, and we will continue to maintain normal economic, trade and financial exchanges with relevant parties.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rhetoric aside, Chinese entities – both state-owned and private – have made a variety of different decisions about reducing operations in Russia. As of this writing, U.S. officials have stated publicly that they see no evidence of “systematic violations” of the economic sanctions by China. The following categories of Chinese actions are based on a Yale School of Management database and press reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thirty-nine Chinese firms are maintaining business as usual in Russia, earning them a grade of “F” from the Yale database. Several high-profile names on this list include: Agricultural Bank of China, Alibaba, ANT Group, Didi Chuxing, Lenovo, SMIC, UnionPay, Tencent, among others. Of the 206 global companies in this category, China is the largest single country as of late May 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Six Chinese entities are holding off on new investments. They are: Binance, Huawei, and UnionPay, as well as three large state-owned firms – CNOOC, PetroChina, and Sinochem.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One Chinese firm, Sinopec, is scaling back major business operations while continuing other operations. It alone has suspended $500 million worth of new investments. Sinopec is one of 130 global companies in this category.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Four Chinese entities have suspended operations: the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), and New Development Bank. The total number of entities in this category is 413.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One Chinese firm has departed Russia: DJI, the drone technology company. There are 318 companies in this category.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There continue to be rumors and concerns about potential future violations. According to recent press reports, CNOOC, CNPC, and Sinopec are negotiating to buy Shell’s 27.5 percent stake in the Sakhalin-2 liquefied natural gas venture in Russia. There are also reports that unnamed independent Chinese refiners, or “teapots,” may be using under-the-table schemes to continue to purchase Russian oil through the Eastern Siberia–Pacific Ocean (EPSO) pipeline. Similarly, China’s future use of small regional banks with no connection to U.S. dollar transactions to circumvent the sanctions is a persistent U.S. concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. China-Europe Ties&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s relations with Europe – and especially Europe’s strategic orientation toward China – have been a top diplomatic priority since the invasion. China’s goals have been twofold: (1) to prevent a major and sustained deterioration in relations and to reorient ties back toward trade, investment, and climate, and (2) to prevent European countries and the European Union (EU) from aligning against China. To do so, China launched high-level diplomatic meetings with a flurry of key European policymakers and EU leaders, including those from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the war broke out in late February, Wang Yi had phone calls with his French, British, German, and EU counterparts – which constitute the core group that China is focusing on in its European diplomacy. In those early days, Wang Yi put forward a five-point proposal, largely a holding action, to highlight China’s principled positions. In the proposal, it did call for a “balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism,” which China still references today. This benign- sounding formulation means a reduced role for NATO in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later, and as its ties with Europe deteriorated, China upped the ante. Xi arranged a virtual summit on March 8 with both French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. He then separately had a phone call with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. As the situation in Ukraine worsened throughout March, and amid a variety of meetings and calls between Wang Yi and his core European counterparts, the next big moment came with the annual EU-China Summit on April 1. This was the first such summit since June 2020 and the first time Xi joined Premier Li Keqiang at the summit to meet with European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen (and their top advisers). China also reached out to CEE countries by sending two delegations to the region. Xi hosted a video meeting with German Chancellor Scholz on May 9 and had a call with French President Macron on May 10. China will likely continue this pace of high-level diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all of these meetings, China’s strategy toward Europe has been multifaceted. It has sought to downplay China’s critique of NATO and U.S. policy, to emphasize China’s respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, to reiterate China’s priority for humanitarian support and a negotiated solution, to call for maximum restraint “by all sides,” and, of course, to call for a return to better relations with Europe, focusing on trade, investment, and climate change. In the first month of the war, Chinese diplomats were relieved when a senior EU official floated the idea of China mediating a peaceful outcome. Ultimately, China never accepted the proposal, and EU interest in it quickly faded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese officials also conveyed subtle but unmistakable criticisms of Europe. They represent (1) a call for Europe to appreciate that “the legitimate security concerns of all countries must be taken seriously,” reflecting sympathy for Russian concerns; (2) a call for China and Europe to “work together to reduce the negative impact of the crisis,” which means reducing the severity of the sanctions, and (3) calls for Europe to uphold its “strategic autonomy,” which is a clear message not to align with Washington. Xi was unusually explicit about this at the EU-China Summit when he stated that Europe should “form its own perception of China, adopt an independent China policy, and work with China for the steady and sustained growth of China-EU relations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s diplomacy toward Europe shows little signs of success and increasing signs of being counterproductive. The April 1 summit did not produce a joint statement or any concrete outcomes. The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said the summit was a “dialogue of the deaf,” given China’s reluctance to discuss Ukraine. EU officials were particularly frustrated by Chinese comments that it was a U.S. proxy. Borrell said, “We condemn Russian aggression against Ukraine and support this country’s sovereignty, democracy, not because we follow the U.S. blindly, as sometimes China suggests, but because it is our position … this was an important message for the Chinese leadership to hear.” China fared no better in Central and Eastern Europe where interest in cooperation with China is fading and concerns about China are growing. For example, China cannot find any country to host the ten-year anniversary of the 16+1 meeting. As a further indication of the European reaction, after the April summit several European leaders and the EU launched a flurry of high-level diplomacy with India and Japan, including a new defense agreement between the UK and Japan. The new German Chancellor Scholz made a political statement by traveling to only Japan for his first trip to Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. China, the BRICS, and the Global South&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas China’s post-invasion diplomacy toward the United States, Russia, and Europe has been largely defensive in nature, China’s diplomacy toward the developing world has been focused on pursuing a strategic advantage. Beijing quickly noticed the neutrality of much of the Global South and actively sought to leverage this to China’s benefit. China has focused on appealing to the perceptions and interests of the developing countries and positioning itself as an alternative. China has done so both rhetorically and operationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s gambit has several features. First, China is using the war – and especially the U.S.-led response – to highlight concerns that resonate with the developing countries. These include opposition to “group politics and bloc confrontation,” opposition to “unilateral Western sanctions,” support for sovereignty and the UN Charter, the governance deficits in the West, and the need for global governance reform. In particular, as the global economy faces food shortages, inflation, and supply chain disruptions, China is blaming them on “unilateral Western sanctions.” Le Yucheng was explicit about this in a May speech: “… the U.S. and other Western countries have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia, crippling an already languishing world economy and unleashing unbearable pain on developing countries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these ideas were reflected in a high-profile speech by Xi Jinping on April 22 that Chinese officials call Xi’s “Global Security Initiative” (GSI). Chinese officials and the media refer to it as a new and defining vision for geopolitics and they pair it with Xi’s fall 2021 “Global Development Initiative” (GDI). Beijing is now promoting both the GSI and the GDI as a fulsome offering to the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second approach is to foster diplomatic solidarity among countries that are neutral on the war. China’s first big move on this front was Wang Yi’s March trip to India in the face of U.S. disappointment with Indian neutrality. Wang’s approach was to sidestep border issues and appeal to their common economic interests and shared views of global politics. China’s efforts fell flat. As Foreign Minister Jaishankur stated during the visit, “I was very honest in my discussions with the Chinese foreign minister. …The frictions and tensions that arise from China’s deployments since April 2020 cannot be reconciled with a normal relationship between the two neighbors.” Since then, India has started talks with the United States and the European powers about major arms packages, and it recently pledged to join the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping has been active in this effort as well, indicating its importance to Beijing. Xi held phone calls with South African President Ramaphosa in March and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in April. Calls to both had been infrequent in the past. Xi used these interactions to emphasize their common positions on Ukraine, and he called for cooperation among the BRICS countries on this and other issues. During Xi’s phone call with Mohammed bin Salman, their first in a year, Xi made a notable pitch for a closer strategic alignment, including a greater focus on energy trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third part of China’s diplomatic strategy has been to seek to reenergize the BRICS and Chinese-led regional institutions as venues to criticize U.S. policies and to promote Chinese ideas of global governance. As chair of the BRICS this year, China has been especially active on this agenda. In his comments to the BRICS Foreign Ministers’ meeting in late May, Xi stated, “Facing the various risks and challenges of the day, it is more than ever important for emerging markets and developing countries to strengthen solidarity and cooperation.” At the same BRICS meeting, Wang Yi called for an expansion of the BRICS, perhaps sensing a unique moment in global politics to do so. Wang has raised similar concerns in his meetings with regional organizations, such as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the China-Caribbean Cooperation Forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;managing-the-straddle-the-future-of-chinese-diplomacy&quot;&gt;Managing the Straddle: The Future of Chinese Diplomacy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether China can sustain its strategic straddle is a core challenge – perhaps a defining one – for China’s foreign relations today. There are two basic threats to doing so. One involves China deciding to take sides, likely precipitated by a crisis. The second involves a gradual dissolution of the straddle. As some countries do not align consistently with China or as China faces demands from others, China may find itself struggling on multiple fronts to maintain its middle ground among competing interests and demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the first problem of China taking sides (either in support of Russia or as distinctly neutral), this is a low probability outcome because of China’s strong desire to avoid it. This outcome would likely require a high-impact exogenous event to force China to alter or even abandon its straddle. For example, if the United States were to move substantially closer toward Taiwan, then Beijing might react by aligning overtly with Russia, perhaps in preparation for aggression against Taiwan. A second possibility is that Beijing might overtly provide Russia with material assistance if Putin were to be on the brink of political collapse and Xi felt that Chinese aid could prevent that. Alternatively, China might choose to distance itself from Moscow and to be genuinely neutral if Russia were to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. In such an instance, the overwhelming global condemnation of Russia, especially from the Global South, would likely be too great a burden for China to carry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separate from a willful Chinese decision to abandon the straddle, China faces a collection of risks related to a gradual dissolution of its strategy. This could occur for at least three reasons. First, the fragile equilibrium in the U.S.-China relationship fails to hold, precipitating a deterioration in bilateral relations. Chinese suspicion of U.S. actions toward Taiwan or U.S. distrust of Chinese actions toward Russia could lead to a worsening of ties. In both the U.S. and China, domestic politics is playing a greater role in driving policy making, which could produce greater pressure to adopt more confrontational rhetoric and policies. In a climate of expanding, intensifying, and diversifying U.S.-China competition – fueled by domestic politics – it is difficult to imagine the current fragile equilibrium in U.S.-China ties holding for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second risk is that Russia might need more from China. If Russia were to face mounting military challenges in Ukraine, then it might request military assistance from China. To get such aid, Russia could begin to offer heretofore inaccessible Russian military technical assistance, sweetening the deal for Beijing. This outcome appears to be more probable if China were to become less invested in U.S.-China ties or were it to believe that ties may soon deteriorate. Even more likely is the possibility that Russia may need substantial economic assistance from China as the sanctions take effect. This could require that China take more risky behavior regarding the sanctions, potentially putting Chinese firms at risk of secondary sanctions from Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third risk is that China never gains unique traction with the Global South, precipitating China’s gradual isolation with Russia in a corner of global politics. China may face problems aligning on Ukraine with the developing world, which primarily lack China’s tilt toward Moscow. This could deprive China of the alignment it needs to balance U.S. and European power. Notably, India will keep China at a distance; indeed, New Delhi is already leaning toward the United States and Europe. In addition, China’s ideas may not gain traction with the developing world; most countries remain more attracted to trade and investment with China than to Xi’s ideas for domestic and global governance. China’s economic and COVID-related problems this year also call Xi’s governance choices into question at the very time that he has put them forward as superior to liberalism and capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the challenges China faces in sustaining its strategic straddle on Ukraine are substantial and evolving. Maintaining the straddle will require constant attention and deft management. The challenges also come during a period of domestic uncertainty and leadership transition in China; China’s top two diplomats, Yang Jiechi and Wang Yi, are slated to retire in the next year. Therefore, perhaps an equally important question is not only whether the straddle can be sustained, but, if so, as the war in Europe grinds on, whether China could even translate such a delicate and dynamic balancing act into something that can meaningfully influence the global distribution of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There will be more crises like Ukraine that pull in great powers, spark escalation risks based on fear and uncertainty, and test the viability of integrated deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The longer a conflict such as Ukraine lasts, the less likely it will be confined to one state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The national security community will need to develop tools and techniques for assessing competition, escalation tendencies, and risk attitudes among foreign leaders that combine old concepts from political psychology with new capabilities afforded by data science and natural language processing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on three crisis simulations held in late March 2022 with think tank fellows, military planners, and congressional staffers, The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will likely struggle to address escalation vectors almost certain to push the current war in Ukraine beyond the country’s borders. This paper captures key insights from across these simulations based on two triggering events: (1) a Russian surgical strike on a NATO logistics hub used to provide weapons to Ukraine in southeast Poland, and (2) Russian use of chemical weapons along the Polish border while simultaneously mobilizing to threaten the Baltics. As the conflict crossed a key threshold and risked becoming a regional war, most participants found a natural pull to escalate in each scenario despite limited expectations of achieving a position of competitive advantage. Analyzing how individuals and teams approached decisionmaking provides insights on rethinking escalation models in the twenty-first century and taking advantage of new concepts and capabilities to better support signaling during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This paper introduces the On Future War series. This series uses a combination of traditional strategic studies methods and data science — including survey and natural experiments — alongside crisis simulations and wargames to anticipate how strategic competition is evolving. Each installment will review the results of a wargame or crisis simulation and provide additional statistical insights into how players approached decisionmaking consistent with modern military operations and strategy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine is not confined to the country’s borders. The Kremlin has stated its war aims involve limiting Kyiv from becoming part of a larger transatlantic economic and security block. Russian major general Rustam Minnekaev indicated that the second phase of Russia’s “special military operation” is to establish a land corridor from the Donbas to the pro-Russian breakaway region of Transdniestria in Moldova. Moscow pursues these objectives with military force in Ukraine, nuclear blackmail, and economic coercion. The West continues to send weapons and intelligence to halt the Russian invasion. In this manner, the conflict is an acute episode in the larger rivalry between the United States/NATO and Russia, creating escalation risks beyond the sovereign borders of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the escalation risks in a protracted Ukrainian conflict and how should U.S. policymakers navigate them? Building on previous crisis simulations that evaluated emergent risks in contemporary great power competition, this paper explores how the current conflict could expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still a distinct possibility of escalation in Ukraine. Of the 44 rungs in Herman Kahn’s foundational escalation ladder, the first 20 are nonnuclear and range from sub-crisis maneuvering (e.g., political warfare and gray zone activity) to a spasm or insensate war involving full nuclear exchange. In the early stages, which include conventional proxy conflict, parties engage in competitive risk taking, or what Schelling called “the threat that leaves something to chance,” as they use a mix of diplomacy and military force to get the other side to back down. These threats involve threatening or taking actions that increase the risk geographically (i.e., horizontal escalation) or in terms of intensity (i.e., vertical escalation). The resulting responses need to produce bargaining power to be effective. This dynamic means policymakers need to model and assess escalation risks as they aid Ukraine relative to whether response options increase their competitive bargaining position compared to the underlying risk. In other words, Ukraine is the first test of the Biden administration’s integrated deterrence strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/220526_Jensen_Ukraine_Figure1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Escalation Options&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;game-design&quot;&gt;Game Design&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three crisis simulations held in late March 2022 put over 60 players, each with at least 10 years of national security experience, in the position of making political-military decisions in response to further escalation in Ukraine. The simulation began with assuming a stalemate along the front in eastern Ukraine and had each side — a U.S.-led NATO coalition and Russia — exploring alternatives to achieve a competitive advantage. Players had imperfect information about the intentions of the other side but retained a comparable menu of flexible deterrent and response options, complete with a mix of vertical and horizontal escalation actions (see Figure 1). In U.S. military planning, flexible deterrent options are preplanned crisis responses that provide the ability to scale (i.e., escalate or de-escalate) based on a mix of friendly objectives, the issue at stake, and likely adversary actions. By designing the game around these options, the researchers created a mechanism to measure how escalation dynamics evolve over the course of a conflict such as Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ukraine is the first test of the Biden administration’s integrated deterrence strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each simulation had three rounds designed to assess preferences for flexible deterrent and response options during planning as well as how preferences shifted given possible contingencies. In each round, players selected their preferred option from the menu depicted in Figure 1 and assessed its expected utility (i.e., bargaining advantage) and underlying escalation risk. In this way, the crisis simulation captured the idea of competitive risk, which is at the core of deterrence literature. To produce a competitive advantage, each side selected a flexible deterrent option whose expected utility (i.e., net bargaining benefit) matches or outweighs the risk of further escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the initial planning round, U.S./NATO players selected the flexible deterrent option most likely to contain the crisis to Ukraine, and Russian players selected the option most likely to compel Western nations to stop supplying weapons to Ukraine. From the menu of options in Figure 1, teams selected their preferred responses in relation to the underlying escalation mechanism: vertical or horizontal. They also ranked each option in terms of the expected utility from 1 (low expected benefit) to 10 (high expected benefit and competitive advantage) and in terms of underlying escalation risk from 1 (low risk) to 10 (high risk of escalation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the subsequent rounds, as discussed below, players again selected their preferred flexible deterrent and response option from the menu and assigned it a score in terms of its expected utility and underlying escalation risk. In this manner, the researchers could assess the difference between the expected bargaining advantage and escalation risk across each round. Furthermore, it allowed for a comparison of flexible deterrent option preferences before and after a crisis, capturing the adage that no plan survives first contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In U.S. military planning, flexible deterrent options are preplanned crisis responses that provide the ability to scale (i.e., escalate or de-escalate) based on a mix of friendly objectives, the issue at stake, and likely adversary actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;game-insights&quot;&gt;Game Insights&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the initial planning round, 29 percent of U.S./NATO teams opted to increase weapons transfers to Ukraine, while 20 percent opted to increase air and missile defense along NATO’s eastern and Baltic flank. On average, U.S./NATO teams expected low utility from their deterrent options (4.8 out of 10), but it was higher than the projected risk (4.1 out of 10), producing a favorable bargaining position. The Russian side favored expanding attacks in western Ukraine (50 percent) and conducting cyber operations to target NATO member states actively supporting Ukraine (25 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crisis Vignette: Surgical Strike&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A surgical strike consisting of 10 cruise missiles originating from Belarus hits a NATO logistics hub in Poland. Despite the larger number of NATO combat air patrols and air defenses in the area, the missiles emerged undetected due to jamming and cyber disruptions that occurred during the suspected Russian strike. The cruise missiles appear to have been fired from Belarus, but given recent equipment transfers, intelligence cannot confirm it was fired by a Russian platform with high confidence. The strikes hit a warehouse with NATO member state supplies being staged to ship across the border to Ukraine. There have been no other changes in Russian military posture in Ukraine or Russia’s military districts. The Kremlin is not acknowledging the attack but is stating publicly that aiding the transfer of weapons to Ukraine is an act of war against Russia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the initial planning round, the game used two sequential vignettes to assess escalation dynamics. During the first vignette (see “Surgical Strike” text box), U.S./NATO players responded to a surgical strike on a NATO logistics hub in Poland. In this round, 25 percent of U.S./NATO teams opted to increase air and missile defense along NATO’s eastern and Baltic flank while assessing NATO member states’ appetite for a follow-on attack that varied from counterattacking Russian assets in Ukraine to establishing a no-fly zone over western Ukraine. Alternatively, 16 percent opted for a surgical strike on Russian forces in Ukraine, as opposed to Belarus, to contain the conflict. On average, U.S./NATO teams expected low utility from their deterrent options, consistent with the initial round (4.9 out of 10 compared to 4.8 in the initial round), but the projected risk increased (5.8 out of 10 compared to 4.1 in the initial round).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/220526_Jensen_Ukraine_Figure2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Bargaining Advantage Declines in a Protracted Crisis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in Figure 2, over time, U.S./NATO players assessed a decreased ability to establish a position of competitive advantage relative to Russia. The chart shows the difference between the expected utility and risk for each flexible deterrence option selected in the initial round (blue line) and after the surgical strike (orange line). When the line is above 0, it indicates that participants assessed their flexible deterrent option as producing a net deterrent benefit (i.e., bargaining advantage) relative to the assessed level of risk. When the line is below 0, it indicates that participants assessed that they were assuming more risk than expected utility. The chart illustrates how even rational planners began to make suboptimal choices where their own assessments of risk outweighed their estimates of the bargaining advantage to be gained by employing flexible deterrent options. Calibrating a balanced deterrent response proved difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussions, both the U.S./NATO and Russian teams assessed a need to respond with force, even though they knew it would likely trigger an escalation spiral. Both sides stated they wanted an “off ramp” and a means of pushing the conflict back into territorial Ukraine to avoid a broader, multifront war, although they were unwilling to signal it to the adversary. A major discussion point from both teams was how to keep the conflict geographically confined to Ukraine. Of note, the Russian players discussed finding ways to disrupt staging areas in Poland and lines of communication used to keep Kyiv in the fight. One Russian team said they would prefer sabotage — even using a commercial unmanned aerial vehicle to start a fire at a weapons depot in Poland — to avoid risking an Article V moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crisis Vignette: Chemical Attack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russian forces launch a chemical attack on a city near the Ukrainian border. Prevailing winds blow some of the agent across the border, injuring 10 Polish service members and killing over 50 Ukrainians fleeing to Poland. The Kremlin releases a report blaming the chemical attack on Ukraine and claims Poland supported the effort, creating a need to defend Russians in the near abroad and create a buffer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the second vignette (see “Chemical Attack” text box), U.S./NATO players responded to a Russian chemical attack on Ukrainian forces near the Polish border as well as indications and warnings of a wider Russian military mobilization. In this round, 54 percent of U.S./NATO players opted to execute an immediate large-scale conventional mobilization and expanded deployments to Poland and the Baltic states as a means of signaling Russia and ensuring alliance cohesion. Another 17 percent opted for a surgical strike on Russian forces in Ukraine. Most Russian teams attempted for a second time to pull the conflict back to territorial Ukraine, using horizontal escalation as a bluff to limit NATO options in Ukraine. Russian teams discussed needing to deter U.S./NATO military support for Ukraine. They thought that this would buy them enough time to lay siege to Ukrainian cities and force a favorable concession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/220526_Jensen_Ukraine_Figure3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: U.S./NATO Horizontal Escalation Risks Drive Risk over Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second vignette also illustrated a dangerous tendency toward unintended horizontal escalation over the course of a protracted conflict, even when participants stated they wanted to keep the conflict contained to one country. Despite players on each side stating in discussions that they wanted to keep great power conflict confined to an indirect struggle through Ukraine, each subsequent round revealed a preference for horizontal escalation. Figure 3 illustrates this trend. Each flexible response option for U.S./NATO players was coded in terms of whether it exerted more vertical and horizonal escalation pressure. In the planning phase (Turn 1) — which started from the vantage point of Russia regrouping after its failed push on Kyiv — U.S./NATO players stated a preference for horizontal escalation options, such as increasing air and missile defense and troop deployments along Russia’s border away from Ukraine. U.S./NATO players used vertical escalation to respond to the strike in Poland (Turn 2) but returned to horizontal options so they could gain a bargaining advantage for a response to the chemical attack and the risk of a broader war (Turn 3). This tendency is already on display with a series of mysterious explosions and reports of possible false flag activity designed to help Russia open a new front in Transdniestria. Even if the Ukraine conflict ends in the near term, it will still likely pull NATO into an escalating series of crises with a weakened but emboldened Russia. One such crisis on the horizon is Russia’s response to Finland and Sweden seeking NATO membership, which Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov stated would entail a “military-technical” retaliation. Absent a dramatic turn — such as a diplomatic breakthrough or a palace intrigue in the Kremlin sufficient to curb Putin’s desperate campaign to rebuild the Russian Empire — Ukraine is likely the start, not the end, of a new acute phase of great power competition in Eurasia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new, protracted cycle of crises and conflict will be as much about human psychology as it is the balance of power and correlation of forces. As the crisis simulation advanced, players assessed that they had increasingly poor options and adopted more risk-acceptant behavior, a posture consistent with prospect theory. Prospect theory, a behavioral economics concept identified by Israeli psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahnemann, holds that individuals are not purely rational and tend to calculate cost and benefit from a reference point, rather than a net estimate of costs and benefits. People tend to anchor on the status quo as a reference point, becoming risk acceptant as they try to prevent losses and risk averse as they focus on preserving gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applied to international relations and competition, there are reasons to believe that certain situations will produce risk-acceptant behavior, even as diplomats and leaders seek to pull back to the status quo in a conflict such as Ukraine. The promise of integrated deterrence — combining technology and partners — and even signs that the Kremlin wants to de-escalate may not be enough to overcome human psychology and fear of future losses. This finding reflects a different kind of tragedy in power politics — one that resides in the first image and individual, as opposed to the structure of the international system, and should serve as a cautionary tale to leaders declaring victory in Ukraine. Even if the war ends, the fear remains and leaders from Moscow and Kyiv to Washington and Brussels will move into the next phase with a bias toward escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-implications&quot;&gt;Policy Implications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the insights and analysis from these crisis simulations, in the future . . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crises such as Ukraine could become more frequent and prone to horizontal escalation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NATO will need to ensure it has the capacity to support democracies against authoritarian states and invest in the interoperability across the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Decisionmakers will need new competition and escalation models to evaluate flexible response and deterrent options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The national security community can add science to the art of strategic signaling by calibrating its response and testing how its messaging (i.e., signals) relates to prevailing themes and rhetoric using data science and natural language processing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crises such as Ukraine will become more acute and risk prone over time without investing time and resources into understanding competition and escalation for the twenty-first century. Strategy must start with problem framing and creating a clear description of the ends, ways, and means within the context of a crisis in a manner that allows for clear-eyed assessments of how to achieve a competitive advantage. This process starts with reimagining competition, crises, and escalation in the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the larger national security community needs new models and ways of thinking about deterrence, competition, and risk. Current defense planning and academic analytical frameworks are the legacy of Cold War dynamics that may not match a new era of competition. Unlike the Cold War, nuclear-armed states in a multipolar world will likely use nonnuclear weapons (e.g., cruise missiles, space capabilities, and cyber operations) to produce strategic effects. Beyond capabilities, these studies should bring the individual back in and assess risk attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside efforts to think about coercion and cross-domain aspects of deterrence, the national security community needs more policy-relevant research that brings individual decisionmaking and attitudes toward risk back into how it thinks about great power competition. In particular, strategic analysis needs more crisis simulations and wargames designed as survey experiments to capture how both individuals and groups respond in different scenarios prone to competitive pressure, fog, and friction. These survey experiments enable researchers to bridge the insights of Carl Von Clausewitz’s on war, Thomas Schelling on deterrence, and Daniel Kahnmann on decisionmaking. These studies should put competition front and center and integrate new data and analytic techniques to understand competitive dynamics in a connected world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For integrated deterrence to be more than a bumper sticker, the Department of Defense will need to initiate a new wave of research that evaluates if and how alternating capabilities — to include the emergence of Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) — and partner networks affect crisis decisionmaking. These studies will need to create alternative scenarios that reflect whether promised technological capabilities and advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning materialize, as well as the degree of partner political interests and interoperability. In other words, the national security community needs to revitalize strategic studies for the twenty-first century and integrate best practices from social science, as opposed to relying on thin case studies and broader — and often untestable — generalizations about war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the national security community needs to expand how it plans and tests flexible deterrent options to increase self-awareness about changing risk attitudes and better calibrate response options in a crisis. If the findings of this initial wargame experiment are sound, decisionmakers are likely to find that the optimal bargaining position will decline over time relative to their menu of flexible response options. Since the crisis simulation involved a series of iterated vignettes, a degree of escalation is built into the game. And yet, the findings suggest that how individuals and groups approach crisis response creates more risk-acceptant behavior and a pull toward horizonal escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applied to Ukraine, this means ensuring open, direct engagement, even with the worst regimes; refining signals during a crisis; and preparing now for a much longer war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;diplomacy-and-signaling&quot;&gt;Diplomacy and Signaling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk.&lt;/strong&gt; As politically unpopular as it might be, the United States — not just France — will need to directly engage Moscow. Talking does not mean reducing coercive pressure. Rather, it means clarifying red lines and expected behavior to better frame bargaining positions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test.&lt;/strong&gt; The government should use data science to test signals and rhetoric before making official statements. Leaders must choose their words more carefully and apply best practices from marketing that test how groups receive those words and make sense of them. Recent statements about regime change, alongside imposing costs on Russia in the long term, are counterproductive and would likely have been shown to be so if tested prior to signaling Russia. The fact is much of public signaling — which is central to crisis response — is left to speechwriters and principals, absent empirical testing and natural language processing that evaluates key themes, sentiment, and other vectors to help calibrate the message.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prepare-for-long-term-competition-now&quot;&gt;Prepare for Long-Term Competition Now&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare.&lt;/strong&gt; NATO cannot discount that Russia will move against Moldova or respond with brinksmanship and force to the north, especially with recent statements from Finland and Sweden that they will join NATO. The possibility of horizontal escalation by even a weakened Moscow should be factored into force posture, deployments, and weapons transfers with an eye toward scenarios beyond Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan.&lt;/strong&gt; Longer term, this suggests a need to shift a defense budget likely to be hit with high costs due to inflation toward recapitalization and making the promise of integrated deterrence and JADC2 a reality. Recapitalizing stockpiles and buying interoperability should be prioritized over even nuclear modernization and service-specific initiatives such as the U.S. Marine Corps Force Design, U.S. Army Multi-Domain Task Force, and U.S. Navy’s shipbuilding plan. While each has value, the opportunity cost does not prepare for a protracted crisis likely prone to horizontal escalation and more risk-acceptant behavior. The United States can minimize those risks by becoming a twenty-first-century arsenal of democracy and ensuring free nations can resist authoritarian gambles such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This can be achieved by prioritizing capacity over capability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play.&lt;/strong&gt; NATO needs to leverage the upcoming 2022 Madrid Summit to conduct intra-alliance crisis simulations. These simulations should explore conventional deterrent options under the integrated deterrence framework to help decisionmakers rethink the escalation ladder for the twenty-first century. The simulations should also focus on technical aspects critical to alliance interoperability related to air and missile defense and on ensuring intelligence and targeting capabilities across partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is the beginning, not the end, of a more acute phase of twenty-first-century great power crises. Analyzing the conflict and using it as a jumping-off point for thinking about the future of competition and how best to ensure strategic advantage is a central task of the national security community.&lt;/p&gt;

The national security community will need to develop tools and techniques for assessing competition, escalation tendencies, and risk attitudes among foreign leaders that combine old concepts from political psychology with new capabilities afforded by data science and natural language processing.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/h9n5gXJ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/h9n5gXJ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Futures For A Frozen Conflict</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-05-26-three-futures-for-a-frozen-conflict.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Futures For A Frozen Conflict" /><published>2022-05-26T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-05-26T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/three-futures-for-a-frozen-conflict</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-05-26-three-futures-for-a-frozen-conflict.html">&lt;p&gt;In April, it was not necessarily evident that the slow-moving “frozen conflict”, one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/the-big-story/how-will-the-russia-ukraine-war-reshape-the-world-here-are-four-possible-futures/&quot;&gt;four scenarios we laid out&lt;/a&gt; for how the outcome of the war could reshape the world, was the most likely to materialize. But this is where the conflict has been headed in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also less evident at the time: the level of shock the war would inflict on the global economy, ushering in major food and energy crises. Depending on the duration of the conflict, these effects could prove even worse for the developing world than the 2008 financial crisis. And although the shock waves are hitting Europe harder than the United States, both are in economic trouble. (In Ukraine itself, the United Nations Development Programme &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.undp.org/press-releases/every-day-delayed-peace-will-accelerate-freefall-poverty-ukraine-warns-undp&quot;&gt;has already estimated&lt;/a&gt; that the vast majority of Ukrainians will face “extreme economic vulnerability” by the end of the year if the war continues.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This global economic downturn will likely emerge as an increasingly influential factor in US/NATO decision-making — potentially opening up a rift between Europe, which may seek a swifter end to the war, and the United States, which wants to see Moscow suffer a full defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how could a frozen conflict play out globally over the next two years? Below are three variations on what this scenario might look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-1-ukraine-is-slowly-strangled&quot;&gt;Scenario 1: Ukraine is slowly strangled&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia consolidates its land bridge to the Kremlin-controlled Crimean Peninsula and, without securing complete control of the rest of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, destroys or blocks the port city of Odesa — leaving the country effectively landlocked. Putin continues to bomb infrastructure elsewhere across Ukraine and annexes parts of the south and east, further destabilizing the country as a fully functioning state. He declares a “victory” while successfully suppressing dissent at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenario could further play out like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Putin calls for a ceasefire in early 2023 but is not ready for a peace deal; he still hopes for greater land gains in the future (perhaps connecting to Moldova) as well as concessions from NATO (such as the recognition of Crimea as Russian sovereign territory if residents agree in an internationally supervised referendum). Western sanctions against Russia remain in place, and economic conditions there worsen. But the United States and Europe also plunge into recession, which fuels growing political discontent over inflation and shortages of goods.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A full-scale global food crisis results in spiraling riots and unrest from Sri Lanka to Egypt (where the knock-on effects of the war &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/e033ceba-b1ed-4414-8865-d25254c640dd&quot;&gt;are already being felt&lt;/a&gt;), while trading patterns drastically deteriorate after major exporting nations such as India, Indonesia, and Malaysia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2022/05/17/food-protectionism-is-on-the-rise&quot;&gt;double down on food protectionism&lt;/a&gt;. A slow response from the Group of Seven (G7) nations and the International Monetary Fund exacerbates the debt crisis facing developing nations. Instability grows in Africa and Asia, while leftist politicians surge in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further into 2023, NATO allies continue to send more lethal military aid as Ukraine — which refused Putin’s proposed ceasefire — tries to retake occupied territory. The quality and quantity of this aid tempts Moscow to continue disrupting supply flows into Ukraine, increasing the risk of attacks close to (or even on) NATO territory while widening the conflict between the Alliance and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By late 2023, Western consensus is fraying. Concerned by economic costs, Ukrainian suffering, refugee burdens, and fears of escalation (including the risk of a nuclear attack by Russia), Germany and France lead a multinational effort to press Kyiv to exploring a peace arrangement with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-2-russia-makes-no-gains&quot;&gt;Scenario 2: Russia makes no gains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to increasingly competent Ukrainian tactics — a continuation of those displayed during Kyiv’s defense of the capital, plus a successful counteroffensive in the eastern Donbas region — Russia is pushed back to pre-February 24 areas of control (retaining Crimea and the separatist-occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk) by early 2023. But further gains by Ukraine prove difficult because of entrenched Russian and separatist defenses. Despite Western shipments of more advanced arms, Ukrainian forces make minimal progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenario could further play out like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Facing growing discontent at home over a collapsing economy and an exhausted military angry over repeated operational failures, Putin is under heavy pressure to strike a deal with Ukraine before his hand worsens even more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting in early 2023, Turkey, Qatar, and India — which since 2020 have sought to cast themselves as global peacemakers — press for a ceasefire as the global economic crisis stokes a sense of urgency. But emboldened by its success on the battlefield, Ukraine is resistant while Putin still hopes for a military comeback.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, some European leaders also start quietly pushing for a formal diplomatic framework: French President Emmanuel Macron teams up with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to call for talks in Geneva among Ukraine and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (which includes Russia), plus Germany (modeled on the 2+4 talks on German reunification) to find a solution. Xi and Macron privately try to persuade Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, respectively — dangling the promise of Russian reparations as part of a settlement. Beijing does not want to appear to be undercutting Putin’s plans, but China’s sputtering economy leaves Xi little choice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emboldened by a landslide Republican victory in the November 2022 midterm elections in the United States, a growing number of GOP legislators press for ending US military aid to Ukraine and refocusing Washington’s attention on Beijing as a leading security threat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-3-ukraine-wins-back-nearly-everything&quot;&gt;Scenario 3: Ukraine wins back nearly everything&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of significantly increased Western arms shipments to Ukraine, a collapse in Russian morale at both the tactical and strategic levels, and Moscow’s inability to replace military hardware at the levels needed (thanks to Western sanctions), Russia is pushed completely out of Ukraine except for Crimea, but Kyiv is gearing up to retake the peninsula (which Putin would effectively view as an invasion of Russian territory).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenario could further play out like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a growing risk of Russian nuclear retaliation to halt Western military aid, heightened by Russia’s loss of previously separatist-occupied eastern Ukraine. As Ukraine mounts a planned offensive to recover the Black Sea peninsula, Putin deploys Iskander-M (SS-26) nuclear-tipped missiles there and threatens to use them if Kyiv’s forces advance. Suddenly, World War III becomes a distinct possibility if urgent meditation efforts by France and China to avoid further escalation end in failure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But by mid-2023 — nearly an entire year before he’d hoped to engineer another reelection — Putin’s hold on power at home is threatened by spiraling public anger. Humiliated top military and intelligence officials force Putin to resign immediately but allow him to keep a nest egg and shield him from international prosecution for war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and European Union differ over the question of lifting some sanctions against Russia: Fearing the prospect of a giant North Korea next door (in the form of a deeply isolated Russia), Europe seeks a bargain by relieving sanctions on oil, gas, and other commodities under a quid-pro-quo agreement that portions of the Russian sales be sent as reparations to a Ukraine reconstruction fund led by the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global economic growth falters, reaching a meager 1 percent in 2023 amid increased beggar-thy-neighbor, 1930s-style protectionism, burgeoning nationalism that erodes global institutions, and popular discontent spreading from the United States and Europe to a seething developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens next on the battlefield will determine whether the current largely frozen conflict will eventually advantage Russia or Ukraine. Various military outcomes are still plausible. With so many variables in play, it is difficult to attach probabilities to potential scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in all cases, the economic damage will be profound not just for Ukraine, but also for the rest of the world. Instead of waiting for an outcome to the war, policymakers must urgently explore solutions to the global food crisis, the growing potential for debt crises in the developing world, and the threat of recession in the West. Meanwhile, the risk of Russia using nuclear weapons in the course of the conflict is not zero. Employing diplomatic means to avoid such an escalation is vital if the conflict is to remain contained and not envelop the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5FKefS8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
▲ A Ukrainian soldier salvaging a heavy machine gun from an abandoned Russian tank in the Siversky Donets River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the forest, a short walk revealed bits of torn Russian military uniforms hanging from trees, an eerie reminder of the troops who died violently here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The failed river crossing that took place at this spot over several days in early May was one of the most lethal engagements of the war for the Russian army. Its forces had sought to surround Ukrainian soldiers in the nearby town of Sievierodonetsk — but instead became surrounded themselves, boxed in by the river and a Ukrainian frontline. At least 400 Russian soldiers died, mostly from artillery attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the war grinds across the rolling plains and forests of Eastern Ukraine, the maneuvering of troops has in large part evolved into attempts at entrapment. But as the deadly encounter at the bridge illustrated, the tactic comes with grave risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After failing to capture major cities such as Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, or to cleave off the entire Black Sea coast, the Russian military attempted a major encirclement of Ukrainian troops in the east. That effort is looking difficult now that Ukraine has blocked one main route of advance, near the town of Izium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the Russian forces’ immediate goal has become a smaller encirclement of Sievierodonetsk, the easternmost city in the Donbas region still under Ukrainian control. Artillery bombardments by Russian troops approaching from three sides have ravaged the city, knocking out water and electricity and in the past day killing at least six people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YZ6gqXs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ Destroyed Russian armored vehicles near the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian strategy has been to use the blunt instrument of its army’s vast artillery to pound away at Ukrainian forces, making incremental gains in the Luhansk region of the Donbas. Military analysts and Western intelligence officials believe that Moscow’s forces would face brutal urban combat if they tried to fully capture Sievierodonetsk, and that they would struggle to mount an offensive deeper inside Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encirclement is a harrowing prospect for soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I try not to think about it,” said Pvt. Ivan Sichkar, a Ukrainian soldier surveying the destruction of the encircled Russian force. “If I think of being surrounded, there’s no time left to do anything else.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians’ refashioned goal has focused the battle on a slender, 75-mile front in the Donbas. It is seeking to advance from both the north and the south to close the one remaining supply line for Ukraine into the city of Sievierodonetsk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the Russian army advanced from the south, forcing Ukrainian troops to retreat from the small town of Svitlodarsk, lest the Russians envelop the town and trap soldiers inside. And in its Wednesday evening briefing, the Ukrainian general staff described stepped-up attacks by Russian helicopters and jets to support ground troops in the east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Russia making only halting progress in Ukraine, President Vladimir V. Putin moved Wednesday to shore up support at home, announcing raises in pensions and the minimum wage and making his first trip to meet with wounded soldiers. “They are all heroes,” he said at a military hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Pt6bhk4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ A handgun from the backpack of a Russian soldier found in an abandoned tank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Putin also signed a decree opening a fast track to Russian citizenship for Ukrainian residents of areas controlled by the Russian military, a further step toward annexing territory in southeastern Ukraine that Russia has occupied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Putin moved to reassure ordinary Russians, Ukraine’s Western allies were trying to maintain pressure on his government. In Ankara on Wednesday, talks took place between Turkey, Finland and Sweden over Turkish concerns about the two Nordic countries’ application to join NATO. At a news conference after five hours of negotiations, Ibrahim Kalin, a spokesman for Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said more talks were needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Turkey is not under time pressure,” Mr. Kalin said. “It is not possible for any process to proceed without meeting the security concerns of Turkey.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy of encirclement has yielded far-reaching political gains for Russia over the course of its longer conflict in the region, in which Russian-backed separatists battled Ukrainian forces for eight years before the full-scale invasion this year. Two cease-fires, known as the Minsk agreements and seen as struck on terms advantageous to Russia, followed successful Russian encirclements of Ukrainian troops in the east in 2014 and 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in Bilohorivka, a tiny coal mining town on the banks of the Siversky Donets River, the tables were turned earlier this month, at least temporarily slowing the Russian advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian soldiers who fought in the battle took to calling the site “the ear” for a lobe-like loop in the river where the fiercest fighting took place. The Ukrainian military escorted reporters for The New York Times to the site, which is on a frontline formed in much of the Donbas region by the roiling, fast-flowing river, swollen by spring rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunlight filters through the foliage of a dense, quiet forest on the river’s floodplain, which was the Ukrainians’ kill zone. Mosquitoes buzz. In places, the smell of decaying corpses is overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Russian bodies start here,” Private Sichkar said as he rounded a bend in a dirt road extending about a mile through the forest to the river’s edge. Just in this one spot, 15 incinerated armored personnel carriers were scattered about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Russians wanted some little victory,” Col. Dmytro  Kashchenko, the Ukrainian officer who commanded the counterattack on the pontoon bridge, said in an interview. “They tried in Kyiv, they tried in Kharkiv, and they lost. They were trying to win at least something.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Siversky Donets River, which cuts a meandering path through Eastern Ukraine, forms a natural barrier to Russia’s advances. Suitable sites for pontoon crossings are few, Colonel Kashchenko said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was ordered to one of the crossings on May 8, after the Russians deployed pontoons and moved soldiers into the forest on the near bank. Ukrainian infantry advanced into the area the next day, but were repulsed, suffering losses, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They then set up a defensive line to box in the Russians as they crossed their pontoon bridge, and rained down artillery fire on the area. They also set about destroying the bridge by placing floating mines upstream, allowing the current to carry them to the Russians’ pontoons, which proved an effective tactic. The Ukrainian forces blew up four separate bridges at the crossing site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians hastily laid new pontoons and sent armored vehicles across, Colonel Kashchenko said, but they were unable to break through the Ukrainian defensive line. Dozens of armored vehicles and infantry soldiers became trapped and were mauled by Ukrainian artillery. The Ukrainians also hit Russian troops involved in the bridge work on the far shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bombardment included some of the first barrages from a newly arrived American artillery gun, the M777, Colonel Kashchenko said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2lqAg0D.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ The body of a Russian soldier on the riverbank. Russia took heavy losses there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colonel Kashchenko said he had offered the enemy forces a chance to surrender, shouting into a loudspeaker, “‘Russians, give up!’” But, he said, “I don’t know if they heard us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some enemy soldiers escaped by swimming across the river, the Ukrainians said. The Ukrainians have yet to collect the remains of the Russians scattered around the forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mottled light sifting through the leaves, discarded food and personal items lay all about: a sleeping bag, bottles of shower gel, cans of beef, a bag of potatoes, Russian tea bags, flip-flop sandals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian soldiers found a certificate for a medal granted to a Russian colonel for earlier fighting in the war. It was called an “award for military excellence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beside a disabled Russian tank lay a cardboard box apparently used for carrying supplies. On the box was an odd message for a unit in war: “Always believe something wonderful is about to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, former supreme allied commander in Europe, drew a distinction between the Ukrainian tactics of seeking to target Russian armored vehicles and troops with artillery and the Russian bombardments of towns and cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the big scheme of things, Ukraine is trying to do maneuver warfare to regain territory and cut off resupply routes,” General Breedlove said. “And Russia is doing more of a grinding, attrition-based warfare.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of Russia’s bungled pontoon crossing, he said, “the Russians did something poorly that is difficult even if you do it magnificently.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He will likely then state, directly or obliquely, that Russian doctrine permitting the use of nuclear weapons to defend Russian territory applies to those newly annexed territories. Such actions would threaten Ukraine and its partners with nuclear attack if Ukrainian counteroffensives to liberate Russian-occupied territory continue. Putin may believe that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would restore Russian deterrence after his disastrous invasion shattered Russia’s conventional deterrent capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s timeline for annexation is likely contingent on the extent to which he understands the degraded state of the Russian military in Ukraine. The Russian military has not yet achieved Putin’s stated territorial objectives of securing all of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and is unlikely to do so. If Putin understands his military weakness, he will likely rush annexation and introduce the nuclear deterrent quickly in an attempt to retain control of the Ukrainian territory that Russia currently occupies. If Putin believes that Russian forces are capable of additional advances, he will likely delay the annexation in hopes of covering more territory with it. In that case, his poor leadership and Ukrainian counteroffensives could drive the Russian military toward a state of collapse. Putin could also attempt to maintain Russian attacks while mobilizing additional forces. He might delay announcing annexation for far longer in this case, waiting until reinforcements could arrive to gain more territory to annex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine and its Western partners likely have a narrow window of opportunity to support a Ukrainian counteroffensive into occupied Ukrainian territory before the Kremlin annexes that territory. Ukraine and the West must also develop a coherent plan for responding to any annexation and to the threat of nuclear attack that might follow it. The political and ethical consequences of a longstanding Russian occupation of southeastern Ukraine would be devastating to the long-term viability of the Ukrainian state. Vital Ukrainian and Western national interests require urgent Western support for an immediate Ukrainian counteroffensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kremlin-plans-to-annex-southern-ukraine&quot;&gt;Kremlin Plans to Annex Southern Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin likely intends to annex occupied southern and eastern Ukraine directly into the Russian Federation in the coming months to consolidate his control over these territories and possibly deter Ukrainian counterattacks. The Kremlin likely plans to annex much of the Ukrainian territory currently occupied by Russian forces — portions of Kherson and Zaporizhia oblasts in the south and the areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in the east that Russian forces and their proxies control. Moscow may also annex other Kremlin proxy statelets like South Ossetia (in Georgia) and Transnistria (in Moldova). ISW has previously detailed the ongoing Kremlin conditions-setting to annex or recognize occupied Kherson, Zaporizhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk. That conditions-setting includes replacing local media with Kremlin-run media outlets, installing Russian internet and communications networks, forcibly transitioning local economies to the Russian ruble, kidnapping, executing, and replacing local Ukrainian officials with Russian collaborators, and likely hunting and eliminating anti-occupation activists and partisans. Widespread Russian atrocities against Ukrainian civilians are part of the established Kremlin playbook to gain control over occupied areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin no longer conceals its intentions to annex areas of occupied Ukraine. The secretary of United Russia, Putin’s political party, visited Kherson on May 6 and announced that “Russia is here forever.” The Russian-appointed deputy head of the Kherson Civil-Military Administration, Kirill Stremousov, announced on May 11 that Kherson would develop a legislative framework for joining Russia by the end of 2022 and would entirely forgo a public referendum after reports that Russian occupation authorities were preparing for a fraudulent Kherson independence referendum. He said that the international community did not recognize Russia’s (rigged) referendum on annexing the Crimean Peninsula after Russian forces invaded and captured that Ukrainian territory in 2014, and that a Kherson referendum was therefore unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stremousov said aloud what Russians have tried to obfuscate: Russia will annex Kherson despite widespread local opposition to annexation. Stremousov’s statement shows that the Kremlin likely realizes any attempt to conduct a “referendum” in Kherson would be met with widespread resistance even after months of Russian brutalization and intimidation of the local population. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov did not contradict Stremousov in a May 11 press conference, stating that the Russian annexation of Kherson “must have an absolutely clear legal background, justification, [and] be absolutely legitimate, as was the case with Crimea” but explicitly did not mention a referendum. Russian-appointed Kherson regional head Volodymyr Saldo said on May 9 that “if the Russian Federation is here, then the entire set of laws, the structure and construction of power will be precisely Russian.” He said that he expected “some kind of [Russian] federal district will be created, which will include the Crimea, Kherson, and Zaporizhia regions,” though the Kremlin is not bound to administer an annexed Kherson Oblast in this manner and regularly contravenes the stated expectations of its other proxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin has many models for the governance of annexed territories based on Russia’s complex and varied federal system. Occupied territories could be incorporated as oblasts (the administrative unit roughly analogous to American states that comprise most of Russia), republics (like the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula), federal cities (like Russia’s two main cities of Moscow and St Petersburg and the city and naval base of Sevastopol), or an entirely new organizational structure. The Kremlin could also choose to first turn occupied territories into proxy “people’s republics” as an intermediate step, or offer a phased path to annexation. ISW cannot currently forecast which path to annexation the Kremlin will likely pursue, but the recent Russian official comments noted above suggest that outright annexation is currently the most likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin’s planned wave of annexations could also include proxy territories outside Ukraine. The newly elected leader of South Ossetia, one of two Russian proxy regions in Georgia created and defended by the Russian military during and after the 2008 Russian invasion of Georgia, said on May 11 that he awaited a Russian “signal” to hold a referendum on joining Russia. His predecessor said in his concession speech on May 9 that his government had already submitted paperwork to prepare and determine a date for the accession referendum. Officials from Abkhazia, the other Russian proxy state in Georgia, said on March 31 that they support but do not share South Ossetia’s aspirations to join Russia, indicating that Abkhazia will likely not be included in a Russian annexation sweep. Separately, US National Intelligence Director Avril Haines warned on May 10 that Putin seeks a land bridge to the Russian proxy Moldovan breakaway region of Transnistria, but does not currently have the military capabilities to achieve that goal. The Kremlin may approve Transnistrian annexation or recognize the independence of the self-declared Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic to set conditions for future operations in Moldova or southwestern Ukraine. Such Russian actions would likely follow the establishment of military control of occupied Ukraine and take account of the fact that Russia almost certainly lacks the military capability to seize the parts of Ukraine, including Odesa, that would be necessary for such a land bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;costs-and-benefits-of-annexation-for-russia&quot;&gt;Costs and Benefits of Annexation for Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The direct Russian annexation of any areas of occupied Ukraine would permanently change the pre-invasion legal frameworks codified in the Minsk II Accords and preclude returning to any sort of status quo antebellum. It would thereby cost Putin the opportunity he pursued doggedly from 2014 to 2022 — attempting to insert Russian proxies (the DNR and LNR) into the Ukrainian political system as permanent levers of influence. Outright annexation of Ukrainian territory would foreclose the resurrection of the legal frameworks outlined by the Minsk II accords, which depended on treating Russia’s proxy statelets as parts of Ukraine and requiring Kyiv to grant them both autonomy and the rights to participate in the Ukrainian political system. Putin’s recognition of the “independence” of those statelets immediately before the February invasion has already formally changed the situation, to be sure. But whereas one might theoretically imagine Putin trading that “independence” for a return to the Minsk II framework, it is almost impossible to imagine him accepting a retrocession of territory he has formally annexed to the Russian Federation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Putin annexes the occupied territories, therefore, he will have decided to give up the option of using proxies within the Ukrainian political system to resume the hybrid war approach he had taken toward Ukraine since 2014. He would likely make such a decision because he knows his latest invasion has already destroyed any possibility of returning to those Kremlin-favorable frameworks, because he fears a Russian military collapse, or because he seeks to restore credible Russian deterrence by introducing a nuclear threat — or all three. Regardless of Putin’s reasoning, Russia cannot — and will not — accept a return to a pre-war status quo. If the Kremlin directly annexes Ukrainian territory, it will mark a fundamental departure in the Kremlin’s approach to Ukraine, from hybrid warfare and political manipulation to outright military coercion and, if possible, conquest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annexation of Ukrainian lands is likely the only “off-ramp” that Putin is interested in pursuing at this time. Even this face-saving option, which falls far short of the Kremlin’s initial war aims of complete regime change in Kyiv, would be a devastating blow to Ukraine and is likely the minimum outcome that the Kremlin is willing to accept. If Putin can declare victory by annexing large swathes of Ukrainian territory, he can better sell the costs of the war to the Russian population and to any sympathetic global audiences. The Kremlin absurdly justified its unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine as defending the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics from Ukrainian “Nazi” aggression and an alleged planned genocide against Russian speakers. The Kremlin likely assesses it must therefore consolidate and justify its gains by annexing at least the currently occupied portions of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts if it seeks to maintain that narrative and claim that it achieved the war’s stated objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Russian annexation would seek to present Kyiv with a fait accompli that precludes negotiations on territorial boundaries even for a ceasefire by asserting that Russia will not discuss the status of (illegally annexed through military conquest) Russian territory — the argument the Kremlin has used regarding Crimea since 2014. The Kremlin did not seriously engage in its perfunctory negotiations with Ukraine in Istanbul in March and April. After annexing Ukrainian territory, the Kremlin will frame Ukrainian negotiators’ demands for the return of Ukraine’s sovereign territory as absurd requests for Russia to give up its own land and dismiss them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Russian military collapse combined with further Ukrainian battlefield successes or the Kremlin’s acceptance that a military collapse is imminent are likely the only other circumstances under which Putin would accept something less than his stated objectives for this phase of the war. Collapse does not necessarily mean a mass surrender or rout of the Russian military. A Russian military collapse would more likely be roughly analogous to the state of the French army from April to June of 1917 during the First World War, when over half the divisions in the French army refused to go on the offensive due to shattered morale and poor leadership. Russian forces in such a state would be extraordinarily vulnerable to concentrated Ukrainian counteroffensives, and the Ukrainian military would be able to pick the battles of its choosing if Russian forces were unwilling to attack. A Russian military collapse would likely involve an endemic level of desertions and “fragging“ of officers, the practice of personnel killing their own officers, both of which have been observed throughout the war. Such a collapse would render further offensives impossible in the current phase of the war in Ukraine and could lead to a disorderly withdrawal of Russian forces from the front lines, as was seen following the Russian loss in the Battle for Kyiv. The Russian military will not be completely destroyed, nor would it have to leave Ukraine before reaching a state of collapse. However, a collapsed Russian military would lose its ability to function as a coherent fighting force. If that happened, Putin might well find himself obliged to accept far less than his current stated objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;timing&quot;&gt;Timing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin has set partial conditions for annexation in areas like Kherson and Zaporizhia and has actually had to rein in some of its proxy officials from the DNR, LNR, and South Ossetia as they clamor for annexation. But the Kremlin has not yet formally announced annexation or the formation of new proxy republics in those areas. The Kremlin must set certain political and military conditions before it can annex occupied territories. Military realities could force a change in timeline or in pacing, however, and Ukrainian military gains in the east could drive a quicker annexation of specific areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin likely intends to annex all of the territories it wants to incorporate into Russia at once, rather than stagger the annexation process. The Kremlin likely believes that mass annexation would minimize the longevity of international outrage. The international community eventually normalized relations with Russia following its 2008 invasion of Georgia and the stagnation of its 2014 invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea; Putin would likely seek to replicate that pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin will need to establish relatively comprehensive security and administration structures within its occupied territories before it can announce effective annexation. Unexpectedly stiff Ukrainian resistance in occupied Mariupol’s Azovstal steel plant, as well as anti-occupation protests and partisan activities in Kherson and other occupied areas, have likely slowed the Kremlin’s intended timeline. The Kremlin likely expects strong backlash in occupied Ukrainian territories when it declares formal annexation and therefore is seeking to break up partisan and opposition groups before going forward with annexation, likely through the population-control efforts of Rosgvardia forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin must also work to transform its military occupation of Ukrainian territories into a series of political administrations capable of governing newly minted Russian regions before it can formally annex those territories. This process will take time as the Kremlin crushes opposition movements, arrests or kills off local Ukrainian officials, eradicates local governance structures, and replaces them with Russian administrators or Ukrainian collaborators. The longer that Russian forces have to control and subdue occupied Ukrainian territory, the more difficult it will be for Ukraine to rebuild local administrative and governance structures in those areas if they can regain control. The political clock on Ukraine’s ability to regain control of the southeast is ticking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian head of the Kherson region said in a May 9 interview that the formation of a regional government was underway. He claimed that there was no widespread or organized violence in Kherson, only “separate manifestations.” These claims (likely exaggerated) may indicate that occupation forces, probably including Rosgvardia troops, have cracked down on Ukrainian resistance and partisan activities in the region, enabled by Russian control of communications infrastructure. The degree of success of those Russian crackdowns, or of ongoing Ukrainian partisan activities, is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin also likely needs to address internal disagreements on administrative boundaries and organization before formally annexing Ukrainian territory. DNR head Denis Pushilin claimed on May 9 that Mariupol “is the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic forever. No one will take it away from us.” However, conflicting Russian and Ukrainian reports on May 3 suggest that other Russian decisionmakers may be planning to annex Mariupol directly into Russia’s Rostov oblast, rather than into the DNR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intended-effects-of-annexation&quot;&gt;Intended Effects of Annexation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin could threaten to use nuclear weapons against a Ukrainian counteroffensive into annexed territory to deter the ongoing Western military aid that would enable such a counteroffensive. The Kremlin has already falsely claimed that Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory — during an unprovoked war of Russian aggression against Ukraine — are somehow escalatory rather than a legal Ukrainian response under the laws of war. However, Russian nuclear doctrine clearly allows for nuclear weapons use in response to “aggression against the Russian Federation with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy.” The Kremlin could frame a Ukrainian counteroffensive into annexed Ukrainian territory as a threat to the existence of the Russian state — such an absurd claim would be no less plausible than many other claims Russia has already made. Making that claim, however, likely necessitates Russian annexation of occupied territories, rather than creating additional proxy statelets in places like Kherson and Zaporizhia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin could believe that a nuclear threat would deter ongoing Western military aid that would enable such a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Ukraine and the West should not let that happen. The Kremlin has likely calculated that NATO would rhetorically and materially support Ukrainian counteroffensives into a hypothetical proxy statelet Kherson People’s Republic (or simply Russian-occupied Ukraine), but would not support Ukrainian attacks into the Kherson Oblast of Russia, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin may also believe that Kyiv would be unwilling to directly attack claimed Russian territory, particularly after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 27 that Ukraine would not try to recapture all Russian-held territory by force, arguing that it could lead to a third world war. Zelensky has repeatedly called for the restoration of the de facto borders as of February 23, the day before Russia’s latest invasion. The Kremlin could conceivably believe that annexation would prevent Ukrainian counteroffensives, even without an explicit nuclear threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-supporting-effort&quot;&gt;Military Supporting Effort&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to enable the annexation of occupied Ukrainian territories, the Kremlin must accomplish the following military objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hold and consolidate control of occupied territory. This objective necessitates the disruption of partisan activities and the defense of held territories.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stop Ukraine from retaking additional territory. The Kremlin will likely order Russian forces to settle into defensive positions once Kremlin officials accept that the Russian campaign in Donbas has reached its culmination point — if they ever do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Kremlin may not have acknowledged that its military campaign in Donbas has stalled. The Kremlin may still believe that its forces can take the rest of Ukrainian-held Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. The Russian proxy head of the DNR claimed on May 9 that the DNR is “faced with the task of regaining control over its territories, and then the republic will decide on its future — almost certainly referring to accession into Russia”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces are continuing ineffective offensive operations in eastern Ukraine despite the vanishingly small chance that they will make any substantial territorial gains. The Kremlin is likely operating under one of the following mindsets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It erroneously assesses that Russian forces can complete their stated objective — the complete capture of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts; or&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has realized that Russian forces will be unable to completely capture Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts but is continuing to order attacks in order to maintain momentum and prevent the fragmentation of Russian forces; or&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is planning a larger mobilization of lower-quality Russian reserves or the general population in order to accomplish its original territorial objectives, forcing a months-long delay for additional Russian forces to arrive and turn the tide (or so the Kremlin might believe).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ongoing Russian attacks, though ineffective, do achieve the military objective of pinning Ukrainian defenders in place by threatening further advances. Kyiv may be unwilling to risk pulling the forces it would need to conduct a counteroffensive against occupied southern Ukraine from areas that are currently under Russian attack. If Russian forces accept that they will gain no additional territory in Ukraine and settle into defensive positions themselves, Ukrainian forces will gain an opportunity to seize the initiative and choose where to launch counter-offensives against the depleted Russian forces, which may collapse in the face of a determined counterattack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;forecast&quot;&gt;Forecast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We assess that the remainder of this phase of the war in Ukraine will likely follow one of three courses: either Russian forces will annex occupied Ukrainian territory into Russia, the Russian military will stall for time as it attempts to mobilize additional forces, or the Russian military will continue to pursue impossible military objectives with insufficient resources and ultimately collapse in the coming months. Mobilization does not preclude military collapse. Many of the dangers outlined in this assessment hinge on a Russian recognition of its conventional military weakness and a proactive decision to secure Russian gains in Ukraine. Putin’s mistaken decision to invade Ukraine despite Russia’s poor preparation and conventional military capabilities suggests that the West should not rely on clear-eyed Russian assessments of their own military capabilities. Ukrainian forces may be able to force Russian forces out of occupied Donetsk and Luhansk, or at least back to the pre-February borders of the DNR and LNR, if Russian forces do not decide to end their offensives early. If Russian forces make the deliberate choice to end their offensive before the Ukrainian military forces them to do so, that decision would be a strong indicator of imminent annexation. If Russian forces fail to recognize that their Donbas campaign has culminated, the Russian military in Ukraine may be headed for an outright collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces will likely either decide to end their offensives in Donetsk and Luhansk and annex the territory they currently hold or they will be militarily defeated by Ukrainian forces. If Russian forces stop shy of capturing the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, the Kremlin will owe the Russian population an explanation as to why it did not achieve its stated objectives. The false Kremlin narrative of an anti-Russian “genocide” in eastern Ukraine traps Russian decisionmakers if they care about narrative consistency: they must “rescue” sufficient territory to claim to have stopped the “genocide” in order to claim victory. Alternatively, the Kremlin could calculate that domestic support for the end of the war is unimportant to its aims and simply claim a victory that is inconsistent with the Kremlin’s running narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-implications&quot;&gt;Policy Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its conventional military failures, the only off-ramp the Kremlin appears to be considering is at least partial victory. Putin likely understands that there will be no return to the Minsk II accords or any similar legal framework that allowed for Russian interference in Ukrainian politics. But Putin has not ceded his longer-term ambition of controlling Kyiv, even though his attempts to take the Ukrainian state by force have failed (for now). If Putin annexes occupied territory and the conflict settles in along new front lines, the Kremlin could reconstitute its forces and renew Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in the coming years, this time froPolicy Implications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West must take seriously the real and likely threat that Russia will annex southeastern Ukraine and the expand Russian nuclear doctrine to cover that newly annexed territory. Russia’s annexation plans are not guaranteed to succeed. They depend on consolidating control of occupied territory, establishing administrative capabilities, and preventing a Ukrainian counteroffensive. The West must do what it can to deter Putin’s expansionism while also preparing an answer that offers Ukraine more than capitulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine and its Western partners likely have a narrow window of opportunity to support a Ukrainian counteroffensive into occupied Ukrainian territory before the Kremlin annexes that territory (or brings up additional forces). This window of opportunity is not necessarily obvious. In a military sense, Ukrainian forces should begin their counteroffensive before Russian forces decide that their campaign has culminated and begin to dig into more orderly and possibly morale-boosting defensive positions. Poor morale and worse leadership have soundly degraded Russian forces; Ukraine should ideally counter-attack at the time of maximum Russian disorder before Russian forces have time to fully go over to the defensive and dig in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political and ethical consequences of a longstanding Russian occupation of southeastern Ukraine would be devastating to the long-term viability of the Ukrainian state and necessitate Western support for a more immediate Ukrainian counteroffensive. Every day that occupied Ukraine remains under Russian control is another day of horrific human rights abuses, targeted degradation of Ukrainian governance structures, and “filtration” of civilian populations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Although U.S. strategic competition with China and Russia is often presented as a challenge with two separate fronts, this brief argues that the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific theaters are increasingly linked.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Insofar as preserving a favorable balance of power in these two regions hinges largely on U.S. power, and as long as they both continue to exercise a significant pressure on U.S. defense resources, their alliance and deterrence architectures should be looked at from an inter-theater perspective. Thus, optimally managing a two-front challenge would require a serious effort to bridge U.S.-led alliances in both regions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine, and the need to deter further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe, has triggered a debate about the United States’ ability to adequately resource a much-needed rebalance to Asia and prioritize strategic competition with China. For some, Ukraine is a dangerous distraction: the United States should avoid getting bogged down in Europe, lest it incentivize Beijing to engage in opportunistic aggression in Asia. According to this line of thinking, deterrence in Asia, and the security of the United States’ Indo-Pacific allies, hinges on U.S. restraint in Ukraine and in Europe more broadly. Others, however, argue that a hot war and the prospect of further military aggression will inevitably compel the United States to strengthen its posture in Europe in the foreseeable future. This does not mean that Washington should take its eyes off China. Rather, it should prepare to deter and win a war on two fronts simultaneously. A Russian failure in Ukraine could conceivably change U.S. calculations over the medium term and even lay the groundwork for a proper strategic rebalance to Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should the United States establish a clear priority between Russia and China or go all in on both fronts? What are the implications of each option for U.S. defense strategy? And where do the United States’ European and Asian allies come into the picture? U.S.-allied dominance at sea and the preservation of favorable balances of power in Europe and East Asia should be seen as interdependent concepts or parts of a “geostrategic trinity” of power, upon which the open, rules-based international system largely rests. As long as preserving a balance of power in Europe and East Asia hinges largely on U.S. power, and as long as these two regions continue to exercise a significant pressure on U.S. defense resources, their alliance and deterrence architectures will probably remain intertwined. The question is not so much which region matters most or under which circumstances. The unraveling of the balance of power in one region would punch a hole in the U.S.-led forward defense perimeter in Eurasia, endanger U.S.-allied dominance at sea, and eventually threaten the balance in the other region. Hence the United States’ European and Asian allies have a stake in the preservation of favorable balances of power in each other’s region and in U.S. maritime dominance more broadly. It is also why the U.S.-led deterrence and alliance architectures in Europe and Asia should be looked at from an inter-theater perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;U.S.-allied dominance at sea and the preservation of favorable balances of power in Europe and East Asia should be seen as interdependent concepts or parts of a “geostrategic trinity” of power, upon which the open, rules-based international system largely rests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted the mobilization of countries such as Japan, Australia, and South Korea, who have joined the sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union and provided their own support to Ukraine. Building on such political momentum would allow to promote an inter-theater approach to deterrence and alliances in Europe and East Asia. Critically, such an inter-regional approach can allow the United States and its allies to collectively navigate the two-front problem and adequately resource deterrence in Europe and East Asia simultaneously. Even though mutual defense commitments may remain intra-regional, as opposed to inter-regional, greater coordination between U.S.-led alliances in the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific could help ensure an optimal allocation of U.S. and allied strategic resources. Specifically, both sets of alliances should upgrade consultation mechanisms at the political and military levels and apply an inter-theater lens to burden sharing, force planning, and posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;two-competitors-two-fronts&quot;&gt;Two Competitors, Two Fronts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States recognizes both China and Russia as “long-term strategic competitors” and warns specifically about the threat they pose to their immediate neighbors — many of whom are U.S. treaty allies — and the existence of favorable regional balances of power. This challenge is arguably further compounded by Sino-Russian military cooperation and the prospect of “coordinated probing” — the notion that Russia and China could engage in aggressive behaviour in Europe and East Asia simultaneously, so as to “outflank” the United States. Against this backdrop, there is an intense debate in scholarly and policy circles about how geostrategic developments and U.S. security commitments in Europe are likely to affect those in East Asia and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever lessons recent history may offer, they are imperfect at best. To be sure, the United States also faced the challenge of simultaneously upholding the deterrence and alliance architectures of Europe and East Asia during the Cold War. However, the main threat referent in each region at that time was the same great power competitor: the Soviet Union. If the United States felt it had to step up its contribution to one region (e.g., Europe) in response to a perceived increased Soviet threat therein, it would not need to worry too much about disattending the other region. After all, Soviet resources were also limited, and a Soviet prioritization of Europe would automatically limit Moscow’s strategic bandwidth in East Asia. Thus, the United States faced a two-front competition during the Cold War but not two significant (great power) competitors in two different regions. A key challenge today is that both competitors have more capabilities in aggregate than anything the United States and its allies faced during the Cold War, precisely because of China’s rise and Russia’s nuclear arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World War II may be a better analogy. The United States also sought to heed off the prospect of a regional hegemon in Europe and East Asia. However, this analogy is also inadequate for several reasons. First, World War II was a shooting war, while the United States is currently focused on peacetime competition with China. Second, the United States joined a war that was already under way. Third, even though the United States had wartime allies, it did not have preexisting alliances or forward-deployed forces in either region in peacetime, allowing it to focus on deterring wars. And fourth, the United States’ wartime allies (notably Soviet Russia and Great Britain) were significant powers by global standards, even comparable to U.S. adversaries. World War II may thus only offer limited clues about how Washington could navigate competition with Russia and China in peacetime, whereby preexisting alliances and U.S. force deployments in Europe and East Asia are important, even critical factors. How, then, should policymakers think about the current process of strategic competition?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enter-ukraine&quot;&gt;Enter Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has reignited long-standing debates about U.S. geostrategic priorities. At the risk of oversimplifying, there are two broad camps or prisms: “China first” and “two-front war.” Some experts and scholars argue that the United States should prioritize the China threat in Asia and warn that getting bogged down in competition with Russia in Europe would pave the ground for Chinese opportunistic aggression in Asia, most likely in Taiwan. Others contend that the United States can walk and chew gum at the same time and should in fact be ready to deter and win “two high-intensity wars” simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The China first vs. two-front war debate is partly misguided. Advocates of both camps actually appear to agree on some important points. There seems to be a consensus that the United States has a fundamental interest in preserving a balance of power in both Europe and East Asia — two regions that boast the largest concentration of economic, industrial, and military power in the world outside North America. With few exceptions, most experts also seem to agree that Asia should come first, regardless of whether the current crisis in Europe may require more U.S. bandwidth in the short term, for two main reasons. The first relates to China’s economic size and technological development and the fact that its bid for regional hegemony in East Asia goes beyond the military domain. Russia lacks China’s economic or technological heft, and the threat it poses to European security is primarily a military one, which for now is mainly confined to Russia’s immediate neighborhood. Second, and critically, East Asia’s security and geopolitical architecture is much more fragile than Europe’s. The U.S. defense perimeter in East Asia enjoys limited depth. China’s territory hugs the Western Pacific, and with the exception of Japan and Taiwan, there is little standing between China and U.S. forces in the Pacific. This contrasts with the surplus of strategic depth the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) enjoys in Europe, encompassing much of the north European plain, Europe’s two main “internal seas” (the Mediterranean and Baltic), and approaches from the North Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;unpacking-china-first-vs-two-front-war&quot;&gt;Unpacking China First vs. Two-Front War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the China first and two-front war prisms seem to share some basic geostrategic assumptions, the crux of the matter is how much to prioritize one region at the expense of the other and what that may mean for U.S. defense strategy. Taking this premise as a starting point, the debate lines appear to be sharpening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advocates of the two-front war approach typically argue that the nature of the threat the United States and its allies face in Europe and East Asia is very similar. The focus should thus be on deterring and defeating a great power competitor. That may generate clear trade-offs with threats such as terrorism, which require a very different approach to force structure and defense strategy more broadly. But ultimately, the business of great power deterrence is not all that different regardless of whether the threat referent is China or Russia. These two competitors share a great deal. They both intend to carve out their own spheres of influence by dominating their near abroad; both are nuclear powers; both are investing in anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities to hinder U.S. access and movements in their respective neighborhoods; and both often resort to hybrid or gray zone warfare, aiming to undermine the security of U.S. regional allies without triggering a military response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because the China first and two-front war prisms seem to share some basic geostrategic assumptions, the crux of the matter is how much to prioritize one region at the expense of the other and what that may mean for U.S. defense strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because China and Russia share key aspects of their worldviews, have been coordinating their positions, and are pursuing similar types of capabilities and strategies, whatever steps the United States ought to take to deter one competitor will automatically reinforce deterrence vis-à-vis the other. Of course, China and Russia are different, and so are Europe and East Asia. There is no single approach to great power deterrence that is fit for all competitors or theaters — the United States and its allies will need to account for geographical and other specificities. However, the bulk of U.S. operational concepts and capabilities can arguably be leveraged against both competitors. Specifically, nuclear modernization, long-range strike assets, and dominance at sea, in space, or in the cyber realm all seem critical to preserving deterrence in Europe and East Asia. The fact that such capabilities are by and large fungible, and are often based on the continental United States, only underscores their potential in any great power-related contingency, whether in Europe, East Asia, or elsewhere. Relatedly, the development of new technologies and capabilities such as theater-range offensive or defensive missile systems are promising in both European and East Asian contexts, regardless of the more mundane question of whether more of those units should be deployed in one region at the expense of the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A China first prism puts the emphasis on “real trade-offs” and on the notion that setting clear priorities is the essence of strategy. According to such perspectives, Washington must prioritize those threats that matter most because U.S. resources are limited. This is particularly relevant in a context of alleged “relative decline.” The United States may well possess an impressive suite of global strategic capabilities that are good for all seasons, competitors, or theaters. However, those capabilities can hardly be available in multiple locations simultaneously — losses incurred in one contingency or region limit the forces available to other regions, underscoring the risks of opportunistic aggression in undefended areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important element of the China first vs. two-front war debate has to do with how U.S. allies in Europe and East Asia perceive Washington’s extended deterrence commitments in each other’s region and whether uneasiness about U.S. commitments can undermine allied cohesion. Thus, for instance, calls for “European strategic autonomy” have been fueled by the perception that the United States is set to rebalance to Asia over the long term to prioritize competition with China, which raises questions about the sustainability of its security commitments in Europe. Those advancing China first arguments in the United States are probably more likely to embrace the notion that Europe can defend itself. Regardless of the obstacles that may stand in the way of a meaningful European defense effort, proponents of China first may be ready to take the risk because they believe the United States should focus on Asia anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another argument in support of China first has to do with the importance of tailoring U.S. strategy around specific competitors. The best competitive strategies leverage the proclivities and weaknesses of specific competitors and seek to design operational concepts and capabilities to exploit such weaknesses. During the Cold War, the United States invested heavily in a bomber force so as to exploit Soviet fears and incentivize Moscow to invest in expensive air and missile defenses, hoping to push it to the losing side of a “cost competition.” Because China is more advanced technologically and its population is less sparse than the Soviet Union’s, deterring or outcompeting Beijing in East Asia may require prioritizing different kinds of capabilities or operational concepts. The challenge is not just making good on commitments in different regions simultaneously but also that the capabilities required for each competitor and theater can be very different in nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a recent NATO Defense College report, “Europe and East Asia represent two different operational theaters: Europe is primarily a land theater, providing enormous strategic depth and surrounded by seas; Asia is, especially on its Eastern part, conversely a coastal, peninsular and insular area, where countries have . . . little strategic depth and depend significantly on seaborne trade.” Preserving deterrence in Europe thus “calls for some specific capabilities, where land forces play a dominant — although not unique — role,” whereas deterrence in Asia requires “long-range logistical capabilities and, overall, a force structure more based on sea and air power.” According to this logic, a U.S. military rebalance toward East Asia would “change the economics of defense in Europe as the different investments, technologies and training required for Asia reduces the room for scope and scale economies.” Such arguments can admittedly cut the other way, in that each theater having different requirements plays against the idea of trade-offs. This is particularly true given the bureaucratic tendency to ensure each U.S. armed service gets a piece of the defense pie: the Navy can prioritize Asia, the Army can focus on Europe, and the Air Force — and Marine Corps — can act as the “swing force.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debate on where the line falls between military-strategic synergies and trade-offs is an important one. But it should not overlook a broader point, namely that changes in the balance of power in Europe or East Asia are likely to have a pervasive effect, even if indirectly, on the other region. This is because the alliance and deterrence architectures that underpin security in each region hinge ultimately on U.S. and allied dominance at sea and over the other global commons and because preserving such dominance requires maintaining favorable balances of power in both regions. If the balance of power is upended in either region, U.S. and allied dominance at sea would be at peril, which would eventually endanger security in the other region. To grasp the importance of such links, U.S. and allied dominance at sea should be understood as the connecting tissue between the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific deterrence and alliance architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;back-to-basics-the-role-of-sea-power&quot;&gt;Back to Basics: The Role of Sea Power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that one of the main purposes of sea power is to create strategic and political effects on land runs through the work of most theorists of sea power. This means that a power that enjoys maritime dominance should be in a position to project power into key continental enviroments and underpin favorable balances of power therein. Conversely, forward engagement in key continental environments helps create the conditions for sustainable sea power. After all, engaging forward and preserving a balance of power in key regions constitutes the first line of defense for a sea power. In this vein, Nicholas Spykman argued that the United States’ ability to use the seas freely — and indeed the very defense of the continental United States — hinged on two key factors: a strong navy and the preservation of a balance of power in the two most prosperous and economically dynamic regions of the Eurasian “rimland” (i.e., Europe and East Asia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two important concepts must be clarified: maritime dominance and balance of power. Maritime dominance implies the ability to move freely at sea in times of war and peace, as well as to project military force into key rimland regions. It also presumes the ability to deny or significantly restrict a competitor’s access to and movement at sea. This is an ideal-type concept, for a power hardly ever enjoys full freedom of access and movement at sea or the ability to fully deny such freedom to potential competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A balance of power refers to a situation whereby no single power dominates a given geographical space, in this case a region. It is important to emphasise the importance of agency. Balances of power hardly ever emerge naturally. From the viewpoint of a sea power, a balance of power needs to be favorable, which essentially means it should hinge on its involvement and role. As Brendan Simms’s detailed historical account of the rise and fall of the First British Empire (1714–1783) shows, whenever Britain set its eyes on the high seas and apart from Europe — hoping a balance of power on the continent could perhaps sustain itself — other powers would fill the void and eventually threaten the balance, forcing Britain to intervene and pay a high price in power and treasure further down the line. The corollary is that forward presence and deterrence make for more economical strategies than offshore balancing, no matter how tempting the latter may be for a sea power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-states-as-a-sea-power&quot;&gt;The United States as a Sea Power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the end of World War II, a strong navy and command of the other global commons (air, space, and cyber) have allowed the United States to articulate a network of alliances in Europe and East Asia from a position of strength. The relationship between U.S. power and such alliances is mutually symbiotic. U.S.-led alliances have become a key foundation of U.S. power and geostrategy, as they allow Washington to economize resources and ensure the order’s sustainability over the long term. This requires sharing power with allies and consulting them politically, including in the crafting of military strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. allies in Europe and Asia do not just have a stake in favorable regional balances and U.S. dominance at sea — they have become critical to the preservation of both. Indeed, the bilateral naval and military balances between the United States and China or the United States and Russia paint an incomplete and overly stark picture. The balance looks quite different to Beijing and Moscow when the other allied navies and military forces are added, and more so if other allies from the other side of the Eurasian rimland join in. Thus, U.S. allies are co-tenants in a system whose center of gravity is U.S. economic and military power but where allied participation is key. U.S.-led alliances are thus premised on solid geostrategic foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;U.S. allies in Europe and Asia do not just have a stake in favorable regional balances and U.S. dominance at sea — they have become critical to the preservation of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-and-allied-maritime-dominance-at-play&quot;&gt;U.S. and Allied Maritime Dominance at Play&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, U.S. and allied maritime dominance and the preservation of a balance of power go hand in hand. U.S. and allied dominance over the main maritime approaches to the European continent, namely the Atlantic Ocean, Baltic, and Mediterranean, provides the foundation for U.S. forward presence in Europe through a network of bases and alliances whose main institutional manifestation is NATO. Those alliances and bases are critical to the preservation of a balance of power in Europe. Conversely, the preservation of a favorable balance of power in Europe is the best way to safeguard U.S. and allied dominance over the continent’s maritime approaches as well as dominance at sea more broadly. The logic cuts both ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar rationale applies to East Asia. U.S. and allied dominance over the main maritime approaches to the East Asian rimland (i.e., through Singapore, the Philippines, Taiwan, the Ryukus, and the Japanese archipelago) has been the foundation of forward presence in the region. Japan stands out as the hub of U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps presence in Asia. So does Australia, which provides a secure geostrategic rear and is likely to become increasingly important for U.S. force posture in the region if China’s A2/AD capabilities continue to threaten U.S. posture in North and Southeast Asia. The system of U.S.-led alliances and bases is indeed critical to the preservation of a favorable balance of power in East Asia. Conversely, preventing the emergence of a regional hegemon is the best way to safeguard U.S. and allied dominance in the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upending of the regional balance of power in either Europe or East Asia would inevitably draw the United States to strengthen its posture therein, thus limiting its strategic bandwidth in the other region. If preserving a balance of power in Europe and East Asia remains a core U.S. and allied geostrategic objective, and if it continues to hinge mostly on U.S. military power, the security and deterrence architecture of these two regions will remain intertwined. Sino-Russian cooperation further compounds this fact. Deterrence and U.S. alliances in Europe and East Asia should therefore be thought of from an inter-theater perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bridging-allies-preliminary-thoughts&quot;&gt;Bridging Allies: Preliminary Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing the two-front challenge optimally would require a serious effort to bridge U.S.-led alliances in the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific, notwithstanding the existing asymmetries in how U.S.-led alliances in Europe and East Asia are structured, as well as the important caveat that security commitments are likely to remain intra-regional as opposed to inter-regional. Such a bridging effort could entail a number of actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upgrading political consultation mechanisms between the United States and its Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific allies would enable discussion about common threats and how to address them, the sharing of relevant intelligence, and the establishment of political-strategic foundations for greater military cooperation (see below). It would also make it easier to share relevant lessons in deterrence between the two competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inter-regional initiatives such as the Australia-UK-U.S. (AUKUS) group — which brings together key U.S. allies in the Euro-Atlantic and Asia Pacific — or the UK-Australia-New Zealand-Malaysia-Singapore five power defense arrangement (FPDA) are certainly useful. So are calls to expand the role of Japan or France in Five Eyes, an intelligence partnership comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such initiatives will remain particularly appealing for those allies that enjoy more intimate ties. However, it is important to broaden the bridging effort. NATO’s existing dialogue with its four Asia-Pacific (AP4) partners (Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea, and New Zealand) offers much potential in this regard. Notwithstanding the relevance of bilateral, tailor-made channels (e.g., NATO-Japan, NATO-Australia), a NATO-Asia Pacific Council could provide a useful forum to bring together all the key allies in both regions. This could involve regular meetings of the foreign and defense ministers of NATO and its AP4 partners but also meetings at the ambassadorial level — that is, between the North Atlantic Council and AP4 ambassadors to NATO in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critically, regular political consultations should facilitate a convergence of views between both sets of alliances on Russia, China, and their evolving relationship and ideally result in a collective framework and narrative to navigate such challenges. This could help mitigate the risks inherent in the idea of “leaning on China to restrain Russia” in the short term or, for that matter, “leveraging Russia against China” in the long term. Beyond the pitfalls or merits of any such ideas, it is important that both sets of alliances have a common picture on Russia, China, and how their relationship may evolve. For one thing, and without ignoring existing frictions, if the Sino-Russia relationship remains broadly cooperative, attempts to drive a wedge may prove challenging. The broader point, however, is that whatever the United States and its allies think they can do in relation to engaging Russia or China, or manipulating their relationship, they must remain aligned. Otherwise, there is a risk they may draw different conclusions about either power’s trajectory or how their relationship may evolve and thus frame their policies on the basis of different premises. This could even conceivably trigger a competition between the United States and its allies, and among the allies themselves, thus endangering the geostrategic trinity of U.S. and allied power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An upgrade in inter-allied political consultations could also help foster a collective approach toward challenges that are global in nature, such as nuclear or ballistic proliferation, proliferation in space and cyber, the governance of artificial intelligence and other disruptive technologies, arms control, or questions related to freedom of navigation. A joint approach toward these challenges would help preserve U.S. and allied dominance at sea and over the other global commons. Specifically, the United States and its Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific allies should promote a joint agenda in relation to the global commons, including in key areas such as freedom of navigation and the open and responsible use of space and cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An upgrade in inter-allied political consultations would also lay the groundwork for greater military coordination. Specifically, the United States and its allies should look at burden sharing, capability development, force structure and posture, and even operational planning from an inter-theater perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An inter-theater approach to burden sharing would allow cooperation to move past allied demands for the United States to be more present in their respective regions or, for that matter, U.S. calls for their allies to spend more on defense. Indo-Pacific allies have a stake in Euro-Atlantic allies sharing the burden and vice versa. And they all have a stake in an adequate U.S. presence in each other’s region to ensure the balance holds. The key question is what the optimal distribution of capabilities and forces is to preserve dominance at sea and favorable regional balances of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some experts have made the case for taking into account “output” metrics in the transatlantic burden-sharing debate, so as to consider allied contributions to actual operations instead of focusing exclusively on how much each ally spends on defense (i.e., input). One way would be to assess allied contributions to defense planning objectives as defined in NATO’s Defense Policy Planning Process (NDPP), which sets collective targets based on an operational assessment. This approach could also be applied from an inter-theater perspective to ensure a more efficient allocation of U.S. and allied resources within and across regions as well as in defense of U.S. and allied dominance at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there is no NATO or anything like the NDPP in Asia, a permanent link between the AP4 partners and the NDPP would provide U.S. allies with a better idea of existing military gaps in each other’s region or at sea, help them anticipate undue pressures on U.S. strategic bandwidth, and identify ways to address or mitigate such pressures. This should also help stimulate greater inter-allied cooperation on questions related to force structure and posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first sight, the United States’ European and East Asian allies should increase their defense spending and efforts and probably do the heavy lifting on the front line (especially in Europe). For its part, the United States would actively support such efforts through strategic capabilities (e.g., command and control; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; strategic nuclear deterrence; ballistic missile defense; and cyber deterrence) and by maintaining a significant presence in both regions, even though Asia may require more direct U.S. resources and possibly even some European ones. Additionally, the United States would take the lead in preserving supremacy at sea and over the other global commons that enable strategic power projection over both regions, and allies would play a supporting role in that regard. While such generic concepts may appear intuitive, the devil is in the detail. An NDPP-AP4 link would ensure such generic concepts can develop and adapt on the basis of a dynamic strategic and political environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An inter-theater approach to capability development can help preserve the dominance of U.S.-led alliances in both theaters. Even though some U.S. capabilities are global, others will be theater-specific and require adaptations. For instance, “theater-range” missiles may need to adapt to specific range or platform requirements (i.e., sea-borne vs. land-borne) depending on whether they are intended for Europe or Asia. This applies to both offensive and defensive missiles. Including allies in U.S.-led capability planning initiatives can generate economies of scale and make it easier for the United States to develop skeleton concepts that can draw on allied support and participation to bring about appropriate adaptations for each theater. Moreover, the need to preserve dominance at sea and in other global commons should also incentivize inter-allied cooperation in developing naval, air, cyber, and space capabilities and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strengthening links between U.S.-led alliances in the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific in the area of operational planning would give both sets of allies greater insight into the military-strategic picture in each other’s region and how such a picture may affect U.S. and allied planning in real time. It would also allow them to assess possible implications for their home region and identify opportunities to add value in each other’s region, as well as in underpinning U.S. and allied dominance at sea and in the other global commons. Thus, allies could consider the establishment of permanent liaison officers from AP4 countries in Supreme Allied Command Europe and throughout NATO’s command structure, as well as a NATO liaison cell in U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and more joint exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, an effort to bridge U.S.-led alliances in the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific would help transcend the China first vs. two-front war dilemma and allow the United States and its allies to develop an optimal collective strategy to underpin the geostrategic trinity of their power. This becomes particularly relevant when the United States and its allies face two strategic competitors in two distant regions simultaneously and in light of Sino-Russian strategic cooperation. Should one of those competitors collapse, or should there be a breakdown in Sino-Russian ties, the need for alliance bridging may indeed become less evident or urgent. Hence, policymakers should pursue flexible and pragmatic approaches to bridging allies that eschew creating new institutions and respect the primacy of regional frameworks, which are arguably more lasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is establishing economic, governmental, and informational control over occupied Ukrainian territory, indicating that Russia may be preparing to create a series of Russian proxy “people’s republics” and/or to directly annex some occupied Ukrainian territory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin continues to falsely claim that Ukraine is stalling negotiations that the Kremlin is also not seriously pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine may suspend negotiations entirely in the coming weeks in response to Russian-sponsored “independence referendums” in occupied Ukrainian territory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian forces are likely considering the use of chemical weapons to achieve battlefield advantages in the battle for Donbas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian false-flag attacks in Transnistria and missile attacks in Odesa likely do not indicate an imminent Russian escalation in Transnistria or Moldova. The Kremlin likely intends to pin Ukrainian forces in the south to prevent them from reinforcing eastern Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is likely attempting to consolidate control over and surveillance of Russian government officials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin continues to project economic confidence to its domestic audience despite a Russian Central Bank report that Russia’s economy will constrict by 8-10% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin made an example out of Poland and Bulgaria by cutting off natural gas shipments in an attempt to coerce Germany, Italy, and other EU consumers of Russian natural gas to pay for their Russian gas imports in rubles, thereby propping up Russia’s sanctions-battered economy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NATO and EU countries continued supplying Ukraine with military assistance, including high-end capabilities to counter Russian aggression, as Sweden and Finland consider NATO membership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin’s antisemitism may drive Israel away from its current neutral position on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-events&quot;&gt;Key Events&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-occupation&quot;&gt;Russian Occupation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is establishing economic, governmental, and informational control over occupied Ukrainian territory, indicating that Russia may be preparing to create a series of Russian proxy “people’s republics” and/or to directly annex some occupied Ukrainian territory. Russian forces are transitioning occupied territories to use the Russian ruble. Occupying military forces do not typically replace local currencies, but Russia’s proxies in occupied Ukrainian territory, the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR), have used rubles in some capacity since 2015. Russian forces are also likely planning to falsify “independence referendums” to create new proxy republics or to annex occupied territories into the DNR, LNR, or Russia itself. To that end, Russian forces are supplanting local governance and beginning to establish greater control over Ukrainian communications and culture in occupied areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Switching to Russian Currency: Russian occupying forces in Kherson implemented a four-month transition period to switch the city’s currency to Russian rubles rather than Ukrainian hryvnias as of May 1. Russian sources reported that stores in Russian-occupied Melitopol and Volnovakha are beginning to transition to the Russian ruble as of May 1. The Ukrainian GUR separately reported on April 24 that Russian forces are introducing ruble payments in occupied parts of Kharkiv Oblast and are encouraging residents to buy products and medicines from Russia. Permanent Crimean Representative to Russia Georgy Muradov had previously claimed on April 6 that Crimea and Russian-occupied southern Ukrainian territories had “restored a single economic complex” and replaced the hryvnia with the ruble.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Falsifying Referendums: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned on April 22 that Russian forces are collecting the personal data of Ukrainians in southern oblasts to help falsify planned referendums. Ukraine’s Southern Operational Command reported on April 26 that Russian forces collected the personal information of residents of Kherson and Mykolaiv oblasts to falsify the results of future Russian-rigged referendums. Ukraine’s General Intelligence Directorate (GUR) reported on April 30 that the Kremlin is planning an independence referendum to create a new proxy republic in Kherson and, eventually, in Zaporizhia and Odesa oblasts. The US Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Michael Carpenter, said on May 2 that US intelligence has “highly credible” reports that Russia will try to annex Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts by mid-May and may attempt to create a similar proxy republic in Russian-occupied Kherson.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Replacing Local Governance: The Ukrainian mayor of Kherson City reported that Russian occupation forces replaced the mayor and the regional governor on April 26 with Russian proxies. Russian forces have repeatedly replaced Ukrainian officials with Russian proxies after occupying Ukrainian territory. Separately, the head of the Russian proxy Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR), Denis Pushilin, said on April 28 that the DNR is working to distribute DNR passports to residents of the “newly liberated” territories. The DNR claims to control Mariupol and other Russian-occupied cities in Donetsk Oblast and will likely adopt greater administrative control of newly captured areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Controlling Communications: Russian forces in Kherson and parts of Zaporizhia likely imposed an internet blackout around May 2 and reportedly cut fiber optic cables in the area, likely to limit freedom of information. Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) reported on April 24 that Russian occupiers are installing Russian-operated MegaFon equipment in Kharkiv Oblast, likely to tighten control over telephone and internet networks in areas that Russian forces currently occupy or intend to occupy after planned offensive operations. The Kremlin also likely intends to sever cultural ties between Russian-occupied territories and the Ukrainian state in the long term; the only school that has remained open in Mariupol was likely forced to stop teaching the Ukrainian language and will only teach Russian as of April 28.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;kremlin-narratives&quot;&gt;Kremlin Narratives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin may be setting conditions for the partition of Ukraine if Russian forces can capture and hold larger parts of eastern and southern Ukraine. Russian Foreign Intelligence Service Head Sergey Naryshkin began promoting a new narrative on April 28: that NATO is planning to use “peacekeepers” to invade Western Ukraine and eventually annex part of the country into Poland. Naryshkin was often at the forefront of pre-invasion Kremlin propaganda narratives but has been largely sidelined since the invasion began, possibly due to Russian intelligence failures. Naryshkin’s re-emergence at the forefront of a new Kremlin information campaign indicates that the Kremlin may be shifting its rhetorical efforts to justify annexing captured Ukrainian territory by claiming that NATO intends to annex parts of Ukraine as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Ukrainian MP and longtime Russian propagandist Alexei Zhuravko claimed on May 4 that Ukraine’s Southern provinces have “always” historically gravitated toward Russia and will not return to Ukraine. He claimed that Kherson, Mykolaiv, and Odesa will also leave Ukraine, setting conditions for a possible Russian annexation of those regions, either directly into Russia or as proxy states. Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin claimed on May 3 that Kherson and other regions do not want to be part of Ukraine, which he framed as fractious. Volodin claimed that many western Ukrainians had accepted Hungarian and Polish citizenship. Former Ukrainian MP Ilya Kiva, who defected to Russia at the start of the invasion, claimed on May 3 that a new, pro-Western Ukraine would form with its capital in Lviv and would then hold a referendum to accede to Poland. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed on May 4 that Ukraine must “recognize the territorial realities” in eastern Ukraine and should respect “the legitimate and conscious choice of peoples and the right of nations to self-determination.” Russian media also amplified a May 4 claim by Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Secretary (NSDC) Oleksiy Danilov that Hungary believed it could annex part of Ukraine during the conflict. State media linked Danilov’s claims to Naryshkin’s claims of a Western plot to partition the country. The Hungarian Embassy in Ukraine condemned and denied Danilov’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces are likely considering the use of chemical weapons to achieve battlefield advantages in the battle for Donbas. The Kremlin increased its condition-setting for the use of chemical weapons in a false-flag attack in eastern Ukraine between April 22 and May 4. ISW assessed on March 9 that the Kremlin had set rhetorical conditions to conduct a chemical or biochemical false-flag attack within Ukraine for which it would blame the Ukrainian military or NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First Russian Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Dmitry Polyansky claimed on April 26 that the White Helmets, a Syrian humanitarian aid group that has been the subject of a sustained Kremlin disinformation campaign, are already present in Ukraine and are preparing false-flag chemical provocations for which they will blame Russian forces. The Kremlin and the Russian-backed regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have repeatedly used chemical weapons against civilians in Syria and blamed opposition and aid groups, particularly the White Helmets, for either conducting or fabricating the attacks and may be preparing to make similar claims in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Polyansky additionally claimed on April 26 that Ukraine may covertly use chemical weapons to gain a tactical advantage in certain areas and claimed that Ukraine had planned to do so at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol before Russian leadership called off their direct assault. He claimed that Ukraine may overtly use weapons of mass destruction on a larger scale to turn the tide of the war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian Radiation, Chemical, and Biological Protection Forces Chief Igor Kirillov falsely claimed on April 23 that Ukrainian forces used a drone to conduct a chemical weapon attack on Russian forces on April 21, and additionally blamed the United States for encouraging the attack. Kirilov claimed the United States is preparing additional provocations to accuse Russia of using chemical, biological, or tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin continues to falsely blame Ukrainian forces for planning or conducting “provocations” in areas where Russian forces intend to commit or have already committed atrocities. The Kremlin likely seeks to introduce doubt into future attributions of war crimes and to diminish global support for Ukraine by blaming Ukrainian forces for crimes already committed by Russian forces. The Kremlin likely also intends to negatively portray Ukrainian forces to the Russian population to maintain domestic support for the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kremlin officials and media outlets reiterated their claims on April 26 that Ukrainian forces might stage nuclear incidents at Ukrainian nuclear power plants and that alleged US biolabs are developing new biological weapons on Ukrainian territory. Russian Investigative Committee Chairman Alexander Bastrykin falsely claimed on May 3 that the United States has provided $225 million to fund Ukrainian bioweapons programs since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian National Defense Management Center Head Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev claimed on April 22 that Ukrainian forces staged a video “provocation” in the village of Voskresenskoye near Mykolaiv to accuse Russian forces of looting in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin continued to reframe its invasion of Ukraine as a NATO-led proxy war of Western aggression against Russia, likely to build domestic support for Russia’s invasion and to coerce Western states into reducing their support to Ukraine by threatening international escalation. Kremlin Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed on April 22 that the United States is not interested in peace in Ukraine and that the West is doing everything it can to escalate the war. Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the United States and its allies of trying to “split Russian society” on April 25. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov argued on April 26 that NATO is conducting a proxy war against Russia in Ukrainian territory and warned that the risk of World War III is “considerable.” The Kremlin is increasingly framing its war in Ukraine as one with NATO to justify Russian battlefield failures and likely to intimidate Ukraine’s international partners by threatening escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is also falsely framing itself as a mediator and a de-escalatory party in the war of Russia’s own making. Russian Foreign Deputy Minister Yevgeny Ivanov said on April 25 that Russia’s current task is to prevent major military conflict in the world and framed the war in Ukraine as an opportunity for Russia to rebalance the global balance of power. Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov claimed on April 25 that Russia seeks to stabilize its relationship with the United States. Lavrov said on April 29 that the West has “encouraged the aggressive anti-Russian course pursued by the Kyiv authorities” and pushed Ukraine to use force to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Lavrov added that Russia does not believe that it is at war with NATO, but that NATO and the European Union believe they are at war with Russia (contradicting statements by other key Kremlin figures). Lavrov claimed that Russia does not threaten any state with nuclear weapons but that a war between Russia and NATO would increase the risk of a nuclear escalation, framing NATO and the EU as aggressors. Russia’s chief delegate to military security and arms control negotiations in Vienna, Konstantin Gavrilov, claimed on May 4 that the West could conduct nuclear or biological “provocations” in Ukraine because the divide between Russia and the West is “existential” and “a clash between good and evil.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin directly threatened NATO with retaliation for Ukrainian counterattacks into Russia to deter continued Western support to Ukraine. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed on April 28 that “the West openly calls on Kyiv to attack Russia using … weapons received from NATO countries” and that Western encouragement has led Ukraine to conduct attacks against Russia itself. Zakharova warned that “further provoking Ukraine to strike at Russian targets will certainly lead to a harsh response from Russia.” Russian state television programs mapped out the time it would allegedly take Russian missiles to reach London, Berlin, and Paris on April 29 in a likely attempt to deter additional European military aid to Ukraine. The Kremlin continues to falsely claim that Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory — during an unprovoked war of Russian aggression against Ukraine — are somehow escalatory or a war crime, rather than a legal Ukrainian response under the laws of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian false-flag attacks in Transnistria and missile attacks in Odesa likely do not indicate an imminent Russian escalation in Transnistria or Moldova. The Kremlin likely intended to pin Ukrainian forces in the south to prevent them from reinforcing eastern Ukraine. Likely Russian forces began false-flag attacks in the Russian-occupied Transnistria region of Moldova on April 25, as ISW has chronicled in its daily military campaign updates. Russian state media also set rhetorical conditions for Russian intervention or escalation in Transnistria, which borders southern Ukraine. The Kremlin likely intended this psychological campaign to keep Ukrainian forces deployed to southern Ukraine in case of a Russian attack through Transnistria, which would almost certainly fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;negotiations&quot;&gt;Negotiations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin will blame Ukraine and the West for stalling peace negotiations, but likely has no intention of halting combat operations unless Russian forces can take additional territory in Ukraine’s east and south. Three people briefed on conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin told the Financial Times on April 24 that Putin “has lost interest in diplomatic efforts to end his war with Ukraine and instead appears set on seizing as much territory as possible.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on April 26 that the war will eventually end with a treaty, but that “the parameters of this treaty will be determined by the stage of hostilities at which this treaty will become a reality,” implying that the Kremlin intends to make territorial gains in order to impose harsher terms on Ukraine in an eventual peace settlement. Lavrov additionally claimed Ukraine is uninterested in negotiations and is being pushed by the West to continue its war with Russia. Lavrov told Chinese media on April 29 that NATO countries are doing “everything they can” to prevent a political solution to the conflict. Lavrov warned that NATO “should come to their senses and stop supplying weapons and ammunition to Kyiv” if NATO countries want to end the war. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on May 4 that negotiations had made no progress and that Ukrainian “inconsistency” in the negotiations process had caused Moscow to doubt whether a deal can be reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine may suspend negotiations entirely in the coming weeks in response to Russian-sponsored “independence referendums” in occupied Ukrainian territory. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned on April 23 that Ukraine would pull out of negotiations if Russian forces “destroy” the civilian population of Mariupol or hold “pseudo-referendums” in occupied territories. Russian forces are likely scheduling a rigged independence referendum in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Kherson to take place in early May. The implementation of the planned Kherson referendum or widescale Russian atrocities against civilians in Mariupol would likely prompt the Ukrainian government to formally suspend negotiations. However, this will likely have little tangible effect, as negotiations are already largely stalled and Kyiv is highly unlikely to accept an outcome less than a Ukrainian military victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-domestic-opposition-and-censorship&quot;&gt;Russian Domestic Opposition and Censorship&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is likely attempting to consolidate its control and surveillance of Russian government officials. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on April 25 establishing the use of a new information system, Poseidon, to collect and analyze activities to “prevent corruption” and “other offenses” in government and government-adjacent agencies. The Kremlin will likely use Poseidon to increase its control over the outer rungs of the Russian government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin continued its crackdown on Russian journalists and domestic freedom of information to ensure continued domestic acceptance of its invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Russian court arrested Kremlin critic and opposition journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza in Moscow on April 22 for spreading “false information” about the Russian Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Moscow court fined the Wikimedia Foundation, which owns Russian Wikipedia, 5 million rubles on April 26 for refusing to remove information about Russian war crimes and civilian targeting in Ukraine, as well as information on how to produce gunpowder, from Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Saint Petersburg court sentenced Russian journalist Maria Ponomarenko to pre-trial detention on April 27 after she shared a social media post about the Russian bombing of a theater in Mariupol that contained Ukrainian civilians. Russian authorities charged Ponomarenko with spreading “fake news about the Russian military.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;US intelligence agencies reported on April 28 that Russian intelligence orchestrated the April 7 attack on Dmitri Muratov, the editor of the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta. Russian intelligence is likely conducting an intimidation campaign against Russian journalists to deter coverage of the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-reactions-to-sanctions&quot;&gt;Russian Reactions to Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin continues to project economic confidence to its domestic audience despite a Russian Central Bank report that Russia’s economy will constrict by 8-10% in 2022. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed on April 29 that Russia has “withstood the pressure” of anti-Russian sanctions and that the financial situation in Russia “is already stabilizing.” The Russian Central Bank predicted 18-23% inflation in 2022 but reported that it expects economic recovery in 2023 as the Russian economy restructures. The Kremlin released additional sanctions measures on May 3 that retaliate against “unfriendly” states and foreign officials, likely to portray Russian sanctions to a domestic audience as effective against the West. The Kremlin also likely seeks to negotiate additional economic ties with Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) member states, both to produce military components for Russia and to launder Russian exports through CSTO markets to avoid international sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies are attempting to force Russia to use up its foreign currency reserves as part of Western sanctions to weaken Russia’s ability to economically sustain its invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin made a last-minute bond payment in dollars on April 29 to avoid default after failing to force foreign creditors to accept payments in rubles. The European Commission said on April 22 that some companies may be able to pay Gazprom in euros and then convert the payments into rubles to avoid a complete cutoff of Russian natural gas imports to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin made an example out of Poland and Bulgaria by cutting off natural gas shipments in an attempt to coerce Germany, Italy, and other EU consumers of Russian natural gas to pay for their Russian gas imports in rubles, thereby propping up Russia’s sanctions-battered economy. Russian state-owned gas company Gazprom announced that it would cut off natural gas shipments to Poland and Bulgaria on April 27 after both countries refused to pay for the gas in rubles. Other EU member states supplied gas to the countries to make up for the shortage. However, a complete Russian natural gas shutoff to the EU (which receives approximately 40% of its natural gas from Russia) would severely damage the European economy without further measures to substitute Russian gas supplies with other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe is meanwhile attempting to wean itself off of its reliance on Russian energy; European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on May 4 that EU member states are considering a phased ban on Russian oil. Particularly oil-reliant states like Hungary and Slovakia are likely seeking exceptions or prolonged timelines for the phased ban. Greece began construction on its second natural gas terminal on May 3. Such terminals empower Europe to receive natural gas imports from abroad and will help limit long-term reliance on Russian natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drivers-of-russian-threat-perceptions&quot;&gt;Drivers of Russian Threat Perceptions:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO and EU countries continued supplying Ukraine with military assistance, including high-end capabilities to counter Russian aggression, as Sweden and Finland consider NATO membership. The Kremlin continued to frame this aid as an escalation against Russia; Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed on April 28 that Western military supplies to Ukraine threaten the security of the entire European continent. The Kremlin continues to reiterate that Western military aid shipments are legitimate military targets in a likely attempt to deter additional military aid shipments, but Russian forces have not demonstrated the capability to consistently interdict Western aid shipments. The Kremlin also attempted to tap into US partisan divides that thus far have not affected US support to Ukraine, likely to manufacture a US political dispute over additional US military and economic aid to Ukraine. Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev claimed on April 28 that US President Joe Biden’s $33 billion aid package to Ukraine will be “sewed” among corrupt Ukrainian oligarchs and the US Democratic Party, including Biden’s son Hunter Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sweden and Finland will likely submit simultaneous applications for NATO membership the week of May 15-22, according to Swedish and Finnish media reports on April 25. Finland Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto stated on April 29 that Sweden and Finland could increase their military cooperation in the Baltic Sea if security deteriorates generally or is triggered by the two countries’ application to join NATO. Neither state is likely to make a final decision before a planned May 13 Swedish parliamentary report. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova warned on May 4 that Finnish and Swedish admittance to NATO would “turn into a space of confrontation” between NATO and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Biden Administration requested $33 billion from Congress in supplemental funding aimed at supporting Ukraine on April 28. The funding includes $20.4 billion in military and security aid, $8.5 billion in economic aid, and $3 billion in humanitarian aid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin stated on April 28 that the Pentagon is trying to find ways to send additional artillery and air defense weapons to Ukraine since the Pentagon has predicted that long-range weapons capabilities will be decisive in winning the war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States gathered military and defense leaders from 40 countries in a meeting in Germany on April 26 to discuss accelerating the supply of weapons and aid to Ukraine. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin stated that a US-led international group like this one will meet monthly to focus on aiding Ukraine and coined it the Ukraine Contact Group. The group will include defense ministers and military chiefs, meeting either virtually or in person.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US State Department approved the sale of $165 million in legacy Warsaw Pact ammunition and other non-standard ammunition to Ukraine on April 25.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Australian officials stated on April 27 that Australia has committed to providing $19 million in military assistance to Ukraine. The assistance includes ammunition, six 155mm howitzers, 20 Bushmaster mobility vehicles, and additional military supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht stated on April 26 that Germany will send 50 self-propelled antiaircraft guns to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated on April 26 that Poland will send an unknown number of tanks to Ukraine after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to backfill Poland’s supplies. Polish media reported on April 30 that Poland has sent over 200 T-72 tanks to Ukraine in the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand stated on April 26 that Canada would send an undetermined number of M777 155-mm howitzers to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The South Korean Foreign Ministry announced on April 29 that South Korea will provide an additional $50 million in non-combat support to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a $375 million security aid package to Ukraine during an address to Ukraine’s Parliament on May 3. The package includes heavy drones, electronic warfare equipment, night vision devices, and 13 upgraded 4x4 armored vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;foreign-involvement&quot;&gt;Foreign Involvement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin’s antisemitism may drive Israel away from its current neutral position on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov bizarrely claimed on May 2 that Hitler, like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, was Jewish, and that “the most ardent antisemites are usually Jews.” Hitler was not Jewish. Israel’s foreign ministry summoned the Russian ambassador on May 2 to condemn Lavrov’s comments. The Russian Foreign Ministry accused Israel on May 3 of supporting the “neo-Nazi” regime in Kyiv. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed on May 4 that Israeli mercenaries are fighting alongside the far-right Azov Battalion in Ukraine and that Israel has long ignored Ukrainian neo-Nazism. The diplomatic spat may put political pressure on Israel to more directly oppose Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Israel has so far attempted to frame itself as a mediator in the conflict. At least one pro-Kremlin media outlet amplified experts who refuted the often-debunked claim that Hitler had Jewish ancestry but justified Lavrov’s claims as well-intentioned, likely in an attempt to mend the Russo-Israeli rift.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ISW Russia Team</name></author><summary type="html">This update covers events from Apr 22 - May 4.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/rbIm25N.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/rbIm25N.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Russia Losing On Electronic</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-05-04-russia-losing-on-electronic.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Russia Losing On Electronic" /><published>2022-05-04T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-05-04T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/russia-losing-on-electronic</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-05-04-russia-losing-on-electronic.html">&lt;p&gt;Among Russia’s most costly mistakes when it invaded Ukraine was the expectation that it would dominate the electronic warfare part of the battle. Instead, Russia has stumbled and lost its way in the little-known realm of intercepting and jamming communications, an increasingly essential element of military success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s unexpected failure on the electronic battlefield offers a case study in what has gone wrong for Moscow since the invasion began Feb. 24. The Russians overestimated their own capabilities, underestimated Ukraine’s – and didn’t reckon on the power of NATO military support for Kyiv. These failures left Russia’s forces – and even some of its top generals – vulnerable to attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was a combination of Russian arrogance and Ukrainian ingenuity,” retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges argues, explaining Moscow’s reversals on this front. Hodges commanded U.S. Army troops in Europe from 2014 to 2018 and has emerged as one of the most knowledgeable commentators on the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic warfare, or “EW,” is one of the exotic military arts that can be decisive on the modern battlefield but is almost unknown to the general public. The aim is to attack an adversary by manipulating the electromagnetic spectrum – through jamming, intercepting or altering communications, radar, GPS or other signals. This is the 21st-century version of what one of Britain’s chief scientists during World War Two described as the “wizard war.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s vulnerability was vividly demonstrated this past weekend when it was reported that Maj. Gen. Andrei Simonov, among his country’s leading electronic war specialists, was killed in a Ukrainian artillery strike on a command post near Izyum. The fact that Ukraine could strike such a sensitive position illustrates its surprising mastery of precision targeting and attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has tapped into Russian communications, blocked its signals, blinded its surveillance, and captured some its most advanced EW systems, experts say. The United States and its NATO partners have provided crucial EW equipment and training. But American experts say it’s the Ukrainians themselves who adapted these high-tech weapons to protect their homeland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s success has been remarkable in part because of the widespread initial expectation among U.S. and NATO commanders that Russia would dominate the electromagnetic battlespace in this war. Russia had built systems that could, in theory, create an electronic bubble around its forces, effectively blinding adversaries. U.S. commanders feared that Ukrainian units would be isolated and unable to communicate in this electronic fog of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyiv rebuilt its capabilities after it suffered bitter setbacks during Russia’s 2014 and 2015 attacks on eastern Ukraine. Russian EW success back then was dazzling, and some senior Pentagon officials feared it would be repeated this year. But as Russian commanders prepared for the 2022 invasion, they made two blunders: They assumed that the Ukrainian military had not advanced significantly since 2015, and they ignored the impact of equipment and training provided by NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States after 2015 began supplying Ukraine with secure L3Harris radios that couldn’t easily be jammed, unlike the old Soviet-era equipment that Ukraine had been using. There’s an interesting footnote here: L3Harris radios were among the military equipment that President Donald Trump withheld from Ukraine while he was trying to obtain political favors from President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2019, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/this-isnt-just-another-spat-trump-compromised-our-security-for-his-gain/2019/09/24/b3eb24ae-df09-11e9-be96-6adb81821e90_story.html&quot;&gt;I reported at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainians learned to use these modern tools of war at a training base – known as the Joint Multinational Training Group-Ukraine – that was established in 2015 by the United States and some NATO partners at the Yavoriv Combat Training Center in western Ukraine, near Lviv. Hodges said that U.S. commanders learned so much from watching the Ukrainians prepare to fight in an EW-contested battlespace that they revised the U.S. Army’s own training practices in exercises in Hohenfels, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian way of war on the electronic battlefield suffers from some of the same limitations that have hindered Russian forces generally, U.S. military experts say. The Russian systems are big and best suited to static positions, rather the multipronged mobile offensive that Russia launched in February. Russian systems operated well in the tight battle zone of Donbas in 2014, and they may repeat that success in the new Donbas campaign that began last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s centralized, top-down command structure also hindered its EW forces in making quick adaptations; there weren’t any Russian noncommissioned officers who could make speedy fixes. And because the Russians lacked total air supremacy over Ukraine, their EW planes often remained in safe territory in Russia and Belarus – which limited signals collection and jamming capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When their fancy communications equipment broke down, the Russians resorted to cellphones on Ukrainian networks, which revealed not just their plans but their locations – allowing precise attacks. Another setback was Ukraine’s capture of some of Russia’s most sensitive EW equipment, including part of an advanced Krasukha-4 array, which the Ukrainians quickly tried to re-engineer and turn back against the Russians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the history of the Ukraine war is finally written, the chapter on electronic warfare may be one of the most telling – and one where U.S. assistance was both least visible and most helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian military comfortably outnumbered Ukraine’s, and its military technology was more advanced. Russia’s GDP was nearly ten times the size of the Ukrainian economy, and its population about triple that of its neighbor’s. Many analysts expected that, after being largely conquered, Ukrainians would launch a protracted insurgency that might defeat the Russians over time. But few believed Ukraine could stop the invasion in a conventional war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet Ukraine has held on. Russia’s assault on Kyiv stalled within a month and failed entirely shortly thereafter. Moscow did not topple the Ukrainian government, and its invasion was halted not just around Kyiv but also along the southwestern coast. Russia has withdrawn its battered forces from around the capital and from large swaths of northeastern Ukraine, covering its defeat with claims that it was simply refocusing its efforts to the Donbas. Russian troops have made more progress in this region but only slowly and at the cost of many casualties. The Russian invasion grinds on, but Kyiv and other swaths of Ukraine will be free when it finally ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion has come up short for many reasons. Ukrainian heroism and remarkably intelligent and adaptive fighting techniques are major ones. Russia’s failure to prepare for serious Ukrainian resistance and, therefore, to develop supply systems that could support a prolonged assault on northern Ukraine is another. But none of these factors — alone or together — explain Russia’s stunning failure to achieve its initial objectives. Instead, analysts must consider a problem for Russia that is far more fundamental: its invasion plan itself was shockingly bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful military campaigns usually follow several central principles. Military leaders must choose the most important objective and then assign the right amount and right kind of military forces to ensure its achievement. Rather than trying to do everything at once, they must prioritize and sequence operations to make achieving this objective as easy as possible. And they must design campaigns to make sure that they will bring the combat power necessary to win the war’s last battle and to attain their political objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion plan was shockingly bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia knows these principles well. Indeed, the Soviet Union perfected many of them over the course of decades, and the post-Soviet Russian military inherited and further developed these doctrines to conduct large-scale mechanized warfare. But in Ukraine, it violated every one of them. Russia’s invasion was sweeping and unprioritized rather than sequential and deliberate. It mismatched its forces to tasks and gave Ukraine’s defenders clear ways to fight back. In fact, Russia’s design choice was so poor that the invasion would have likely failed even if the supply arrangements had been sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia may yet win the next phase of the war. Its military leadership seems to be learning from its logistics problems in its new campaign in eastern Ukraine. It can concentrate more forces on a small area. Its overall reserves of manpower and equipment, although surprisingly depleted, remain larger than Ukraine’s. But Russia’s military leadership seems not to have rediscovered how to follow proper campaign design principles, a fact that is already compromising its renewed offensive. It may again lead to failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;EVERYTHING, EVERYWHERE, ALL AT ONCE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial Russian objective was to seize Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities, remove the current Ukrainian government, and impose a new regime beholden to Moscow. Russia’s first and overwhelming objective, then, should have been taking the capital, and a sound campaign plan would have prioritized this aim and subordinated actions elsewhere. The collapse of the Ukrainian government and the destruction of the Ukrainian military forces defending it, after all, would likely have unhinged Ukrainian defenses elsewhere, making the conquest of eastern and southern Ukraine much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not what Russia did. Instead, it also set out to secure the territory of Luhansk and Donetsk regions, known as oblasts, for the Moscow-controlled Luhansk and Donetsk’s “People’s Republics,” and it tried to establish a land bridge connecting the northern Crimean Peninsula with Russia itself. Russia did attack south from Belarus and its own territory toward Kyiv with large forces, but it also sent a large contingent of troops to seize the city of Kharkiv (which is 250 miles to the east), another large force to drive into Luhansk oblast even farther east, still another to seize Mariupol, and a final large concentration to take Kherson, Mykolaiv, and ultimately Odessa — all at the same time. In short, the Russians made the mistake of trying to conquer everything they wanted in Ukraine simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Conquering Kyiv was entrusted to Moscow’s least-trained and worst-equipped mechanized forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces would have attacked in the south and east even in a well-designed campaign, but for a different purpose. Their aim should have been to trap Ukrainian forces in fights in those areas to prevent them from rushing to Kyiv and interfering with the decisive battle. To accomplish that objective, Russia’s initial attacks in the south and east should have used much smaller forces and pursued much more limited territorial objectives than they did in reality; doing so would have allowed the Russian military to concentrate its best troops and the most combat power on the difficult task of seizing the capital. Instead, Russia assigned its premier armored force — the 1st Guards Tank Army, which is optimized for a rapid offensive using tanks and armored personnel carriers — to attack the eastern city of Sumy, about 190 miles from Kyiv. Conquering Kyiv was then entrusted to the troops of the Eastern Military District, the one with the least-trained and worst-equipped mechanized forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia might still have seized Kyiv if it had been able to reinforce the Eastern Military District with good troops. A soundly designed campaign (one consistent with Soviet and Russian military theory and doctrine) would have kept some forces in reserve for precisely such a purpose. But the Russian military committed all its available forces trying to achieve all its objectives simultaneously, leaving no meaningful reserve. When the drive on Kyiv bogged down, the Russians had to cast around whatever reinforcements they could find. They compounded their error by rushing those reinforcements piecemeal into the fight, rather than pausing to cohere effective groupings, fueling tactical failures that led to Russia’s final defeat outside the capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian operations elsewhere in Ukraine replicated these flaws. Southern Military District forces in Crimea attacked at once along three diverging axes — to the west toward Kherson and Mykolaiv, with the intention of continuing on to Odessa; to the east toward Mariupol; and to the north toward Zaporizhzhia. These attacks did not support one another — separate groups of Ukrainian troops defended Kherson and Mykolaiv, Mariupol, and Zaporizhzhia, and so attacks in one direction did not threaten Ukrainian defenders in the others. And splitting Russia’s forces deprived all three axes of the strength they needed to truly achieve their objectives. Russian troops took Kherson relatively quickly, but they failed to take Mykolaiv or find another way toward Odessa. The offensive toward Zaporizhzhia was halted about 40 miles south of the city. Russia eventually seized most of Mariupol, but only at a horrific cost. Had the Southern Military District focused on each campaign sequentially, it might have made much more rapid and significant progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;DESIGNED TO FAIL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having failed in the north and across much of the south, Russia has begun a new phase of the war focused on capturing the east while holding on to the parts of southern Ukraine and the Kharkiv region it has already taken. Moscow has concentrated its remaining forces for attacks along four main axes in the Donbas — from Izyum to the southeast; from the area around Rubizhne to the west; from Popasna to the west; and from Donetsk to the north. The fifth large concentration of Russian forces has just declared victory in Mariupol, although fighting continues. Some of those forces have already begun moving north to join the fight in the western Donbas while others try to finish securing Mariupol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But so far, the apparent design of this campaign appears to share important flaws with Russia’s initial operation. For one thing, it again seeks to achieve all of Russia’s objectives simultaneously: seizing the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, as well as the rest of Mariupol, in a single campaign in the next few weeks. For another, Russia is operating along multiple axes of advance that are not mutually supportive. Separate groups of Ukrainian forces defend against each axis, and the Russian attacks are too far apart for any combination of them to threaten the same Ukrainian troops (at least for now). Finally, the Russians are committing all available forces to the fight from the outset. They do not appear to be retaining mobile reserves to reinforce advances that stall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Russian campaign does have important advantages over the initial invasion. It is occurring in a smaller area, one that allows Russia to fight against a part of Ukraine’s military rather than spreading its forces out against the whole of the Ukrainian armed forces. The four major axes of advance are also roughly along the radius of a semicircle that stretches from Izyum to Donetsk, which means if Russian forces can make enough quick progress, their attacks will become complementary as they converge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it reamins unclear if the Russian military sees these advantages, if it seeks to use them, or if it can. The natural path for Russian forces looking to encircle Ukrainian troops in the pocket around Popasna, Rubizhne, and Severodonetsk would be to advance from Izyum southeast toward Slovyansk, and from the area around Russian-occupied Debaltseve northwest along the same highway to Slovyansk. But although Russian forces around Izyum have been trying to drive toward Slovyansk, they have somewhat oddly begun pushing out to the west, away from the rest of the Russian forces operating in the Donbas rather than toward them. On the southern arc of the semicircle, Russia has thus far not sought to drive northeast from Debaltseve — possibly because of difficult terrain and stubborn Ukrainian defenders — and has instead launched an attack from Donetsk north through Avdiivka. This route is superficially more attractive than routes closer to Debaltseve because it leads through more open countryside. But it is about 30 miles west of the Slovyansk-Debaltseve highway, and it could require Russian forces to cross 50 to 100 miles of Ukrainian defenders without the support of other Russian attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, these errors may not be decisive. Strategy isn’t everything, and the real strength and combat power of Russian forces may matter more than the geometry of planned advances. Conversely, Russia could correct these mistakes in their campaign planning and still fall short: the fact that the Russians are trying to remedy their critical logistical flaws, for example, does not mean they will succeed in doing so. There are plenty of other factors that will also help shape the outcome, including the flow of Western equipment to Ukraine and the ability of the country’s exhausted defenders to keep resisting Russian advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for now, the current Russian campaign plan resembles the initial invasion plan in a microcosm, and it will likely suffer from many similar problems. It suggests that the Russians have truly forgotten everything they and their Soviet predecessors ever knew about how to fight mechanized warfare on a large scale. And it means that, despite being outgunned, the Ukrainians have a real chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia and Ukraine are unlikely to resume negotiations in the coming weeks. Both sides await the outcome of Russia’s ongoing offensive in eastern Ukraine. Kyiv likely assesses that its military has the potential to push Russian forces back to their pre-February 24 positions and is unlikely to engage in negotiations until that outcome occurs or becomes significantly less likely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is increasingly describing the war in Ukraine as a war with NATO to the domestic Russian audience to explain slower-than-intended operations and mounting casualties.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin likely intends to create one or more proxy states in occupied southern Ukraine to cement its military occupation and set conditions to demand permanent control over these regions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian and Belarusian officials seek to frame Western sanctions as predominantly harming European economies while playing up the efficacy of their sanction-mitigation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is failing to deter NATO expansion and failing to disrupt Ukraine’s military alignment with the West.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin remains unlikely to use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine in this phase of the war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-events&quot;&gt;Key Events&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;negotiations&quot;&gt;Negotiations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and Ukraine are unlikely to resume negotiations in the coming weeks. Both sides await the outcome of Russia’s ongoing offensive in eastern Ukraine as they attempt to build leverage for future negotiations. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced that the second phase of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began on April 19 and that its objective is the “complete liberation” of the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, which are claimed by Russia’s proxies in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on April 17 that he “[doesn’t] trust the Russian military and Russian leadership” to not attempt to take Kyiv again if they win the battle for eastern Ukraine and re-emphasized that Ukraine is unwilling to give up its territory to end the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing reports of Russian atrocities are bolstering Ukraine’s political will to fight and make the resumption of higher-level negotiations increasingly unlikely. Zelensky told CNN on April 17 that “there comes a time when no one wants to talk. Our society does not want us to continue negotiations.” Zelensky emphasized the link between Russian atrocities in Bucha, Volnovakha, Borodyanka, and Mariupol and Ukraine’s unwillingness to negotiate. Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said on April 20 that Russian atrocities against Ukrainian civilians make it difficult for Ukraine to approach negotiations “unemotionally.” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba emphasized on April 17 that the “only level of contact” between Russia and Ukraine is the negotiating team made up of parliamentarians and “representatives of various institutions.” Kuleba warned that Mariupol may become a “red line” for Ukraine if Russian forces kill the remaining Ukrainian defenders in the city. Zelensky said the Kremlin rejected a Ukrainian proposal to hold a “special round of negotiations” with Russia to arrange the evacuation of remaining civilians and defenders from Mariupol on April 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin claims that Ukraine is sabotaging the peace negotiations, likely to justify Russia’s continuing invasion to its domestic population. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on April 18 that “unfortunately, the Ukrainian side is not demonstrating much consistency on agreed-upon issues. Their position is changing frequently.” Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on April 20 that “there is no trust” in the negotiations, which she described as an inconsistent “circus.” Zakharova implied that the West is controlling the Ukrainian government and that Kyiv cannot negotiate on its own behalf. She also described negotiations as a “diversionary maneuver” by Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;kremlin-narratives&quot;&gt;Kremlin Narratives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin continued to reframe its invasion of Ukraine as a war of Western aggression against Russia to justify its ongoing invasion — and mounting casualties — to the Russian domestic audience. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed on April 20 that the United States and NATO are “handling processes” in Ukraine and that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “cannot be viewed as an independent politician.” Zakharova claimed on April 19 that the United States has been preparing to “incite” aggression in eastern Ukraine for eight years. Russian State Duma Committee on International Affairs Chairman Leonid Slutsky accused the United States and the United Kingdom of using Ukraine as a “springboard” to justify further confrontation with Russia on April 17. Russian Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin falsely claimed on April 15 that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confessed to intentionally setting conditions to start a war with Russia by purchasing arms and attempting to join NATO prior to Russia’s invasion, reiterating the longstanding Kremlin claim that all Ukrainian arms purchases are inherently offensive toward Russia. Zakharova claimed on April 20 that NATO trained foreign and Ukrainian “neo-Nazis” to use civilians as human shields and to torture prisoners with suspected pro-Russian sympathies. Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev framed foreign volunteers in Ukraine as Western Nazi mercenaries fighting for money on April 19 and warned that they too would be subject to “denazification” when captured. The Investigative Committee of Russia claimed that Western states had armed and prepared Ukrainian forces for war with Russia on April 20. The Kremlin likely seeks to more easily explain Russian military losses to the Russian population by downplaying Ukrainian autonomy and framing the war as being conducted against NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin continues to falsely blame Ukrainian forces for planning or conducting “provocations” in areas where Russian forces intend to commit or have already committed atrocities. The Kremlin likely seeks to introduce doubt into future attributions of war crimes and to diminish global support for Ukraine by blaming Ukrainian forces for crimes already committed by Russian forces. The Kremlin likely also intends to negatively portray Ukrainian forces to the Russian population to maintain domestic support for the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Russian officials claimed on April 15 that Ukrainian forces regularly use civilians as human shields and that Ukrainian forces plan to carry out an attack on the Lozova train station in Kharkiv Oblast to provoke retaliation from Russia. Russian forces conducted a missile attack on a refugee-filled train station in Kramatorsk and blamed Ukrainian forces on April 8.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Russian proxy Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) claimed on April 15 that Ukrainian special forces intended to stage a terror attack on an April 16 rally in the city of Luhansk. LNR officials claimed that Ukrainian forces organized the rally. No such attack took place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s Ministry of Defense claimed on April 19 that Ukrainian forces were planning several independent attacks on civilians across Ukraine including shooting civilians that surrender in Mariupol; shelling civilians in Zaporizhia, Odesa, Sumy, and Kharkiv Oblasts; and executing Russian civilians in Odesa. Such false claims indicate that Russian forces may have killed civilians in some named areas and intend to blame Ukraine for their deaths. No fighting has taken place in Odesa since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24; the Kremlin likely intends claims regarding Odesa to further Kremlin claims of a Ukrainian genocide against Russians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian First Deputy Representative to the United Nations Dmitry Polyansky claimed that Russian forces did not know there were civilians in the Azovstal steel plant prior to April 18 and argued that “radicals and Neo-Nazis” placed civilians in the plant to be used as human shields on April 19.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed on April 20 that Ukrainian “neo-Nazis” have been using schools in Kherson as headquarters since February 24. The Kremlin will likely amplify any reports of Ukrainian forces operating near civilian infrastructure to justify Russian targeting of Ukrainian civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LNR claimed on April 20 and 21 that Ukrainian nationalists are planning to attack churches with Tochka-U missiles along the frontlines near Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporizhia, and Kharkiv on April 24, Orthodox Easter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ukraine’s Odesa Regional Military Administration Spokesperson Sergei Bratchuk claimed on April 18 that Russian forces are planning to strike at Kherson with multiple rocket launchers as part of a false flag operation to justify an upcoming Russian “referendum” to create a Kherson People’s Republic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin remains unlikely to use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine during this phase of the war. The Kremlin likely assesses that the use of a nuclear weapon would trigger greater NATO involvement in the war, making the Russian use of a nuclear weapon a net loss for Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov denied that Russia would use nuclear weapons in Ukraine and claimed that Russia is only considering using conventional weapons in statements on April 19 that Kremlin-run media outlets subsequently heavily promoted. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on April 20 that Russian law enforcement should investigate anyone who spreads disinformation about Russia considering the use of nuclear weapons and reiterated Lavrov’s statement that Russia will only use conventional weapons in Ukraine. State-run media outlets circulating her statement emphasized Russia’s signatory status on nuclear control treaties. Two US officials “familiar with recent intelligence assessments” told CNN on April 20 that the United States has not seen any indicators of Russian preparations to use nuclear weapons. The United States and its allies would almost certainly publicly warn of any indicators that the Kremlin was preparing to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. The Kremlin likely seeks to avoid such a massive escalation that would likely lead to direct NATO involvement and instead seeks to frame itself as nonaggressive. The Kremlin will likely rely on conventional and possibly chemical weapons capabilities to achieve its objectives in Donbas. While we cannot completely rule out the Russian use of a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, the Kremlin is highly unlikely to use one during this phase of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-domestic-opposition-and-censorship&quot;&gt;Russian Domestic Opposition and Censorship&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kremlin censorship of Russian and international media seeks to maintain its narrative that Russian forces are only targeting Ukrainian military personnel and key strategic infrastructure, not Ukrainian civilians. Russian state censorship body Roskomnadzor further restricted access to independent publications and international coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the past week. Roskomnadzor is particularly targeting international reports of Russian war crimes, as such reporting could undermine the Kremlin’s false framing that Ukraine is responsible for all civilian deaths in Ukraine. The Kremlin has likely ordered intimidation tactics to be used against opposition journalists, activists, and concerned citizens within Russia to deter any realistic coverage of the Russian invasion. The Russian Ministry of Defense classified information on the relatives of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine on April 20 (which was previously available through civilian institutions due to the families of deceased personnel receiving state benefits), citing security risks. Limiting the publication of such data will enable the Kremlin to disguise the full scope of Russian losses from the Russian public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-reactions-to-sanctions&quot;&gt;Russian Reactions to Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian and Belarusian officials seek to frame Western sanctions as predominantly harming European economies while playing up the efficacy of their sanctions mitigation efforts. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on April 18 that the “economic blitzkrieg” of Western sanctions failed to destabilize the Russian economy. Putin additionally claimed that anti-Russian sanctions have caused a decline in the standard of living throughout Europe. Russian Security Council Deputy Head Dmitry Medvedev claimed on April 16 that Western sanctions against Russia could cause hyperinflation in Europe and an influx of Ukrainian refugees would cause a “crime wave.” European Commission Head Ursula von der Leyen stated on April 17 that the Russian state’s bankruptcy is only “a matter of time.” Both Russia and Belarus continued to frame sanctions as opportunities for their economies. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin asserted on April 16 that sanctions provide a “window of opportunity” for Russia’s youth to “rebuild and find new ways of development.” Belarusian Prime Minister Roman Golovchenko stated on April 16 that Belarus has taken “systemic” measures to reduce inflation including introducing state-regulated prices for non-food items for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-occupation&quot;&gt;Russian Occupation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin likely intends to create one or more proxy states in occupied southern Ukraine to cement its military occupation and set conditions to demand permanent control over these regions. Russian proxy Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) head Denis Pushilin claimed on April 20 that residents of the Russian-occupied Rozovsky district in Ukraine’s Zaporizhia Oblast independently convened a meeting and voted unanimously to join the DNR. Residents were likely forced to hold such a meeting; ISW could not confirm the location or participants in videos of the meeting. Ukrainian military sources reported on April 21 that Russian forces are preparing to conduct a “referendum” to create a “Kherson People’s Republic” on April 27. The Kremlin will likely conduct additional “referendums” in occupied parts of eastern Ukraine to set conditions to annex more of the country, either into Russia or into its preexisting proxies. The Kremlin will likely use such faux republics to appoint Russian proxy leadership and will use those structures to forcibly mobilize or otherwise exploit local populations. Ukrainian intelligence claimed on April 20 that the Kremlin is planning to forcibly mobilize Ukrainian men from both Kherson and Zaporizhia oblasts to fight for Russia. Russia has already begun to create a heavily pro-Russia information environment in occupied parts of Ukraine, limiting Ukrainian media in favor of Russian outlets and broadcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin may be recruiting additional mercenaries to fight in eastern Ukraine and reportedly already has as many as 20,000 mercenaries (both Russian and international) in eastern Ukraine. An anonymous European official told The Kyiv Post on April 19 that Russia has between 10,000 and 20,000 mercenaries from Syria, Libya, and the Russian private military company Wagner Group fighting on its behalf in eastern Ukraine. The official said that the mercenaries are predominantly infantry. The majority of these mercenaries are likely Russian, and the Ukrainian government reported that at most several hundred Libyan mercenaries are engaged in fighting around Popasna in eastern Ukraine. Meanwhile, hundreds of Ethiopians queued in front of the Russian Embassy in Addis Ababa on April 19. The Russian Embassy denied allegations, circulated by Ukrainian outlets, that it was recruiting Ethiopian mercenaries to fight in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drivers-of-russian-threat-perceptions&quot;&gt;Drivers of Russian Threat Perceptions:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is failing to deter NATO expansion and failing to disrupt Ukraine’s military alignment with the West. Russian Ambassador-at-Large and Chairman of the Committee of Senior Officials of the Arctic Council Nikolai Korchunov warned Sweden and Finland against joining NATO on April 17 and claimed that the expansion of NATO would be to the detriment of “traditionally non-aligned blocs” by leading to mutual distrust. Finland’s parliament debated its accession to NATO on April 20 and will likely ask to join the alliance in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, US and Western military support continued to reach Ukraine’s armed forces to bolster their operations in Donbas, demonstrating the continued efficacy of the pro-Ukraine coalition. Russia issued a diplomatic demarche after US President Joe Biden announced an $800 million security package on April 14, claiming that US and NATO weapons shipments to Ukraine were worsening the war and would bring about “unpredictable consequences.” The US security package arrived in Ukraine on April 18. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said that the aid package included aircraft parts that will enable the recommissioning of about 20 Ukrainian aircraft. The United States announced a second $800 million security package on April 21 that includes 72 howitzers with accompanying vehicles and 440,000 rounds of ammunition; over 121 Phoenix Ghost Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems tailored to Ukraine’s needs; and various field equipment and spare parts. A senior US defense official told Reuters on April 20 that the United States has resumed training small numbers of Ukrainians on the use of the new artillery. The weeklong trainings will take place outside Ukraine, likely in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European states also promised additional aid:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finland announced on April 21 that it will send unspecified additional defense material to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock announced that Germany would provide artillery training and maintenance to Ukraine on April 20. She added that Germany had delivered anti-tank weapons, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, and “other things that [they] didn’t talk about in public.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederikson announced Denmark will more than double its current military aid to Ukraine during her April 21 trip to Ukraine. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced that Spain will send 200 tons of ammunition and other military supplies during the same trip.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA has limited experience with urban warfare and so often relies on observations of other militaries to inform its outlook. Among the drivers for this interest in urban warfare is that any Chinese campaign to force “(re)unification” with Taiwan could involve intense fighting in Taiwanese cities. The current edition of the Science of Military Strategy mentions an urban offensive (城市进攻) as a component of island operations (岛上作战) but does not elaborate on the conduct of such an offensive, likely because of the sensitivity of this scenario. This campaign could present a particular challenge, given that over 90 percent of Taiwan’s population lives in cities. Beyond the possibility of invading Taiwan, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is also concerned about terrorist threats, whether real and imagined, within China’s cities or against the security of Chinese citizens and businesses worldwide. Meanwhile, the conduct of urban counterterrorism has become the focus of several exercises and exchanges undertaken by the PLA and the People’s Armed Police (PAP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA’s outlook on urban warfare has informed its efforts to introduce new tactics, training, and weapons systems. The continuation or potential acceleration of efforts on these fronts could be critical indicators of its progress toward fulfilling CCP objectives in military modernization, including those targeted against Taiwan. While attacks on cities have been difficult throughout history, modern urban warfare has proven uniquely challenging for even the most powerful militaries. Such operations can be costly, lengthy, and bloody while negatively impacting morale at home and prestige abroad. Chinese military discourse often describes urban warfare as “battling rats in a china shop” (在瓷器店中打老鼠). The complex environment alows adversary combatants to hide among civilians and creates high risks for collateral damage. Fighting in urban terrain inherently benefits defenders or insurgents who operate asymmetrically or can exploit an opponent’s aversion to causing collateral damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the past decade, the PLA has constructed specialized training facilities to simulate operations in urban environments and undertaken exercises that have contributed to establishing baseline proficiency in this style of combat. If China were to invade Taiwan, beyond the initial amphibious operations, the PLA would be confronted with considerable challenges, including considerations of public opinion and international legitimization. The success of such a campaign could depend upon the PLA’s capacity not only to counter potential American intervention but also to seize effective control across Taiwan quickly enough to enable a fait accompli that would be difficult to reverse. To that end, the PLA’s training exercises in urban warfare, especially by the Eastern Theater Command (ETC), have aimed to enhance the credibility of such capabilities while also advancing aims of coercive signaling. The PLA’s capacity to engage effectively in urban warfare at scale is an important benchmark for evaluating its prospects of using force to realize control of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urban battlefields have often featured new technologies and necessitated the development of novel capacities. The growing prevalence in urban combat of unmanned aerial and ground systems — drones — is a recent example of that trend. These systems can improve intelligence support at the tactical level, lessen the risks faced by troops, and facilitate the targeting of other weapon systems. The PLA’s avid interest in drones that could become more “intelligent” and autonomous in their operations reflects its belief that US, Russian, and Israeli military operations have already proven the efficacy of drones in urban combat. The complexity of the urban environment means that the PLA’s preparations for urban warfare will test the utility and reliability of its drone capabilities, as well as its other advanced technologies, and serve as a benchmark for the PLA’s progress toward “military intelligentization” (智能化).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report explores the PLA’s history with urban warfare and considers several lessons from the PLA’s study of other militaries’ operations. Our analysis examines the PLA’s outlook on new technologies and emerging capabilities for future urban warfare, discusses several relevant weapon systems and capabilities that the PLA is pursuing, and evaluates the training and recent exercises through which the PLA is seeking to improve its proficiency in urban warfare. This report concludes by raising questions for future research and includes several recommendations and considerations for US and Taiwanese policy responses. The US military can look to leverage lessons learned  from its conflicts over the past twenty years and explore options to contribute to Taiwan’s capabilities for robust defense and resistance within its cities. The PLA’s progress in preparing for urban warfare will merit continued analytic attention; an improved understanding of these dynamics could inform US and Taiwanese initiatives to bolster deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine and Russia are both unlikely to advance ceasefire negotiations until the ongoing Russian campaign in eastern Ukraine develops further. The Kremlin likely seeks to capture at minimum the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, while Kyiv seeks to further degrade the Russian military and potentially conduct major counteroffensives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin may be purging elements of his intelligence service and blaming close allies for Russian intelligence and planning failures in the lead-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is likely falsely blaming Ukrainian forces for planning or conducting provocations in areas where Russian forces intend to commit or have already committed atrocities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Independent actors are unlikely to be able to verify Ukraine’s April 11 claim that Russian forces used chemical weapons in Mariupol, but Russian forces retain the capability to use chemical weapons beyond this specific instance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is reframing the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a Western war against Russia in a likely effort to maintain Russian domestic acceptance of the war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Belarus and Russia are increasing economic ties — and likely Kremlin influence over Belarus — as sanctions cut off both states from international markets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finland and Sweden are increasingly reconsidering their non-aligned status and may move to join NATO in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Western countries continued to search for alternatives to Russian energy while the Kremlin tried to downplay the effects of Western sanctions on its economy and energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NATO countries continue to secure their eastern borders and provide military assistance (including several high-end capabilities) to Ukraine to counter Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-events&quot;&gt;Key Events&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;negotiations&quot;&gt;Negotiations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ceasefire negotiations have effectively collapsed. Both Russian and Ukrainian officials are unprepared to engage in serious negotiations in the coming weeks in any format. Virtual negotiations are continuing without progress. Kyiv and Moscow are both likely counting on the outcome of Russia’s offensive in eastern Ukraine to recalibrate their negotiating positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyiv is unlikely to accept a peace deal without Russian forces withdrawing to at minimum their pre-February 24 positions and likely hopes to further degrade the Russian military in eastern Ukraine and possibly retake Russian-occupied territory before reengaging with the Kremlin. Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak stated on April 9 that Ukraine is prepared to pay a high price for victory and that Ukrainian military victories in the east will provide substantial leverage to negotiate “powerful” security guarantees with the Kremlin. Podolyak and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky separately emphasized on April 11 that Ukraine is not prepared “to give up territory for peace.” Ukrainian anger over Russian atrocities against Ukrainian civilians will additionally likely entrench Ukraine’s unwillingness to negotiate with the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin will likely stall negotiations until Russian forces redeploy from other axes to eastern Ukraine, hoping to translate any Russian military gains into leverage over Ukrainian negotiators. Putin said on April 12 that negotiations have reached an impasse. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on April 8 that Russia could complete its invasion of Ukraine in the “foreseeable future.” Russian forces will likely continue ongoing offensive operations in the Donbas region, feeding reinforcements into the fight as they become available rather than gathering reinforcements and replacements for a more coordinated and coherent offensive. The Kremlin likely hopes to capture at minimum the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts before resuming negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A direct meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents remains unlikely in the coming weeks. Peskov said on April 14 that Putin is not opposed to meeting with Zelensky, but that negotiators must first agree to the text of an agreement, effectively postponing further negotiations and limiting the possibility of direct negotiations between Putin and Zelensky. Ukrainian Presidential advisor Podolyak said on April 13 that only a direct meeting between Zelensky and Putin can end the war, but that Ukraine must first prove itself economically and on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;kremlin-narratives&quot;&gt;Kremlin Narratives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its partners will likely be unable to verify Ukrainian claims of Russian use of chemical weapons in Mariupol, a location the Kremlin may have intentionally chosen due to international observers’ lack of access to the area. The Ukrainian Azov Regiment claimed in a Telegram post that a Russian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) dropped a “poisonous substance of unknown origin” on Ukrainian defenders in Mariupol’s Azovstal steel plant. Mariupol Deputy Mayor Sergei Orlov confirmed a “chemical poisoning” on April 12, citing military forces. Ukrainian Donetsk Regional Military Governor Pavel Kirilenko confirmed on April 12 that Russian forces dropped an unknown substance from a drone but said it was too early to identify whether the substance could be classified as a chemical weapon. The inability to verify the attack introduces doubt into the Ukrainian narrative and sets the stage to dismiss future Ukrainian reports of Russian chemical attacks. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the United States and Ukraine are not in a position to confirm the Russian deployment of chemical weapons in Mariupol due to challenges in verifying the attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Kremlin has previously set informational conditions to blame Ukrainian forces for Russian-conducted attacks in eastern Ukraine and retains the capability to conduct chemical warfare. The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed it had “reliable data” on April 7 that Ukraine was planning a chemical provocation against Russia and has repeatedly and falsely accused Ukraine of developing chemical and biochemical weapons in alleged US-funded biolabs throughout the country. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed on April 10 that Ukrainian “Neo-Nazis” were preparing a chemical “provocation” at the Avdiivka Coke and Chemical Plant in Donetsk Oblast, stating they planned to blow up toxic chemical storage facilities when DNR forces approached the plant. The alleged April 11 Russian chemical attack targeted a different coke and chemical plant in Donetsk. These pre-emptive claims are part of the standard Kremlin playbook for chemical weapons usage in Syria: Kremlin-linked media outlets first claim that opposition forces are planning a chemical weapons attack in a given region, then attack the area themselves, allegedly proving their narrative. Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) Defense Spokesperson Eduard Basurin called for Russian forces to use chemical weapons against Ukrainian troops in the Azovstal area of Mariupol, Donetsk Oblast, mere hours before the reported attack. While we cannot confirm this specific claim of a Russian chemical attack, Russian forces retain the capability and possible intent to use chemical weapons in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is likely falsely blaming Ukrainian forces for planning or conducting provocations in areas where Russian forces intend to commit or have already committed atrocities. The Kremlin likely seeks to introduce doubt into future attributions of war crimes and to diminish global support for Ukraine by blaming Ukrainian forces for crimes already committed by Russian forces. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry reported on April 13 that the Kremlin ordered Russian forces use mobile crematoriums to destroy evidence of civilian deaths, and Russian forces will likely take additional measures moving forward to hide evidence of their violence against civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian media amplified statements on April 9 by a biological weapons “expert” that Ukrainian forces blew up a nitric acid tank in Rubizhne, Donestk Oblast. These claims follow two Russian strikes that ignited nitric acid tanks at a chemical plant in Rubizhne on April 5 and April 9.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DNR Head Denis Pushilin claimed on April 9 that Ukrainian forces are preparing a “series of massive attacks on the cities of Donbas” to blame civilian deaths on Russian troops. Russian forces are redeploying en masse for a larger-scale offensive in Donbas that will likely lead to civilian deaths. The Kremlin is likely attempting to preempt blame for those civilian deaths to avoid the international backlash that occurred after Russian forces withdrew from the Kyiv region, leaving behind evidence of atrocities against civilians in Bucha. Putin said on April 12 that Ukrainians “are being used against Russia” and that the “Bucha tragedy is a fake” and a British special operation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed on April 10 that Ukrainian servicemembers “are preparing another provocation to accuse Russia of the alleged massacres of civilians in Irpin, a suburb of Kyiv.” Tass claimed that Ukrainian forces intend to use bodies killed by Ukrainian shelling to stage alleged Russian war crimes in Irpin. This claim likely does not indicate planned future attacks; Russian forces withdrew from the Kyiv axis in late March and early April. Instead, the Kremlin likely intends this claim to reinforce its narrative that Ukrainian forces staged the Bucha massacre.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian news outlet Pravda amplified claims on April 11 that Ukrainian forces were ordered to execute civilians in Rubizhne, where heavy fighting has taken place. That false claim indicates that Russian forces may be killing civilians in Rubizhne and intend to blame any civilian deaths on Ukrainian defenders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kremlin Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Maria Zakharova warned on April 13 about the plans of Ukrainian authorities to organize a provocation in Sumy, from which Russian forces were withdrawing as of April 14. This claim indicates that Ukrainian forces retaking Sumy may uncover additional evidence of Russian atrocities against civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Oleg Syromolotov claimed on April 13 that Ukrainian forces are “plotting” additional chemical weapons attacks in Donbas and said that the Kremlin could not rule out the “repetition” of attacks on locations containing toxic substances, a reference to the nitric acid tanks in Rubizhne. This claim indicates that the Kremlin may conduct additional chemical weapons attacks in eastern Ukraine and will likely continue to target dangerous areas, including chemical plants.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin falsely framed the April 8 Russian strike on Ukraine’s Kramatorsk train station as a Ukrainian provocation to deflect responsibility and justify Russia’s “special operation” in Ukraine. Pro-Kremlin media initially claimed on April 8 that Russian forces targeted Ukrainian forces and their equipment at the Kramatorsk station but retracted these statements after Ukrainian officials reported over 50 civilian casualties. Russian state media outlet Tass later reported on April 8 that the Kremlin believes that the Ukrainian “provocation” justifies Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin continued to set conditions for additional chemical, biochemical, or radiological false-flag attacks against Ukraine for which it would blame Ukrainian forces and the West. The Kremlin has emphasized this long-running narrative since December 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian Deputy Security Council Head Dmitry Medvedev reiterated on April 12 that the United States is funding biolabs and developing biological weapons in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Oleg Syromolotov said on April 13 that the Kremlin “could not rule out a scenario” in which nuclear material was brought to Ukraine from other countries. Syromolotov did not specify who would bring such material, to what type of material he was referring, or for what such material might be used. ISW previously assessed that the Kremlin could conduct a radiological false flag attack in Ukraine. The Kremlin has repeatedly and falsely claimed that Ukraine was seeking a nuclear weapon to justify Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chief of the Russian Military Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defense Forces Igor Kirillov expressed concern over alleged US bioweapons research on April 14.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kirillov announced on April 14 that the Russian Ministry of Defense had uncovered the names of US and European officials in charge of the alleged US bioweapons program in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kirillov reiterated his claim on April 14 that Ukrainian forces purchased 50 drones that can spray toxic chemicals to conduct chemical and biochemical attacks, likely to reinforce the Kremlin narrative that the reported chemical weapons attack in Mariupol was a Ukrainian false flag and to deflect blame for any future Russian chemical weapons attacks in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is reframing the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a Western war against Russia in a likely effort to maintain Russian domestic acceptance of the war. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that the purpose of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is to end the “reckless” US expansion towards global dominance on April 11, diverging from the Kremlin’s typical narrative that it invaded Ukraine to “denazify” the government. Lavrov claimed that the United States and the European Union used the Russian military operation in Ukraine as a pretext for unprecedented aggression against Russia in order to subordinate Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin echoed Lavrov’s claims on April 12, stating that the United States is fighting Russia for world domination via Ukrainian proxies in a conflict ”more complex than the Cold War.” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov warned that Russia will treat any US or NATO military shipments to Ukraine as legitimate military targets on April 13, threatening potential military escalation against the West. Kremlin efforts to rhetorically frame the war in Ukraine as a struggle with the United States and its allies are unlikely to deter ongoing Western support for Ukraine. The Kremlin instead likely intends to maintain Russian domestic acceptance of the war in Ukraine amid mounting casualties and economic costs by framing the unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine as a defensive war with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-domestic-opposition-and-censorship&quot;&gt;Russian Domestic Opposition and Censorship&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian and Russian-controlled regions bordering Ukraine declared yellow (high) levels of terrorist alerts on April 11, likely to facilitate the transfer of Russian forces through civilian areas toward eastern Ukraine. Governors in Krasnodar, Belgorod, and Voronezh oblasts, as well as Crimea, declared an increased terrorist threat level in some districts on April 11. The Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff assessed on April 13 that Russia likely ordered these measures to facilitate troop movements through Russian border areas into Ukraine. The Kremlin may also seek to play up the threat that Ukrainian forces may pose to Russian territory to maintain Russian domestic support for the Russian invasion. Russia’s interior ministry claimed on April 14 to be taking comprehensive measures in response to alleged bomb threats from Ukrainian territory. Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov threatened to target decision-making centers in Kyiv in retaliation for alleged Ukrainian “attempts of sabotage and strikes” within Russian territory. Russian officials alleged that Ukrainian forces fired mortars into and conducted airstrikes on the Russian region of Bryansk on April 13 and 14. ISW could not independently confirm these reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin may be purging elements of his intelligence service and blaming close allies for Russian intelligence and planning failures in the lead-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov reported on April 12 that Russian authorities transferred Colonel-General Sergei Beseda, a senior official in Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and the head of the Fifth Service, from house arrest to the notorious Lefortovo Prison. Beseda was reportedly placed under house arrest before March 19 due to the early failures in Russia’s invasion. His Fifth Service is the de-facto foreign intelligence arm of the FSB and the branch responsible for political subversion in Russia’s near abroad, including Ukraine. Anonymous sources told the Moscow Times that the Kremlin is questioning Beseda for his failure to create a viable pro-Kremlin opposition in Ukraine to aid Russia in its invasion. Bellingcat reported on April 11 that the FSB also fired or arrested around 150 officers from the Fifth Service over intelligence failures in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Russian parliamentarian Ilya Ponomarev claimed on April 11 that Russian military sources told him that longtime Putin ally Vladislav Surkov is under house arrest in Moscow. The arrests of Surkov and Beseda, as well as the FSB purges, indicate that Putin is increasingly skeptical of the advice that led to Russia’s failures in Ukraine. However, purging longtime intelligence officials with Ukraine expertise may harm the Kremlin’s ability to monitor Ukrainian leadership and to make informed military decisions. Such purges could also harm morale in the rest of the FSB, leading to generally worsened intelligence provisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is attempting to deter the expression of anti-war sentiments among politicians and the Russian public. Russian authorities detained opposition politician and founding member of the Russian Anti-War committee Vladimir Kara-Murza on April 11, likely to intimidate opposition activists. Russian courts on April 12 sentenced four former editors of the student publication Doxa to two years each of hard labor for involving minors in anti-government protests. The four had been detained in April 2021; the Kremlin likely ordered harsher court sentences against protest organizers to be delivered now to deter additional anti-war protests or dissent surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-reactions-to-sanctions&quot;&gt;Russian Reactions to Sanctions:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian officials seek to claim that Western sanctions, not Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, are undermining international institutions even as Russia selectively defaulted on its debts. Russian Security Council Deputy Head Dmitry Medvedev stated on April 8 that sanctions against Russia could “cause further collapse of all international institutions” and may result in “a destroyed world order and severe consequences for the global economy.” Medvedev warned that anti-Russia sanctions qualify as acts of aggression and that Russia has the right to “self-defense.” The Duma began deliberating a new bill on April 7 that would punish entities inside Russia that comply with Western sanctions with a 10-year prison sentence, up to 5 years of forced labor, or a 1 million ruble fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions are continuing to damage Russia’s already-fragile economy. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated on April 7 that Russia began preparing for current sanctions a year ago and asserted that Russia is “safe from the point of view of the economy and macro stability.” The S&amp;amp;P announced on April 8 that Russia fell into selective debt default after Russia offered its required payment in rubles, not dollars, on April 4. The S&amp;amp;P said that ruble payments were insufficient because debt holders could not easily transfer rubles into other denominations. The S&amp;amp;P also stated on April 8 that Russia has a 30-day grace period to pay its debt in dollars. Western sanctions will impede Russia’s ability to access $315 billion of its foreign currency reserves. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov claimed on April 8 that Russia “will sue” and rejected the legitimacy of Russia’s debt default, asserting that Russia “took all the necessary actions to ensure that investors received their payments.” Russia’s Permanent Representative to the UN Gennady Gatilov framed India and China on April 8 as partners for Russia when claiming that Russia “intends to counteract the diplomatic war” with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;belarus&quot;&gt;Belarus:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belarus and Russia are increasing economic ties — and likely Kremlin influence over Belarus — as sanctions cut both states off from international markets. Belarusian state media outlet Belta claimed on April 12 that the US “has declared a full-scale war” on the Union State. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated on April 13 that there are “new windows of opportunity” for Russia and Belarus as Western sanctions impact the Union State market. Russian President Vladimir Putin called Belarusians and Russians “brothers” on April 12 and emphasized the need to deepen Russian-Belarusian integration “against the backdrop of Western sanctions.” Lukashenko stated on April 8 that Belarus will support Russia “in the case of any difficulties” and specifically mentioned that Belarus can increase fuel supplies to Russia. Lukashenko also pointed to the EU energy and agricultural markets when stating on April 7 that sanctions “make the states that impose them weaker.” Putin and Lukashenko also agreed on a project for a common electrical power market, additional joint military exercises, favorable prices for oil and gas for Belarusian domestic consumption with payments in rubles, and the joint construction of a nuclear power plant to be commissioned by the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-occupation&quot;&gt;Russian Occupation:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrest of Viktor Medvedchuk, Russia’s key political proxy in Ukraine, will likely provide a morale boost to Ukrainian forces and a political boost to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukrainian forces captured “Putin’s man in Ukraine,” pro-Kremlin Ukrainian Member of Parliament Viktor Medvedchuk, on April 12 following his escape from house arrest in February. The Kremlin may have intended to appoint Medvedchuk as the head of a Russian proxy regime in Kyiv after Russian forces overthrew the Ukrainian government early in the invasion. Zelensky said on April 12 that Ukrainian forces captured Medvedchuk disguised as a Ukrainian soldier during an attempt to flee Ukraine. Zelensky said Medvedchuk wearing a military uniform places him under the laws of war and offered to trade Medvedchuk for Ukrainian POWs. The Kremlin responded that Medvedchuk is not a Russian citizen in a likely attempt to downplay the political importance of his arrest. First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Konstantin Zatulin criticized Ukrainian officials on April 13 as “engaged in the trade of their own citizens” for offering to exchange Medvedchuk for captured Ukrainian soldiers. Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov falsely claimed on April 13 that Medvedchuk had never had a ”behind the scenes” relationship with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drivers-of-russian-threat-perceptions&quot;&gt;Drivers of Russian Threat Perceptions:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland and Sweden are increasingly reconsidering their non-aligned status and may move to join NATO in the coming months. European Union members Finland and Sweden held a joint press conference in Stockholm, Sweden, on April 13 to discuss how evolving security concerns have led them to explore the possibility of joining NATO. The Finnish government released a white paper on April 13 that outlines the security concerns Finland faces following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and assesses whether Finland should pursue NATO membership. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin stated that an independent decision for Finland to pursue accession to the Western military alliance would be made in the coming weeks. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson expressed that Sweden is rethinking their security position and considering requesting to join NATO but did not specify a timeline for that decision. Andersson said that the Swedish government is working on a security environment report, similar to the report Finland issued, that is due at the end of May to assess whether Sweden should pursue NATO membership. Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev warned that Russia would more than double the number of forces in its western flank and deploy nuclear weapons to the Baltic region to restore “balance” to the Baltics if Finland and Sweden join NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western countries continued to search for alternatives to Russian energy while the Kremlin tried to downplay the effects of Western sanctions on its economy and energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EU and US diplomats told the New York Times on April 14 that the European Union is planning a phased ban on Russian oil imports, likely before the end of the year. The EU is unlikely to ban Russian gas imports, on which many Europeans rely for heating and electricity, in the immediate future. The EU began a phased ban on Russian coal imports on April 7.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Italy signed a declaration of intent with Algeria on April 11 to increase the supply of Algerian natural gas to Italy and wean itself off Russian energy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced on April 12 that Greece has accelerated plans to explore natural gas to wean itself off Russian energy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tass likely falsely claimed on April 10 that European states have recently significantly increased their purchases of Russian gas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world’s top oil trader, Vitol Group, announced on April 13 that it will stop trading Russian oil by the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated on April 8 that Russia will “reorient coal supplies to alternative markets” when the EU stops importing coal and emphasized that coal “is still a very popular commodity.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov told Russian newspaper Izvestia on April 13 that the Kremlin is prepared to sell oil and oil energy products at any price range to friendly countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted on April 14 that Western sanctions were disrupting the Russian energy sector and that payments for energy exports were under strain since sanctions by “unfriendly countries” have been delaying the transfer of funds. Putin warned that Western countries’ attempts to phase out Russian energy will have disastrous economic effects. Putin argued that there is no “reasonable replacement” for Russian gas and that supplies from other countries will cost Europeans much more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO countries continue to secure their eastern borders and provide military assistance to Ukraine to counter Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated on April 10 that NATO is working on developing a permanent military presence along its eastern borders given a perpetual Russian security threat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;US President Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on April 13 and pledged an additional $800 million in military assistance, including heavier weaponry such as artillery systems, armored personnel carriers, Javelins, helicopters, and 300 additional Switchblade drones. Anonymous US defense officials told the Washington Post on April 14 that the United States will resume directly training the Ukrainian military as part of the package.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Slovakia supplied Ukraine with an S-300 air defense system on April 8, highlighting NATO’s inclination to send heavier weaponry to Ukraine to help defend against Russian missiles and airstrikes. The United States sent one Patriot missile system, along with a US crew to operate it, to Slovakia as a replacement for its own defenses. Slovakia is reportedly also considering sending MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine to ensure the protection of its own airspace as it moves away from Russian military supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Australia announced on April 8 that it will send three Bushmaster armored personnel carriers to Ukraine with 17 more to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom will provide Ukraine with 120 armored vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems following United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on April 9.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell announced that the EU will allocate $544.3 million to provide weapons to the Ukrainian army on April 9.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Union has approved an additional $542 million to reimburse member states for military aid they are providing Ukraine on April 13.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The German company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann has offered to sell Ukraine 100 Panzerhaubitze 2000 self-propelled howitzers according to the German newspaper Welt.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Latvia stated on April 13 that it will train Ukrainian troops to use the drones it has provided Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;foreign-involvement&quot;&gt;Foreign Involvement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish Defense Company Baykar has likely sold additional military supplies to Ukraine since March 25. Two Ukrainian aircraft flew from Tekirdag, northwestern Turkey, to Rzeszow, Poland, on March 25 and April 10. Baykar’s training and armament shipping centers are located in Tekirdag. Ukraine has ordered at least 36 of Baykar’s Bayraktar TB2 armed drones and unspecified other military equipment in the past several years. Several Ukrainian officials also met with Baykar CEO Haluk Bayraktar and Turkish government officials to discuss “military-technical” cooperation on March 29-30 following March 29 Russian-Ukrainian talks in Istanbul, Turkey. Ukraine imported $59.1 million of Turkish defense products from Turkey in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $1.9 million in Q1 2021 — a thirty-fold increase. An anonymous Turkish official told Reuters on April 8 that Russian officials complained to Turkey over its drone sales to Ukraine. The Turkish government played down any governmental support to Baykar’s sales in response, likely to maintain critical defense and economic ties with Russia. However, Baykar is closely tied to the Turkish government, including through Selcuk Bayraktar, Baykar’s Chief Technology Officer and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s son-in-law. The Turkish government often plays the leading role in negotiating and approving defense sales between Turkish companies and foreign governments.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ISW Russia Team</name></author><summary type="html">This update covers events from April 8-14.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu3tWu0.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu3tWu0.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Ukraine Invasion Update 4/8</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-04-08-ukraine-invasion-update-22.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ukraine Invasion Update 4/8" /><published>2022-04-08T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-04-08T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/ukraine-invasion-update-22</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-04-08-ukraine-invasion-update-22.html">&lt;p&gt;This update covers events from April 2-7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian atrocities in Ukraine, Kremlin efforts to falsely blame Ukraine for these atrocities, and continuing Ukrainian battlefield successes have reduced the willingness of the Ukrainian government and society to reach a peace agreement less than total Russian defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky specified for the first time that Ukraine’s desired “security guarantees” in lieu of NATO membership are written commitments from several states to provide Ukraine with immediate military aid and enact sanctions on Russia in the event of further Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is blaming the United States for Russian atrocities against civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where Russian troops killed around 400 Ukrainian civilians. Western states imposed additional sanctions and expelled Russian diplomats in response to the Russian atrocities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is setting conditions to blame Ukraine for Russian atrocities in occupied areas and may be intentionally doing so in areas where the Kremlin knows Russian forces have already killed civilians to disguise Russian culpability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian forces are accelerating operations to install governance structures in occupied Ukraine and are detaining or killing Ukrainian mayors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kremlin media increasingly seeks to justify Russian atrocities and the intentional targeting of Ukrainian civilians to a Russian domestic audience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is attempting to frame the global economic consequences of its invasion of Ukraine as a result of Western sanctions to call for their removal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Newly announced weapons shipments from the United Kingdom and the United States will supplement Ukrainian supplies and expand Ukrainian capabilities to target Russian forces massed in southern Ukraine and in the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-events&quot;&gt;Key Events&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;negotiations&quot;&gt;Negotiations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine will not resume negotiations with Russia until Ukrainian and guarantor state negotiators finalize meaningful security guarantees for Ukraine. Russian atrocities in Ukraine and Kremlin efforts to falsely blame Ukraine for these atrocities have reduced the willingness of the Ukrainian government and society to reach a peace agreement less than total Russian defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky specified for the first time on April 5 that Ukraine’s desired “security guarantees” in lieu of NATO membership are written commitments from several states to provide Ukraine with immediate military aid and enact sanctions on Russia in the event of further Russian aggression. Zelensky said Ukraine seeks guarantor states that will “provide any kind of weapons within 24 hours” and impose sanctions within 24-72 hours to “repulse and isolate” Russia in the case of further Russian aggression against Ukraine. Zelensky stated on April 6 that the United States, United Kingdom, Turkey, Poland, Germany, France, and Israel have expressed varying degrees of willingness to provide security guarantees to Ukraine. Zelensky said that representatives of these states will meet “in the near future” and said that Ukraine will not resume negotiations with Russia until Ukraine and the guarantors reach an agreement. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz confirmed on April 6 that Germany and Ukraine are holding confidential bilateral discussions regarding security guarantees. Zelensky likely seeks a comprehensive package of military aid to Ukraine and pre-planned sanctions on Russia as a deterrent to replace Kyiv’s desired NATO membership. Negotiations on these guarantees will likely take some time, and Ukraine is unlikely to substantially reengage with Russian negotiators in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is increasingly falsely claiming that Western states are forcing Ukraine to continue the war, obfuscating continued Russian military setbacks. Several Kremlin officials falsely claimed that the West staged atrocities in Bucha to justify new sanctions and undermine negotiations. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova falsely claimed on April 7 that US and NATO state military aid to Ukraine is preventing a peaceful settlement or meaningful negotiations. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov falsely claimed that western states forced Ukrainian negotiators to issue a new proposal on April 6, removing initial promises that security guarantees to Ukraine would not apply to Crimea and that Russia would have the ability to veto any international military exercises in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anger over Russian atrocities and continuing Ukrainian battlefield successes are strengthening the Ukrainian government’s willingness to reject Russian demands. Zelensky said on April 5 that it will be difficult to meet with Putin following the Bucha massacre and stated he will only meet Putin if Russia will “bear all the punishments” for genocide and confirm that Ukraine will not lose any territory. Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov contrarily claimed on April 3 that Russia plans to continue negotiations with Ukraine, but that Putin will only meet with Zelensky after Russia and Ukraine reach a written agreement due to claimed “experience with Ukraine not fulfilling its obligations.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;kremlin-narratives&quot;&gt;Kremlin Narratives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin continued to set conditions for a potential chemical or biochemical false-flag attack against Ukraine for which it would blame Ukrainian forces and the West. The Kremlin has emphasized this long-running narrative since December 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia hosted a United Nations Security Council meeting on April 6 to discuss its false allegations of US-funded bioweapons laboratories in Ukraine. The United States and United Kingdom boycotted the meeting, while France and Norway attended but accused Russia of spreading disinformation. China and Brazil called for independent investigations into Russia’s claims. Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations Dai Bing said that China welcomes an international inquiry into US bio-military activities and called for greater transparency. China has echoed the Kremlin’s bioweapons narrative since March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chief of the Russian Military Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defense Forces Igor Kirillov claimed on April 6 that the Kremlin has discovered 30 US laboratories in 14 populated areas in Ukraine and linked the labs to the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called on the United States to provide more comprehensive information on alleged US biolabs in Ukraine on April 6.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kremlin-affiliated media amplified “expert” testimony from Kremlin-affiliated academics on April 5 claiming the United States and NATO developed “combat pathogens” in a network of biolaboratories surrounding Russia and Belarus to use against Russia because they are “too scared” to use a nuclear weapon against Russia. These reports claimed for the first time that Germany (rather than solely the US) maintains its own network of inter-related biolabs and implausibly claimed that both the United States and Germany are developing pathogens that would target only ethnic Russians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kremlin media increasingly seeks to justify Russian atrocities and the intentional targeting of Ukrainian civilians to a Russian domestic audience. Russian media amplified an op-ed written by Kremlin-affiliated film director Timofey Sergeytsev on April 3 that outlined specific steps to “denazify Ukraine” and sought to justify Russian atrocities. The op-ed claims the entire Ukrainian Armed Forces are Nazis and called for their total “liquidation.” The op-ed additionally stated Ukraine cannot be an independent state and called for a multi-generational effort to alter the educational, informational, and cultural infrastructure of Ukraine that would inevitably constitute “de-Ukrainization.” The op-ed called for the creation of “systemic conditions for the subsequent denazification in peacetime,” including the installation of a permanent Russian information space in Ukraine. The Russian State Duma additionally introduced a draft law on April 4 that would formally falsely claim “that Ukrainian authorities have committed a genocide of the Russian population since 2014.” Russian media continue to amplify this and other claims of the need for “denazification.” The Kremlin’s “denazification” rhetoric and growing calls to destroy Ukrainian society and culture are likely intended to condition Russia’s domestic population to accept further Russian atrocities in Ukraine and harsher crackdowns on civilian populations in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, particularly if Russia makes more permanent territorial gains in eastern Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-reactions-to-sanctions&quot;&gt;Russian Reactions to Sanctions:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is attempting to frame the global economic consequences of its invasion of Ukraine as a result of Western sanctions to call for their removal. The Kremlin may additionally plan to limit its agricultural exports and is threatening to nationalize European assets in Russia in retaliation for Western sanctions. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed on April 4 that anti-Russia sanctions are a “blow to the global economy” after a meeting with the Arab League Contact Group on Ukraine in Moscow, Russia. Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev stated on April 2 that food exports are Russia’s “quiet weapon” and threatened that Russia may limit agricultural exports to “unfriendly countries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin continues to threaten reciprocal sanctions and the nationalization of foreign assets as it attempts to leverage its energy exports. The Russian State Duma introduced a bill for discussion on April 4 to criminalize any entity that implements sanctions against Russia. Russian energy company Gazprom stopped supplying gas to Germany’s largest storage facility, Reden, on April 5 in likely retaliation for Germany’s nationalizing Gazprom Germania on April 4. Putin additionally threatened that Russia could nationalize European assets within Russia in response. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced on April 6 that Hungary will pay for Russian gas in rubles, undermining a European effort to avoid propping up the ruble with energy purchases. Meanwhile, the Kremlin continued to seek outlets for its sanctioned goods. Bloomberg reported on April 4 that Chinese state-owned liquified natural gas (LNG) companies are secretly planning to purchase sanctioned Russian gas at a reduced price, and the Kremlin will likely pursue other similar sanctions mitigation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-occupation&quot;&gt;Russian Occupation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is blaming the United States for Russian atrocities against civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. Western states imposed additional sanctions and expelled Russian diplomats in response to the Russian atrocities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian forces killed around 400 Ukrainian civilians throughout their occupation of the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. Ukrainian troops reported the civilian deaths of April 4 after recapturing the town. German outlet Der Spiegel reported on April 7 that German military intelligence intercepted Russian radio communications at minimum discussing the murder of civilians in Bucha and possibly indicating targeted killings of civilians were pre-planned.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin contradictorily claimed both that the United States faked videos taken in Bucha and that Ukrainian forces carried out actual killings. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharov denied any allegations of Russian involvement in civilian deaths in Bucha and claimed the United States is “organizing and orchestrating” an information war against Russia in a series of statements on April 4. Russia’s Permanent Representative to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Alexander Lukashevich claimed that Ukrainian forces faked reports of mass graves in and around Kyiv to derail peace talks. Peskov claimed that videos of the massacre in Bucha were staged forgeries distributed by the “Kyiv regime.” The Russian Investigative Committee opened an investigation into the spread of “disinformation” regarding the Bucha massacre on April 4. Zakharova separately claimed on April 4 that the Ukrainian military had committed the crimes in Bucha to derail peace talks. Russian Presidential Advisor Dmitry Medvedev attributed the atrocities in Bucha to Nazis and claimed that Ukrainians had been praying for the Third Reich. Russian representative to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzia claimed “only amateurs” would fall for the videos and falsely claimed that Russian forces do not target civilians. Russia’s Foreign Ministry claimed that the West had supported Ukraine’s “provocation” in Bucha and was as much a participant as Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;European and western allied states capitalized on renewed international unity to expel Russian diplomatic staff and further isolate Russia from the international community following the exposure of Russian atrocities. Several European Union states expelled Russian diplomats between April 4 and April 7 after the massacre in Bucha was discovered, with several explicitly citing atrocities in Bucha as justification while others listed national security concerns. Lithuania, Germany, France, Latvia, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Estonia, Romania, Greece, Norway, Luxembourg, Ireland, and Austria expelled over 200 diplomats combined. The United States and its allies introduced and passed a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly suspending Russia’s membership on the United Nations Human Rights Council following the atrocities. Russian state media avoided directly attributing Europe’s decisions to expel diplomats to the massacre committed in Bucha and described the expulsions as resulting from Russia’s “special operation” or occurring “against the backdrop” of Bucha.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is setting conditions to blame Ukraine for Russian atrocities in occupied areas and may be intentionally doing so in areas where the Kremlin knows Russian forces have already killed civilians to disguise Russian culpability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) People’s Militia claimed on April 6 that Ukrainian propagandists are planning a new “provocation” in the city of Kreminna by creating a “staged video” with the elderly and disabled to accuse Russian forces of atrocities against the population. The People’s Militia claimed that those who “participated in Bucha” will take part in this video. The Kremlin or LNR may be aware of atrocities in or around Kreminna and may be attempting to pre-empt accusations of Russian or LNR brutality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;National Defense Control Center of Russia Head Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev claimed on April 6 that Ukraine is collaborating with the West to prepare false materials documenting Russian atrocities and that their “[Bucha] scenario” will not work again. Mizintsev said that Western media have completed “provocations involving the civilian population in the cities of Konotop and Trostyanets in the Sumy region, as well as in Borodyanka and Katyuzhanka in the Kyiv region” — all cities previously occupied by Russian forces. He added that Ukraine is preparing “regular provocative materials” about the deaths of civilians in Derhachi, Kharkiv Oblast and claimed that Ukraine or Western media paid civilian crisis actors $25 for their participation. Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov reiterated that claim on April 7.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian state-owned news outlet RIA Novosti claimed on April 6 that Ukrainian forces are allegedly preparing to murder civilians in Chernihiv for aiding Russian troops.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukrainian media reported on April 6 that Russian “top leadership” ordered Russian forces to use mobile crematoriums to hide additional evidence of civilian deaths in occupied zones, likely to mitigate additional international backlash like Russia has faced from the reveal of the Bucha massacres.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces are accelerating operations to install governance structures in occupied Ukraine and are detaining or killing Ukrainian mayors. Permanent Crimean Representative to Russia Georgy Muradov stated on April 6 that Crimea and Russian-occupied southern Ukrainian territories have “restored a single economic complex” and replaced the Ukrainian hryvnia currency with the Russian ruble. Russian forces dispelled an opposition protest with gunfire and explosives in Energodar, Ukraine, on April 2, indicating ongoing Ukrainian resistance in occupied territory. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuck reported that Russian forces killed Motyzhyn Mayor Olga Sukhenko on April 2 and stated on April 3 that Russian forces have kidnapped 11 Ukrainian mayors since the invasion began. Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) officials appointed pro-Russian politician Konstantin Ivashchenko as mayor of Mariupol on April 5 despite the fact that Ukrainian conventional forces remain active in the city. Russian forces are likely killing other Ukrainian government officials as part of occupation measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drivers-of-russian-threat-perceptions&quot;&gt;Drivers of Russian Threat Perceptions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newly announced weapons shipments from the United Kingdom and the United States will supplement Ukrainian supplies and expand Ukrainian capabilities to target Russian forces massed in southern Ukraine and in the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK Ministry of Defense formally announced on April 7 it will send new long-range artillery and Harpoon weapon systems to Ukraine after UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace first discussed the shipments on April 2. These capabilities will threaten Russian naval operations in the Black Sea and would render an already-unlikely Russian assault on Odesa even less likely in the coming weeks. Russian Ambassador to the UK Andrey Kelin warned that long-range artillery weapons and anti-ship systems in the UK’s new military aid package to Ukraine would be “legitimate targets” in a statement on April 2.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States announced several new military aid packages from April 2-7 containing drones, armored vehicles, machine guns, Javelin anti-tank missile systems, and biological and chemical protective equipment totaling over $400 million USD. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin also stated that the United States is providing “intelligence to conduct operations in Donbas” to Ukraine during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on April 7.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US Senate passed the “Ukrainian Democracy Defense Lease Act” to waive legal requirements that slow the process of delivering aid to Ukraine on April 6. The US House of representatives is expected to vote on the bill after its two-week recess.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NATO announced at the conclusion of a NATO conference on April 7 that the bloc will send unspecified “NATO-standard” equipment and heavy weaponry to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne announced on April 7 that Australia will send “tactical decoys, unmanned aerial and ground systems, rations and medical supplies,” to Ukraine in its newest military aid package.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Czech defense official reported that the Czech Republic had recently sent T-72 tanks and BVP-1 infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine in a comment on April 5.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international response to Russian atrocities in Bucha, Ukraine, likely distracted the Kremlin from threatening rhetoric in response to Poland’s offer to station US nuclear weapons in Poland. Polish Deputy Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kacyznski stated on April 2 that Poland would like the United States to increase its troop presence in Europe from 100,000 to 150,000 and that Poland would be open to stationing US nuclear weapons on its territory. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov warned on April 3 that troop buildups in Europe would heighten tensions and argued that nuclear weapons in Poland were “anti-Russian” and a cause for concern. The Kremlin likely intended to escalate that rhetoric and may have begun to discuss stationing Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus. However, the Kremlin media apparatus has instead focused on containing the fallout from Russian atrocities in Bucha, Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ISW Russia Team</name></author><summary type="html">This update covers events from April 2-7.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu3tWu0.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu3tWu0.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Ukraine Invasion Update 4/2</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-04-02-ukraine-invasion-update-21.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ukraine Invasion Update 4/2" /><published>2022-04-02T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-04-02T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/ukraine-invasion-update-21</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-04-02-ukraine-invasion-update-21.html">&lt;p&gt;This update covers events from Mar 30 - Apr 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ongoing peace talks will likely protract, and the Kremlin is unlikely to withdraw its main demands in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia and Ukraine may have reached initial agreements on Ukrainian “neutrality” in ongoing negotiations, but remain stalled on the Kremlin’s refusal to discuss Crimea and the Donbas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin set additional conditions on March 30 - April 1 for a chemical or biochemical false-flag attack in eastern Ukraine or Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ongoing European efforts to find alternatives to Russian energy likely successfully undercut a Kremlin attempt to buttress the Russian economy by coercing Europe into buying Russian gas in rubles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sustained Western military aid to Ukraine will help enable further Ukrainian counterattacks in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-events&quot;&gt;Key Events&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;negotiations&quot;&gt;Negotiations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ongoing peace talks will likely protract, though Russia and Ukraine may have reached initial agreements on Ukrainian “neutrality.” However, the Kremlin is unlikely to drop its maximalist demands—which are inadmissible to Kyiv—in the near term. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated on March 30 that the March 29 negotiations in Istanbul on March 30 did not result in “anything too promising or any breakthroughs.” Lead Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky claimed on March 30 that Ukraine has stated its willingness to meet core Russian demands to end what the Kremlin claims is “the threat of creating a NATO bridgehead on Ukrainian territory” but clarified that only the “essence” of agreements was agreed on. Smaller Russian and Ukrainian delegations arrived in Jerusalem, Israel, on March 30 for further negotiations. Ukrainian and Russian negotiators resumed peace talks virtually on April 1 and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that Russia has not yet provided responses to Ukraine’s March 30 proposals. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the Kremlin is preparing a response to Ukraine’s March 30 proposals but did not provide a timeline for delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian government flatly denied Kremlin claims that Kyiv has agreed to Russian control over Crimea and Donbas. Lavrov falsely claimed on March 30 that “the issues of Crimea and Donbas have been finally resolved,” likely to maintain domestic support for the continued Russian military operation in Ukraine and to frame the operation as achieving its objectives. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko refuted Lavrov’s claims on March 30, asserting that Lavrov has an “erroneous understanding of the negotiation process” and that “the issues of Crimea and Donbas will finally be resolved after the restoration of Ukraine’s sovereignty over them.” The Kremlin is unlikely to drop its territorial demands and Kyiv is unlikely to meet them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyiv received initial positive rhetoric from several states on its demanded security guarantees in exchange for dropping its NATO aspiration, but the Kremlin is unlikely to accept any Western involvement in a possible peace deal. The United Kingdom, Germany, and Turkey separately stated their willingness to act as security guarantors for Ukraine in principle on March 30 and 31, though all three states declined to comment on specifics. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed on March 31 that the United States directly refused to give Ukraine security guarantees, citing US President Joe Biden’s assertion that the United States will not provide aid to Ukraine that would lead to direct US-Russia military conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;kremlin-narratives&quot;&gt;Kremlin Narratives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin set additional conditions on March 30 - April 1 for a chemical or biochemical false-flag attack in eastern Ukraine or Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian Defense Ministry Spokesperson Igor Konashenkov claimed on March 30 that Ukrainian forces “considered the possibility of using biological weapons against the Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) and the Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR)” with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Forces Head Igor Kirillov claimed on March 31 that Ukraine asked Bayraktar (the Turkish manufacturer of many of Ukraine’s UAVs) to equip Ukraine’s drones with an aerosol spraying mechanism for biological weapons in December 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian State Duma officials convened a committee on March 31 to “investigate” Russia’s repeated and false allegations that US biolabs are participating in “the development of biological weapons components in the immediate vicinity of the territory of Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian First Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations Dmitry Polyansky told Russian state media on April 1 that Ukrainian forces “plan to blow up railway containers containing up to 800 tons of chlorine” in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region and claimed that Russia is providing additional evidence of alleged Ukrainian biological weapons programs to the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISW warned on March 9 that the Kremlin may conduct a chemical or radiological false-flag attack and blame Ukraine, the United States, or NATO. Russian media would leverage a potential false flag attack to stoke domestic outrage and establish a pretext for further escalation in Ukraine or against NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-reactions-to-sanctions&quot;&gt;Russian Reactions to Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ongoing European efforts to find alternatives to Russian energy likely successfully undercut a Kremlin attempt to buttress the Russian economy by coercing Europe into only buying Russian gas in rubles. Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitri Medvedev stated on March 30 that sanctions against Russia may leave EU countries without gas, an implicit threat to cut off Russian energy exports to Europe. Russian President Vladimir Putin decreed on March 31 that “unfriendly countries” purchasing Russian gas must have Russian bank accounts and pay in rubles. The United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan separately announced on March 31 and April 1 that they would not meet the Kremlin’s demand to pay for gas in rubles, in effect calling the Kremlin’s bluff. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov backtracked on April 1 that Russia will indefinitely delay implementing Putin‘s decree, claiming the procedure would be “a long and time-consuming process.” Ongoing efforts by European and other states to reduce their reliance on Russian energy and preparations to ration existing energy reserves likely enabled them to refuse the Kremlin’s demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drivers-of-russian-threat-perceptions&quot;&gt;Drivers of Russian Threat Perceptions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustained Western military aid to Ukraine will help enable further Ukrainian counterattacks in the coming weeks. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated claims on March 31 that the United States and NATO are responsible for the Ukraine crisis for “pumping Ukraine full of weapons” that threatened Russia and violated Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) decisions. The United States and its allies continued to provide monetary and military supply assistance to Ukraine since ISW’s previous Invasion Update on March 29.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;US Pentagon Spokesperson John Kirby stated on March 29 that the United States is deploying six US Navy Growler electronic warfare aircraft, along with 240 US military personnel, to Germany to bolster electronic warfare capabilities on NATO’s eastern flank. Kirby noted that the aircraft will not be used in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin approved a deployment extension for the USS Harry Truman aircraft carrier on March 31. The carrier’s aircraft have been flying in support of NATO security operations in Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;US President Joe Biden pledged $500 million in direct budgetary aid to Ukraine in a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on March 30.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace reported on March 31 that the United Kingdom and its partners will send more lethal aid to Ukraine in the form of anti-aircraft assets, armored vehicles, and long-range artillery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on April 1 that Australia will send additional armored vehicles to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is falsely presenting its partial withdrawal of Russian forces from Kyiv and Chernihiv as a major Russian concession in service of peace talks with Ukraine. In reality, Russian forces are withdrawing to recuperate after suffering severe losses in their failed operations to seize those cities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko continues to withstand Russian pressure to enter the war in Ukraine on Russia’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is intensifying its internal censorship and crackdown on entities in Russia that do not cover the war in the Kremlin’s preferred terms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin denied reports of increased conscription on March 26 but is likely beginning a broader mobilization that will coincide with Russia’s annual spring conscription on April 1. These new conscription drives are unlikely to generate effective Russian combat power for many months, at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin maintained its defamatory narratives about claimed US involvement in Ukrainian biolaboratories and Russian nuclear capabilities to discredit and intimidate the West.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin continued to downplay the effects of Western sanctions on the Russian economy and threatened the West with counter-sanctions leveraging Russian energy exports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-events&quot;&gt;Key Events&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;negotiations&quot;&gt;Negotiations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian and Ukrainian negotiators met in Istanbul, Turkey, on March 29 as part of ongoing peace talks. The Kremlin is falsely framing the withdrawal of its forces that failed to capture Kyiv as a Russian concession. Kremlin rhetoric following the meeting was more open to further discussion and Ukrainian demands than throughout the first month of the invasion, but the Kremlin likely retains its maximalist objectives in Ukraine, and peace talks are unlikely to progress in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin’s claimed withdrawal of forces around Kyiv, which it seeks to portray as a “huge step” towards peace, is a cover for an ongoing redeployment of Russian forces after their failure to take Kyiv. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Colonel-General Alexander Fomin claimed on March 29 that Russia will “drastically reduce military activity in the Kyiv and Chernihiv directions” and provide details on Russia’s claimed withdrawal later this week. Chief Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky falsely framed this claimed withdrawal as a “huge step” toward peace that requires “counter-movement” from Ukraine. The Kremlin is attempting to falsely portray the failure of its campaign to encircle Kyiv, which ISW assessed had failed as of March 19, as an olive branch requiring a Ukrainian concession. Russian forces continue to fight to hold their front-line trace near the city, and Russian forces have been withdrawing into Belarus for rest and refit for several days – prior to the Russian announcement on March 29. Russia’s redeployment of forces to other fronts and continued shelling around Kyiv are not concessions and should not be treated as such by Ukraine and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kyiv remained firm that Ukraine must receive separate security guarantees if it abandons its NATO aspirations. Ukrainian officials called for the establishment of a security guarantee system for Ukraine (involving Russia, China, the United States, Germany, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and France) if Ukraine drops its NATO aspirations. None of those countries have publicly committed to such a system and are unlikely to do so; Kyiv will therefore likely refuse Russian demands to commit to not joining NATO.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s delegation offered possible limited concessions on territorial control but stated all Russian forces must withdraw prior to any territorial negotiations. Ukraine’s delegation presented an agreement stating Ukraine would not join NATO, would adopt a neutral status, and would not host foreign forces if Russia provided security guarantees and withdrew all its forces from Ukraine. Ukraine also offered a fifteen-year negotiation period on the future of the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula. Zelensky emphasized in a March 27 interview with Russian media that Russia should return its forces to the positions they held before the February 24 invasion prior to any dialogue on control over the Donbas. Zelensky left open the possibility of conceding parts of eastern Ukraine, emphasizing that “Ukrainian land is important, yes, but ultimately, it’s just a territory,” but also said that Ukraine would not compromise Ukrainian territory without “iron-clad” security guarantees. Ukrainian Presidential Advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said on March 29 that Ukraine will sign an international agreement on security guarantees only after holding a national referendum on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin said Ukraine’s proposal was “clearly formulated” after previously falsely claiming Kyiv refused to provide a firm position and stated the Kremlin will consider Kyiv’s proposal before responding. Medinsky stated on March 29 that Russia proposed to “expedite” plans to schedule a meeting between Zelensky and Putin to occur prior to the conclusion of negations. Medinsky stated Russia’s delegation will pass Ukraine’s “clearly formulated position” to President Putin, after which Moscow will give a response, but did not specify a timeline for further meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-domestic-opposition-and-censorship&quot;&gt;Russian Domestic Opposition and Censorship:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kremlin crackdowns on coverage of the war are increasingly prompting self-censorship among Russia’s few remaining independent outlets. The Russian Investigative Committee announced it is investigating more than 10 criminal cases of “fakes about the Russian army” as of March 25. Russian authorities continue to arrest individuals Russian President Vladimir Putin deemed “scum and traitors” for sharing what the Kremlin claims is false information about the war. Russian state censorship is increasingly prompting self-censorship by Russian media outlets. Russian media censor Roskomnadzor demanded on March 27 that Russian media refuse to publish interviews with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Leading independent Russian news outlet Novaya Gazeta announced on March 28 that it is suspending operations until after the war following warnings from Roskomnadzor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian reporting successfully forced the Kremlin to respond to rumors about the absence of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu from Kremlin broadcasts and reports. Shoigu reappeared in a Kremlin-published video on March 26 following a two-week absence. Ukrainian Internal Affairs Minister Adviser Anton Gerashcenko claimed on March 26 that Shoigu’s condition has deteriorated following a heart attack at an unspecified date and that the March 26 video was previously recorded on March 11, though ISW cannot independently verify this claim. Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov has also not appeared in public for several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;kremlin-narratives&quot;&gt;Kremlin Narratives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin denied reports of increased conscription on March 26 but is likely beginning a broader mobilization. Russia’s Defense Ministry denied claims on March 26 that it is calling Russian reservists to military enlistment offices and instead claimed that Ukrainian intelligence is issuing fake calls imitating Russian officials. Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) stated on March 28 that Russia will begin conscription through the BARS-2021 (Combat Army Reserve of the Country) program on April 1, 2022, alongside the normal semi-annual conscription cycle on April 1 to “conceal mass mobilization measures.” Such a recruitment drive would be unlikely to provide Russian forces around Ukraine with sufficient combat power to restart major offensive operations in the near term. Russia’s pool of available well-trained replacements remains low, and new conscripts will require months to reach even a minimum standard of readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin continues to advance information operations seeking to discredit the US government’s cooperation with Ukraine, claiming it is conducting an “investigation” into what it claims are US-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine that could be used to conduct chemical attacks. Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov stated on March 25 that Russia will continue to investigate what it claims are US-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine. The Russian State Duma’s Deputy Chair of CIS Affairs Viktor Vodolatsky announced on March 26 that Russia planned to present the results of its investigation into alleged US-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine to the United Nations. Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev stated on March 29 that the United States must explain its financing of alleged Ukrainian biolaboratories. Patrushev also falsely accused the United States of developing bioweapons that can selectively target specific populations on March 29.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peskov claimed that US reports of Russia’s use of banned munitions are attempts to divert attention from US-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine. The Donetsk People’s Republic denied claims on March 26 that Russian forces used white phosphorous munitions in Ukraine. Izvestiya correspondent Lenoid Kitrar claimed on March 26 to have visited the Chernobyl laboratory for the study of radioactive waste and alleged that Ukrainian workers confiscated important documents before abandoning the facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev outlined the conditions under which Russia would use nuclear weapons on March 26 in an effort to intimidate the west. Medvedev’s stated conditions were: the use of nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies; an attack on Russian critical infrastructure that paralyzes their nuclear response forces; or an act of aggression against Russia or its allies that threatens the existence of the state. The Kremlin is leaving the extent of what it considers an existential threat to Russia or its allies (notably including Belarus) intentionally ambiguous. Medvedev separately noted that the 2010 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, later extended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, is subject to a unique clause wherein “international treaties are only valid as long as the circumstances that gave rise to them exist,” and that those circumstances have disappeared, implying that Russia is no longer obligated to follow the treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-reactions-to-sanctions&quot;&gt;Russian Reactions to Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin continues to claim it can weather the effect of Western sanctions and promised to implement counter-sanctions that will further isolate Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated on March 28 that Russia will create a package of countermeasures in response to unfriendly US actions. Lavrov also stated that Russia will restrict entry into Russia from “unfriendly states.” Russian Industry and Trade Minister Denis Maturov claimed on March 27 that Russia will rebuild all of its supply chains within 3-6 months, which is highly unlikely. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing income tax breaks from 2021 to 2023 on March 26 to mitigate the impacts of sanctions. Russia also banned foreigners from withdrawing funds from the Russian financial system on March 25. Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev stated on March 25 that the West’s “stupid sanctions” are strengthening domestic support for the Kremlin. Lavrov stated on March 25 that most states will not join the West’s sanction “games” and accused the West of launching a “hybrid, total war” with sanctions. The Kremlin remains focused on downplaying the effect of sanctions for a domestic audience but is unlikely to mitigate the damage to its economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;belarus&quot;&gt;Belarus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko continues to withstand Russian pressure to enter the war in Ukraine on Russia’s behalf. Lukashenko reiterated on March 25 that he does not have “plans to fight in Ukraine” and that Belarusian citizens “do not accept war at a genetic level.” However, Belarus continues to logistically support Russia’s military operation. The Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs announced on March 26 that any Belarusian citizens who fight against Russia in Ukraine or who sabotage Belarusian infrastructure will face terrorism charges. The ministry additionally blamed Belarusian opposition leaders for coordinating a “criminal” foreign battalion - a reference to a pro-Ukrainian Belarusian volunteer unit that is operating in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-occupation&quot;&gt;Russian Occupation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is intensifying efforts to establish a formal military regime in occupied areas of Ukraine and is kidnapping Ukrainian citizens in a likely attempt to reduce Ukrainian resistance and use civilians as hostages in future negotiations. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry stated on March 29 that Russian forces have kidnapped nearly 30 Ukrainian officials, activists, and journalists and forcibly deported over 40,000 Ukrainian citizens to Belarus and Russia. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied this report and improbably claimed Russia has no data on Russian arrests of Ukrainian officials. Russian forces are additionally increasing steps to establish an occupation regime in Ukraine. The Kremlin’s United Russia party opened an office on the outskirts of Mariupol on March 25 to disseminate party newspapers, propaganda, and cellphone SIM cards. Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister for Crimea Georgy Muradov announced the formation of civil-military administrations in occupied southern Ukraine on March 26 and claimed Russian TV channels are broadcasting in Kherson and south of Zaporizhzhia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drivers-of-russian-threat-perceptions&quot;&gt;Drivers of Russian Threat Perceptions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kremlin officials claimed US President Joe Biden’s March 26 statement in Poland that Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power” demonstrates the US has no interest in diplomacy. The White House later clarified that “the president’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region” and was not calling for regime change in Russia. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated on March 26 that Biden’s comments about Putin “narrow the window of opportunity” for bilateral relations. Russian media additionally mischaracterized Biden’s statements to claim the US will deploy US forces to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is attempting to leverage its energy exports to Europe to prop up the ruble as Western restrictions on Russian energy exports erode this Russian economic lifeline. The United States and the European Commission (EC) announced a new task force on March 25 to supply Europe with 15 billion cubic meters of US liquified gas to wean European nations off of their reliance on Russian fuel. EU Foreign Affairs and Security Policy High Representative Josep Borell stated on March 28 that the EU plans to abandon the Russian gas market within two years. Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that European importers pay for Russian energy in rubles on March 23, a direct attempt to restore the value of the ruble and mitigate the effect of international sanctions. G7 energy ministers rejected Putin’s demands to pay for Russian gas with rubles on March 28, citing breaches in existing gas import contracts. Separately, Ukraine is likely attempting to limit the willingness of states to import Russian energy. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Qatari energy producers to increase their exports to Europe to undercut Russia’s efforts to put pressure on European markets through an energy crisis on March 26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO and EU countries continue to provide lethal and non-lethal military aid to Ukraine and bordering NATO countries and increased defense measures to counter Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sweden announced on March 25 that it will increase its defense spending by $300 million to provide support to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Estonian president Alar Karis called for a permanent NATO presence on the eastern border on March 28.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US Department of Defense deployed six Navy electronic warfare aircraft and 240 troops to Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany to reinforce NATO’s eastern flank on March 28.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;US President Joe Biden’s new 2023 budget proposal includes $6.9 billion for the European Deterrence Initiative and for NATO to counter Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Abkhazia’s military reportedly moved to high-readiness status in response to NATO exercises in Georgia on March 27.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kyiv remains firm that Russia must return Crimea and Donbas to Ukraine, despite Kremlin claims that Zelensky is willing to discuss recognizing Russian control over these temporarily occupied territories.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin increased its rhetoric accusing the West of posing an existential threat to Russia and refusing to rule out the use of nuclear weapons in the event of threats to Russia to deter the West from further supporting Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Western leaders continued to sound alarms about potential Russian chemical or biological attacks in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin continues to undercount Russian deaths in Ukraine, which have likely passed 10,000 dead since February 24.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Western sanctions are successfully disrupting Russia’s military industry and energy exports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian forces are likely forcibly relocating Ukrainian citizens to Russia to establish control over occupied areas and gain political leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EU and NATO announced both short- and long-term plans to increase military defense spending, troop deployments to Eastern Europe, and military assistance for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-events&quot;&gt;Key Events&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;negotiations&quot;&gt;Negotiations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian officials remain firm that Russia must return Crimea and Donbas; the Kremlin increasingly claims Kyiv is stalling negotiations. Russia is unlikely to reduce its maximalist demands despite the failure of its initial military campaign. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Foreign Minister Dmyto Kuleba stated on March 22 and 24 respectively that Ukraine must regain control of Crimea and Donbas, refuting Russian media claims that Zelensky would discuss recognizing Russia’s illegally occupied territories. Kuleba also said that Ukraine is negotiating security guarantees with the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Turkey. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on March 23 that Russia does not oppose Western mediation in Russia-Ukraine negotiations but repeated that Russia has “red lines” on Ukrainian integration into Western structures. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on March 22 that peace talks with Ukraine were moving slower than expected. Lavrov and Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed that Ukraine is constantly changing its position under manipulation from the United States. The Kremlin likely incorrectly anticipated a quick Ukrainian capitulation, but is unlikely to reduce its maximalist demands in the near term and the war will likely protract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-domestic-opposition-and-censorship&quot;&gt;Russian Domestic Opposition and Censorship&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin began implementing new laws against spreading “fakes” about its war in Ukraine and increasingly seeks to convince Russian citizens that any opposition to the war is treason. Moscow’s Presnensky Court detained a Russian citizen in the first criminal case for spreading “fakes” about Russian military activities in Ukraine on March 22. The pro-Kremlin political party “A Just Russia” encouraged civilians to persecute anti-Kremlin dissent by launching a website on March 21 to report authorities’ “intentional shortcomings” and turn in “traitors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin continued measures to control the domestic information space by regulating YouTube and Google News. YouTube unblocked the Russian State Television and Radio Fund channels in Russia on March 24, complying with a Roskomandzor demand made on March 19. Roskomnadzor also blocked Google News on March 23 and claimed that the platform provided “fake information” about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin will likely attempt to coerce other Western companies to retain or restart operations in Russia in exchange for complying with Russian government censorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isolated signs of dissent are appearing among Russian government officials. Russian Special Representative for Relations with International Organizations Anatoly Chubais resigned on March 23 and has likely left Russia. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov announced the “dismissal” of Chubais later in the day and maintained Chubais did not resign over Ukraine on March 24. Chubais was the chief of staff for former Russian President Boris Yeltsin and is the highest-ranking official to publicly break ties with the Kremlin after the invasion of Ukraine. Bloomberg also reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin rejected Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina’s resignation sometime shortly after the invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;kremlin-narratives&quot;&gt;Kremlin Narratives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin labeled Western actions surrounding Ukraine as potential “existential threats,” seeking to intimidate the West and possibly set conditions to use nuclear weapons. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov refused to rule out Russian use of nuclear weapons if it faces an “existential threat” during an interview with CNN on March 22. Other Kremlin mouthpieces warned about Western efforts to subjugate and destroy Russia in the following days. Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev claimed on March 23 that the United States aims to “humiliate, limit, and destroy” Russia before targeting China, claiming this will result in a “nuclear explosion.” Kremlin Spokesperson Maria Zakharova echoed these claims on March 23. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed on March 23 that the West seeks to establish a unipolar world order and that Ukraine was “chosen as a tool” to suppress Russia’s independence. Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky accused the West of putting “the very existence of Russia at stake” on March 24. The Kremlin likely seeks to intimidate Western states into limiting their activity in Ukraine by portraying a low threshold for “existential threats” that would prompt Russian use of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin continued to promote disinformation about US-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine and US chemical weapons in Europe to set conditions for a potential false-flag chemical or biological attack. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov claimed on March 22 that the United States had not destroyed its alleged chemical weapon arsenal in Europe and that Russia cannot tolerate US-funded biolaboratories that could develop biological weapons in Ukraine. The Russian State Duma opened an investigation into the alleged US-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine on March 22, and Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin demanded that President Biden explain his son’s involvement in Ukrainian biolaboratories on March 24. The Kremlin also began fabricating baseless evidence to support their claims. The Russian Embassy in South Africa tweeted a map of alleged Pentagon biolaboratories in Ukraine on March 22. Russian Defense Ministry Representative Igor Konashenkov claimed on March 24 that Russia had obtained documents from Ukrainian biolaboratory employees that indicate direct US involvement. The Ukrainian Center for Countering Disinformation claimed on March 24 that the Kremlin is flooding the Russian information space with these “false reports” and stressing the need for Russia to strike Ukraine pre-emptively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western leaders are escalating their warnings that Putin is considering staging a false-flag chemical or biological attack in Ukraine. US President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz separately warned on March 23 that Russian claims of Ukrainian and US biological weapons indicate a “real threat” that Putin is considering deploying such weapons himself. NATO approved an aid package to Ukraine with equipment to detect, protect, and respond to a chemical weapons attack on March 24. ISW previously assessed on March 9 that the Kremlin is setting informational conditions to possibly blame Ukraine for a Russian chemical or radiological false-flag attack against civilians as a pretext for further Russian escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian military continues to suppress Russian casualty numbers, which have likely surpassed 10,000 dead. Pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda reported and quickly deleted an article on March 22 citing the Russian Defense Ministry that 9,861 Russian soldiers have been killed and 16,153 have been wounded in Ukraine. Komsomolskaya Pravda claimed that hackers posted the “fake news,” and Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the initial report. The Kremlin released new casualty figures on March 25 stating 1,351 soldiers had been killed and 3,825 wounded, likely a severe undercount. By comparison, NATO estimated on March 23 that 7,000-15,000 Russian troops have been killed in the current invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-reactions-to-sanctions&quot;&gt;Russian Reactions to Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western sanctions are successfully degrading Russia’s military industry and energy exports despite Russian efforts to mitigate their impact. The Kyiv Independent reported on March 22 that Russia’s largest tank manufacturer, Uralvagonzavod, suspended operations due to supply shortages stemming from Western sanctions. On the same day, the Russian Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation (FSMTC) established an “operational headquarters” to mitigate the impact of sanctions on the Russian military-industrial complex. Russian President Vladimir Putin tried to allay fears about sanctions on March 23, claiming food rushes in Russia had fallen. The Moscow Exchange Index reported a rise of 4.5% on its first open trading day on March 24 after a one-month closure. Putin also announced that Russia will only send energy exports to designated “unfriendly” states if they pay in rubles, a move likely intended to both punish Western states and mitigate sanctions. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged European states not to make gas payments in rubles; German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany would not pay for gas in rubles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, United Kingdom, EU, and G-7 countries announced more sanctions against Russian officials and entities on March 24, including State Duma members and the Wagner Group. Western countries also continued freezing and seizing Russian state and businessmen’s assets as more private companies ended operations in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-occupation&quot;&gt;Russian Occupation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces are likely forcibly relocating citizens from Ukraine to establish control over occupied areas and gain political leverage. The Mariupol City Council claimed on March 24 that Russian soldiers have forcibly deported 15,000 Ukrainian civilians to Russia. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry claimed on March 24 that Russian forces transported at least 6,000 civilian hostages to camps and plan to relocate thousands more to gain political leverage over Ukraine. Russian forces may additionally use forcibly relocated Ukrainian civilians as hostages in negotiations with Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drivers-of-russian-threat-perceptions&quot;&gt;Drivers of Russian Threat Perceptions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union (EU) and NATO agreed on plans to increase short- and long-term military defense spending and troop deployments to Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced that NATO members agreed to double their Defense Investment Pledge to support deployments of four battlegroups to Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria during a NATO summit on March 24. NATO battlegroups consist of approximately 1,000 soldiers. The new deployment will double the number of battlegroups on NATO’s eastern flank.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Council (EC) passed the Strategic Compass legislation on March 22 to increase defense spending and enhance military and technological capabilities by 2030. The legislation will improve deployment capacity and agility as well as advance the EU’s counterintelligence and cybersecurity programs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EU doubled its military assistance for Ukraine from 500 million euros (about $550 million), last budgeted in February 2020, to 1 billion euros (about $1.01 billion) on March 23.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom announced further defensive military aid shipments to Ukraine, including thousands of anti-tank missiles, on March 23 and 24.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for unlimited military aid “without restrictions” to help Ukraine protect itself from Russia during an address to NATO members on March 24.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;foreign-involvement&quot;&gt;Foreign Involvement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish and Israeli efforts to mediate a ceasefire in Ukraine are unlikely to succeed in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on March 22 that Turkey is holding frequent discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to reach a ceasefire agreement. Turkish Foreign Minister Melvut Cavusolgu also encouraged fellow NATO members to focus on bringing about a ceasefire agreement instead of only applying sanctions at the March 24 NATO summit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett offered to mediate peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Kyiv, Ukraine, in an official statement on March 22.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennet discussed Ukraine on March 23, their sixth call since February 24.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China continued to protect Russia in international organizations while Western countries condemned Chinese political support for Russia and warned Beijing against supplying material support to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said that no G-20 member has the right to expel another, amid reports Western countries are considering removing Russia from the economic bloc on March 23.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky Andriy Yermak called on March 22 for China to play a more active role in pushing Russia to end the war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg accused China of politically supporting Russia and said on March 23 that NATO is “concerned” China could begin supplying material support soon. However, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on March 22 that the United States still had no evidence that China was sending military equipment to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is unlikely to withdraw its maximalist political demands of Ukraine in ongoing negotiations, despite the Russian military failing to achieve its objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin staged a 195,000-person rally in Moscow attended by President Putin on March 18 to falsely portray high levels of public support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kremlin bans of Facebook, Instagram, and other major western platforms in Russia are likely intended to coerce these companies to meet Russian censorship standards to retain their market share in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian officials continue to downplay the impact of new sanctions and proposed retaliatory measures against international companies that have left Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin continued to set conditions for a possible false flag chemical or radiological attack in Ukraine by promoting false claims of threats from United States-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eastern European NATO heads of state called for a more proactive NATO military posture and response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in the leadup to an emergency NATO summit on March 24.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China publicly stated it will not provide financial or military assistance to Russia and pledged further humanitarian assistance to Ukraine but blamed the United States for the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-events&quot;&gt;Key Events&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;negotiations&quot;&gt;Negotiations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin retains its maximalist political demands in ongoing negotiations with Ukraine and is unlikely to soften them despite the Russian military failing to achieve its objectives. Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated Russia’s political demands in a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on March 17. The Kremlin demands that Ukraine become “neutral” by renouncing its NATO membership ambitions, demilitarize by halting all western military aid or weapons sales to Ukraine, and “denazify.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov defined the “denazification” of Ukraine as the abolition of any laws that discriminate against Russian-speaking populations on March 18 — the first time a senior Kremlin official has publicly stated the Kremlin’s definition of Ukrainian “denazification.” Putin additionally stated that Ukrainian negotiators must resolve these issues before he will engage in leadership-level negotiations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the status of Crimea and Donbas. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov accused Ukraine on March 18 of prolonging the negotiations and delaying an agreement with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish mediation efforts are unlikely to lead to a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for direct negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 19, but Chief Turkish Presidential Advisor Ibrahim Kalin stated that Putin was not ready for such talks. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu claimed Russia and Ukraine were close to an agreement on “critical issues” on March 20, possibly signaling a ceasefire. However, head Ukrainian negotiator Mikhalo Podolyak said on March 17 that negotiations on “disputed points” could take anywhere from several days to one and a half weeks, and Peskov denied that negotiators are currently considering a ceasefire on March 21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian negotiators and government officials are signaling their willingness to concede on NATO membership aspirations but are highly unlikely to meet Russia’s other demanded concessions. President Zelensky signaled he is willing to consider a Ukrainian neutrality policy in return for other security guarantees from Western states during an interview with CNN on March 20. Zelensky stated on March 20 that Ukraine will not agree to any deal that forces it to surrender territory or sovereignty. Zelensky also said on March 21 that any agreement with Russia would be subject to a country-wide referendum before being adopted. Ukraine is highly unlikely to make any major concessions to Russia due to the current military stalemate and failure of Russia’s initial campaign plans. The Ukrainian population is additionally highly unlikely to support any major concessions to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-domestic-opposition-and-censorship&quot;&gt;Russian Domestic Opposition and Censorship&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kremlin bans on Facebook, Instagram, and other major western platforms in Russia are likely intended to coerce these companies to meet Russian censorship standards to retain their market share in Russia. A Moscow District Court blocked Facebook and Instagram from operating in Russian territory on March 21 due to its claimed “extremist activities,” citing Facebook’s decision to not block calls for the death of Russian soldiers in Ukraine, though calls for violence against Russian civilians remain violations of Facebook’s user guidelines. The Kremlin likely intends for this ban to coerce Facebook and other western companies active in Russia to meet Kremlin information demands and the Russian prosecutor general’s office said that it would not punish individual Russians for using VPNs and other measures to access Facebook and Instagram shortly after the ruling. Over 34 million Russian Instagram users could still use the platform as of March 20 despite the Kremlin’s ban of the site and VPN services. Kremlin-run media also amplified reports from anonymous Russian officials on March 18 that Russian state censoring agency Roskomnadzor could ban YouTube in the “coming days.” Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said social media companies will need to prove a “good attitude towards Russia and its citizens” to be unbanned. The Kremlin continues to target Russian journalists and teachers who do not follow the Kremlin’s line on the war in Ukraine. St. Petersburg police arrested several Russian journalists covering anti-war protests on March 19. Russian officials have also arrested several teachers who refuse to discuss the war in Ukraine according to state standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;kremlin-narratives&quot;&gt;Kremlin Narratives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin staged a 195,000-person rally in Moscow attended by President Putin and other pro-war protests throughout Russia on March 18 to falsely portray high levels of public support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Putin celebrated the eighth anniversary of Russia’s annexation of Crimea at a Moscow stadium and gave a speech promoting the war in Ukraine. Putin, Kremlin officials, and prominent Russian musical performers advanced the Kremlin’s narrative that the war to “denazify” Ukraine has created historic unity among Russians. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed on March 21 that the rally demonstrated the vast popular support for Putin’s decisions and Russian combat in Ukraine. The Kremlin forced government employees to attend and paid attendees. Social media users reported witnessing advertisements to attend the rally a few days prior to the event. Many participants reportedly left the rally as soon as 30 minutes after entering the stadium. Although the rally was likely successful for TV propaganda, the Kremlin faces continued domestic resistance to the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin continued to set conditions for a possible false-flag chemical or radiological attack in Ukraine by promoting false claims of threats from US-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine. The Kremlin has proliferated false claims about threats from US-sponsored biolabs in Ukraine since at least 2020. Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasized the “unacceptability” of claimed US military-sponsored biological activities in Ukraine during a conversation with the Luxembourger prime minister on March 19. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov promoted this narrative in public comments about US-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine on March 18. The Russian Defense Ministry called an ammonia leak at a chemical plant in Sumy, Ukraine, on March 21 a Ukrainian “provocation” despite reports that Russian shelling caused the leak. Russian media also circulated claims about increased radioactivity levels in the Black Sea and misquoted statements by UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace to claim the UK supports Ukraine developing nuclear weapons on March 21. ISW previously assessed that the Kremlin is setting informational conditions to possibly blame Ukraine for a Russian-conducted or Russian-fabricated chemical or radiological false-flag attack against civilians as a pretext for further Russian escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-reactions-to-sanctions&quot;&gt;Russian Reactions to Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian officials downplayed the impact of new sanctions and proposed retaliatory measures against international companies that have left Russia. EU member states, Australia, and Japan banned certain exports to Russia and imposed new sanctions targeting Russian individuals, assets, and companies between March 18-21. Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasized that Russian businesses should not fear sanctions on March 17. Kremlin officials claim that Russia has grown accustomed to sanctions and has a sufficient “margin of safety” to protect the Russian economy from Western sanctions that they claim the West would have imposed anyway to limit Russia’s development. Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev stated on March 19 that sanctions against Russia are “temporary” and claimed that Western citizens will suffer economic consequences from losing access to Russian energy. Evgeny Fedorov, Chairman of the Russia State Duma (Parliament) Committee on Economic Policy and member of the ruling United Russia party, proposed a bill to ban companies that left Russia from resuming operations for ten years on March 18. The Kremlin likely seeks to deter other international companies from halting their operations in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-occupation&quot;&gt;Russian Occupation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces continue to detain local civil society leaders and civilians in Ukraine and set conditions to govern occupied areas of Ukraine. The Russian military detained local leaders and media personnel in Enerhodar, Melitopol, and a village in Kharkiv Oblast between March 18-21. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry also accused the Kremlin on March 21 of shipping Mariupol citizens to detention camps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drivers-of-russian-threat-perceptions&quot;&gt;Drivers of Russian Threat Perceptions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eastern European NATO heads of state called for a more proactive NATO military posture and response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in the leadup to an emergency NATO summit on March 24.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki announced on March 18 that Poland will formally propose a NATO peacekeeping mission in Ukraine to protect international aid deliveries to Ukraine at a planned March 24 NATO summit. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov denounced Poland’s suggestion as “demagogic” on March 19 and claimed that NATO peacekeeping forces would take control of western Ukraine. The Polish ambassador to the United States said the mission is not intended to provoke Russian aggression on March 20. The US ambassador to the United Nations (UN) announced that the US would not participate in any possible NATO mission in Ukraine on March 20.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas argued that NATO should switch from a “deterrence posture” to a “defense posture” during an interview on March 20. Kallas suggested that NATO members should increase their NATO military spending to supplement smaller member-states’ defense capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov announced on March 19 during a joint press conference with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin that Bulgaria is establishing a multinational NATO battlegroup, including a US Stryker company, and will lead military exercises designed to bolster Bulgarian and NATO military readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;foreign-involvement&quot;&gt;Foreign Involvement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China publicly stated it will not provide financial or military assistance to Russia and pledged further humanitarian assistance to Ukraine but blamed the United States for the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;US President Joe Biden met virtually with Chinese President Xi Jinping on March 18. Biden emphasized that China would face significant consequences from the West if it accepted Russian President Vladimir Putin’s request for Chinese support. Xi urged the United States to negotiate with Russia and blamed the United States for the crisis. Russian media framed Xi Jinping’s statements on March 18 as a rejection of the United States and claimed that Xi is growing closer to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng blamed NATO expansion for the war and emphasized China’s opposition to Western sanctions against Russia on March 19 at a conference in Beijing, China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese Ambassador to the United States Qin Gang stated on March 20 that China is not considering sending financial or military assistance to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s Foreign Ministry announced on March 21 that China will send an additional $1.57 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine, supplementing roughly $790,000 in aid it sent earlier in March.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel rejected Ukraine’s request for military equipment on March 21 and opted to provide humanitarian aid instead. Israel continues to seek to maintain its neutrality between Ukraine and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ISW Russia Team</name></author><summary type="html">This update covers events from March 18-21.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/wJEFJrD.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/wJEFJrD.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
