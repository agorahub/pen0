&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZMnOETB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（26日）踏入審訊第51天。控方昨表示上周六（22日）始破解第三名控方證人鍾錦麟的電話，辯方需時審視昨午才收到的逾2,400則訊息，押至今天處理。辯方今表示仍需時審視，望於下周才傳召鍾錦麟，法官陳慶偉押至下周四（5月4日）續審，又向控方指「不希望再有任何意外和延遲」。法官李運騰關注審訊進度，提及他於9月底有案件要處理，又指除不認罪的16名被告，亦需時處理其餘31人的求情判刑。翻查資料，黎智英及《蘋果日報》3間公司涉勾結外國勢力案定於9月底開審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方需時審視新訊息-鍾錦麟押至下周四作供-官不希望再有任何任何意外和延遲&quot;&gt;辯方需時審視新訊息 鍾錦麟押至下周四作供 官：不希望再有任何任何意外和延遲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方昨表示，於上周六（22日）始破解鍾錦麟電話，並於昨午向辯方提供逾2,400則訊息。控方稱不會依賴新資料，辯方則指需時審視，押後至今天處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文今表示，團隊仍在審視新的WhatsApp訊息和附件，亦需向當事人索取指示，建議鍾錦麟的主問押後至本周五開始，並望能於當天完結，可於下周四開始盤問，並指大部分辯方律師均同意。法官早前宣布，明天（27日）、下周二及周三（5月2日及3日）均不開庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nEjEVLt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 則表示，雖然他有助手能讀中文，但他不能，故其進度較慢，希望下周才傳召鍾錦麟。坐在 Beel 身旁的大律師黃廷光沒有配戴假髮，法官陳慶偉一度着 Beel：「叫你的鄰座戴上他的假髮」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉遂指，不認為有太大分別，或可於下星期開始，期間各方也可索取指示，又向控方指：「我不希望再有任何意外和延遲。（I hope there won’t be any more surprise and delay.）」，多名被告發笑。主控萬德豪表示，應不會再有類似的披露情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉表示，他此前曾代表鍾錦麟作保釋申請。法官李運騰問是在另一宗案件？馬指是這宗案件，但是在最早的保釋申請階段，而其後的發展與他無關。他又指，控方和辯方均知悉此情況，沒有人反對。陳慶偉表示明白，會再考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官關注審訊進度-指需處理31人求情&quot;&gt;官關注審訊進度 指需處理31人求情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後表示，由於趙家賢已完成作供，相信之後的證人需時較短，問審訊是否仍預計需時90日？萬德豪指，視乎可同意多少事實，仍與辯方商討。李運騰指越快越好，因他在9月底有很重大的案件要處理（very substantive engagement），又指考慮到法官的數量，更換法官並不可行。李又指，大律師關文渭也有參與該案，關則指主控周天行亦有參與該案。翻查資料，壹傳媒創辦人黎智英與《蘋果日報》3間公司被控「串謀勾結外國勢力」等罪，原定今年9月25日開審，李運騰為該案主審法官之一，本案主控周天行亦為該案主控。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪表示，預計本周能給予答覆。李運騰再指，除了不認罪的16名被告，尚要處理其餘31名被告的判刑，假設每天可聽取兩人求情，31人也需要兩星期，還未計可能要爭拗案情撮要。萬德豪指會盡力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師黃宇逸最後表示，希望控方能提供將會傳召的證人名單，法官着他直接問控方。聆訊不足10分鐘完結。&lt;/p&gt;

It provides an overview of the priorities of five countries (the UK, the US, Canada, Japan, and Singapore) and the EU. The focus rests on cyber policy advanced in the period from January 2019 to March 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research underlying this paper focuses on four key research areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The general context in which cyber policy is made.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Priorities with regard to the protection of critical national infrastructure (CNI).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approaches to the development of cyber skills and the cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;International cooperation on norm development for cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-context&quot;&gt;The Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All jurisdictions follow a unique cyber strategy, but common approaches exist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategies are updated in line with domestic timelines but also adjust to changes in the cyber threat landscape (such as the rise of cybercrime) and respond to geopolitical events and the increased need to secure CNI and supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategies increasingly focus on harmonising and streamlining each jurisdiction’s cyber policies to avoid fragmentation and duplication of efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is an increasing reliance on interventionist policies and regulations to enhance resilience and cyber-security standards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-critical-national-infrastructure&quot;&gt;On Critical National Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring greater protection of critical national infrastructure (CNI) is a priority for all jurisdictions examined. This is often done by updating or increasing existing cyber-security obligations, or expanding them beyond CNI sectors to further support the resilience of supply chains. International businesses and cyber-security professionals must simultaneously comply with changing (and at times varying) obligations among different jurisdictions. Further research comparing the differing scopes of CNI designations and their respective cyber-security obligations is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-the-cyber-workforce&quot;&gt;On the Cyber Workforce&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global cyber-security workforce shortage and the need for further skills development is seen in all jurisdictions examined. A wide range of initiatives, many of which resemble each other, are advanced by the respective jurisdictions to attract talent, diversify the workforce and increasingly harmonise existing efforts. For example, several jurisdictions have adopted skills frameworks, such as the US’s National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework or the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF), to harmonise language used to describe cyber-security roles. Little is known about the effectiveness of these initiatives in markedly reducing the cyber-security workforce gap in a quantifiable way. More research is needed to understand which initiatives help reduce the gap in the cyber-security workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-international-cooperation-on-cyber-norm-development&quot;&gt;On International Cooperation on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All jurisdictions examined actively cooperate on cyber-norm development and seek to advance a free and secure cyberspace. They do so by supporting UN processes for norm development, by engaging in a range of multilateral, bilateral and multi-stakeholder arrangements, and by seeking greater cooperation on cyber (including on the development of cyber-security skills and closing the gap in the cyber workforce). More cooperation on skills development could further boost understanding of how to develop global solutions to a global problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological innovation and advancement continue to disrupt society at pace. While the economic benefits of breakthrough technologies are fairly clear, there are new cyber risks to infrastructure and data to consider. In light of these dynamics, countries are constantly designing, monitoring and refreshing their cyber -security policies, legislation and regulation to protect national security and the economic security and safety of organisations and their citizens. While some of the trends in cyber security are global, each jurisdiction’s approach to cyber policy and associated legislation and regulation follows its own themes and priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the content of cyber policies naturally varies, so do the mechanisms to implement them. Jurisdictions may prefer different types of levers to implement their cyber policies. Whereas one country may prefer to legislate heavily, others may advance cyber policies through standard-setting or non-binding policies. The approach a country chooses is shaped by a multitude of complex factors, including its political standpoint, constitutional structures, the cyber-threat landscape, the role of the private sector, and other socio-legal and historical factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding national and regional approaches to cyber policy is crucial, as these directly impact individuals and organisations operating within the respective jurisdictions. This paper allows policymakers and businesses to understand regulatory trends in several jurisdictions, providing them with up-to-date insights on how the regulatory landscape in these jurisdictions is evolving – and what that means for businesses and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide sets out to compare the approaches of six different jurisdictions – the UK, the EU, the US, Canada, Japan and Singapore – with regard to their respective cyber-policy agendas. The aim here is to improve understanding of the impact these policy agendas have on businesses and individuals working in these jurisdictions. This paper provides a valuable overview of different approaches to cyber policy by identifying trends in key legislative and regulatory initiatives over the past four years. A comparative section at the end of the paper puts these initial findings into perspective and identifies areas for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;research-questions&quot;&gt;Research Questions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper aims to provide an overview of different approaches to cyber-security policy. To narrow down the wide research area of cyber-security policy, the research underlying the paper focuses on four key research questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is the general background that shapes each jurisdiction’s approach to cyber policy?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the national priorities for developing cyber-resilience measures for critical national infrastructure (CNI)?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do the jurisdictions advance skills development and/or workforce regulation in the cyber context?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do these jurisdictions approach international cooperation on cyber regulation and how do they engage with other countries and entities, for example, in the context of norm-developing frameworks?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-and-scope&quot;&gt;Methodology and Scope&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research underlying this publication was primarily based on a review of existing literature. This involved the creation of search strings that were inputted into online repositories to identify sources. Google Scholar was the primary search engine used to find academic articles. Grey literature, including policy papers, was sourced through Bing and Google Search. From these initial sources, the research team identified further literature by examining article bibliographies and other references. Alongside these secondary sources, primary sources such as legislation, regulations and other official documents and government papers were also considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted from December 2022 to March 2023. Analysis of the gathered sourced material was based on a thematic approach, assessing sources’ provenance, arguments and conclusions in order to identify different approaches to cyber regulation in the EU and the five countries examined. The six jurisdictions studied – the UK, the EU, the US, Canada, Japan and Singapore – were chosen because they drive policymaking in cyber security and are leaders in the field, either as norm developers or because of their technology sectors. The research focused primarily on policies enacted or proposed between 2019 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this paper, the term ‘policy’ is used in a broad sense and encompasses binding (‘hard law’) as well as non-binding (‘soft law’) instruments or other policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper aims to provide policymakers with a guide on trends in recent cyber-security policy in various jurisdictions. It is therefore limited in scope and depth and serves as a starting point for future research. This means that reference can only be made to a selection of policies, regulations, or legislative activities, rather than listing them all. Nevertheless, the paper informs the reader about key issues and trends in the field, while keeping the level of detail appropriate for an initial overview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper comprises six chapters, each dedicated to the approach to cyber-security regulation taken by one of the jurisdictions. Each chapter begins by setting out the jurisdiction’s approach to cyber policy, regulation and legislation, structured around the four research questions listed above. After setting out the general context in which the approach to cyber-security policy must be seen, each chapter goes on to identify how the jurisdiction advances cyber-resilience measures for CNI. Then, each chapter examines how the jurisdiction approaches skills development and workforce regulation, before analysing the approach to international cooperation on cyber-norm development. After the individual chapters, the paper offers some general concluding remarks that make initial comparative observations based on the jurisdiction-level analysis, and points out further areas of research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uk&quot;&gt;The UK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is ‘a highly capable cyber state’ that follows an ambitious approach to cyber policy. This is reflected in its 2022 National Cyber Strategy, which advances a ‘whole of society approach’. Although largely in line with its 2016 Strategy, which shifted UK cyber policy toward binding regulation, the UK’s new strategy stresses a greater need for a holistic approach to cyber policy, as cyber issues relate to all areas of modern life. The ‘whole of society’ approach, as advanced in the UK cyber strategy, includes public–private partnerships and civil society, but also aspects such as ‘education strategy, industrial policy, work on regulations and incentives, and foreign policy’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new holistic approach also confirms the UK’s commitment to being a ‘cyber power’, a term used throughout the strategy, solidifying the UK’s strategic approach to cyberspace. It refers to the UK’s position advanced in the 2021 Integrated Review, which stresses the importance of responsible and democratic cyber power to achieving the UK’s national goals. On the whole, the UK’s strategy follows a ‘strategic and wide-ranging approach to cyber’. Next to the national cyber strategy, the UK also has a Government Cyber Security Strategy (2022–30) and a cyber-resilience strategy for the UK National Health Service (NHS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s strong position in the cyber field is supported by a wide range of public authorities working on cyber matters. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) stands out for conducting central – primarily technical – work on UK cyber security since its establishment in 2016, analysing and researching key cyber threats and risks. In 2020, the UK also confirmed the existence of its National Cyber Force, a unique body dedicated to offensive cyber operations. This agency sits between the intelligence agency GCHQ and the Ministry of Defence and ‘covers the full range of the UK’s national-security priorities’, including serious crime, terrorism and state threats. In 2023, the Department of Science, Innovation and Technology was formed, taking over tasks on cyber policy previously undertaken by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). Of primary relevance for the UK workforce is the UK Cyber Security Council, a self-regulatory body developing and promoting professional standards for the cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wide range of threats facing the UK was underlined in the NCSC’s 2022 Annual Review. These include ransomware attacks and other types of cybercrime, threats posed by state actors in cyberspace, and commercially available cyber tools. The UK also faces a significant gap in the cyber-security workforce, which increased further in 2022. The UK cyber strategy recognises this gap and signals an intention to expand the UK’s cyber skills and train, attract and diversify a growing cyber-security workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priorities-for-national-cyber-resilience-measures-for-cni&quot;&gt;Priorities for National Cyber-Resilience Measures for CNI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the priorities set out in the UK National Cyber Strategy is increasing the UK’s resilience. Confirming its whole-of-society approach, efforts to increase cyber resilience include (but are not limited to) improving the resilience of CNI. The UK government currently identifies 13 sectors as CNI, including civil nuclear, chemicals, food and health – education is not among the sectors listed. Given that a large percentage of UK CNI is owned by the private sector, close cooperation between the public and private sectors is required. The NCSC fosters such cooperation and provides a number of tools for guidance and advice for CNI businesses. It has also set up the ‘Industry 100’ initiative for further cooperation with industry partners. Furthermore, the 2023 Refresh of the UK’s Integrated Review announced a National Protective Security Authority, which ‘will engage with businesses and institutions to protect [the UK’s] security and prosperity at home’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the regulatory side, the UK has confirmed it will update its 2018 Security of Network &amp;amp; Information Systems Regulations (NIS Regulations). Results of the consultation process on the proposal for the updated NIS Regulations were published in November 2022, stating that the government aims to update this legislation ‘as soon as parliamentary time allows’. Given the updated EU regulations on NIS, such an update comes as no surprise, but could potentially mark one of the first areas of divergence post-Brexit. Businesses and their cyber-security staff operating in the EU and the UK which fall under the scope of both regulations will have to comply with two changing – but not necessarily identical – sets of requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the UK’s priorities for the updated NIS Regulations is to broaden the scope of their application, to include more businesses that will have to comply with the respective binding obligations, technology providers in particular. The regulations’ two-tier system, which imposes stricter requirements on essential service providers than on digital service providers, will remain. However, and arguably ‘long overlooked by the UK’s NIS Regulations’, managed service providers will be added as a new category of digital service providers that must comply with the regulations’ requirements. Although software companies are unlikely to be included, the illustrative list published by DCMS names IT outsourcing services, application management services, managed security operations centres and incident response services as managed IT services that will fall within the new scope of the NIS Regulations. As a result, these entities’ cyber workforces must comply with the new cyber-security obligations in the updated NIS Regulations. Furthermore, the updated regulations aim to improve the reporting of cyber incidents to regulators, likely expanding mandatory reporting to incidents ‘even if they don’t immediately cause disruption’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond CNI – and mirroring the EU’s proposal for a Cyber Resilience Act – the UK also passed the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act in December 2022. This entails obligations for companies that manufacture, import or distribute smart consumer products, further enhancing cyber resilience in the UK; however, these obligations have not yet come into force, as they require additional regulation. Such obligations may build upon the Code of Practice for Consumer IoT Security that the DCMS and NCSC developed in 2018. In addition, the UK government is advancing a Data Protection and Digital Information Bill, seeking to update the data protection laws previously based on the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, and to reduce paperwork for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-and-skills-development-and-regulation&quot;&gt;Workforce and Skills Development and Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to implement the regulatory updates outlined above and to enhance cyber resilience, the UK’s National Cyber Strategy recognises a need for developing a more ‘diverse and technically skilled workforce’. Improving diversity, in this context, goes beyond targeting the gender imbalance in the field, but also includes the need for greater regional diversity. London and the southeast of England employ nearly half of all UK cyber-security professionals. In response to this imbalance, the UK government has funded 12 ‘cyber clusters’. Located throughout all four home nations, these organisations are tasked with enhancing cooperation with the (local) private sector and civil society, but also with various public stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other government-backed initiatives for skills development include CyBOK (a programme setting up a body for collecting knowledge and making resources to develop cyber skills publicly available). Further initiatives under the NCSC’s CyberFirst programme for students include ‘Cyber Explorers’, a learning platform for young students, and the CyberFirst bursary scheme, offering undergraduate students £4,000 per year in financial assistance and cyber-security training to support their careers in cyber security. The UK Cyber Security Council has further established a cyber career framework, identifying 16 areas of specialism that provide practitioners with guidelines for career planning. In addition, the UK Cyber Security Council has taken over the (formerly NCSC-run) Certified Cyber Professional Scheme. The Council has also launched a pilot professional registration scheme for some of the 16 specialisms in cyber security at three registration titles: Associate; Principal; and Chartered. This pilot scheme will be extended to more specialisms throughout 2023. Such pilot projects can be seen as indicative of future developments in the professionalisation of the UK’s cyber workforce. This is also in line with a DCMS consultation on the professionalisation of the cyber workforce, which envisages professional standard-setting by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the UK arguably still faces a significant shortage in the cyber-security workforce, and a cyber-security skills gap, despite the fact that the government has launched a wide variety of initiatives. A similar assessment is made in a DCMS study, ‘Cybersecurity Skills in the UK Labour Market 2022’, which found that many organisations lack skills in areas such as setting up configured firewalls or detecting and removing malware. Other skills-development paths such as apprenticeships or skills transfers in later career stages could be better utilised to try to close the gap even more. Further research is thus necessary to better understand the effectiveness of existing initiatives for skills development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-interaction-on-cyber-norm-development&quot;&gt;International Interaction on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as advancing cyber policy on a domestic level, the UK also shapes international norm development in cyberspace. A 2022 ministerial document describes the UK as a ‘leading responsible and democratic cyber power’. The UK delivers on such ambitions by being actively involved in the UN norm-development processes, arguing in favour of norms of responsible cyber behaviour and the applicability of international law in cyberspace. The UK has also repeatedly argued in favour of a multi-stakeholder approach to cyberspace governance. Furthermore, the UK government emphasises the need for a stable, peaceful and secure cyberspace that maintains human-rights standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s international cooperation on cyber-norm development is primarily advanced through the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), which funds a number of initiatives for greater norm cooperation in cyberspace; this includes, for example, funding projects identifying responsible cyber behaviour. In addition, the UK actively supports and funds cyber capacity-building in cooperation with a range of jurisdictions, particularly Commonwealth countries. In 2021, an additional £22 million for cyber capacity-building in Africa and the Indo-Pacific was announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, the UK has cooperated with its allies with respect to sanctioning cyber-criminals, as well as with attributing malicious cyber operations to state actors. Finally, the UK has concluded a large number of bilateral agreements with other jurisdictions, setting out areas of cooperation in the cyber domain, including the US, the Netherlands, Australia and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-eu&quot;&gt;The EU&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context-1&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU is a well-established player in the field of cyber policy and actively shapes Europe’s approach to the regulation of cyber security. Economically powerful, the EU has also proven to be highly influential on cyber-security matters, and not just when it comes to data protection. The EU implements its vision for a free and secure cyberspace through a combination of different instruments, binding regulations, standard-setting directives and influential policies (including cyber diplomacy). Whereas the EU cyber-security policy in the 2010s was still largely seen as fragmented or ‘unsystematic’, many of the more recent efforts are working towards greater horizontal integration and harmonisation among EU member states. Four key activities have stood out in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the EU updated its cyber-security strategy in 2020 to mark the new digital decade. The updated strategy prioritises greater cyber resilience, especially for critical infrastructure, as well as increased cooperation and EU leadership on international norms and standards development. Activities in both areas are addressed in greater detail below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the role of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, has been strengthened by the 2019 Cybersecurity Act, giving the body a permanent mandate, as well as more tasks and resources. The EU Cybersecurity Act introduces an EU-wide cyber-security certification framework for ICT products, services and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the European Commission and the European External Action Service set out the EU’s new cyber defence policy in November 2022, which is ‘intended to strengthen European Cybersecurity capacity, boost military and civilian cooperation, close potential loopholes, reduce strategic dependencies and develop cyber skills’. This policy is primarily a response to deteriorating relations with Russia, and includes setting up an EU Cyber Defence Coordination Centre, as well as a network of military Computer Emergency Response Teams, an EU Cyber Commanders Conference and joint exercises. Similarly, the newly proposed Cyber Solidarity Act envisages the creation of a cyber emergency fund for incident response in the event of a large-scale cyber attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final noteworthy development is the proposal of the EU Cyber Resilience Act. The Commission’s proposal from September 2022 ‘aims to impose cybersecurity obligations on all products with digital elements whose intended and foreseeable use includes direct or indirect data connection to a device or network’. This includes cyber security by design as well as by default principles. The proposal is not yet in its final form, but is said to require businesses such as hardware manufacturers or software developers (as well as distributors and importers) to comply with ‘an “appropriate” level of cyber security, the prohibition [on selling] products with any known vulnerability, security by default configuration, protection from unauthorised access, limitation of attack surfaces, and minimisation of incident impact’. The Cyber Resilience Act is widely seen as a shift away from the EU’s sectoral approach to regulation, which imposes cyber-security regulations on specific products such as medical devices. Instead, the Cyber Resilience Act is intended to avoid both the fragmentation of market standards and duplication of obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priorities-for-national-cyber-resilience-measures-for-cni-1&quot;&gt;Priorities for National Cyber-Resilience Measures for CNI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protection and resilience of CNI are also a growing priority for EU policymakers. In order to be prepared to respond to the landscape of heightened threats in the contemporary geopolitical context, the EU is currently seeking to update its directive on critical infrastructure (from 2008) and intends new legislation to be in force in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new legislation will be complemented by existing directives, primarily the Directive on Resilience of Critical Infrastructure and the Revised Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS 2 Directive). The former was proposed by the Commission in 2020 to strengthen the resilience of critical entities that provide essential services in case of disruption, e.g., terrorist or other attacks. Member states are required to have a strategy for such events and to ‘carry out risk assessments’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updated in 2022, the NIS 2 Directive complements the Directive on Resilience of Critical Infrastructure by obliging the same CNI entities to follow cyber-resilience obligations. It has further expanded in scope and ‘now covers medium and large entities from more sectors that are critical for the economy and society’. The updated NIS 2 Directive imposes strengthened cyber-security requirements on companies, covers the security of supply chains and further ‘introduces accountability of top management for non-compliance with the cybersecurity obligations’ alongside stricter enforcement requirements, alignment of reporting obligations and supervisory measures for national authorities. The NIS 2 Directive came into force in January 2023, giving member states until October 2024 to incorporate the measures into national law. However, there can still be national differences in implementation, and businesses and cyber-security professionals may have to comply with varying obligations, depending on the country in which they operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obligations set out under the NIS 2 Directive, the Cyber Resilience Act and the Cyber Security Act increase cyber-security obligations and expand their application to a growing number of sectors and organisations. These obligations underline the need for cyber-security expertise and further require that businesses comply with new policies; this is likely to increase demand for more cyber professionals and more cyber expertise in related fields, e.g., in procurement or project management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-and-skills-development-and-regulation-1&quot;&gt;Workforce and Skills Development and Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To implement the increased obligations for cyber resilience set out in new and updated regulations, cyber-skills development is necessary, and the cyber workforce needs to be able to comply with these new measures. The lack of cyber-security skills in the European workforce has frequently been addressed in the literature. Not only is there a significant skills gap, which some studies find to be growing, but it is also increasingly difficult for companies to find and hire skilled cyber-security staff. Studies imply that the cyber-security labour market has been unable to match the steep rise in cybercrime and the high demand for cyber-security professionals in light of increasing digitalisation. Although skills and workforce development are dealt with by each individual member state, the EU is also responding to these issues, and has funded a wide range of initiatives in this sphere, particularly in terms of harmonising existing approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the European Commission launched four projects for cyber-security research, alongside training and education programmes, but their funding is now coming to an end. They were launched in preparation for the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre (ECCC), which is currently being developed. The ECCC will be located in Bucharest and will, together with national competence centres, develop ‘a common agenda for technology development’, including in businesses, especially SMEs. Furthermore, the European Commission has plans to set up a Cybersecurity Skills Academy with a potential launch date in the third quarter of 2023. This year, 2023, is also the European Year of Skills, prompting further initiatives to address the skills shortages among the EU workforce, including in cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with the EU’s other efforts to streamline its cyber-security policy, ENISA introduced the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF) in September 2022. As a ‘tool to build a common understanding of the cybersecurity professional role profiles’, the ECSF sets out 12 roles and their respective skills and responsibilities, for example, those of ‘cyber incident responder’, or ‘cybersecurity educator’. However, previous studies have indicated the need for further research on what policies are most effective in supporting a robust talent pipeline for cyber-security professionals. Alongside this Framework, ENISA has also created a Cybersecurity Higher Education Database, which lists cyber-security degrees from EEA countries and Switzerland. The database is intended as a point of reference for citizens wanting to upgrade their skills through further education and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-interaction-on-cyber-norm-development-1&quot;&gt;International Interaction on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its work on the close coordination of cyber policy within the EU, the EU is also active beyond the territory of its member states. The EU’s 2020 Cyber Strategy sets out to ensure an open and safe internet and for the EU to ‘step up its cooperation with partners around the world who share [its] values of democracy, rule of law and human rights’. The EU has done much to act upon these aims, with some even referring to it as a ‘norm superpower’. Indeed, the EU’s track record points towards the active role it has played in shaping the cyber-norm debate. On an international level, the EU has supported the UN processes on norm development, and also supports the proposal for a Programme of Action to Advance Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace as a permanent mechanism within the UN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the EU actively cooperates with other countries to strengthen their cyber security. This includes funding cyber-security measures in Eastern European countries such as Ukraine (e.g., to secure data exchanges or to protect critical infrastructure), as well as in Georgia. Together with the US, the EU plans to provide further cyber-capacity-building in Africa and the Indo-Pacific region. The EU has also funded EU CyberNet, a network of cyber-security experts and academics, to coordinate the EU’s external cyber-capacity-building projects (although this is coming to an end in 2023), as well as EU Cyber Direct, a think tank- and academia-led initiative in support of the EU’s cyber diplomacy, focusing on norm development and capacity-building programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2019, the European Council launched a sanctions regime which enables the EU to respond to (and deter) cyber attacks. This sanctions regime, which enables collective action by the EU and its member states, is part of the ‘EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox’, and it has since been extended until 2025. Potential measures include asset freezing and travel restrictions. Since its first use in 2020, the sanctions regime has been used on several subsequent occasions, for example, against the hackers who targeted the German Bundestag and those behind (inter alia) WannaCry and NotPetya. However, the attribution of cyber operations remains ‘a major challenge for EU cyber sanctions’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-us&quot;&gt;The US&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context-2&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has a strong record of advancing cyber-security policies that support an open, stable and secure cyberspace, and the country’s large private sector makes it a particularly powerful actor in the field. In March 2023, the Biden administration published a new National Cybersecurity Strategy, which is based on five key pillars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The defence of critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disruption and dismantling of threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shaping market forces to drive security and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investing in a resilient future (including through workforce development).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forging international partnerships to pursue shared goals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These key pillars will be referenced throughout this section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new cyber-security strategy marks a change in the US approach to cyber policy, in so far as it aims to increase regulatory oversight and paves the way for further federal cyber-security regulation. By advancing an increasingly coordinated approach to cyber-security regulation, the strategy seeks to impose further binding obligations on the private sector, meaning that hardware and software vendors will be increasingly responsible for implementing cyber-security standards. If implemented into law, the new strategy proposes that technology companies may be liable for failing to implement these standards. This new cyber-security strategy is, however, in line with a number of recent US cyber policies, for example, the regulations on cyber security for oil and gas pipelines that were introduced after the 2021 Colonial Pipeline hack. Similarly, President Biden has increased binding obligations on businesses when introducing mandatory reporting for CNI operators experiencing a significant cyber attack (such as a ransomware attack). The new cyber-security strategy is the result of increased cooperation with the private sector, and this cooperation will remain a key component going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new cyber-security strategy also intends to streamline US policy and to coordinate regulatory efforts. Previously, the Biden administration has often relied upon presidential interventions (for example, Executive Order 14028), but Congress has also advanced additional legislation on cyber-security issues. However, Congress can challenge or subsequently legislate contrary to an Executive Order. Similarly, in terms of the new cyber strategy, one risk is that party division in Congress could limit progress on implementing the strategy’s objectives. As a result, some think that the ‘strategy won’t have any regulatory teeth itself’. The following sections take a closer look at specific aspects of US cyber-security strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priorities for National Cyber-Resilience Measures for CNI One of the main pillars of the new US cyber-security strategy relates to defending CNI. In line with the broader shift towards top-down regulatory measures set out in the cyber-security strategy, a similar shift is proposed for measures protecting CNI. In light of significant threats facing the US, Anne Neuberger, deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, considers that previous ‘voluntary efforts have been insufficient’. The new strategy thus intends to enhance regulation by establishing new cyber-security requirements in ‘certain critical sectors’ and by requiring new authorities to set regulations in other sectors. Currently, only some of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors are subject to regulation. While five sectors (nuclear power, large energy generation, chemicals, financial services and major defence contractors) were subject to regulation prior to the Biden administration taking office, the Colonial Pipeline attack led to the regulation of further sectors, i.e., oil and gas pipelines, and aviation and railways. It is expected that the Environmental Protection Agency will also issue similar regulations for the water sector, leaving five sectors which are not subject to the oversight of an authority that has the competence to launch federal cyber regulation. Here, Congress could legislate to enhance further binding cyber-security standards for these sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protection of CNI is further advanced by the Cybersecurity &amp;amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), founded in 2018, which has recently published its first Strategic Plan (for 2023–25). It identifies four key priorities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leading ‘the national effort to ensure the defense and resilience of cyberspace’.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reducing risk to CNI, but also increasing its resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fostering whole-of-nation operational collaboration and information-sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking a unified approach as ‘[one] CISA through integrated functions, capabilities, and workforce’.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much of the US’s CNI is owned by the private sector, government cooperation with industry is particularly important. Relevant initiatives include CISA’s Automated Indicator Sharing Program, an early warning system enabling information-sharing between companies and public agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further cyber-security standards and best practices are also developed and shared by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which works closely with industry stakeholders and public agencies: for example, all federal agencies must implement its cyber-security standards. Although guidelines such as those developed under Executive Order 14028 on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity (May 2021) are primarily aimed at federal agencies, they can also be implemented by the private sector. One priority featured in the recent work of NIST is the protection of supply chains. NIST is currently working on updating its Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0). Initially aimed at CNI only, this framework is now used more widely, and has been updated using private and civil sector input. A draft of the new framework is expected by summer 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updated regulations and an increase in binding cyber-security obligations across an expanding number of sectors also means that companies are reliant on cyber-security professionals to implement such obligations. The cyber workforce in these areas must have the relevant skills to fulfil such tasks, both to comply with regulations and to uphold cyber security more generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-and-skills-development-and-regulation-2&quot;&gt;Workforce and Skills Development and Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obligation to comply with new cyber-security standards is linked to another key pillar of the new US cyber-security strategy – the investment in greater resilience. This pillar includes the aim of strengthening the cyber workforce and envisages the development of a National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy. Currently, the gap in the US cyber-security workforce is more than 410,000. A number of initiatives support efforts to fill this gap and improve skills development throughout the US; one noteworthy example of such efforts is the National Cyber Workforce and Education Summit that took place in July 2022, bringing together relevant stakeholders from the public and private sectors and from civil society. In this context, several further efforts were announced by multiple stakeholders, including a Cybersecurity Apprenticeship Sprint, which concluded in November 2022. The ‘sprint’ underlined a commitment to grow the adoption of apprenticeships as a pathway to employment in the US cyber-security workforce. The new cyber-security strategy also stresses the need for greater diversity, equity and inclusion in the cyber workforce. It thereby echoes previous efforts, such as a June 2021 Executive Order on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce. Several initiatives aim to increase such diversity, for example an internship programme seeking increased diversity in the New York City cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further examples of initiatives supporting cyber-security awareness and skills development in the US are manifold. For example, the US Security and Exchange Commission has proposed new rules that require board members of publicly traded companies to disclose their cyber expertise. CISA has also set up awareness campaigns to increase national public awareness and enhance levels of cyber-security understanding. CISA also supports a range of online training courses and has a dedicated National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS). The CyberSkills2Work initiative (2020) enables military veterans to transition into a career in cyber security. Other initiatives – primarily aimed at the younger generations – involve a range of cyber-security games and competitions. Meanwhile, individuals keen on advancing their cyber-security skills can consult the Cybersecurity Workforce Training Guide, which, together with the Cyber Career Pathways Tool, allows individuals to set out a training planin line with their skill level. Businesses that want to identify the extent of the cyber-security workforce within a specific area, or the costs associated with hiring additional cyber-security staff, can also consult the CyberSeek initiative, which provides information and an interactive map on job postings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the gap in the cyber-security workforce persists, despite this wide range of initiatives on skills development, meaning that further research is required to better understand the effectiveness of these initiatives. Here, the newly proposed National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy is intended to coordinate the US approach to developing a stronger and more diverse cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To harmonise the terminology used to describe the tasks and skills of cyber-security professionals, the US has adopted the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. This sets out categories of common cyber-security functions, specialist areas of cyber-security work, and work roles, providing detailed descriptions of the required knowledge, skills and abilities for each role. Although initially launched in 2012, the current (fourth) version includes several updates made in 2020. The NICE Framework was initially advanced as a national initiative but has since been influential in many other jurisdictions, including Canada and Japan, underlining that workforce development is a global issue. Despite the widespread influence of the Framework, recent research indicates that US employers still find that graduates of US higher education institutions lack the NICE foundation. The NICE Framework continues to be updated, including through public consultation on updated Framework data such as knowledge and skills statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-interaction-on-cyber-norm-development-2&quot;&gt;International Interaction on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond its national policies, the US is a leader in international norm development on cyber security and the regulation of cyberspace. It strongly lobbies for a free, secure and open internet, and envisages a multi-stakeholder approach to the governance of cyberspace. This is reflected in a wide range of activities and initiatives, including the US-led (but now finished) UN Governmental Group of Experts, for which it sponsored a resolution for renewal for 2019–21, as well as multiple initiatives and exercises conducted with NATO Allies. Together with a range of like-minded countries, in 2019, the US advanced a statement on responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, supporting the efforts of UN working groups. The US also became part of the Paris Call, a multi-stakeholder initiative led by France and Microsoft, in 2021, after initially being absent from the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional partnerships also allow the US to engage in ‘strategically-minded capacity building’, for example in cooperation with the African Union. Further partnerships such as the trilateral agreement AUKUS (with the UK and Australia) aim to strengthen cyber defence and resilience in the Indo-Pacific. Cyber security in the Indo-Pacific is further supported through the Quad, particularly in light of increased threats in this area stemming from China and North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US also indirectly advances norms through cooperation with other countries, for example when attributing cyber operations to states together with Five Eyes partners and others, or when imposing sanctions on cyber criminals (as was done more recently with the UK). In addition, a wide range of bilateral agreements further ensure US cooperation on cyber-security issues with like-minded jurisdictions such as Canada (on the protection of the shared energy infrastructure) and the UK (for a joint cyber academy). US cooperation with the EU is particularly noteworthy: after years of negotiations, the EU and the US recently agreed on a draft update for the EU–US data privacy framework, and in 2021 they set up the EU–US Trade and Technology Council for closer cooperation on digital transformation and technologies, based on shared values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to workforce development, the new US cyber-security strategy acknowledges that workforce development is a global issue. The strategy therefore seeks to enhance cooperation with other countries and to learn from their experience to further develop a skilled and diverse cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;canada&quot;&gt;Canada&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context-3&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada centres its cyber policy around its National Cyber Security Strategy, which was published in 2018. The core goals of this strategy were secure and resilient Canadian systems; an innovative and adaptive cyber ecosystem; and effective leadership, governance and collaboration. These goals remain valid, and an action plan guides their implementation. The 2021 mid-review of the strategy found that its targets were being met, including the establishment of the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, but that challenges persist ‘in meeting the growing demands for cyber talent’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cyber-threat landscape has expanded since the publication of Canada’s National Cyber Security Strategy. While Canada has highly developed cyber-security systems, it is also one of the most targeted countries, especially when it comes to cybercrime. The head of the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security wrote in 2022 that ‘Cybercrime is still the number one cyber threat activity affecting Canadians [and the] state-sponsored cyber programs of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea continue to pose the greatest strategic cyber threat to Canada’. Canada’s internet usage has increased since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, thereby also expanding the threat surface, both for individuals and for organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although they were not caused by cyber attacks, Canada experienced internet outages in 2021 and 2022 that demonstrated the vitalness of stable connectivity and the highly connected nature of critical infrastructure sectors. The increased risk to critical infrastructure was confirmed by the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security’s cyber-threat assessment for 2023–24. Threats include that posed by state-sponsored cyber operations; influence-seeking by cyber-threat actors that are ‘degrading trust in online spaces’; and ransomware attacks and other forms of cybercrime targeting Canadians and Canadian organisations. Canadian cyber policy focuses on adapting to this changing threat landscape and on tackling continuing issues, such as shortages of the cyber-security professionals necessary for ensuring resilience in the context of the morphing threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priorities-for-national-cyber-resilience-measures-for-cni-2&quot;&gt;Priorities for National Cyber-Resilience Measures for CNI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other jurisdictions discussed in this paper, Canada stresses the importance of increasing the resilience of its critical infrastructure. Canada defines its critical infrastructure as comprising 10 sectors. Canadian CNI has been subject to several significant cyber incidents, in particular the healthcare sector and local government. The National Cyber Threat Assessment 2023–2024 points out that critical infrastructure depends on its supply chains, making CNI especially vulnerable as attackers might first target a supplier to infiltrate or disrupt CNI. Despite deteriorating relations with Russia and China, however, Canada’s 2023–24 Cyber Threat Assessment concludes that ‘state-sponsored cyber threat actors will very likely refrain from intentionally disrupting or destroying Canadian critical infrastructure in the absence of direct hostilities’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further secure its CNI, Canada has ‘increased bilateral collaboration with the United States on critical energy infrastructure protection’. In June 2022, Canada introduced Bill C-26, which requires designated operators (i.e., those providing vital services, including in the energy, finance, transport and telecommunications sectors) to increase their cyber-security measures and to report attacks. If the bill becomes law, such measures will be enforceable by the authorities with the help of audit powers, fines and even criminal penalties. This legislation, if passed, would have a direct impact on private companies operating in Canada. If designated as operators under Bill C-26, companies will have to establish, maintain and review a cyber-security programme within 90 days, report incidents, comply with directions and maintain records of incidents and compliance. Implementing such suggested obligations will require a skilled cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s bill has been criticised as ‘potentially impair[ing] the ability of private companies to dispute demands, orders, or regulations that are issued by the government’ and for having ‘overly broad secrecy clauses’, raising concerns over transparency and accountability. Others see the mandatory reporting and information sharing between agencies as necessary steps to combat cybercrime, which in turn benefits both organisations and individuals. The bill recently finished its second reading in the Canadian House of Commons, and has yet to go to the Senate, and so it could still be amended over the course of the legislative procedure, but it could become law in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-and-skills-development-and-regulation-3&quot;&gt;Workforce and Skills Development and Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the other jurisdictions examined in this paper, the implementation of cyber-security obligations in Canada and the achievement of good cyber-security standards more generally there – in order to increase the country’s cyber resilience – requires a skilled cyber workforce. The shortage in Canada’s cyber-security workforce remains stable but considerable. Canada actively competes for the skilled workers it needs, particularly with the US. As US entities pay relatively higher salaries, the US is an attractive place of work for Canadians. While this leads to the risk of a ‘brain drain’ in the Canadian cyber-security sector, some commentators see lower Canadian wages as an opportunity for investors in the cyber-security sector. Within Canada itself the number of job postings among the different provinces varies considerably, with Ontario serving as the main hub of cyber-security-related jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to cyber workforce qualifications, Canada provides both formal cyber-security education (through universities) and a range of complementary options via online courses, coding bootcamps and certification schemes. Furthermore, the Future Skills Centre supports a number of initiatives aimed at diversifying Canada’s cyber-security workforce, for example the Canadian Cybersecurity Skills and Talent Transformation scheme, a joint project with Rogers Cybersecure Catalyst. Canada has also adopted a Cybersecurity Skills Framework, which largely overlaps with the established US Cyber Security Workforce Framework (NICE), but which focuses on the needs of the Canadian labour market and SMEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in 2022 the Canadian Chamber of Commerce – in cooperation with tech companies and civil society – demanded publicly that the government further prioritise the cyber-security sector, including bolstering the cyber-security workforce ‘by investing in cybersecurity education, talent development, retention and programs that diversify and expand the cyber workforce’. TECHNATION, a not-for-profit initiative representing Canadian technology companies, lists four main challenges for workforce development in Canada, including: the need to generate and retain cyber security talent; the need for technical and non-technical roles to gain sufficient knowledge, skills and abilities; and the need to normalise cyber security within the workplace. In addition, the Canadian workforce must be ‘responsive to the changing technology landscape’. In February 2023, the Canadian government announced additional support in the form of 250 million CAD for upskilling its workforce, including in the cyber-security profession, with the help of short-cycle upskilling programmes run in partnership with Palette Skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-interaction-on-cyber-norm-development-3&quot;&gt;International Interaction on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada has been an active partner for international cyber-norm development, for example when advocating for an open, secure and multi-stakeholder-led internet, and supporting the application of existing international law and norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace. Canada is not in favour of the conclusion of a new international law treaty on the regulation of cyberspace. Instead, in 2022, Canada published its interpretation of existing international law applicable to cyberspace, and has promoted the applicability of norms of responsible state behaviour in various forums, such as the G7, the G20 and NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its international cooperation on cyber policy, Canada is focused in particular on ‘help[ing] other countries expand their capacity building activities’, which has been ‘a key aspect of Canada’s cyber engagement strategy’. This commitment is demonstrated in a number of initiatives, focusing largely on Latin America, the Caribbean and Southeast Asia. For example, Canada has contributed significantly to cyber capacity-building, especially in Latin America, by allocating funds to the Anti-Crime Capacity Building Program. Similarly, Canada works with the Inter-American Committee against Terrorism to improve participation in UN processes on cybercrime and cyber-security negotiations. Within the Organisation of American States, Canada also funded a project (as of 2022) to support other member states in targeting and understanding the implications of the gender gap in the cyber-security workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cooperation with other allies, especially the Five Eyes community, Canada has repeatedly attributed malicious cyber activities to other states. It has also funded projects related to how attribution can be made. Attribution is critical, as it helps to hold malicious actors accountable, and is in line with Canada’s increasingly active role in this and other related areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japan&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context-4&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Japan, the award of the 2020 Olympic Games prompted a significant increase in cyber-security awareness. Aiming to protect the 2020 Olympic Summer Games from cyber attacks, the Japanese government launched widespread campaigns to build up cyber resilience (including in the private sector) and to educate the workforce. The Olympics thus arguably served as a springboard for further raising cyber-security standards in the Japanese private sector. This aim was also reflected in the country’s 2018 Cyber Security Strategy (for 2018–21), which focused primarily on the Olympic and Paralympic Games, recognising ‘the potential cyber threat from hostile states’, and referring on its first page to the growing danger of ‘organised, sophisticated, and possibly state-sponsored’ cyber attacks. Japan’s cyber-security strategy thus focuses on protecting critical infrastructure, on stakeholder cooperation, and on the improvement of cyber security in the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these approaches were widely considered to have been successful in protecting the (Covid-19-delayed) Olympic Games, the priorities outlined above remain highly relevant in 2023. However, Japan’s approach to cyber security changed significantly in 2022, in light of an increasing number of cyber attacks against the country, and in particular given the deteriorating relationships with China and Russia. While still in the process of determining a cyber-security budget for 2024, Japan announced a significant change in its cyber strategy, including the adoption of an active cyber defence. Japan had previously alluded to deterrence capabilities in its 2018 strategy, but the recent shift is significant. Some even consider it to be a ‘turning point’ for Japan’s defence policy, which is traditionally limited by Japan’s pacifist constitution (as well as by privacy considerations). This recent shift constitutes an atypical, proactive approach, which is considered necessary to ‘actively pre-empt and stop attacks before they reach Japan’s systems’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Japan primarily pursues a top-down approach when advancing cyber-security measures domestically, relying predominantly on ‘government regulators to establish cyber-security requirements’. Japanese cyber-security policy includes key areas such as the protection of national infrastructure and the development of the cyber workforce, which will be addressed in more detail in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priorities-for-national-cyber-resilience-measures-for-cni-3&quot;&gt;Priorities for National Cyber-Resilience Measures for CNI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the key issues in Japanese cyber policy are the protection of critical infrastructure and improving the resilience of supply chains, as well as wider cyber-security awareness, particularly in the private sector. While ‘Japan remains a world leader in cyberspace technologies’, its own cyber-security standards have raised concerns in the past, for example in the US, which has criticised Japan’s weak cyber-security practices and has considered these to be a barrier to deeper cooperation and intelligence sharing. Yet the US and Japan have been working to overcome these differences through bilateral talks, including signing a Memorandum of Cooperation on Cybersecurity in January 2023 to strengthen the collaboration between the two countries in the area of cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s CNI is primarily owned by the private sector. The Basic Cyber Security Act entails duties for operators of critical infrastructure businesses, a group that has expanded in recent years, and which now includes 14 sectors. However, these obligations are often vague, for example when requiring that CNI providers ‘deepen [their] interest in and understanding of the importance of cybersecurity’, and information-sharing on cyber incidents remains limited, for cultural and structural reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an updated action plan from June 2022, the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) offers guidance for safety standards and information-sharing systems to further improve cyber-security standards in Japan. The plan, which is only available in Japanese, further recommends that businesses develop risk-management procedures, and sets out specific requirements to be met by CNI businesses and staff, including Chief Information Security Officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Japan passed an economic security bill in May 2022 that provides greater protection for supply chains and infrastructure with regard to cyber attacks. More specifically, it imposes obligations on companies in critical infrastructure sectors to inform the government of software updates and to ‘vet some equipment procurement’. The private sector requires a skilled workforce to implement these obligations and to raise cyber-security awareness and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond these measures, Japan continues to strengthen its strategic partnership with the US on cyber cooperation to ensure greater resilience, particularly if confronted with hostile actions by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-and-skills-development-and-regulation-4&quot;&gt;Workforce and Skills Development and Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other jurisdictions dealt with in this paper, Japan is experiencing shortages in the cyber-security workforce, and overall cyber-security awareness is arguably relatively low in Japan. This situation is augmented as many Japanese companies outsource their IT and cyber-security work, resulting in smaller in-house teams compared with other countries. Furthermore, Japanese work culture traditionally foresees a high rate of job rotation, which comes at the cost of acquiring specialised cyber-security skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To respond to these skill shortages, the Japanese government has supported cyber-security skills development, for example by inaugurating the National Cyber Training Center (NICT), which offers training courses, especially for under-25s, and the Industrial Cyber Security Center of Excellence for training for mid-career and senior professionals. The NICT established a training programme, Cyber Colosseo, in advance of the Olympic Games, and also holds CYDER defence exercises, particularly for government officials and CNI businesses. However, information in English remains limited. To establish a common language for cyber-security skills, Japan has previously adopted the US NICE workforce framework, a choice made attractive by the fact that many Japanese companies outsource their IT outside Japan, and require an international understanding of what cyber-security talents are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals qualified in this area are thus in high demand in Japan and have good job opportunities. One IT recruitment agency reports that qualifications such as (ISC)²’s Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) are considered useful; that there is an increased demand for cloud engineers, such as Amazon Web Services engineers; and that demand is particularly high for personnel related to public cloud services such as SaaS and IaaS. The Japanese Ministry of Defense is also increasing its role as an employer of cyber-security workers, and has plans to increase cyber-defence personnel, aiming to expand today’s 800 staff members to 5,000 by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An initiative involving academia, government and the private sector founded the Cross-Sector Forum (2015) ‘to build an ecosystem to educate, recruit, retain, and train cybersecurity talent’ in Japan. The Forum has been active in advancing definitions of relevant talents and skills, and has created guidelines and provided funding for universities for cyber-security courses on which staff members of consortium partners can teach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-interaction-on-cyber-norm-development-4&quot;&gt;International Interaction on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside these domestic policy considerations focused on increasing resilience and workforce development, Japan undertakes cyber-security diplomacy based on three main principles: the promotion of the rule of law; cooperation on capacity building; and the development of confidence-building measures. Japan has also contributed to discussions on norm development in cyberspace, for example by participating in several rounds of UN expert group discussions on cyber norms; and, in 2021, it made a public statement on its interpretation of international law in cyberspace in the UN forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to norm development, Japan has stressed a preference for voluntary and non-binding norms on responsible state behaviour in cyberspace (as identified by the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) report in 2015), and has voiced caution, both about extending these norms and about what it sees as the risk of prematurely debating a binding new treaty. Japan is a member of the Budapest Convention against Cybercrime and, as of 2022, had joined NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. The country is also a regular participant in the ASEAN Regional Forum’s efforts on cyber issues and participates in the G7 Cyber Expert Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan also supports a number of capacity-building initiatives. These are coordinated by the NISC and focus primarily on ASEAN states. They include the annual ASEAN–Japan Cybersecurity Policy meeting and related working groups and activities. Since 2018, Japan has funded the ASEAN–Japan Cybersecurity Capacity Building Centre, which supports talent development for the region’s cyber-security workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has a range of bilateral agreements to strengthen technology and cyber cooperation with other countries, for example with the US and the UK. With respect to the latter, both nations are currently seeking to ‘make it easier for businesses to operate in both countries by aligning approaches to digital regulation’; to improve cyber resilience; and to ‘promote initiatives to standardise the security of internet-connected products and apps’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;singapore&quot;&gt;Singapore&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context-5&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore is a highly digitalised city state with advanced cyber-security regulation and policies. But as ‘the cyber ecosystem in Singapore is expanding rapidly’, Singapore has also experienced a high number of cyber attacks in recent years, for example in the form of ‘SMS-phishing scams targeting bank customers’. One study finds that 65% of organisations in Singapore were hit by ransomware attacks in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To respond to the changing threat landscape and boost cyber resilience, Singapore updated its cyber-security strategy in 2021. This now rests on three strategic pillars: building resilient infrastructure; enabling a safer cyberspace; and enhancing international cyber cooperation. In addition, the strategy identifies two foundational enablers: developing a vibrant cyber-security ecosystem; and growing a robust talent pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these priorities in mind, Singapore’s strategy is that of a nation that ‘has long set its sights on becoming a world-class, tech-driven city-state’ and which, as a consequence, considers cyber security to be a matter of national security. As regulation remains critical to supporting cyber resilience, Singapore’s government ‘explore[s] expanding the government’s regulatory remit’ under the updated cyber-security act, for example, to further expand regulation beyond CNI businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Singapore has launched multiple initiatives and projects in coordination with other countries and the private sector that seek to enhance cyber resilience and to educate and cultivate a much-needed IT workforce. One way the government seeks private sector engagement is through the Cybersecurity Industry Call for Innovation 2022, in which the government invites cyber-security businesses to join the effort to identify and develop ‘innovative solutions to address specific cybersecurity challenges’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priorities-for-national-cyber-resilience-measures-for-cni-4&quot;&gt;Priorities for National Cyber-Resilience Measures for CNI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As outlined in its cyber-security strategy, building a resilient infrastructure is a key pillar of Singapore’s cyber policy. To further enhance cyber-resilience measures for Critical Information Structure (CII), that is, any ‘computer or computer system located wholly or partly in Singapore’ that is ‘necessary for the continuous delivery of an essential service’, Singapore’s Cyber Security Agency (CSA) has launched a supply chain programme. This comes in the context of the increasingly complex threat landscape, but also in response to advanced digitalisation in the post-pandemic environment. The programme sets out five initiatives, including a toolkit, a handbook, a certification scheme and a learning hub, designed to support businesses in the sector, as well as a platform for international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A complementary code of practice (CCoP 2.0) sets out measures and standards that businesses in the respective CII sectors must implement. The second edition of these standards of performance came into force in July 2022 and ‘specifies the minimum requirements’ that businesses in these sectors must adhere to. Companies can, however, request waivers of requirements for valid reasons. The CCoP further provides, among other things, incident response plans, and sets out design principles for cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These increased cyber-security obligations have to be implemented by businesses and the cyber workforce. However, this can prove challenging, for example with respect to the CII supply chain guide, which some have perceived as offering limited concrete points for companies to implement, for instance in case of a supply chain attack or to prevent supply chain risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-and-skills-development-and-regulation-5&quot;&gt;Workforce and Skills Development and Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to other jurisdictions examined in this paper, Singapore’s shortage in the cyber-security workforce lessened significantly in 2022. As it is Singapore’s ambition to be a world leader in all things cyber, the government of Singapore has introduced a broad set of measures to attract highly skilled workers, including those in the IT sector. Alongside five-year visas and visa programmes such as the TechPass, Singapore has an advanced digital infrastructure, ensuring that it is an attractive place to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even where favourable conditions and the right regulations are in place, ‘digital transformation will remain but a vision without the right talent to execute it’, according to Senior Minister of State Tan Kiat How. To secure such talent, further initiatives like the TechSkills Accelerator create links between students from education institutions such as the Singapore Institute of Technology and private sector companies, for example in the form of internship programmes. At the same time, there have been calls for companies to engage in more skills-based assessments, rather than relying on formal academic qualifications during hiring processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with Singapore’s preference for regulation of the cyber-security sector, businesses providing cyber-security services and operating in Singapore are also subject to several regulatory frameworks. For example, where businesses offer penetration testing or managed security operations centre monitoring services, as of 2022, they are required to obtain a licence. Such measures, which could still be extended to other cyber-security services, are intended to protect consumer interests as well as to ‘improve service providers’ standards and standing over time’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore’s CSA has also initiated a certification scheme that recognises businesses that have ‘adopted and implemented good cybersecurity practices’. More concretely, SMEs can achieve the CSA’s ‘Cyber Essentials’ standard, which recognises good cyber-hygiene practices. For larger and international corporations, the CSA launched the ‘Cyber Trust’ mark, which recognises ‘comprehensive measures and practices’. The CSA’s CEO, David Koh, sees the certification system as a means for companies to demonstrate their commitment ‘to ensure that they remain cyber-secure, giving them an edge over their competitors’ while simultaneously ‘providing greater assurance to their customers’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-interaction-on-cyber-norm-development-5&quot;&gt;International Interaction on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the strategic pillars of Singapore’s 2021 cyber-security strategy aims to enhance international cyber cooperation to ‘foster an open, secure, stable, accessible, peaceful, and interoperable cyberspace’. Singapore is already proactively engaging in a wide range of initiatives fostering international cooperation on cyber matters. For example, Singapore has been an active participant in UN norm processes, including the UN’s GGE and the Open-Ended Working Group, where Singapore has called for a ‘UN cyber fellowship program for small states that would support the training in cyber issues for mid- to senior level officials from smaller developing countries’. Furthermore, Singapore co-chairs, with Estonia, the UN Group on e-governance and cybersecurity, and chairs the UN Group of Friends on Digital Technologies, in cooperation with Finland and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore hosts the annual Singapore International Cyber Week, a high-level event on cyber security fostering cooperation in the field, including on norm implementation. Singapore has also been active in regional capacity building, for example when it announced in 2019 that it would provide around $22 million for the establishment of the ASEAN–Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence which, among other things, trains computer emergency response teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further support these ambitions, Singapore has multiple bilateral agreements with countries such as Australia, Japan, France, Germany, the UK and the US, all working on improving cyber capabilities in Southeast Asia. In late 2022, the Inaugural US–Singapore Cyber Dialogue was held, providing a platform of exchange for officials to discuss both further cooperation and topics such as supply-chain security, cyber capacity building, and cyber talent and workforce development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concluding-remarks&quot;&gt;Concluding Remarks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following concluding remarks set out initial comparative observations based on the research underlying this paper, and point to areas that require further research to better understand the various regulatory approaches to cyber-security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the jurisdictions discussed in this paper have advanced a cyber strategy. While these strategies certainly take into account the cyber threat landscape and wider global contexts, aspects of the strategies remain specific to each jurisdiction (such as the Olympic Games in Japan). However, some common themes can be observed across the strategies:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Strategies are regularly updated in line with domestic timelines, but they also respond to international events. In the timeframe examined for this paper, recent trends include the rise of cybercrime, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, heightened tensions between China and Taiwan, and the increased need to secure CNI and supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These strategy updates increasingly focus on harmonising and streamlining each jurisdiction’s existing and developing cyber policies. Such harmonisation is advanced to avoid both fragmentation and the duplication of effort. This is reflected in the UK’s 2022 strategy and its ‘whole of society’ approach, and in the EU’s efforts to move away from a sectoral approach towards a more cohesive cyber policy, including the development of a skilled cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There is a noticeable trend towards interventionist policies that emphasise regulatory approaches to cyber security, rather than voluntary standards. This trend was already apparent in the UK’s 2016 cyber strategy, and is now also reflected in the US’s 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy. In line with this trend, businesses and cyber-security professionals must anticipate regulatory changes if they are to keep up with varying and increasingly binding obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greater protection of CNI is a priority for all the jurisdictions discussed in this paper. Although the number and scope of sectors categorised as CNI varies from one jurisdiction to another, many of the designated sectors are common. Further efforts to advance mandatory cyber-security measures beyond CNI sectors is also a priority for many jurisdictions, which again has a direct impact on businesses and the cyber-security professionals who have to implement them. Thus businesses and cyber-security professionals have to simultaneously comply with changing and at times varying obligations among different jurisdictions – particularly if they operate internationally. Further research comparing and contrasting the varying scope of CNI designations and the respective cyber-security obligations for businesses and cyber-security professionals could help clarify ways for them to navigate the different requirements, and identify the skills required from the workforce where businesses operate across a range of jurisdictions. Further research could also explore opportunities and approaches for harmonising the range of frameworks, policies, initiatives and changing regulations that currently exist.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although often a whole range of tools, frameworks and initiatives improving public–private partnerships are available to guide businesses in implementing these measures, it is not always clear what these obligations entail in detail. This is especially true for non-binding or vague standards. Although much information is available in English, where this is not the case it is especially challenging for external businesses and cyber-security professionals to understand how to comply with these obligations. Again, further comparative research would help businesses and cyber-security professionals understand the practical impact of changing regulations, new cyber-security measures and – especially – the varying obligations they must comply with, such as reporting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common theme seen across all the jurisdictions examined is the shortage of personnel in the cyber-security workforce, exacerbated by global events and trends, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and increased digitalisation. In fact, many of the jurisdictions outlined here compete directly with each other for skilled workers (for example, the US and Canada) or rely heavily on outside cyber expertise (as is the case for Japan). Governments have responded to such shortages by acknowledging the need to improve skills development through a range of initiatives. Many of the measures in place across the different jurisdictions resemble one another, especially where they focus on attracting young people to cyber-security professions, or involve adopting skills frameworks such as NICE or the ECSF to harmonise the language used to describe cyber-security roles. Some jurisdictions prioritise specific aspects in their efforts to support a robust talent pipeline, for example when aiming for greater diversity with respect to gender (Canada, the US) and region (the UK). However, despite the multitude of initiatives fostering skills development, little is known about their effectiveness. More research is needed to understand which initiatives help eliminate discrepancies between education and the demands of industry and, as a result, reduce the gaps in the cyber-security workforce. Singapore would make an interesting case study, providing further insights into the effectiveness of measures taken in 2022, when the city state was successful in reducing its gap in the cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, the jurisdictions studied in this paper share a cooperative, proactive attitude to the development of norms applicable to cyberspace, and seek to advance a free and secure internet. All entities covered are active supporters of the UN processes for norm development in cyberspace and engage in a range of multilateral, bilateral and multi-stakeholder arrangements, seeking greater cooperation on cyber issues with other states, regional organisations, and the private sector. Areas for cooperation include norm development and capacity building, but also the development of cyber-security skills and closing the gap in the cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qgyvLtN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（25日）踏入審訊第50天，趙家賢繼續接受盤問。鄒家成一方指「本土抗爭派」中的「抗爭」不代表反建制或反政府，只是會更願意更積極主動地爭取政治目標，趙不同意，指傳統民主派亦有很多人很進取「chur 住」政府官員，屬很溫和的方法。他亦確認不清楚新界東有否就運用否決權達成共識，惟指戴耀廷原本打算參選人報名時就協議有「實體簽名」，若非有共識不可能召開初選記者會，否則公開後有人不同意會有「反彈」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙盤問下亦同意，參選超級區議會的李予信是「溫和、務實、新晉」的傳統民主派，亦同意超區界別是2012年政府與民主黨政治妥協的產物。趙指「妥協係政治嘅藝術」，他當年任民主黨中央委員時，亦支持黨友投票通過政府的政改方案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指新東第二次會議無進行過投票-趙不同意&quot;&gt;辯方指新東第二次會議無進行過投票 趙不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢繼續接受代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑盤問，根攄黎敬輝就5月5日第二次新東會議的筆記，寫有「『會運用』 - 投票通過」。趙同意當時嘗試向黎敬輝了解情況，指相信民主黨代表李永成無獲授權表態，而黎則引戴耀廷指「份協議要去出最後版本」，望以表決形式「畀一個主流嘅大方向出嚟」。趙其後再找戴，指民主黨代表應不獲授權投票，對結果感詫異，戴則回應會採用大方向起草最終協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑問，戴是否沒告訴他曾舉行投票並通過決議？趙重申是非正式的意向性投票，戴是望以此拿到「大方向」。李運騰追問，不論正式或非正式，戴有否確認曾進行投票？趙稱「係有一個投票」。陳世傑最終指出，事實上第二次會議沒有進行投票，亦沒有進行意向性投票，趙不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意不清楚就運用否決權有否達成共識-指戴耀廷清楚民主黨有保留&quot;&gt;趙同意不清楚就運用否決權有否達成共識 指戴耀廷清楚民主黨有保留&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，戴耀廷原本打算要求參選人簽署協議，但在6月9日記者會稱毋須簽署，而戴在他要求下，於6月8日在組織者群組發出各區協議的最後版本，他並稱之為各區共識。趙同意不知道協議如何產生，「戴耀廷冇特別同我講」，而他稱之為「共識」是因為戴這樣告訴他。他亦同意新東第二次會議至6月8日之間，不曾有其他新東會議，被問是否知道就運用否決權的條款有達成共識，趙答「我唔清楚」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續指，事實上會上就否決權有不同意見，但戴耀廷則自行（took upon）決定同意了的內容，並引趙早前曾同意法官陳慶偉指，民主陣營光譜很闊，如在否決財政預算案上社民連和本土抗爭派意見不同，最終部分選區同意使用「會運用」否決權，即使有參與者未必完全同意，但戴還是做了決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續引黎敬輝筆記，指戴會上曾提及「會議共識是較多數人的認同，接納可接受的方案」，指與趙說法相符。趙同意，並指辯方遺漏了他會後曾向戴提出民主黨有關注和顧慮，而戴稱會與民主黨或對否決預算案有顧慮的人作處理，又重申戴會駕車周圍與不同參選人溝通接觸。陳仲衡問，故戴耀廷清楚知道民主黨有保留？趙同意，指「我同佢嘅溝通當中，佢係清楚知道，所以佢同我承諾話佢會跟進」，而他亦接受了戴的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指若非有共識戴不可能召記者會-否則會有反彈&quot;&gt;趙指若非有共識戴不可能召記者會 否則會有反彈&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，辯方是向趙指出，事實上沒有大家同意的協議，而是由戴耀廷決定協議內容。趙回應就當時情況而言，若戴並非確認到參與的持分者是同意，又或是在該氣氛下受壓力同意，惟陳慶偉打斷問是指哪個時間點，問是否指6月9日記者會。趙同意並語氣急促指，若戴「唔係喺5月5日至6月9日中間確認好有共識係處理好嘅話，佢唔可能係同意然後叫我去準備個記者會去講出嚟，因為公開咗嘅話，如果有人唔同意就會即刻反彈㗎嘛」，並指原本的構思，是想每個參與者報名時都有「實體簽名」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，即趙是指根據原本計劃，候選人需簽署協議，故若事實上沒有共識，而戴又自行決定，便會引起候選人的爭論？趙同意。陳世傑續指，在5個地方選區中，只有兩個區作出回應並簽署文件，陳慶偉補充即附上共同綱領。趙略為激動以雙手比劃，並大聲說：「抱歉我答唔到，個事實情況唔係咁樣，即係你將幾樣嘢痴埋一齊嚟講嘅」，鄒家成發笑。李運騰指問題很簡單，即是否只有兩區參選人報名時附上共同綱領，趙冷靜下來表示同意，指該份共同綱領「係佢哋各自區自己攞咗戴耀廷份嘢嘅一啲元素擺落去整出嚟嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續展示組織者群組 WhatsApp 紀錄，趙家賢6月19日曾稱「區軒同埋 Benny 係有白紙黑字 circulate 畀大家確認，雖然冇最後簽紙，但係呢個都係一個 mutually agreed consents（互相同意的協議）」，趙在李詢問下，指「我當時係真誠地確信」有互相同意的協議，並重申是指戴在6月8日發出的協議最後版本。李再問趙是否相信戴有將協議傳給所有人？趙指因戴曾說過會傳閱通知予有關參選人，他亦有看到戴使用廣播功能，加上他曾問一兩個參與協調者，他們均反映有透過廣播收到該文件，故當時真誠確信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙不同意抗爭一詞只是代表更積極主動傳統民主派好多人都-chur-住政府官員&quot;&gt;趙不同意「抗爭」一詞只是代表更積極主動：傳統民主派好多人都 chur 住政府官員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑其後問到「本土抗爭派」的意思，問趙是否同意「本土抗爭派」是形容較年輕、並以港人利益為先的本土政治人物，趙表示「部分同意，因為呢個只係最基本嘅一啲元素」，在延伸庭的黃之鋒發笑。陳再指，當中「抗爭」一詞不是代表他們反建制或反政府，只是他們更願意更積極主動地（proactively）爭取政治目標，趙不同意，並指「傳統民主派裡面都有好多人就住政策嗰方面，係好進取去 chur 住啲政府官員要起啲地區建設等等，你頭先講嘅係一個好溫和嘅方法之一」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，「本土抗爭派」包含不同人士，有些可能很反政府，有些則不是，因此很難給予整體答案，或者辯方可指出他們「不一定（not necessarily）」是這樣。法官陳慶偉則認為，如辯方希望，可直接向證人指出鄒家成很溫和，又或他是激進但不反政府。陳世傑一度指，鄒家成可能很主動發聲，但不一定是非法，但陳慶偉指兩者沒有關係，李運騰亦強調本案不是取決於被告屬於什麼陣營，陳世傑續指已完成盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指超區是政府與民主黨妥協產物-趙妥協係政治嘅藝術&quot;&gt;辯方指「超區」是政府與民主黨妥協產物 趙：妥協係政治嘅藝術&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;柯耀林沒有盤問，代表李予信的大律師關文渭接着盤問。李予信參選區議會（第二）功能界別（超級區議會），關問「超區」的界別是否2012年時，政府與民主黨政治妥協（compromise）的產物，法官陳仲衡一度質疑他在問證人的意見，但關稱趙當時有份參與，陳慶偉批准發問。趙續回答：「係，妥協係政治嘅藝術」，並指自己當時是民主黨的中央委員，「喺2010年嘅政改方案，我都支持民主黨嘅立法會議員投票通過當時政府嘅政改方案」，他亦同意因此導致超區出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指超區選民為草根階層-法官我是草根階層嗎&quot;&gt;辯方指超區選民為草根階層 法官：我是草根階層嗎？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關續指，有兩個條件可成為此界別的選民，首先他並非其他功能界別選民，第二是他沒有取消登記超區的界別，趙同意。陳慶偉問即選民若沒有取消登記，會自動成為超區的選民？關同意，李運騰並一度指法官並非任何功能組別的選民，但不記得曾被要求取消登記，關指李可能忘記了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後法官與辯方就選民資格討論，關表示超區與其他功能組別有別，並非代表商界等利益，而超區選民主要是「草根階層（grassroot citizens）」，這時李運騰表示：「我也是區議會（第二）的選民，我是草根階層嗎？（“I am also voter of DC2, did I consdier myself as grassroot?”）」，陳慶偉亦指他曾經是衞生服務界的選民，多人發笑。關其後問，這些一般市民並非由其他特定界別代表？趙表示：「呢方面我比較熟悉，或者我講解清楚」，但陳慶偉即擺手打斷稱：「我們已經明白」，多人大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意李予信是溫和務實新晉的傳統民主派&quot;&gt;趙同意李予信是「溫和、務實、新晉」的傳統民主派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙其後確認，於2020年與李予信為東區區議會的同事，當時趙為副主席，李則是成員，當時政府會就建設項目提出臨時撥款。關續問，李予信是否經常會對撥款投贊成票，並舉例指北角糖水道需150萬進行拆除天橋的工程，而該筆撥款需區議會通過。趙未回答，陳慶偉便指區議會只是諮詢機構（consultative body），不認為政府須獲區議會允許（permission），提醒辯方注意用詞。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 李予信&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關改問，政府在地區建設前，要尋求區議會同意？趙同意並指：「因為好多地區部門都好重視區議會意見，唔單止工作、交通、一啲規劃，全部係透過地區部門、透過區議會去攞意見，有啲做法當然希望區議會能夠通過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，關問到趙有否私下跟李就2015年政府政改失敗等議題討論，趙稱應該有。被問到會否視李為溫和、務實的新晉民主派，趙表示李是「溫和、務實、新晉嘅傳統民主派」。李聞言微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭表示完成盤問。由於昨日趙家賢就鄭達鴻及彭卓棋早前的盤問作補充，代表鄭的大律師黃宇逸表示可能會再有盤問，陳慶偉今指，法庭考慮後決定批准黃及代表彭的大律師盧敏儀發問，但兩人最後表示沒有問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（25日）踏入審訊第50天。前民主動力召集人趙家賢接受主問及盤問共17天，今作供完畢，料下一名控方證人為同案認罪被告、民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟。控方午休前表示，上周六（22日）始破解鍾錦麟電話，需時處理披露資料事宜。法官李運騰指情況非常不理想，指電話一直由警方保管，為何審訊第50天仍要處理此基本程序，又問控方是否未獲鍾合作。控方下午解釋，由於鍾不肯定電話密碼，警方為免資料被刪而沒有冒險嘗試，並因科技進步於上周六始成功破解。控方不會依賴當中逾2,400則訊息，辯方則需時審視，案件押後至明天繼續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指上周六始破解鍾錦麟電話需時考慮披露資料-法官指非常不理想&quot;&gt;控方指上周六始破解鍾錦麟電話、需時考慮披露資料 法官指非常不理想&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;所有被告今早完成盤問趙家賢，並由主控萬德豪進行覆問。萬覆問完成後指預計會傳召另一認罪被告鍾錦麟，惟有事情需於午飯時處理。在趙離開後，萬解釋警方於上周六破解了鍾的電話，並考慮披露當中某些資料。李運騰問因此控方需在傳證人前考慮披露的問題？萬同意，並要檢視控方會否依賴當中的材料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰嘆氣，問電話一直是由警方抑或鍾錦麟保管？萬答是由警方保管。李指情況非常不理想，指現時已是審訊第50天，為何控方此前沒有檢視，又指控方在開審前檢視手提電話是很基本，問能否於今天之內處理好。萬指很有可能，並指可解釋為什麼要檢視該些材料，李運騰打斷指，「我認為你欠所有人一個解釋。（“I think you owe everybody an explanation of this.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱科技進步才能破解-官質疑是否未獲證人合作&quot;&gt;控方稱「科技進步」才能破解 官質疑是否未獲證人合作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續指，因為科技的進步（advancement of technology），他們現時能破解鍾的電話。李問，所以控方此前未能解鎖鍾的電話，即控方未能獲得鍾錦麟的合作？並指若鍾不願提供密碼，辯方或會關注為何控方未能得到鍾的全盤合作。萬德豪指會於午飯後回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/c4EGgIb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鍾錦麟（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就案件的進度，李運騰指鍾錦麟所需時間應沒有首兩名證人般長，並問第四名證人是誰。萬德豪指還會有專家證人及與證物鏈相關的證人，亦會為證人申請匿名令，大律師關文渭指辯方沒有反對控方申匿名令，只是提出細微的修改。代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文亦問及傳召次序，指除鍾外尚有一名匿名證人及市民證人，萬同指會於午飯後回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指鍾錦麟不肯定電話密碼-為免資料被刪故無冒險嘗試&quot;&gt;控方指鍾錦麟不肯定電話密碼 為免資料被刪故無冒險嘗試&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪午休後解釋，鍾錦麟接受警方會面時表示不肯定他電話的密碼，雖然他提供了一些密碼組合，但若輸入錯誤便可能令電話資料全數刪除，故警方沒有冒險嘗試，但上周六（22日）終成功破解，林卓廷聞言笑着重複「last saturday」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬並指，已於午休時向辯方披露相關電子材料，並附有搜查令，理解當中包括200多則新訊息，而控方不會依賴任何新材料。李運騰指，相信辯方亦需時在證人作供前審視新材料，此做法較公平。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指收到逾2千whatsapp訊息-需時檢視申押周五續審&quot;&gt;辯方指收到逾2千WhatsApp訊息 需時檢視申押周五續審&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師沈士文其後稱，於午休時收到逾2,400則 WhatsApp 訊息，亦有很多附件，辯方需時審視，望押至周五續審。萬德豪回應，新披露訊息中有九成已被趙家賢的手機資料涵蓋，因來自同一群組。李運騰指，辯方需小心比較才能決定，他們檢視資料後，有可能要重新傳召區諾軒和趙家賢，故容讓辯方有足夠時間考慮很重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉終決定，將案件押至明早續審，若辯方需更多時間可再提出。代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑指，新資料是電子版本，未能給予還柙中的當事人，或需更多時間，陳慶偉同樣着明天再處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;盤問曾稱只出席首次會議-趙覆問下確認曾兩次出席港島會議&quot;&gt;盤問曾稱只出席首次會議 趙覆問下確認曾兩次出席港島會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方上午完成對趙家賢的盤問，並由主控萬德豪進行覆問。就出席的港島區協調會議次數，趙於主問曾稱出席了首兩次，惟接受盤問時稱只曾出席首次。萬德豪指，事發於近3年前，亦不是記憶測試，展示 WhatsApp 訊息向趙澄清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，在3月26日首次港島會議當晚近8時，曾向黎敬輝指「Ok, coming」，又着黎為他記錄重點，確認他有出席首次會議。李運騰一度問，晚上約10時趙曾發出4個表情符號，包括揮手圖案，問是什麼意思，趙邊揮手邊說：「即係喂喂喂喂我叫緊你咁解」，解釋當晚開會後與黎敬輝於附近用膳，黎一度走開，他遂問他在哪裡，同意當時會議已結束。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於4月17日第二次會議，趙確認黎當晚向他發訊息問港島區是否照開會，而翌日趙要求戴耀廷將與會者的名單發送給他，因他不認得部份人。萬問趙是否記得自己有否出席第二次會議，趙確認有，指「去咗可能睇到有啲人樣，唔係好認知邊個」，故叫戴將名單傳給他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙更正傳統民主派對否決財案僅表關注顧慮非反對指司馬文反對後無參與初選&quot;&gt;趙更正傳統民主派對否決財案僅表「關注顧慮」非反對、指司馬文反對後無參與初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，早前趙稱曾於會後與楊雪盈通電話，楊稱戴耀廷有很多想法並「由佢講」，認為參選人當選後可有自主權。萬問這通電話是何時發生，趙表示起碼是開了一次協調會議之後才聯絡，因楊當時是18區會議民主派的輪任召集人，而民動當時同意提供秘書處服務，因此與楊有很多溝通。萬追問通話是否在第一次會議後、第二次會議前發生，趙表示「抱歉主控，我淨係記得起碼肯定係第一次會議之後」，指他們傾談上述工作時，有談及戴耀廷的倡議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cXbSY3L.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 楊雪盈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬另問到，趙早前在2021年7月21日進行的第二次警誡錄影會面中，表示傳統民主派「反對否決財政預算案」，趙當時稱「反對」一詞應改為表達「關注和顧慮」。趙今確認說法，並解釋做法是「要釐清我當時嘅 perception（認知）係唔係好準確嘅」，因此要更正「反對」這個字眼。他又解釋有此理解是因為與司馬文的說法相比，司馬文當時在協調會上清楚講明「反對否決財政預算案」，並因應之後發展無參與初選及官方選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指何桂藍於鄒家成熱烈討論時提到將立會變抗爭陣地稱民主黨代表屬少數&quot;&gt;趙指何桂藍於鄒家成熱烈討論時提到將立會變「抗爭陣地」、稱民主黨代表屬少數&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續指，趙早前指何桂藍曾提及望將立法會變成「抗爭陣地」，將制度「推到盡」，問是什麼時候聽到何這樣說？趙稱是在協調會議。趙早前指，因他會上已聽到相關訊息，故着助手黎敬輝無需記錄；而他亦曾指在新東首次會議，鄒家成和莊榮輝有熱烈討論（heated exchange）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問，那何桂藍的話是在該討論之前抑或之後發生？趙指，何的說法亦是包含在該「熱烈討論（heated exchange）」之內，「咁所以我就係同返黎敬輝講，呢個我都睇到啦，所以佢就唔使記低」，並指要補充「其實係佢（黎敬輝）主動問我，因為嗰 part 真係太多人講嘢，要花好多時間記錄，所以佢咁樣問我」，鄒家成皺眉。李運騰指，故熱烈的討論是在不同人之間，而不止是鄒家成和莊榮輝？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙早前供稱，約有30人出席首次新東會議，陳慶偉問，那莊是屬於少數嗎？趙指「我觀察嘅形勢係相對 minority（少數）」，並指會上有超過一半本土抗爭派，鄒家成搖頭。陳再指，趙亦提及民主動力在會上亦被挑戰，趙同意，強調因為「民主動力成日畀本土抗爭派攻擊係傳統民主派嘅大台，想控制所有嘢咁樣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2023, the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at RUSI convened a roundtable in partnership with the Latvian Institute of International Affairs in Riga. The discussion, held under the Chatham House Rule, gathered representatives from government ministries and agencies, and the private sector – including banking institutions, law firms and consulting companies. The roundtable was hosted by the Financial Intelligence Unit of Latvia. The event is part of RUSI’s ongoing study of EU sanctions implementation and wider responses to illicit finance (Euro SIFMANet), funded by the National Endowment for Democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable discussion opened by finding a consensus on how well prepared Latvia was for the sanctions. Representatives from the FIU Latvia described how in the past several years, Latvia has undergone a significant overhaul of its national Anti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation Finance (AML/CFT/CPF) system, and its risk exposure to these threats has been at the top of the political and executive agenda. The process included rigorous transformations under the eye of the Financial Action Task Force and Moneyval’s International Co-operation and Review Group (ICRG) process. Through this process, Latvia worked to embed a high level of AML/CFT/CPF risk understanding and capacity by amending existing laws and supplementing them to comply with FATF Recommendations and enforcement measures, such as increasing the criminalisation of money laundering and predicate crimes (including ‘violation’ of sanctions), and setting up new institutional arrangements, such as a specialised Economic Affairs Court. Supervisors such as the Central Bank (Bank of Latvia) and the Financial and Capital Markets Commission worked to significantly improve guidance and feedback loops with supervised entities, and bolster internal control systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from Latvia’s Central Bank noted that the reforms ensured that the financial sector was ‘combat-trained’ for the implementation of the Russia restrictive measures regime following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Latvia built its current sanctions regime based on its experience with the post-2014 Crimean, Belarusian and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions. A representative from the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) described how the MFA created a sanctions division as a result of the Moneyval process, ensuring that sanctions were already front-and-centre in policy discussions at the time of the Russian invasion in 2022. The guidance and training that Latvia received throughout the ICRG process and from partners such as OFAC strengthened Latvia’s system to the point that it is now itself providing training to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latvian authorities described the national sanctions implementation framework as highly decentralised, with multiple agencies sharing a wide range of responsibilities. Despite the challenges posed by this decentralised system, participants agreed that the sanctions regime has been effective, in large part due to the financial sector reform of the previous few years. Violation of sanctions (both of EU and UN sanctions) is a criminal offence in Latvia, the sanctioned person and entity list is publicly available, and regular public–private collaboration ensures everyone is on the same page. In 2022, Latvian banks identified 35 entities linked to sanctioned entities or persons and froze more than €80 million. FIU Latvia received around 300 STRs, mostly linked to the evasion of sectoral sanctions. Supervisors have also conducted on-site inspections to ensure effective compliance. Tax and customs police initiated 114 criminal proceedings in relation to sanctions violation. The four major Latvian banks have stopped executing transactions to and from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;latvias-challenges&quot;&gt;Latvia’s Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative of the financial sector association, Finance Latvia, noted two main challenges. The first major challenge of sanctions stems mainly from a lack of cross-border harmonisation on legislation and implementation. How the issue of ‘control’ over an entity is identified in different countries often varies, creating confusion in handling activities that may be deemed sanctions evasion. A further issue cited by the private sector was the challenge of how to treat the risk from Russian sanctions targets using Central Asian countries for evasion and circumvention, ‘contaminating’ business dealings in that region. In addition, private sector actors pointed to the lack of sanctions-evasion prevention capacity in corporate sectors subject to sectoral sanctions. A shortage of sanctions expertise has limited the ability of these industries to raise their capabilities. Finance Latvia explained their ongoing trainings and seminars with their members’ clients, but it is difficult to make them catch up and build capacity for a capability that the financial sector has been engaged in since even before 2014. With this lack of capacity in mind, while it is important to ensure a rapid build-up of implementation capacity, the application of this capacity should be monitored, in order to prevent a cascade of de-risking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from the Customs Authority highlighted that the main challenge is not in the checking of goods but checking the connections between persons. The Latvian border is naturally at a high risk of exposure to organised crime and drug and alcohol trafficking. The monitoring process is further complicated by the number of exceptions in the customs and trade sanctions regimes, together with the tendency for transporters to use double sets of documentation that hide the legitimate destination of goods and get swapped once they cross the border to obfuscate trade between Russia, Central Asia and Latvia. In general, the customs representative highlighted that more could be done by the EU in this regard. For example, FRONTEX provides funds and support for building capacity to address people crossing the EU’s external borders, but not goods. Participants made a strong argument that as Latvia is among the few member states with direct exposure to Russia via a common border, more resources should be concentrated there to prevent sanctions breaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The representatives of the Employers Confederation emphasised that, in general, communication from the Latvian government has been very effective. However, they highlighted their experience with the overburdened systems of compliance of sanctions implementation, noting that members have repeatedly experienced funds getting seriously delayed in transactions with Central Asian counterparties. Participants found that more institutional collaboration between Latvia and Central Asia could result in better understanding of risks from this region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a clear consensus among participants about the additional difficulty stemming from Latvia’s close geographical proximity to Russia and Belarus. Certain designated entities had a substantial economic presence in Latvia, generating doubts about the best way to proceed with paying salaries, taxes or the continuity of economic activity generally. These payment complications have resulted in a trend of Latvian businesses trying to find banking options outside Latvia (notably in Lithuania), making oversight even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from both public and private sectors noted on multiple occasions that effective sanctions compliance in Latvia was possible for numerous reasons, but that continued access to the Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) Registry is an important one. The Registry started conducting analysis of ownership to support banks and businesses in complying with sanctions. The new power they received led the Registry to become a form of analytical centre in support of sanctions implementation. Unlike many other EU countries where beneficial ownership registries have been closed to public access as a result of a ruling by the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) in 2022, in Latvia, the government has been able to keep the Registry open. Latvia is one of the most open countries in the world regarding the availability of UBO data to the public and does not solely base its national legal framework on the legal norm currently repealed by the judgment of the CJEU. The Latvian framework was established before the 5th Directive came into force and had already assessed the balance of data privacy and public disclosure within the scope of other normative acts. As SIFMANet has found in other countries where registries have been closed, such action significantly complicates and impairs the effectiveness of sanctions implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, as sanctions become more sophisticated, the roundtable reached a consensus that the highly decentralised model followed by Latvia can be improved. FIU Latvia described the centralisation effort underway, via a newly designed body, to try to remedy this issue, and build a faster and more reliable feedback loop between the public and private sectors. The aim of this effort is to coordinate approaches and hold singular decision-making power, making it possible to support affected entities and make quick and effective judgements where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latvian authorities also found the need for centralisation to be a key element at the EU level. The challenges posed by the current lack of harmonisation in the EU must be addressed. While sanctions evasion is a crime in Latvia, it is not wholly criminalised in the EU, resulting in different levels of prioritisation in sanctions evasion prevention among partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, participants also agreed that the current state of beneficial ownership registries in the EU needs to be remedied. Registries must include accurate, up-to-date and accessible data. Although open registries should be the goal, even countries with an open and accessible registry (for example, the UK) suffer from unreliability because their data is unverified and therefore untrustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, though the role of Latvia as a gateway of financial flows eastward has been largely restricted, trade between Latvia and its neighbours continues. Representatives from the public and private sectors asserted that resources and staffing must continue to be dedicated to ensuring compliance with sanctions; and more international collaboration will be required to bolster the strength of the Latvian and Baltic borders, as this is also the main external border of the EU with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there was consensus at the roundtable that the European Commission must communicate more thoroughly with the private sector in regard to sectoral sanctions, otherwise this duty of informing businesses in the EU falls solely on the financial sector, which may not be best equipped to carry this burden alone. In this sense, participants agreed that the EU and national competent authorities should engage more with the private sector during the design of sanctions and immediately following their publication, to ensure that the desired measures are effectively implemented by the relevant sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第49天。趙家賢上周五供稱陳志全有出席首次新東協調會議，辯方播放陳於同一時間主持網台節目的片段質疑趙記錯，惟趙強調記得陳與助理有現身會議場地，對辯方提問「no comment」。趙今主動補充，稱經過多次回想，記得陳的助理蘇浩會上曾稱陳志全要做網台直播未能出席，故確認陳並無出席該次會議；而對其助手黎敬輝筆記稱陳志全有出席，趙解釋蘇浩身旁有一個「形態好似陳志全」的男子，故黎「應該係搞錯咗」、「認錯咗人」而寫錯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在盤問下亦同意，戴耀廷就共同綱領刻意不用「必定運用」否決權的字眼，以免有「白紙黑字」令參選人被DQ，而「積極運用」或「會運用」字眼均是留討論空間讓參選人自行決定。此外，法官今甫開庭提醒在法庭發表政見屬「藐視法庭」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉今甫開庭便嚴肅表示：「這裡是法庭，只處理法律議題，無論你政治理念如何，這也不是用來發表政見的場所。」他又指，絕對不反對在法庭以外表達政見，但若任何人有意或嘗試在法庭發表他們的政見，便是「藐視法庭」，「你會由我本人親自處理。」陳發言後被告一臉茫然，有人互相討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上周稱陳志全有出席新東首次會議-趙今主動作補充&quot;&gt;上周稱陳志全有出席新東首次會議 趙今主動作補充&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢其後入庭繼續接受盤問。代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉先向他說早晨，趙亦說「早晨馬大狀」，其後舉手說：「想問吓呢係唔好意思，我記得你上星期話如果我有回想到一啲情況，都可以照向你作答係咪？」馬表示不記得在什麼情況他有這樣提過，但問趙是否有話想說，惟法官陳慶偉打斷，着馬直接問問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在盤問下表示，沒有出席6月28日的新界東論壇，而他7月12日的初選投票日傍晚曾到新界東票站，但沒有看見陳志全。馬維騉再指，從2020年到趙被捕，除了第一次新東會議外，馬是否從沒與陳面對面交談？趙同意，並指他就是想就「新界東第一次會議陳志全是否出席嗰個問題」作補充。趙家賢上周曾稱陳志全有出席4月14日的首次新東會議，惟辯方播放陳同時段主持網台節目的片段，質疑趙記錯，趙則堅稱有回想到陳在教協會議室坐在助手蘇浩身旁的畫面，對辯方說法「no comment」，又對辯方稱陳兩次會議均無出席指「我只能夠答不同意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;上周稱對蘇浩發言無印象-趙今稱蘇曾提及陳志全要做網台直播無法出席&quot;&gt;上周稱對蘇浩發言無印象 趙今稱蘇曾提及陳志全要做網台直播無法出席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙今指，「我多次嘅回想返呢」，當日下的士後，「就買咗幾支茶」上教協會址開會，約8時到達，到場後助手黎敬輝為他預留身旁的位置。趙指雖然會議寫明7時開始，但實際上約7時半才開始，「都有好多人未到齊」，而他坐下準備拿電腦出來時，黎就向他交代當時情況，稱戴耀廷開場介紹協調和初選背景後，就讓在場團隊和參選人介紹自己，而趙到達時「仲係啲人士團隊介紹自己嘅時候」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，他剛坐下就將幾樽茶「行去拎畀戴耀廷同區諾軒，亦都畀咗一支我助手」，而助手「飲咗兩啖」後就稱要去洗手間，「還掂你到咗，你會唔會可以幫我睇住先」，陳志全、林卓廷、鄒家成、吳政亨等多人發笑。趙續指，黎去洗手間後，蘇浩發言介紹自己是人民力量執委，提及人民力量支持協調和會參與初選，並提到因為陳志全「有網台直播要做」，故「出席唔到」，向在座各位致歉，並特別提及「希望之後嘅會議可唔可以改唔係星期二嘅時間」。此時陳志全皺眉，林卓廷亦笑着搖頭。惟趙家賢上周五稱對陳志全和蘇浩發言沒有印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認陳志全首次新東會議不在場-指有男性形態似陳-助手認錯人致紀錄有錯&quot;&gt;趙確認陳志全首次新東會議不在場 指有男性形態似陳 助手認錯人致紀錄有錯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指，這是他所記得會面的情況，而翌日他收到助手筆記，看到寫有陳志全出席，「我就嗰陣時候有問返佢，咦，陳志全係咪有出席呀咁樣」，並指「因為我係早走咗，咁所以我唔知道係咪我離開咗之後陳志全有出席到」，而黎則回應「咦唔係，陳志全一開始咪坐咗喺蘇浩隔離囉」，林卓廷說「吓」，陳志全亦笑到全身震動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cFflhi6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 陳志全&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，「咁我記得蘇浩隔離係有一個男性，不過形態係好似陳志全咁」，林卓廷大聲說「哇」，陳志全亦皺眉發笑。在延伸庭的吳敏兒發笑，黃之鋒則「O嘴」。趙續說，「咁因應蘇浩嘅講法同埋我助手嘅講法，咁我確認陳志全係當時不在會議」，林卓廷說「吓？」，趙再說：「因為我助手應該係搞錯咗嗰個人，佢以為係陳志全」，因而在筆記寫上陳志全和蘇浩二人出席，林再說：「唔係呀？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬問，故是黎敬輝弄錯了？趙指「我確認佢唔係嗰個紀錄佢有搞錯，係因為佢認錯咗人而導致個紀錄寫錯」，馬指這正是他的意思。馬其後再問，故趙確認陳志全沒有出席？惟法官認為趙家賢已清楚回答，着辯方問其他問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指陳志全沒有提交政綱-趙同意無看過其政綱&quot;&gt;辯方指陳志全沒有提交政綱 趙同意無看過其政綱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙其後確認，在整個2020年到他被捕，從沒有面對面或透過電話與陳志全交談，亦沒有以 WhatsApp 與陳有私人的聯絡。馬續展示陳的提名表格，指陳沒有附上任何政綱。趙指根據表格上職員的寫法，陳的政綱是於6月22日才補交。馬問趙知道陳有補交文件嗎？趙指只是綜合性聽到職員指各區都收齊文件，但職員沒特別講明陳有沒有交，而趙沒有見過陳的政綱，亦不記得其政綱內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;選舉按金收據顯示由黎敬輝於6月19日簽發，法官李運騰指出提名表格簽署的日期是6月20日，問提名表格和其他文件會於不同時間繳交嗎？趙指根據職員的標示，相信表格一定是於6月19日下午收到，而表格可能由陳志全預先簽署並填上日期，再交職員幫手報名，故日期有出入。他再同意，在整個初選過程中，「就算我有睇民主動力嘅文件，我都冇睇到陳志全嘅方格表同政綱。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱5至6名兼職職員有民動fb帳戶密碼並可登入&quot;&gt;趙稱5至6名兼職職員有民動FB帳戶密碼、並可登入&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後就民主動力及趙家賢的個人 Facebook 提問。趙確認案發時民主動力只有一個 Facebook 帳戶，而除了他及總幹事黎敬輝，約有5至6名兼職職員擁有密碼，並可登入有關帳戶。馬問登入 Facebook 帳戶是否只需一個密碼，並指「這可能是一個愚蠢的問題」，趙思考了一會仍未有作答，馬隨即問：「我這個問題是否太愚蠢？」，旁聽席傳來笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指他未能回答，因他是透過電話上 Facebook，登入後就長期可以登入，亦很久沒有透過電腦登入，故只能說民主動力 Facebook 創立時應只用一組密碼就可登入。馬其後問民動副召集人鍾錦麟有沒有密碼，法官陳仲衡打斷指這要問鍾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱職員可發帖或改動內容-非不受控制-但有時太忙未必經他檢視下發帖&quot;&gt;趙稱職員可發帖或改動內容 非不受控制 但有時太忙未必經他檢視下發帖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續問，是否該些人士可以隨意進入民主動力 Facebook 發布和轉發任何內容，趙同意，指據黎敬輝稱兼職職員有此權限。法官陳慶偉續問，最極端的例子，他們可否發表與民動政治理念相違背的想法？趙表示：「如果冇特別睇嗰個帖文，佢哋（兼職職員）有時都會按需要擺嘢上去。」陳追問他們是否不受任何控制，趙稱：「呢個唔係嘅」，並解釋因為其工作量，「未必係我或者我嘅總幹事能夠睇住或者處理」，因此他與總幹事會向職員講解訊息方向，並由他們處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續展示趙家賢在無損權益口供中的內容，他曾表示民主動力登入密碼有多人知道，包括他、黎敬輝及部分活動團隊職員，由趙授權他們處理 Facebook，趙並會就發帖制定方向，授權秘書處發帖，趙指「我會盡量在發出前先檢視。但有時太忙，會授權同事未經本人檢視下發帖。」趙確認該說法，並確認自己有兩個個人 Facebook 帳戶，而其職員擁有密碼，並獲授權處理該兩個帳戶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;民主動力轉發朱凱廸回應譚耀宗帖文-稱立會過半觸憲政危機-趙稱助手建議轉發&quot;&gt;民主動力轉發朱凱廸回應譚耀宗帖文 稱立會過半觸憲政危機 趙稱助手建議轉發&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示民主動力在2020年3月27日的 Facebook 帖文，轉發同案被告朱凱廸對《香港01》 〈【基本法30年】譚耀宗：倘泛民議會過半觸發憲政危機 中央勢出手〉一文的回應，趙同意當時批准發布該帖文。趙同意，譚耀宗是全國人大常委，指「佢喺建制派有足夠嘅政治份量去解讀一啲中央嘅政治政策同訊息」。馬一度問全國人大常委是否獲授權解釋《基本法》的權力，惟陳慶偉指嚴格來說是不正確的，指人大常委並非由中央政府賦權釋法，而是由《中華人民共和國憲法》賦權，又指與普通法系統不同。趙同意指國家憲法授權全國人大和全國人大常委解釋法律。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬又一度問《香港01》是否可靠的媒體，趙指「回應法官閣下，我首先要講吓我對新聞嘅解讀」，林卓廷說「嘩」。法官陳仲衡問其答案是否長，趙笑言「好短㗎咋」，鄒家成搖頭擺手。李運騰追問是否需要，馬說不，多人大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱無印象3月尾有人說初選違法&quot;&gt;趙稱無印象3月尾有人說初選違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，譚耀宗提及民主派議會過半會觸發憲政危機，中央會有辦法應對，而朱凱廸則作出回應。趙主動補充，由於戴耀廷3月26日的記者會民主動力「完全冇獲邀請」、「完全被排除在外」，而當時知道朱凱廸帖文有談及記者會發言的綜合訊息，故決定轉發，惟陳慶偉打斷指與問題無關。馬續指，為何會在所有帖文中選擇轉發朱凱廸的帖文？趙回應，是由助手找到帖文和作建議，認為朱凱廸有談及會上意見，「轉發嘅話就令公眾印象覺得民主動力喺呢件事有參與咁樣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，雖然當時有份量的建制派指初選或觸發憲政危機，但沒有提及初選的合法性問題？李運騰改問，即直至2020年3月底，趙知道香港社會有人說初選可能違法嗎？趙表示：「回應李運騰法官閣下，我冇乜印象，因為嗰時民主動力係如火如荼咁推緊選民登記個計劃。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱錄第二份口供時知道正向控方提供證據-但不確定需否上庭&quot;&gt;趙稱錄第二份口供時知道正向控方提供證據 但不確定需否上庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬其後展示趙家賢於今年1月10日錄取的第二份「無損權益口供（NPS）」，問他當時是否已知自己會被傳召為控方證人，趙思考一會後表示，他做第一份NPS時，知道情況是「就住之後嗰個案件向控方同法庭提供資料，而有需要嘅話係需要出庭作證。但係有可能之後覺得我嘅供詞、我嘅資料係冇乜幫助嘅話呢，就可能無需要做證」。李運騰續問，他在錄取第二份供詞時，是否還未決定成為控方證人或在法庭作供，趙回應：「我知道我係幫手畀緊證供、畀緊證據，但係咪要上庭，呢個就未確定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認積極運用或會運用留空間讓參選人決定刻意不用必定運用&quot;&gt;趙確認「積極運用」或「會運用」留空間讓參選人決定、刻意不用「必定運用」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續引述書面供詞，提及「戴耀廷認為交由各個選區的協調會討論『積極』或是『會』『運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案』較為恰當。不論寫『積極運用』或是『會運用』都無損共同綱領嘅內容，唔同用字只係想留番討論空間俾參選人自行決定」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，會上曾討論運用否決權的字眼，而不論用什麼字眼，戴也是想留空間讓參選人自行決定，並指因此民主動力在製作提名表格時，會如「九二共識」，「一個中國，各自表述」，「本身個思維都係唔同嘅字眼，等大家按佢哋嘅需要交代而去揀選」，但同意不論使用哪一字眼，都不會影響共同綱領的內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙亦在供詞提到，「（戴認為）唔清楚寫成『必定運用基本法賦予立法會權力去否決財政預算案』就可以規避責任，有助參選人免卻被選舉主任取消參選資格」，趙盤問下同意戴是刻意不使用「必定運用」字眼，「意思係唔好寫到死、有啲白紙黑字嘅嘢，到候選人報名參選時有啲枝節麻煩嘅嘢發生」。馬最後問，「積極使用」、「會運用」兩者的意思均不等於「必定運用」？趙表示：「我諗從一個一般常人嘅解讀，呢3個應該有唔同嘅程度喺度。」馬維騉續表示盤問完畢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TX9a0G9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第49天。趙家賢接受代表鄒家成的大狀盤問，就新東首次會議的情況，辯方指會上無就運用否決權討論，而鄒家成亦沒有說「要用盡方法去迫政府回應五大訴求」。惟趙不同意，強調親眼目睹鄒家成和民主黨代表莊榮輝就否決預算案「直情企咗起身」討論，而其助手筆記無記錄相關情況，是因「我睇住成個片段喺我腦海度」，想助手「慳功夫」，故着他「呢 part 唔使寫」。趙又一度模仿莊榮輝激動稱：「難道起醫院起學校都要反對呀？」，指當時「直情係有啲情緒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，繼早上主動改稱陳志全無出席新東首次會議，趙下午突然再主動補充，指細心回想後，記起鄭達鴻和彭卓棋應在2020年6月底《國安法》將頒布時，曾分別提出刪除政綱和將政綱改為留白。此前辯方就此提問時，趙均稱沒有印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙早前指不記得鄭達鴻有否改政綱-今主動稱記起公民黨要求delete&quot;&gt;趙早前指不記得鄭達鴻有否改政綱 今主動稱記起公民黨要求「delete」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表陳志全的大狀馬維騉早上完成盤問，趙家賢下午主動表示，希望就辯方早前的提問作補充：「法官閣下抱歉，我知道我喺法庭要就我所知盡量回應，就之前兩位大律師兩個事項嘅提問呢，我細心回想到一啲訊息」。他亦對可能打亂流程表示抱歉，「所以我係想請示法官閣下應該係點處理」，林卓廷發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指示他可作補充，趙續指是有關鄭達鴻和彭卓棋代表大狀就選舉政綱的問題。代表鄭達鴻的大律師黃宇逸盤問時曾提及，公民黨在《國安法》後曾要求將政綱修訂為「無字政綱」，惟趙稱沒有印象。趙今表示，自己當時「真係諗唔起任何嘢」，但現在回想，記得助手當時曾向他表示：「公民黨佢哋嗰面呢，係就住佢哋幾位候選人嘅政綱係想更新嘅」，並指他們因知道國內已制定《國安法》 ，但尚未在港通過，由於「唔想有一啲咬文嚼字，過唔到選舉主任」，故就選舉政綱作出更正，並「delete 咗整個選舉政綱」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙記起職員稱赤柱區議員想將政綱改為留白-回想起是彭卓棋&quot;&gt;趙記起職員稱赤柱區議員想將政綱改為留白 回想起是彭卓棋&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於彭卓棋代表大律師盧敏儀提及，彭曾向民動職員「Christy」提出要移除全部政綱，趙盤問下同樣稱沒有印象。趙今解釋「我當時都係即時無任何特別回憶喺當中」，但「細心回想返呢，我就記得我兼職職員 Christy 有同我講過話，『赤柱嗰個』政綱有啲嘢想改」，並指「個改法係成個留空白」，問趙應如何處理，趙當時吩咐「咁就照跟佢意思去做啦」。趙續指，當時職員沒有講明是彭卓棋，但之後回想才記起彭卓棋是時任赤柱區議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8cvFRxl.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱兩人應是6月底要求收回政綱-當時有消息指已通過國安法&quot;&gt;趙稱兩人應是6月底要求收回政綱 當時有消息指已通過《國安法》&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問到是甚麼時候發生，趙表示一定是初選投票日之前的事。陳仲衡追問是2020年7月1日前還是後，趙稱現在推敲應該是6月底，因為當時收到消息指已通過《國安法》，但尚未頒佈條文。趙確認鄭達鴻及彭卓棋均為港島區候選人，李運騰問修改政綱是發生在6月27日港島選舉論壇前還是後？趙表示：「抱歉法官閣下，我未能夠作答到，因為選舉論壇唔係我負責。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問兩人是否想收回選舉政綱，趙表示：「從佢哋嘅做法係嘅。」大律師黃宇逸續表示希望保留盤問，因需向其當事人索取指示。惟陳慶偉指，不希望不斷有不同律師進行盤問，若趙明天又有新事項補充，事情就會沒完沒了，着黃宇逸如有其他問題想問，可找其他律師幫忙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指新東首次會議無討論否決權鄒家成無提用盡方法逼政府-趙不同意&quot;&gt;辯方指新東首次會議無討論否決權、鄒家成無提用盡方法逼政府 趙不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢其後接受代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑盤問。趙確認有兩次新東會議，他只曾出席4月14日的首次會議並遲到早退，會上亦忙於以電腦處理區議會事務。趙並曾供稱，戴在該次會議提倡「會積極運用」基本法權力否決預算案，會上討論有「火花」，鄒家成曾稱「要用盡方法去迫政府回應五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑指出，當日會上從來沒有出現「會積極運用」否決權的討論，而鄒家成亦沒有說過該句話，惟趙均不同意。陳續指，趙會上專注力一半半（half-hearted），需依賴助手筆記協助記憶發生的事，趙同意，指「喺嗰啲我冇特別留心聽嘅議題上面係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意首次新東會議主要討論應否有共同綱領&quot;&gt;趙同意首次新東會議主要討論應否有共同綱領&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續展示黎敬輝就首次會議的筆記，提及李永成，問趙記得李永成在場嗎？法官李運騰改問沒有筆記的話，趙有否任何獨立記憶李在場？趙靜默多時答：「而家冇嘅」。陳續展示筆記，指當日會上曾討論不同議題，主要是共同綱領，其中吳文遠提到「大家可制訂共同綱領」、將軍澳青年力量稱「必須有共同綱領」，何桂藍亦稱「必須有約束力初選」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 代表鄒家成的大律師 陳世傑&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳問，趙是否記得這是會上主要（predominantly）討論的議題？趙同意，並指會上有討論是否要初選、對初選的不同意見，及應該要有大家都同意的綱領等。李運騰問，討論是關於應否有共同綱領，抑或如有共同綱領，應包括什麼內容？趙指「兩方面都有討論，不過前者係多啲」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指筆記只曾提一次否決權-趙稱是助手就會上重點綜合寫咗落嚟&quot;&gt;辯方指筆記只曾提一次否決權 趙稱是助手就會上重點「綜合寫咗落嚟」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續展示黎敬輝筆記，提及鄒家成指「認同初選排位，民調最後決定或只以民調決定」，指鄒並非談及否決權，而是排名制度，趙指「喺呢句嘅記錄，係」。陳續問是否與趙的記憶相符？趙指排位制度與初選如何揀選最多人支持的候選人有關，當時會上有討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，根據筆記，共同綱領和否決權只曾被一併談及一次，而且是由戴耀廷提出，即「共同綱領原則是否決財政預算案，迫政府解散立法會，今次任期可能只有7個月」。趙同意，「個筆記就咁展示，就咁睇，係」，但指其助手是就會上重點「綜合咁寫咗落嚟」。李運騰問是助手綜合會上每人所說的重點，抑或是戴耀廷綜合與會者的說法，趙指「兩樣都有」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指目睹鄒家成和民主黨莊榮輝企起身討論-故着助手無需記錄&quot;&gt;趙指目睹鄒家成和民主黨莊榮輝「企起身」討論 故着助手無需記錄&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，事實上趙並不知道，因這是黎敬輝的紀錄，而趙沒有告訴他怎樣記錄。趙重申他於會議早走前，坐在黎身旁，而提到戴耀廷就否決預算案的倡議時，整個討論有「火花」，「嗰個位因為我睇住，所以我就叫咗我助手呢 part 唔使寫啦」，鄒家成皺眉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳問趙為何要這樣說？是想要在紀錄隱瞞什麼嗎？趙重申之前被其他大狀問及時也有表示：「橫掂我自己都聽咗、睇住個情況，莊榮輝同鄒家成直情企咗起身，我睇住成個片段喺我腦海度，我想職員慳返啲功夫，呢 part 就唔使佢寫啦」，鄒家成一臉驚訝和皺眉，再與林卓廷相視而笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，趙稱鄒家成和莊榮輝「企咗起身」，是「比喻」抑或他們真的有這樣做？趙指「法官閣下唔係比喻，係我直情見住⋯直情係有啲情緒」，他一度雙手張開發出急促的聲音，林卓廷和法庭傳譯即問：「咩話？」趙續稱：「好記得莊榮輝嗰句，『難道起醫院起學校都要反對呀？』，就企咗起身」，說時刻意提高聲調模仿另一人腔調，鄒家成發笑，趙同意法官陳仲衡指有熾熱的討論。陳再指會上沒提及否決預算案，惟陳慶偉指可留待陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意筆記顯示第二次會議有重點討論否決預算案&quot;&gt;趙同意筆記顯示第二次會議有重點討論否決預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於5月5日的第二次會議，趙並無出席，但確認有看過黎敬輝的筆記，事後亦從黎和戴耀廷了解會上情況。趙同意根據筆記，會上有重點（prominently）討論否決預算案的議題，其中沙田區議會主席程張迎曾提及「否決預算案是由 CP（公民黨）提出」，另「豐」表示「CP 對，不能迴避否決預算案的方向」。趙確認公民黨於3月開記者會提及否決財案，而「豐」是公民黨的高級職員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑又問，筆記提及的「文遠」（吳文遠）是否來自社民連，趙同意並指：「文遠係一個人嚟嘅，代表社民連。」趙同意根據紀錄，吳文遠曾稱：「有些功能組別民主派參選人，可能對否決 budget 猶豫，可能需中間落墨，要佢哋參與機制，就算不需初選」，而李永成曾稱：「應該以入閘為目標，策略上不要太突出，故不贊成初選時已表明否決預算案。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意會上否決財案備受討論-有贊成和保留兩種意見&quot;&gt;趙同意會上否決財案備受討論 有贊成和保留兩種意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳問到，筆記是否顯示就否決財政預算案，會上明顯至少有贊成和保留兩種不同意見，趙同意指：「根據我助手整理嘅筆記，係。」李運騰問，那除了助手的筆記，根據他從黎和戴的印象，當日會議是否就否決預算案有很多討論（much debated topic）？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙未有直接回答，僅表示「個時間重點係擺喺嗰度多啲」，因很多區快將達成協議和將舉行初選，因此戴耀廷認為「有個時間性，希望可以攞到共識」。李運騰打斷，提醒趙聽清楚問題再回答，指這十分重要，並重複再問當天會上，否決預算案是否備受討論，趙同意但補充：「我唔知個討論氣氛去到點。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉再打斷，強調不是問他會上的氣氛，並指李運騰問了「非常簡單」的問題。李運騰和陳慶偉最後再問，根據筆記和趙與二人的對話，當天會上否決預算案是否一個備受討論的議題？趙思考數秒後回答：「係，冇錯。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第48天。代表何桂藍的大狀今繼續質疑趙家賢可信性，指其供詞等無提及民動於2020年5月才獲邀承辦初選，民動實早於3月已承辦。趙極不同意，反指辯方「咬文嚼字」；並指警方供詞僅就案情「大方向」作記錄，民動何時承辦並非重點，又主動提及何桂藍在新東協調會議上曾提及望立會變成「抗爭陣地」，引致「中港關係破局」。被問作供時是否將自己表現（put forward）得溫和，趙激動回答：「I’m not put myself forward, I just told the fact.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙又表示不同意戴耀廷提倡的「大殺傷力憲制武器」，辯方質疑與他選擇認罪不符，又質疑趙作供時嘗試將自己的參與講到最低，並怪責和誇大他人參與以換取較輕刑期。趙不同意，指「我有責任係去協助作證」，向法庭講述他所知的情況，惟在法官追問下同意知道認罪和任控方證人有可能換取減刑，但「冇 guarantee 嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢供詞曾稱留意到初選可能犯法-但身不由己故無退出&quot;&gt;趙家賢供詞曾稱留意到初選可能犯法 但「身不由己」故無退出&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊昨因有被告不適而提早結束，據悉是何桂藍。何今如常入庭，精神不俗，未有配戴口罩，但不時以紙巾抹鼻涕。法官陳仲衡甫開庭便詢問何的代表大狀 Trevor Beel，指昨聽說其當事人不適，問她今天身體怎樣？Beel 指她今日到庭，相信已好轉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 昨指民主動力早於2020年2月已獲邀出席商討初選的會議，趙強調該次只是「初步交流」，民動是於5月中下旬才正式答應承辦。Beel 今再引不同文件就民動答應承辦初選的時間發問，先展示趙於2022年9月為警方錄取的首份書面供詞，提及於2020年3月尾至4月頭，區諾軒致電他指戴耀廷欲籌辦初選，區建議由民主動力幫手，故聯絡趙邀請民動協助籌辦。趙指由於2018年民動有辦立法會補選初選的經驗，亦望協助增加民主派在立法會的話語權，故「我與『民主動力』副召集人鍾錦麟商討後，決定答應邀請，協助戴耀廷籌辦初選，但負責範圍及有關初選嘅細節並無於當刻決定」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，「3月尾至4月頭」應為2月，Beel 再問趙是否同意供詞所說？趙大聲湊前咪高峰說：「Disagree.」Beel 問，即供詞內容是否真實？趙指「係真實嘅，係整個事情嘅簡約版」。法官李運騰指，留意到「當刻」被譯作「on that day」，但中文亦可譯作「at that time（那時）」，即沒有指明日期，Beel 接受。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續讀出趙在2023年1月的供詞，再提及3月尾至4月頭，「當我同戴耀廷及區諾軒一開始籌備初選時」，原望協助民主派議會過半，同時推廣民動工作、「令我哋更為人熟識」，故答應帶領民動協辦初選。但隨協調工作開展，他在會上聽到戴和參選人提及入立會後否決預算案，戴4月尾亦宣傳「攬炒十步曲」，趙指雖無清楚了解，但有印象戴稱透過兩次否決財案，迫行政長官解散立法會和辭職，是「憲制武器」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，當時初選已成社會焦點，「雖然我留意到戴耀廷所講話要藉初選取得立法會控制權去否決財案有可能犯法，明白到策劃初選係有違反《國安法》或香港其他法例嘅風險，但當時我已身不由己，作為初選主辦單位之一，如果我未完成初選就退出，不但未能符合當時支持民主陣營嘅市民之期望，而且對我本人聲譽及民主動力發展上會有反效果」，故即使知道戴的最終計劃是要令特首辭職，仍繼續初選工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑供詞無提5月被邀承辦初選-趙警方僅就案情大方向取資料&quot;&gt;辯方質疑供詞無提5月被邀承辦初選 趙：警方僅就案情「大方向」取資料&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，上述段落是否真確？趙答：「全部都係整個案情嘅事實嘅一個綜合版。」Beel 指，但當中沒有提及民動在5月被邀請承辦初選？趙解釋，因警方撰寫「無損權益口供」時要就「整個案情嘅大方向去取得有關嘅資料」，而他與鍾錦麟已認罪，警方錄口供時不認為民主動力何時承辦初選是「重點」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙又指，在錄影會面有提到5月才確認承辦初選，故曾問警方指他3月尾4月頭與戴及區籌備初選，「我有同佢講依個位係咪打出嚟唔係太表達到我嘅原意呢？」，警方則解釋因當時民動雖未答應承辦初選，但有獲邀列席會議提供意見，故就案情大方向如此撰寫。趙指，「我講咗好多當時嘅資料訊息畀當時嘅警察聽」，惟在供詞中「警方都並不是將所有我講過嘅嘢寫晒落去」；他又笑言，「我相信依個法庭見證我作證，包括三位法官閣下都有時嫌我講嘢比較長氣同譖」，故警方亦是綜合處理案情的需要做紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指心底裡覺得初選有問題-惟因社會氣氛葉劉及湯家驊稱初選不違法故無退出&quot;&gt;趙指心底裡覺得初選有問題 惟因社會氣氛、葉劉及湯家驊稱初選不違法故無退出&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續主動提及，以同一準則，警方也有問及他何桂藍協調會上的說話，惟 Beel 打斷指他扯得太遠。李運騰並問，趙曾於7月的記者會上稱初選不違法，但供詞卻稱初選前其實已知道有法律風險？趙指「回應法官閣下，喺我自己個人心底裡面，我係會覺得有啲問題嘅」，李問他何時開始質疑「35+計劃」的合法性？趙指是6月底7月初，而他在記者會稱初選是合法，主要是就選舉相關法例和私隱條例。趙又重申，戴當時作為法律學者表明初選不會違法，而參與的政黨有資深大律師和大律師亦「冇特別出聲」，「我只係作為法律相關服務業嘅調解員，我又點可能話依個一定係違法？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李再問，但趙供詞稱意識到可能犯法，惟因不望影響其聲譽及民主動力發展才繼續，故他不是相信沒違法，而是知道違法仍被逼繼續？趙先指，警方錄口供時內容未必順序，「如果淨係睇一段嘢⋯係睇唔到我當時表達嘅全部情況。」李問那當時他的心態是怎樣？是因為怕影響個人聲譽及民主動力發展才不敢退縮？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙回答：「當時我當然有部分依個嘅思維喺度，因為嗰陣時候我心底裡面我個人係覺得其實梗係唔做好過做，因為唔去做、唔去掂嘅話就梗係完全冇任何風險啦」，惟趙指，當時已答應承辦初選，「而當時嘅社會氣氛，無論民間又好，所有政治陣營又好，係好熱切期盼個初選繼續舉行」；加上戴清楚講明沒有違法，而傳媒亦有訪問行政會議成員葉劉淑儀同湯家驊，二人均不覺得初選違法，「我心裡面係有疑問、顧慮，但當我身邊就算係建制陣營都有訊息話冇違法嘅話，所以當時好難話即刻退出。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，建制派是認為只是舉行初選不違法，抑或包括否決預算案令特首下台的主張？趙重申當時整個民主陣營的認知，是行政會議成員、資深大律師也說初選無違法，而民動作為初選的「服務提供者」，就民動負責的事「我唔覺得有任何違法」，故有上述看法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱何桂藍望將立會變抗爭陣地引致中港關係破局&quot;&gt;趙稱何桂藍望將立會變「抗爭陣地」、引致「中港關係破局」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡其後向 Beel 指，趙家賢曾提及何桂藍會上發言，若 Beel 不讓趙解釋，控方或會在覆問提問，意味屆時辯方不能再就此提問。Beel 續問趙家賢關於何桂藍有何想說？趙表示，警方錄口供時曾向他了解何在會上的發言，而他有憶述何「都有好特別講到佢睇法係立法會係變咗一個抗爭嘅陣地，佢就希望將立法會就用作作為中港關係嘅破局，引致到中港關係嘅破局」，此時何桂藍微微皺眉和發笑，又向律師席做口形，鄒家成則搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續解釋，何經常提出的「破局」，「其實係將整個制度去到推到盡，而係將本身中國同香港嘅一國兩制、整個政治制度個運作去打破」，被告席傳出低聲的「嘩」。陳慶偉問，是「突破（breakthrough）」，抑或「打破（break down）」？趙回應「我諗兩個意思都有啲嘅，咁依個當然係我嘅理解啦」。何桂藍微笑又聳肩，林卓廷和鄒家成亦發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙再稱何發言沒記在助手筆記-因當時聽到着無需記錄-多人發笑&quot;&gt;趙再稱何發言沒記在助手筆記 因當時聽到着無需記錄 多人發笑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉再問，是「是透過打破來達致突破（to breakdown in order to breakthrough）？」，趙指「有依個意思」，又指何因想透過立法會做到該效果，「就會變咗係議會戰線同國際戰線呢就一齊去聯合嘅」。陳慶偉指，何是抗爭派，那是典型（typical）的發言，趙同意，並指警方錄口供時指何的政治信念和看法「其實喺其他嘅證供都好充分」，故不特別需要他講解，亦沒有記錄在供詞上，林卓廷一度說「嘩」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指，因此趙剛才所說的沒有記錄在其供詞，亦沒有被他很盡責的總幹事黎敬輝記錄在新東兩次會議的筆記上？趙答：「因為我頭先都講咗，我聽到相關嘅訊息，咁我叫佢無需要記錄」，鄒家成、林卓廷等多人發笑，吳政亨笑到俯身，頭埋在膝上電腦。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指民動3月已答應承辦初選-趙極之不正確&quot;&gt;辯方指民動3月已答應承辦初選 趙：極之不正確&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續展示民主動力眾籌網頁的內容，其中在35+計劃內容和進度的部分，顯示2020年3月「戴耀廷及區諾軒作主導，民主動力協助，與18區區議會民主派主席、副主席及民選議員，以及民主派人士進行協調會議，商討立法會選舉的協調安排」。另外內容又提及2020年5月，「多方逐步達成共識，立法會5個地方選區，及屬功能組別的區議會（第二）及衛生服務界，一致決定會進行民主派35+公民投票。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問到，文件沒有提及民主動力於5月答應承辦初選，是因為他們在3月已經答應？趙回答：「極之不正確。」而趙早前提及此頁面是沒有公開，李運騰再次要求趙確認，趙稱這是助手應國安處要求所提供的資料，是登入了網頁的編輯版面。李問到公眾可否進入此頁面，法官陳慶偉則問有沒有向公眾發布過，趙表示不能肯定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指民動2至3月已開始參與初選-趙係咬文嚼字式嘅提問&quot;&gt;辯方指民動2至3月已開始參與初選 趙：係咬文嚼字式嘅提問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後展示民主動力工作報告，在「獲委託承辦民主派35+公民投票」一欄，亦提到「2020年3月開始，戴耀廷及區諾軒主導，民主動力協助，各區議會民主派正副主席主持⋯與民主派人士於各區進行協調會議，最終達成共識一致決定舉行公民投票」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再問，民主動力是否於2020年3月開始參與？李運騰要求釐清「參與」的意思，陳慶偉並改問，即趙家賢和民主動力就「35+」的參與是比他說的5月要早很多，可能早於2月及3月已開始，問他是同意、不同意或部分同意？趙表示：「法官閣下，依個其實係咬文嚼字式嘅一啲提問嚟㗎啫」，延伸庭的黃之鋒聞後「O嘴」，岑敖暉則面露驚訝。陳慶偉解釋，辯方並非「咬文嚼字」提問，只是向他指出其說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙最後同意早於3月協調會民動已有參與35計劃&quot;&gt;趙最後同意早於3月協調會民動已有參與「35+計劃」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最後趙稱：「回應法官閣下，其實而家螢幕睇到，『獲委託承辦』嗰句我其實琴日都已經有講解過」，陳追問即他不同意？趙表示要補充3月底時，民動已獲邀列席協調會議並提供意見，「呢個係一個事實嚟嘅，但係⋯」，惟遭李運騰打斷。李指，「參與」一詞的意思廣闊，可意指自己或派代表出席會議，或是在會上發言，而若上述任何一項都可被歸類為「參與」，那民主動力是否早於3月已參與在「35+計劃」中？趙回答：「喺依方面係嘅」，黃之鋒發笑。陳仲衡追問，文件同時提及民動「協助」與「悉託承辦」，意思是否有不同？趙指「非常大嘅不同啦當然」，惟欲解釋時陳慶偉打斷指無需深究。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙不同意戴耀廷無正式邀請民動承辦初選-原因為他們一早參與其中&quot;&gt;趙不同意戴耀廷無正式邀請民動承辦初選 原因為他們一早參與其中&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢曾稱5月初獲戴耀廷邀請承辦初選，Beel 引述戴耀廷於2020年5月9日向趙家賢發訊息稱，「昨天與鍾庭耀傾過，希望由民動去眾籌初選及民調，再委託他們做。你認為眾籌之事在此記者會講還是另安排眾籌記者會？民動過去有用眾籌平台嗎？」Beel 指，戴沒有提及邀請民動承辦初選，趙沉默數秒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，Beel 是向他指出，戴在書面上沒有提及邀請民動承辦初選。趙沉默10秒後表示，早前曾提及戴本想找香港民意研究所的鍾庭耀負責眾籌及初選，但由於「鍾庭耀嗰邊唔制」，戴遂與鍾商討想由民動負責眾籌，而民研只是負責投票點票系統和技術工作；又指因設立地區票站、人力資源等「香港民研係不會負責嘅」，因此戴想民動幫忙。Beel 指出，戴耀廷之所以沒有提及正式邀請民動承辦初選，是因為民動一早已經參與在組織初選當中？趙直接用英文回答：「extremely disagree.（極不同意。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問是否表現自己為政治立場溫和-趙激動答僅說事實-官提醒不要覺得被針對&quot;&gt;辯方問是否表現自己為政治立場溫和 趙激動答僅說事實 官提醒不要覺得被針對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，趙作供時是否嘗試將自己表現成政治立場溫和、並會在2019年示威中進行調解的人？趙立即回答：「你再講多次，我驚個翻譯有失誤。」Beel 再重複，問趙作供時是否將自己表現成政治立場溫和（“You have put yourself forward as someone politically moderate …”)，並願在2019年示威中調解（mediate）的人？趙瞪着 Beel 大聲激動回答：「I’m not put(ting) myself forward, I just told the fact!（我不是要這樣表現自己，只是說出事實！）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉着趙以廣東話回答，又稱：「Don’t get personal, he’s doing his job.（不要覺得要針對你個人，律師只是做他的工作。）」，並指若趙不同意的話可以照直說不同意，並再次說「Don’t get personal」。最後趙細聲說：「I disagree.（不同意。）」在延伸庭的黃之鋒發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑趙不同意使用大殺傷力憲制武器與選擇認罪不符&quot;&gt;辯方質疑趙不同意使用「大殺傷力憲制武器」與選擇認罪不符&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 最後向趙家賢指出辯方案情，指民主動力實早於2020年2至3月已參與「35+計劃」，而退出的唯一原因就是因受到國務院和港澳辦譴責，惟法官指此前趙已回答。Beel 續問趙是否支持戴耀廷使用「大殺傷力憲制武器」？趙不同意。Beel 說，根據控方案情，這似乎與趙選擇認罪不符（inconsistent），惟陳慶偉打斷，並着趙家賢先避席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，簡言之辯方問題是趙為什麼要認罪，Beel 同意，指控方案情是指控被告透過立會過半解散立會和令特首下台，意味趙家賢若認罪便要承認此案情。陳慶偉問為何不留待陳詞，Beel 再指因為趙證供似乎與他認罪不符，故想問趙以什麼基礎認罪？陳指，趙可以因為不同原因認罪，但辯方和法庭或因「法律專業保密特權（Legal Professional Privilege，LPP）」而不能問及，Beel 指他理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，故 Beel 最終是希望指出趙的證供與他認罪是完全不符，並以此質疑他的可信性，但重申不認為需要問趙為何認罪。李運騰指，相關發問或違 LPP，問 Beel 能想到其他方法處理嗎？陳慶偉亦指，當然知道辯方的說法，就是趙最終將所有責任推到他的職員身上，並只是承認對監察職員的疏忽，即沒有做到『盡職審查』的責任（“… essentially he put all the blame on his staff, and essentially he only admitted his negligence in supervising his staff, and he failed to perform due diligence.”）。此前趙曾數度於庭上提及自己沒有盡此責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問趙是否知任控方證人可減刑-趙先稱有責任協助作證-後同意有此可能性&quot;&gt;官問趙是否知任控方證人可減刑 趙先稱有責任協助作證 後同意有此可能性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢其後再入庭，Beel 遂向他指出辯方案情，指趙家賢嘗試在證供中，將他2020年的參與講到最低，同時渲染、怪責和誇大其他人的參與（embellished, blamed and exaggerated the involvement of others），甚至嘗試指其當事人為有偏見的新聞工作者，貶低她的聲譽，趙均不同意。Beel 再提及，趙有一個「可恥的希望（shameful hope）」，又指其供詞是「不誠實（deceitful）」，惟被陳慶偉打斷，着他不要加那些形容詞，李運騰亦說「我們不需帶任何情緒到這裡（“We don’t need any emotion here.”）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，趙這樣做是為了獲得較輕的刑期？趙不同意。李運騰續指，但趙知道透過認罪和任控方證人，他可獲得刑期扣減？又雙手張開笑說：「這是所有人都知道的。（“Everybody knows about that.”）」。趙答：「回應法官閣下，我有責任係去協助作證，係向法庭去將我所知嘅整個事件嘅情況去講述」，林卓廷發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李追問，那趙知道認罪會獲得減刑嗎？趙指「認罪減刑呢個知道嘅」，李再問，那是否知道向控方提供證據也會有減刑（“… you can expect some discount?”）？陳慶偉補充是「或會有減刑（may be entitled to some discount）」，庭內傳出笑聲，趙答「係，因為冇 guarantee（保證）嘅」。李問，但也會有這個希望？陳慶偉指是有「可能性」，趙答「有咁嘅機會」。Beel 再問，是這個可能性推動趙作供？質疑他不是誠實的證人。陳慶偉指可留待陳詞，Beel 續指發問完畢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9fQCyLT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第48天，趙家賢接受陳志全的代表大狀盤問。趙曾於口供提及，陳志全派代表出席首次新界東協調會議，惟庭上獲展示助手筆記後，改稱陳本人亦有出席。辯方今播放片段，指陳當晚正在數碼港為「D100」節目《人民主場》做直播，不可能出席會議，趙強調回想到陳志全與助手一同出現的畫面，但亦真誠確信辯方資料為真確，故只能回應「no comment」。辯方續指人人都會犯錯，有沒有可能是趙搞錯了？惟趙沒有正面回答，僅稱同意每人都有機會犯錯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙今在盤問下同意，2021年6月進行首次錄影會面時已願意協助警方調查；惟被問他是透過律師表示望任控方證人，抑或是由警方邀請，則據「法律專業保密特權」稱不願意作答，但確認有與警方討論，亦確認望獲額外減刑是錄口供的其中一個因素。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢同意陳志全為盡責理性議員從不視為本土抗爭派&quot;&gt;趙家賢同意陳志全為盡責理性議員、從不視為本土抗爭派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍的代表大狀早上完成盤問趙家賢，續由代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉盤問。被問何時認識陳志全，趙猶豫稱約於2012、13年，後同意於2012年陳當選立法會議員時認識他，而此前因陳於電台做節目、有「知名度」，已認知有他這個人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ThG2UvM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 陳志全（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問是否清楚陳的立場，趙指「不太確定」，但同意辯方指他是非常盡責（very conscientious）的議員，指從民主派和建制派議員均聽到該稱讚，也看到陳就一些法案或提問「係好有準備」。趙亦同意陳是理性的立法會議員，從來不視他為本土抗爭派，而是傳統民主派下的「進步民主派」。法官陳仲衡一度問，那趙會否視戴耀廷為本土抗爭派？庭上傳出笑聲。趙思索片刻未回答，馬補充即戴有時會表現為本土抗爭派？趙細聲答「係嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢多次追問下不記得何時表示擬認罪-翻查資料為2021年9月&quot;&gt;趙家賢多次追問下不記得何時表示擬認罪 翻查資料為2021年9月&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續就趙家賢2022年9月錄取首份證人供詞的背景發問。趙同意，他於2022年6月庭上閱讀案情摘要後認罪，而該份摘要早於同年2月已透過律師交予他。馬續問，趙是何時首次向律師表示擬認罪並同意本案案情？並提醒趙可因「法律專業保密特權（Legal Professional Privilege，LPP）」而不回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰將問題分拆，先問趙何時首次提出認罪意向？趙低頭思考。李追問是哪年哪月，趙思考約15秒答「2021年嘅時候」，馬問是年尾？並提到趙是於2021年3月1日首度提堂，問能否喚醒其記憶？趙再沉默約10秒。李追問是哪個季節？趙沉默數秒再稱：「抱歉我真係唔記得啦。」李再追問是年中抑或年尾，趙反問他是何時認罪，惟獲告知後仍未能回答。（翻查資料，趙於2021年9月23日的第二次提訊日，在庭上與區諾軒和鍾錦麟表明擬認罪。）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問是趙提出任控方證人抑或警察接觸-趙根據法律保密特權不願作答&quot;&gt;辯方問是趙提出任控方證人抑或警察接觸 趙根據法律保密特權不願作答&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後展示趙家賢2022年9月29日的首份「無損權益口供」，顯示於小欖精神病治療中心錄取。趙同意，該份口供是他還柙期間，警方探訪他「起碼6、7次」後錄取，但不太記得整個探訪橫跨多少時間，而整份口供連同附件有約1,800頁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續問，趙是透過律師表示願意任控方證人，抑或是由警察接觸他？法官陳慶偉即提醒，此問題牽涉「法律專業保密特權」，指趙和律師的對話受法律保障，除非他願意，否則並非一定要作答。趙低頭約5秒，續說：「多謝法官閣下，咁我根據返嗰個法律專業保密條例，根據返條條例，我就唔願意作答。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續問，警察曾否接觸並邀請趙任證人？趙答：「有討論。」李運騰問那趙首次表示願意錄取控方證人供詞時，他已經認罪了嗎？趙指「向警方提供時我未認罪嘅」，惟問法官指的口供是否指「NPS（Non-prejudicial statement，無損權益口供）」。李運騰確認，指並非談及錄影會面，而是證人供詞，又提醒趙不願意的話不用作答，趙沉默約10秒未有回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認於2021年6月進行首次錄影會面-同意當時已願意協助警方調查&quot;&gt;趙確認於2021年6月進行首次錄影會面 同意當時已願意協助警方調查&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉遂改問，趙是何時有意協助警方？趙表示，於2021年6、7月曾錄取兩份錄影會面記錄，「咁就住警方嘅調查我係願意提供所需嘅資訊」，同意即2021年時他已願意協助警方：「因為當時願意做個 VIR（應為 VRI，video-recorded interview），其實就係向警方提供訊息，咁當然係協助警方去做個調查。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指出，當趙進行錄影會面，只是作為被告（suspect）提供資料，但當他錄取「無損權益口供」，就是作為潛在證人（potential witness）提供資料，指兩者完全不同，趙表示明白。陳慶偉再指，趙可在午飯時思考到底他何時表示有意成為控方證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙離開法庭後，陳慶偉問馬維騉上述盤問的目的是什麼？馬指趙作為控方證人，表明會盡力作出真確的供詞，惟其供詞的說法卻與庭上證供不符。陳問若是如此，為何需要知道趙何時認罪和同意成為控方證人？馬維騉指那些議題對他來說不重要。陳再問既然不重要又為何要問，馬稱只是想為提問建立基礎，不知會花這麼多時間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指為獲額外減刑故錄口供-趙稱我諗思維上係其中一個因素&quot;&gt;辯方指為獲額外減刑故錄口供 趙稱「我諗思維上係其中一個因素」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢午飯後確認，在錄取「無損權益口供」時已經認罪及同意案情。馬維騉續問，毫無疑問，趙錄取這份口供是希望獲得額外減刑？趙回應：「我諗當時思維上依個係其中一個因素。」馬續指，相信趙落口供時亦想到《國安法》第33條，即自動放棄犯罪、自動投案或揭發他人犯罪行為可減刑的條文，趙指於2020年7月14日，區諾軒已向他提及過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡着辯方直接問重點，馬維騉遂問，因為趙望能獲接納成為控方證人，故會盡力向警方提供他所知的資訊？趙稱：「我作為願意去作證，當然要盡力將我所知嘅去協助法庭同埋警方去調查案件」，但認為辯方問題前句指他希望可獲接納為證人是有「前設」，「我就唔係太同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙口供稱陳志全由代表出席協調會-惟庭上看助手筆記後改口&quot;&gt;趙口供稱陳志全由代表出席協調會 惟庭上看助手筆記後改口&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後展示口供並就此發問，當中趙提及2020年5月5日新東第二次協調會議的出席者和情況，列明陳志全是由助理代表出席。馬維騉指趙早前已稱其口供出錯，他應只曾出席4月14日的第一次新東會議；趙並同意就當天會上的情況，已經將他所聽所見說出。馬續問，趙稱陳志全由代表出席會議，是來自他的記憶？趙稱：「當時錄口供嘅時候係」，並同意庭上曾獲展示助手黎敬輝就該次會議的筆記，顯示陳本人亦有出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問到，在錄口供期間警方有沒有向趙展示黎的筆記？趙指是「好大量嘅文件」，「有啲位我有睇」，但當時或未有好確切看清楚而有此「誤會」，後確認是不記得。陳仲衡再問，趙只是依賴黎的筆記才回答陳志全有出席會議，還是筆記喚起他的記憶？趙稱是後者。馬維騉其後引趙供詞，提及警方向他展示「附件十六」共674頁，確認該些文件是他與黎敬輝的 WhatsApp 對話，又列出黎向他報告各區會議出席人士和對話內容所屬的訊息號碼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙補充指錄口供時只是不確認陳志全有否出席-故警方建議只寫由代表出席&quot;&gt;趙補充指錄口供時只是不確認陳志全有否出席 故警方建議只寫由代表出席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後展示黎敬輝的筆記，顯示就當天出席者名單包括「慢必 蘇浩」。馬續指出，趙過份依賴（over-rely）黎的筆記，當他的記憶與筆記有出入時，就選擇依賴筆記；李運騰亦追問趙稱陳志全有出席會議是否錯誤，趙不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙其後再確認，是控方主問時閱讀筆記才記起陳志全亦在場。馬質疑已事隔3年，趙續指有「少少想補充返」，表示錄首份口供被警方問及陳志全有否親自出席會議時，「我記得蘇浩係有出席嘅，但當時我記憶呢，我唔係確認只係得佢一個出席，我只係唔係好確認陳志全係有冇出席⋯⋯因為咁嘅關係，警方就同我講因為白紙黑字，就話係陳志全嘅代表啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指陳志全正為d100節目直播故不可能開會-趙no-comment&quot;&gt;辯方指陳志全正為「D100」節目直播故不可能開會 趙：no comment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後播放陳志全主持「D100」電台節目《人民主場》的片段，片頭顯示「主持：陳志全（慢必）、譚得志（快必）」，其後兩人露面，畫面寫有節目是逢星期二晚7時半至8時半播放。馬問趙有否留意這個節目，他稱「抱歉唔知道」，又指知道陳有在網台「開咪」，但不知道是「D100」的節目、亦不知節目名，亦不知道是上述時間直播。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續播放陳志全4月14日（新東會議當晚）主持《人民主場》的片段，顯示陳報時稱現在是晚上7時35分，並稱：「正如我今日開記者會嘅時候同香港人講，呢個係一個⋯⋯」馬指出，陳志全根本不可能出席同日晚上7至9時於旺角舉行的新東首次協調會議，因他當時正在數碼港進行直播節目，並問這會否動搖趙稱陳有出席該會議的記憶。趙思考逾半分鐘，延伸庭有被告模仿趙笑稱「抱歉法官閣下，我唔記得」，黃之鋒發笑，鄒家成和吳政亨也笑着做打圈手勢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙其後回答：「馬大狀或者我咁嘅回應，因為當我有回想到蘇浩同陳志全呢，喺教協個會議室有出現嘅畫面，而我都真誠地確信你提供嘅呢啲資料係真確，所以我只可以對你嘅提問作出嘅回應係 no comment。」 這時多名被告及旁聽人士大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，所以趙是記得陳於會議當晚在場，但解釋不到為何他似乎又在另一個地方主持節目？趙答「係」，多人再發笑，被告席傳來「嘩」。趙續同意辯方指，他在錄口供時清楚記得蘇浩而非陳志全在場，惟讀過黎敬輝的筆記後，「回想返」印象有改變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑辯方如何證明節目是直播-辯方稱會盡力找不在場證據包括cctv&quot;&gt;官質疑辯方如何證明節目是直播 辯方稱會盡力找不在場證據包括CCTV&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後質疑，辯方現時是以該片段挑戰趙的記憶，但如何證明陳志全主持的節目時間是真確的？李運騰亦指辯方需就此提供證據，否則只屬傳聞證供。法官其後要求趙家賢避席，問辯方有否任何證據，馬維騉表示是來自陳志全的指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉追問有沒有其他證據，陳仲衡亦問如何證明節目是逢星期二晚直播。馬表示，此前的控方案情包括區諾軒證供，均指陳志全兩次協調會議都沒有出席，是直至趙家賢供稱陳志全有出席後，他才開始收集陳的不在場證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，會向「D100」的職員查詢能否取得有關證據，以及向數碼港查詢能否提供停車場的閉路電視片段。陳仲衡指現已事隔兩年，馬則回應望法庭明白其困難，重申趙的供詞亦指陳是派代表出席，他沒預想過會有這樣的情況出現，重申會盡力找出證據證明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱無印象陳志全於會上發言-強調聽到有人攻擊民主動力會豎起隻耳仔&quot;&gt;趙稱無印象陳志全於會上發言 強調聽到有人攻擊民主動力會「豎起隻耳仔」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續確認，在4月14日會議當晚遲到，並曾於晚上7時19分向黎敬輝發訊息指因區議會會議遲了，現正搭的士來。趙解釋，當時在西灣河東區法院出席完區議會會議，遂搭的士前往旺角中僑大廈教協會址的新東會議。李運騰追問是否經東區海底隧道，趙思考數秒後回答「係」，有被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡問訊息有否喚起（ring the bell）趙到達會議的印象，李運騰亦問最後他是否有成功到達，趙笑言「有」，並因交通擠塞故8時左右到達，並在會議逗留了約一小時，期間使用電腦處理公務。馬問他是否不時留意戴耀廷有否「亂講嘢」？趙表示：「未必淨係佢嘅，會有啲與會者會係攻擊吓民主動力係咪大台呀，喺度欺壓啲素人呀，當聽到民主動力嘅嘢咁我都會豎起隻耳仔。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，黎的筆記沒有提及陳志全或蘇浩有在會上發言，趙表示：「我冇乜太大印象。」馬續指出，他沒有印象是因陳志全根本沒有出席會議，趙不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方展示片段-指陳志全第二次新東會議期間亦主持電台節目&quot;&gt;辯方展示片段 指陳志全第二次新東會議期間亦主持電台節目&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於5月5日第二次新東會議同為星期二，馬維騉其後再播放當晚陳志全主持《人民主場》的片段，陳報時稱現在是晚上7時40分，趙重申不知道有此節目。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬最後指，趙稱陳志全有出席4月14日會議，而黎敬輝筆記提及陳和蘇浩一同出席，問趙是否可能搞錯了？他並指這對其當事人來說是很重要的問題。趙望着傳譯主任的電腦螢幕沉默逾半分鐘答：「馬大狀我知道係重要嘅問題，但係我好清楚喺個法庭度都講，係喺我回想返當中，喺蘇浩隔離，陳志全係一齊喺教協個位置係有出現」，又指因他向法庭作證，「我只可以將我所知、我最準確知道嘅嘢講出嚟。」陳志全皺眉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問趙有否可能搞錯-趙無正面回答僅同意每人都有機會犯錯&quot;&gt;辯方問趙有否可能搞錯 趙無正面回答、僅同意每人都有機會犯錯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，人人都會犯錯，有沒有可能是趙搞錯了？趙只是答：「每個人喺唔同時候都有機會犯錯嘅，呢個我同意。」陳慶偉問，所以趙遇到陳志全一定是在4月14日或5月5日的會議，除非他因為其他原因到旺角，陳志全、彭卓棋和柯耀林等發笑。趙同意，並重申只記得陳有出席首次會議，李運騰指認為繼續問下去也沒什麼意義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬再指出，陳志全兩次會議均沒有出席，陳慶偉問趙同意嗎？趙答：「回應法官閣下，喺我頭先所講，我能夠回想我覺得最準確嘅認知底下，我只能夠答不同意。」案件下周一（24日）10時半後續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，早上完成盤問的何桂藍代表大狀 Trevor Beel，下午因身體不適未有到庭。近日多名被告和律師團隊不適，黃碧雲和梁國雄不時咳嗽，何桂藍亦抹鼻涕。散庭後，旁聽的陳皓桓向被告揮手大喊：「保重身體！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aERufUi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（19日）踏入審訊第47天。對民主動力帖文提及「對抗暴政」，趙家賢曾稱絕非民動立場，昨又表示自己不會使用該字眼。代表何桂藍的大狀 Trevor Beel 今引不同文件質疑，其中趙家賢2019年11月被咬耳後透過民動發出的公告亦提及「對抗暴政」，惟趙指「嗰陣時我喺醫院瞓咗係度」。法官問辯方用意，Beel 指是質疑趙家賢可信性，法官一度提醒或有反效果，指其當事人亦有參與民動組織的初選，亦可能會擴闊「共謀者原則」範圍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙家賢強調民動於2020年5月中下旬才答應辦初選，惟辯方展示文件，顯示趙2月曾與戴耀廷、區諾軒等人開會討論初選。趙強調該次僅屬「初步交流」，而助手筆記提及「操作：民動」亦只是提議非決議。他又指答應承辦初選時無簽文件，承認是「罪責、錯誤」，指民主派好多工作「講個信字」；亦絕不同意辯方指，他稱若知道戴耀廷文章就不會承辦初選的說法是虛構。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;受襲後於工作報告提及對抗暴政趙表示非自己寫我喺醫院瞓咗係度&quot;&gt;受襲後於工作報告提及「對抗暴政」趙表示非自己寫：我喺醫院瞓咗係度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢續接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問。趙昨在盤問下表示，他不會使用「對抗暴政」的字眼。Beel 續引民主動力2018年11月至2020年12月的工作報告，提到趙家賢在太古城中心外遭咬耳後，於2019年11月4日發出新聞公告，表示：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「對昨日發生極端親政府兇徒襲擊包括其本人在內的太古城居民及市民，感到極為震驚就憤慨…趙家賢已完成手術，仍需觀察及休養，暫時未知何時出院…趙家賢呼籲所有民主派區議會候選人、太古城居民及香港市民，要謹慎保護自身安全，並重申在面對親政府陣營的暴力威嚇，絕不屈服退縮；團結一致，堅持到底，對抗暴政。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問到上述內容是否由趙家賢撰寫，還是由其助手黎敬輝所寫，趙稱：「回應辯方律師，嗰陣時我喺醫院瞓咗係度」。Beel 追問，故內容並非由趙所寫？趙大聲稱：「我已經回答咗，我當時喺醫院做完手術，睇下駁唔駁得返隻耳，仲喺醫院度休養緊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙承認無檢查職員起草的報告-再強調我最終要負責&quot;&gt;趙承認無檢查職員起草的報告 再強調：我最終要負責&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問，雖然並非他撰寫，但他是民主動力的召集人，而這份是工作報告，故他必定採納當中的內容？趙表示之前已講解過民主動力工作報告的草擬模式，是由職員所撰寫，包括總幹事黎敬輝及兼職職員。陳表示明白其做法是根據時序，趙補充，職員會根據時序抽取 Facebook 聲明的內容，再擺放在報告之中；當趙知道黎敬輝的做法和方向後，就沒有再仔細檢視他起草的工作報告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙亦再次重申：「當然我都係喺呢個法庭度，我已經多次講我作為民主動力嘅召集人，最終要負責任，所有關於民主動力嘅事情我一定最終要負責，呢個我講得好清楚。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方欲質疑趙家賢可信性-官一度提醒或有反效果&quot;&gt;辯方欲質疑趙家賢可信性 官一度提醒或有反效果&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰打斷問 Beel，這件事是2019年發生，到底他想問的是甚麼？Beel 表示，他想知道民主動力的政治立場，因趙早前稱帖文中提及「光復議會」、「對抗暴政」絕對並非民動的立場，但事實上民動在2019年及2020年常用到上述字眼，與趙的供詞並不相符。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續質疑，即使民動立場是「對抗暴政」，這如何協助辯方案情，Beel 指他會質疑趙證供的可信性，指趙的說法虛構、沒有說出全部真相。李提醒 Beel 的做法可能會產生反效果（backfire），並要求趙避席。李續指，法庭現時就此沒有看法，但提醒 Beel 的當事人也有參與由民動所組織的初選，若辯方指民動有堅定的政治立場，或需思考相關盤問引申的含義；又強調不是要阻止辯方盤問，法庭亦願接受辯方游說（open to persuasion）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡則補充，若辯方是指民動的立場與工作報告一致，而民動一直都是知情並願意參與「35+」，或會擴大本案「共謀者原則」（co-conspirator’s rule）應用的範圍。Beel 重申只是質疑證人的可信性，又指要先證明串謀存在，上述原則才適用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;工作報告提及共抗暴政-趙稱無民動執委成員提反對&quot;&gt;工作報告提及「共抗暴政」 趙稱無民動執委成員提反對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後續引民動工作報告，提及在2019年11月17日，民主動力邀請立法會議員及民主派區議會候選人，在愛丁堡廣場舉行造勢大會，展示團結，以區議會選舉作變相公投「五大訴求，一起公投」為共同政綱，「一同於社區推動及鼓勵市民投票，共抗暴政」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指，報告時間為2018年11月至2020年12月，趙當時如對用字有任何不滿意，是否可作出修改？趙低頭說：「我啱啱離開之前我已經作答咗」，強調就工作報告他沒有仔細看，只是「䁽吓」。陳仲衡問，但大會上有沒有出席人士叫喊「共抗暴政」？趙再低頭說：「回應法官閣下，我並不知道，我當時喺東區醫院。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在李運騰提問下，趙確認該工作報告曾呈交予執委會，亦應該有向執委會成員展示；亦同意出席的成員會收到報告，而職員曾稱稍後會發送電子版本予缺席者。趙表示超過一半的執委會成員出席才可舉行會議，而會上沒有成員就報告提及的民動立場提出反對，「大家收到份嘢都係䁽吓眼。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉一度，趙曾指職員是據時序寫報告，但為何當中提及2020年5月的事情後，又會再返回2019年5月？趙表示報告的整理方式是由職員向他講解，而有關工作敘述的段落大致都是順時序，但「唔知係咪攝入錯咗，定時序錯咗」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方引眾籌頁面提光時-趙重申由總幹事處理&quot;&gt;辯方引眾籌頁面提「光時」 趙重申由總幹事處理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再展示民主動力的眾籌文件，當中「公民投票背景」提及「暴政又於今年加推國歌法、國安法，對港人的輾壓施暴變本加厲⋯不同戰線繼續努力，才可擺脫極權魔爪，建立民主制度⋯合計過半，才可光復立法會，奪回控制權，壓制港共政權，再繼而改革政制，建立民主政府。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文件亦提及「我們能滴水穿石，共同盡最大的努力打破缺口，創建未來。我們亦已無身後路。我們需要你的支持，若能成功，光復香港時代革命便不再只是一句口號。我們需要重奪立法會，香港才能浴火重生」等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，民主動力負責為初選眾籌。被問頁面是否由民動設計，趙重申因他不熟悉眾籌平台運作，故相關行政工作全由總幹事黎幹事處理，他事後亦認為「出咗事」；又指警方應是根據《國安法》要求黎敬輝提供資料，黎遂提供編輯眾籌頁面的非公開版面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙重申民動於5月中下旬始承辦初選-辯方引黎敬輝記錄指趙2月曾出席九東會議&quot;&gt;趙重申民動於5月中下旬始承辦初選 辯方引黎敬輝記錄指趙2月曾出席九東會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;眾籌頁面亦提及「35+計劃」的時間表，指2020年3月「戴耀廷副教授及前立法會議員區諾軒作主導，民主動力協助，與18區區議會民主派主席、副主席及民選議員，以及民主派人士進行協調會議，商討立法會選舉的協調安排」。就民動於3月已「協助」初選，趙再重申是於5月中下旬才同意承辦，而3月中則是獲邀列席會議進行經驗分享，而因為該句「唔係一個好長嘅句子」，故稱民動的角色是「協助」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟 Beel 指，事實上趙家賢早於2月10日已被邀請出席一次九龍東會議並討論初選，問那是否他第一次參與「35+」的工作？趙指該次並非協調會議。此前審訊從未提及該次會議，Beel 續展示趙家賢與黎敬輝的 WhatsApp 紀錄，顯示黎為該會議記下的筆記，趙以約1至2分鐘閱讀。Beel 問有否喚醒趙的記憶，趙重申記得有會議進行，但並非協調會。Beel 指該會議是為初選協調的準備、是所有事情的源起（genesis），陳慶偉問趙是否接受該說法？趙靜默約5秒後稱「唔接受」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認蔡澤鴻邀請出席6人會議會上無潛在參選人-強調屬初步交流&quot;&gt;趙確認蔡澤鴻邀請出席6人會議、會上無潛在參選人 強調屬「初步交流」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續向趙指，辯方是指出其案情，就是民主動力在「35+計劃」的參與是更早發生。趙沒有直接回答，僅指記錄當然清楚顯示當時曾討論初選的技術細節等，而他記得戴當時提及有一間西班牙IT公司，有技術確保投票時伺服器不會被「殭屍電腦」「炸機」，並打算找該機構協助初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻曾向他表示：「戴耀廷約左我哋去傾喎，你都嚟埋啦，你知戴耀廷、戴妖㗎啦，又唔知佢咩葫蘆賣咩藥，我哋咁耐嚟講做開協調都係信民主動力㗎啦，咁梗係搵埋阿趙你，搵埋你嚟聽個會」。趙家賢提及「戴妖」時，多人發笑，余慧明掩面，法庭傳譯主任譯為「Monster Tai」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，是蔡澤鴻邀他出席該次會議，亦確認筆記指出席者包括趙家賢、蔡澤鴻、時任黃大仙區議會副主席黃逸旭、區諾軒、戴耀延及黎敬輝。李運騰問，因此會議是由計劃最初的組織者，或之後成為組織者的人出席？趙未有直接回答，僅指因九東是最小的選區，故戴耀廷望先在該區商討初選，再一步步擴至其他區。李再問，即會議只有上述6人出席，沒有其他潛在參選人？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，雖然會議是有關九龍東，但事實上會上亦談及九東以外的事情？趙再指戴當時約了九東的區議會正副主席，有如「我準備傾初選，就嚟探吓路、拜吓啲地保」，蔡澤鴻並着他看看戴耀廷有何想法。李運騰打斷指不是談及蔡澤鴻的角色，指筆記提及新西、新東、九西、港島等，問會上的議題是否涉九龍東以外的選區？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，故會議是一個做準備的會議？陳慶偉亦問即是初步（preliminary）的會議？趙答：「我同意陳仲衡法官所講，係 preliminary ，但係一個 exchange」，意指即「初步交流」而非「初步會議」。陳慶偉即笑着指住左邊的陳仲衡，指「他才是陳仲衡（“He is Johnny Chan.”）」，多人發笑，法庭職員着旁聽席「靜啲」，趙家賢輕聲說「sorry」。Beel 則笑言，趙家賢一直都沒有稱呼他的名字，只是叫他做「大狀」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;筆記提操作民動-趙強調只是提議非決定&quot;&gt;筆記提「操作：民動」 趙強調只是提議非決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，為何黎敬輝會做此記錄？趙指應該是他叫黎記錄會上重點。此前趙曾稱因在新東會上就運用否決權用字有爭議時在場，故着黎不用記錄，Beel 續問：「即使你當時在場和知道發生什麼事（仍叫黎做記錄）？」，惟陳慶偉以「Thank you, thank you.」打斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續展示記錄提及：「操作：民動；民調：鍾庭耀；倡議人＋平台」，問民主動力是否初選的操作者？趙低頭思考一會，解釋「應該係戴耀廷同我講當時佢有希望民主動力幫手」，但再稱「好記得」戴有提及要找西班牙IT公司做投票系統。惟陳慶偉再打斷，指筆記表面上是否顯示民主動力就是初選操作人，趙答：「應該係，所以我個助手先會咁樣做記錄。」李運騰問，當時是提議找民主動力幫手，抑或已決定由民動幫手？趙指「依個冇決議」，重申是「戴耀廷做協調之前嘅探路、拜地保嘅做法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱答應承辦初選時無簽文件屬錯誤大家工作都係講個信字&quot;&gt;趙稱答應承辦初選時無簽文件屬錯誤：大家工作都係講個信字&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後再問及民主動力獲邀請和答應承辦初選的日期，趙稱是5月初左右收到邀請，直至5月中至中下旬才確認承辦。Beel 追問，趙早前稱民動在5月20日後才答應承辦，他是否記得正式日子？趙稱：「正式日子我唔記得」。法官陳仲衡再問民動答應承辦時有沒有簽署任何文件，趙表示：「抱歉法官閣下，呢度我都要承認係其中一個罪責、錯誤之一；因為過往咁耐，民主派有好多工作大家都係講個信字去處理」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾稱若知道戴的文章不會答應承辦初選-趙否認是虛構&quot;&gt;曾稱若知道戴的文章不會答應承辦初選 趙否認是虛構&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指出，民主動力實質上只獲邀做眾籌工作，最後亦只答應負責這方面，趙不同意。Beel 亦問，民主動力答應承辦的日子是重要事項，指趙稱5月才答應承辦初選是虛構的，惟陳慶偉均不批准發問。Beel 再問，趙稱若他知道戴耀廷的文章，就不會答應承辦初選，這個說法也是虛構，趙迅速回答：「extremely disagree（極不同意）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑口供無提及哪日答應承辦初選-趙反問你想我答啲乜嘢&quot;&gt;辯方質疑口供無提及哪日答應承辦初選 趙反問：你想我答啲乜嘢？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問趙，在他向警方錄取的4份口供之中，均沒有提及民主動力在5月哪一日開始承辦初選，趙反問：「你想我答啲乜嘢呀？」，這時黃之鋒「O嘴」，林卓廷發笑。陳慶偉將問題重複一次，趙思考數秒後表示：「法官閣下，我唔係好…」。 法官再指，即趙從沒告訴警察在哪日正式答應承辦初選，並告訴趙可以答同意、不同意或不記得，陳慶偉補充不是記憶測試。趙最後回答：「唔記得」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙否認記錯戴耀廷要求預留款項用途-稱戴總之想喺民主動力度chur返起碼80萬&quot;&gt;趙否認記錯戴耀廷要求預留款項用途 稱戴「總之想喺民主動力度chur返起碼80萬」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，Beel 今亦再問及民主動力的捐款。趙確認，戴耀廷於2020年8月底、9月初要求民動捐超過80萬予香港民研以收集對反對預算案的意見，他終建議捐40萬，但因執委會換屆未有處理，至被捕後銀行戶口亦被凍結。惟 Beel 展示趙家賢供詞，曾指戴耀廷是在2020年7月底向他談及就否決預算案設投票系統一事，又指戴預計初選結果於立會選舉延期後仍有效，望在2021年選舉前再進行民意調查。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 亦引訊息，其中戴耀廷在10月1日曾向趙發訊息稱：「Ben 告訴我民動會把錢捐給獨媒下的慈善機構，那筆錢大概會有多少？還有能確實可以給民意研究所的數目嗎？」，6日後又問「民意研究所想確知已籌的錢是否已把 800K 預先預備了作下年選前民調之用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指出，事實上趙家賢搞錯了，戴耀廷要求他預留的款項只是用作下一次選舉的選前民調，而非用來開發就否決財案向泛民施壓的投票系統。趙指「我冇搞亂到」，重申因「唔想民主動力再牽涉喺戴耀廷提出嘅呢啲項目當中，但一路上就覺得點樣都應該有一筆錢捐比香港民研」，故如調解員般提議「中間方案」，即捐無指定用途的40萬予民研，戴就「唔會話民主動力食咗嚿錢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，當時建議捐50萬予獨媒下做傳媒教育工作的慈善組織，及40萬予香港民研；而戴本身預計應可從民動拿到起碼80萬以上推動其項目，得知此消息後就以另一方法問民動有否預留80萬，「即係佢其實心目中總之都想喺民主動力度 chur 返起碼80萬嘅數額，嚟畀佢畀香港民意研究所做佢嘅研究」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指，此前就此完全無任何提問，「因為對個案情嚟講都講得太遠」，故他無特別解釋；而現在望透過其講解能令辯方和法官知道他並非「搞亂咗」，「你會見到戴耀廷其實係咁 chur 住人⋯」，但遭 Beel 打斷。趙其後亦承認供詞提到戴7月底談及開發系統的日期是記錯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指戴不信參選人有共識否決財案-趙不同意-稱只是認為泛民可能褪軚&quot;&gt;辯方指戴不信參選人有共識否決財案 趙不同意 稱只是認為泛民可能「褪軚」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 最後問，根據趙與戴的對話，戴耀廷是否其實知道參選人沒有真正的共識？法官多番要求澄清問題字眼，Beel 解釋即戴知道民主派雖表面上似乎有共識（consensus for public consumption），但私下其實沒有共識。法官陳慶偉認為問題太複雜，改問從戴耀廷的說話，趙是否知道戴自己也不真誠相信，候選人之間有共識入立會後會否決財案？趙答：「我唔係咁嘅睇法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰改問，趙提及戴望以民調影響傳統民主派否決預算案，而從二人對話，趙是否知道戴耀廷不相信傳統民主派在沒有壓力施加下會否決預算案？簡單而言，即戴耀廷是否不相信傳統民主派？趙回應，「我諗佢當時嘅思想會有『不相信』依個其中一個因素喺當中，而我嘅理解佢唔係覺得大家冇共識喺度，係會覺得傳統民主派可能去到嗰個位置嘅時候會自己褪軚。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李問，即戴認為傳統民主派未必會堅定遵守協議？趙指，因事情進展可能有很多變數，故戴希望有民意調查，「反映到民意嘅時候就令到傳統民主派冇顧慮啦。」陳慶偉總結，即趙不同意 Beel 的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IUc5f35.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（20日）踏入審訊第47天。代表何桂藍的大狀今早展示趙家賢個人 Facebook 帖文，提及「#香港正式進入準戰爭狀態」及「#香港人反抗」等，質疑趙並非聲稱般溫和，惟趙稱不記得有這些帖文。法官李運騰問帖文是否顯示趙為本土抗爭派，引起多人大笑，趙指「我自己都覺得好詫異」，指當時政局的情緒是「躁動」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過趙在午飯後主動提及，因「本身個腦嘅 memory 用晒喺案情」，休息後才回想起2019年8月因指示太古站示威者離開後有人被捕，被「深黃」居民指控「送人頭」並遭網上欺凌，續聘請價值觀較本土的居民協助管理 Facebook，指有關帖文應是由他所撰，強調對帖文「真係完全無任何印象」。此外，因有被告不適，審訊今提早完結，據了解是何桂藍感到不適。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙fb帖文稱一國兩制名存實亡及香港人反抗-遭質疑唔係你扮得咁溫和&quot;&gt;趙FB帖文稱「一國兩制名存實亡」及「香港人反抗」 遭質疑「唔係你扮得咁溫和」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢續接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問。Beel 今早質疑趙曾稱「對抗暴政」非民動立場，民主動力工作報告卻提及相關字眼，他其後再展示趙的個人Facebook「Andrew Chiu（趙家賢）」， 其封面相片顯示他左耳被包紮，並面露微笑舉起「五一」手勢，旁邊有一張黃色海報，印有寫着「香港人」的PEPE圖案，以及底部寫着「五大訴求，缺一不可」。延伸庭的黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒看到後不禁大聲發笑，正庭亦有被告和旁聽人士發笑。趙確認這是其 Facebook 專頁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續展示趙於2020年5月21日一則帖文，提及：「#一國兩制名存實亡 - 基本法二十三條必須本地立法，中共就透過港區人大提出附件三全國性法律引入香港版國家安全法，貫徹中共視法律如無物！ #長期抗爭 #毋忘初心。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他在3月26日的帖文則指：「好多保皇建制專業人士，經常以自身有英國專業資格為傲，但又要緊跟中共反殖原則以便攞盡著數。呢個反帝反殖港共政府又引用殖民地過時條例？五十年冇引用過！我好想知道呢批人會有咩反應！（＃自己 unfriend我啦！）#PK鄧報私仇 #打壓民選議會 #濫捕議長 #香港正式進入準戰爭狀態 #抗爭無退路！ #香港人反抗！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指出，上述內容看起來是抗爭派的帖文；陳慶偉問辯方想問甚麼，Beel 指趙不如他聲稱般溫和，陳續指這是趙的個人 Facebook 專頁，他可以發表他想表達的政見。李運騰續向趙笑指，辯方問題是「你唔係你扮得咁溫和？（“You are not moderate but you pretend to be?”）」，這時黃之鋒大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉再問，即在趙個人而言、而非民主動力，「你是非常激進嗎？」延伸庭的黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒及譚凱邦均大笑。陳再追問，從 Facebook 帖文看來，趙同意或不同意？這時朱凱迪笑言：「又 Luke Lai（助手黎敬輝）？」趙望着身旁傳譯主任的電腦螢幕約20秒，又低頭思考，終答「回應法官閣下，我諗緊其實我都唔記得我有啲咁嘅 post」。林卓廷大笑，余慧明亦發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問帖文是否顯示屬本土抗爭派-趙稱覺得好詫異並指當時情緒躁動&quot;&gt;官問帖文是否顯示屬本土抗爭派 趙稱「覺得好詫異」並指當時情緒躁動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問「如我說只看這些帖文，你是本土抗爭派，你有什麼回應？」，惹來哄堂大笑，何桂藍邊笑着邊舉起交叉手勢；黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒及譚凱邦均大笑。趙回應：「我諗在場嘅反應都已經覺得好詫異，我自己都覺得好詫異」，林卓廷聞言問：「唔係啩？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙一度稱帖文僅限朋友閱讀-林卓廷地球post嚟㗎喎&quot;&gt;趙一度稱帖文僅限朋友閱讀 林卓廷：地球post嚟㗎喎&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，「法官閣下我回想緊，係咪可能人有情緒，當時政局嘅情緒係躁動嘅」。陳慶偉指着帖文的情緒表達功能提及：「覺得盛怒（furious）」，並問「你當時覺得盛怒？，你是說這帖文並非你的原本性格（out of character）？」，趙回應：「我記得我自己嘅個人 Facebook account，只係局限於朋友嘅連結先睇到」，余慧明和何桂藍發笑，林卓廷說「地球 post 嚟㗎喎」，延伸庭的黃之鋒亦面露驚訝地指着螢幕與其他人討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問其意思是否指只限內部圈子（inner circle）才能看到。惟 Beel 打斷，指雖然他不是專家，但帖文有標記顯示是公開帖文，此時林卓廷和延伸庭的黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒及朱凱迪等均大笑，余慧明一度掩眼。趙家賢未有回答，陳慶偉追問：「你有回應嗎？抑或你想午飯後才回答？」趙最後表示：「其實我無掂個電話好耐。」Beel 最後指出，「對抗暴政」及「光復議會」均是趙家賢和民主動力的政治立場，趙答「不同意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙主動稱個腦嘅memory用晒喺案情-休息後回想為何有自己不會寫的帖文&quot;&gt;趙主動稱「個腦嘅memory用晒喺案情」 休息後回想為何有自己不會寫的帖文&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢於下午盤問期間，突然就有關帖文主動作出解釋，他稱：「因為當時我其實個腦嘅思考，只係就返本身喺法庭處理案情嘅一啲資料，包括民主動力嘅 Facebook⋯」，陳仲衡打斷並要求展示帖文。趙續指：「我確認頭先嗰個係我 Facebook 嘅 account 啦，但係辯方律師所展示畀我睇嘅嗰兩個貼文，我真係完全睇完之後冇印象，所以我睇完之後我係唔識答嘅」，他強調：「因為我本身個腦嘅 memory（記憶），就用晒喺案情本身嘅資料當中，咁所以經過稍作休息之後我回想返，點解會有啲自己唔會咁樣寫嘅 post 喺度呢？」林卓廷和鄒家成等失笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱被深黃居民網上欺凌19年助疏散太古站抗爭者卻被指送人頭&quot;&gt;趙稱被深黃居民網上欺凌、19年助疏散太古站抗爭者卻被指「送人頭」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙又指，現時回想，其個人 Facebook 帳戶除了自己私人用之外，「作為議員，都有陣時會認識到一啲區內嘅居民，都會加做朋友嘅。」他憶述2018年起被加在太古城、康怡及康山居民的「太古人太古事」Facebook 群組中，並不時會交流。但他其後發現，「我經常係畀一啲好深黃、或者係好本土意識嘅居民，就越嚟越有啲不禮貌或者係網上 bullying（欺凌）嘅情況。」延伸庭的黃之鋒、吳敏兒及朱凱迪大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，尤其是2019年8月11日，警方在太古站追捕抗爭者，並發射胡椒球彈，趙當時見站內多人，於是指示他們往某些出口疏散。但其後網上、連登及「太古人太古事」群組之中，有深黃居民及網民指控他，「話我叫啲人上咗地面之後，就即刻畀警察拉咗啦，喺度話我『送人頭』。」趙強調：「但係事實上呢，嗰啲示威者、抗爭者喺太古站上咗地面，就繼續喺電車站整路障堵路，過咗15分鐘之後啲警察先至到現場作執法行動」，這時黃之鋒驚訝地：「嘩！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱耳朵被咬後遭網民斥抵死-遂聘請價值觀較本土太古城居民&quot;&gt;趙稱耳朵被咬後遭網民斥抵死 遂聘請價值觀較本土太古城居民&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰打斷稱：「我不是不尊重你，但你可否用關鍵詞語總結？」被告席傳來笑聲。李續指：「我們對於那件事不感興趣，只是想知道為何你會發出此帖文，你是否想表達你的 Facebook 被入侵（hack）？」趙急忙表示：「法官閣下，知道！盡快，好快！」多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，該件事後，就算到了他的耳朵被咬受襲，「都繼續有呢啲深黃、本土嘅網民就繼續話我『抵死㗎！因為佢送人頭呀！』」，趙激動稱：「我當時真係完全唔明網上世界到底做乜鬼嘅！」被告席再度傳來笑聲。趙表示，因此其議辦聘請了太古城居民，是「價值觀相對較本土嘅21歲大學畢業生」。這時有被告驚訝地發出「嘩！」的聲音，亦有人說「又唔係佢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙重申對帖文真係完全無任何印象由他人代發&quot;&gt;趙重申對帖文「真係完全無任何印象」、由他人代發&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉打斷，故簡言之，趙聘請的這人就是帖文的作者？趙稱：「應該係，因為嗰兩個帖文我真係完全無任何印象」，不少被告面露詫異。趙亦同意陳指，該名居民可登入其 Facebook。李運騰則問到，帖文使用口語而非書面語，與趙的慣常做法有否不同，他稱：「唔太一致。」有被告不禁發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉最後問：「請原諒我，所以帖文提及『覺得盛怒』，你是指這個並非你的感受，而是你助理的感受嗎？」多名被告和旁聽人士發笑，黃之鋒及袁嘉蔚均掩嘴大笑，吳敏兒亦發笑。趙解釋發文時可以選擇以什麼圖像表達感覺，重申「所以我完全冇任何印象係我整呢啲貼文出嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後一度問，為何趙不刪除，惟陳慶偉不批准發問，Beel 再指，他的說法是「胡扯（nonsense）」，陳稱應留待陳詞交代。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方引民動工作報告-趙家賢曾獲民主黨通過出選區一&quot;&gt;辯方引民動工作報告 趙家賢曾獲民主黨通過出選「區一」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，辯方亦就「區議會（第一）功能組別」發問。Beel 展示民主動力工作報告，當中2020年7月23日的「民主動力召集人趙家賢就出選立法會區議會（第一）功能組別之聲明」，提及民主黨於前一日曾舉行黨內議員討論會，就趙家賢的提名及黨應否派員出選立法會區議會（第一）功能界別進行投票，最終，「趙個人信任票獲得通過，但黨內就應否派代表出選未有明顯共識，中委會授權的小組在參考黨內議員投票意向後作出決定，民主黨將不會派員出選區（一），召集人趙家賢感謝一眾黨友、政界友好，太古城社區及香港市民的信任，鼓勵及支持本人出戰立會，趙家賢會繼續堅守崗位，為香港搏盡。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，在立法會選舉宣布延期前，趙是否願意成為「35+」候選人之一？法官李運騰打斷，指「區議會（第二）功能組別（超級區議會）」與「區議會（第一）功能組別」完全不同。Beel 再問無論如何，趙是獨立參選抑或參與「35+計劃」？趙回應因他是民主黨黨員，故想出選要先尋求黨內通過；而雖然通過了黨內信任票，但就民主黨應否參與該界別選舉，則不獲通過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指民主黨不派員出選區一-因有人認為已被攻擊得好犀利應支持工黨&quot;&gt;趙指民主黨不派員出選「區一」 因有人認為已被攻擊得「好犀利」、應支持工黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在法官李運騰詢問下解釋，「區一」是由全港區議員互選產生的立法會議員議席，「區二」則需先獲足夠民選區議員提名，再開放予全港選民投票。被問民主黨為何不派人出選「區一」，趙指他並非民主黨中央委員，不清楚他們的討論，但在投票前的交流會上，李永達太太、屯門區議會主席陳樹英曾向黨友游說指「我支持家賢係一個好好嘅議員」，但認為就當時政局或應支持友黨「工黨」派人出選，因工黨當時議席已很少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指「呢個就係我自己作為黨員聽落去覺得好詫異嘅一樣嘢」，又指當時有部分黨友和同事認為，因「民主黨嘅保守溫和嘅取態已經畀本土抗爭派攻擊得好犀利」，若在選舉中嘗試爭取更多議席，反會影響地區直選的選情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問區一是否屬35計劃-趙從來未曾提過&quot;&gt;辯方問「區一」是否屬「35+計劃」 趙：從來未曾提過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，那「區一」是否包括在「35+計劃」內？趙指「從來未曾提過」。李續指，趙家賢接受了黨內提名他參選「區一」，那他是否有意作為候選人參加「35+」？趙未有直接回答，僅指他作為民動召集人，因曾做區議會選舉協調工作，認識港九新界各區很多議員，而因為該崗位，他是合適參與區議員業界代表的議席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李再追問，即與「35+計劃」有關嗎？趙指「我只可以講如果選得到嘅話，咪會喺立法會裡面民主派就會多一個席位，但就同返本案講緊嘅35+項目、『35+計劃』呢個 project 就唔係嗰回事」，此時林卓廷笑着望向鄒家成，施德來搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問區一是否計算35目標議席內-趙稱視乎計法&quot;&gt;被問「區一」是否計算「35+」目標議席內 趙稱視乎計法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問及「35+」的目標議席，趙同意「6 6 4 4 3」是地方選區目標，功能組別則需取得13席。Beel 問，趙意思是功能組別的目標議席並沒有計算「區一」在內？趙答：「睇吓唔同計法，可能有啲講法計，有啲講法唔計」，林卓廷說「嘩」。Beel 再問即是否包括「區一」，趙沒有直接回答，指「淨係好記得講傳統功能組別」，如會計界、法律界、IT界、社會福利界和一些想爭取的新界別，如發零售界和進出口界，陳志全發笑。趙續指：「我只可以講我唔能夠確認佢有冇特別去提包括埋呢個『區議會一』呢個組別。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，但考慮到2019年民主派在區議會選舉大勝，幾乎可以肯定民主派會贏得「區一」議席？趙指「係，冇錯法官閣下，個數據上係咁」，並指因此該聲明發出後一兩日，大約有7個民主派區議員進行交流會，想參選「區一」。李運騰問，與「35+」有關嗎？趙指：「法官閣下，喺我個思維係冇嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;小休期間，法庭職員稱由於有被告不適，因此案件押後至明天繼續，最後提早於3時50分散庭。據了解是何桂藍感到不適。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（19日）踏入審訊第46天。趙家賢今接受代表何桂藍的大狀盤問，形容與戴耀廷的關係「好複雜」，「絕對不會」視對方為親密朋友，又認為戴為他的工作製造很多困難，一度同意感覺他是「麻煩製造者」。被問趙是否對戴感到不滿，怪責戴令他有今時今日的困境，趙起初稱沒有怪責，指自己作供只是為協助法庭處理案件；但在法官追問下承認「當然我係一個人啦，係有情緒嘅」、「對於戴耀廷嘅感覺係有嘅」，承認對戴有感到不滿，才會稱呼他為「大思想家、大學者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙家賢指何桂藍2018年在九西和新東補選初選後曾以《立場新聞》記者身分邀約他受訪，惟因趙感覺何「唔係好支持個初選」，故向《立場》反映望換人，終由另一記者訪問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱何桂藍2018年曾以立場記者身分就初選約訪-惟趙提出換人&quot;&gt;趙稱何桂藍2018年曾以《立場》記者身分就初選約訪 惟趙提出換人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢今開始接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問。趙家賢同意，他個人並不認識何桂藍。被問是否從沒有與她談話，趙指在2018年頭，民主派九龍西和新界東補選初選完結後，何桂藍曾以《立場新聞》記者身分在某個集會「嚟搵我講咗幾句」，想就初選與他進行訪問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟趙指，當時何予他的感覺「其實唔係好支持個初選」，故他與《立場》另一名資深記者反映「如果你哋想訪問我，可唔可以派另一個記者嚟」，林卓廷、鄒家成、余慧明等發笑，何桂藍則沒有特別反應，繼續使用電腦。趙續指，故當時與何「傾咗幾下後就冇接觸」，《立場》亦派了另一個記者與他做訪問，此外便不曾與何有接觸和對話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指絕對不會視戴耀廷為親密朋友戴令其工作變得困難&quot;&gt;趙指絕對不會視戴耀廷為親密朋友、戴令其工作變得困難&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續就戴耀廷發問。趙同意，他於2012年開始認識戴耀廷。Beel 問他會如何形容與戴自2016年至2019年的關係，趙答「好複雜」。在延伸庭的黃之鋒、吳敏兒及袁嘉蔚均發笑。Beel 問，會否視戴為親密朋友（close friend）？趙指「絕對不會」。吳敏兒及袁嘉蔚聞後再發笑。Beel 再問，趙尊重戴嗎？法官李運騰問是作為人、學者抑或領袖？陳慶偉提議是作為政治人物，Beel 則指是作為政治思想家（political thinker）。趙未有直接回答，僅稱「（戴耀廷）諗好多嘢出嚟，係令到我當時嘅工作好困擾」，施德來、陳志全、鄒家成等發笑；吳敏兒及袁嘉蔚則笑得掩嘴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，那趙會認為戴是麻煩製造者（troublemaker）嗎？趙答：「回應法官閣下，有呢個感覺」，被告席傳來笑聲。陳慶偉續指，但趙指戴是「麻煩製造者」，是現時回溯，抑或就當時與戴工作已有此感覺？趙指是當時已有此感覺，又指今時今日回顧，事實上很多戴耀廷倡議推動的事情，「大家有目共睹。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問是指好的抑或壞的事？趙指就他工作而言，「就算啲嘢可能係好，但係喺執行上方面，整個民主派幫手去推動嘅時候呢，其實係好大嘅工作量，好麻煩嘅事情需要處理。」陳仲衡續說，因此戴只是令事情變得困難，而非「麻煩製造者」，趙續指「冇話佢係搞事」，但戴為他工作製造很多困難亦是事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指沒有怪責戴耀廷-惟在法官追問下承認有不滿才稱之為大思想家&quot;&gt;趙指沒有怪責戴耀廷 惟在法官追問下承認有不滿才稱之為「大思想家」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，趙退出初選工作後，是否開始對戴耀廷感到不滿（resentment）？趙同意。Beel 再指，趙事實上是怪責戴耀廷令他有今時今日的困境？趙答「我冇一個怪責嘅情況，因為我今日喺法庭呢度去作證，係為咗協助法庭去更加理解案情去處理案件」，其角色就是盡量就他所知的情況為法庭提供協助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，那趙會認為若沒有戴耀廷2020年的計劃，他就不會落得今天的境況嗎？趙答：「回應法官閣下，呢個都係一個發生咗嘅事實嚟，所以我都要就住我當時係有錯誤嘅判斷，而冇做好一啲盡職審查、謹慎責任等等呢，我要承擔呢個責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指他問的是趙的感受，問他每當想起這件事時，會否一直出現是戴耀廷導致他有今天遭遇的念頭？趙答：「回應法官閣下，當然我係一個人啦，係有情緒嘅」，舉例早前被問五大訴求內容時，他談及「撤回暴動定性」是「停頓咗一段係令人疑問嘅時間」，「因為一諗起衝突嘅場面，我喺個腦海即刻閃過我喺2019年11月3日太古城衝突，因為調停糾紛、保護市民受襲而被咬去左耳嘅片段，而我當時其實嗰吓係，我呆咗就係因為諗返起個畫面。」延伸庭的黃之鋒和吳敏兒發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，因此當他回想起整個初選和之後出問題等，「對於戴耀廷嘅感覺係有嘅」，並指由2012年開始認識戴並知道其工作模式，「叫做一隻手掌拍唔響」，而在整個香港民主運動政制發展的流程，加上2019年反修例運動後整個氣氛，在很多不同因素下，2020年「大家係好雄心壯志同好憤慨嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 打斷趙，指已拉得太遠，着他直接回答問題，趙指「我其實就係去到呢句就開始答啦」，多人發笑。李運騰指，簡而言之，趙是否對戴耀廷有不滿？趙點頭，李再指，因此趙才會稱呼戴是「大思想家、大學者」？趙再點頭答「係有嘅」。黃之鋒及吳敏兒不禁發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指對區諾軒絕對沒有像對戴耀廷的不滿&quot;&gt;趙指對區諾軒「絕對沒有」像對戴耀廷的不滿&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問及區諾軒，趙同意於2020年前已認識區諾軒。被問他們是否朋友，趙指與區工作上有良好的溝通交流，但沒特別私交。Beel 問，即使二人在2020年計劃合作，也沒有變成朋友？趙指「呢個要睇吓辯方律師定性朋友個定義係去到邊個程度」。Beel 舉例，像是一起飲酒和談足球？趟笑指「我記得就係未試過」。Beel 問，那趙對區諾軒有沒有對戴耀廷一樣的不滿？趙答：「絕對沒有。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（19日）踏入審訊第46天。趙家賢續接受代表何桂藍的大狀盤問，他曾多次強調民主動力於2020年5月中下旬才答應承辦初選，惟辯方質疑趙實早於2月已答應，因此才會出席各區協調會議，趙反問：「辯方大狀係咪想喺我個腦度植入一啲唔屬於我嘅認知？」，後稱「絕對不同意」；又重申雖與戴耀廷有意見分歧，但礙於當時社會氣氛而答應承辦初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉又問及「本土派」和「抗爭派」的分別，一度問前者是否認為政策應由本地人、而非由「北方的某些人」決定，趙同意，並指後者於初選後始出現，同意他們反政府並「擺明係隊到行」。此外，辯方亦提及威脅否決預算案是唯一可與政府談判的方法，惟趙不同意，強調立會過半是很重要的民意授權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴耀廷諗好多計劃so-called推動民主&quot;&gt;趙稱戴耀廷「諗好多計劃，so-called推動民主」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢續接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問。Beel 引趙家賢早前提及，戴耀廷於2020年開始成為「較進步（progressive）」民主派人士的領袖，問他指「較進步」是甚麼意思。趙表示，比起當時政局及傳統民主派推動的工作，戴會「諗好多一啲計劃、一啲諗法，去 so-called（所謂）推動民主」，同意法官陳仲衡指例如佔領中環。Beel 再追問趙所指的「較進步」民主派是哪類人士？趙思考一會，指是在公民社會內對戴思維看法較支持或認同的人，指尤其佔中後催生了很多「傘後組織」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱2019年區選當選人較激進令區會未能暢順運作戴耀廷有相當大程度影響&quot;&gt;趙稱2019年區選當選人較激進令區會未能暢順運作、戴耀廷有「相當大程度影響」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，戴在2018至2019年已望對抗政府，但趙不同意其主張；而2019年的區議會選舉中，民主動力與戴耀廷在揀選候選人方面有衝突。趙又確認，2019年區選的新當選議員較激進，反對社區撥款和令議會變得口號式，並指部分本土抗爭派及政治素人的激進不理性行為，令很多區議會事情未能暢順運作。惟趙強調，他亦認識不少「溫和本土派」，及「好實幹嘅政治素人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問到，區議會之所以有新趨勢，是否源於戴耀廷所給予的資源或影響？趙先表示想作更正，指戴的風雲計劃應於2017年（趙主問稱2018年）開始，即使他找到的「風雲戰士」人數不是太多，但戴自2017年已就2019年的區議會選舉「有好多佢一啲諗法同倡議」，並令事情「有機發展落去」。Beel 打斷，再問區議會的新趨勢是否受到戴耀廷的影響，趙回應：「佢係有相當大嘅程度影響。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱本土派與抗爭派有別-前者認為政策應由港人決定未去到講港獨&quot;&gt;趙稱本土派與抗爭派有別 前者認為政策應由港人決定、「未去到講港獨」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問趙所指的「較進步」民主派，是否與傳統民主派不同，主控周天行質疑他問哪範疇；法官李運騰則改問傳統民主派與本土派是否這麼容易被識別，因趙早前提及民主派當中都有不同光譜。趙同意，重申「本土派都有溫和風格嘅人、政治素人都有好多務實做嘢嘅人」，亦指要說清楚，他提及的是「本土派」，非「本土抗爭派」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在陳慶偉要求下，趙解釋兩者的分別，指本土派主張「香港好多政策，係應該着重於喺香港特別行政區境內嘅事情」。陳慶偉問，是否指政策應該由本地人決定，而非由「身處北方的某些人（somebody else in the north）」決定？趙同意，亦補充本土派很着重本土文化及價值觀，及提倡文化保育。陳仲衡問，即是該些政策和價值觀是為了香港、亦由香港人制定的？趙同意。陳慶偉續問，本土派的主張亦包括香港獨立嗎？趙稱一般本土派「就未會去到有呢個講港獨嘅倡議或者思維」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指抗爭派擺明係隊到行認為傳統民主派無進寸&quot;&gt;趙指抗爭派「擺明係隊到行」、認為傳統民主派無進寸&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到「抗爭派」的倡議，趙指是於初選開始後才比較上提出和建立此派系。陳問他們倡議甚麼，是否反政府或對抗政府？趙稱就對現有體制及對政府的壓力方面，「大致上都係咁嘅意思」，因為他們覺得「現有嘅政府、政權，並唔係做緊一啲措施係照顧或者重視香港人」，同時亦覺得傳統民主派在香港三十多年，都沒有甚麼民主的進寸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問到，那「本土抗爭派」的意思是否即將「本土派」與「抗爭派」兩者的政治理念結合，即分別是倡議本土政策及反政府？趙同意。被問及是否可同時屬兩派，趙表示「個光譜係好闊嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 並指趙稱民主派分為傳統民主派、進步派、本土派、抗爭派，那「進步派」的主張又是甚麼？趙解釋：「其實好簡單，佢哋喺個光譜嘅位置就係比起傳統民主派冇咁溫和保守，但係佢哋又唔會好似抗爭派咁樣，擺明係隊到行」。被問區諾軒是屬於哪一陣營，趙指他是傳統民主派出身，亦曾為民主黨成員，但其政治思維比傳統民主派相對進步。法官李運騰最後提醒，裁決並非根據被告所屬的陣營、而是根據他們的言行決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問與戴耀廷意見分歧為何仍答應辦初選-趙指礙於社會氣氛&quot;&gt;辯方問與戴耀廷意見分歧為何仍答應辦初選 趙指礙於社會氣氛&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就趙家賢與民主動力承辦初選發問。趙表示，戴於2019年12月撰文談立會過半，並慢慢開始提倡運用憲制權力和「35+」的想法，惟因他當時耳朵受襲需休養，故沒有與戴辯論如何醞釀立會過半，指戴之後「加插咗好多嘢落去」，同意並不認同其文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，既然趙與戴耀廷有意見分歧，又認為2019年區選後由較激進者當選，加上2020年頭民主動力正進行選民登記活動，為何當時仍答應戴承辦初選？趙一度指已曾回答法官問及的相關問題，其後再解釋「礙於當時整個社會嘅氣氛係要求有初選」，即市民望選民主派入議會反映民意、「唔好再自己打自己浪費選票」，加上各大政黨亦支持參與初選，故即使他知道「同戴耀廷嘅工作嘅情況係唔理想」，他在諮詢民動副召集人後，「就因為作為民主陣營嘅一分子，希望可以付出到」，故答應承辦初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，所謂社會要求有初選是指市民抑或民主派領袖？趙指廣義而言市民希望民主陣營「唔好鬼打鬼」，而進行協調後，參與者同意以初選解決爭議和集中票源。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指民動出席協調會因已是組織者-趙反問係咪想喺我個腦植入唔屬於我嘅認知&quot;&gt;辯方指民動出席協調會因已是組織者 趙反問：係咪想喺我個腦植入唔屬於我嘅認知？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問民主動力在初選的角色是否提供建議，趙同意當時獲邀列席會議是因民動有辦補選初選的經驗，可就此作分享助大家了解。趙又同意，民動總幹事黎敬輝在場抄寫筆記，而趙本人沒有出席部分會議，有出席的也遲到、早走、或以電腦處理區議會事務，而會上大致上是由戴耀廷發言。Beel 問，看起來其實不需要民主動力在場？趙靜默約5秒後抬頭：「想問辯方律師想我點答？」林卓廷和鄒家成均說「吓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，趙其實是受邀出席，而非主動提出想參與，趙同意，並同意黎敬輝或其他兼職同事會代表民動出席會議。Beel 問，既然他們在場，趙家賢為何需到場？趙指因民主動力獲得邀請，而在一些協調會議開始時，「以隆重其事，作為組織嘅召集人，點樣都要到一到。」Beel 問，民動是想變成有用的角色？趙重申民動是獲邀出席，而作為民主陣營中「咁多人參與嘅事情」，民動獲邀就當然希望「喺件事當中、個會議當中，係有參與」，盡量看看有什麼就初選的意見可提供或幫手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，民動當時出席會議，是因為當時已經是初選組織者？趙指之前已提及，民動是5月中下旬才確認承辦初選。惟 Beel 指，趙所說的全屬虛構、並非事實，事實上他在2月已經答應辦初選，因此才會出席協調會議。趙望着 Beel 反問：「辯方大狀係咪想喺我個腦度植入一啲唔屬於我嘅認知？」庭上傳來笑聲，林卓廷、吳政亨等紛紛說「嘩」。陳慶偉指趙可直接說不同意，趙再答：「絕對不同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指支持五大訴求-惟反對以否決財案迫政府回應&quot;&gt;趙指支持五大訴求 惟反對以否決財案迫政府回應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 亦問及趙家賢的立場，問他是否支持五大訴求？趙未有正面回答，指「當時係整個民主陣營嘅光譜都會係知道民間有呢個五大訴求」。Beel 指是問趙的立場，他續答「支持」。法官陳仲衡續指，即使支持五大訴求，就如何爭取也有不同意見、有很廣闊的光譜，趙同意指「絕對係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，他是否支持透過否決預算案迫使政府回應五大訴求？趙指「我反對嘅」，至於以否決財案迫政府落實普選，趙也反對。被問是否支持就警暴成立調查委員會，趙指他支持由大法官成立調查委員會，就反修例運動起源和後續衝突作獨立調查；至於是否支持特赦抗爭者，趙指會稱之為「撤銷檢控」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指威脅否決財案為唯一談判方法-趙不同意-堅稱立會過半可獲民意授權&quot;&gt;辯方指威脅否決財案為唯一談判方法 趙不同意 堅稱立會過半可獲「民意授權」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙曾供稱，如立會過半可推動利民政策，他在盤問下解釋是指提出私人草案以及要求政府回應的動議。Beel 續指，但即使有立會過半，仍會因分組點票而令可通過的政策非常少。趙指立法會投票的確如此運作，但廣義上大家會認同議席若過半，民意授權的能力便會大增，與政府討論時亦更有力量爭取民主陣營倡議的政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙亦曾提及，立會過半的目標包括讓政府回應五大訴求。Beel 問如何令政府回應？趙重申當有民意授權時，「正常嘅政府係應該要重視而去回應」，惟當時政府好像完全無就五大訴求作回應，亦沒有就當中要求作清楚解說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續問，但事實上即使有「35+」，泛民也會因分組點票而不能通過落實五大訴求的議案？趙再指立會投票制度當然有「局限性」，但重申立會過半是很重要的民意授權，而他雖從未曾任立會議員，但作為民主派一員，亦望其代表入立會後運用他們的權力與政府商討。他又強調，具體如何進行，「我相信立法會議員佢哋獲得民意授權，佢哋有個自主性去處理。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指出，事實上唯一可以與政府談判的方法，就是威脅否決預算案，「沒有其他有效的機制」？趙說：「Disagree.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/R5qhRRk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（19日）踏入審訊第46天。趙家賢繼續接受代表何桂藍的大狀盤問，指戴耀廷曾望民主動力捐眾籌的80至100萬予香港民研，以建立新的投票系統就否決財案向泛民施壓，惟趙終僅建議捐40萬，解釋因不想與戴的計劃有任何牽連，但戴又「不斷咁樣催住我、追問住我」令他「好煩擾」，故「搵一個中間位，叫做可以將件事情推走咗」，又指可令戴「唔使對外講話民主動力食晒啲錢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就民主動力帖文出現「對抗暴政」等字眼，趙指相信撰文的總幹事黎敬輝是迎合當時社會氣氛和民主陣營聲音。辯方追問趙是否支持「對抗暴政」，法官李運騰一度笑言「怎會有人公然說自己支持暴政呢？」，趙終指他不會說「對抗暴政」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱蘋果記者以半個朋友身份關心他-對戴耀廷攬炒一文感好詫異&quot;&gt;趙稱《蘋果》記者以半個朋友身份關心他 對戴耀廷「攬炒」一文感好詫異&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢續接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問。他確認，曾向警方國安處錄取4份口供，分別於2022年9月29日、2023年1月10日及21日，及同年3月21日。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方就趙退出初選的情況發問。趙曾供稱，於2020年7月14日獲《蘋果日報》政治版資深女記者轉發戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步〉一文，並提醒他小心，他才首次閱畢該文章。Beel 問到，此前趙有沒有留意到戴於3至5月撰寫的文章？趙指協調會議上有人曾提出支持戴的文章，戴遂講解。趙續補充，當時該名女記者亦轉發《文匯報》和《大公報》相關報導，着他留意建制派批評。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問到，該記者當時並非訪問他，只是純粹來警告他？趙表示於2004年認識她，「喺工作上同埋叫做有半個朋友身份嘅角色，佢聯絡我係出於朋友嘅關心同擔憂。」趙續指，以該記者「做咗咁耐傳媒專業嚟講，佢係會覺得好有問題」，而她雖很資深，亦因工作量太多，「佢自己都根本冇為意戴耀廷當時有篇咁嘅文章寫咗出嚟，所以佢自己知道嘅時候都好詫異。」說畢有人大聲嘆氣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指趙家賢退出非因戴耀廷文章-趙不同意&quot;&gt;辯方指趙家賢退出非因戴耀廷文章 趙不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，區諾軒並無與他討論該篇文章，而助手黎敬輝、民主動力其他職員、區議會同事和朋友亦無叫他留意該文。Beel 向趙指出，事實上他一直都知道這篇文章，並了解戴耀廷以《基本法》權力否決預算案的看法；而趙決定退出初選，並不是因為《蘋果》記者的提醒和戴耀廷的文章，趙不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據民主動力2020年10月的會議記錄，趙曾於會上稱退出協調是因國務院及港澳辦譴責初選。法官李運騰續問，趙退出是因受官方譴責？趙回應退出的決定「其實係幾日嘅時間」，先是7月13晚記者會後，得悉戴不知道初選有否違大陸法，至翌日《蘋果》記者提醒他文章的重大問題，再加上區諾軒致電稱會退出初選，故趙同意區先退出，他再在「適當時機」退出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指抗爭派記者會事項與協調會議事項大致相同-趙不同意&quot;&gt;辯方指抗爭派記者會事項與協調會議事項大致相同 趙不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意兩辦和國務院的譴責亦是他退出的原因之一，因認為「已經唔係香港嘅事件，係提升到國家層面嘅事情」。他最後補充，本土抗爭派於15日的記者會令他有「好特別嘅思想轉變」，知道民主動力和他一定要盡快與整個初選切割。Beel 指，抗爭派記者會上提出的事項其實與協調會議上提出的事項大致相同？趙稱「不太同意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴耀廷不斷催促感好煩擾-故建議捐40萬予民研-搵中間位將件事推走&quot;&gt;趙稱戴耀廷不斷催促感「好煩擾」 故建議捐40萬予民研 「搵中間位將件事推走」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續就民主動力對香港民意研究所的捐款發問。根據民動會議紀錄，趙曾建議將眾籌剩餘的40萬捐予香港民研。趙解釋因雙方原本簽約於官方選舉前進行大型民調，因選舉延期才無生效，故認為「有呢個責任叫做係捐一筆錢畀香港民研」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，戴耀廷另曾稱望民動捐80至100萬予民研建立新的民意收集系統，以在民主派於否決預算案有顧慮時收集民意指示。但趙強調「絕對唔想我同民主動力就住戴耀廷所諗嘅計劃有任何牽連」，因覺得就《國安法》有很高風險，惟「我係唔識得向戴耀廷 say no」，因此與執委會決定無條件捐一筆數額不足以開新項目的款項予民研，強調「咁就令到佢（戴耀廷）唔駛對外講話『民主動力食晒啲錢』，又或者成日追住我要啲錢去做一啲佢唔同諗法嘅項目」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，會議是2020年10月的事，即趙到了當時仍按戴耀廷的說話來做？但陳慶偉打斷，先問該40萬捐款是趙還是戴的主意。趙回應：「係我基於戴耀廷不斷咁樣催住我、追問住我底下，我覺得好煩擾、好想迴避嘅狀態下，而我諗嘅一個建議出嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意陳仲衡所指，戴是希望趙捐大筆款項予民研，而他則決定無條件捐較小金額。陳續問，趙會否視自己是跟隨戴的想法？趙指：「我唔會話係跟隨，我會覺得係搵一個中間位，叫做可以將件事情推走咗」，陳續問：「是作為調解員角色？」，但陳慶偉打斷指是時候小休。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢同意因選舉延期-戴耀廷才提出望以民調向泛民就否決財案施壓&quot;&gt;趙家賢同意因選舉延期 戴耀廷才提出望以民調向泛民就否決財案施壓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就趙家賢提及的兩個民調，趙解釋選前民調可得知候選人支持度，並透過數據類比調整選舉策略。他以新東「6+1」的目標為例，如民調顯示民主陣營票數或超過7席，便需透過宣傳分配選票，如叫支持度最高的首兩個團隊支持者投票予第7位團隊；亦可着第7至8位團隊合作，擇其一做主打以確保「穩妥」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，若支持度不足以取得目標議席又如何處理？趙指戴透過以往選民投票數據估算出目標議席，加上當時市民對政府不滿，在「好熱切」氣氛下投票率會提升，故就支持度的估算即使不是100%但都十拿九穩，同意李運騰指當時「好大信心」地區直選拿到「6 6 4 4 3」議席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問及民調顯示市民不支持否決財案情況-惟官稱結果不一定公布&quot;&gt;辯方問及民調顯示市民不支持否決財案情況 惟官稱結果不一定公布&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於有關向泛民施壓否決預算案的民調，李運騰問這是否「35+計劃」的一部分？並指以他理解，是因官方選舉延期，戴耀廷才提出進行此民調，陳仲衡亦同意。趙指兩位法官的理解正確，又重申戴是在8月底至9月頭向他提及望以此民調向民主派施壓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，若最後民調結果顯示，大部分市民不支持否決財政預算案，那當選人是否要遵守承諾？惟陳仲衡指，Beel 的說法是假設結果會向民主派公布。Beel 面露驚訝發笑，反問「為什麼他們不會知道？」，陳慶偉說「不一定」，陳仲衡亦指會否使用該民調或視乎結果。李運騰則指，若相關事項從沒被討論，就此發問並無意義，Beel 續就其他議題發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指黎敬輝草擬文件時想迎合傳統民主派及本土派&quot;&gt;趙指黎敬輝草擬文件時想迎合傳統民主派及本土派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官早前曾質疑民主動力文件字眼，趙家賢稱由民動總幹事黎敬輝準備，向法官認錯。Beel 今就此發問，指趙曾形容黎敬輝很有責任心、對細節細心，那黎是否不會將個人意見放在民動的官方文件如工作報告，因那是不負責任的表現？趙指，不會說黎「帶自己嘅情緒擺入去」，而是「就住整個社會氣氛」，並指民主動力作為一個協調組織和交流平台，「我有時留意到佢幫手起草嘅文件、一啲用詞呢，係想迎合到傳統民主派，同埋係比較上進步甚至乎係本土派。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續提及，就民主動力2020年6月宣傳眾籌的帖文有「光復議會」、「對抗暴政」字眼，趙曾稱絕非民主動力政治立場；惟 Beel 指，黎敬輝作為職員一定會知道民動的政治立場。不過法官李運騰先問，民主動力事實上有沒有政治立場？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指民主動力角色僅行政支援-政治上無好清楚立場&quot;&gt;趙指民主動力角色僅行政支援 政治上無好清楚立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指，他正想帶出民動並非一個政黨組織，而且自2002年成立以來的實務工作，就是協調傳統民主派內部糾紛或協作大型活動。他指從創會召集人得知，民主派立法會議員有「飯盒會」前，實由民主動力作為他們的「聯合統籌秘書處」；直至成立了「飯盒會」，民動的功能才交由議員處理。趙續指，民主動力在傳統民主派中擔任行政及支援角色，故政治上不會有「好特別出眾」或「好清楚」的立場，亦是迎合民主派需要而提供協助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在法官提問下重申，若由他發布帖文，會選擇刪去「光復議會」和「對抗暴政」，重申相信職員草擬時「有迎合到當時嘅社會氣氛」，因「民主陣營都有啲咁嘅聲音而加落去」。Beel 兩度問趙是否支持「對抗暴政」，趙指已回答若有檢視帖文，不會用該字眼，後又稱「我頭先已經回答咗個問題」。法官陳仲衡指，辯方並非問他會否在帖文用該句子，而是他是否支持該句話的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再次問趙是否支持「對抗暴政」，並在法官李運騰提醒下補充是指就香港的語境而言。李續笑言，若不補充該語境，問題是無意義的，「怎會有人公然說自己支持暴政呢？（“How can anyone say I openly support tyranny?”）」Beel 再問，趙是否會說這句句子，趙終答「不會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑趙將兩次新東會議混淆-趙不同意&quot;&gt;辯方質疑趙將兩次新東會議混淆 趙不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，就新東協調會議，趙曾供稱在4月14日的首次會議，鄒家成等曾就運用否決權字眼作爭論。Beel 指出，事實上與會者沒有就否決預算案作討論，包括使用「會運用」或「會積極運用」的字眼，趙不同意，並指曾經有討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，黎敬輝的會議筆記沒有提過與會者討論否決預算案，只提及戴耀廷有在會上提出。趙解釋，筆記記下戴的討論重點，而因當時鄒家成及民主黨代表莊榮輝就否決預算案用字有「好熾熱」的討論，他亦親眼目睹，因此着黎「唔使記錄啦，我都聽咗啦」，指「我都唔想佢要做得咁多嘅工作」。Beel 笑說「Really」，續向趙指，事實上他是將4月14日的首次會議，與他原先以為自己有出席的5月5日第二次會議混淆，趙不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎敬輝筆記時，趙亦指筆記顯示「慢必 蘇浩」是指陳志全和蘇浩均有出席當日會議，與區諾軒在盤問稱陳志全沒有出席兩次會議有出入。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙曾與戴討論否決財案獲回應大家去傾故無特別參與-不同意會上只達4共識&quot;&gt;趙曾與戴討論否決財案獲回應「大家去傾」故無特別參與 不同意會上只達4共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到既然趙家賢不同意否決預算案，他有否與區諾軒就此事與戴討論？趙思索約15秒後，指只記得曾向戴表達有關無差別否決、或着重運用權力否決預算案的事，當時戴回應指：「你睇吓喺個會度大家有唔同意見，咪大家去傾囉。」趙認為「咁我就變咗係等與會者自己去傾，我同民主動力嘅角色喺呢方面都唔特別參與啦」。趙同意陳慶偉所指，有將這件事向戴提及，而最後因與民動無關，故由戴自行向與會者周旋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，新東會上唯一達成的共識是否只是舉辦初選、替補機制、出選名單及辦選舉論壇4點，趙原答「冇錯」，但陳仲衡指辯方是問「只是」有上述4項共識，趙改稱「並不是」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（18日）踏入審訊第45天。趙家賢繼續接受代表黃碧雲及林卓廷的大狀盤問，就「墨落無悔」提及協調會議的共同綱領「已達致抗爭陣營光譜的最大公因數」，趙認為會上有意見拉扯，聲明卻似乎將所有與會者寫成「一個抗爭陣營」，向他人施壓。辯方亦指，聲明可見發起人亦意識到就否決預算案有「立場差異」，否則毋須向他人施壓，惟法官陳慶偉認為聲明提及「已取得共識的共同綱領」，顯示最終仍達成了共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙又指，與會者「都好畀面戴耀廷」，戴就細微爭議提建議他們亦無異議；而黃碧雲及林卓廷就無差別否決預算案「無特別表態」，趙有出席的新東及九西首次會議均無就否決財案達共識，即使早前稱新東第二次會議投票通過「會運用」否決權，亦是非正式投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指會上就否決財案有意見拉扯-墨落無悔發起人望施壓如不簽聲明就非同陣營&quot;&gt;趙指會上就否決財案有意見拉扯 「墨落無悔」發起人望施壓：如不簽聲明就非同陣營&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢繼續接受代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文盤問。辯方今展示鄒家成 Facebook 發布的「墨落無悔」聲明書，表示就當中認同「五大訴求，缺一不可」、及若支持度不足須表明停止選舉工程的條款，均沒有爭議；唯一有爭議的只是運用否決權，趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;聲明提及「我們認為，在初選協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領，乃一眾參選人之合作基礎。考慮到立場差異，此一綱領已達致抗爭陣營光譜的最大公因數」。沈引「考慮到立場差異，此一綱領已達致抗爭陣營光譜的最大公因數」，問根據協調會議，相關「立場差異」是否指否決預算案的爭議？趙未有直接回答，指鄒是提及「抗爭陣營」而非「整個民主陣營」，並在法官澄清下，同意傳統民主派和抗爭派唯一的爭議，是有關否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，事實上趙家賢並不會知道聲明中「抗爭陣營」一詞的實際所指，趙表示據他對聲明的理解，會上是有一些協議和基礎，但當中有立場差異；而聲明書的發起人認為他們的陣營就是「最大公因數」，聲明語境「就好似想將所有參與協調會議嘅都係一個抗爭陣營，而事實上喺當時大家仲有一啲不同意見嘅拉扯喺當中」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，即趙認為「抗爭陣營」是一個籠統的用法（general term）？趙指「法官閣下我唔可以咁 absolute 咁答」，並解釋其理解是發起人「想畀啲壓力啲人，如果你唔簽個聲明書呢，就唔係我哋同一個陣營嘅人啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指就否決預算案有立場差異-官強調已達成共識&quot;&gt;辯方指就否決預算案有「立場差異」 官強調已達成共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續指，不論「抗爭陣營」一詞所指為何，但根據聲明書，就是他們就否決預算案有「立場差異」，而聲明發起者當時亦察覺到有此差異。惟法官陳慶偉不同意，指根據聲明中「我們認為⋯已取得共識的共同綱領」，不論「抗爭陣營」所指為何，「他們就運用否決權都似乎達成了共識」、發起人並不認為有「差異」，又着辯方應考慮前文後理，而非只抽取其中一句。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟沈指，無從得知已取得的「共識」是指什麼。陳慶偉指就是關於運用否決權。沈指句子沒有如此提及，陳再指「隨便你，你可以在陳詞說明，但你現在有困難」。沈指他一直都有困難，反指若已經取得共識，就無需寫聲明、也無需向他人施壓；惟陳再重申，不同陣營可能有不同意見，但最終還是達成了共識。沈終指會留待陳詞，沒有繼續發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，不是要說服沈士文，只是講出他個人的理解，沈重申他完全不同意，但會留待陳詞。李運騰亦指雖然法庭暫時看法不同，但仍願接受辯方說服（open to persuasion），又指重點其實是黃碧雲和林卓廷都沒有簽署「墨落無悔」。趙續在盤問下確認，二人均沒有簽署和認同「墨落無悔」，並同意二人提名表格均沒有提及否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 黃碧雲&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙認九西首次會議未就否決財案達共識惟協議初稿有相關條款無字眼顯示曾被討論&quot;&gt;趙認九西首次會議未就否決財案達共識惟協議初稿有相關條款、無字眼顯示曾被討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續指，趙家賢曾提及戴耀廷有「亂咁嚟」的傾向，包括在「雷動計劃」未授權就賣廣告，及在民主動力未答應時已向與會者稱已邀請民動。沈續舉出其他戴「亂咁嚟」的例子，指趙曾供稱在九西首次會議，甚少談及否決預算案議題，亦因此沒有就此達成共識，但在會後不久，戴卻發出了「35+立會過半計劃 民主派九西協調機制（初稿）」，提及參與協調者認同「會積極運用立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續展示文件，表示雖然是以「初稿」為題，但並沒有字眼顯示就否決預算案的段落曾被討論。主控萬德豪一度要求趙家賢避席，認為辯方提問方式不公，似乎暗示戴發出文件時沒提及目的，但事實上主問時已提及戴發出該文件時表明：「這是我草擬的文件，作下次會議討論的基礎。」惟法官李運騰認為看不到不公，指控方可以覆問，陳慶偉亦指辯方問題僅是指該份初稿從表面看來，似乎從來沒有被討論或將會被討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢其後返回法庭，沈士文再問，雖然文件以「初稿」為題，但就否決預算案的段落，是否沒有字眼顯示該部分曾被討論、或是要被參與者同意。趙同意，指整份文件的內容始終是草稿，沒有任何附註標明當中內容「係從邊度討論或收返嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指新東未就7張名單參選達共識-惟協議稱首7張名單參選&quot;&gt;辯方指新東未就7張名單參選達共識 惟協議稱首7張名單參選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續以新界東為例，展示民主動力總幹事黎敬輝就5月5日第二次新東會議的筆記，談及出選名單的情況：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Benny（戴耀廷）：如被DQ，靈童轉生；N+1，共7隊 可以有彈性，可以再傾&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;鄒家成：會否考慮初選後按形勢調整 N 定 N+1 或其他範圍外的隊伍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Benny：當初6+1，因為可能有7席，第7位的作用，可以於2/9民調後再傾&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;? : 初選後，再決定第7命運，如為攞到第7席，先再討論及宣傳&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在盤問下表示，戴耀廷大方向是望保守獲6席，並望可多取一度獲7席，而據黎敬輝筆記，第7席的事宜會留待之後再討論和決定。惟沈續展示新界東的「final」文件「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新界東協調機制協議」，提及是「由首七張名單參與官方選舉，其他名單承諾不參與官方的選舉」，問是否絕不是新界東達成的共識？趙指根據助手筆記「就睇唔到一個好大嘅分別」。沈續指，惟根據筆記，其實並沒有就7張名單參選和其他名單不參選達成共識，趙答：「根據助手筆記就冇提及過呢樣嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑衞生服務界無開會但戴耀廷照撰協議-趙引述戴稱曾與所有參選人個別商討&quot;&gt;辯方質疑衞生服務界無開會但戴耀廷照撰協議 趙引述戴稱曾與所有參選人個別商討&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續以衞生服務界為例，指該界別沒有舉辦過任何協調會議，但戴卻草擬出一份協議。沈續展示戴6月8日於組織者群組發出的「35+計劃 民主派衞生服務界協調機制協議」文件，列明參與協調者認同「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈問到，趙是否不知道戴在沒有召開會議下，如何撰寫出這份協議？趙指不清楚，但提及由於衞生服務界沒有開協調會議，他曾問戴如何與相關參選人討論，戴告知他有與所有參選人個別聯絡溝通、仔細商討，趙形容猶如做「穿梭式調解（shuttle mediation）」，即不見面但通過調解員與持份者商討，在延伸庭的被告包括吳敏兒聞後發笑。趙續指他不太清楚商討內容，得知戴有與他們溝通後亦沒有再仔細追問。沈問到，但趙並不知道戴實質有沒有做到？趙思考數秒後回答：「我當時真誠地確信佢有做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指衞生服務界勢力板塊轉變較進取派佔上風-倡辦初選推舉立法會代表&quot;&gt;趙指衞生服務界勢力板塊轉變、較進取派「佔上風」 倡辦初選推舉立法會代表&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在法官詢問下，確認以其認知，衞生服務界從沒開過協調會議。李運騰續問，既然衞生服務界沒有舉辦任何協調會議或初選論壇，舉辦初選有什麼意義？趙回應指會「盡我所知協助法庭」，並指衞生服務界多年來均由民主派贏取議席，當時連任幾屆的議員為香港護士協會主席李國麟教授，「而本身香港護士協會係比較上支持民主，係好溫和務實嘅護士工會。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，過往在選委會選舉中，護士協會與護士業界獲一定比數議席，「叫做係業界係均衡嘅參與」；但2017年選委會選舉，一些較為「行得前少少、支持民主光譜嘅醫護界人士」贏取全部30席。趙續指，他們認為李國麟政見「太過溫和保守」，再加上2019年反修例運動後有新的醫管局工會成立，很多成員是衞生服務界選民，因此「當時喺功能組別裡面嘅勢力板塊，就開始有啲轉變」。李運騰指，即較進取（progressive）一派「佔上風」？趙同意，並指他們希望成為立法會代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李追問那為何要舉辦初選，趙表示以其認知，因他們希望從支持民主觀念的候選人中「可以團結一致推一個候選人出嚟」。李問是誰的主意？趙稱「新興嘅衞生服務界團體好 vocal、好倡議應該要有呢個初選」，而「最重要就係當時現任議員李國麟教授都願意參與」。趙確認，李國麟終有參與初選，陳慶偉指記得他是「墊底」，趙同意，重申「業界裡面勢力板塊轉變」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙認無清晰制定如何達共識-稱不同民主派好畀面戴耀廷-戴提建議無異議&quot;&gt;趙認無清晰制定如何達共識 稱不同民主派「好畀面戴耀廷」 戴提建議無異議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續向趙家賢指出辯方案情，並着他可答「同意」、「不同意」和「不知道」。沈先指，根據協調會議和文件，參與者被告知初選的初心是避免撞票和爭取最多議席，趙同意。沈續指，事實上就共識如何達成並沒有任何規則，惟趙家賢思考約20秒後指約只限於三個選項，「有啲唔係好答到。」辯方着他可隨意解釋，趙續指在整個過程，「我留意唔到係有一個正式嘅文件、或者係好清晰點樣制定到如何達致一個共識嘅做法」，而他觀察到不同光譜的民主陣營人士，在會議中「都好畀面戴耀廷、都對區諾軒好信任」，而在一些細微的爭議位，「戴耀廷可能用咗一啲做法、建議『咁樣做啦』，即場大家冇咩異議。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在法官詢問下，確認並非所有出席會議的人士均有參與初選，亦非所有參與初選的人有出席會議。他並指戴耀廷起初是從傳媒、網絡又或親身得知有人有興趣參選，並會邀請他們出席會議，而會議人數沒有限制，首次新東會議便有約三四十人，包括候選人和義工等。林卓廷一度驚訝問「三、四十人？」，鄒家成向他點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意新東第二次會議為非正式投票新東及九西首次協調會無就否決財案達共識&quot;&gt;趙同意新東第二次會議為非正式投票、新東及九西首次協調會無就否決財案達共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙早前據助手筆記稱，新東第二次會議投票通過「會運用」否決權。沈士文續指出，當時所謂的「投票」，實際上並非正式投票，只是讓與會者表達意見？趙同意，並指「如果係一個正式嘅投票，就會講明係正式投票」，若使用其他字眼「咁一定唔係正式投票」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈亦指出，新東及九西的協調會議，並沒有就否決預算案達成共識。主控周天行問是會議哪個階段，沈指是兩區最後一次協調會議之後，陳慶偉並補充是以趙個人所知，非由助手黎敬輝告知。趙思索約10秒後稱：「我個人嚟講係唔太確認有冇共識。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指趙的回答有點勉強（reluctant），並追問原因，趙表示因自己沒有參與會議。陳指他可回答就他有出席的會議而言，即新東及九西首次會議是否沒有就否決財案達成共識？趙同意，指「因為佢哋係討論緊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問黃碧雲及林卓廷有否同意或答應否決財案-趙無特別表態&quot;&gt;被問黃碧雲及林卓廷有否同意或答應否決財案 趙：無特別表態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈最後指出，在整個35+計劃及初選中，黃碧雲及林卓廷從沒有同意或答應無差別否決預算案，趙思考約10秒後遭陳慶偉追問：「你是否知道？抑或你未能回答？」趙問：「沈大狀你可唔可以再問多次？」沈再重複問題，趙思考一輪後終稱：「喺我個人認知嚟講，佢哋冇特別就呢方面表態」，並指自己作為民主黨員，收到黨的訊息都沒有特別說明要否決預算案，只稱望參與初選減低票源衝撞，「所以我認知係佢哋無特別喺呢方面提及任何事情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙於錄影會面稱何桂藍岑敖暉等vocal啲向溫和民主派施壓&quot;&gt;趙於錄影會面稱：何桂藍岑敖暉等「vocal啲」、向溫和民主派施壓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;較早前沈向趙確認2021年6月29日首次警誡會面錄影的謄本內容，當中涉及趙在整個初選的心路歷程，長12頁，趙庭上以約6分鐘讀畢。被問是否確認會面內容，趙指就傳統民主派對否決財案「都好反對」，望改為「好有保留、好有顧慮」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續指謄本中趙的發言有一個位置寫着「聽不清」，該句為：「鄒家成啦，王百羽啦，張可森啦，呢個叫做何桂藍啦，同埋呢仲有呢個嘅岑敖暉嘅，咁佢哋呢幾個就比較上，我哋叫做⋯（聽不清）喺一個嘅協調會議當中呢，係會同好多溫和民主派去辯論呀，即係去施壓，就係希望即係透過係用民意個道德高地⋯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳提議播放有關片段作澄清，辯方亦問趙是否記得自己說過甚麼，趙指「我嘗試回想」，但不久後稱：「我回想返都唔係好記得我嗰句係講咩。」沈其後播放片段，趙確認他稱：「咁佢哋呢幾個就比較上，我哋叫做 vocal 啲」。沈士文表示完成盤問，下午將由代表施德來的大狀黃廷光盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（18日）踏入審訊第45天。趙家賢接受參選九龍東的施德來的大狀盤問，同意民協「好溫和務實」，而前民協主席施德來性格「好懂得尊重人」，即使民協作為傳統民主派「畀人好針對」亦會很有禮貌回應，「我未見過佢同其他人有嗰種黃毓民式嘅對鬧指罵。」而九東所有參選人報名時均夾附共同綱領，提及「會積極運用」否決權，趙確認戴曾指該份文件是基於他草擬的協議。辯方並指，施德來報名時原沒有夾附共同綱領，惟一兩日後獲民主動力職員來電要求提交，趙表示不知情，亦沒有指示職員作出此要求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱民協好溫和務實&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱民協「好溫和務實」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大狀沈士文早上完成盤問趙家賢，下午由代表施德來的大狀黃廷光繼續。趙在辯方盤問下確認，於2004年加入民主黨，至2020年已曾為從政者（politicians）16年。法官陳仲衡一度問他入黨的年紀，趙指是19歲，陳問他當時已叫自己為從政者？趙指該年紀當然不會，而自己是自2003年七一遊行後開始參與民主運動和社會服務工作，並於2005年在民主黨李柱銘和楊森的辦事處以社區顧問身份在太古城做地區工作，才開始視自己為從政者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在盤問下，確認知道香港民主民生協進會（民協）這個政治團體。被問民協是否較溫和的政黨，趙指不論他在修讀社會科學時、還是其後參與香港政治圈子後的認知，民協在基層民生以及民主推動的工作上「都係好溫和務實」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱施德來好懂得尊重人未見過佢有黃毓民式嘅對鬧指罵&quot;&gt;趙稱施德來「好懂得尊重人」：未見過佢有黃毓民式嘅對鬧指罵&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，於2016年底施德來任民協主席時認識他，並於2017年開始與施在協調選舉上有接觸，指施有代表民協出席民主動力召開的民主派地區協調會議，包括2019年區選協調會議，同意該些會議大約每3個月舉行一次。此時趙突然問黃廷光「唔好意思，大狀點稱呼㗎？」，黃答他姓「黃」，趙回答時續以「黃大狀」稱呼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續同意，2018年立法會就九西及新東舉行補選，而民主派為此舉行初選，民主動力於2017年底緊密召開十多次會議；其中民協前主席馮檢基曾參與該次初選，因此他與施在工作上有緊密接觸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意自己非常熟悉施德來的性格，並補充「雖然我同佢唔係私交上好特別老友，但係喺工作上面，我哋係經常交流意見、商討，所以對佢嘅性格認知都充分嘅」。趙形容，施德來「係一個好懂得尊重人嘅性格」，而就他在表達意見的所有態度及用詞，「我唔會用圓滑啦」，但會形容他「好識得尊重人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，縱使施在各方面討論有不同意見，「佢都會係一步步、有理有節代表民協去表達佢嘅立場」；又指即使民協作為傳統民主派「畀人好針對」，「佢都係會好有禮貌地作回應，我未見過佢會同其他人有嗰種黃毓民式嘅對鬧指罵。」法官陳仲衡指，但都要有黃毓民的快速應對（quick respond）？趙思考後笑言：「唔好意思，唔識答。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到施的政治立場，趙形容是「溫和理性」，亦同意是配合民協溫和務實的取態。趙亦同意，曾與施德來一同出席2018年東京的亞洲議員論壇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱九東自發交共同綱領-曾告知同事要收取惟強調非大會要求&quot;&gt;趙稱九東自發交共同綱領 曾告知同事要收取惟強調非大會要求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續就初選提名表格發問，其中九東參選人在提交提名表格時均附上共同綱領，提及「會積極運用」否決權，趙同意共同綱領由該選區的素人發起，參選人自發呈交；而他作為民主動力代表，戴曾告知「要收埋佢哋提交嘅呢啲附件」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問趙有否將之告訴民主動力職員，趙表示有與同事講明除參與初選所需的官方表格外，其他文件「並唔係大會要求嘅」，「不過我哋照收起嚟存檔」，但沒有將共同綱領張貼在票站。趙亦沒有特別叫職員留意收集到的共同綱領。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意九東共同綱領據戴耀廷協議擬訂-但不知誰準備和從何獲得&quot;&gt;趙同意九東共同綱領據戴耀廷協議擬訂 但不知誰準備和從何獲得&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，民主動力只曾將提名表格、而非共同綱領張貼在 Facebook 讓參選人下載。黃問九東參選人如何可以取得該份共同綱領？趙指以其認知他們是根據戴耀廷撰寫的協議內容，應用在共同綱領上。李運騰指是問參選人可從哪裏獲得共同綱領，趙指「呢個我真係唔清楚」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，戴耀廷是否曾發出九東協調文件，參選人並將其加加減減、修訂成共同綱領並作為附件提交？趙同意戴曾告訴他共同綱領內容是基於戴草擬的文件，但同意事實上不知道參選人在哪裏取得共同綱領。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，九東的6名參選人包括譚文豪、譚得志、施德來、胡志偉、李嘉達及黃之鋒，是否都有夾附內容相同的共同綱領，趙同意。李指那必定有人為他們準備共同綱領，趙表示「就咁睇嘅情況係」，但重申不知道由誰準備，亦不知參選人從哪裏獲得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指施德來交表後被民動職員要求夾附共同綱領-趙稱不知道亦無要求&quot;&gt;辯方指施德來交表後被民動職員要求夾附共同綱領 趙稱不知道亦無要求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問是否有九東參選人沒有附交共同綱領，趙稱職員匯報時沒有特別提及。黃續問施德來首次交表時是否沒有夾附共同綱領？惟陳慶偉指趙已稱不知道，並改為問施是否不只提交表格一次。趙回應指很多人報名，而職員稱部分人有文件要後補，但無特別提及施，同意他不清楚施是在交表時一併附上共同綱領，還是後來補交。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃廷光續展示譚得志提名表格，當中共同綱領顯示於於6月22日簽署。黃問表面看來，譚最初是否沒有將共同綱領與提名表格一同呈交？趙指表格顯示職員於6月20日收取，可見譚是交了提名表格後才補交。辯方續展示施德來表格，顯示於6月20日下午收取，並指出施最初交表時沒有夾附共同綱領，是在交表後一兩日，收到民主動力職員的來電，告知他沒有在表格夾附共同綱領，要求他呈交已簽署的共同綱領，趙指他不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，趙曾否指示職員，九東參選人提交提名表格時須夾附共同綱領？黃廷光亦問有否指示職員要求九東參選人附交共同綱領？趙指「我並無作出呢個指示」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續指，施德來當時在民動職員要求下，在一個螢幕截圖上簽署，並透過 WhatsApp 呈交，趙指「抱歉黃大狀，我唔知」。黃續展示施德來和譚得志簽署的共同綱領，問施的簽名是否較大？惟法官陳慶偉不批准發問，李運騰並指重點是施德來簽署前對共同綱領的文件是否認知。黃廷光終表示完成盤問，續由代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 發問，法官押至明日進行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙原定明就民事案件應訊-官通知已押後&quot;&gt;趙原定明就民事案件應訊 官通知已押後&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，法官陳慶偉指留意到趙家賢明日有一宗民事案件，趙表示曾透過律師回覆需延期，但不清楚明日是否要上庭，陳表示會替他檢查。陳在臨散庭前，通知趙他明天在區域法院的聆訊會押後，並指刑事案件比民事案件優先，着趙明天就本案應訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指「法官閣下唔好意思，多謝你幫手跟進了解多啲聽日個情況」，並指了解懲教署如收到提犯令（body order）或會將他先帶去區域法院，指「當然我知道喺高院呢度係 very first priority，要喺依度協助法庭處理案件」，故麻煩法官處理。陳指趙的律師已為趙申請撤銷提犯令，並下令懲教明日將趙帶到庭。案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，趙家賢早前被太古城一名業主入稟，質疑屋苑管理公司多年來以管理基金辦康樂活動，要求高院頒令禁制及要求管理公司索償。&lt;/p&gt;

The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) began increasing its activities as Tsai was in the United States and particularly after her meeting with McCarthy.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;On April 8, the day after Tsai arrived back in Taiwan, the PLA announced and launched large-scale military exercises around Taiwan. These exercises are more significant than China’s responses to past Taiwan presidential transits, and they are reminiscent of the unprecedented PLA response to then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to China’s major show of military force, Beijing has taken relatively less direct diplomatic and economic measures to punish Taiwan and the United States since April 2. China issued four strong statements denouncing the transit and meeting with McCarthy on April 6 and sanctioned a handful of U.S. and Taiwan entities afterwards. On April 10, China signaled desire to deepen economic and other exchanges with Taiwan. What remains to be seen is how former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou’s trip to China will impact domestic politics in Taiwan — a trip that was likely encouraged and at least partially orchestrated by Beijing. For example, Beijing likely welcomed Ma’s remarks to the press on April 7 after he returned to Taiwan – Ma characterized Taipei’s current leadership and policy as one leading Taiwan towards danger and war and warned that Taiwan has a choice between peace and war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting between President Tsai and Speaker McCarthy was framed as an alternative to an immediate visit by Speaker McCarthy to Taiwan — at least postponing his intended travel to the island. By having Tsai and McCarthy meet during an unofficial transit of the United States, there were hopes that Beijing would not escalate as much as it did when Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China used the visit by Speaker Pelosi to provoke the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis, which included unprecedented military exercises around the island. Compared to the previous Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1995–1996, the August 2022 exercises were closer to the main island of Taiwan — with some of the exercise zones extending into Taiwan’s territorial waters. The PLA Rocket Force also fired multiple ballistic missiles over the main island of Taiwan, with some of them landing into the exclusive economic zones of Japan and the Philippines. Beijing also embraced limited economic punishments against Taiwan and canceled and postponed select areas of U.S.-China engagement and cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA Eastern Theater Command reported that it sent the Type 054A frigate Xiangtan, Type 052D guided-missile destroyer Taiyuan, and Type 956EM destroyer Taizhou to conduct live-fire combat exercises in the East China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was reported that a combined arms brigade of the PLA Ground Force based in Guangdong received a large delivery of Type 08 wheeled armored vehicles, which are necessary for “rapid-reaction combat including rapid deployment and mobilized assault missions.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to an announcement by the Liaoning Maritime Safety Administration (MSA), military exercises in the Yellow Sea and Bohai region began on April 2 and continued through April 9.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;monday-april-3&quot;&gt;Monday, April 3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was reported that the Hainan, a Type 075 amphibious assault ship, carried out a joint sea-air exercise in waters to the west of China’s Guangdong Province. Official Chinese media directly linked this and other exercises to Tsai’s planned meeting with McCarthy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Hainan MSA announced live-fire exercises would be held in an area off of the island’s northeastern coast from April 4–6.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;tuesday-april-4&quot;&gt;Tuesday, April 4&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;14 PLA aircraft and 3 naval vessels were detected around Taiwan by Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense (MND). Two of the detected aircraft entered Taiwan’s southwest ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was reported that a combined arms brigade under the PLA 72nd Group Army held a combat-oriented beach assault exercise. The 72nd Group Army is an amphibious force that is responsible for cross-sea landing missions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force observed the Type 052C destroyer Changchun sailing northwest through the waters between Yonaguni Island and Taiwan on April 4. It then sailed northward through waters approximately 70 km west of the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands on April 5. The vessel had previously sailed south through the waters between the main island of Okinawa and Miyako Island on April 3.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;wednesday-april-5&quot;&gt;Wednesday, April 5&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China announced a three-day “special joint patrol and inspection operation” in the central and northern areas of the Taiwan Strait. As part of this operation, Chinese maritime law enforcement officials were tasked with conducting on-site inspections (现场检查) aboard vessels in the Taiwan Strait, but there were no reports of such on-site inspections taking place. The operation was led by China’s first large-scale patrol vessel in the Taiwan Strait, the Haixun 06. Vessels from the Fujian Maritime Safety Administration, East China Sea Rescue Bureau and the East China Sea Maritime Security Center joined. Notably, the first law enforcement patrol the Haixun 06 embarked on occurred during then-Speaker of the House Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August 2022. In response to Haixun 06’s April 2023 operations, Taiwan’s Maritime and Port Bureau issued a statement that relevant shipping companies have been told to refuse these inspections.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA Navy’s Shandong aircraft carrier passed through the Bashi Channel and into waters off of Taiwan’s southeastern coast for long-range training in the West Pacific. Japan’s Ministry of Defense (MoD) reported that the Shandong was accompanied by the Type 054A frigate Liuzhou and the Chaganhu, a Type 901 fast combat support ship. The ships traveled eastward in an area 186 miles south of Hateruma Island. Japanese guided-missile destroyer Sawagiri shadowed the carrier group. Notably, the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier was sailing about 400 nautical miles east of Taiwan that day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A PLA news site reported that a vessel-borne helicopter regiment affiliated with the PLA Eastern Theater Command Navy carried out landing exercises during both day and night on the Type 075 amphibious assault ship Guangxi over several days.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force observed the Type 054A frigate Anyang sailing northwest in the waters between Yonaguni Island and Taiwan on April 5. It then sailed northward through the waters between Yonaguni Island and Taiwan, and then sailed northward through the waters approximately 80 km west of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands on April 6. The vessel had previously sailed south through the waters between the main island of Okinawa and Miyako on April 3.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;friday-april-7&quot;&gt;Friday, April 7&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fujian MSA announced that live-fire drills would be held off the northern coast of Pingtan Island on April 10 for 13 hours. The exercise zone covers an area of approximately 39 square kilometers (15 square miles). At its closest point, the exercise zone is approximately 30 kilometers (19 miles) from Dongju Island, the southernmost island of Taiwan’s Matsu Islands. However, the announcement was later removed from the MSA website, raising questions about whether the exercises took place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fujian MSA also announced live-fire drills would be held in Luoyuan Bay, northwest of Taiwan’s Matsu Islands. The drills were scheduled from 8 am – 12 pm on April 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 20. However, the announcement was later removed from the MSA website, raising questions about whether the exercises took place or will later in April.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan’s MoD reported that China’s Shandong aircraft carrier and its escort ships were approximately 242 miles (390 km) south of the Japanese island of Miyako.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Liaoning MSA announced three military exercises that would occur in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea. Exercises were scheduled for 8 hours on April 8 and 10 hours on April 9. Immediately following the April 9 exercise, another exercise would begin that same day, from April 9 to April 16.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;saturday-april-8&quot;&gt;Saturday, April 8&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At 8:16 am Beijing time, the PLA Eastern Theater Command (ETC) announced that from April 8–10, it would “organize combat readiness patrols around Taiwan Island and conduct “Joint Sword” exercises in the Taiwan Strait, around the northern and southern parts of Taiwan Island, and in the sea and airspace to the east of Taiwan Island.” At 10:01 am, the ETC repeated the announcement, adding that the exercises are “a serious warning against ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces’ collusion and provocation with external forces, and a necessary action to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.” The exercises involved joint operations across the PLA Army, Navy, Air Force, and Rocket Forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the first day, the exercises focused on testing the PLA’s capability to seize control of sea, air, and information domains under the support of the joint combat system. PLA Navy frigates and destroyers practiced short-range assaults, long-range deterrence, and air defense and anti-missile drills. There were also joint anti-submarine drills with cooperation from police patrol boats. Dozens of J-16 and J-10C fighters carried out live ammunition and medium and long range air combat drills with the support of early warning aircraft, jammers, and refueling aircraft. PLA Rocket Force conventional missile brigades were also dispatched.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of the exercises, the Type 052D destroyer Taiyuan reportedly came within 24 nautical miles of Taiwan Island — the point where Taiwan’s contiguous zone starts. This suggests Chinese vessels are operating increasingly close to the island; however, there are no reports of vessels entering Taiwan’s territorial waters (which extend 12 nautical miles from Taiwan’s territorial baseline).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s MND reported that by 11 am, 42 PLA aircraft and 8 vessels were detected in areas around Taiwan. Later, Taiwan’s MND reported a total of 71 aircraft and 9 vessels around Taiwan. Up to this point, this was by far the highest figure reported in 2023, and tied for the highest ever recorded.2 Of these, 45 aircraft crossed the southern, central, and northern areas of the Taiwan Strait median line and entered into the southwest ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan’s MoD reported that the Shandong was over 267 miles (430 km) south of Miyako Island.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reportedly, a PLA amphibious landing ship carried out live-fire exercises just 30 miles (50 km) northwest of the Matsu Islands in the Luoyuan Bay. The vessel “fired shells at targets on land and at sea.” This aligned with an April 7 announcement by the Fujian MSA of a series of exercises over several days in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;sunday-april-9&quot;&gt;Sunday, April 9&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China continued with large-scale exercises around the island. According to a CCTV report, “Under the unified command of the theater’s Joint Operations Command Center, multiple types of units carried out simulated joint precision strikes against key targets on Taiwan Island and the surrounding waters, and continued to maintain the momentum of encircling the island.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of the exercise, several PLA aircraft and vessels worked jointly to create a “shore-sea-air joint strike system.” The PLA also released an animation that depicts several land-based assets, aircraft, and vessels launching joint precision strikes at key targets on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to reports, about 20 vessels — half from China and half from Taiwan — were engaged in a stand-off near the median line that divides the Taiwan Strait. However, details about the situation remain scant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan MND reported that a total of 70 PLA aircraft and 11 vessels had been detected around Taiwan that day. Of these aircraft, 35 crossed the southern, central, and northern areas of the Taiwan Strait median line and entered the southwest and southeast ADIZ. Notably, four J-15 fighters took off from the Shandong aircraft carrier and entered Taiwan’s southeastern ADIZ, marking the first time J-15s have entered the ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Japanese MoD reported that the Shandong had moved north, coming within 142 miles (230 km) of Miyako Island.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the final day of the “Joint Sword” exercises, CCTV reporting noted that drills focused on “joint shock and deterrence and island closure and control” (联合震慑，孤岛封控). This emphasized maneuvers to cut of access to the island from seas east of Taiwan. Several destroyers and frigates carried out suppressive combat patrol missions and joint blockade simulations, and the Shandong aircraft carrier group participated in the final day of drills from the waters east of Taiwan. The carrier group consisted of one Type 055 destroyer, one Type 052D destroyer, two Type 054A frigates, one Type 901 replenishment ship, and there was likely a nuclear-powered attack submarine as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s MND reported a record-high number of PLA aircraft around Taiwan. A total of 91 aircraft and 12 vessels had been detected. Of those aircraft, 54 crossed the Taiwan Strait median line or entered Taiwan’s southwest and southeast ADIZ. For the second day in a row, J-15 fighters entered the southeast ADIZ after presumably launching from the Shandong carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan’s MoD announced that between April 7-9, the Shandong carrier launched a total of roughly 120 sorties, including about 80 aircraft and 40 helicopter sorties. Japan’s MoD also announced that since March 28, the PLA Type 815A electronic reconnaissance vessel Kaiyangxing had been circling Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shortly after 6 pm, the ETC announced the successful conclusion of the “joint cruise and patrol special operation” in the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;tuesday-april-11&quot;&gt;Tuesday, April 11&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The day after the conclusion of the “Joint Sword” exercises, Taiwan’s MND reported it had detected 26 aircraft and nine vessels carrying out combat readiness patrols. In total, 35 aircraft and 8 vessels detected in the region, and 15 of these aircraft entered Taiwan’s ADIZ or crossed the Taiwan Strait median line.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reuters stated that there were small-scale military exercises occurring off the coast of Fuzhou, which were likely part of the previously announced exercises by Fujian MSA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan’s MoD reported that the Shandong aircraft carrier was about 180 miles (290 km) from Japan’s Miyako Island.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;wednesday-april-12&quot;&gt;Wednesday, April 12&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s Ministry of Transportation and Communication reported that on April 11, China had issued a no-fly zone due to “aerospace activities” that China would be conducting in a busy region of airspace north of Taiwan from April 16 to 18, from 9 am to 2 pm each day. China then reduced the timeframe to just 27 minutes, from 9:30 am to 9:57 am on April 16. This zone overlaps within Taiwan’s ADIZ and is just 85 nautical miles from Taiwan’s northern coast. Taiwan’s Central News Agency reported that China’s modified “no fly zone” will impact 33 flights in total.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s MND reported 26 PLA aircraft and 7 PLAN vessels around Taiwan. A total of 14 aircraft crossed the Taiwan Strait median line.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s Shandong carrier group was still operating in the West Pacific, 137 miles (220 km) south of Japan’s Miyako Island.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;thursday-april-13&quot;&gt;Thursday, April 13&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China announced a new warning related to a zone north of Taiwan. The Fujian MSA announced that vessels should not enter the zone due to the possibility of falling rocket debris from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm on Sunday, April 16.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Hainan MSA announced four-day military exercises from April 16–19 in the South China Sea northeast of Hainan Island.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s MND reported that it detected 4 PLA aircraft and 8 naval vessels around Taiwan. One aircraft entered Taiwan’s southwest ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Shandong carrier group moved southeast, further into the West Pacific. Japan’s MoD tracked the group almost 286 miles (460 km) south-southeast of Miyako Island.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;friday-april-14&quot;&gt;Friday, April 14&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s MND reported 6 PLA aircraft and 4 navy vessels around the island. Two PLA aircraft crossed the median line or entered Taiwan’s SW ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regarding the airspace and maritime closure zone announced for April 16, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin stated that reports describing it as a “no-fly zone” was “not accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s Shandong carrier continued moving east away from Taiwan and reportedly was 323 miles (520 km) south-west of the Japanese-administers Okinotorishima reef.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s MND reported 8 PLA aircraft and 5 PLAN vessels around the island. 3 aircraft crossed the Taiwan Strait median line or entered Taiwan’s ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;saturday-april-15&quot;&gt;Saturday, April 15&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan’s MoD reported that the Shandong carrier group was 230 miles (370 km) Southeast of Okinotorishima reef in the West Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense observed 15 PLA aircraft and 4 PLAN vessels around Taiwan. Four of the PLA aircraft entered the southeast and southwest portions of Taiwan’s ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;sunday-april-16&quot;&gt;Sunday, April 16&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese authorities announced the successful launch of a Long March-4B rocket that was carrying a meteorological satellite (Fengyun-3 07, also referred to as Fengyun-3G) from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Gansu Province. Debris from the launch was later detected in the previously announced maritime and airspace closure zone. The zone was reportedly free of aircraft between 9:30–10:20 am.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Shandong carrier was tracked by the Japanese MoD 441 miles (710 km) south-southeast of Okinotorishima reef. Additionally, Japan’s MoD reported that aircraft based on the Shandong conducted 210 sorties from April 10-16, and from April 7–16, there was a total of 330 sorties. Japan scrambled fighter jets in response to this activity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The USS Milius Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer sailed through the Taiwan Strait, just a week after it sailed past Chinese man-made islands in the South China Sea. China’s Ministry of Foreign affairs accused the United States of disrupting peace in the Strait. The PLA Eastern Theater Command also issued a statement and ensured that they will “resolutely defend national sovereignty and regional peace.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s MND reported 18 PLA aircraft and 4 PLAN vessels around Taiwan Island. Four PLA aircraft entered Taiwan’s southwest and southeast ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;monday-april-17&quot;&gt;Monday, April 17&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Qingdao Maritime Safety Administration announced 3 hours of “major” military activities on April 18 in an area of the Yellow Sea. The coordinates for the exercise indicate an area along the coast of the port city of Qingdao, but further details of the exercises were not released.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s MND reported 12 PLA aircraft and 4 PLAN vessels around Taiwan Island. Four of the aircraft entered Taiwan’s southwest ADIZ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;tuesday-april-18&quot;&gt;Tuesday, April 18&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New reports indicated that Taiwan plans to purchase up to 400 U.S.-made land-launched Harpoon missiles as part of deal approved in 2020 by the United States Congress. The U.S. Defense Department announced the $1.7 billion contract with Boeing on April 7 but did not indicate then that Taiwan is the purchaser.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reportedly, China conducted a military drill in the Yellow Sea that started April 18 at 9:00 am local time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;timeline-of-key-chinese-diplomatic-and-non-military-activities&quot;&gt;Timeline of Key Chinese Diplomatic and Non-Military Activities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to its military activities, China’s direct diplomatic and non-military responses escalated after the Tsai-McCarthy meeting. From April 6 onwards, China embraced sanctions on select U.S. and Taiwan entities. Beijing, however, appears to be balancing its desire to punish Tsai and the current government in Taipei with a broader imperative to increase various forms of economic and political exchanges between China and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;tuesday-april-4-1&quot;&gt;Tuesday, April 4&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One day prior to the Tsai-McCarthy meeting, the congressional liaison at the Chinese embassy in Washington Li Xiang sent an email to members of Congress who would be in attendance at the meeting, urging them to not meet with Tsai. Li warned that China opposes “any form of official interaction between the US and Taiwan” and that China “will most likely take necessary and resolute actions in response.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;thursday-april-6&quot;&gt;Thursday, April 6&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a highly orchestrated public move, four major Chinese government actors and departments each issued public statements denouncing Tsai’s transit and meeting with Speaker McCarthy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s top legislative body, the National People’s Congress, asserted, “The action of McCarthy, the third highest-ranking official of the U.S. government, has seriously broken the commitment made by the United States to China on the Taiwan question” and it reiterated that “the Taiwan issue” is “the first red line that must not be crossed in China-U.S. relations.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) issued a statement that warned that “‘Taiwan independence’ and cross-Strait peace and stability are as irreconcilable as fire and water,” promising that “the pursuit of ‘Taiwan independence’ will lead nowhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The State Council’s Taiwan Affairs Office condemned the “DPP authorities” who “promote Taiwan-US collusion.” It noted that Tsai and the DPP are pushing Taiwan toward a dangerous brink of potential conflict. The office warned that it “will take firm measures to punish the ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces and their actions” and “any act of seeking ‘independence’ will be smashed to pieces under the powerful force of the Chinese sons and daughters to oppose ‘independence’ and promote reunification.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s MND issued a statement saying that the PLA “sticks to its duties and missions” and “resolutely defends national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;friday-april-7-1&quot;&gt;Friday, April 7&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Taiwan Work Office issued sanctions on certain institutions and individuals in both Taiwan and the United States. Hsiao Bi-khim, Taiwan’s representative to the United States, was sanctioned for a second time. The sanctions bar her from entering mainland China, Hong Kong, or Macao due to her “diehard” support for “Taiwan independence.” China also sanctioned the leaders of Taiwan’s Prospect Foundation (a think tank focusing on cross-Strait relations) and the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats (a regional organization of liberal democratic political parties in Asia). In the United States, China sanctioned the Hudson Institute and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, and specific administrators at each organization, freezing any assets they had in China and barring them from entering the country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a MFA press conference, spokesperson Mao Ning emphasized that “the Taiwan question is not about democracy, but about China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” claiming “the sovereignty and territory of China have never been divided and shall never be divided.” She asserted that “the future of Taiwan lies in China’s reunification, and the wellbeing of the people in Taiwan hinges on the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;monday-april-10-1&quot;&gt;Monday, April 10&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said “the combat readiness security patrol encircling the Taiwan Island and the ‘Joint Sword’ exercises is a stern warning to the provocative activities of ‘Taiwan independence’”secessionist forces and their collusion with external forces,” highlighting the exercises as “a necessary move to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wang Huning, a Politburo Standing Committee member and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, met with a delegation of Taiwan business executives led by Liu Chao-shiuan, co-president of the Cross-Strait CEO Summit in Beijing. Wang messaged the desire for improved economic and trade exchanges and that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait “cannot be realized with the existence of ‘Taiwan independence.’”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;wednesday-april-12-1&quot;&gt;Wednesday, April 12&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;China’s Ministry of Commerce announced it was launching an investigation into Taiwan’s trade restrictions on over 2,400 mainland goods at the request of several trade groups. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council warned that the investigation will not improve cross-strait trade but make future cooperation more difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;趙家賢稱無規定以投票達共識、戴耀廷會私下游說 指李永成為民主黨代表惟辯方指已離黨&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;趙家賢稱黃之鋒朱凱廸倡簽共同綱領 稱辦初選「當自己係選管會主席」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8f1iKnI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（17日）踏入審訊第44天。趙家賢繼續接受盤問，確認各區各有共識，惟就如何達成並無任何規則。法官關注如何處理分歧，趙指戴耀廷會邀請各方講解想法，會後亦會私下游說，「佢揸住架 MINI Cooper 可以周圍走」；又指若仍未能達共識，投票可算是「解決死局」的做法，惟承認從沒規定採納「少數服從多數」原則。趙又供稱第二次新東會議民主黨代表是李永成，惟辯方指李於2018年底、2019年初已退黨，趙指「完全冇印象」，向法官和辯方表示「唔好意思」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙今同意提名表格稱要認同的「協調會議共識」不包括當選後行為，與上周稱包括否決預算案不同；又強調如何得出共識與民主動力無關，惟再被法官引帖文質疑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢確認各區各有共識無跨區會議或溝通-惟戴耀廷望達至統一&quot;&gt;趙家賢確認各區各有共識、無跨區會議或溝通 惟戴耀廷望達至統一&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢繼續接受代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文盤問。辯方今就提名表格發問，趙確認表格由民主動力設計，他批准後再交戴耀廷審閱，最後才交所有參選人使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示九龍西黃碧雲的提名表格，趙同意初選未曾開過任何跨區會議，或有所有參選人一同溝通的群組，故就表格上「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」的條款，「協調會議共識」僅指參選人所屬選區的共識，在黃碧雲而言即九龍西。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，每區均有各自的共識和條款，如新界西望投票人數達致某一數目才生效，故提名表格是較「綜合性」的寫法。法官李運騰問，但組織者也嘗試在各區達致某種一致性？趙同意，指九龍東起初打算用棄選機制，惟在協調會議過程不同選區或有報告，「大家喺傾嘅過程慢慢聚焦咗喺某啲共識之中。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，故即使原本計劃每區有各自的共識，如出選名單數目和目標票數不同，但組織者有意達成某種一致性（uniformity）？趙答：「我留意到戴耀廷召開協調會議嘅一啲講法，係有呢個意圖喺當中」，並同意因此最終各區都同意進行初選，和統一為投一票，亦因當時政局情況而設有替補機制等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱非中委成員-以其權限得知民主黨內同意參與初選&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱非中委成員 以其權限得知民主黨內同意參與初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問同為民主黨黨員的趙家賢，民主黨曾否討論在「35+計劃」要同意或不同意什麼事項？趙指，他當時任民主黨東區黨團召集人、並非中央委員，而在民主黨用作工作交流的 WhatsApp 群組，他留意到「大家知道個情況係需要有個初選」，以減少正式選舉時民主陣營「互相鬥爭、chur票」；大家亦「同意民主黨係會參與初選」，及若初選未能出線，有關人士就不會參與正式選舉。趙並指：「而我當時嘅權限或我嘅角色，只可以知道呢啲訊息去提供協助處理今次嘅案件。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱就如何達共識無書面或口頭規則-曾信戴用調解員方式促進溝通惟發現無應用&quot;&gt;趙稱就如何達共識無書面或口頭規則 曾信戴用調解員方式促進溝通惟發現無應用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後就會上如何達成共識發問。趙確認，從2020年3月至他於7月退出「35+」，與戴耀廷、區諾軒、黎敬輝、鍾錦麟均有恆常溝通，並補充鍾在6月中因孩子出生，「我就叫佢作為一家之主，呢啲時候你照顧屋企多啲啦」，故鍾「冇乜參與」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Dx3OHZ2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鍾錦麟（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續問在整個計劃中，就如何達成共識，有否任何書面的規則？趙確認以其認知和就民主動力而言，「係完全冇呢種文件出現過」；而在他與組織者或任何人的溝通中，亦「從來沒有聽過」有人談及相關規則，亦無以書面或口頭稱會以投票達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，那趙有提議任何規則嗎？趙指「我冇特別去建議」，因為他得知戴耀廷曾去過美國哈佛大學「就讀過我哋調解界最希望讀到嘅殿堂級課程，就係 Programme of Negotitaion」，並曾分享一些調解界認知的客觀準則和操守。趙續指，因認知戴有修讀有關調解專業的知識和技巧，「所以我當時真誠地確信，佢係應該會用調解員嗰種嘅方式，一個促進嘅形式去處理呢個35+整個嘅協調工作」，如訂立一些會議規則和有共同基礎，不過他開會時留意到「唔係好覺得佢有應用到我哋調解嘅呢啲技巧同做法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官關注如何處理分歧-趙指戴曾會後找與會者傾佢揸住架mini-cooper可周圍走&quot;&gt;官關注如何處理分歧 趙指戴曾會後找與會者傾：佢揸住架MINI Cooper可周圍走&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續確認，在計劃中從沒有聽過以「少數服從多數」原則達成共識，並同意「廣義」而言，表格條款中「共識」一字只是指「共同理解（common understanding）」。法官李運騰指「共同理解」不一定代表有同一意見，續問那當會上有分歧會如何處理？是由得分歧存在？游說或強迫其他人？抑或其他？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙回應，當時觀察到不同光譜表達意見時，「係會有少少南轅北轍」，而戴耀廷主持會議時也有邀請各方詳細講解他們要求背後的思維想法或原則，以調解角度而言「即係佢嘗試透過呢啲提問去達致相互理解」。李運騰指，理解不代表同意，再問即如何處理分歧？趙指留意到戴曾向某些與會者稱「我會後再特別走過嚟你個區、你個議員辦事處同你傾啦」。李問，即有一些私下的游說？趙指「冇錯，一嚟佢揸住架 MINI Cooper 可以周圍走啦」，林卓廷笑說「嘩」，趙續指戴經常與該些與會者傾談和吃飯，了解更多當時政治狀況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指若仍未達共識-投票可解決死局-惟戴規則好臨時性事前不知會投票&quot;&gt;趙指若仍未達共識 投票可「解決死局」 惟戴規則「好臨時性」、事前不知會投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，若戴耀廷已窮盡所有方法，仍未能達成共識，舉例他不認為戴能說服司馬文或岑子杰同意運用否決權，那這個時候就會用「意向性投票」解決？趙同意曾試過很多營造共識的溝通方式，並重申據他向助手了解，新東和新西曾進行意向性投票。趙指以他「調解員」的認知而言，「做咗咁多嘢，如果件事情想繼續推進、有個方案做到嘅話」，在參與持分者很多下，正式投票或意向性投票「係一個叫做去解決嗰個死局嘅做法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟趙強調，以他調解員的認知，若要用投票形式，事前一定要談好規則，「因為一般人 expect 係覺得應該大家得到共識，就唔係多數壓住咗少數去做」；惟他認為據戴耀廷所述，似乎就如何投票的規則是「好臨時性，冇話之前點樣傾得好仔細」。法官陳慶偉指，雖投票規則是臨時，但區議會主席也可做見證。趙同意，並指區議會主席絕不會參與立法會選舉、無利益衝突，有高度公信力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指新東第二次會議民主黨代表為李永成-辯方指李當時已離黨&quot;&gt;趙指新東第二次會議民主黨代表為李永成 辯方指李當時已離黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙上周供稱，5月5日新東第二次會議曾進行意向性投票，通過使用「會運用」。他確認在該次會議前「我冇見過、冇認知會有投票呢樣嘢」，並同意會上就否決預算案有「拉扯」，林卓廷亦不在場。區諾軒早前稱林卓廷該次會議的代表是莊榮輝，惟趙則稱是李永成。沈士文向趙指出，林卓廷在該次會議的代表是莊榮輝。趙顯得疑惑，並指據助手的會議筆記，民主黨代表是李永成，但其後確認他不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上其後展示黎敬輝的筆記，提及李永成有發言，趙指李2020年5月時是民主黨沙田區議員，但不能確定他是否仍任民主黨中央委員。惟沈士文指，李其實於2018年底、2019年初已離開民主黨，趙指「我完全冇印象呢件事情，唔好意思法官閣下同沈大狀」，有被告大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lZhWFrZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 李永成（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，黎敬輝筆記提及有民主黨代表在場，故趙不能排除林卓廷當時是由其他人代表？趙指若當時他「搞錯咗」李永成代表民主黨，「咁即係嗰個會議一定有民主黨代表，但我唔知邊個係」，並指與助手溝通時，亦沒有特別提到莊榮輝在場。但趙確認，首次新東會議莊榮輝代表林卓廷，莊曾稱不獲授權投票，而黎敬輝曾提及第二次會議與會者「同上次大部分差唔多」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙錄影會面曾稱協調會議共識僅指初選-不包括當選後行為&quot;&gt;趙錄影會面曾稱協調會議共識僅指初選 不包括當選後行為&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續引趙家賢於2021年6月29日首次錄影會面，被問表格上「協調會議共識」指什麼，趙指各區就出選名單數目等有不同，而表格要「一致性」，故寫法「籠統」。他又指當時會議共識就是「大家係願意參與初選」，而條款「唔係講緊要入到立法會、要點做呀嗰啲嘅共識，係講緊其實只係希望為民主陣營爭取集中票源，減少出選隊伍，增加多啲議席咁樣」，「當然之後佢哋有額外再簽其他嗰啲就係另外一回事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認上述是民主動力的看法，重申民動理解「共識」範圍只限於參與初選、集中票源。他並確認，提名表格是於戴耀廷在6月9日記者會稱不用簽聲明，翌日「墨落無悔」發布後才正式落實，強調「墨落無悔」與組織者無關，並同意他「絕對反對」綑綁參選人入立會後的行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙強調共識如何得出與民動無關-官引fb帖文質疑-趙稱職員有fb權限逾月後始察出事&quot;&gt;趙強調共識如何得出與民動無關 官引FB帖文質疑 趙稱職員有FB權限、逾月後始察「出事」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文問，因此趙家賢作為表格的設計者，使用「協調會議共識」字眼只是指他對計劃的初心，而非關乎當選後的行為？趙重申「其實我寫落去係用緊『九二共識，一中各表（一個中國，各自表述）』呢種籠統嘅寫法去寫」，而字眼上提及「戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識」，而非「民主動力」支持的共識，是因就該共識的解讀，他和民主動力有上述看法。陳慶偉問，即趙認為戴和區有共同共識？趙指不會這樣說，因程序上他們是會議協調人，「其實呢個寫法有個隱含意思，就係佢哋嗰時共識點傾，總之同民主動力無關嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟法官陳仲衡主動引趙家賢6月9日的Facebook帖文截圖，提及「民主派35+公民投票」目標就是為了奪取過半議席，「光復立法會，奪回控制權，壓制港共政權」。趙重申，上述眾籌頁面內容由兼職同事撰寫，他認為「出咗事」，又指「無論點樣都好，我作為組織嘅召集人負責人，都有責任去承擔嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳質疑若然如此，趙又將帖文於Facebook發布。趙回應，其職員有民主動力和他個人Facebook的權限，會協助他進行宣傳，兩個專頁「一雞兩味」。趙續指，「法官閣下我想提一提，民主動力係蚊型組織，當日記者會後除咗訪問都有好多工作要做，咁而嗰陣時網上啲嘢我就交咗畀同事去負責…整個過程當中啲時間係好緊密嘅，坦白講唔可能所有嘢都係我親手做、所有嘢都係我親自處理同安排晒。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳問當時他有否閱讀該帖文，趙指「睇咗開頭」，將眾籌金額由400萬改為350萬；至於全篇文章，他是直至7月14日得知戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步〉一文後，開始檢視民主動力各方面的資料，才看到眾籌版面「出咗事」。陳問，即趙家賢在帖文發布一個月後才首次閱畢？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xcmz5In.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（17日）踏入審訊第44天。趙家賢繼續接受盤問，他曾於警方錄影會面表示，鄒家成等發布「墨落無悔」，令部分溫和民主派被逼「跟住個政治大勢」簽署，而戴耀廷曾指九龍東黃之鋒及新界西朱凱廸均叫同區其他候選人簽協議，最終兩區以戴草擬、無公開的共同綱領為藍本修訂，並在報名時夾附已簽署的共同綱領。趙亦曾於錄影會面稱因林卓廷代表在新東會議「反對攬炒」，故深信新東「肯定唔會」簽署相關文件，惟他今改稱民主黨代表當時僅提出「關注和顧慮」，林卓廷驚訝說「吓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙透露承辦初選時無就「35+計劃」與民主黨黨友黃碧雲及林卓廷直接聯繫，指他有「行事嘅道德準則」，雖只是辦民間初選仍「當自己係選管會主席嚟做」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴起草共同綱領後很多泛民唔制墨落無悔逼溫和民主派跟大勢簽署&quot;&gt;趙稱戴起草共同綱領後很多泛民「唔制」、「墨落無悔」逼溫和民主派跟大勢簽署&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢繼續接受代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文盤問。辯方引趙家賢於2021年6月29日首次錄影會面謄本，趙曾提及戴耀廷起草各區「共同綱領」後曾發給許多人，「當然傳統嘅民主派好多都唔制喇」，他和區諾軒遂向戴反映，「好堅持我哋覺得唔應該參與個初選係有呢啲前設嘅嘢要簽」，戴並同意。趙確認上述內容，並指望將「唔制」改為「好多關注、好多顧慮」；並同意有上述看法是因認為初選不應綑綁當選後的行為。法官陳仲衡一度指，趙只是說反對簽署協議，而非反對有前設，趙補充他亦曾表達入議會後議員應自主行事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續在會面稱，在初選記者會後，有三人發起「墨落無悔」並在社交媒體向市民宣傳他們看法和價值觀，「其實就逼到好多一啲溫和民主陣營嘅人士…跟住個政治大勢，你唔簽嘅話，就可能會得失咗一啲支持者嘞，咁所以都有部分係簽咗嘅嗰陣時」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，到了初選提名期，本身毋須簽任何協議，但好明顯九東和新西的本土抗爭派，「會逼番嗰個區裏面嘅其他候選人」，稱「喂，嗱，你橫掂『墨落無悔』嗰度有啲都簽咗喇…大家都應該要支持嗰陣時喺嗰個協調會議，我哋想倡議嘅嘢」，趙盤問下確認倡議是指運用否決權。趙並指，戴之後向他指九龍東黃之鋒，及新界西朱凱廸都有叫其他人簽協議，他最終亦按戴指示照收該兩區的聲明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡一度問發起「墨落無悔」的三人是誰，趙指包括鄒家成、張可森，其後思考近10秒指另一位是「香港島嘅參選人」，鄒家成發笑，趙在辯方提問下確認是梁晃維。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙引戴耀廷指九東黃之鋒及新西朱凱廸倡簽協議-以戴發出協議為藍本&quot;&gt;趙引戴耀廷指九東黃之鋒及新西朱凱廸倡簽協議 以戴發出協議為藍本&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，當時本土抗爭派嘗試游說較溫和一方同意運用否決權，而戴耀廷曾以電話向他表示，九龍東和新界西大部分候選人都有「好強烈意見」想「實體地白紙黑字簽一份嘢」，並特別提到九東是由黃之鋒、新西是由朱凱廸倡議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jatzdos.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前排：朱凱廸（左）、黃之鋒（中）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在2021年7月21日的第二次錄影會面，曾稱黃之鋒等人「佢哋都會覺得係要有番份嘢簽出嚟嘅」，趙指他們是以戴耀廷6月8日發出的各區協議最後版本作為「藍本」，將該份毋須簽署的不公開文件進行修訂和「加加減減」，寫成該兩區最後額外簽署的聲明。趙並指，他很清楚向戴表明這是戴作為協調人跟與會者的溝通，而本身民主動力接收的官方文件不包括此，「因為你嘅意思而收㗎啫」，戴則稱「收咗你照存放得啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢確認謄本出錯-應為新界東肯定唔會簽文件-而非肯定會&quot;&gt;趙家賢確認謄本出錯 應為新界東「肯定唔會」簽文件 而非「肯定會」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據該謄本，被問為何除了九龍東和新界西，其他區又沒有簽額外聲明時，趙指各區做法不同，並指就新界東，「特別直情係林卓廷個代表都話咗反對攬炒、即係諗住係無差別否決財政預算案，因為你冇理由起醫院都反對呀，咁所以我深信所以新界東就『肯定會』有一啲呢類型嘅文件會簽出嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文指翻聽片段後發現謄本有錯，句子中的「會」應為「唔會」，在延伸庭的黃之鋒邊聽邊激動說話，被告席又傳來驚嘆的「吓！」聲音。沈續在庭上播出片段，趙確認應為「肯定唔會」，又一度稱「我發現警方搵嗰間外判間嘢（謄寫公司）係好有問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙修改錄影會面說法-指民主黨代表在新東非反對攬炒僅提疑問&quot;&gt;趙修改錄影會面說法 指民主黨代表在新東非「反對攬炒」、僅提疑問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問趙是否維持說法，趙指望刪去「反對攬炒」，並改為指「林卓廷個代表都就住無差別否決財政預算案表達咗關注同顧慮」。林卓廷大聲說「吓」，「有得咁？」，又與鄒家成相視而笑。趙解釋，當時其實沒有聽到「反對攬炒」的字眼，指民主黨代表是就無差別否決預算案提出「關注和顧慮」，又指民主黨代表僅提出「疑問」，即關注是否連起醫院、學校也反對，林卓廷再面露驚訝稱「吓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指司馬文比民主黨代表更清楚反對否決財案&quot;&gt;趙指司馬文比民主黨代表更清楚反對否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問到，因此是提出疑問多於反對？趙同意，並主動提出香港島的司馬文作對比，指司馬文便好清楚表明反對「為否決而否決」。趙又指，司馬文當時是公共專業聯盟的主席，「提名曾俊華選特首嗰個」，自己也是該組織的執委會成員，聯盟亦清楚反對否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在法官詢問下確認，司馬文當時計劃參加香港島初選，但最終沒有參與，因為聯盟的商界及中小企對於否決財政預算案「完全覺得係好詫異」。李運騰問，聯盟是否不接受「會運用」或「會積極運用」的字眼？趙表示：「應該話佢哋就財政預算案唔同細節位，係會同政府有個商討。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙終同意，由於林卓廷代表當時清楚表達對否決預算案的關注和顧慮，故肯定新界東不會簽署該類文件；加上他當時是民主黨黨員，以他在黨的身分地位所收到黨政策的訊息，均認為因此新東不會有該協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙無就協調與黃碧雲林卓廷溝通-稱有道德準則我會當自己係選管會主席嚟做&quot;&gt;趙無就協調與黃碧雲林卓廷溝通 稱有道德準則：我會當自己係選管會主席嚟做&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙家賢早前提及，於新東第二次會議後曾向戴耀廷反映民主黨代表不獲授權投票，戴稱會處理民主黨的關注，惟趙在盤問下同意，他並不知道戴有沒有真的這樣做。沈士文指出，事實上林卓廷、黃碧雲和他們的代表，從來沒有與戴耀廷就此有直接或間接接觸，趙指他不知道，但重提區諾軒曾向他指，戴「係充分獲得傳統民主派元老嘅授權」，此時林卓廷「O嘴」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，「元老」包括李永達和李卓人，指他們授權予戴耀廷做協調，「而並不是本身多年嚟協助傳統民主派做協調嘅民主動力去做」，故當時自然認知他們有緊密溝通，亦因此沒追問戴有否處理民主黨問題。法官陳仲衡問，那林卓廷和黃碧雲有否向趙提出跟進？趙指沒有與二人有直接聯繫，即使他同為民主黨黨員，「因為我自己會有一個行事嘅道德準則，咁當時承辦緊個初選，雖然係民間初選，但我會當自己係選管會主席嚟做」，林卓廷和鄒家成發笑。趙續確認，他就「35+計劃」從沒有與林和黃接觸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指戴耀廷獲李永達李卓人等元老授權辦協調-惟指二人不認同否決財案&quot;&gt;趙指戴耀廷獲李永達李卓人等元老授權辦協調 惟指二人不認同否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙其後確認，區提及戴獲民主派元老授權是在3月26日首次35+記招後，當時趙因被「排除在外」而向區了解情況。沈士文續指，李永達和李卓人就「35+計劃」的參與只是2020年初，與否決預算案無關。惟陳慶偉質疑1月的飯局上，戴耀廷已曾提及「大殺傷力憲制武器」，並改為問李卓人和李永達是否從來不認同（endorse）否決預算案？趙確認，指二人是授權戴耀廷進行立法會選舉嘅協調。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱心理狀態都好不穩定-故在警誡會面中將事情混淆&quot;&gt;趙稱「心理狀態都好不穩定」 故在警誡會面中將事情混淆&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙家賢在第二次錄影會面被問及「無差別」否決預算案的意思，趙表示鄒家成與林卓廷的代表曾於會議辯論，鄒提出一定要全面否決，但林卓廷的代表質疑：「係咪連個財政預算案，包括要起醫院呢啲你都否決？呢啲係一啲唔關政治嘅、一啲好民生嘅事項㗎喎。」因此趙指「無差別」並非討論預算案的細項是否需調整，而是要透過否決去啟動《基本法》條款，令行政長官解散立法會和辭職。趙確認是指4月14日的新東首次會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方亦問及除初選籌辦者的群組外，還有沒有其他關於初選的群組，當時趙回應戴開了7個 WhatsApp 群組，包括5個地區直選、超級區議會及衞生服務界，而由於傳統民主派與抗爭派就否決預算案的意見南轅北轍，故戴以群組作更新及發布訊息之用，如在選舉前通知「最新嘅情況咁樣啦，大家唔使簽嘢㗎啦」，趙確認戴確實在會上稱不需簽署文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文問趙是否維持當時說法，趙表示「當時我相信我嘅記憶」，但補充「因為當時心理狀態都好不穩定嘅」，亦已超過4個月沒有接觸其電話，而他平日習慣會檢查電話以檢查遺忘的事情，因此他將 WhatsApp 的廣播名單（Broadcast）與群組「痴埋咗一嚿」。&lt;/p&gt;

These include strategic and tactical airlift; airborne tactical command and control (C2) and operational C2; air-to-air refueling; airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and electromagnetic warfare and suppression of enemy air defenses. These capabilities allow next-generation fighters like F-35s to operate effectively. At the moment, however, European air enabling capabilities are lacking. This brief outlines the need for air enablers and details the gaps in European capabilities before providing recommendations for how to fill those gaps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2002, just a few years removed from its operation in Kosovo, NATO convened its heads of state and government in Prague for an alliance summit. The Kosovo intervention had revealed shortcomings in the alliance’s “capacity to stage sustainable combat air operations,” at least without the United States bearing a disproportionate burden. NATO leaders were determined to address the matter. When they endorsed the summit declaration document, therefore, they noted among NATO’s military capability gaps a few areas that often receive less attention than big-ticket items like fighter aircraft, missile defense, or frigates: “intelligence, surveillance, and target acquisition; air-to-ground surveillance; command, control, and communications; strategic air and sea lift; [and] air-to-air refueling.” Allies committed to filling these gaps and promised to pursue this goal “vigorously.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine years later, in 2011, NATO was again called to conduct an air campaign, this time in Libya. But the promises of 2002 had not been fulfilled: again, it was revealed that European allies could not act without the United States providing key air enabling capabilities. After another 10 years, in August 2021, Europe’s limitations were exposed yet again, as European countries relied on the United States to evacuate their citizens from Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of appearances, however, Europe has made some progress over the past decade in closing this gap. Air enablers have become an area of tangible European defense cooperation, with NATO, the European Union, and their member states all working together. Nevertheless, European NATO allies and partners still do not possess sufficient air enabling capabilities for the security environment they face. Russia’s experience in Ukraine demonstrates that it is not only a country’s modern and sophisticated aerial capabilities that win fights, but the enablers that allow them to get to there, tell them where to go when they arrive, and minimize their exposure to enemy fire. Reports that, for example, Russia has held back from using its most sophisticated airborne systems because of their justifiable fear of Ukrainian air defense capabilities show that even with advanced fighter aircraft the inability to support those aircraft in the air can lead to mission failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief will describe the most critical enablers in the air domain, make the case for why they are needed, outline the gaps in European capabilities, and provide some recommendations for how to fill those gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-need-threat-perspective-and-strategic-analysis&quot;&gt;The Need: Threat Perspective and Strategic Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before discussing enabling capabilities in the air domain, it is critical to define terms and clarify what is considered an “enabling capability.” Unfortunately, there is no distinct definition or list of air enablers in NATO doctrine, nor is one readily available in the doctrines of member states. The definitions of enablers to air operations in adjacent writings have ranged from the mundane, like staff functions, to future technology such as artificial intelligence. For the purposes of this brief, the authors will define enablers as those combat capabilities that allow air forces to conduct air-to-air combat and strike missions, whether that be deep interdiction or supporting ground forces. Taking that into consideration, key enabling capabilities are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tactical Command and Control (C2): The direction and coordination of tactical forces to achieve operational objectives. In NATO and Western air forces, this is generally conducted by airborne C2 aircraft such as the E-3 AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) or ground-based deployable control facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operational C2: The planning and coordination of operations to achieve strategic objectives. For the NATO air component, this is conducted at Air Operations Centers (AOCs).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Airlift: The use of cargo aircraft to move personnel and supplies. This can either be strategic or tactical. The former involves the use of large airlifters to move material or personnel over a long range, usually from outside a theater of operations into the theater. The latter refers to transport that happens within a single theater of operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aerial Refueling: The use of tanker aircraft to refuel other aircraft in flight to extend their operational range.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR): The coordinated acquisition, processing, and dissemination of accurate, relevant, and timely information and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electromagnetic Warfare (EW): The use of the electromagnetic spectrum, both offensively and defensively, to deny the adversary the use of the spectrum and protect allied use of it. The most commonly thought of case is the jamming of radar or communications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD): The use of destructive or disruptive means to neutralize, destroy, or temporarily degrade adversary surface-to-air defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these enablers are of importance to a NATO air campaign. While a conflict with Russia is of primary concern to NATO given recent events in Ukraine, Russia’s failures in Ukraine also provide a valuable lesson on the importance of these enabling capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Russia began its invasion in February 2022, the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) held a significant numerical and technological advantage over the smaller Ukrainian Air Force. In planning and execution, however, the VKS made several critical mistakes in the use of its airpower, which contributed to Russian setbacks. Specifically, the VKS failed at SEAD and C2 in Ukraine, as well as at integrating intelligence. This has led to neither side gaining air superiority and has further exacerbated Russian ground force struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AYPb5rd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Russian S-400 Air Defense System.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that NATO should assume the VKS is a hollow force. In fact, much of its higher-end aircraft still remain active and its doctrine for confronting NATO is still viable. Russia has long believed that they are at a disadvantage in the air in relation to NATO and Western air forces. To counter this, they have invested heavily in advanced surface-based air defense (SBAD) systems to deny NATO aircraft the ability to fly in certain areas. While the poorly planned invasion of Ukraine did not follow Russian doctrine, should Russia learn from its mistakes and refocus on its doctrine, its military performance would likely be much improved. For instance, in a conflict with NATO in an area such as the Baltics where there is already overlapping areas of coverage as a result of the Russian Oblast of Kaliningrad, Russian SBAD capabilities would present a significant challenge to the operation of NATO air power capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter such a threat, NATO would need several enabling capabilities: ISR to quickly locate SBAD systems and other targets, EW and SEAD to degrade Russian SBAD capabilities, and tactical C2 to coordinate the effort. Furthermore, any large-scale operation also requires aerial refueling to provide aircraft with longer range and further coverage. Additionally, airlift may be required to enable the mobility of forces to complicate Russia’s offensive missile targeting. Unfortunately, some of these capabilities are either lacking in depth or concentrated in one country — the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a new problem. In the last large-scale NATO air campaign, Operation Unified Protector over Libya, several capabilities were also sorely lacking. During that operation, NATO was dependent on the United States for ISR, C2, and aerial refueling. This exposed limits in the alliance’s ability to conduct air operations without major assistance from the United States. Once operations turned over to NATO, the United States was meant to be a supporting force, providing only unique capabilities — and yet, it still flew over 50 percent of the sorties, providing 80 percent of ISR and aerial refueling, virtually all of the SEAD, and 25 percent of the airborne C2. In fact, in the early days of the campaign when the United States was attempting to be less involved, ISR was so lacking that a young U.S. officer working in the NATO AOC sent an impassioned and strongly worded email to their superiors bemoaning the state of affairs. This email quickly went viral in the halls of the Pentagon, and the United States soon allocated more support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A detailed RAND report from 2015 evaluating the air campaign in Libya recommended that NATO make a plan to address its reliance on U.S. enabling functions, such as ISR, Airborne C2, Aerial Refueling, and SEAD. There has been little positive movement in the years since; in fact, things have trended the opposite direction. For example, NATO is now wholly dependent on the United States for SEAD capabilities. These vignettes are just a few of the examples of enabling capability gaps that need to be addressed. The remainder of this report will examine these capabilities in depth and delineate where NATO countries need to invest for the future, particularly in situations where the forces of the United States might be heavily engaged elsewhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-state-of-existing-european-air-enabling-capabilities&quot;&gt;The State of Existing European Air Enabling Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, it will be instructive to give the lay of the land for native European air enabling capabilities as the situation stands today. This is a two-part endeavor: first, to tally significant capabilities in Europe, and second, to describe pertinent multinational efforts that share capabilities across nations. Some are NATO-led; others are comprised of separate groupings of countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2DY1RSd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;relevant-systems-in-europe&quot;&gt;Relevant Systems in Europe&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tactical Command and Control (C2): NATO owns and operates 14 E-3A AWACS as part of its Airborne Early Warning and Control Force (NAEW&amp;amp;C Force). The alliance’s commonly funded military budget provides funds for the force. This is the oldest version of the AWACS still in use, and NATO is actively studying replacing it with a newer system. Some countries fly other planes to fulfill similar roles, such as variants of the EMB-145 (Greece), the Gulfstream G550 CAEW (Italy), or the E-3F Sentry (France), among others. There is a total of 21 aircraft in this latter category.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operational C2: NATO has two Combined Air Operations Centers (AOCs), located in Uedem, Germany and Torrejón, Spain. This is in addition to the U.S. AOC at Ramstein AB in Germany; the UK Centre at High Wycombe; the NATO training AOC in Lyon, France; and the NATO deployable AOC stationed at Poggio Renatica, Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Airlift&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Strategic Lift: European allies and partners fulfill the requirement for strategic lift with a few different aircraft. To start, they own and operate 11 C-17 Globemasters; eight belong to the United Kingdom and three to a NATO-led consortium. Another consortium of European countries shares five AN-124-100 aircraft. All the rest are “multirole” aircraft: air tankers that are capable of strategic transport as well as aerial refueling. These constitute the vast majority of Europe’s strategic lift capability. For example, seven countries fly the A400M, owning between them a total of 107 aircraft. Additionally, NATO owns seven A330 MRTTs as part of its Multirole Tanker Transport Fleet; they are operated by a consortium of six allies. The United Kingdom flies ten more, and France five, for a total of 22 A330s.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tactical Lift: There are a number of relevant aircraft, including different variants of the C-130 Hercules, the Transall C-160, and the C-127 Spartan. All told, European countries operate roughly 125 such aircraft, with the vast majority being C-130 variants.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aerial Refueling: Relevant aircraft here include the A330 MRTT and A400M, as well as the A310 MRTT (a multirole aircraft for tactical lift), the KC-767, variants of the KC-130, and France’s specially modified C-135FR Stratotankers. Altogether, Europe has 156 such aircraft. The A330 MRTT and A400M aircraft have been counted twice, both in this category and under strategic lift. Without counting those multirole aircraft, there are only 27 dedicated refueling aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Tally of Select European Air Enablers.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: All data compiled by CSIS is from the IISS Military Balance 2023, unless indicated otherwise. Figures do not account for current operability of platforms. In the Comparable U.S. Total column, U.S. figures count those capabilities assigned to reserve forces and do not factor for current operability of platforms. Source: Author’s analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the remaining enablers, it is less instructive to look at precise quantity, as they rely less on big-ticket platforms and more on small assets — including uncrewed vehicles, missiles, and aircraft that can fulfill one of the below functions but have other primary missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR): Relevant capabilities run from drones like the MQ-9A Reaper, RQ-1B Predator, and Turkey’s many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to aircraft like the C-160, RC-235, or Beech 350. Of aircraft suited to ISR tasks, European countries currently own and operate only roughly three dozen. Of UAVs, the number is approximately 200.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electromagnetic Warfare (EW) and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD): European air forces conduct EW primarily via the use of radar jammers and anti-radiation missiles. These are used for SEAD tasks as well, so they will be considered together. European capabilities are severely lacking here. Only two countries field some variant of the AGM-88 High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM): Germany and Italy. Both plan to retire their Tornado aircraft that are capable of shooting the HARM as early as 2025. The United Kingdom retired its anti-radiation missile-capable Tornados in 2019. No countries yet field the extended range variant of this missile, the AARGM-ER, nor do they possess the GBU-53B StormBreaker or the MBDA SPEAR 3 missiles. Furthermore, no European countries appear to have any variation of another useful capability: the MALD-X air-launched decoy/jammer. Currently, Europe’s airborne EW capabilities focus on aircraft self-defense and they possess no offensive EW platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OTkqgOG.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Airbus A400M Multirole Aircraft.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;multinational-initiatives&quot;&gt;Multinational Initiatives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the systems above, quantity is lacking. In some cases, Europeans have attempted to address this by integrating, coordinating, or pooling and sharing assets. C2, strategic airlift, and aerial refueling are especially unusual in that collectively held assets are already quite common in these areas. NATO is the key player but not the only one. A few multinational initiatives are of note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is the NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control Force (NAEW&amp;amp;C Force), in which 19 allies participate. The 14 E-3A AWACS that comprise the force are unusual in that they are fully NATO-owned assets, as opposed to national aircraft made available for alliance operations. Their primary purpose is surveillance and battle management. According to NATO, the AWACS have significant capability: “three aircraft operating in overlapping, coordinated orbits can provide unbroken radar coverage of the whole of Central Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar NATO-owned fleet is the Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF), which flies the seven A330 MRTTs mentioned above. These aircraft can conduct both strategic transport and aerial refueling missions. Although NATO owns the aircraft, they were acquired via the Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR), acting on behalf of the NATO Support and Procurement. The European Defence Agency (EDA) led the overall initiative. All six participating NATO allies can access the MMF capabilities. The project demonstrates that European defense cooperation can help fill capability gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two similar initiatives are the Strategic Airlift Capability (SAC) and the Strategic Airlift International Solution (SALIS). Both are programs where capabilities are pooled and held collectively, as opposed to remaining national assets. The SAC consortium holds three C-17 Globemaster aircraft; it includes 10 NATO allies as well as Sweden and Finland. NATO’s Heavy Airlift Wing operates the aircraft and another NATO agency provides administrative support. Despite NATO’s role, however, participating countries can request the aircraft for national, EU, or even UN missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SALIS holds five AN-124-100 aircraft. Any consortium member can request access; the aircraft can be used for NATO missions, as well as EU or national ones. The consortium consists of nine NATO allies. It is coordinated, however, by a non-NATO entity: the Movement Coordination Centre Europe (MCCE), which comprises 28 member states from across the European Union and NATO. The center considers itself “brokers for strategic lift issues.” It cannot direct its members to provide assets, however; it can only rely on their voluntary willingness to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/s3uBv8y.png&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Movement Coordination Centre Europe Membership.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCCE resembles a smaller multinational body that coordinates air enablers: the European Air Transport Command (EATC). Its seven members not only coordinate their lift and aerial refueling assets — they pool them under a single joint command, which oversees joint operations. The fleet includes 150 assets spread across seven national air bases. A new Franco-German tactical air transport squadron will fly under the command of the EATC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dizzying array of initiatives gives the impression that airlift and refueling are robust areas of defense collaboration. In a sense, this is true. More than in most areas, European nations have been willing to make concessions on absolute sovereignty over military assets, whether by making a national aircraft available to a multinational pool or even by allowing pilots to fly operations under a joint command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, the proliferation of agencies, entities, and centers seems motivated by — and in part obscures — the apparent fact that Europe lacks the needed number of relevant systems. At a recent CSIS workshop, a participant compared the bureaucratic activity to “moving the deck chairs on the Titanic.” The participant also noted that members designed these initiatives to reduce European reliance on the United States for crisis-management missions like Operation Unified Protector — not for conventional war against Russia. This may explain their emphasis on strategic airlift, as opposed to tactical lift within theater. To the extent that they increase efficiency, these coordinating bodies likely have value. But this value should not be confused with what is probably more necessary: closing the critical capability gaps by investing in the necessary quantity of systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notable-forthcoming-capabilities&quot;&gt;Notable Forthcoming Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some reasons for optimism. In the realm of strategic lift and aerial refueling, the A400M is an example of improvement. The number of operational A400M aircraft in Europe increased from 97 in 2022 to 106 in 2023, with deliveries to France, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. And those seven countries are still waiting for more: there are 59 aircraft yet to be delivered, which will further bolster Europe’s strategic lift and aerial refueling capability (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZVYsvhZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: European Acquisitions of A400M Atlas Transport Aircraft.&lt;/strong&gt; *Recent reporting indicates that the United Kingdom is considering acquiring an additional six A400M aircraft, which would bring the total number of forthcoming planes to 65. See Tim Martin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://breakingdefense.com/2023/02/raf-defends-decision-behind-2-year-tactical-airlift-capability-gap-plans-additional-a400m-buy/&quot;&gt;“RAF defends decision behind 2-year tactical airlift capability gap, plans additional A400M buy,” Breaking Defense, February 2, 2023&lt;/a&gt;. Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://airbus.web.factory.eu.airbus.com/sites/g/files/jlcbta136/files/2023-02/2023-01_MRS_GEN_Ord-Deliv%20by%20country_0.pdf&quot;&gt;“Orders, Deliveries, In Operation Military Aircraft by Country - Worldwide,” Airbus, January 31, 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other aircraft will swell Europe’s ranks in the coming years. In addition to the forthcoming A400Ms, the MMF is expected to receive two more A330 MRTT planes by 2024. Between 2023 and 2025, Spain intends to add three to its own national fleet. France is also waiting on four. Regarding tactical lift, Portugal is reportedly acquiring five Embraer KC-390 medium transport aircraft, a variant of the C-390 Millennium that is also configured for aerial or on-ground refueling. The Netherlands has plans to replace its four C-130s with the same, and Hungary has also ordered two. Slovenia also intends to buy two C-27J aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These acquisitions seem to reflect a growing awareness among some smaller European militaries that a degree of native air enabling capability is desirable: Portugal, Hungary, and the Netherlands, for example, all currently lack any nationally held aerial refueling or multirole tanker/transport aircraft. On the other hand, some countries are moving in the opposite direction: Germany has retired its A310 MRTT fleet but reportedly is not replacing them with national capabilities, opting instead to rely on the NATO MRTT fleet for the needed enabling capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union is also seeking a role in the development of air enabling capabilities, albeit in a less concrete way. Via its Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) framework, it is assisting five member states to develop a future platform for strategic airlift by means of the Strategic Air Transport for Outsized Cargo (SATOC) program. It is not clear that the program will result in the actual delivery of new aircraft in a relevant timeframe. The bloc is pursuing a similar project for tactical lift via the Future Medium-Sized Tactical Cargo project (FMTC), but it is limited to defining requirements for what EU tactical airlift fleets might look like after 2035. Another project aspires to develop an EW jamming capability, and another to “potentially” adopt a joint EW concept of operations, which itself “might include . . . the establishment of a joint EW unit.” Another small project will fund research into a new hose and drogue system for existing tanker aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to airborne C2, a few developments are notable. For one, NATO is currently undertaking a modernization program for its E-3A AWACS, which it plans to retire and replace around 2035. At the moment, the program is in early stages: in 2022, the NSPA reportedly awarded three contracts to defense industry competitors to develop technical concepts for how to replace NATO’s aerial surveillance and C2 capability, based on proposals the companies had submitted in an earlier round. The United Kingdom will add to this capability when it replaces its retired fleet of E-3D Sentry aircraft with three modern E-7 AEW&amp;amp;C planes — the same aircraft that the United States intends to acquire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding aerial ISR, some European countries, such as the Netherlands and Poland, have plans to acquire MQ-9 Reaper UAVs. Finland has also conducted test flights with the drone. France also an ongoing program under its 2019–2025 Loi de Programmation Militaire to develop a light ISR aircraft. One of these modified Beechcraft 350 aircraft has already been delivered to the French Air Force; Paris intends to field a second by 2025, out of an eventual six.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another notable initiative is the “Eurodrone” project. A three-company consortium is developing the modern, twin-turboprop uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) for Spain, France, Italy, and Germany. OCCAR has acted as the contracting authority. The Eurodrone’s main mission will be ISTAR (intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance) — notably including armed ISTAR (i.e., ground support). The consortium will make 60 total UAVs. It projects the first flight for 2026 and delivery of the first aircraft for 2029. If successful, the project will add a needed ISR and combat capability to Europe’s repertoire, the former of which is a perennial low-density, high-demand area. Project leaders also hope it will represent a success story for European defense collaboration and the European defense industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2hwDHnB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image7&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;German chancellor Olaf Scholz (center) in front of Eurodrone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, with respect to EW and SEAD, the European defense company MBDA — a “joint venture” of Airbus, BAE Systems, and Leonardo — is currently developing the SPEAR-EW missile. According to MBDA, this variant of the SPEAR missile will provide jamming and decoy capability “across the threat spectrum” and will be able to be deployed on F-35 fighters as well as, reportedly, the future sixth-generation UK-Japan-Italy fighter. Other than the UK Royal Air Force, it is not clear which, if any, European countries will buy the missile. Italy’s recent announcement that it wishes to convert six Gulfstream aircraft into EC-37B Compass Call offensive EW aircraft is an extremely positive development. The United States should approve this sale in order to bolster European capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;capability-gaps&quot;&gt;Capability Gaps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these forthcoming capabilities, nearly every area mentioned here represents a capability gap. As Figure 1 shows, Europe lags well behind the United States in several areas. The differences in terms of airborne C2 (roughly 35 relevant European platforms compared to over 120 U.S. aircraft) and air-to-air refueling (about 150 to almost 450) are particularly stark. The disparity in aerial ISR assets is also notable: Europe has a few dozen relevant aircraft to 150 for the United States, and roughly 200 UAVs to over 900 for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to strategic airlift, AAR, and ISR, Europeans have been transparent about the shortfalls. In its Strategic Compass released in March 2022, for example, the European Union mentioned strategic airlift and ISR capabilities as critical gaps to “substantially reduce” by 2025. In November, the EU Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD) also identified strategic air transport as one of the “shortfalls corresponding to strategic enablers” that EU member states should address. France’s inability to conduct operations in the Sahel without U.S. air enablers likely motivated these inclusions. As recently as 2021, the United States also provided ISR, C2, and strategic and tactical lift for NATO’s Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding EW and SEAD, as the previous section notes, Europeans are currently reliant on the United States. According to a recent RUSI report, “no European NATO air forces currently have sufficient expertise or the required munitions stocks to conduct suppression and destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) at scale.” The lack of HARM missiles, especially the most modern version, is also problematic — particularly given the reports from Ukraine that they have been extremely effective. This too echoes the finding of a prior CSIS report, which found that the lack of long-range, high-speed radar-homing missiles for SEAD among Europeans could be a significant issue in a Russia fight, particularly as concerns the defense of the Baltic allies. It is therefore a serious gap in European capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-filling-gaps&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Filling Gaps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to European military capabilities, words are cheap. Consider again the 2002 Prague Summit Declaration, which, it will be remembered, flagged ISR, C2, airlift, and air-to-air refueling as “continuing capability shortfalls.” The same document said the following: “We will take the necessary steps to improve capabilities in the identified areas of continuing capability shortfalls . . . We are committed to pursuing vigorously capability improvements.” These promises were not realized by the time of Operation Unified Protector. Since then, some progress has been made on airlift and AAR but not enough — and, in the meantime, EW/SEAD has emerged as yet another capability gap in the area of air-based enablers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some of the raw numbers in earlier sections may imply Europe is in a decent state, should a major conflict with Russia break out, it will be woefully ill prepared. To start, Europe currently has little to no SEAD capabilities to speak of, a crucial enabler when faced with the Russian A2/AD network. Second, almost half of European tactical C2 aircraft are older and near the end of their lifetime. Furthermore, the relatively low number of these tactical C2 aircraft may not be robust enough to run the type of large continuous air campaign that would be required if Europe’s air forces were to go head-to-head with the VKS. Finally, NATO needs to adopt a concept similar to the U.S. Air Force’s (USAF) Agile Combat Employment (ACE) doctrine for use in the European theater, which would likely require in turn investments in tactical lift aircraft. In order to fill these gaps, European countries will need to decide whether these relatively unglamorous capabilities are worth the investment, think creatively, and look for opportunities for collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the final point, recent CSIS research that conceptualized European defense cooperation as a collective action problem outlines several principles that, if adopted, correlate with successful initiatives: (1) use the power of small groups, (2) normalize cooperation, and (3) incentivize cooperation to discourage fragmentation. As previously noted, air enablers have in the past decade been unusual in that these principles are already being followed in certain areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;if-it-aint-broke&quot;&gt;If It Ain’t Broke&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has a dedicated Air Mobility command for “strategic and tactical airlift, air-to-air refuelling and aeromedical evacuation.” It is tempting to say that Europe should copy the U.S. example and consolidate the bureaucratic entities discussed above into a single outfit — their functions centralized within, for example, the NATO chain of command, the MCCE, or the EATC. The presumption would be that this would streamline the process of making assets available when something goes wrong and they are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is not clear that this is currently a problem. There is not publicly available evidence that the MCCE, the EATC, or the various NATO and EU bodies have failed to execute on any mission or operation as a result of excessive administrative or bureaucratic entanglement or red tape. This seems to be a case where the principle of normalizing cooperation has in fact led to an effective system. The problem, therefore, seems to come back to the quantity of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prioritize-the-russia-fight&quot;&gt;Prioritize the Russia Fight&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When NATO adopted its new Strategic Concept at the Madrid Summit in June 2022, it de facto elevated collective defense above NATO’s other core tasks, calling it the alliance’s “key purpose.” The decisions taken at the Madrid Summit reinforced this prioritization, as have NATO’s actions since then. It follows that Europeans should emphasize, in doctrine and in budgets, air enabling capabilities that most enable a successful defense (and deterrent) against Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, a participant at a recent CSIS workshop identified airborne ISR and air mobility (airlift) as the two areas that European countries ought to prioritize. In the case of the former, the participant emphasized uncrewed systems, as those would be the assets the United States would most likely take out of the European theater in the event of an Indo-Pacific contingency. In the case of the latter, Europeans have made substantial investments in strategic airlift, as discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the case of a conventional fight with Russia, tactical lift may be the most needed. Some European countries seem to be going the opposite direction: the United Kingdom, for example, is retiring its 14 C-130J Hercules tactical lift aircraft in favor of the A400M. France has also invested heavily in the A400M. While the A400M is capable of tactical airlift, it is not specifically designed for this purpose, and there may be a tension if a simultaneous need arises for strategic airlift. In the last year, only Poland added new, operational planes to its fleet of tactical aircraft. The small number of forthcoming aircraft detailed in Section Four are not likely to be sufficient to enable NATO to ensure the large-scale mobility of materiel in and around Europe, should conflict erupt with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mobility could be essential and should replicate, as stated above, the USAF’s ACE doctrine. ACE is the proactive and reactive movement of forces around theater to complicate an adversary’s targeting solution and timeline and preserve friendly forces through the inherent defense of movement. While not specifically the U.S. ACE doctrine, the Ukrainian Air Force has been successful in complicating Russia’s targeting by dispersing their aircraft to alternate, non-traditional bases and remaining agile to avoid Russian missile attacks. Key to expanding this type of pursuit to the whole of Europe is the airlift capacity to move supplies and support personnel around the continent — in other words, pilots must be able to land on any European airbase and be sure that the base will have what is needed to service their aircraft. This is where modern tactical airlift capacity becomes critical. It follows that European NATO allies, perhaps deploying the principle of small groups via joint procurement, should prioritize investments here. The European Union could play a key role in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to EW and SEAD, European countries ought to invest to counter Russia’s vast Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) capabilities. Specifically, European nations should consider a SEAD missile compatible with their F-35 fleets such as the AARGM-ER or the future SPEAR-EW. Additionally, nations should consider investing in EW capabilities that are compatible with the future U.S. Electromagnetic Battle Management (EMBM) and Cognitive EW systems. This will ensure NATO allies are able to jointly coordinate the fight in the electromagnetic spectrum across the EMBM network and respond to unexpected threats in near-real time via Cognitive EW techniques. This will require aircraft purchases and upgrades that include software open system architecture and software-defined radios in order to link in with the future systems via software updates, as opposed to more expensive hardware buys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;seek-opportunities-for-specialization&quot;&gt;Seek Opportunities for Specialization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, it makes sense for European militaries to opt for proportionately large investments in certain capabilities and abstain from investing in others. For example, some experts have noted that SEAD is an area where European air forces would need to specialize in order to do it effectively. Since the F-35 is an EW-capable aircraft that will soon be able to use the newest AARGM-ER (extended-range) HARM and the SPEAR EW, it may be wise for one European air force that flies it — or a small group, in accordance with the second collective action principle — to assume primary responsibility for European EW capabilities. The logic here is that EW/SEAD is a highly complex task that requires a significant amount of training and exercising, not to mention investment in the anti-radiation missiles and other technologies needed to do it effectively. Italy or Germany, as they already have some experience with the mission, would be viable candidates to take on this role, even if they make must budgetary sacrifices elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;european-union-use-the-principle-of-incentivizing-cooperation&quot;&gt;European Union: Use the Principle of Incentivizing Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union is increasingly finding itself as an actor in security and defense. But its projects are often limited in ambition and financing. Nonetheless, it has tools it can bring to bear, including the EDA’s expertise on harmonizing requirements, financial capacity to incentivize joint procurement, and — if member states were to raise their level of ambition — even possibly the ability to pool or borrow large amounts of money to directly procure military hardware as a bloc. In any case, politics and practicality dictate that any new methods — or significant expansions of existing methods — would need a project to act as proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of argument, one potential project emerges from the analysis above. Tactical airlift is a critical enabling capability in a collective defense contingency vis-à-vis Russia, whether or not NATO adopts a version of the USAF’s ACE doctrine. Furthermore, as mentioned above, there is already a pertinent EU PESCO project, FMTC. Intra-Europe military mobility is an EU defense priority, as well as a priority area for EU-NATO cooperation. Finally, the three tactical aircraft that Europe flies — the C-130, C-295, and C-27J — are reportedly “approaching the end of their lifecycle in the upcoming decade.” It is logical therefore that this is an area where the European Union should focus its efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forthcoming European Defense Investment Program (EDIP) will build on an existing program and should combine funding with incentives like tax waivers to encourage joint procurement. It could adopt the FMTC project — which has only just been launched and is limited in scope — as a flagship program, which will enable in turn a potential replication of the ACE concept at the NATO level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;united-states&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can assist its European allies by considering four key suggestions. First, it can encourage cooperative developments in European defense — as well as consider joint and interoperable transatlantic procurement with European allies — specifically in the area of software open system architecture. Second, there is a need to be open with European allies about U.S. capabilities that cannot be reliably assumed to remain in the European theater, especially in the event of a contingency in the Indo-Pacific. Third, the U.S. Department of Defense should spread the U.S. “distributed and collaborative” concept of Cognitive EW to European allies and partners and include European partners in the development of that system, as well as the EMBM system. This also goes for the Agile Combat Employment doctrine. Finally, there are strong arguments in favor of the United States considering ways to increase classified information-sharing with allies and close partners, particularly those using similar U.S.-made equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the United States and NATO should learn from Russia’s failures in Ukraine and their own shortcomings in Libya. Critical air enabling capabilities may not garner media attention, but they are needed to win the fights for which the United States and its European allies and partners are preparing. The Euro-Atlantic community did not fill this gap between 1999 and 2011, nor between 2011 and 2023. How wide will the gap be in another 12 years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（14日）踏入審訊第43天。趙家賢今接受代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大狀沈士文盤問，同意因民主派光譜不同，要協調他們當選後行為幾乎不可能，而較新晉、無政黨的抗爭派亦令選舉協調困難增加。趙又同意，民主黨「絕對支持」中國回復對香港主權，稱黨歌歌詞有「香江終於歸中國，兩制相輔開新天」。他亦同意，林卓廷和黃碧雲絕對是民主黨政策的堅定支持者，時任黨主席胡志偉亦同樣，指他作為倡導政策的主席沒理由不支持。惟法官陳慶偉笑言不能確定，指「我們見識過政治」，舉例蘇聯共產黨的戈爾巴喬夫也不支持其黨政策，有被告大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意民主派光譜不一-民主動力要協調當選後行為幾乎不可能&quot;&gt;趙同意民主派光譜不一 民主動力要協調當選後行為幾乎不可能&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢今接受代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文盤問。趙家賢確認，於2012年開始參與民主動力工作，2014年成為召集人，民主動力工作為協調民主派參選，以免票源相撞，而協調時需聚集本土抗爭派和傳統民主派，但因兩者的價值觀等本質不同，故要協調出選名單本身已非常困難。趙亦同意，民主動力工作從不是要協調當選者進入議會後要做什麼，而且因兩派光譜不同，故要協調他們當選後做什麼亦是幾乎不可能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱民主黨支持中國對港主權及一國兩制否決財案與否需經中委會討論&quot;&gt;趙稱民主黨支持中國對港主權及「一國兩制」、否決財案與否需經中委會討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，民主黨和社民連同屬傳統民主派，而傳統民主派的特質包括他們有政治聯繫，在參與本港選舉有很長的歷史；而本土抗爭派則大部分不屬任何攻黨，選舉對他們而言較新。沈士文續問，民主黨是否支持中國回復對香港的主權？趙指「呢個絕對支持，我哋黨歌都有『香江終於歸中國，兩制相輔開新天』」，林卓廷和黃碧雲相視而笑。趙亦同意，民主黨支持《基本法》和一國兩制，亦會在支持者接受下盡可能與政府合作，該做法至少自2012至2020年也維持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/elKjekk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黃碧雲&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢曾供稱，民主黨代表莊榮輝曾在新東會議上，表示不獲授權代表民主黨進行表決，趙指莊的行為與他對民主黨的了解一致。趙同意，議員當選後會怎樣做對黨是很重要的事，需經中委會討論，亦需考慮支持者的意見，並指民主黨有立法會黨團，議員會就重要議題商討，盡量確保立場一致。趙同意，因為民主黨上述立場，他作為民動召集人要協調民主黨黨員當選後的行為是幾乎不可能，亦非民動職責，強調民動多年來只是獲傳統民主派授權進行選舉協調。沈續指，趙的協調工作變得更困難，因為本土抗爭派較新晉，且沒有政治聯繫，可以自行做決定？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱林卓廷黃碧雲和胡志偉堅定支持民主黨政策-官提戈爾巴喬夫指黨主席或有不同議程&quot;&gt;趙稱林卓廷、黃碧雲和胡志偉堅定支持民主黨政策 官提戈爾巴喬夫指黨主席或有不同議程&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，於2004年加入民主黨，曾於2010年至2014年任兩屆中委會委員，知道黃碧雲是創黨成員，亦知道林卓廷很早加入，辯方稱是於1999年。沈士文問，他是否認為黃碧雲和林卓廷是「典型傳統民主派」？法官李運騰一度問是什麼時間點，笑言80年代和90年代的民主派可能不同，陳慶偉亦問何為「典型傳統民主派」。沈士文和陳慶偉其後改問，直至趙加入民主黨後，是否認為黃碧雲和林卓廷是民主黨政策的堅定支持者（firm supporters）？趙答「絕對係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問那胡志偉呢？此時陳慶偉哈哈大笑。趙表示：「回應法官閣下，佢係黨主席當時。」陳仲衡再問，那他會否視胡志偉為民主黨政策的堅定支持者？趙再指：「回應法官閣下，佢係黨主席，佢係有份倡導決定政策嘅，咁冇理由唔會支持呢個政策嘅。」惟陳慶偉指，「你不能如此咬定，你看，我們見識過政治（we have seen politics），蘇聯共產黨的戈爾巴喬夫也不支持他政黨的政策，所以作為黨主席可能會有不同的議程（agenda）」，林卓廷大笑，又與黃碧雲對視而笑。陳終笑指，所以趙不能說因為胡志偉是主席就必然會有此看法，但那也是趙的答案。沈士文則指稍後會談到九東，續就另一議題發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nVRyKHz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（14日）踏入審訊第43天。趙家賢繼續接受盤問，確認辦初選的初心僅為民主派集中選票，而非否決預算案，感覺被戴耀廷和部分本土派「騎劫」，但承認當時沒有表達。惟法官庭上引述多份民主動力文件，質疑從沒提及被騎劫，其中有署名「趙家賢」的感謝信稱初選「創出民主運動的壯舉」，法官陳仲衡直言趙「不像是火車或客機被騎劫的受害者，除非你患上斯德哥爾摩症候群」，惟趙稱文件非由他所撰；法官陳慶偉亦指趙一直指責戴為「大文豪」、「大思想家」，卻於記者會感謝戴耀廷，趙解釋是「互送高帽」，「壓抑」對戴耀廷的真實感受，多人大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，法官李運騰關注趙答應承辦初選前，是否已留意到初選出現「反政府」和「反建制」的傾向、且越來越強，趙同意，指「當時整個社會嘅氣氛都係咁」；而他仍答應承辦初選，是望民主動力有崗位協助民主運動，不想被邊緣化或「衰喺我手上」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙2021年6月首次錄口供稱感被戴耀廷騎劫利用有責任協助當局&quot;&gt;趙2021年6月首次錄口供稱感被戴耀廷騎劫利用、有責任協助當局&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢繼續接受代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文盤問。沈展示趙於2021年6月29日進行的首次警誡錄影會面謄本，趙表示辦初選的初心純粹是提供「初選服務」，讓市民投選心儀候選人，及進行民意調查讓候選人獲支持繼續選舉工程，「咁但係成件事情好明顯就係，即係我個人同埋民主動力都係被利用，同埋係被騎劫咗嘅」。他續指，其初心只是望增大民主陣營，集中票源取得更多議席，但整個過程卻一步步變成要影響政府穩妥運作，「咁所以即係我會覺得係有責任，係協助當局呢，係要將成件事去理解清楚，而我都好係自願地，係好願意去配合，去講出真實事實嘅情況出嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意上述是他當時的看法，即有被騎劫和利用的印象，強調「我當時係咁諗」。法官李運騰追問趙其後的想法是否有變？趙回答：「當時我係會覺得完全係好無辜」，但亦認為就「一啲盡責審查、謹慎責任，其實我作為召集人如果做得更加好嘅話，應該係避免咗成個民主動力仝人係會牽涉喺件事當中」。李續問，趙至現在是否仍然有被騎劫的感覺？趙稱「有嘅」，但再強調：「不過我自己要檢討返我各方面嘅責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢指初心不包括戴耀廷-稱被戴及部分本土派騎劫&quot;&gt;趙家賢指「初心」不包括戴耀廷 稱被戴及部分本土派「騎劫」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢於2021年7月21日進行第二次錄影會面，當時他主動補充首次會面的內容，表示作為溫和民主派想做「政界調解員角色」，而他和民主動力獲委託承辦初選時，「我哋個初心係好清楚」，就是希望提供一個平台予市民投票表達意見，揀選他們心目中最適切的民主派民主陣營代表，集中選票選出代表進入立法會，及希望立法會內有多些民主派人士。趙確認上述說的4點就是全部的「初心」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，趙提及「我哋個初心係好清楚」，他使用「我哋」是否不單代表他本人，亦包括民主動力、戴耀廷及區諾軒？趙表示包括他本人、民主動力相關人士及區諾軒。李追問即不包括戴耀廷？趙堅定說：「絕對冇。」李再問，即基本上趙是指他被戴耀廷騎劫？趙同意並補充：「同埋部份嘅本土抗爭派。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱感戴耀廷想踢開民動唔接好過接-惟鍾錦麟稱區諾軒會拉得住戴遂答應&quot;&gt;趙稱感戴耀廷想「踢開」民動、「唔接好過接」 惟鍾錦麟稱區諾軒「會拉得住戴」遂答應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續指，趙的證供很清楚，就是嘗試在他和區諾軒與戴耀廷之間「劃界」，並再問當趙答應承辦初選時，他的初心是包括戴在內嗎？趙思考數秒後，陳決定先小休予趙思考。趙其後回答問題，先談及民主動力同意承辦初選的經過，指起初戴耀廷其實認為可以不用找民主動力，而是直接找香港民意研究所做眾籌和初選，但民研不同意，並指曾與民動合作，提議戴找民動簽約，故戴才找趙和民動承辦初選。趙續指，戴詢問他時他「思考緊」，「當時我嘅睇法就係本身都係想踢開民主動力啦，突然間又搵返，第一下個諗法，總係覺得，唔接好過接嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟趙指，因他們正思考時，戴耀廷已向協調會議與會者稱邀請了民主動力，令他和民動「有一個壓力喺度」。而趙其後諮詢副召集人鍾錦麟，鍾認為「有區諾軒喺度呢，係會拉得住戴耀廷」，因區任民陣召集人時與不同派別光譜有良好關係，趙亦知區諾軒就初選的初心；而他們亦知道若沒有初選，民主派便會「搶票搶得好犀利」，故趙作為召集人「最後決定」承辦初選。趙指，因此錄影會面談及「我哋嘅初心」時，是包括「我、民主動力嘅相關人士同埋區諾軒」，並同意他是被區諾軒邀請參與「35+計劃」，從區得知計劃的初心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指否決預算案非35初心-知戴提攬炒-惟無表達己見&quot;&gt;趙指否決預算案非「35+」初心 知戴提「攬炒」 惟無表達己見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續引趙早前稱，若他一早得知戴耀廷的「攬炒」主張，就不會答應承辦初選？趙答：「冇錯，絕對不會」，並同意戴「攬炒十步」首兩步預期民主派會被DQ、由 Plan B 繼續參選，並在立法會取得35+議席，均是「35+計劃」的初心；至於第四步後提及否決政府撥款和預算案是否計劃的初心，趙則指「完全冇咁樣嘅思考」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，趙家賢或沒有這樣想，但趙亦曾提及協調會議上曾討論「會運用」或「會積極運用」否決權，公民黨亦於3月記者會已談及否決預算案。趙同意當時已對此有認知，重申當時有「拉扯」，溫和及本土派就該倡議「好似大家鬥講言論」以爭取支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文再引錄影會面謄本，趙提及列席協調會時，聽過戴耀廷提及要積極運用基本法權力否決預算案及如何「攬炒」政權。沈問因此趙當時意識到戴的說法？趙同意，稱是「好標題式咁樣」。沈續引趙提及，會上有本土抗爭派同意附和戴的說法，「咁我嗰陣時都有認知個情況，咁但係就礙於當時，即係作為一個只係叫做列席會議嘅人士，就冇特別去表達意見。但係我心裏面就好清楚係，就係絕對不認同有關嘅建議同做法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官關注趙知初選反建制趨勢仍答應辦初選-趙認不想組織邊緣化衰喺我手上&quot;&gt;官關注趙知初選「反建制」趨勢仍答應辦初選 趙認不想組織邊緣化、「衰喺我手上」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意有上述想法時，他還未答應承辦初選。沈士文問，趙雖不同意戴的看法，但沒有向他表達，是否因他理解否決預算案並非計劃的初心？趙同意，重申否決財案「絕對唔係關於初選嘅事情」。李運騰續問，有趣的是趙於3月開始出席不同協調會議，亦獲助手匯報會議情況，他有否留意到人們對否決預算案有更強烈的意見和討論？趙指有留意到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續問，那趙會否認為有危險的傾向？趙稱當時不認為危險，因戴耀廷有解釋這是《基本法》制定的流程和憲制權利。李運騰指他不是指違法的危險，而是運動開始出現「反政府（anti-government）」和「反建制（anti-establishment）」的傾向，且越來越強烈，趙同意，指「當時整個社會嘅氣氛都係咁」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，即使趙意識到此，仍於5月正式答應承辦初選？趙重申「當時社會氣氛個背景係咁樣」，而他認為民主動力作為民主派一分子，希望可以繼續有角色和崗位協助民主運動，「我唔想自己承繼咗個組織嘅營運，然後個組織叫做係被邊緣化或者衰喺我手上」。李運騰問，他是否想繼續在鎂光燈之下（under the spotlight），即想他的組織是整個計劃的一分子？趙答「有相關、有參與」，其後並同意辯方指，在意識到民主派就否決預算案有拉扯下，仍繼續承辦初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文其後續引趙錄影會面，趙重申承辦初選後發覺有本土抗爭派逐步逐步「騎劫初選」，將「攬炒」等倡議慢慢帶出和討論，覺得「越嚟越係有問題」，但礙於初選已進行，認為使命上「應該都要完成好我哋呢個初心」。惟趙指越來越發覺初選被「扭曲」，終決定退出初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;民主動力眾籌頁提光復香港-趙稱由兼職同事所撰出咗事&quot;&gt;民主動力眾籌頁提「光復香港」 趙稱由兼職同事所撰、「出咗事」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢庭上屢提及被「騎劫」，惟法官陳仲衡今主動要求展示4份文件質疑。陳先要求展示民主動力發起的「35+計劃」眾籌頁面，當中「公民投票背景」提及「暴政又於今年加推國歌法、國安法，對港人的輾壓施暴變本加厲…身為命運共同體，不止遊行、集會、聲援被捕手足，堅持五大訴求…亦要於議會、國際、日常生活的文宣等不同戰線繼續努力，才可擺脫極權魔爪…要光復香港的其中一步，就是團結一致，繼續內外抗爭…合計過半，才可光復立法會，奪回控制權，壓制港共政權，再繼而改革政制，建立民主政府。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認知道有關頁面，但主動補充指，因自己不熟悉眾籌平台的操作，所以全部交由民主動力總幹事黎敬輝處理。他續指黎曾將版面給予他看，但他當時只集中在版面應放置甚麼相片，內容上則完全信靠黎，但他強調：「呢度我都係要承擔責任，冇做好謹慎責任睇清楚當中一啲字眼」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續問，根據該文件，趙是否仍然認為他及民主動力被騎劫？趙表示他之後得知眾籌版面所刊出的字眼，「喺我角度會用『出咗事』嚟形容」，並指當時他叫黎報告，「佢都係搵咗一啲兼職嘅同事幫手草擬」。陳追問：「所以你是被兼職同事騎劫？（“So you were hijacked by some part-time staff?”）」，旁聽席和被告席均傳來笑聲，趙回應：「我又唔可以話騎劫，所以我頭先講話要負謹慎責任」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱民動就35好多事情最後先知和排除在外-包括投票系統&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱民動就「35+」好多事情「最後先知」和「排除在外」 包括投票系統&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡其後要求展示民主動力2020年10月的會議記錄，提及趙家賢匯報因民主動力及戴耀廷受到國務院及港澳辦嚴厲譴責，民主動力為免繼續被打壓而退出協調工作。陳質疑趙當時並無提及他本人或民主動力被騎劫，趙同意在文字記錄中沒有這個意思，但強調曾與執委會成員講述被騎劫一事。他續指，當日會上主要討論民主動力與香港民意研究所合作的關係，而紀錄是由黎敬輝及另一職員負責，他們重點記錄此內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續主動解釋，民主動力曾與香港民意研究所簽約，但「事實上好多事情民主動力都係最後先知同埋排除在外」。他舉例，民主動力2017及2018年負責新東及九西補選初選，當年仍在香港大學轄下的香港民意計劃，就投票系統的介面操作等，「係好清楚一步步比我哋睇咗、同意咗先繼續去做嘅」，亦會即時向他匯報每小時投票數字；但在「35+計劃」中，投票系統已研發好、義工亦正進行訓練，民主動力「根本最後先至知道」系統操作，就投票數字亦「追得好辛苦，或者根本全部畀咗戴耀廷知，戴耀廷公布咗之後民主動力先知」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙於感謝函指投票日創出民主運動壯舉官質疑不像被騎劫-除非患斯德哥爾摩症候群&quot;&gt;趙於感謝函指投票日「創出民主運動壯舉」官質疑不像被騎劫 除非患「斯德哥爾摩症候群」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡其後再要求展示一封2020年10月，下款為「民主動力召集人 趙家賢博士」的感謝函，題目提及「感謝推動『2020立法會選民登記行動』及民主派 35+ 公民投票」，上款為致「十八區區議會民主派議員」。陳仲衡問這份信函是否並非由兼職同事撰寫？被告和旁聽人士均發笑，趙回應是總幹事黎敬輝草擬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續指，信函提及趙對「35+計劃」的感受，形容初選投票是「創出民主運動的壯舉」，又指如此看來，「你不像是火車或客機被劫持的受害者，除非你患上斯德哥爾摩症候群（“It doesn’t sound like you were a victim of a hijacked train, or a hijacked plane, unless you suffer from Stockholm syndrome.”）」，這時林卓廷大笑、余慧明亦掩嘴笑，在延伸庭的眾被告亦大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙解釋，信函目的是感謝協助選民登記及初選票站的民主派議員，並邀他們參與「民主派地區發展協調機制」改革小組；而他看畢黎敬輝的草擬本後認為有字眼需要更改，因此未有簽署和發出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙表示信函由助手撰寫-提及光復議會對抗極權指他不及自己保守&quot;&gt;趙表示信函由助手撰寫 提及「光復議會」、「對抗極權」指他不及自己保守&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡亦引信函提及「一同推動『團結一致，立會過半，光復議會』」。趙回應時提及早前民動帖文出現「光復議會」，他亦曾向法官致歉指沒有做好謹慎責任，並指就此信函會刪除「光復議會」及「創出民主運動的壯舉」字句。趙同意陳仲衡所指，當時已經是10月30日，他在遣詞用字上會較小心，但指因要處理其他工作，故最後沒有跟進信件修改事宜，亦沒有將感謝函發出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後問趙有沒有其他想更改的字眼，趙指會刪除「立法會選舉雖被政權無理延遲一年，國安法已臨」、「對抗極權，支援運動」以及「團結民主力量，對抗專制極權」。法官李運騰問，撰寫信函的黎敬輝是否支持本土抗爭派的立場？趙稱在民主派光譜中，「佢睇得比我冇咁保守」。被問草擬本是否由黎自行撰寫，趙指他指示黎草擬，「佢自己草擬定係搵咗兼職草擬再比我，我就唔知道啦」，他亦不清楚黎現時身在何處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑民動工作報告無提被騎劫並感謝戴耀廷-趙稱互送高帽壓抑真實感受&quot;&gt;官質疑民動工作報告無提被騎劫並感謝戴耀廷 趙稱「互送高帽」、壓抑真實感受&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡最後要求展示民主動力2018年11月至2020年12月的工作報告，提及2020年7月12日初選投票結束，戴耀廷、區諾軒和趙家賢於香港民意研究所外舉行記者會，「召集人趙家賢博士感謝超過60萬香港市民面對當權者有形無形的打壓，仍無懼走出來表達意見。同時，非常感謝民主動力秘書處團隊、兩位初選協調人、香港民意研究所、各區議員、黃店、站務人員及義工共同努力，排除萬難，成就香港民主歷史一頁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡指，這份報告非如感謝函般未經發布，而當中提及初選「成就香港民主歷史一頁」，問趙是否同意？趙指當時其助手應將他在記者會的發言綜合在報告。沈士文再問，「35+」是否香港民主歷史一頁？趙指民間投票有逾50萬人投票，是香港民主歷史的一頁，但亦指他當日仍未看到戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步〉一文。惟李運騰指，至報告撰寫的2020年12月，趙已曾讀過戴的文章，並問「報告哪裡提到被騎劫？你的組織被騎劫，這不是重要的事嗎？而你沒有向執委會報告？」，鄒家成和林卓廷微笑。趙指，工作報告是按時間撰寫，職員只是按當時紀錄整理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，故趙的助手沒有感覺他被騎劫？趙否認，解釋工作報告大部分都是態度正面。陳慶偉續問，第一段提及「非常感謝…兩位初選協調人」，並笑着說，「你一直指責戴耀廷作為『大文豪』、『大思想家』，而你又多謝他（“All along you condemned benny tai as a great writer, as great philosopher, and you thanked him.”）」，林卓廷、鄒家成和吳政亨發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續回應：「喺當時嘅情況下，大家有咁多人出嚟投票，整個社會氣氛係雄心壯志嘅」，陳慶偉指他不關注市民，而是問戴耀廷。趙續重申，當晚見到有很多人投票，「各個記者都問啲好正向嘅訊息，咁與會嘅發言者都會向大家互送高帽」，林卓廷和鄒家成再發笑。李運騰問，故因此避免冒犯投票者，趙家賢就隱瞞（conceal）了他對戴的真實感受？趙答：「唔係隱瞞，係壓抑」，被告和旁聽席即傳來大笑聲，在延伸庭的黃之鋒亦笑到抬起頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙其後同意，戴耀廷有關攬炒的文章「絕對唔係」以「35+」的名義發布，而民主動力發布的初選廣告，亦只是籲選民投票，同意不理否決財案，初選有逾50萬人投票本身已是「公民社會嘅歷史一頁」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（14日）踏入審訊第43天。趙家賢續接受盤問，同意運用否決權與否非戴耀廷一人能決定，需所有人同意。法官關注會上如何處理各方分歧，趙指新東和新西曾在戴要求下進行「意向性投票」。法官追問意思，李運騰一度指即少數服從多數，「這就是民主，對嗎？」；陳慶偉則問趙若是戴會怎樣做，趙答「我好難代入我係戴耀廷，精神同心理上都好難」，惹來哄堂大笑，趙並指戴是想獲得起草協議的大方向。趙又重申，對民主黨代表未獲授權，但新東通過「會運用」否決權感詫異，沒有出席該次會議的他在法官追問下，指當時民主黨代表「應該係」沒有投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認各區協調會議達成4項共識&quot;&gt;趙確認各區協調會議達成4項共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大狀沈士文繼續盤問。趙家賢確認在初選投票日前，參選人唯一需要簽署的只是提名表格，而協調會議上，所有參選人需就4點達成共識，包括進行公民投票、替補機制、出選議席數目、舉辦初選論壇，若不同意就不能參與初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，有選區會在初選後才商討出選名單，指以其記憶包括九東、港島區及超級區議會，惟提及九東時於該區出選的施德來搖頭。趙亦同意，5個地方選區及超級區議會，均對上述4點達成共識，他沒有收到任何參與者有異議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意用否決權與否非戴耀廷個人可決定-指新東新西曾進行意向性投票&quot;&gt;趙同意用否決權與否非戴耀廷個人可決定 指新東新西曾進行「意向性投票」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續問及，參選人當選後是否運用權力否決財政預算案，是一項非常重要的議題，並不能只由戴耀廷決定？趙同意該承諾需由所有參與者同意，但強調戴在會上有提及否決預算案的觀點。法官李運騰續問，若會議上各人對運用否決權有不同意見，該如何解決，是投票決定、少數服從多數，還是需達成一致共識？趙表示他及民主動力並非協調的角色，但根據其助手黎敬輝所指，新西及新東最後在戴的要求下進行「意向性投票」。李追問，這即是少數服從多數，「這就是民主，對嗎？」林卓廷一度說「嘩」，趙未有回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官要求解釋意向性投票趙我好難代入戴耀廷精神同心理上都好難&quot;&gt;官要求解釋「意向性投票」趙：我好難代入戴耀廷，精神同心理上都好難&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後問甚麼是「意向性投票」，並舉例在新東會議，可能社民連對否決權有保留，但鄒家成說一定要運用否決權，那戴耀廷如何解決？陳又模擬主持會議，稱誰同意一定要運用否決權就舉手，這時在延伸庭的岑敖暉舉起手，陳又模擬誰反對、中立或不獲授權的也舉手，問是否就是「意向性投票」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙回應，初選要制訂大家都有一致共識的條款，但若協調時作正式投票，就未能處理對議題不贊成或有保留人士的關注，故「意向性投票」可指「非正式投票」，並指戴曾提及想獲得與會者大方向以起草協議。陳慶偉再問，假若趙是戴耀廷，會如何處理議會上不同意見？趙重申若工作上要擬訂協議，「都要有個多數人同意嘅版本出嚟再畀各個個人或組織去研究。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉認為說法抽象，再問若趙是戴耀廷會怎樣做（“What would you do if you are Benny Tai?”），會如何處理會上分歧？趙回答：「法官閣下，首先我好難代入我係戴耀廷，我精神同心理上都好難」，惹來哄堂大笑，趙並指：「但係如果我係以一個有調解員背景嘅協調人⋯」惟遭陳慶偉打斷，並指趙其實對會上投票情況不知情，趙指「因為唔係我倡議要做嗰個投票嘅」，並同意自己只是被告知曾進行投票，亦無再仔細追問之後有否其他溝通程序，導致最終投票結果出現在協議文件中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱民主黨代表未獲授權-當時應該係沒有投票&quot;&gt;趙稱民主黨代表未獲授權 當時「應該係」沒有投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續引述趙早前的證供，趙稱對新東第二次會議投票通過「會運用」感「好詫異」，因認為民主黨代表無獲授權投票。他曾問有出席會議的黎敬輝，黎解釋戴耀廷曾指「份協議係要出最後版本㗎啦，要出到個大方向出嚟」，故進行意向性投票，結果「會運用」字眼屬大比數「so-called 通過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，故趙理解即使民主黨代表不獲授權，但當時仍投票通過了協議？陳慶偉亦問，即會上沒有獲授權的民主黨代表，是否被要求「你行埋一邊，讓其他人投票」，邊說邊揮手比劃。沒出席該次會議的趙指「呢個應該係當時嘅情況」，被告席傳來「吓」，鄒家成發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續同意，當時曾向戴耀廷了解，得知投票情況確實如黎所說，而趙向戴反映民主黨情況，戴回應只想有大方向起草協議，之後會與民主黨處理。沈士文一度問，故這樣反映戴耀廷也認為參與者要有一致的決定？惟法官質疑這不是唯一可能，趙亦不能猜測，沈終沒有繼續發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一（17日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is central to this complexity. Not only does space underpin all instruments of our national power, but access to and freedom to maneuver in the domain are foundational to the United States’ status as a great power. This sixth edition of the Space Threat Assessment describes a domain undergoing a significant and rapid transformation. The number of objects in space continues to soar, the value of the global space economy is at an all-time high, and, unfortunately, the threat to the domain is real and concerning today. Over the past year and a half, there has been regular testing and use of reversible non-destructive capabilities as well as a destructive test that created a debris field, jeopardizing safe operations and indicating that the domain will continue to become more contested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two significant threats face the United States with this rapid change in the domain. First, China and Russia are developing and integrating space capabilities that will afford them the same advantages the United States currently enjoy, placing U.S. forces at great risk. Second, they are developing a robust spectrum of offensive capabilities to deny the United States and its partners, including commercial space companies, access to the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This edition of the Space Threat Assessment includes a dedicated section on the Russia-Ukraine war. Commercial space capabilities are making a significant contribution to the fight and have provided Ukraine access to space that they do not have organically. Commercial space has served as a great equalizer, allowing Ukrainian forces to have the necessary intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and command and control to better understand Russian force disposition, communicate and stay connected globally, and strike with precision. Therefore, it is not surprising that Russia has tried to deny access to these commercial capabilities largely through jamming and cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As some have suggested, the Russia-Ukraine war is “the first commercial space war,” and it has highlighted areas where the use of commercial space capabilities has advanced ahead of policy, strategy, and concepts of operations. This assessment is important to having a better understanding of the threats faced in, to, and from the domain and should be a valuable source of information to inform policymakers to be better prepared for future conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are significant challenges, the space domain offers even more opportunities. The United States remains the world leader in space. U.S. allies, partners, and the commercial space sector provide great advantage. With strengthened leadership in the domain, the United States must continue to define safe and professional behavior in space to its advantage, seek increased transparency, strengthen our partnerships, and develop capabilities necessary to deter conflict — and if deterrence were to fail, to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the sixth edition of Space Threat Assessment by the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). This resource for policymakers and the public leverages open-source information to assess key developments in foreign counterspace weapons. Drawing on six years of collected data and analyses, this series describes trends in the development, testing, and use of counterspace weapons and enables readers to develop a deeper understanding of threats to U.S. national security interests in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past year was dominated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where space capabilities, including commercial satellites, played a highly visible and compelling role in Ukraine’s resistance to the invasion. Communications and imagery satellites have been used to connect Ukrainian troops across the battlefield, track Russian military movements, and map humanitarian corridors. As space capabilities continue to demonstrate their utility, from peacetime to conflict, it should come as no surprise that adversaries seek to block their use. Thus, this year’s featured analysis provides an in-depth look at Russia’s battlefield employment of counterspace weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia, China, Iran, and others continue to pursue a wide range of space and counterspace activities, enabled by national policies, prioritized resources, and investments in supporting infrastructure. As General B. Chance Saltzman, the chief of space operations of the U.S. Space Force, noted in February 2023, “We are seeing a whole mix of weapons being produced by our strategic competitors.” Not only are these counterspace weapons in development and testing, but some have progressed to production and fielding in operational units. Such weapons could create disastrous effects for an array of national security, civil, and commercial users, especially if destructive weapons are employed that create orbital debris and render large swaths of popular orbits unusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impacts of counterspace weapons use are no longer limited to military users alone. Harm to commercial and international space assets will also reverberate across the expanding space economy. According to the Space Foundation, 90 countries operate in space. The value of the global space economy was $469 billion in 2021, with other analyses projecting it will increase to over $1.25 trillion in annual revenue by 2030. While over 5,400 satellites are in-orbit today, more than 24,500 satellites are anticipated to be launched in the next 10 years (2022–2031), over 70 percent of which will be commercial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This iteration of the Space Threat Assessment provides a framework that describes different types of counterspace weapons and a highlight of the main countries being tracked — China, Russia, India, Iran, North Korea, and others. The country sections include an overview of military space organizations, launch and satellite capabilities, and a brief review of counterspace developments. In addition, the report identifies key counterspace events in 2022, analyzes them in more detail, and provides a more comprehensive list of all notable counterspace activities and developments over the past year (January 2022–February 2023). The conclusion includes an analysis of notable trends and expectations for the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more detail on past counterspace weapons tests, including historical tests by the United States and the Soviet Union, please review the prior Space Threat Assessments (editions 2018–2022) or visit the project’s interactive &lt;a href=&quot;https://aerospace.csis.org/counterspace-timeline/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;timeline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;types-of-counterspace-weapons&quot;&gt;TYPES OF COUNTERSPACE WEAPONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is an increasingly important enabler of economic and military power. The strategic importance of space has led some nations to build arsenals of counterspace weapons to disrupt, degrade, or destroy space systems and hold at risk the ability of others to use the space domain. However, the strategic importance of space has also spurred renewed efforts to deter or mitigate conflict and protect the domain for peaceful uses. For example, the U.S. Space Force’s capstone publication on spacepower notes that “military space forces should make every effort to promote responsible norms of behavior that perpetuate space as a safe and open environment in accordance with the Laws of Armed Conflict, the Outer Space Treaty, and international law, as well as U.S. Government and DoD policy.” Similarly, the 2022 North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) Strategic Concept, adopted by NATO heads of state and government in June 2022, expresses the alliance’s commitment to upholding international law, promoting responsible behavior in space, and boosting the resilience of space capabilities. It further articulates that “secure use of and unfettered access to space” are key to effective deterrence and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterspace weapons, particularly those that produce orbital debris, pose a serious risk to the space environment and the ability of all nations to use the space domain for prosperity and security. This chapter provides an overview of different types of counterspace weapons, drawing on previous CSIS work to taxonomize them. Counterspace weapons vary significantly in the types of effects they create, how they are deployed, their detectability, their ability to be attributed to a source, and the level of technology and resources needed for their development and fielding. This report categorizes counterpace weapons into four broad groups of capabilities: kinetic physical, non-kinetic physical, electronic, and cyber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;kinetic-physical&quot;&gt;KINETIC PHYSICAL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kinetic physical counterspace weapons attempt to strike directly or detonate a warhead near a satellite or ground station. The three main forms of kinetic physical attack are direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, co-orbital ASAT weapons, and ground station attacks. Direct-ascent ASAT weapons are launched from Earth on a suborbital trajectory to strike a satellite in orbit, while co-orbital ASAT weapons are first placed into orbit and then later maneuvered into or near their intended target in orbit. These maneuvers are commonly known as rendezvous and proximity operations (RPOs). Attacks on ground stations are targeted at the terrestrial sites responsible for the command and control of satellites or the relay of satellite mission data to users. Such a ground station attack has the benefit of affecting many satellites in a constellation (that communicate with the ground station) rather than requiring multiple weapons to target individual satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kinetic physical attacks tend to cause irreversible damage to the systems affected and demonstrate a strong show of force that would likely be attributable and publicly visible. A successful kinetic physical attack in space will produce orbital debris, which can indiscriminately affect other satellites in similar orbits. These types of attacks are one of the only counterspace actions that carry the potential for the direct loss of human life if targeted at crewed ground stations or at satellites in orbits where humans are present, such as the International Space Station (ISS) in low Earth orbit (LEO). To date, no country has conducted a kinetic physical attack against another country’s satellite, but four countries — the United States, Russia, China, and India — have successfully tested direct-ascent ASAT weapons against their own satellites. The Soviet Union also tested co-orbital kinetic ASAT weapons as early as the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;non-kinetic-physical&quot;&gt;NON-KINETIC PHYSICAL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-kinetic physical counterspace weapons have physical effects on satellites or ground systems without making physical contact. Lasers can be used to temporarily dazzle or permanently blind the sensors on satellites or cause components to overheat. High-powered microwave (HPM) weapons can disrupt a satellite’s electronics or cause permanent damage to electrical circuits and processors in a satellite. A nuclear device detonated in space can create a high-radiation environment and an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) with indiscriminate effects on satellites in affected orbits. Non-kinetic attacks operate at the speed of light and, in some cases, can be less visible to third-party observers and more difficult to attribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satellites can be targeted with lasers and HPM weapons from ground- or ship-based sites, airborne platforms, or other satellites. A satellite lasing system requires high beam quality, adaptive optics (if being used through the atmosphere), and advanced pointing control to steer the laser beam precisely — technology that is costly and requires a high degree of sophistication. A laser can only be effective against a sensor on a satellite if it is within the field of view of the sensor, making it possible to attribute the attack to its approximate geographical origin. An HPM weapon can be used to disrupt a satellite’s electronics, corrupt data stored in memory, cause processors to restart, and, at higher power levels, cause permanent damage to electrical circuits and processors. HPM attacks can be more difficult to attribute because the attack can come from a variety of angles, including from other satellites passing by in orbit. For both laser and HPM weapons, the attacker may have limited ability to know if the attack was successful because it is not likely to produce visible indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of a nuclear weapon in space would have large-scale, indiscriminate effects that would be attributable and publicly visible. A nuclear detonation in space would immediately affect satellites within range of its EMP, and it would also create a high-radiation environment that would accelerate the degradation of satellite components over the long term for unshielded satellites in the affected orbital regime. The detonation of nuclear weapons in space is banned under the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963, which has more than 100 signatories, though this does not include China or North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electronic&quot;&gt;ELECTRONIC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic counterspace weapons target the electromagnetic spectrum through which space systems transmit and receive data. Jamming devices interfere with communications to or from satellites by generating noise in the same radio frequency (RF) band. An uplink jammer interferes with the signal going from Earth to a satellite, such as the command and control uplink. Downlink jammers target the signal from a satellite as it propagates down to users on Earth. Spoofing is a form of electronic attack where the attacker tricks a receiver into believing a fake signal, produced by the attacker, is the real signal it is trying to receive. A spoofer can be used to inject false information into a data stream or, in extremis, to issue false commands to a satellite to disrupt its operations. User terminals with omnidirectional antennas, such as many GPS receivers and satellite phones, have a wider field of view and thus are susceptible to downlink jamming and spoofing from a wider range of angles on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic forms of attack can be difficult to detect or distinguish from accidental interference, making attribution and awareness more difficult. Both jamming and spoofing are reversible forms of attack because communications can return to normal once the jamming signal is removed. Through a type of spoofing called “meaconing,” even encrypted military P(Y) GPS signal can be spoofed. Meaconing does not require cracking the encryption because it merely rebroadcasts a time-delayed copy of the original signal without decrypting it or altering the data. The technology needed to jam and spoof many types of satellite signals is commercially available and inexpensive, making it relatively easy to proliferate among state and non-state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber&quot;&gt;CYBER&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While electronic forms of attack attempt to interfere with the transmission of RF signals, cyberattacks target the data itself and the systems that use, transmit, and control the flow of data. Cyberattacks on satellites can be used to monitor data traffic patterns, intercept data, or insert false or corrupted data or commands in a system. These attacks can target ground stations, end-user equipment, or the satellites themselves. While cyberattacks require a high degree of understanding of the systems being targeted, they do not necessarily require significant resources to conduct. The barrier to entry is relatively low, and cyberattacks can be contracted out to private groups or individuals. Even if a state or non-state actor lacks internal cyber capabilities, it may still pose a cyber threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cyberattack on space systems can result in the loss of data or services being provided by a satellite, which could have widespread systemic effects if used against a system such as GPS. Cyberattacks could have permanent effects if, for example, an adversary seizes control of a satellite through its command and control system. An attacker could shut down all communications and permanently damage the satellite by issuing commands that cause it to expend propellant or damage its electronics and sensors. Accurate and timely attribution of a cyberattack can be difficult because attackers can use a variety of methods to conceal their identity, such as using hijacked servers, when launching an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;china&quot;&gt;CHINA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China continues to make progress toward its goal of becoming the world leader in space. Over the past year, China has continued to grow its space and counterspace assets, maintaining its status as the second-most-capable space nation after the United States. To enable these capabilities, China operates four spaceports and a family of Long March space launch vehicles (SLVs) that can deliver a wide range of satellites to different orbital altitudes. In 2022, China conducted 64 space launches, including two space launch failures. The successful launches resulted in over 150 satellites successfully placed into orbit and the launch of one orbital and one suborbital spaceplane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civil, intelligence, and military space capabilities are a priority for China as it continues to invest in and plan for greater use and access to space in the coming decade. In November 2022, China completed the construction of the Tiangong space station, which is now operational. Beijing has released two white papers on space activities, in 2016 and 2021, which not only outline a vision for future space activities but also integrate space into other strategic global initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-organization&quot;&gt;SPACE ORGANIZATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China has separate organizations charged with managing its civil and military space activities, much of the technology for both civil and military space capabilities is produced by the same state-owned enterprises. The line between commercial and governmental endeavors is often blurred by Beijing’s military-civilian fusion policy, which encourages such enterprises to acquire and divert cutting-edge technologies, including space technology, to achieve both economic and military dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The China National Space Administration (CNSA) leads all civil space missions. The CNSA falls within the purview of the State Council’s State Administration for Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense. China’s space program primarily contracts through the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, a stateowned enterprise with many sectors that researches and develops SLVs, spacecraft, missile systems (including intercontinental ballistic missiles), and supporting ground equipment. Finally, the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation is another state-owned enterprise which specializes in space technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military organization for space capabilities, the Strategic Support Force (SSF), sits alongside other information-centric domains, such as cyber, within China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Founded in 2015, the SSF manages space warfare, space launch, and the acquisition and operation of satellites. Within the SSF, the Space Systems Department and Network Systems Department divide responsibilities and act as co-equal semi-independent branches, with the former managing space and counterspace capabilities and the latter leading the cyber, electronic, and psychological warfare mission areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-launch-capabilities&quot;&gt;SPACE LAUNCH CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China broke its launch record in 2022, surpassing its previous record of 55 launches set in 2021. The vast majority of these missions were launched on the Long March SLV family of rockets. The Long March-2 (variants C, D, and F), -3B, -4C, -5, -5B, -6, -7, -8, and -11 rockets provide light-, medium-, and heavy-lift capability to LEO and geostationary orbit (GEO). Some are capable of launching from a sea-based platform, but most launch from traditional groundbased launch pads. Newer Long March vehicles are being developed, including the Long March-9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These SLVs are typically launched from one of four sites in China. The Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, located in Inner Mongolia, was founded in 1958 and is the country’s oldest space launch facility. This is the most popular launch site and has been the site of the majority of the country’s space tests and launches, including the launch of China’s first satellite in 1970, and the first international payload launched from the country in 1992. The Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center, located in Wuzhai, Shanxi, is another popular launch site with a history of space and ballistic missile launches dating back to 1968. The Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center also has test and assembly capabilities on campus and launches vehicles too large for the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The other two Chinese launch sites were both built to support human, interplanetary, and lunar missions. Located in the Sichuan region, the Xichang Satellite Launch Center (Songlin) was finalized in 1984, but because of its close proximity to populated areas has now become a backup launch site to China’s most recent addition, the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center. The coastal Wenchang Satellite Launch Center, located on the island province of Hainan in the South China Sea, has hosted 16 launches since opening in 2014. Officials have announced plans to further develop Wenchang as a commercial spaceport with satellite assembly, testing, and data centers on-site. In addition to these launch sites, China is capable of launching from mobile platforms in the Yellow Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a shift in the last decade for the Chinese commercial industry. In 2014, the Chinese government lifted a restrictive policy prohibiting the creation of commercial space launch companies and commercial launch technology, which has resulted in private and state investment into the commercial market. Today, the government may look to the commercial sector as an opportunity to replace China’s reliance on international companies or suppliers. Similar to trends in other dominant space-faring nations, many commercial companies are focusing on launch capabilities. The first commercial space launch from China is expected in the first months of 2023 from Beijing Tianbing Technology Co., Ltd., also known as Space Pioneer, which plans to launch a Tianlong-2 medium-lift vehicle from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-spaceplane-program&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s Spaceplane Program&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Spaceplane programs are often extremely secretive, and the Chinese program is no exception. Spaceplanes launch from traditional SLVs, spend their operational mission continuously orbiting the Earth, and re-enter the atmosphere and land like a traditional airplane. The U.S. Space Shuttle is a famous larger cousin of the spaceplanes in operation today.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In August 2022, China launched two different spaceplanes, one orbital and one suborbital, from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. As is typical with many emerging Chinese space technologies, few details have surfaced about either vehicle.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The first test of a Chinese spaceplane was in September 2020 and was launched by a Long March 2F. That spaceplane traveled in LEO for two days, released an object capable of broadcasting transmissions, and concluded its test flight by landing in northwest China. The second test of this vehicle launched on another Long March 2F on August 4, 2022. After a successful launch and almost two months in LEO, the spaceplane raised its orbit on October 23 before releasing an object. Although it is not clear from publicly available data when exactly the spaceplane released its object, the U.S. Space Force space tracking database recognized the object on October 31, 2022. There have been few details released since, and a Google translation of reporting from state media has only indicated that the spaceplane will remain in orbit for “a period of time.” As of March 16, 2023, the orbital spaceplane is still believed to be in LEO. Available images of the Chinese spaceplane show that it bears a resemblance to the United States’ X-37B spaceplane, which completed a sixth mission in November 2022, after spending 908 days in orbit, and shows a Chinese interest in matching U.S. capabilities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China launched its suborbital spaceplane for a second time on August 26, 2022, following an initial test in September 2019 on a Long March 2D rocket. A statement from the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation confirmed that this launch vehicle was re-used, making it the country’s first successful demonstration of a reusable space launch capability. Reporting from China indicates a large amount of funding to be allocated to a suborbital transport project capable of carrying passengers. Though the suborbital spaceplane was confirmed to have landed, reports have not confirmed the duration or altitude of its flight. China is also developing a similar launching project, called the Tengyun project, which will incorporate a horizontal takeoff and landing capability to increase the ease and speed of space launches.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There are no indications that a spaceplane capability would act as a counterspace weapon, but because of the apparent capacity to release objects while in orbit, this could progress to a co-orbital ASAT capability.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;satellite-capabilities&quot;&gt;SATELLITE CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China maintains an extensive suite of satellite capabilities, including advanced positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT); satellite communications; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); missile warning; and space situational awareness. According to a 2022 U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency report, China doubled its number of satellites in orbit between 2019 and 2021, from 250 to 499, and surpassed all but the United States in the number of space startups receiving funding, drawing 16 percent of total global investment in these ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable capabilities include the Beidou constellation, made of 35 PNT satellites, which acts as China’s alternative to GPS. Satellite capabilities such as Beidou are increasingly used as tools for the Digital Silk Road and Belt and Road Initiatives. Similarly, China has released plans for a 13,000-satellite constellation in LEO for broadband communications purposes. This would be the country’s answer to SpaceX’s Starlink network and would aim to serve customers across China and underdeveloped internet markets across the globe. In 2019, China introduced the Belt and Road Space Information Corridor to build out Chinese space applications and services in other nations. Just two years later, in its 2021 space white paper, Beijing commended the successes of the corridor, highlighting expanding satellite research and development infrastructure in Egypt, Pakistan, and Nigeria as examples. Chinese commercial companies continue to develop capabilities as well; in 2021, space-mining start-up Origin Space launched a space debris cleanup prototype into LEO. The company claims this capability will be able to remove space debris, potentially with a net, though there are no reports of the satellite’s on-orbit tests or RPO activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;counterspace-assessment-overview&quot;&gt;COUNTERSPACE ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China continues to develop and deploy a robust arsenal of space and counterspace capabilities, U.S. officials continue to view the country as a significant counterspace threat. China maintains a substantial kinetic ASAT capability, most notably demonstrated by a debris-creating 2007 test, as well as numerous subsequent non-intercept tests in the years since. Co-orbital technology demonstrations prove China’s ability to rendezvous with other satellites in GEO. While these are not counterspace weapons tests, they demonstrate capability that is necessary for a co-orbital counterspace attack. Non-kinetic counterspace weapons, such as high-powered lasers or microwaves, remain largely classified or are not publicly known to have been tested. However, in a 2021 threat report, the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence indicated that China has ground-based lasers capable of blinding or damaging optical sensors on low-altitude satellites. Reporting from 2022 indicated that Chinese universities are also working on small laser devices capable of being mounted on a satellite, though this is not a current capability. China’s jamming and spoofing electronic warfare capabilities have been verified in use against space and non-space signals alike. Few Chinese cyberattacks on space systems have been recorded in the last five years, but China’s cyber capabilities in other domains form a solid foundation for potential cyber counterspace capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also maintains significant space surveillance capabilities, which are required to effectively target and employ their counterspace weapons. The country has maintained a fleet of space-tracking ships for years, which set sail for months-long space-tracking and monitoring missions. The ships are reportedly capable of monitoring missions including Beidou satellites and the Chang’e lunar missions. In November 2022, China unveiled the SLC-18 radar, which is reportedly designed to “search, detect, and track objects such as ballistic missiles and LEO satellites.” This may be an updated design to the previous JY-26 “Skywatch” long-range air surveillance system debuted in 2014. Global space surveillance capabilities are an additional component of the country’s Belt and Road Initiative. China has had success building space surveillance infrastructure, particularly ground stations, in countries around the world, including as far away as South America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHINA DOUBLED ITS NUMBER OF SATELLITES IN ORBIT BETWEEN 2019 AND 2021, FROM 250 TO 499.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;rendezvous-and-proximity-operations&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Rendezvous and Proximity Operations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has a long history of satellites capable of performing on-orbit RPOs, commonly in GEO. As reported in last year’s assessment, the Shijian 21 (SJ-21) was launched in October 2021 as an experimental space debris mitigation satellite, which separated from its upper stage apogee kick motor (AKM). SJ-21 performed RPO maneuvers around the AKM before moving to rendezvous with a defunct Beidou satellite, Compass G2. AKMs are additional power sources that help place a satellite into a specific orbit. Since GEO is a highly valued orbit, most AKMs in GEO are released in a manner such that they separate and put significant distance between the payload and the AKM, so as not to interfere with satellite operations in GEO. Previous reporting suggests that SJ-21 performed several RPOs around Compass G2 before docking and moving the defunct satellite into a GEO graveyard orbit, hundreds of kilometers above the traditional GEO belt. Updated information showcases that SJ-21 took Compass G2 significantly higher than a typical graveyard orbit, which is highly unusual for a debris removal mission.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Two additional Chinese rendezvous technology research satellites, SJ-12-01 and -02 were launched into GEO in early 2022. Soon after, the satellites engaged with a U.S. Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program space surveillance satellite in a “catand-mouse game” spanning several days. Each time the U.S. satellite would approach either SJ-12 satellite, the Chinese satellites would quickly maneuver away. These activities have been corroborated by commercial company COMSPOC and highlight the RPO capabilities China has successfully developed and maintained in orbit.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s first successful orbital launch of 2023 was on January 6. Shijian 23 (SJ-23) launched on a Long March 7 from the Wenchang Satellite Launching Center. SJ-23 reached its GEO orbit on January 15 and one day later a second object appeared to be tracked — another suspected AKM.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russia&quot;&gt;RUSSIA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the three dominant national space actors, Russia retains substantial space capabilities and forces, many dating back to the Soviet Union. However, Moscow finds itself at an inflection point. Over the past year, Russia has continued to display less advanced space and counterspace capabilities than originally anticipated. Advanced counterspace weapons that were promised, such as the Peresvet and Sokol-Eshelon ground-based lasers, are nowhere to be seen on the battlefield despite Russian claims of their success. Furthermore, reports have surfaced that the Russian space industrial base is suffering from sanctions, an aging population, corruption, and bloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in 2022, Russia used space capabilities and counterspace weapons more than ever before. Widespread reports of jamming throughout Eastern Europe have been attributed to Russia, as have several distinct attacks on commercial space architectures, such as Viasat and SpaceX’s Starlink system. Moreover, Moscow continues to play a “cat-and-mouse” game in orbit, using its satellites to shadow other nations’ satellites and creating confusion and concern about the intent of these actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-organization-1&quot;&gt;SPACE ORGANIZATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military and civil space organizations remain mostly separate in Russia, with the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) leading military efforts and Roscosmos leading those on the civil side. Within the VKS, military space and counterspace capabilities fall within the Russian Space Forces, established in 2015. The Russian Space Forces’ mission includes space situational awareness, missile warning, space launch, satellite operations, and counterspace operations. Roscosmos leads on human spaceflight, the GLONASS PNT system, and international space partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-launch-capabilities-1&quot;&gt;SPACE LAUNCH CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space launch capabilities are a cornerstone for Russia’s military and civilian space programs. Providing space launch via the Soyuz rocket — which has been in operation for over 50 years — has brought in significant revenue for Russia over the years through the sale of payload space or seats for astronauts. In fact, to maintain U.S. presence on the ISS between the 2011 decommissioning of the U.S. Space Shuttle and the 2020 launch of SpaceX’s Dragon capsule to the ISS with two U.S. astronauts, Moscow carried 71 U.S. astronauts to the station at a cost of approximately $56 million per seat. In total, these launches cost the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) approximately $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MOSCOW FINDS ITSELF AT AN INFLECTION POINT.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;new-direction-for-roscosmos&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;New Direction for Roscosmos&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Of note, in July 2022, Dimitry Rogozin was replaced by Yuri Borisov, a former deputy defense minister, as the head of Roscosmos. This leadership change was possibly a demotion for both men: Rogozin for his erratic Twitter posts and bluster surrounding Russia’s decoupling from the ISS, and Borisov for his poor military leadership in Russia’s war on Ukraine&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xEUTYJ0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia successfully launched 22 times in 2022. This pace is slightly behind 2021 and pre-pandemic years. Notably, Russia lost significant international launch customers after its invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. For example, just before a scheduled launch in early 2022, Roscosmos demanded that OneWeb not use any of its satellites to support military activities. After receiving no such reassurances, Roscosmos took a Soyuz launch vehicle containing 36 OneWeb satellites off the launch pad on March 4, 2022. The 36 satellites remain in storage in Russia. Due to the seizure of their satellites and the invasion of Ukraine, OneWeb canceled all future launches through Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a partial failure of Russia’s heavylaunch Angara 5 in December 2021, Russia’s lighter launch vehicle, the Angara 1.2, successfully launched twice in 2022, carrying two undisclosed military satellites into LEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, both satellites de-orbited and burned up in the Earth’s atmosphere within two months. Angara 1.2 is expected to conduct an additional launch in late 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia maintains three main launch sites: Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Plesetsk Cosmodrome in the northwest of the country, and the Vostochny Cosmodrome in the east. Baikonur is typically used for cosmonaut launches to the ISS, while Plesetsk is used for many military space launches, including a November 2021 direct-ascent ASAT test. President Vladimir Putin visited the Vostochny Cosmodrome in April 2022 to celebrate Cosmonautics Day, a holiday commemorating Yuri Gargarin’s successful mission as the first human in space. Putin was accompanied by Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko for bilateral meetings and a tour of the site. Once fully operational, Vostochny is expected to host 45 percent of all Russian launches, shifting significant work from Baikonur to the new domestic launch site. The 2023 Angara 1.2 launch is planned for Vostochny Cosmodrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;satellite-capabilities-1&quot;&gt;SATELLITE CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia maintains a fleet of highly capable satellites providing support to a variety of civil and military missions, including human spaceflight, deep space exploration, missile warning, communications, command and control, ISR, and weather. While many of these capabilities were developed in the 1990s or early 2000s, some are being revitalized. A national PNT system called GLONASS has been operational since 1993 and provides navigation capabilities to the Russian military and civilians, much like the United States’ own GPS. Updates to GLONASS are ongoing, and three new GLONASS satellites were launched in 2022. Several ISR and communications satellites were also launched in 2022 to complement or restore existing constellations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Federal Space Program 2016-2025, a policy and budgetary plan for its space projects, set ambitious goals, including increased bandwidth for communications satellites, additional remote sensing satellites, upgrades to the Russian segment of the ISS, and the completion of the Vostochny Cosmodrome. However, since enacting this policy, Moscow’s space budgets have continued to shrink. Sanctions enacted after the 2014 invasion of Crimea have significantly hampered the Russian space industry. Furthermore, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, additional sanctions were imposed on the aerospace industry by the United States and its allies, and joint projects were suspended by Russia’s international partners, such as the ExoMars rover mission with the European Space Agency. With shrinking budgets, expanding sanctions, and continued economic stagnation, Russia has focused its efforts on streamlining current space capabilities, specifically revitalizing Soviet-era programs and investing in dual-use space technologies — those with both military and civil uses. This strategy is a clear response to Russia’s burgeoning challenges in its national space enterprise. Many of these dual-use capabilities are discussed in the following section on Russian counterspace threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;counterspace-assessment-overview-1&quot;&gt;COUNTERSPACE ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has a proven, well-rounded suite of counterspace weapons. Many of this year’s updates to Russia’s counterspace capabilities are found in the “Featured Analysis” section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kinetic Physical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2021, Russia successfully tested a direct-ascent ASAT in LEO. The test partially destroyed a defunct Soviet-era satellite, Cosmos 1408, via a Nudol (PL-19) missile interceptor. Russia has tested the Nudol system almost yearly since 2014, but this was the first intercept on orbit that created space debris. Of the 1,783 pieces of orbital debris tracked from the test, only 661 were still in orbit as of September 2022. However, the remaining pieces are at a higher altitude, which mean the debris will remain in orbit longer, until around 2033. Some of this debris is in a similar orbit to the ISS, which had to move three times in 2022 to avoid the debris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2018, a modified Russian MiG31 fighter jet was photographed carrying an unidentified missile that was reportedly a “mock-up” of an air-launched ASAT weapon. Reports now suggest that this missile system is the Burevestnik. Little to no details are confirmed about the ASAT capability, but the capability is not new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-orbital weapons are hard to identify and track in orbit. However, unusual or threatening behavior can provide insight into capabilities and intent. Russia has a long history of unusual and threatening behavior in both LEO and GEO and conducted similar activities in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luch, Russia’s well-known GEO inspector satellite, maneuvered several times in 2022 to closely approach and loiter near three different Intelsat communications satellites. For more information on Luch and its activities during Russia’s war on Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-kinetic Physical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that Russia has developed a new ground-based ASAT laser system, dubbed Kalina. Part of Russia’s Krona space surveillance station located in southwest Russia near the Black Sea, Kalina may be capable of dazzling or blinding satellites. It is unclear if this system is operational or capable of counterspace attacks, but it is a notable development for experts to monitor as progress on the facilities continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Available open-source reporting indicates that GPS jamming is occurring around Moscow, and observers speculate that it is to protect the capital city from being targeted by Ukrainian drones. Russia has been installing jammers capable of denying GPS on domestic infrastructure, such as cell towers. The 2020 edition of this report highlighted how mobile GPS jamming vehicles accompany President Putin to ensure the leader’s personal safety and how GPS jamming may be used near the Kremlin. More information on how jamming has been used in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine can be found in the “Featured Analysis” section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has demonstrated significant cyber capabilities, as showcased with its February 2022 Viasat hack. For more on this attack, please see “Featured Analysis” section. Recent reports have emerged on another successful cyber intrusion against a U.S. commercial satellite communications provider. In November 2022, an analyst from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security stated at a conference that the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear successfully infiltrated a satellite communications network. The intruders were supposedly in the network for months before detection. Fancy Bear is a Russian state-sponsored advanced persistent threat group tracked by the U.S. government and confirmed to be part of the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate’s 85th Main Special Service Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;cosmos-2558s-early-mission&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cosmos 2558’s Early Mission&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In early August 2022, it was reported that Russian satellite Cosmos 2558 performed a close approach with USA 326, a U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) satellite, in LEO. Cosmos 2558 was likely close enough to image or collect signals intelligence from USA 326, but current reporting suggests it did not interfere with, deny, or degrade operations of the NRO satellite. With the speed at which satellites travel in LEO, the flyby of Cosmos 2558 would have happened relatively quickly and possibly within a couple of hours. General James H. Dickinson, commander of U.S. Space Command, spoke about this dangerously close approach to NBC News on August 9, 2022. A unique aspect of this mission was how early it occurred in the satellite’s lifetime. Cosmos 2558 was launched into space on August 1, 2022, and the close approach happened only three days later, on August 4. Following the approach, Cosmos 2558 adjusted its position in early September 2022 to stay within the same orbital plane as USA 326.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;possible-sar-jamming&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Possible SAR Jamming&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In June and July 2021, a defense blog reported on a potential electronic warfare attack on the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1B synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery satellite. As of March 2023, this attack remains unconfirmed, but it is suspected that Russian forces were able to affect the European SAR satellite as it imaged Russian territory near the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea. After this report, the findings were highly questioned on Twitter, leaving it unclear if the satellite itself experienced SAR jamming or radar interference in the region. However, Moscow is reported to possess SAR-jamming capability, specifically its Krasukha-2/-4 mobile electronic warfare systems, which can jam both airborne and space-based radar systems. Possibly unrelated but worth mentioning is that Sentinel-1B suffered an anomaly in December 2021 that affected the satellite’s SAR antenna power system, leaving the satellite unable to collect SAR data. The European Space Agency declared “the capability of Sentinel-1B to support the mission is therefore considered lost,” and surmised that the probable cause of failure was the soldering processed used to repair a ceramic capacitor during the assembly and manufacturing of the satellite.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-war-on-ukraine&quot;&gt;RUSSIA’S WAR ON UKRAINE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant space-related developments in 2022 center on Russia and its war on Ukraine. This edition of the Space Threat Assessment takes an in-depth look at Russian counterspace activities in this context. There has been an unparalleled level of transparency on the battlefield in Ukraine: sensitive intelligence was declassified to reveal Moscow’s plans and intentions, imagery showed the massing of Russian forces, and social media posts conveyed the war’s horrors up close. Space capabilities are aiding in this transparency and making an impactful contribution to this fight. Communications satellites are empowering Ukrainian forces and connecting the Ukrainian people with the outside world. Imagery satellites, some able to penetrate clouds and collect pictures at night, are watching the movement of Russian forces, mapping humanitarian evacuation routes, and collecting evidence of war crimes. Other satellites can detect and locate the sources of GPS interference, which is causing Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to alter course. Some observers have described this war as the “first commercial space war” due to the prominence of Western space industry capabilities enabling Ukraine’s resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as with any advantage on the battlefield, adversaries quickly look for ways to erode that edge, and the same is true for space. This featured analysis details Russian employment of electronic warfare and cyberattacks against space systems, uncertainty on Russian use of laser weapons, and unusual behavior by a Russian inspector satellite in GEO. While the space lessons learned in Ukraine are still to be written, there may be insights to glean on Moscow’s space strategy and doctrine, and lessons for the United States to apply to threats in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Eh3lvwH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s attacks against space capabilities used by Ukraine are an example of how counterspace weapons can and will likely be used prior to and during future conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;jamming-and-cyberattacks&quot;&gt;JAMMING AND CYBERATTACKS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months before the invasion, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) was monitoring the Ukraine-Russia border using UAVs to perform overflight missions. The fleet of UAVs operated by the OSCE uses the unprotected civilian GPS signal to aid in their navigation. Throughout March and April 2021, over 60 percent of the OSCE’s UAV flights encountered GPS signal interference, including in areas near the OSCE base (approximately 25 kilometers from the contact line). These events were corroborated through RF signal sensing from a commercial space company which confirmed detection of GPS interference in the areas where OSCE UAVs were attempting to carry out the monitoring mission. The day before the invasion, on February 23, 2022, Ukrainian government sources stated that a longrange UAV experienced significant GPS interference, which caused a temporary loss of control of the aircraft. Open-source defense analysts from Janes assess that the long-range UAV was a Turkish Bayraktar (TB-2) drone operated by Ukraine and that the counter-UAV electronic warfare system was the Russian Krasukha-4. Russian employment of GPS-jamming devices has continued throughout the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond electronic warfare against GPS systems, Russia moved to deny Ukrainian command and control systems enabled by commercial communications satellites. An hour before Russian troops invaded on February 24, 2022, Russia conducted a cyberattack to deny connectivity between the Viasat communications KA-SAT network and its thousands of ground terminals. The attack entered through a virtual private network and deployed wiper malware that crashed terrestrial modems via the satellite downlink. One of Viasat’s customers was the target: the Ukrainian government and military. However, the attack indiscriminately affected other Viasat users in Europe, including disabling about one-fifth of wind turbines and internet users across Central Europe. In light of the attack against Viasat, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and CISA released a joint statement to commercial satellite communications providers urging companies to reinforce the cybersecurity and resilience of their networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the successful cyberattack on Viasat, the Ukrainian government sought help from Elon Musk and SpaceX to help the country restore connectivity through commercial LEO broadband. Only four days after the initial invasion, thousands of Starlink terminals were successfully delivered to Ukraine and reconnected the Ukrainian government and civilians to the internet. Russia attempted to jam SpaceX’s Starlink ground terminals to break Ukrainian communications once again. However, SpaceX was able to quickly counter the attack, and services have not been seriously disrupted since this first attempt in March 2022. According to U.S. Department of Defense leadership, Starlink was able to combat jamming by fixing lines of code, making the Russian attack ineffective. Starlink continues to face attempted jamming by Russian systems, but “their success has been limited.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional jamming has been observed throughout the conflict and in various locations. In March 2022, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) released the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the current context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the issue of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) jamming and/or possible spoofing has intensified in geographical areas surrounding the conflict zone and other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Eurocontrol, Network of Analysts and open-source data reports analyzed by EASA indicate that since February 24, 2022, there are four key geographical areas where GNSS interference (spoofing or jamming) has intensified, namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kaliningrad region, surrounding Baltic sea and neighboring States;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eastern Finland;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Black Sea; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Eastern Mediterranean area near Cyprus, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria and Israel, as well as Northern Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These locations have all experienced significant interference with PNT systems such as GPS and Galileo. Data from commercial RF data analytics company, Spire Global, corroborated GNSS interference over the Eastern Mediterranean in the February 2022 time frame, as shown on page 18. Additionally, reports of GPS jamming emerged just after Finnish president Sauli Niinistö met with U.S. president Joe Biden in Washington, D.C. Finnair also reported several occurrences of GPS jamming when its commercial airliners flew near Kaliningrad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reports of ground-based electronic warfare devices being used in Ukraine, possibly including the Krasukha-4, RB-109A “Bylina,” R-330ZH Zhitel, Borisoglebsk-2, and Tirada-2, which all have the capability to deny or disrupt GPS or satellite communications through uplink and downlink jamming. Many of these come from reported captures of Russian vehicles and systems during the war — often from videos or images posted on social media. However, there is little concrete confirmation on which of these jamming devices have been used. While it is unclear which systems are deployed by Russia, it is clear that jamming has been widespread and frequent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lasing-and-dazzling&quot;&gt;LASING AND DAZZLING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of ISR satellites to enable Ukraine’s tactical operations has been astounding. Given the advantage commercial ISR satellites has provided to Ukraine, it is surprising that Russia has failed to employ more counterspace weapons to erode this advantage. In May 2022, Russian deputy prime minister Yuri Borisov claimed that the country had successfully destroyed a Ukrainian UAV using its Zadira laser weapon. According to Borisov, the Zadira weapon is more powerful and damaging than its predecessor, the Peresvet. Borisov stated in a TV interview that “if Peresvet blinds an object, the new generation of laser weapons physically destroys the target. It is burned up.” Officials from both the United States and Ukraine commented that these reports have not been substantiated, and there is little evidence to prove that the attack occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite much boasting of capability, there are no independently verified reports of Russia deploying directed-energy capabilities against satellites in its war on Ukraine. Russian officials have showcased the Peresvet in recent years, a ground-based satellite laser. In 2021, President Putin announced that this laser would be adapted for an airborne platform. Another touted capability is the Sokol-Eshelon, an airborne laser system that is a revival of a Soviet-era program, which has the stated capability to attack satellites in LEO. Neither of these capabilities have been employed in the Ukrainian conflict despite the high volume of remote sensing satellites and other platforms that are providing data and intelligence on Russian troop positions to the Ukrainian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 26, 2022, at the United Nations General Assembly, Konstantin Vorontsov, the deputy director of the Russian foreign ministry’s department of nonproliferation and arms, warned that “quasi-civilian infrastructure may become a legitimate target for retaliation.” This indicates that Moscow considers commercial companies providing services to governments and militaries as legitimate targets in times of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;co-orbital-rendezvous-and-proximity-operations&quot;&gt;CO-ORBITAL RENDEZVOUS AND PROXIMITY OPERATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Russian inspector satellite Luch may also be supporting Russia’s war on Ukraine through signals intelligence gathering in GEO. At the beginning of 2020, Luch made a significant maneuver westward, covering about 60 degrees in longitude. As it moved, Luch had the opportunity to conduct multiple close approaches with other satellites. However, a year later, in March 2021 — just months after Russia began its initial military buildup near the Ukrainian border — Luch made a significant maneuver back eastward to visit another Russian satellite in GEO, Cosmos 2520, and an Azerbaijani satellite, Azerspace-2/Intelsat 38. Luch then maneuvered and loitered near Intelsat 33e from October 2021 through January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As corroborated by data and analysis from commercial space domain awareness company Slingshot Aerospace, Luch moved to rendezvous with Intelsat 39, a high-throughput communications satellite with European coverage, one month before Russia invaded Ukraine. Since the war began, Luch has been performing proximity operations near Intelsat satellites and loitering nearby for about 150 days at each satellite — a significant departure from Luch’s nominal operations since typical loiter times are much less. Notably, these Intelsat satellites are transmitting Ku- and C-band frequencies (which are often used for secure military communications) over Ukraine, although it is unclear if they are supporting any military operations in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;india&quot;&gt;INDIA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India catapulted onto the global counterspace stage in 2019 when it launched its first (and only) ASAT test, becoming only the fourth country to successfully demonstrate a direct-ascent ASAT capability. The Indian space sector continued to grow throughout 2022, with a particular focus on military and private satellite imagery. In October 2022, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a new Mission Defense Space Program, where New Delhi highlighted 75 defense space mission areas for private companies to focus on. These 75 missions were separated into five broad categories of space technology for both civilian and military operations: satellite, launch, software, ground systems, and communications and payload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-organization-2&quot;&gt;SPACE ORGANIZATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s space program has historically focused on civil and scientific missions, though the past five years have seen expanded military activity. The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) is the civilian branch of India’s national space program and has evolved into the sixth-largest space agency in the world. The ISRO operates under the Department of Space, which is headed by the prime minister. Founded in April 2019, the Defence Space Agency (DSA) is charged with upholding India’s national security concerns in space and operates under the Ministry of Defence. The DSA — a collaborative effort between India’s air force, army, and navy — is led by an air force vice marshal and is responsible for the country’s direct-ascent ASAT capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its subsidiary, the Defence Space Research Organisation (DSRO), also established in 2019, absorbed the country’s previous military space agencies, including the Defence Satellite Control Centre and the Defence Imagery Processing and Analysis Centre. The DSRO is led by a senior defense scientist and is responsible for the development of “space warfare systems and associated technology.” There is little documentation on either organization to further describe mandates, goals, or direction. India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) was founded in 1958 as the primary research and development wing of the Ministry of Defence. The DRDO leads the development of electronic warfare systems, missiles, and radars, among other systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-launch-capabilities-2&quot;&gt;SPACE LAUNCH CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India has three major launch sites in the country: the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, the oldest ISRO launch facility in India, which houses the design and development of SLVs; the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, the most popular ISRO launch site due to its geographic superiority; and the Abdul Kalam Island site, which is operated by the DRDO and hosts the Integrated Test Range missile testing facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India currently has four active SLVs that are capable of successfully delivering spacecraft to orbit, with at least one new launch vehicle in the testing stage of development. The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) has been India’s most successful and versatile vehicle, capable of successfully delivering a variety of payloads to orbit. The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) focuses on delivering communication satellites to GEO. The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark-III (LVM3) is a next-generation versatile vehicle, which can launch communication satellites twice the size of its GSLV predecessor as well as deliver payloads of up to 10 tons to LEO. The ISRO’s first launch in 2023 debuted the agency’s new Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV-D2), launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre. It placed an ISRO Earth observation satellite into orbit along with two private sector satellites — one commercial and one academic. This SSLV-D2 was developed to offer a more available and affordable launch service to the private sector, focusing on small satellite launches. Two other launch vehicles are in development, the Human Rated Launch Vehicle (HRLV), a follow-on to the LVM3, and the Reusable Launch Vehicle-Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD). In total, the ISRO has launched 381 foreign satellites from 1999 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country had four successful launches and one failure in 2022: three PSLV launches that placed 15 satellites into orbit, one GSLV launch that delivered 36 OneWeb satellites into orbit, and one failure of the SSLV launcher. With support from the ISRO, Indian start-up Skyroot Aerospace successfully tested the country’s first private industry launch vehicle, the Vikram-S, in November 2022 in hopes of an operational launch sometime in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;INDIA’S SPACE PROGRAM HAS HISTORICALLY FOCUSED ON CIVIL AND SCIENTIFIC MISSIONS, THOUGH THE PAST FIVE YEARS HAVE SEEN EXPANDED MILITARY ACTIVITY.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;satellite-capabilities-2&quot;&gt;SATELLITE CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India has over 60 satellites on orbit, the majority of which serve civilian or research purposes, and boasts “the largest civilian remote sensing satellite constellation.” Additionally, India has successfully launched two missions to the Moon. Chandrayaan-1 was an orbiter launched in 2008 with a mission life of two years. A decade later, Chandrayaan-2 was launched, a complex mission that consisted of an orbiter, lander, and rover to further explore the south pole of the Moon. The orbiter was able to maneuver to successfully reach its intended orbit and has an estimated mission life of seven years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country has a small number of satellites that have been used for military purposes. A large portion of the country’s Geosynchronous Satellite (GSAT) communications constellation is used for military communications. GSAT-7 was the first ISRO satellite to provide services to the Indian military, largely to the Indian navy to enable communications between air, land, submarine, and warship systems. Similarly, GSAT-7A provides communication services to the Indian air force and army. The country’s first electronic intelligence satellite, EMISAT, is in orbit and is operated by the DRDO. India’s first all-weather radar-imaging satellite, Risat-2, successfully monitored border and maritime activity for the government and re-entered Earth’s atmosphere in 2022 after a 13-year mission. One of India’s most notable satellites, Microsat-R, was operated by the DRDO as an imaging satellite and used as a target for the 2019 destructive ASAT test. Additional reports indicate that India has been investing in the development of military intelligence satellites, specifically focusing on the contested China-India border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;counterspace-assessment-overview-2&quot;&gt;COUNTERSPACE ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s rise in the space domain is largely due to its demonstrated kinetic direct-ascent ASAT capability launched in 2019. Soon after the test, DRDO officials did not announce specific plans for another ASAT test in LEO but did indicate a possibility of testing in a higher orbit. The possibility of another ASAT test can be seen in research debates across the country. Despite continuing to invest in government and private industry capabilities, there were few public reports of counterspace developments in 2022. The DRDO has sectors focused on the development and design of “electronic, electro-optical and laser based sensors and systems,” though there are no public reports that non-kinetic counterspace capabilities have been developed. It does not appear that India targets space systems in its electronic or cyber systems. India continues to place an emphasis on encouraging developments in the commercial sector to increase its share of the global space economy, boost its domestic technology and industrial sectors, and increase its international standing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iran&quot;&gt;IRAN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Iran became the ninth country to successfully place a satellite into orbit using indigenous technologies. Since then, Iran’s space program has become one of the largest in the Middle East, and the country’s leaders regularly invoke the program as a symbol of national strength and progress. However, other countries insist that Iran’s civil and military space programs are cover for Tehran to circumvent international sanctions and develop an offensive ballistic missile and nuclear program. Iran publicly denies any interest in pursuing a nuclear ballistic missile program, claiming its right to pursue a peaceful space program under state sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-organization-3&quot;&gt;SPACE ORGANIZATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran’s space sector primarily falls under two primary organizations, the civilian Iranian Space Agency (ISA), founded in 2003, and the military Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Aerospace Force. While the two are technically separate, they share significant overlap in terms of authority and agenda. The ISA falls under the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology and operates with a Supreme Space Council, which sets policy and is chaired by the Iranian president. The Ministry of Defense is also involved in ISA operations, as its subsidiary groups develop the majority of SLV components and build the satellites. The IRGC is not subject to the policy of the Supreme Space Council and has traditionally focused on developing solid-fuel rockets — not typically used for modern SLVs but well suited for missiles — which has only increased suspicions about the intent of the IRGC’s space program. Due to international sanctions against supplying ballistic missile technology to the Iranian government, Iran’s private sector has been used as a front to circumvent sanctions and acquire space launch technology. These companies, like the Iranian government, often lack transparency and accountability, and many could likely be considered state-owned enterprises rather than independent businesses contracted by the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early months of 2023 have also seen an uptick of discussion about space in Tehran, with the announcement of a 10-year strategic plan for space released by the ISA in collaboration with the Secretariat of the Supreme Space Council. This document outlines a future where Iran is a regional leader in space technologies and space launch services by 2033. The plan has been applauded by the Iranian president, who added a goal for Iranian-built satellites to orbit in GEO and for independent broadcasting capabilities to be secured. This continues previously stated goals for the burgeoning space program, which included routinely launching satellites into LEO, attaining access to GEO by 2026, and sending an Iranian astronaut to space aboard an Iranian SLV by 2032.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-launch-capabilities-3&quot;&gt;SPACE LAUNCH CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Iran launched two satellites into orbit and had multiple successful tests of new SLVs. This brings the total of Iranian SLVs to five, to include the Safir, Simorgh, Qased, Zuljanah, and Ghaem. Of the five, three are operated by the ISA and two by the IRGC. The ISA operates the Safir, Simorgh, and Zuljanah. On February 9, 2009, the Safir became Iran’s first SLV to place objects into LEO, featuring a launch range of 300 to 350 kilometers. This success was followed by the Simorgh, with an extended launch range of up to 500 kilometers. After several failed attempts, the Simorgh was successful at placing objects in orbit in 2021. Among other similarities, both SLVs use liquid-fueled engines from the Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic missile. The Zuljanah, which has a hybrid design incorporating solid- and liquid-fuel stages and aims to deliver payloads of 220 kilogram to a 500 km orbit, was successfully tested for a second time in the summer of 2022. However, Iranian SLV progress also saw setbacks, such as the reported explosion of an unspecified SLV on a launchpad in March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Qased rocket was the first SLV operated solely by the IRGC and had a successful maiden flight in 2020 to launch Iran’s first military satellite, Noor-1. It was subsequently used to launch the Noor-2 in March 2022. In November 2022, the IRGC also tested a new three-stage solid-fuel launch vehicle, the Ghaem 100, which is designed to reach orbits of 500 kilometers and borrows heavily from the Qased. The Ghaem 100 vehicle is contracted to launch Nahid communication satellites into LEO, potentially in the first six months of 2023. Iran’s SLV and ballistic missile technology is heavily influenced by or acquired from other nations, particularly Russia and North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in October 2022, a third-stage capability, called Saman-1, was tested, which would allow a satellite to change orbits more quickly. This was tested by the Space Research Center and launched by Iran’s defense ministry, with additional interest from the ISA, which indicates that the technology is likely to be used by both the IRGC and the ISA when fully developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran operates two primary launch sites: the Shahrud Missile Test Site and the Imam Khomeini Space Center. The Shahrud Missile Test Site is located over 400 kilometers east of Tehran and is the predominant launch site of the ISA. The site was built in the 1980s with both Chinese and North Korean assistance. Construction of the Imam Khomeini Space Center, 50 kilometers southeast of Semnan, was completed in 2008 and inaugurated with the launch of a Shahab rocket. Following a destructive rocket launch failure in 2012 and significant construction, the center reopened its doors on July 27, 2017, with the successful launch of a Simorgh SLV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Iran continues to launch satellites from the Russian-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. In August 2022, a Russian rocket launched a remote-sensing Khayyam satellite, which, according to Iran’s information and communications technology minister, Issa Zarepour, was the beginning “of a strategic cooperation between Iran and Russia in the space industry.” The ISA claims that the satellite will send encrypted data to Iranian operators and that Russia will not have access to its data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;satellite-capabilities-3&quot;&gt;SATELLITE CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran currently has three satellites in orbit: the country’s first military satellite, Noor, launched in 2020; Noor-2, a military reconnaissance satellite launched into LEO in March 2022; and the Khayyam Earth-imaging satellite, built and launched by Russia in August 2022. Both Noor satellites collect ISR data, and Iranian officials have released color photographs that the Noor-2 satellite took of U.S. military bases in Bahrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, the ISA head announced a new telecommunication satellite system, named after former IRGC commander Qassem Soleimani, which is cited as a fundamental element of the 10-year plan for space. Additionally, an Iranian state-run news agency has reported that Iran is capable of building indigenous remote-sensing satellites able to capture images with a resolution of 5 to 10 meters. This capability has not been verified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran is developing other space capabilities as well and is strengthening relationships with other space-faring nations, particularly Russia. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 solidified a military alliance between Iran and Russia, and there are reports that Iran is now Russia’s top military supplier. In exchange for Iran’s support, particularly through the supply of UAVs, Russia is likely returning the favor with military and technical support to Iran. Further, in December 2022, the ISA and Roscosmos signed an agreement to design and build remote sensing and communication satellites, develop infrastructure, and hold joint training, which may bolster Iran’s space capabilities in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;counterspace-assessment-overview-3&quot;&gt;COUNTERSPACE ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a series of launch failures in recent years, Iran showed signs of progress in 2022. Though Tehran’s launch and satellite capabilities are nowhere near robust, there seems to have been a significant shift in mission success and overall government support of space capabilities. However, Iran appears far from developing kinetic ASAT weapons or non-kinetic physical counterspace weapons. The country continues to develop electronic and cyber capabilities, where Iran has shown success in jamming and hacking against foreign government and commercial satellite communications and the GPS network for years. During periods of civil unrest in the country in 2022, the Iranian government blocked access in Iran to a wide variety of cellular and internet networks, including SpaceX’s Starlink website homepage. Most notably in the last year, French satellite operator Eutelsat revealed details of signals jamming originating in Iran on two of its satellites in the fall of 2022, affecting Persian TV and radio transmissions. The operator notified relevant authorities in Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN MISSION SUCCESS AND OVERALL GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OF SPACE CAPABILITIES.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;north-korea&quot;&gt;NORTH KOREA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Koreas space capabilities are shrouded in uncertainty. It has been just over a decade since the first successful launch of a North Korean satellite in December 2012, and the country’s space program has since experienced only limited progress. However, 2022 saw an uptick in space activity, including two potential technology tests of components for a future national reconnaissance satellite and upgrades to a space launch facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-organization-4&quot;&gt;SPACE ORGANIZATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s space activities are centralized under the National Aerospace Development Administration (NADA), which has the stated mission of space development for peaceful purposes, though these claims are often refuted. NADA’s acronym and the organization’s logo resemble the U.S. civil space organization, NASA. NADA was established after the 2013 meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, which adopted a law on space development. This law was revised at a 2022 meeting of the Standing Committee of the 14th Supreme People’s Assembly. State media described the revision as creating basic principles and norms “to ensure space development activities legally and more firmly (sic).” Further details have not been released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-launch-capabilities-4&quot;&gt;SPACE LAUNCH CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, North Korea tested more missiles than any year previously. The country launched over 90 missiles in 2022, including 23 on a single day, November 2, 2022, some within 60 kilometers of the coast of South Korea. Historically, the country’s missile activity has not translated to success for its space program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea reported a space launch test on February 26, 2022, for a spy satellite, a statement the U.S. Department of Defense has refuted as a disguise for an intercontinental ballistic missile system. However, the claim remains consistent with a confirmed “test-piece satellite” launched in December 2022 at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station. Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un visited the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in March 2022 to inspect the spaceport and NADA’s upcoming projects, as well as oversee plans for significant upgrades to the launch site. In December 2022, a new horizontal engine test stand was built and used to conduct its first test, with Kim Jongun in attendance. North Korea’s second launch site, the Tonghae Satellite Launching Ground, has seen routine maintenance in the last decade but is possibly inactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s most consistent SLV is the Unha, which has four variants and borrows engine designs from the country’s Nodong medium-range ballistic missile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;satellite-capabilities-4&quot;&gt;SATELLITE CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has successfully launched only two Earth observation satellites into orbit, the first in 2012 and another in 2016. After years of failed tests and launches, NADA completed a successful on-orbit “final-stage test” of a military reconnaissance test satellite on December 18, 2022. Ahead of North Korea’s planned first launch of an operational military reconnaissance satellite in April 2023, this technology demonstrator satellite proved camera operability, communication transmission capabilities, and the accuracy of tracking from a ground control system. The test satellite reportedly reached a 500 km orbit with a camera that captured images at 20 m resolution as well as video. Black and white images of Seoul were released by North Korea’s official newspaper, Rodong Sinmum, that were reportedly taken by the test satellite. While not an exquisite system, this rudimentary system would improve North Korea’s limited space capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;counterspace-assessment-overview-4&quot;&gt;COUNTERSPACE ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has demonstrated small successes in its space program over the past year, most notably receiving imagery from a test reconnaissance satellite, but this has been overshadowed by the immense number of missile launches conducted in 2022. While a robust missile launching capability may benefit Pyongyang’s space launch programs, North Korea has yet to exhibit the necessary sensing and altitude control capabilities for a direct-ascent ASAT weapon. It also remains unlikely that North Korea is actively pursuing any non-kinetic physical capabilities. The country has, however, demonstrated successful electronic warfare through GPS and other jamming. North Korea’s cyberattack threat is active and viable, though it is most often used for economic or political messaging rather than aimed at space assets. As the country acquires more advanced technologies, likely through illicit means, and gains operating experience, threats to space systems and ground stations may grow more credible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NORTH KOREA HAS DEMONSTRATED SMALL SUCCESSES IN ITS SPACE PROGRAM OVER THE PAST YEAR . . . BUT THIS HAS BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY THE IMMENSE NUMBER OF MISSILE LAUNCHES CONDUCTED IN 2022.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;others&quot;&gt;OTHERS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the previous chapters have been dedicated to analyzing the countries making the largest strides in counterspace capabilities, they are not the only ones thinking strategically about the changing space environment. This chapter includes discussion and developments related to counterspace capabilities by other countries and non-state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;australia&quot;&gt;AUSTRALIA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defence Space Command of the Royal Australian Air Force was formally established on January 18, 2022, bringing the space elements across the Australian military services into one integrated headquarters organization (similar to the U.S. Space Force). Shortly after, the Australian government released a Defence Space Strategy to build upon the 2020 Defence Strategic Update, declaring the mission is “to prepare space power to secure Australia’s interests in peace and war.” Additionally, the Space Surveillance Telescope (SST), built by the United States and jointly operated with Australia, became operational in September 2022. The SST will provide more accurate space domain awareness by providing tracking and detection of even “faint objects in deep space.” These space domain awareness capabilities are critical to observing and clarifying many space and counterspace activities outlined in this report, including space launch, RPOs, and ASAT missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;france&quot;&gt;FRANCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French officials have continued to be outspoken about investing in counterspace technologies. To spur greater space advancements, Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne announced in September 2022 that the country would be injecting €9.0 billion ($9.6 billion) into the space sector in the next three years. This includes at least €1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) to the country’s civil space agency, the National Centre for Space Studies (CNES). In the same speech, Prime Minister Borne reiterated France’s military space ambitions, largely concentrated on maintaining strategic autonomy in the space domain, including the development of active defenses for space objects. In February 2022, France held its annual space wargame, AsterX, to put elements of the French space defense strategy into practice. Participants from nearly 30 countries were in attendance, spanning military and industry partners. The growth of AsterX emphasizes France’s ambitions as a leader in the military space domain and its intention to grow its defensive counterspace capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After initially publicly discussing the idea of bodyguard satellites in 2019, France is well underway to achieving this capability to protect assets in GEO with a satellite named YODA. Publicly available information states that YODA will have an ISR capability to detect incoming threats to GEO satellites. The first contract for YODA was awarded to Hemeria, a French space start-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;israel&quot;&gt;ISRAEL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As reported in previous years, Israel continues to make progress in testing its Iron Beam capability, a directed-energy system that will complement the Iron Dome missile defense system. This electronic warfare weapon is currently being designed for UAVs and missiles, but with technological changes such as increased power and targeting, it could evolve into a counterspace capability. However, there are no current reports of Israeli leadership steering technology development for Iron Beam in that direction. In April 2022, defense contractor Rafael relayed that the project received renewed funding from the Israeli Defense Forces after successful live-fire tests. Israeli representatives indicated that the Iron Beam could be operational in as few as two to three years. This will be a permanent ground-based system capable of destroying or disabling targets several kilometers away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japan&quot;&gt;JAPAN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2022, Japan released a new national security strategy, national defense strategy, and national defense buildup program, which all emphasize the importance of capabilities in the space domain. These documents add policy positions to an approved 2022 defense budget which dedicated ¥79 billion ($588 million) to capabilities in the space domain, excluding funds tied to ballistic missile defenses. Enhancement of space situational awareness (SSA) capabilities is high on the defense spending list, including development of an on-orbit optical telescope capability, the “procurement of SSA laser ranging equipment” to monitor objects in LEO, interoperability with domestic organizations and the U.S. military, and enhanced satellite communications systems. The 2022 budget document also outlines a reorganization of the Space Operations Squadron, to be broken up into a first squadron to focus on SSA monitoring, a second squadron to focus on the detection of jamming against Japanese satellites, and a third squadron designated as a Space System Management Squadron to manage and maintain space equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, Japan launched another satellite for its Intelligence Gathering Satellite (IGS) constellation. The IGS-Radar 7 launched from Japan’s Tanegashima Space Center, located on the island of Tanegashima about 40 kilometers south of Kyushu. IGS-Radar satellites are operated by the Cabinet Satellite Information Center, and data is utilized both for national security purposes and civil natural disaster monitoring. This followed a disappointing launch year for the country, in which its only orbital launch attempt in October 2022 failed to reach orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;south-korea&quot;&gt;SOUTH KOREA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s space program reached a major milestone in June 2022 when the country had its first successful satellite launch using an indigenous liquid-fueled rocket called Nuri. Nuri launched four small satellites to be used for several missions, including Earth observation. This makes South Korea only the tenth nation to successfully build and launch a rocket. In late 2022, the country’s defense ministry tested a solid-fueled rocket as part of efforts to bolster its defense posture and to launch space-based reconnaissance satellites. Officials, including the newly elected president and science minister, have spoken about commitments to increase the country’s space capabilities, including establishing a state aerospace agency in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;united-kingdom&quot;&gt;UNITED KINGDOM&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the 2021 establishment of UK Space Command, the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence released a Defence Space Strategy in February 2022 focused on operationalizing the space domain. This document serves as a follow-on to the 2021 National Space Strategy and outlines an increase in investment for the UK space sector, injecting an additional £1.4 billion ($1.7 billion) into space systems. This is in addition to £5.0 billion ($6.0 billion) committed to a next-generation military satellite communications constellation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;non-state-actors&quot;&gt;NON-STATE ACTORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 1, 2022, unconfirmed reports surfaced that non-state actors affiliated with Anonymous — a decentralized international activist and “hacktivist” collective — hacked their way into Roscosmos’ satellite control center. This instance was one of many “hacktivist” activities against Russia after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Dmitry Rogozin, head of Roscosmos at the time, announced that all Roscosmos control centers were operational and that these claims were false. Another hacktivist targeted the Russian Space Research Institute website, leaving crude comments on webpages and threatening further action if Russia did not leave Ukraine. This hacktivist also claimed to be part of Anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-watch&quot;&gt;WHAT TO WATCH&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another year has passed where predictions from previous Space Threat Assessments have been realized. The 2022 report predicted the trend in electronic warfare that “the denial of GPS or satellite communications can have a great effect.” This year, while electronic warfare weapons were used on the battlefield in Ukraine, employed early and throughout the war by Russia, the “great effects” that may have been envisioned prior have not been realized. Notably, jamming of GPS and satellite communications did not directly trigger an escalation of the conflict. Past iterations of the report also detailed extensive Chinese counterspace developments. Despite the U.S. Department of Defense characterizing China as the “pacing threat,” Beijing was relatively quiet on the counterspace front this year. This could be for a variety of reasons, but China’s lack of visible activity should not be construed as a decrease in the threat assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 edition noted a growing number of countries expanding their focus on military operations in the space domain, reorganizing their national security space enterprises, and discussing how to defend space assets, including in cooperation with allies and partners. This trend continues, with examples such as Australia establishing a Defence Space Command in January 2022 and Japan and the United States affirming that attacks “to, from or within space present a clear challenge to the security of the Alliance” and “could lead to the invocation of Article V of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;china-1&quot;&gt;CHINA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it has been a busy year tracking Russian counterspace activities, China has been relatively quiet. This is in contrast to previous years when Beijing conducted provocative, and detectable, space demonstrations such as the hypersonic fractional orbital bombardment system test and SJ-21 RPOs, as highlighted in last year’s report. What explains this decrease in activity? The authors acknowledge that, as open-source researchers, they are limited to publicly available information. However, more commercial and publicly available sources of relevant information, such as satellite telemetry data, jamming detection, satellite imagery, and translated Chinese documents, are aiding in such independent analysis. It may be that certain counterspace weapons programs have achieved their testing objectives with no need for further testing at this time; that these systems have shifted from development and test to production and fielding; or that they continue to be tested but in an undetectable manner or only detectable with classified U.S. sensors. It may also be the case that Beijing is focusing its resources on other parts of its national security space enterprise or military modernization efforts “to become the world’s leading power.” This lack of activity does not put the authors at ease, who will be closely watching Beijing actions, nor U.S. senior officials, who continue to emphasize that China remains the “most challenging threat,” followed by Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report traditionally describes weapons that pose threats to U.S. space assets. However, U.S. policymakers and military leaders are increasingly being confronted with the threat of how adversary space capabilities (e.g., ISR, communications, and PNT) can be used to target joint and coalition forces on the ground, in air, and at sea. For example, China’s fleet of ISR satellites is “more than 250 systems — a quantity second only to the United States.” Last year, Beijing appears to have launched four sets each of Yaogan-35 and Yaogan-36 “triplet satellites” (24 total satellites), which are believed to comprise a military surveillance system incorporating Earth observation, synthetic aperture radar, and electronic intelligence capabilities. Coupling its growth in space-based ISR with advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation, Beijing is developing, across multiple modalities, an ability to rapidly detect targets and relay those target coordinates to its precision weapon systems to close its own kill chains. The authors anticipate greater public discussions, especially by U.S. national security space leaders, on the policy, capability investments, and operational concepts needed to deny others the use of space against U.S. forces and interests (i.e., U.S. counterspace weapons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-from-russias-invasion-of-ukraine&quot;&gt;LESSONS FROM RUSSIA’S INVASION OF UKRAINE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous iterations of this report highlighted Russia’s advanced jamming, dazzling, and cyber capabilities. However, few of these more advanced non-kinetic weapons have been seen in Ukraine, despite social media videos and tweets purporting to show such systems in operation, such as the Krasukha-4 electronic warfare counterspace weapon. Nevertheless, many experts have been surprised at Russia’s lack of success with its electronic warfare systems. Also absent from the war are laser systems, such as the Peresvet and Sokol-Eshelon, and SAR jamming systems to counter ISR satellites despite the heavy and public use of imagery satellites to track Russian forces. There are several reasons why Russia has not employed such counterspace systems, to the extent such employment would be covered in open-source reporting. It may be that if any attacks were occurring, commercial space companies and Western governments may not want the success of such attacks publicly disclosed. This could be to avoid giving Russia a battle damage assessment and encouragement to use such counterspace weapons against other targets, or to avoid rattling other customers or investors and eroding any competitive advantages. Another possibility is that these Russian systems are not as effective as Western researchers predicted pre-invasion, whether because the attacks are not as damaging as assumed or that companies, as with SpaceX, have found effective work-arounds to continue operations. It is possible that these systems are inoperable or not as widely deployed as previously assumed. Finally, it could also be that these systems are held in reserve, perhaps viewed as more escalatory or to be used for more strategic purposes. Such use and non-use of different counterspace weapons in Ukraine may be instructive as analysts seek to better understand Moscow’s space strategy and doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed throughout this report, commercial data and communications services have been integral to Ukraine’s resistance. The former chairman of the State Space Agency of Ukraine, Volodymyr Usov, stated at a December 2022 conference that almost 50 percent of intelligence supplied to Ukraine came from the commercial space industry. Starlink has been called a “lifeline” for Ukrainian forces and civilians alike. Therefore, it is not surprising that Russia targeted and attacked commercial space systems — first Viasat and then SpaceX’s Starlink. As the commercial space sector continues to show its utility in peacetime and conflict for governments and their militaries, the United States’ role in protecting commercial capabilities and strategies for how to do so will be key policy issues for the U.S. government. For starters, commercial operators will increasingly seek threat information from the government that would allow them to make informed decisions on how to better protect constellations or prepare procedures to respond to attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s resistance against Russia is nothing short of remarkable. As researchers who specifically focus on contributions from the space domain to Ukraine’s resistance, the authors ponder how space capabilities can enable David to beat Goliath. Will smaller nations invest in space capabilities to bolster their national security and resilience if attacked, especially by a more powerful nation? Ukraine’s resistance has demonstrated that space capabilities can create an advantage over a more capable military power. Should Taiwan pursue proliferated LEO communications and greater use of commercial ISR data? Conversely, the benefit that space capabilities provide in modern warfare may also provide the justification for adversaries to increase their counterspace weapons development and deny their opponents access to space during a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Starlink’s effectiveness in Ukraine has showcased the advantages of proliferated LEO (pLEO) constellations. As more commercial companies and militaries develop pLEO systems, adversaries will seek to counter them. Constellations with satellites in the hundreds and thousands may necessitate a shift in an adversary’s targeting calculus. Kinetic direct-ascent ASATs or kinetic co-orbital weapons that are designed to attack single satellites are less effective unless employed en masse. Moreover, kinetic attacks run the risk of generating a cascading debris field that would make orbits unusable, including for an adversary’s own constellations. An adversary’s options are likely to shift toward cyberattacks, debris-generating attacks to collapse an entire orbital plane, high-altitude nuclear detonations (HANDs), or attacks on physical infrastructure like ground stations. Indicators for such a shif could include research to understand the effects of HANDs on satellites, for example, as Chinese scientists are reportedly doing at a PLA research institute. Each of these variants of counterspace weapons has policy, operational, and technical trade-offs, and some would be highly escalatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UKRAINE’S RESISTANCE HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT SPACE CAPABILITIES CAN CREATE AN ADVANTAGE OVER A MORE CAPABLE MILITARY POWER.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-situational-awareness&quot;&gt;SPACE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An indicator not addressed in detail in this report is the need for robust space situational awareness (SSA) to enable counterspace weapons targeting. SSA refers to the ability to identify, characterize, and track space objects, where collecting accurate and actionable data is incredibly challenging. Exquisite SSA data is not only advantageous for on-orbit operations of national and commercial satellites but also to provide accurate targeting for counterspace weapons. In order to attack a satellite on-orbit, an aggressor would need to know its precise location and where it is moving. The aggressor will also want accurate battle damage assessments. For example, if a satellite is targeted through a cyberattack that allows the attacker to disable its controls, SSA will be necessary to determine if the attack was successful by monitoring the satellite and any controlled movements. Although this report tracks counterspace weapons developments, it is important to acknowledge the critical data needed to deploy many of these counterspace weapons against targets. Countries that are investing in SSA are not necessarily also developing counterspace weapons; however, countries that are both investing in SSA capabilities and developing counterspace weapons should be watched carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;direct-ascent-asat-test-ban&quot;&gt;DIRECT-ASCENT ASAT TEST BAN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 18, 2022, U.S. vice president Kamala Harris announced a U.S. commitment to stopping destructive direct-ascent ASAT missile testing, an important step forward for sustainability and stability in space. Since then, nine other countries have committed not to conduct destructive direct-ascent ASAT tests, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, a resolution in the United Nations was adopted on December 7, 2022, that “calls upon all States to commit not to conduct destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite missile tests.” This resolution was passed, with 155 countries voting in support, 9 voting against, and 9 abstaining. Notably, China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and India did not vote in favor of the resolution. This response to the United States’ unilateral commitment may indicate greater international motivation to develop sustainable norms, behaviors, and agreements to limit the use or testing of counterspace weapons, especially those that create long-lasting orbital debris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past year offered a tangible reminder of how important and integral space capabilities have become to citizens across the globe, not only in peacetime but through crisis and conflict. In Ukraine, space capabilities offered: (1) transparency on military aggression by showing the world the buildup and movement of Russian forces; (2) connectivity by enabling Ukrainian forces to transmit information across the battlefield; and (3) a lifeline to the outside world by allowing the Ukrainian people to connect with the world and expose the horrors of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the advantages that space capabilities provide make them a target. The past year showed unusual and threatening behaviors from LEO to GEO, demonstrating that no orbital regime is out of reach of counterspace weapons. It also showed how counterspace weapons have become part of a broader tool kit and military campaign to disrupt command, control, communications, and intelligence gathering and to degrade the effectiveness of UAVs and precision munitions. As China and Russia put more counterspace weapons into operational units, such integration of counterspace weapons and tactics with broader military plans will only increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s rapid growth in its space capabilities across the PLA’s Strategic Support Force, state-owned enterprises, and burgeoning commercial sector means that it now has a lot to lose. It has quickly become the number two space power, displacing Russia, whose space program is atrophying. CSIS has previously written that “deterrence succeeds by altering the cost-benefit calculus of a potential aggressor.” Beijing’s calculus now involves a high cost, which may give it pause. Moscow’s does not. Notably, no ASAT tests occurred in the past year. Perhaps this is a result of the greater recognition of the destructive potential of debris-generating activity in space, which can ruin orbits for oneself and all others dependent on space, or perhaps it is a result of international efforts in 2022 on norms of behavior and safety and sustainability in space, or it may just be a matter of time before the technology is tested once again. In 2023, it will be important to monitor if this consequential trend is sustained.&lt;/p&gt;

It also looks at the key foreign components, restricted by the allied export control measures, needed to produce high-end Russian defense technology, such as optical systems, bearings, machine tools, engines, and microchips. The report then examines the Kremlin’s efforts to mitigate the ramifications of the international sanctions regime through methods such as import substitution and sanctions-evasion techniques.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report finds that sanctions create shortages of higher-end foreign components and force Moscow to substitute them with lower-quality alternatives. For now, Moscow’s efforts at state-backed import substitution remain largely unsuccessful. This ultimately impacts Russia’s ability to manufacture, sustain, and deliver advanced weapons and technology to the battlefield in Ukraine. Therefore, while the quality of the military equipment used by the Ukrainian army continues to improve thanks to the Western aid, the quality of Russia’s weapons continues to degrade. At the same time, the Kremlin still possesses a significant degree of adaptability to Western sanctions, taking advantage of its prewar stockpiles of older equipment, as well as countries willing to supply Moscow with restricted dual-use items and technology via a web of illicit supply chains. Considering Russia’s existing capabilities and limitations, it will likely opt for a slower-paced attritional campaign in Ukraine, putting pressure on Kyiv and its Western partners, but thereby further stressing its military and industrial base already stretched thin by sanctions and the last 12 months of the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the United States — along with its allies and partners — introduced an unprecedented set of sanctions and export-control restrictions targeting Russia’s military industrial complex, placing Russian and Belarusian firms operating “in the defense and related materiel, aerospace, electronics, marine, or technology sectors” on the sanctioned entity list. This restricted the flow of sensitive dual-use U.S.-origin technology and software, as well as foreign technology and software made using U.S.-origin products, to the sanctioned companies. Many allied nations in Europe and East Asia, from which Russia would typically purchase such items, have issued similar directives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of these measures, Moscow has reportedly faced challenges accessing the foreign-made components necessary to produce and sustain a range of weapons systems, from missiles to tanks and aircraft. Western officials have struck an optimistic tone, with U.S. secretary of commerce Gina Raimondo remarking in April 2022, “The Russian military is struggling to find spare parts for their tanks, for their satellites, for their rocket-mounting systems,” adding that the international sanctions regime had blocked Russian access to “almost all semiconductors, night-vision goggles, avionics.” Similarly, in February 2023, U.S. deputy secretary of the treasury Wally Adeyemo declared, “Today, Russia can’t produce enough arms to meet their basic needs,” and described the Russian economy as “nothing like the Russian economy you saw before the invasion.” Yet despite these statements, multiple indicators suggest that the Kremlin has created new ways to circumvent export-control restrictions and secure much-needed foreign components to sustain and produce its weapons systems and wage war on Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report examines the practical ramifications of Western sanctions on Russia’s military industrial base to date and the Kremlin’s ability to overcome them. It does so by analyzing Russia’s defense production capabilities and limitations, including the specific military equipment and technology that Moscow may be able to replace domestically or will struggle to produce going forward, as well as defense capabilities the Kremlin is prioritizing one year into the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unprecedented sanctions and export controls are no doubt having a negative effect on Russia’s industrial complex. Moscow is under pressure to adapt, often turning to less-reliable and costlier suppliers and supply routes, lower-quality imports, or trying to reproduce Western components internally. This is likely hampering the rate and quality of Russian defense production. Nevertheless, available evidence indicates that the Kremlin will still be able to maintain its war efforts in Ukraine. Sanctions and export controls are not a silver bullet that will force Russia to bring the war to an end. Russia’s large prewar equipment stockpiles, its massive military industrial complex, and the prioritization of defense production (especially for parts and components also used in civilian industrial sectors) as part of Moscow’s wartime mobilization are likely to enable the Kremlin to continue to wage war in Ukraine, albeit with limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that sanctions and export controls are not having a battlefield impact. The quality of the Russian military in terms of advanced equipment will likely decline, at least over the near term. Russia’s ability to conduct offensive operations that require precision and coordination may be further limited, leading Moscow to rely on potential manpower advantages. Meanwhile, if Western aid continues, the equipment used by the Ukrainian army may continue to improve. Thus, the quality of military equipment used by the Ukrainian and Russian militaries are currently going in opposite directions — and as quality suffers, so will Moscow’s ability to match the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) conventionally or maintain a vibrant high-end export market for its defense systems. Sanctions and export controls are therefore having an important impact on Russia’s military, which will be felt on the battlefield and into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expounding upon these points, this report first examines the ability of the Russian defense sector to field the core weapons and systems that make up its war machine. More specifically, it analyzes Moscow’s supply and production of tanks, missiles, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), aircraft, and electronic warfare (EW) systems. Next, the report looks at the impact of sanctions on the Russian procurement capacity of key foreign components needed to produce high-end defense technology, from advanced tanks to EW devices. These components include optical systems, bearings, machine tools, engines, and microchips. The paper then turns to the Kremlin’s efforts to adapt to the international sanctions regime through methods such as import substitution and sanctions-evasion techniques like illicit trade via land corridors. Finally, the report presents concluding assessments of the impact of international sanctions on the Russian war effort in Ukraine, before outlining a list of recommendations to Western policymakers working to tighten the sanctions net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-capacity-to-deliver-key-military-equipment-and-technology&quot;&gt;Russia’s Capacity to Deliver Key Military Equipment and Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the 2022 invasion, Russia’s Ministry of Defense has classified all information on military equipment and technologies lost in Ukraine. Yet reliable estimates exist from Oryx, a Dutch open-source intelligence website, which lists destroyed, damaged, abandoned, and captured Russian weapons systems. Oryx only documents losses for which there is visual proof, meaning that its accounting likely represents the lower bound for equipment losses, as there are inevitably battlefield losses without any publicly available corroborating visual evidence. Based on this list, one year into the war, Moscow is no longer in possession of more than 9,700 pieces of military equipment and technology. In addition to Oryx, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (ZSU) also releases data on Russian equipment losses through daily reports, claiming that Russian losses are at least twice as high as Oryx estimates (see Table 1). While the ZSU has access to significantly more information than open-source analysis does, there may also be incentives for Kyiv to over-report battlefield successes. The CSIS research team therefore views these numbers as lower and upper bounds documenting the lost Russian weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aMLm5rj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Oryx vs. ZSU Data Showcasing Russian Equipment Losses as of March 18, 2023.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: ZSU data was acquired from the Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) official Twitter account; Oryx data was acquired from the Oryx website. * These estimates will most likely be higher by the time this report is published, as Russia continues to experience daily vehicle, weapons, and manpower losses in Ukraine. ** The CSIS research team believes that the stark difference in the UAV data has to do with the chosen methodologies. The Oryx investigators count the losses of military UAVs, including the Orlan-10 and Eleron-3, while the Ukrainian side counts losses of all types of UAVs, including commercial drones and quadcopters purchased by Russia from third countries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the conflicting data, the levels of equipment losses experienced in Ukraine are clearly unprecedented for post-Soviet Russia, and much higher than the Kremlin’s total equipment losses recorded during the first (1994–1996) and second (1999–2000) Chechen wars and in the 2008 Russo-Georgian war.9 But Russia’s military capabilities still greatly outnumber those of Ukraine on most indicators, including man-, air-, land, and naval power. While an accurate count of Moscow’s current military stocks is not available publicly, it has been roughly estimated that, as of February 2023, the total number of aircraft at the Kremlin’s disposal has been 13–15 times more than Kyiv’s. Russia has nearly 7–8 times more tanks and 4 times more armored fighting vehicles, while its naval fleet is 12–16 times larger than Ukraine’s. Yet many Russian stockpiled munitions are also older and of lesser quality, with many also requiring refurbishment before they are battle ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, although Russia retains a formidable arsenal numerically, it is nonetheless important to evaluate its current capacity to deliver key military equipment and technologies to the battlefield in Ukraine. This, in turn, will aid a broader analysis of Moscow’s sanctions-affected defense production capabilities. While Russia relies on a wide range of conventional munitions in Ukraine, the authors of this report have examined the following five weapons systems and technologies widely regarded as crucial to Moscow’s war effort: tanks, missiles, UAVs, aircraft, and EW technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tanks&quot;&gt;TANKS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armor, especially main battle tanks (MBTs), remains one of the chief strengths of Russia’s defense industry. Moscow is estimated to have lost anywhere from 1,845 to 3,511 tanks one year into the war — but is thought to hold around 5,000 old tanks in reserve. Recent reports claim that Moscow has experienced particularly heavy losses of its modern T-72B3 MBT — which was delivered in 2013 as an upgraded version of the T-72B MBT. This has ultimately forced Russia to bring older tanks, manufactured several years and sometimes decades prior to the start of Russia’s military modernization program in 2011, into service as replacements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the rather rare appearance of more advanced equipment such as the T-90A and T-90M third-generation MBTs or the modernized T-80BVM MBT may suggest that they have been intentionally kept off the front lines. In 2020, reliable Russian-language military sources indicated that around 700 T-90 and T-80 MBTs and up to 2,000 mainline T-72 MBT variants were held in Russian military service. By that time, Russia was also estimated to have had 200 T-90, 3,000 T-80, and 7,000 T-72 MBTs in storage — along with thousands of older T-54/T-55/T-62 tanks. As mentioned above, many of these older tanks, including the T-54s and T-55s, have been taken out of storage and sent to the front in Ukraine to supplement earlier losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KFhsrKv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;An abandoned Russian T-72 tank in eastern Ukraine in September 2022.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence also suggests that the demand on modern MBTs outstrips the current production rate. For instance, Russian liberal media has reported that UralVagonZavod, a Russian plant producing tanks, can only make 20 tanks per month. By contrast, Russia has lost at least 148 tanks each month, based on Oryx estimates. Recently, deputy head of the Russian security council Dmitry Medvedev has claimed that the Russian military industrial complex will produce 1,500 modern MBTs in 2023 — a statement that independent Russian military experts have assessed as “absolutely impossible.” Some have also suggested that, while it is unlikely that the Kremlin will manufacture 1,500 completely new MBTs, instead Moscow may largely modernize its Soviet-era tanks, equipping them with new communications systems, electronics, and other components. According to a source close to the Russian Ministry of Defense, even though the ministry plans to produce several hundred new T-90M and T-14 MBTs, it will allegedly mostly upgrade its T-80, T-72, and older T-62 tanks. Therefore, while the Russian military industrial complex may struggle to roll out new MBTs, its domestic defense enterprises might be adapting to the challenges brought about by sanctions by repurposing older equipment for tanks and other armored vehicles. This may enable them to resurrect around 90 older MBTs per month, by some accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, even though Russia has lost a sizable share of its prewar tank fleet — up to 40 percent, according to some estimates — it likely retains some of its post-2011 MBT stockpiles, as well as large amounts of the Cold War–era tanks and defense industrial capacity to repair and modernize this equipment. Therefore, the Kremlin will likely be able to maintain the supply of tanks to its forces in Ukraine for some time. However, in the longer term, the allied export restrictions on certain key Western spare parts used in modern tank production — discussed in detail in the following section — may significantly degrade Moscow’s defense industrial capacity to manufacture advanced MBTs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;missiles&quot;&gt;MISSILES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missiles have played an important role in Moscow’s offensive military operations against Kyiv. While Russia has reportedly fired around 5,000 missiles and lost at least 139 missile systems within the past year (see Table 1), exact information about the Kremlin’s initial and remaining stockpiles is extremely difficult to ascertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 depicts the total weekly numbers of missiles that Russia used to strike military and civilian targets in Ukraine between late August 2022 and mid-March 2023. While patterns of greater strike frequency tend to follow periods of relative inactivity, it cannot be decisively concluded solely from this data that the Kremlin currently experiences serious issues with its missile stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KZzHQMT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Average Number of Missiles Russia Launched against Ukraine, August 2022 to March 2023.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Based on data compiled by the CSIS Europe, Russia, and Eurasia team with assistance from the Conflict Intelligence Team using open-source data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major issue for Ukraine is that while its air defense capabilities have expanded and improved, giving it an ability to defend against many types of Russian missiles, it does not have an ability to intercept some of Moscow’s newer and more advanced systems, including the hypersonic Kinzhal missiles, as well as older but repurposed munitions such as the S-300 missiles. For instance, during a March 9 missile barrage, Ukraine was only able to intercept 38 of the 81 missiles that Russia had fired. Kyiv is expected to receive the Patriot missile defense systems and the SAMP/T-MAMBA air defense system from its Western partners sometime in spring 2023, which should give it a greater ability to defend against Russian missiles. However, a critical question is how long Moscow can sustain its barrage of Ukrainian targets with more advanced missile systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also raises questions both about Russia’s ability to produce new missiles and its depth of stockpiles. According to James O’Brien, head of the office of sanctions coordination at the U.S. Department of State, Russia can currently make around 60 to 90 “missiles and strategic weapons” per month. Moscow does not provide such data, but it asserts that it has sufficient reserves of long-range precision munitions and that Russian factories are also currently producing more of these weapons, claims that are backed by some Western and Ukrainian sources. For instance, evidence documented by Conflict Armament Research (CAR) suggests that the two Kh-101 latest-generation air-to-surface long-range cruise missiles deployed by the Russian Armed Forces in a November 2022 attack in Ukraine had been almost certainly produced no more than two months before their use. More recently, Ukraine’s military intelligence has reported that Russia makes around 30 Kh-101s and 20 Kalibrs a month. Moscow’s ability to make advanced cruise missiles such as the Kh-101 and Kalibr could indicate that it has found ways to acquire foreign-produced microelements by circumventing existing export regulations — or that it accrued significant stockpiles of those components in the years preceding the 2022 invasion. If the latter stands true and foreign electronics used in Russian missiles today were purchased and stockpiled before February 2022, once this supply decreases due to the war and export controls, missile production will also be affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, some experts believe that there are already very visible signs of Moscow’s long-range precision-missile stocks decreasing, while their production rate may not be sufficient to enable Moscow to continue frequent missile strikes. In late November 2022, Ukrainian minister of defense Oleksii Reznikov stated that the Kremlin had lost around 24 percent of its ground-, sea-, and air-launched high-precision missiles. These numbers included reduced stocks of the Kalibr and Kh-101 inventories (around 37 percent and 50 percent of the initial stocks, respectively). More recent reports from the front also suggest that the Kremlin might be running out of its modern Iskander ballistic munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These stockpile losses might have diminished Russia’s ability to sustain the current rate of fire using modern precision-guided munitions, ultimately forcing Moscow to rely on its older and less accurate, yet more generous, missile arsenal and, in certain cases, draw on its stockpiles of nuclear delivery systems to sustain conventional missile strikes. For instance, Russia has repurposed its S-300 surface-to-air defense missiles to hit ground targets in Ukraine. While, as mentioned above, the S-300s are difficult to intercept, they are also less accurate, often exploding hundreds of yards from their initial targets. Moscow has also repurposed its anti-ship missiles like the Onyx to strike surface targets, as well as the older Kh-55 missiles — initially designed to carry nuclear warheads — allegedly to exhaust Kyiv’s air defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FF1yrPT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;A Russian S-300 missile system presented during the Victory Day parade on May 9, 2015.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though in a March 9 air strike Russian forces fired six new hypersonic Kinzhal missiles, resulting in a much higher than usual success rate, such powerful munitions have been very rarely used in Ukraine (usually, to hit targets of high importance such as the Ukrainian energy infrastructure). Kyiv claims Moscow to have no more than 50 Kinzhals in storage, which can explain why they are deployed at much lower rates in Ukraine. There is also a limit to how many prestige weapons systems Russia can expend in Ukraine without undermining its defense posture against NATO and other militarily advanced countries. To put Russia’s missile stockpiles in perspective, a recent RAND Corporation report found that building up large stockpiles of long-range precision-strike missiles was viewed by the Russian military as vital to deterring NATO. Using publicly available targeting information from Western campaigns and Russian theoretical writings, RAND estimated that large military areas, such as airfields, would need around 30–60 cruise missiles, and critical military facilities and complex air defense structures might require 75–100. Going forward, without an assured supply chain to manufacture more, the Kremlin might have to retain a large proportion of its already decreasing long-range precision munition stockpiles, ultimately restricting the ability of the Russian Armed Forces to frequently strike Ukraine with missiles in the coming months — leaving them to rely more on long-range drone strikes, as discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Russia is likely depleting its stockpile of advanced long-range precision munitions in Ukraine. However, it has demonstrated an ability to continue to manufacture new missiles, albeit at a slower pace, and has stockpiles of older and less precise systems. As Kyiv acquires additional advanced Western air defense, this may impact Russia’s willingness to expend its precious, hard-to-produce advanced missile systems in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uncrewed-aerial-vehicles&quot;&gt;UNCREWED AERIAL VEHICLES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAVs, including combat drones, remain one of Moscow’s pivotal combat elements against Ukraine. According to the Kremlin, at the start of the war in February 2022, Russian troops had approximately 2,000 military drones of all types at their disposal across the services and military commands. By the end of 2022, several hundred of these drones had been destroyed by Ukrainian air defense, EW countermeasures, or Russian pilot errors. Still, Russian-made UAVs — including the Orlan-10 intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and Lancet-3 loitering kamikaze drones — continue to fly in Ukraine, indicating that this pivotal aerial capability matches at least part of Moscow’s demand for ISR and combat missions against Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/X3Sl5DT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;A downed Russian drone in Kyiv in March 2022.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the war, Russian officials have stressed the importance of launching a large-scale production of UAVs of various kinds. Russian defense conglomerate Rostec also confirmed in January 2023 that it is manufacturing new reconnaissance and combat drones, albeit without providing any production rate numbers. However, recent statements by Russian UAV industry representatives suggest that due to high demand, domestic defense enterprises might be struggling to provide UAV-related IT solutions, as well as necessary information security products and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compensate for the existing domestic constraints with UAV manufacturing, the Kremlin has increased its reliance on Chinese commercial drones despite their limited range and capabilities as civilian-designed UAVs. Most of these civilian drones are produced by Chinese tech companies, including Da-Jiang Innovations Science &amp;amp; Technology Co. (DJI), and up until recently could have been purchased through the Chinese online retail service AliExpress. In an effort to restrict these drones’ use on the battlefield in Ukraine, AliExpress has temporarily restricted Russians from buying DJI drones as of March 2, 2023, and those already purchased will allegedly have their functionality limited. This may reflect a concern among China-based companies of being subject to potential secondary sanctions from the West. However, these drones can be purchased from other countries and ultimately shipped to Russia. There is also a continuous flow of DJI quadcopters to the front due to Russian volunteers’ organized procurement efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also received — and will likely continue to receive — loitering (kamikaze) UAVs from Iran and commercial DJI-type quadcopters and multirotor UAVs via supply chains from the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, and Singapore as late as November and December 2022. Moscow is particularly interested in acquiring up to 6,000 Iranian drones due to their low cost and apparent ease of operation. The Shahed-136 (flying under a Russian Geran-2 name), for example, an Iranian drone frequently used by the Russian military against Ukrainian energy infrastructure and military targets, is relatively cheap with a price range of around $20,000 to $50,000 per unit. Moscow’s potential acquisition of more Iranian loitering drones — whether via a transfer or by constructing a UAV-manufacturing factory in Russia proper — may enable continuous rounds of Russian drone attacks, extracting significant costs on Ukrainian air defense and impacting both dual-use targets and the civilian population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aircraft&quot;&gt;AIRCRAFT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is estimated to have lost anywhere between 78 and 305 aircraft in the war and to have kept roughly 4,000 in reserve. Moscow has largely deployed older aircraft in Ukraine, including the Su-25s, with limited success. More advanced aircraft such as the Su-34s and Su-35s, the latter considered Russia’s flagship heavy fighter, have also been spotted over the skies in Ukraine (especially the Su-34s). While Russia’s next-generation fighter aircraft, the Su-57s, due to their high cost and limited production rate, were most likely restricted from flying over Ukraine to avoid being shot down by Ukrainian air defenses. Interestingly, as the war demonstrated the relative effectiveness of less-expensive weapons systems like missiles and drones over Russian aircraft, the Kremlin reportedly traded more than 60 Su-35s to Iran in exchange for several thousand drones used to target Ukrainian civilian and dual-use infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Russia’s aviation sector is among the industries hardest hit by the allied export restrictions. Following the invasion, major U.S. and French plane manufacturers Boeing and Airbus ceased deliveries of new foreign jets and spare parts to Russia. Sanctions have impacted Moscow’s ability to sustain its older aircraft, as well as to further develop and mass produce its next-generation combat vehicles, including the Su-57s, which depend on imported advanced machine tools and engines (as discussed in the next section). As there is some overlap between parts used for military and civilian aircraft, Russia reportedly started stripping spare parts from its passenger aircraft in summer 2022, which has created additional complications, most mechanical in nature, for the already struggling domestic civilian aircraft industry. More recently, Rosaviatsia, Russia’s Federal Air Transport Agency, has approved “aircraft cannibalization,” allowing spare parts from grounded airframes to be reinstalled on in-service aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, sanctions will likely make it even more difficult for Russia to manufacture next-generation combat vehicles, ultimately impacting the military reputation of the Russian Air Force and Moscow’s ability to find customers for its domestically manufactured combat aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/S7YA8hu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image7&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;In October 2022, a Su-34 crashed into a residential building in the Russian town of Yeysk, located near Ukraine. Russian authorities said a “technical malfunction” was a likely cause for the accident.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electronic-warfare-systems&quot;&gt;ELECTRONIC WARFARE SYSTEMS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic warfare (EW) uses radio signals, infrared sensing, jamming, and radar to track adversaries and interfere with their communications systems. During the 2010s, Moscow made considerable advances in EW, acquiring several hundred various new and modernized EW systems designed to defend ground forces, aircraft, and surface ships from the enemy’s radar and precision-guided munitions and to conduct ISR operations. Throughout 2022, Russia has used these EW systems with relative success, reportedly eliminating up to 90 percent of the drones Kyiv possessed in February by summer 2022 and actively jamming the air-to-ground and air-to-air communications of Ukrainian pilots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the specific EW technologies used by the Russian Armed Forces, the Palantin EW system has been the most effective at jamming small Ukrainian drones. Other notable EW technologies are the Svet and Tirada EW systems — which Russia has used to determine the position of enemy forces — and the Rtut EW device that has impacted radio fuses on Ukrainian artillery shells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian EW systems also come with downsides that have restricted their ability to prevent Ukrainian military advances during the Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Kherson offensives. First, they cannot cover the entirety of the front, only parts of it, which has enabled Ukrainian military activity even at close range, as evidenced by numerous videos of Ukrainian drones dropping munitions right on top of Russian ground positions. Russia’s EW systems also work best when their operators have plenty of time to set up and coordinate different functions and hence are less effective when Russian battalions attack and retreat quickly. Due to poor planning and lack of coordination, Russian EW troops even jammed their own communications in the first days of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional limitation is that these systems cannot work continuously. With a restricted lifetime of around 900 to 1,000 hours, each EW system can only be turned on for three to four hours per day, meaning that at least six to eight systems are needed to cover a particular zone for 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to produce its EW systems, Russia keeps relying on Western electronics, including components restricted by the allied export regulations such as microcontrollers, microprocessors, controller area network (CAN) transceivers, digital signal processors, and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not directly related to EW, another important factor worth noting is the Russian military’s flawed use of communications systems. For instance, at the beginning of the invasion, Russian forces used civilian mobile phones and Chinese portable radios for communication purposes that lacked military-grade encryption, naturally impacting their performance on the battlefield. Recent reports show that, while this issue has been acknowledged, the Russian military still, in some cases, relies on unencrypted communications, endangering operational security in Ukraine. Reportedly, Russians are also purchasing China-made counterfeit radio stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the Armed Forces of Ukraine can exploit the downsides exhibited by Russian EW and communications systems to negate the alleged strengths of these technologies on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-kremlins-existing-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;The Kremlin’s Existing Vulnerabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous section demonstrated that high reliance on imports of sensitive technology is one of the main vulnerabilities of Russia’s defense sector. This section identifies the key dual-use components, restricted under the allied export regulations, likely to present particular challenges for Russia’s efforts to continue producing advanced MBTs, missiles, UAVs, aircraft, and EW devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;optical-systems&quot;&gt;OPTICAL SYSTEMS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optical systems are pivotal to Russia’s modern MBT industry. Before the war, the Russian military imported a critical mass of its leading tank optical systems from France, which has now cut off Russian producers from this important component. Russia appears to be retrofitting its T-80BVM MBT with an optics configuration, the 1G42 gunner sight, which originates from an older model vehicle. Similarly, there are reports that the Russian military is retrofitting its T-72B3M tanks with the less-sophisticated 1PN96MT-02 sight, rather than the higher-end Sosna-U, which can spot enemy tanks up to two kilometers farther away. Additionally, unlike the 1PN96MT-02, the higher-grade Sosna-U system has a daytime channel, instead of just a thermal-imaging channel, and the more advanced ability to use computer sensors to help track targets. It is likely that sanctions and export controls are directly contributing to Moscow’s decision to replace higher-end optical systems with their less advanced alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s tank fleet will likely become even less sophisticated as the war continues. With recent announcements of Western tank deliveries to Ukraine, a mismatch in tank technology could prove costly for Russian efforts to shift the line of battle westward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bearings&quot;&gt;BEARINGS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bearings are critical to producing any type of moving vehicle. Historically, Russia has imported most of its high-quality bearings from Western manufacturers. In 2020, for instance, Russia imported over $419 million worth of ball bearings, around 55 percent of which originated in Europe and North America; Germany was Russia’s largest trading partner, taking up 17 percent of its total imports that year. Following the start of the invasion, major Western producers of bearings exited Russia and ended their sales there. The U.S. government believes that Russia already faces a shortage of this key component, which impacts the production of all vehicles, from tanks to aircraft and even submarines. This shortage is also felt in the civilian industry, as Russia’s rail-dependent economy finds the production and repair of trains directly impaired. Russian domestic producers claim they can reverse the deficit in bearings via import substitution initiatives. Russia could also expand its imports of bearings from China or countries in Southeast Asia such as Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, while Moscow might be able to substitute the import of Western bearings and thus maintain the level of defense-sector production needed to continue its war effort, these bearings will most likely be of a lower quality, which could impact reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;machine-tools&quot;&gt;MACHINE TOOLS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Russia’s dependence on Western-produced precision machine tools is a structural supply chain weakness aggravated by increased economic isolation. Machine tools are critical in the production of numerous weapons and military vehicles, including aircraft. Even before Russia’s 2022 invasion, the country’s machine tool industry had long been in crisis. Despite efforts to diversify away from Western sources since 2014, Western-aligned firms together still provided the overwhelming majority of Russia’s imported machine tools in 2017. Estimates claim that Russia depends on imported products for up to 70–80 percent of its machine tools and construction equipment. With 85 percent of Russian machine tool demand allegedly coming from the defense industry, it is surprising that the government has allowed Western countries to continue to play such a pivotal role in the Russian supply chains of the most technically advanced tools. China, the largest total producer of these items worldwide, also remains dependent on Western imports to build the kind of medium- to high-end machine tools that Russia’s domestic defense market lacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Russia faces a critical deficiency of complex multi-coordinate precision machine tools of the most advanced categories, and it lacks the time and capability needed to find substitutes for Western suppliers. While Russian producers claim to have designed and built a high-end computer numerical control (CNC) machine tool entirely out of domestically produced components, assertions like this are difficult to trust or verify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;engines&quot;&gt;ENGINES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has struggled to access certain important aircraft engines since 2014 due to its dependence on the Ukrainian producer Motor Sich for key components in their production. By 2005, the Kremlin had already identified the need to move toward fully domestic helicopter engine production, but this goal has remained seemingly unrealized. In 2014, Russia state-aligned media announced the expansion of operations at the St. Petersburg Klimov plant — a subsidiary of the state-owned Rostec corporation — with the explicit goal of replacing the Russian military’s dependence on Motor Sich’s aircraft engines. Yet the October 2022 arrest of Motor Sich’s owner, Viacheslav Bohuslaiev, in Ukraine on charges that his firm relied on transnational networks to supply Russia with helicopter engines and components suggests that Moscow’s own efforts to increase its supply of engines through import substitution remain incomplete. Indeed, Russia’s trouble with production of high-end engines was already notable before the 2022 invasion. For example, the new Su-57 fighter jets allegedly still rely on older fourth-generation engines — specifically the Saturn AL41-F1 engines used in the previous Su-35S aircraft — while efforts to produce a more advanced engine have been repeatedly delayed, providing further evidence of Russia’s difficulties to produce the most cutting-edge fighter jet engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s civil industries similarly suffer from the shortage of aircraft engines. For example, its Sukhoi Superjet 100 airplanes might now be relying on engines produced from the used components of 17 types of older engines. Similarly, Chinese engine producer Weichai has stopped providing engines for use in tractors produced by the Russian firm KamAZ, as the latter was placed under Western sanctions for being an alleged supplier of materiel to the Russian military. Just as with the Sukhoi Superjet 100, KamAZ is now apparently producing tractors with an outdated 820 (V8) gas engine. These examples suggest that export controls are in some cases forcing Russian producers to turn to older models to fulfill engine production targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;microchips&quot;&gt;MICROCHIPS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s domestic chip production is many years behind the industry standard in the West, making its weapons, communications, and EW systems highly reliant on Western-manufactured microchips, which are currently restricted under the allied export regulations. For instance, according to the UK-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), the Orlan-10 UAV contains U.S.-origin chips manufactured by Texas Instruments and Honeywell. Open-source data also confirms the presence of Western-manufactured chips inside Russia’s Lancet drone. Furthermore, an investigation by Conflict Armament Research has shown that satellite navigation units in several Russian missiles — such as the 3M14, 9M544, Kh-59, and Kh-101 — contain multiple foreign-made microcomponents manufactured between 2012 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s newly developed radio communications systems — including the Azart portable radio station, designed to provide jamming and secure communications at the tactical level — also appear to rely on many Western-produced components. According to data provided by the Center for Army, Conversion, and Disarmament Studies (CACDS), the Azart holds six components of foreign origin, including the Spartan-6 chip, which encrypts communications and is produced by the U.S. company Xilinx in Taiwan. As a dual-use item, the Spartan-6 is commercially available and can be purchased via AliExpress. Similarly, Russia’s reconnaissance, command, and communications complex Strelets-M relies on seven components of foreign origin, including a chip produced by the U.S.-based Microchip Technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dependence of Russia’s military industrial complex on foreign-manufactured microchips can be explained by at least two factors. First, chips and chip microprocessors produced domestically by a small number of companies — such as Baikal Electronics, STC Module, SPC Elvis, and MCST — tend to be of inferior quality to Western designs. In early 2022, the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs even complained about the difficulties of launching and operating equipment based on the domestic Elbrus-8C processors. Following the imposition of Western sanctions, these companies have been unable to officially purchase technologies from the United States and its allies participating in the sanctions regime, including the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) on which Russian chip producers greatly relied. Replacing these components with Chinese options in some cases requires a complete redesign of electronic equipment and restructuring of cooperation chains, which may take years to complete. Moreover, Chinese chips often lag behind the leading Western microchip designs. While certain chips (such as the Spartan-6, the TSOP66, and the LQFP64) found in the Russian-made Azart and 9M544 precision missile can be purchased via AliExpress, as mentioned above, dependence on such commercially available elements can make Russian weapons systems less reliable and prone to failure. For example, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo suggested that “nearly 40 percent of the less advanced microchips Russia is receiving from China are defective.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Russian chip industry cannot meet high demand for these elements. Today, the country requires up to 30,000 plates of basic-level microchips per month, but only 8,000 plates can be made domestically. Recently, the government announced the launch of a new technology park in the country’s Ulyanovsk region as part of an effort to accelerate its chip production. Yet, under the export controls, it would be difficult to estimate the park’s production rate and quality of its products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to these restrictions, and to ensure continued access to high-quality microchips for its weapons systems, Moscow has developed a number of illegal supply chains, discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-sanctions-adaptation-strategy&quot;&gt;Russia’s Sanctions Adaptation Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia was first sanctioned by the West in 2014, following its intervention in Ukraine. In response, Moscow made it a national security priority to reduce its dependency on Western imports, including in the high-tech sector, albeit with limited success. Since the start of the 2022 invasion, the Kremlin has expanded upon the 2014 import substitution efforts, aiming at replacing imports in all aspects of its economy, including the military sector, with domestically produced materials. Yet import substitution has proved to be a daunting task for Russia’s defense industry given its reliance on foreign-produced microelements and spare parts. While Iran — already a sanctioned economy — continues to supply Russia with certain military equipment and technologies, many countries outside of the transatlantic community cannot openly aid Moscow’s war effort without risking sanctions by the West. This forces Moscow to rely on illicit supply chains to obtain restricted foreign elements. While Russia’s efforts to circumvent sanctions will have successes and will mitigate their impact, the Kremlin’s sanctions-evasion efforts also face their own limitations. Sanctions are thus likely to reduce the volume of components Russia can import, increase the costs of those imports, and lead to supply disruptions that affect industrial output. This section examines Russia’s ongoing attempts to adapt to the Western sanctions regime and mitigate its impacts on the domestic defense sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-kremlins-import-substitution-efforts&quot;&gt;THE KREMLIN’S IMPORT SUBSTITUTION EFFORTS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian government has repeatedly promised to accelerate import substitution for domestically produced equipment heavily reliant on foreign components, including armored vehicles, UAVs, and EW technologies. Yet several months before the war, Russia’s own internal assessment of the defense program introduced in 2019 found it largely unable to provide domestic replacements for Western equipment and electronics. Western intelligence corroborates this assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recent initiatives the Kremlin introduced after the invasion also tend to be viewed as too ambitious and far-fetched by local defense and military experts. For instance, to reduce Russia’s dependence on imported microchips, in mid-October 2022 the government introduced the National Project for Electronics, aimed at significantly boosting production of microprocessors and supplying around 30 percent of Russian households with Russian-made electronics by 2030. But Russian tech specialists criticized this project, with its estimated cost of up to $42 billion, for being “virtually impossible to implement” within the given timeframe. Russia is far behind the technology frontier to produce the full range of advanced microchips its defense industry requires within this timespan. Similarly, in mid-February 2023, the Kremlin announced a new national project featuring a grant program to produce necessary UAV components inside the country. However, the implementation of this project will take years, if not decades, to realize. Even Russian minister of finance Anton Siluanov recently acknowledged that “it just takes more time” to replace foreign equipment and electronics with domestically produced alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the government’s more tangible approaches includes funding existing defense enterprises to boost their production. Russian state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec is one of the chief enablers (and beneficiaries) of the Kremlin’s decision to pivot to domestic production. Rostec routinely advertises its capacity to help manufacture a range of modern weapons systems, including UAVs, tanks, aircraft, and missiles. Since the start of the war, it has promoted its ability to create high-quality technologies that can be exported abroad, among them Russian-made anti-drone (the Repellent-1, RLK-MCE, RB-504P-E, and RB-504A-E) and anti-aircraft (the Pantsir-S1, Tor-M2KM, Tor-M2E, and S-350E Vityaz) missile systems. Rostec is expected to attract a significant share of state funding, including 4.7 billion rubles (around $62.6 million) in the 2023 fiscal year. Although the United States and its allies sanctioned Rostec and its subsidiaries in June 2022, specific transactions involving certain Rostec-affiliated blocked entities, such as those that ensure the safety of civil aviation, can still be authorized. This might allow the defense conglomerate to circumvent sanctions by acquiring certain dual-use technologies through its affiliated firms involved in civil aviation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3cZQLnK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;The Rostec headquarters in Moscow, Russia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has also supported private defense enterprises, including the Kronshtadt Group, a Russian defense contractor manufacturing UAVs such as the Orion drones, which have also been deployed in Ukraine. While the United States sanctioned Kronshtadt in March 2022, the company has long claimed that it can domestically produce all components for its growing list of ISR and combat UAVs. Yet anecdotal evidence suggests that the firm might have an office in Antalya, Turkey — in theory enabling Kronshtadt to import necessary components for its UAV production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Russia’s current efforts at import substitution are fraught with challenges stemming from largely inadequate state aid programs and limited official supply chains, which are ultimately restricting the production capabilities of Russian defense enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sanctions-evading-land-corridors&quot;&gt;SANCTIONS-EVADING LAND CORRIDORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing obvious import substitution challenges, the Russian government swiftly established alternative routes to access restricted foreign components and technologies. This effort, which increased throughout the second half of last year, has so far proved to be somewhat successful, as imports of dual-use commodities to Russia in 2022 exceeded their prewar levels, according to multiple sources. For instance, the value of semiconductor imports rose from $1.82 billion in 2021 to $2.45 billion in 2022, based on estimates by the Free Russia Foundation. But to reach Russia shipments now have to go through numerous obscure suppliers and multiple land corridors, as detailed below, making this experience rather volatile, costly, and time-consuming for the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite facing additional Western sanctions for aiding Moscow’s war efforts, Iran has remained one of Russia’s regular suppliers of both key weapons systems, including the Shahed-136 UAVs, and restricted dual-use components. Interestingly, according to CACDS, even Iranian-origin Shahed-136 drones contain microelements produced across various Western nations, including microcontrollers and microprocessors made by the U.S.-based Texas Instruments and NXP USA Inc., respectively. Given that Iran has decades of experience circumventing Western sanctions, Tehran can likely illegally access such components for its growing UAV industry and share that experience with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the Islamic Republic’s ways to receive Western-manufactured weapons and components is across its poorly monitored borders with Iraq. According to Middle East expert Vera Mironova, Iraq purchases multiple high-tech Western-produced components, including engines, under the pretext of an alleged war on terrorism. Those items are then sent to Iran, ultimately ending up in Russian ports, including Astrakhan, via the Caspian Sea. This geographical corridor features numerous existing and newly constructed infrastructure projects from Iran across the Caspian Sea and into Russia. Tehran and Moscow are also considering a sanctions-evading rail link, running along the coast of the Caspian Sea, that would connect India to Russia through Iran and Azerbaijan. This project, which supposedly will be completed in three years, is considered a much shorter and less time-consuming alternative to the current sea route that requires India to ship goods to Russia through Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides Iran, China is reportedly another Russian source for dual-use goods. Based on Russian customs data, Chinese state-owned defense enterprises export microchips and microchip components, engine pieces, navigation equipment, jamming technology, and jet fighter parts to the sanctioned Russian defense companies, including Rostec and its affiliates. Russian entities might have also received up to 1,000 “civilian hunting rifles,” as well as 12 shipments of drone parts and around 12 tons of body armor from Chinese firms, which were routed via Turkey and the UAE between June and December 2022. While Chinese officials say that Beijing is committed to promoting peace talks, there are growing signs that it might actually be considering supplying the Russian military with the ZT-180 prototype kamikaze drones, which bear a close resemblance to the Shahed-136 UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Balkan peninsula is another popular location for intermediary companies involved in sanctions evasion. For instance, Bosnian firm Inzenjering BN, based in the Republic of Srpska, has reportedly supplied helicopter engine parts to the Russian army with the help of Ukrainian company Motor Sich since 2017. In 2018, Motor Sich delivered more than 600 shipments containing the TV3-117 helicopter engines to Inzenjering BN, which then allegedly shipped them to Russia. In October 2022, Ukrainian authorities arrested the head of Motor Sich, Viacheslav Bohuslaiev, for supplying Moscow with helicopter engines and other spare parts. Yet the company could have delivered significant shipments prior to Bohuslaiev’s detainment. More recently, an investigation by the Balkans–Ukraine Cooperation Network discovered that Moscow-based Russian military–affiliated manufacturer Aerotechnikservis (ATS), which supplies helicopters and aviation components, closely cooperates with the firm Aero Engineering Solutions (AES). AES is owned by Canada-based company Aerosupport Solutions Ltd., with offices in Sarajevo and the Republic of Srpska. In 2022, AES sent several cargoes of Western-manufactured components needed for Russian-made helicopters (including the MI-8 and MI-171) to ATS through these routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey has also emerged as an important intermediary involved in smuggling sanctioned goods. According to Reuters, Turkish company Azu International alone has exported more than $20 million worth of components to Russia, including U.S.-origin microchips. Another firm, CTL Diş Ticaret Limited Şirketi, established by Russian national Pavel Pertsov in March 2022, shipped navigation equipment, potentially including GPS systems with anti-jamming technology and high-precision positioning products for UAVs, from a Canadian firm to Russian enterprises supplying the domestic defense sector. Even though Turkish customs authorities have reportedly been rejecting transit declarations for sanctioned goods that had Russian and Belarusian entities listed as end users due to “pressure from the European Union” since March 2023, this will not eliminate an important transit hub, but will make it costlier for Moscow to access the restricted components via Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RShW2mV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image9&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many post-Soviet countries across Central Asia and the South Caucasus also take considerable risks to supply Russia. For example, imports of different Western-made spare parts from Armenia, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan have increased significantly since the start of the war. Some Western manufacturers now even ask their customers to confirm that their physical location is outside of Russia by scheduling video calls with procurement officers. Illegal supply chains also run through the member states of the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), which includes Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. The EEU offers a particularly convenient land corridor for avoiding sanctions, as products imported into the EEU countries are also provided with guarantees valid for Russia. While, recently, Kazakhstan has promised to “closely monitor our mutual trade with all partners” (including Russia), in an effort to avoid secondary sanctions, time will show the effectiveness of such an effort. In addition to the EEU member states, Georgia may also be providing another route via modernized Black Sea port facilities. Reportedly, cargoes with shipping labels for Central Asia are offloaded in Georgia and then transported to Russia by various trucking companies. Lastly, Belarus is emerging as an important corridor for clandestine transfer of Chinese goods and/or equipment to Russia, such as combat drones, personal weapons, and artillery shells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although extensive, these land corridors do not provide a complete picture of the sanctions-evading supply chains developed by Moscow. In 2022, Russia imported numerous restricted high-tech components from third countries across Asia, Africa, and Europe through a multitude of shell and front companies using false end-user certificates and transshipments. While these exporters are, in many cases, operated by foreign-based Russian nationals or expatriates with limited public profiles, the local authorities of countries allegedly used as land corridors should monitor the situation more carefully to avoid the risk of secondary sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. government and its allies have initiated a commendable effort to prevent the Russian military from accessing the key components, elements, and materials outlined in this paper. U.S. intelligence has estimated that since February 2022, export controls have degraded Russia’s ability to replace more than 6,000 pieces of military equipment, forced key defense industrial facilities to halt production, and caused shortages of critical components for tanks and aircraft, among other effects. Efforts by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) span the globe and represent some of the widest sanctions attempted against a country to date. The Kremlin is aware of this work and seeks to circumvent OFAC and its affiliated initiatives in a race that may well determine the outcome of the war in Ukraine. The Department of the Treasury and broader U.S. government recognize the magnitude of the task before them and are adjusting their actions based on real and intended outcomes. These efforts will become even more important as the war enters its second year and the Russian military shows no signs of abandoning its major goal of occupying Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the classified nature of the data in question, many of the assessments in this paper have had to rely on incomplete or circumstantial evidence. Nonetheless, this paper draws several conclusions about the impact of sanctions to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;1-sanctions-work-by-creating-shortages-of-certain-higher-end-components-and-forcing-the-russian-ministry-of-defense-to-substitute-them-with-lower-quality-alternatives&quot;&gt;1. Sanctions work by creating shortages of certain higher-end components and forcing the Russian Ministry of Defense to substitute them with lower-quality alternatives.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In particular, the sanctions have forced Russia to rely on older and less accurate missiles. However, the Russian military’s continued strikes against Ukraine are an important indicator that the Ministry of Defense can still adapt by repurposing different types of missiles. As long as the Russian forces can conduct such attacks — even if they are less frequent and less accurate — there is still a danger to the Ukrainian military and to civilian targets, not to mention the collateral damage that is an egregious and unfortunate consequence of such strikes. Russia’s ability to continue such attacks may be augmented by efforts of partner nations such as Iran or China, whose deliveries of parts and technology may not be impacted by the U.S.-led sanctions efforts. Given the Russian military’s prioritization of missile strikes on the battlefield, such tactics will likely continue, albeit with limited frequency, well into 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Second, the impact on engine production can have long-term effects on the Russian military, especially on recovery, repair, and rebuilding efforts and attempts to develop and deliver newer military systems to the front, including aircraft. The Russian government is aware of this impact, evidenced by its continuing attempts to portray domestic heavy industry and the war effort as being unaffected by sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Third, the Russian government’s efforts to acquire microchips produced by the world’s leading companies has received significant attention since the start of the war. Numerous investigations, some outlined in this report, point to the difficulty of fully and completely controlling the flow of this technology to Russia. Given their importance to Russian military systems, weapons, and technologies, the Kremlin’s efforts to acquire microchips may become even more pronounced in 2023. Reliance on imported microelectronics products that may be inferior to some of the market leaders could potentially affect the quality of Russian-manufactured weapons but will not entirely slow down or prevent the Ministry of Defense from conducting military operations. At the same time, Russia’s own domestic push to launch microchip production is a long-term effort that is unlikely to deliver immediate results for either civilian industries or the military. As the war enters its second year, the Russian government is likely to intensify its attempts to acquire microchips via existing efforts outlined in this paper, as well as through new schemes to circumvent sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fourth, Russia is likely experiencing shortages of advanced optical systems, forcing it to retrofit its tanks with less-sophisticated systems, a mismatch that could prove costly for Russian efforts to shift the line of battle westward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fifth, Russia likely faces a shortage of bearings, which impacts the production of all vehicles. However, Russia might be able to substitute existing shortages with Asian components of a lower quality. The full impact of such shortages is unknown given Russia’s ability to wage war well into 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;2-russia-still-possesses-a-remarkable-degree-of-adaptability-to-western-sanctions&quot;&gt;2. Russia still possesses a remarkable degree of adaptability to Western sanctions.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Russian military is crafty in its use of dual-use components. Russia is by no means the first country to turn to civilian technology to augment its military capabilities, but the size and scope of this war is forcing Moscow to work on an unprecedented scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Last year’s U.S. sanctions efforts have also revealed the difficulty of controlling the flow and acquisition of civilian and dual-use components and products that may end up in military systems, giving the Russian military some breathing space as its global acquisition efforts evolve to match the endeavors of OFAC. As this report shows, there are still plenty of ways for the Russian Ministry of Defense to get what it needs, as the Kremlin takes advantage of the global economy, complex supply chains, and partner countries willing to work with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Major supply shortages are forcing Russia to turn to less technologically advanced items, as well as Soviet-era defense stocks. As the Russian military starts fielding older systems modernized in recent months — and as it continues to use imported military technology — the quality of such military operations is coming into question, especially compared to Ukraine’s ongoing acquisition and fielding of Western-supplied weapons and systems. The pace and quality of Russian military operations will in fact depend on the Ukrainian military’s ability to field systems capable of countering Russian tactics. In other words, the Russian military can still field a modernized T-62 tank (first unveiled in the early 1960s) on the battlefield even if this vehicle lacks sophisticated countermeasures or optics. But the effectiveness of these systems will be significantly offset by Ukraine’s continued access to more advanced Western technology such as Javelin, Stugna, or NLAW anti-tank weapons or precision-guided artillery. Additionally, the Russian military can continue to launch Iranian-provided Shahed-136 combat drones at Ukrainian energy infrastructure without worrying that most are shot down, placing the onus on the Ukrainian defenders to expend valuable air-defense ammunition. This is the crux of this war in its second year: the Russian military can rely on its mass and continue feeding older or less than state-of-the-art technology as long as it thinks it can simply outlast the Western deliveries of weapons and systems to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;3-sanctions-have-made-moscow-opt-for-a-slower-paced-attritional-campaign&quot;&gt;3. Sanctions have made Moscow opt for a slower-paced attritional campaign.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Russia has lost a significant number of military vehicles, which could limit its capacity for large-scale ground offensives. This could be one reason why the Russian government, and President Putin in particular, are presenting this war as a long-term endeavor necessary to ensure Russia’s security. Ensuring a long-term struggle that slowly exhausts Ukrainian weapons stocks while outlasting Western aid efforts appears central to Russia’s strategy in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the same time, turning this war into a slow-paced attritional campaign creates a little breathing space for the sanctioned Russian domestic defense industry to come up with the necessary solutions and workarounds outlined in this report. There is some evidence that the Russian government and military are exhausted and would prefer this conflict to enter the concluding stage, managed by the international community. In a statement on February 28, 2023, a Kremlin spokesperson indicated that peace negotiations with Kyiv are possible if Russia gets to keep the Ukrainian regions it currently controls: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya, along with Crimea. But even if Kyiv were to agree to such negotiations, it remains unclear whether the Russian government would limit its ambitions to the regions it already occupies if Ukraine maintains its pro-Western political and military orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thus, as long as the Kremlin maintains its current outlook on Ukraine, the war is expected to continue, with Moscow preferring a slower-paced attritional campaign without significant breakthroughs or advances that could put further pressure on its military and industrial base already stretched thin by sanctions and the last 12 months of the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is not possible to completely control the flow of commercial parts that end up in the Russian military system, the authors of this report propose several ways for Western policymakers to close the loopholes actively used by the Russian government:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue supplying Ukraine with higher-end military equipment at a pace that exceeds Russia’s production rate, which will make it harder for Russia to maintain an attritional war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identify and target illicit networks, and particularly individuals involved in current sanctions-evasion efforts. In doing so, the United States should use its leverage in the post-Soviet region more proactively, including in Armenia, Georgia, and Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Restrict any existing transactions with Russian and Russia-linked defense companies and their affiliates. For example, Rostec subsidiaries and affiliated companies involved in civil aviation should be prevented from importing and sending sanctioned dual-use technologies to other Rostec affiliates involved in the production of different weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eliminate the loopholes that allow some Western companies to import equipment into Russia by extending past contracts that preceded the imposition of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work toward creating an OFAC equivalent at EU level. Currently, the monitoring of sanctions implementation and compliance lies within the member states, which may lead to disparities, as EU states have varied capacity in this regard. Such a structure will require strong local expertise to perform the necessary investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方欲趙家賢澄清協調會細節 官質疑不重要：「我們會知道所有真相嗎？」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3eEnUxk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（13日）踏入審訊第42天。趙家賢接受代表楊雪盈的大狀張耀良盤問，形容楊雪盈是「好溫和務實嘅獨立議員」，積極推動藝術政策，很得較為建制守舊的大坑區居民歡心。趙曾與楊就協調會議討論，指楊亦知道戴耀廷是「成日有好多諗法」的人，亦與趙一樣是「理性溫和務實嘅性格」；就戴會上提及否決預算案，楊認為「咪由佢講吓先囉」，但認為入立法會後每個議員也是「自主行使權力」。趙亦沒有聽過楊提及要迫使特首下台或癱瘓政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙形容楊雪盈為好溫和務實嘅獨立議員-很得大坑區居民歡心&quot;&gt;趙形容楊雪盈為「好溫和務實嘅獨立議員」 很得大坑區居民歡心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表吳政亨和余慧明的大律師石書銘今表示，就吳政亨已完成盤問，就余慧明則沒有盤問，其後代表楊雪盈的大律師張耀良開始盤問。趙家賢確認，於2015年楊雪盈參與區議會選舉時認識她，楊其後當選灣仔（大坑）區議員，二人雖屬不同區議會，但就公共服務有溝通和接觸，亦維持良好的工作關係。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，楊雪盈沒有政治聯繫，當時在公共服務上亦是新手，並指雖然楊是新任議員，但「佢喺大坑嗰度係好得當地嘅居民嘅歡心」，又指與楊特別有聯繫，是因他中學時於大坑坊眾會有義工服務的聯繫。趙又指，知道該區是「比較上好建制好守舊」的選區，但楊雪盈以她對藝術的專業和在大坑的服務，「令到當地嘅居民知道，可能佢係相對上支持民主嘅信念……」，惟被張耀良打斷，指稍後會談及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續確認，楊雪盈積極推動文化藝術政策及社區服務文化美學，亦常推動將政府撥款用於她倡議的文化及改善民生政策，並形容楊的社區參與撥款「好新穎」，「用咗一啲新嘅諗法而係好有效地服務到社區嘅居民」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙亦確認，楊雪盈於2019年區議會選舉連任，並當選灣仔區議會主席。張耀良一度問楊當選主席是否因為她較溫和，惟法官陳仲衡即打斷，指趙並不是投選楊的人，不能回答其問題。張改問楊的政治立場是否溫和，趙形容楊是「好溫和務實嘅獨立嘅議員」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱楊表示戴耀廷有想法由佢講吓強調議員入立會後自主行使權力&quot;&gt;趙稱楊表示戴耀廷有想法「由佢講吓」強調議員入立會後「自主行使權力」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張耀良續就「35+計劃」發問，趙同意自己甚少參與在港島區協調工作當中，並確認只出席過首次港島協調會議，而且遲到早退。張問到趙有否在會上聽到楊相當反對否決財政預算案，趙表示在會上沒有特別聽到，但會後有與楊討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，楊於2015年已經知悉戴耀廷對區議會選舉的計劃，「咁應該咁講，楊雪盈都知戴耀廷係成日有好多諗法嘅人，而楊雪盈同我都係嗰種理性溫和務實嘅性格」，因此兩人在會後傾談時，楊亦表示「戴耀廷又有啲佢嘅諗法又帶出嚟㗎啦，咪由佢講吓先囉，但即係選到入立法會裡面嘅時候，係每個議員自主行使個權力㗎嘛！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問到兩人是否在首次協調會議後討論，趙稱忘記是哪次，但指在一些會議中途與楊就區議會工作交流時，有討論戴耀廷就「35+計劃」的協調事宜，並在法官陳仲衡追問下確認是在「墨落無悔」聲明出現前討論。翻查資料，楊雪盈名字曾出現在「墨落無悔」聲明。法官李運騰質疑，趙稱只是出席過首次會議並早退，因此他不會是在當日會後與楊討論，趙同意，並澄清自己是之後與楊用電話溝通。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱楊雪盈無特別提及迫特首下台或癱瘓政府&quot;&gt;趙稱楊雪盈無特別提及迫特首下台或癱瘓政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續問，楊與趙對話中有沒有提過任何「35+計劃」的目標，包括要迫使特首下台或癱瘓政府？趙指楊沒有特別提到，只是提及戴耀廷的公開說法。張問，那據趙的印象，會否認為楊反對否決財政預算案？法官陳慶偉指趙已回答楊曾稱「由佢（戴耀廷）講吓」，趙同意，重申楊認為「佢（戴）好多諗法，由佢講囉」。陳問，即楊沒有表示支持或反對否決財案？趙同意，稱楊「淨係覺得之後入到立法會應該自主行事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再問，既然楊無意遵從協調會議共識，為何她仍然要參與「35+計劃」？趙表示，沒有與楊就最終有否參與官方選舉有特別討論，他亦指「所以如果你問我個人點樣解讀佢呢個行為嘅話…」，李打斷稱不是要他解讀，而是問他有否被告知，趙逐回應：「我冇同佢特別傾過，所以我唔太清楚」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問楊雪盈及戴耀廷是否朋友-趙稱兩人工作上有交流&quot;&gt;被問楊雪盈及戴耀廷是否朋友 趙稱兩人工作上有交流&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張耀良其後問到，楊雪盈與戴耀廷是否私下認識，但陳仲衡認為趙不能夠回答有關問題，李運騰亦指除非張指出兩人是朋友。陳慶偉於是改問，以趙所知，兩人實際上是否互相認識？趙回應「佢哋兩位係認識嘅」。陳再問到兩人是否朋友，這時在延伸庭的被告發笑，趙回答：「工作上有交流」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續舉例，指他在工作上認識張耀良多年，但不會真的稱他為朋友，律師席傳來大笑聲。張耀良一度欲修訂問題，指應問楊是否只「認得（recognise）」而非「認識（know）」戴耀廷，李運騰則指沒有太大幫助，指他們全部有出席協調會議，一定會認識對方。張終稱完成盤問，由代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀續盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（13日）踏入審訊第42天。趙家賢繼續接受盤問，供稱只曾出席首次港島協調會議，與主問時稱曾出席首兩次不同。彭卓棋的代表大狀盧敏儀其後欲就會議情況澄清，惟法官陳慶偉質疑並不重要，並反問：「你認為這場審訊完結後，我們就會知道所有事情的真相嗎？」，又指刑事審訊證據常有不一致。此外，趙家賢在盤問下強調，民主動力僅承辦「35+公民投票」，而非整個「35+計劃」，民主動力的角色在初選勝出者當選後便結束。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙主問稱曾出席港島兩次會議惟盤問稱只出席首次-獲展示紀錄仍不能確認有否出席第二次&quot;&gt;趙主問稱曾出席港島兩次會議惟盤問稱只出席首次 獲展示紀錄仍不能確認有否出席第二次&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢今早接受代表楊雪盈的大狀張耀良盤問，形容楊是「好溫和務實嘅獨立議員」，認為入立會後議員應「自主行事」。趙並確認只曾出席過首次港島協調會議，而且遲到早退，與主問供稱曾出席首兩次會議不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙其後接受代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀盤問。盧再問及趙家賢曾出席哪次港島協調會議，趙稱有出席首次3月26日的會議，至於有否出席4月17日的第二次會議則猶豫未能回答。盧續展示趙與民主動力總幹事黎敬輝的對話紀錄，黎於首次會議時曾稱「區軒開始」，趙回覆「Ok… coming」，趙確認有出席首次會議。盧問因此無需再展示第二次會議的紀錄？惟趙稱「抱歉盧大狀你可唔可以畀我睇埋」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧續展示紀錄，顯示第二次會議當天，趙曾向黎確認當天會開會，並着他協助做筆記。黎會議翌日凌晨發送筆記，趙於庭上花數分鐘讀畢，盧問他能否確認曾出席哪次會議？惟趙搔頭思索，未能回答。此時主控萬德豪打斷，表示趙在主問已表明曾出席第一和第二次會議。法官請趙家賢避席，萬續解釋，趙主問時是憑戴耀廷發送的出席者名單確認出席第二次會議，但辯方卻沒有展示該紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，黎敬輝筆記是用來協助喚醒趙的記憶，法官陳慶偉亦指辯方有權發問，而控方有權覆問。盧敏儀一度道歉指她並非故意，惟法官李運騰指無需道歉，指證人剛才宣誓下的證供就是他只出席了首次會議，若與主問的證供有矛盾，控方可以覆問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方欲澄清趙家賢出席會議情況-官稱不重要反指審訊結束難言得知所有真相&quot;&gt;辯方欲澄清趙家賢出席會議情況 官稱不重要反指審訊結束難言得知所有真相&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉其後追問盧敏儀就此發問的用意，盧解釋，趙家賢曾稱司馬文在第二次會議上反對否決預算案，但黎敬輝的筆記無提及，希望澄清；法官李運騰亦補充，區諾軒指司馬文是在第一次會議提出反對。陳慶偉多次追問盧想帶出什麼（“What is your point?”），着她不要為問而問；盧解釋望作澄清，惟陳續指她大可在陳詞指有證供提及司馬文曾反對運用否決權，是哪一次會議提出並不重要。陳並問，盧是否想要削弱趙的證供和挑戰其可信性？盧重申她只是想確認司馬文的反對是在第一次抑或第二次會議發生，不希望陳詞變得混亂（messy）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉反問：「那有什麼問題？你認為這場審訊完結後，我們就會知道所有事情的真相嗎？（“What’s wrong with that? Do you think at the end of this trial, we would know the truth of everything?”）」盧敏儀回覆她盡力嘗試（trying my best）。但陳慶偉再指，在陪審團審訊也會提醒陪審員，他們是來決定被告就控罪是否有罪（determine the guilt of defendant in respect of the charge），但到了最後，也難以說能知道所有真相。盧終同意，只需知道趙家賢在他出席過的協調會議上有否聽過司馬文反對否決預算案，趙家賢返回法庭後確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱彭卓棋曾要求將政網全數移除-趙指沒有印象-截圖顯示彭政綱為空白&quot;&gt;辯方稱彭卓棋曾要求將政網全數移除 趙指沒有印象 截圖顯示彭政綱為空白&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢其後確認，一名叫「Christy」的女士是民主動力就初選項目的兼職員工，與總幹事黎敬輝等分擔處理初選候選人事宜。趙昨供稱，有政黨和候選人曾要求更改政綱，盧問趙是否知道誰要求更改？趙未有直接回答，而是重提其職員問他能否彈性處理有參選人要求修改政綱，但他無法指明是誰要求。李運騰續指若趙家賢直接說「不知道」可節省很多法庭時間（“It would save a lot of time if you simply say ‘I don’t know’.”），趙稱「抱歉法官閣下」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀續指，彭卓棋曾要求「Christy」將其政綱從電子投票系統和票站全數移除，惟趙稱沒有印象。盧續展示電子投票系統的截圖，顯示彭卓棋政綱一欄為空白，趙稱當時自己有投票，但「我只係撳咗個『揀選』然後就『確認』，我就冇撳入去啲政綱度睇」。趙亦沒有印象，有同事曾特別反映票站內沒有彭卓棋的政綱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀其後問及，初選投票日前港島區是否有3次協調會議。法官陳慶偉再請趙避席，指根據其紀錄有4次，惟盧稱盤問時區改稱只有3次。陳慶偉再指相關問題不重要，盧重申不希望陳詞變得混亂，又指知道永遠找不到真相。陳再重申，刑事審訊呈交法庭的證據經常都會有出入和不一致之處（“There are always discrepancies and inconsistencies in evidence presented to court in criminal trial.”），着盧判斷何謂相關和重要的事情。控方之後確認區稱投票前只有3次港島會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱民主動力僅承辦35公民投票非整個35計劃-民動角色於勝選者當選後結束&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱民主動力僅承辦35+公民投票非整個35+計劃 民動角色於勝選者當選後結束&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀表示完成盤問，何啟明沒有盤問，續輪到自行代表的大律師劉偉聰。劉問根據原本計劃，「35+公民投票計劃」在立法會選舉結束後是否就會完結？趙家賢確認。法官陳仲衡續問，但初選有替補被DQ者的機制，民主動力在此有否任何角色？趙指，「呢個係兩位初選協調人佢哋負責，並唔係民主動力，因為民主動力淨係一個服務提供者。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續舉例，假若當選人在立法會拒絕宣誓效忠特區，便會被取消資格，故「35+計劃」直至官方選舉完結後也未結束？趙重申，民主動力負責承辦初選，「我哋嗰個角色淨係做嗰個35+嘅公民投票」，故他指的結束只是指民主動力承辦初選的角色結束，而非指整個計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續問，那趙家賢7月16日也不需宣布退出協調，因當時初選投票已經結束？惟趙指，如當時沒有特別情況發生，民主動力仍需進行初選後的官方選舉前民意調查，而民調推薦的人當選後「其實我哋個角色就完」。陳續問，但民調後，民主動力仍要出席其他協調會議，以決定出選名單？趙同意，但指召集協調會議和處理協調並非民主動力角色。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉追問為何如此，指民主動力被挑選承辦初選，就是因其參與協調的背景和能力。趙同意，但重申是由戴耀廷和區諾軒進行協調，並同意陳慶偉指，當他說民主動力承辦初選時，該初選是狹義而言，而非指整個「35+計劃」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰問選舉按金會否於首份財政預算發表時發還-趙當時完全冇呢個思考&quot;&gt;劉偉聰問選舉按金會否於首份財政預算發表時發還 趙：當時完全冇呢個思考&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢其後確認，一萬元的選舉按金是確保參選人有遵守協調會議的共識。按金收據列明「選舉按金將於立法會選舉後全數發還」，劉偉聰問是指什麼時候？趙指若立法會選舉無延期，應指9月中的投票日，解釋在官方選舉投票日過後，參選人有否違反協調共識一事才會變得「清晰明確」；並指因事情性質輕微，故不曾就此與戴耀廷及區諾軒討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續問，據趙理解，發還選舉按金的時間是會在立法會選舉後第一份財政預算案發表時嗎（as late as the introduction of the first budget after the election）？趙稱「回應劉大狀，完全冇呢個思考嘅當時」。劉其後表示完成盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官稱記得逃犯條例於19年9月撤回-趙稱政府首長曾用很多字眼惟市民不滿意&quot;&gt;官稱記得《逃犯條例》於19年9月撤回 趙稱政府首長曾用很多字眼惟市民不滿意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文稱盤問需時，陳慶偉續着押後至明日續審。陳其後主動提出，趙家賢昨供稱《逃犯條例》修訂草案於2019年6月撤回，惟以他個人記憶是在2019年9月。趙回應：「法官閣下，我只可以講其實係一個過程嘅階段，因為當時嘅政府嘅首長係用咗好多唔同嘅字眼，表達個法案已經唔會再運作、運用又好，或者壽終正寢又好，但市民大眾就係唔滿意啦」，並確認無論如何，草案就是於2019年被撤回。&lt;/p&gt;

On April 1, 2014, the government of Japan introduced the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology (hereinafter referred to as the “Three Principles”) to replace the original Three Principles, allowing arms exports only when they contribute to the active promotion of peace and international cooperation, as well as Japan’s national security. The new principles included the Strategy on Defense Production and Technological Bases — which shifted away from the previous policy of maintaining all defense production and the technology base domestically to a policy of allowing some international joint development and joint production. The government has been working on defense equipment transfers under the new Three Principles ever since, but there has been only one transfer of a complete system: the sale of an air-defense radar system to the Philippines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this trend continues, Japan’s defense industrial base will continue to decline. How can Japan reverse this trend and increase exports of defense equipment? This paper explores possibilities for Japan by comparing the defense export systems of other countries, including the U.S. foreign military sales (FMS) program, and assesses whether Japan needs its own version of FMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-international-environment&quot;&gt;The International Environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Japan’s 2022 National Security Strategy highlights, the security environment around Japan is “as severe and complex as it has been since the end of World War II.” Some nations (such as China, North Korea, and Russia) are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;increasing their own national interests at the expense of others . . . , expanding their influence through both military and non-military means, attempting to unilaterally change the status quo, and accelerating actions to challenge the international order. Such moves have sharpened competition and confrontation among states in wide-ranging areas, including military, diplomatic, economic, and technological fields, and have shaken the foundation of the international order. As a result, the current international security environment has become complex and severe, one where inter-state relations and interests of each and every nation are intertwined with each other in a mosaic-like manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, there are worsening risks that these countries could impede free access to and utilization of the cyber, maritime, space, and electromagnetic domains. In the field of international trade, some nations are using economic tools — such as “restricting the exports of mineral resources, food, and industrial and medical supplies, as well as providing loans to other nations” that cannot sustain that level of debt — to influence and coerce other nations. As balances of power shift, there is a lack of strong leadership within the global governance structure to address these issues. The international community is therefore struggling to take on shared challenges such as climate change, arms control, disarmament, nonproliferation, terrorism, food and energy security, and preventing the spread of infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These dynamics are particularly prominent in the Indo-Pacific region. China has been expanding its military power, including nuclear capabilities, and has intensified its attempts to use force to unilaterally change the status quo in the East and South China Seas around Taiwan and the Senkaku Islands. It is also “strengthening its strategic ties with Russia and attempting to challenge the international order.” Meanwhile, Chinese development finance is taking advantage of countries’ reliance on China to exert economic pressure on them. These activities, which are worrying Japan and the international community, present “the greatest strategic challenge in ensuring the peace and security of Japan and the international community, as well as in strengthening the international order based on the rule of law.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s efforts to rapidly expand its nuclear and missile capabilities also pose a graver and more imminent threat to Japan’s national security than before. Meanwhile, Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has “shaken the very foundation of the international order.” Not only is Russian aggression the most significant and direct threat to security in Europe, it has also raised concerns in Japan about how Beijing’s ties with Russia could impact security in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to potential adversaries’ growing capabilities in new and traditional forms of warfare, the government of Japan has concluded it is necessary to fundamentally reinforce Japan’s defense capabilities to protect its citizens. Japan’s new National Defense Strategy, also released in December 2022, notes the importance of both integrating all forms of national power to reinforce Japan’s defense capabilities and enhancing deterrence by strengthening the U.S.-Japan alliance and other forms of security cooperation with like-minded countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japans-dwindling-defense-industrial-base&quot;&gt;Japan’s Dwindling Defense Industrial Base&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the decision to revise the Three Principles in 2014, only one transfer of a complete system has occurred since then, while the defense industrial base has shrunk as Japanese companies withdraw from the sector for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, even though the Three Principles allow defense equipment transfers in principle, the strict conditions in place effectively render exports the exception. Second, because most Japanese defense equipment is produced only for domestic procurement, it would be challenging to ensure they meet a purchasing country’s price, usage, and performance requirements. Third, the benefits of licensed production are no longer available: as defense systems have become more sophisticated and costly, international joint development and production have become the norm, and countries have become more reluctant to issue licenses for defense equipment containing sensitive technologies. In short, early licensed production of mature systems raised few technology-transfer problems, but newer, advanced defense systems naturally raise more releasability challenges. This has resulted in an increase in equipment imports from the United States through FMS, depriving domestic defense firms of opportunities to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If more domestic defense companies withdraw from the market, there is a risk of hindering the capabilities of the Japan Self-Defense Forces ( JSDF). Masashi Murano of the Hudson Institute has documented a case that captures the risk: In 2017, Japanese contractor Sumitomo Heavy Industries was able to quickly and affordably repair damage to the guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain. But if Japan’s defense industry shrinks further, this resilient logistics support capability will decline even in peacetime, slowing the operational tempo of both U.S. and Japanese forces — especially air defense, which requires faster turnaround times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this situation, Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Diet members introduced a proposal noting that since the defense industry is the foundation of Japan’s security, the government should assume the responsibility of sustaining and strengthening it — not just as part of industrial policy, but as a national security policy in and of itself. As it becomes more difficult to maintain a defense industrial base solely through domestic procurement, it is essential for Japan to find a way into overseas markets, both to make the industry more competitive and to boost national security. Furthermore, the overseas transfer of defense equipment — not only complete systems but also repair and maintenance of critical parts — would help promote defense cooperation with other countries in the Indo-Pacific, thereby securing the defense supply chains of partner countries and enhancing Japan’s strategic posture in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the LDP Diet members’ proposal, although the overseas transfer of defense equipment would require proactive efforts by the private sector, the government would have to guide these industry efforts. In deciding whether to allow defense equipment exports, Japanese defense agencies should not only factor in the price, usage, and performance of potential exports, but also the overall state of defense cooperation with the purchasing country. The government would also be responsible for offering training on and maintenance of the equipment, something private companies cannot handle alone, especially in developing countries that have local-content requirements. When bidding on international opportunities, competitors will likely be companies from other advanced countries, whose bids will reflect defense exports supported by national policy and public-private partnerships. As Japan is less experienced with defense equipment transfers, preparing competitive proposals will require Japan’s public and private sectors to build a new cooperative framework in which the government takes the lead in guiding collaboration with the private sector. The LDP Diet members put forth a Japanese version of FMS as one possible model for a “new system of public-private partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business community has voiced similar concerns. According to the Japan Business Federation’s proposal for a new National Security Strategy, Japanese defense-related companies should “implement domestic development with overseas transfers in mind and to build a system of public-private cooperation.” The government could support defense exports by providing capital investments to lower initial costs and usage fees, by expediting the transfer of information and equipment, and by providing operational support and training to recipient countries. To mitigate associated risks, the Japan Business Federation concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;t is necessary to consider the establishment of a system under which the Japanese government receives orders for defense equipment from foreign governments, Japanese defense-related companies deliver the equipment to the Japanese government, and the Japanese government transfers the equipment to foreign governments (a Japanese version of the FMS system).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;benefits-of-fms&quot;&gt;Benefits of FMS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FMS is a form of government-to-government (G2G) transaction in which (as the name implies) the government becomes a contracting party to the purchase and sale of equipment. This is especially prevalent in the international defense market, where — contrary to all the other sectors of the globalized economy — legitimate purchasers are exclusively states, most suppliers are authorized to sell by their respective governments, and the state often directly or indirectly controls the defense industrial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While government support for defense sales is not new, the past 20 years have witnessed a dramatic acceleration of government activities in this area. The globalization of defense markets, together with increased international competition and demand from outside Europe, has led traditional defense suppliers to use G2G agreements more frequently. G2G transactions feature several advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By strengthening their respective military capabilities, purchasing countries can deal more effectively with common threats. Russia and China similarly use sales of military equipment as part of “wider politico-military collaboration agreements.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Purchasing countries can implement a defense acquisition process faster through G2G transactions than through a commercial tender. Since the government is the contracting party, the approval of export licenses may be faster than for commercial contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;G2G transactions entail a public guarantee. Since the government is the contracting party, it facilitates the transfer of equipment. If there are problems with the equipment, the government — not just the supplier company — will be obligated to provide support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supplier companies can “set limits on the requests from purchasers to transfer technologies and know-how under the sales contract.” In fact, the U.S. FMS system restricts technology transfer as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;G2G transactions enable the transfer or sale of surplus equipment held by supplier country armed forces, shifting the costs of storing it to the purchasing country. This helps promote closer cooperation and integration between the countries’ militaries. A supplier country can also use free transfers to encourage the recipient to buy more advanced equipment in the future — as when Germany gave surplus Leopard tanks to other European countries, “paving the way for further acquisitions of later versions of the same tanks.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under G2G transactions, supplier companies also have an advantage during offset negotiations. The government of the supplier country can negotiate offsets on their behalf, and the scope of the offsets can more easily be broadened to include the entire domestic industry, thus reducing the burden on the supplier company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FMS operations in the United States further illustrate the benefits for both supplier and recipient countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For U.S. suppliers, participation in the FMS system reduces administrative burdens. Not only are export licenses incorporated in the FMS process — with the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) managing all required paperwork and permissions — companies can rest easy that all transactions are in accordance with U.S. law, and recipient countries are assured that the acquisition process will be subject to the U.S. Department of Defense’s (DOD) standards through every step of the process. This also dramatically reduces U.S. companies’ risks: because they sign contracts with the DOD, not with a foreign customer, they are guaranteed to get paid and do not have to worry about being sued by recipient countries. This makes it easier for small and medium-sized U.S. defense companies to participate in the FMS system. FMS also creates opportunities for private suppliers to build on U.S. government sales. Since the U.S. government is essentially procuring goods on behalf of a foreign government, the defense companies they are sourcing from may more readily sell these products under FMS, especially those already registered as standard military parts and catalogued with a National Stock Number (NSN). This helps supplier companies expand into international markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States as a whole, FMS strengthens relations with recipient countries by nurturing long-term military relationships, including through access to joint training and doctrine and increased opportunities for standardization with U.S. forces. The United States generally tends to prefer FMS transactions over general exports because the U.S. government has more control over them, which is required for defense exports of sensitive technologies. In practice, defense equipment exports to major countries are a mix of FMS and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the customer, FMS purchases of equipment tend to be cheaper because orders can consolidated and/ or sourced from older U.S. military inventories. (Conversely, this creates a disadvantage in that the product is not new and cannot be customized for the recipient country. This is an increasingly serious problem in cases where customers prefer that sellers build “exportability” into future defense system development.) In addition, the total package approach FMS uses means that the purchase of a major system includes training, spare parts, and other support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the U.S. government — unlike with G2G transactions in other countries — does not participate in offset negotiations, preferring a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy on negotiations between U.S. defense companies and recipient countries. This means that FMS recipient countries do not have to negotiate with the U.S. government, but nevertheless have access to sensitive equipment not available through DCS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FMS and G2G transactions are the same in that the government of the supplier country becomes a party to the contract. For convenience, this paper will refer to FMS as a system in which the government is more involved or acts as an intermediary — in effect becoming the customer for an industry supplier. This role applies not only to sales but also to the entire package, including technical support and services such as training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;feasibility-of-fms-in-japan&quot;&gt;Feasibility of FMS in Japan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can Japan adopt an FMS system that has these advantages for both the supplier and recipient countries?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government of Japan has facilitated some transfers of defense equipment as a form of security assistance to regional neighbors. However, with little experience in international defense operations or exports, it is not able to replicate the complex U.S. FMS process. Many organizations are involved in the U.S. FMS network; DSCA alone employs more than 1,000 people. In addition, the United States holds a dominant share of the international defense market, with approximately 189 nations and international organizations participating in FMS procurements. The United States maintains alliances with many countries with whom it can use FMS transfers to promote standardization — which further contributes to these relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the United States has a defense budget and armed forces much larger than those of Japan, as well as established export markets that support its defense industrial base. In comparison, Japan’s defense industry is not investing in large-scale manufacturing facilities. Even if such facilities were built, it is not clear whether their products would be marketable. Other countries might not be willing to purchase Japanese equipment, which (unlike U.S. equipment) has not been proven through operational experience. In addition, there are no “pure” defense companies in Japan. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) is the largest Japanese defense contractor, but defense comprised only 12 percent of its business in 2021. Defense is also (rightly) viewed as a low-margin business by companies operating in more profitable commercial sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, perhaps there is another equipment export system besides the U.S. FMS model that Japan can use as a reference. Similar G2G transaction processes adopted by other countries may offer useful examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;france&quot;&gt;France&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-status-of-defense-exports&quot;&gt;Current Status of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), in the 2017–2021 period, France’s global share of defense equipment export value was 11 percent, ranking it third in the world. This value grew by 59 percent compared to the previous five-year period (2011–16). Between 2001 and 2020, the total value of French defense exports to Europe declined, while those to all other regions grew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-of-defense-exports&quot;&gt;Background of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France has a higher degree of government involvement in defense equipment exports than other countries. The French state and the defense industry are also structurally interdependent. According to an International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) report, French defense manufacturers are “in the privileged position of facing little competition in producing major weapons systems and selling them to the government.” The Direction Générale de l’Armement (DGA) in the French Ministry of Defense plays a key role by purchasing weapons and controlling defense industrial policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FRANCE’S DEFENSE EXPORT PROMOTION AGENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important instrument for promoting arms exports is the Direction du Développement International (DI), a department within the DGA that is tasked with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;coordinating interministerial initiatives; maintaining contacts with foreign officials with a view to opening new markets to French defense manufacturers; supervising exports by state-owned companies; . . . organising arms fairs in France; coordinating financial assistance for the defense industry; participating in contract negotiations [G2G]; and also offering an after-sales service that includes technical assistance for arms purchasers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONSISTENT ARMS-EXPORT DOCTRINE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon returning to power in 1958, President Charles de Gaulle insisted that France “should be independent from the two superpowers dominating the Cold War.” This required “an autonomous capacity to build weapons systems for the needs of its armed forces.” “Arms sales sustained an independent defense industry, which in turn sustained the French independent posture.” Thus, “success in the arms trade became a symbol of France’s capacity to defend itself — or the business ‘model of our sovereignty.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctrine that arms sales are indispensable to French sovereignty persists: “Arms exports were also regarded as benefiting the French economy as a whole, not only through their direct contribution to the balance of payments and job creation but also through spillover effects for civilian industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The absence of political debate about the direction of France’s arms-export policy means that, to a large extent, the bureaucracy has been allowed to be the arbiter of export controls.” This has made it easier for the French government to address increased competition in the global arms market by simplifying the export-control system and streamlining the processes by which defense companies receive authorization to export. This trend has continued throughout the post–Cold War era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLEXIBLE DEFENSE EQUIPMENT EXPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IISS report notes that in addition to offering proven equipment, France sought to attract customers by “depicting itself as a country that did not attach political conditions to arms sales and would not cease deliveries if a customer’s political or military situation changed.” For example, France was “one of the main suppliers of arms to South Africa during the apartheid era.” In addition, “the lack of response from [Emmanuel] Macron’s government to mounting criticism over arms sales to countries involved in the war in Yemen – primarily Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – suggests that the French arms-export doctrine is being maintained by the current president.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PUBLIC INVESTMENT BANK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public investment bank Bpifrance provides state guarantees, insuring companies against the risk of non-payment. Through Bpifrance, “the state also secured credit provided by private banks to arms purchasers,” which “benefits the arms buyer by making it unnecessary for them to immediately pay the French manufacturer the full price of their acquisition – instead they can repay the bank in instalments.” Moreover, a defense manufacturer that wants to tailor a product to a particular foreign client can receive a government loan to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FRENCH VERSION OF FMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A separate IISS report describes Belgium’s 2019 purchase of 442 French Griffon and Jaguar armored vehicles as “France’s first attempt to sell equipment using its own version of the U.S. FMS system.” This program, in which France purchases vehicles on Belgium’s behalf along with purchases for the French army, not only takes some of the pressure off the Belgian defense ministry but also leverages the French military’s economies of scale to lower the cost for Belgian equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provisions for the Belgian program include close cooperation with France on education and training. However, unlike the U.S. FMS system, France makes no obligations or guarantees on behalf of Nexter, the French company producing these armored vehicles, regarding the price, time, and performance conditions set by the contract. Furthermore, “no liability of France is incurred in the event of termination of the agreement or of the supply protocol, or of the failure of one party, or the occurrence of an external event that permanently and irrevocably opposes the execution of the contract.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In France, in addition to the conventional G2G program centered on DI, there is a recent agreement with Belgium to export CaMo, a new generation truck-mounted artillery system. This has been called a French version of FMS because production for export is carried out in conjunction with production for the French army. However, this is not the same as the U.S. FMS system because of the lack of large government guarantees. France’s own version of FMS still benefits from the country’s flexible export policy, use of an investment bank for financing, and security environment that motivates other countries to purchase its equipment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;australia&quot;&gt;Australia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-status-of-defense-exports-1&quot;&gt;Current Status of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to SIPRI data, during the 2017–21 period, Australia’s global share of defense equipment export value was only 0.6 percent, ranking it sixteenth in the world. However, compared to the 2011–16 five-year period, this value rose 97 percent, the third largest increase in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-of-defense-exports-1&quot;&gt;Background of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEFENSE EXPORT STRATEGY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia has a Defense Export Strategy dedicated to the export of defense equipment, which is rare. The 2018 strategy “builds on the 2016 Defence Industry Policy Statement by setting out a comprehensive system to plan, guide, and measure defense export outcomes.” It has four parts: (1) crafting a strategic approach to defense exports; (2) understanding the global defense market; (3) establishing the new defense export system; and (4) implementing defense export success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy notes that exports will boost future investment in Australia’s defense industry and create high-end manufacturing jobs. As it strives to make this industry stronger, more sustainable, and more globallycompetitive, the government has set five goals to reach by 2028:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“strengthen the partnership between the Australian Government and industry to pursue defence export opportunities;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;sustain Australia’s defence industrial capabilities across peaks and troughs in domestic demand;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;enable greater innovation and productivity in Australia’s defence industry to deliver world-leading Defence capabilities;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;maintain the capability edge of the Australian Defence Force and leverage Defence capability development for export opportunities; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;grow Australia’s defence industry to become a top ten global defence exporter.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy shows the government’s commitment to working with Australian companies to expand export opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUSTRALIA’S DEFENSE EXPORT PROMOTION AGENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian Defense Export Office (ADEO), established in April 2018 as part of the Defense Export Strategy, is the focal point for coordinating whole-of-government support for the Australian defense exports. ADEO is responsible for delivering the initiatives outlined in the Defense Export Strategy; working closely with an international network of defense attachés and business development managers in key markets; and engaging in G2G transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUSTRALIAN MILITARY SALES (AMS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the ADEO, the AMS office plans and executes G2G sales of matériel, sensitive technology, and services of the Australian defense industry. Its role is in “support[ing] Australian sovereign capability and military sales programs as well as promoting the Australian defence industry through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;International Government-to-Government sale, gifting or other transfer of surplus Australian Defence Force (ADF) articles&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;International Government-to-Government purchase of Australian origin, sensitive technology, and ADF articles&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supporting Australian defence industry to export to foreign government customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AMS office also publishes the Australian Defense Sales Catalogue, which provides information on ADF equipment and defense industry products and services sold to foreign governments. As part of these G2G transactions, surplus equipment is offered on an “as is, where is” basis, but new equipment can also be purchased. Prices may be specifically quoted or left to the market to decide, and payment is generally made in advance, but with flexibility in terms of delivery schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;comment-1&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Australia has prepared a strategy document specifically for defense equipment exports; based on this, Australia is using AMS, a type of standardized G2G transactions, to expand defense equipment exports. This AMS is similar to the U.S. FMS model and would be very helpful for Japan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;israel&quot;&gt;Israel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-status-of-defense-exports-2&quot;&gt;Current Status of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to SIPRI data, during the 2017–21 period, Israel’s global share of defense equipment export value was 2.4 percent, ranking it 10th in the world. However, this value decreased by 5.6 percent compared to the 2011–16 period. Nonetheless, Israel remains a major arms exporter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s economy depends heavily on defense-related exports. It has “extensive military relations with 130 countries that have been investing in Israel for decades through imports, exports, training and other security and military cooperation.” Increasingly, exports are going to Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific, areas of rapid military modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-of-defense-exports-2&quot;&gt;Background of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISRAEL’S DEFENSE EXPORT PROMOTION AGENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIBAT, the International Defense Cooperation directorate within Israel’s Ministry of Defense, maintains close ties with local defense companies, interfacing between industry and the defense establishment and staying on top of both technological developments and the operational needs of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). Its mandate includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“[Signing] Government-to-Government agreements&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initiating official foreign delegations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identifying business opportunities with Israeli defense industries&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding technological solutions for specific operational requirements&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establishing joint ventures&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conducting advanced training seminars&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Managing the sales of IDF inventory&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providing quality assurance &amp;amp; technical support services for G-to-G agreements&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providing in-depth information on Israel’s defense industry using a biennial directory&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Producing conferences; showcasing Israel’s technologies and capabilities under one roof at the Israel National Pavilion; attending global fairs &amp;amp; exhibitions and facilitating contact with participating industries”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROACTIVE UTILIZATION OF G2G TRANSACTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its limited resources compared to the United States, Israel excels at promoting G2G transactions that support exports by its small and medium-sized defense companies. The Israeli government recognizes that it cannot sustain its defense industry solely through domestic orders. As such, it has turned to G2G transactions to support its defense industrial base while still “preserving strategic autonomy and innovation potential.” By 2021, the value of G2G defense exports reached $3.365 billion, compared to $911 million in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel can export defense equipment through DCS under a government export license, but any exports that contain sensitive technology or are driven by national interests require the government to enter into a G2G arrangement with the purchasing country. For these large G2G deals, “the terms negotiated at a ministerial level enable both sides to reach agreements faster and at lower costs than commercial tender processes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The involvement of the Israeli government in arms sales benefits Israeli defense companies by allowing them to rely on the government in the event of trouble and benefits the purchasing country, which receives not only the equipment, but also education, training, and long-term maintenance by the IDF. Israeli G2G transactions differ from the U.S. FMS system in that the Israeli Ministry of Defense does not directly buy weapons from Israeli defense companies (such as Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Elbit Systems) and export them to purchasing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLEXIBLE DEFENSE EQUIPMENT EXPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel has adopted a flexible approach to arms exports and military assistance programs, using them to advance the country’s broader foreign policy objectives. It has supplied defense systems even to countries with human rights concerns, such as the Philippines under President Rodrigo Duterte and Myanmar, and to countries experiencing conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;comment-2&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Israel is promoting government-led equipment exports by making full use of G2G transactions, although not to the same extent as the U.S. FMS system. In addition, Israel’s experience in actual warfare and its flexible equipment exports are also contributing to the growth of its defense exports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;south-korea&quot;&gt;South Korea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-status-of-defense-exports-3&quot;&gt;Current Status of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to SIPRI data, during the 2017–2021 period, South Korea’s global share of defense equipment export value was 2.7 percent, ranking it eighth in the world. However, compared to the 2011–16 period, this value rose by 177 percent, the biggest increase of any country. South Korea’s arms exports have multiplied more than sixfold since 2005; in 2021 they exceeded imports for the first time. Beyond North America, regions targeted for exports now include Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-of-defense-exports-3&quot;&gt;Background of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOUTH KOREA’S DEFENSE EXPORT PROMOTION AGENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, a lack of transparency, dispersed organizational management, and insufficient management of financial resources in the existing acquisition system had led to inefficiency and weakened the competitiveness of the defense industry. As a result, as of January 1, 2006, the defense acquisition structures of eight different defense institutions — including the Ministry of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, each military branch and the Defense Procurement Agency — shut down, and these functions were brought under the new Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), an administrative center with the role of “improvement of defense capabilities, promotion of the defense industry, [and] procurement of munitions.” To make Korean defense exports more competitive, DAPA is also “designing regional strategies for strengthening export competitiveness and actively carrying out international cooperation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STRONG LEADERSHIP, UTILIZATION OF TOP SALESPEOPLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, the success or failure of policies to promote the domestic defense industry and proactively export equipment overseas have largely depended on the leadership of President Moon Jae-in, who served from 2017 to 22. The strength of South Korea’s equipment export project stems from the fact that under President Moon’s leadership, political leaders, the government, industry, and the military have come together under a unified structure. “Top sales,” in which the president directly pitches to other heads of state, are now commonplace, and defense industrial cooperation is often an important issue on the agenda during diplomacy with partner countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UTILIZATION OF NATIONAL DEFENSE DIPLOMACY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea has long used “defense diplomacy,” both passive forms such as military exchanges and cooperation and “active military diplomacy, such as political ties with allied countries or the deployment of military forces abroad at the request of allied nations or international organizations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea is using this defense diplomacy to sell equipment. For example, it deployed troops to Iraq from 2003 to 2008 and in December 2013 concluded a sales contract with Iraq for T-50 training aircraft, following the improvement of bilateral ties based on the reputation of the South Korean military there. In 2013, South Korea participated in typhoon relief efforts in the Philippines and held an event commemorating its participation in the Korean War, thereby establishing friendly relations and paving the way for a March 2014 contract to sell the Philippines FA-50 light attack aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CUSTOMIZED EXPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea is seizing commercial opportunities through “customized” exports based on meticulous market research. This sales approach “thoroughly examines the security environment, financial situation, and industrial structure of the customer and flexibly considers sales methods.” Sometimes, this results in “joint production with local companies, second-hand sales, and financial support,” tying negotiations to government economic assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UTILIZATION OF DCS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea does not use G2G transactions for defense sales. Given the country’s history of military coups, this is to avoid a public backlash against direct military involvement. The South Korean government has been limited to providing follow-up services such as training and maintenance after equipment sales, as it has done in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is expected that G2G transactions will be adopted in the future. That is why it is difficult for one company alone to promote exports, as defense trades are generally based on mutual trust between the governments involved. Since its establishment in 2006, DAPA has taken the role of directly selling defense articles as requested by a purchasing government. These kind of G2G transactions enable follow-on logistics support for an exported weapon system and serve as a starting point for secondary exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADVANTAGES FOR PURCHASING COUNTRIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s $15 billion defense acquisition framework agreement with Poland “could become Seoul’s most lucrative defense export package to date.” According to the Polish minister of national defense, the contract was concluded because of the excellent level of quality, speed of shipment, and of involvement of Polish industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, South Korea has supported defense exports with license production and technology transfer arrangements, including in Indonesia (amphibious vessels and submarines), Egypt, and India (K9 self-propelled howitzer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIGH DEFENSE R&amp;amp;D EXPENDITURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2022 fiscal year, South Korea had a high research and development (R&amp;amp;D) expenditure of approximately 400 billion yen ($3 billion), or 100 billion yen ($0.75 billion) more than Japan did. This high R&amp;amp;D investment is likely the reason behind the development of numerous competitive products such as the K9 artillery system and the FA-50 and T-50 aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;comment-3&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;South Korea has not yet introduced G2G transactions. However, under strong presidential leadership, DAPA has taken the lead in a whole-of-government approach to defense exports, which have been increasing at a breakneck pace as a result. This trend is due not only to the cost performance of the equipment, but also to the other promotions included in the sales package. The introduction of G2G transactions will make it easier for South Korean companies to participate in equipment exports, as they will be guaranteed by the government.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;germany&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-status-of-defense-exports-4&quot;&gt;Current Status of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to SIPRI data, in the 2017–2021 period, Germany’s global share of defense-equipment export value was 4.5 percent, ranking it fifth in the world. However, compared to the 2011–16 period, this value fell by 19 percent. Nonetheless, German arms exports hit a new record in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-of-defense-exports-4&quot;&gt;Background of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UTILIZATION OF DCS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany also does not use G2G transactions for defense sales, given the nation’s history during World War II and public concerns over the direct involvement of the military. However, the German government certainly provides support for such exports. For example, it backs sales of German submarines and tanks with training by the German armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STRONG DEFENSE INDUSTRY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany has traditionally been a manufacturing powerhouse, with its products known for their high quality and reliability. This is also true for defense systems: the Leopard 2 tank is highly valued by various countries, and conventional submarines of German design are in service throughout the world. The efficiency and competitiveness of its defense industry places Germany in a very favorable position in the international market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPORT POLICY BECOMING MORE FLEXIBLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German arms-export policy is governed by EU law (such as Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP of December 8, 2008, which sets criteria for member states to use in issuing export licenses), the German Constitution (in particular, Article 26 (2) of the Basic Law, which requires licenses for all manufacture, transportation, and distribution of weapons), other national laws (including the War Weapons Control Act, the Foreign Trade and Payments Act, the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance), and the Political Principles of the Federal Government for the Export of War Weapons and Other Military Equipment. Exports are strictly controlled by export licenses issued in accordance with these regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany’s legal framework has made it difficult to directly export defense equipment to countries with human rights violations. However, according to the Bonn International Center for Conversion (BICC), “in 2019, Germany approved arms exports to 55 states whose human rights situation were classified as ‘very poor.’” Germany’s Enable &amp;amp; Enhance Initiative allows for the export of dual-use technologies to support crisis management and post-conflict and peace-building operations, generally destined for countries considered unstable. In addition, German companies are increasingly relocating production of defense equipment abroad and then exporting to third countries via subsidiaries to circumvent arms-export regulations. Further, German companies also are allowed to support the development of defense industrial capacity abroad in less sensitive defense fields, which also facilitates the international production of defense equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to complying with the letter of EU and other international agreements, Germany has generally avoided exporting arms to parties to a conflict. However, Germany recently reversed this long-standing policy to provide Ukraine with defensive weapons. This may set a precedent for future defense exports to warring countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;comment-4&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Germany has not adopted formal G2G transactions for defense exports. In part due to negative popular views on the arms trade, Germany has generally followed strict arms-export rules. However, even with these strict restrictions, “loophole-like practices” have been expanding under the guise of contributing to international peace. Germany is also expanding its arms exports due to the capabilities of its outstanding defense industry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Models for Government Support of Defense Equipment Exports.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: Each of the major arms-exporting countries examined above has been categorized based solely on the author’s individual opinion. Practices of a country may overlap in more than one category. The categories listed reflect increasing levels of government involvement and guarantees; they may overlap on detailed points but reflect an evolution in favor of government involvement in defense equipment exports. The degree of government involvement does not depend on G2G contracts (for example, South Korea has become a heavy promoter of defense exports even though it exclusively uses DCS). Source: Author’s research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-for-japan&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations for Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the export-promotion strategies of these major exporters of defense equipment, this paper presents eight recommendations — listed in order of priority — for expanding Japan’s own such exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-utilize-g2g-transactions-make-the-japanese-government-a-contracting-party&quot;&gt;1. Utilize G2G Transactions (Make the Japanese Government a Contracting Party)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy of promoting overseas exports of defense equipment under national leadership is clearly stated in the new Defense Buildup Plan, to which the government should make a firm commitment. Even if Japan does not introduce an FMS system like that of the United States (or France), where the government is more involved, it should utilize G2G transactions and become a contracting party negotiating directly with the government of the purchasing country. (The 2020 transfer of air surveillance radar systems to the Philippines was not a G2G transaction as defined in this report because the contract itself was between Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and the Philippine Air Force.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the defense industry, both supplier and purchasing governments are involved to varying degrees. In such a unique market, it would be unreasonable for Japanese defense companies to negotiate with the government of the purchasing country. Negotiations under G2G transactions would reduce this burden for Japanese defense companies and allow them to concentrate on improving their performance, such as by engaging with companies in the purchasing country — as neither government nor industry talks will work without the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, it is common in the defense market for the purchasing country to insist on offset conditions. Since negotiations on these may extend beyond the defense industry, government involvement would benefit both suppliers and purchasers. It would also facilitate sales because the government will be providing a sense of security by endorsing the defense equipment being exported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G2G transactions also make it relatively easy to sell associated services. In the case of the F-35, for example, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries hosts the maintenance, repair, overhaul, and upgrade depot for the Indo-Pacific region. Similarly, Japan should do the maintenance of F-15s, U.S. fighter jets deployed by other Asian countries. It is difficult to transport the engines to the United States every time to conduct maintenance. The only Asian countries that can service the engines of fighter jets are Japan, South Korea, and Australia, so selling this service would be profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-establish-a-new-equipment-export-promotion-agency&quot;&gt;2. Establish a New Equipment Export Promotion Agency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new specialized agency in charge of G2G transactions for defense equipment exports should be established within the Japanese government akin to South Korea’s DAPA, France’s DI, or Israel’s SIBAT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the export of defense equipment involves various government bodies such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA); Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI); MOD; the Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Agency (ATLA); and the National Security Secretariat (NSS) in the prime minister’s office, it would be most effective to place export authority under an interagency organization such as NSS. This would help overcome stovepiping and bureaucratic rivalries among government agencies. Housing such an agency under the NSS would also give the public the impression of a whole-of-government approach like South Korea’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new export promotion agency should create a Japanese Defense Export Strategy like Australia’s. This would help explain the strategy to the Japanese public, which is still resistant to exporting defense equipment, and gain support from the defense industry and other government sectors. The new agency should also draw on private sector businesses experienced in defense transactions, such as trading companies. As evidenced by the failure of Japan’s attempt to export Soryu submarines to Australia in 2016, close coordination with the defense industry is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-strengthen-rd-related-to-security&quot;&gt;3. Strengthen R&amp;amp;D Related to Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, defense R&amp;amp;D expenditures in Japan were limited. However, in the proposed 2023 budget, defense R&amp;amp;D expenditures rose significantly to 896.8 billion yen, a threefold increase from the previous fiscal year. While this is commendable, the government should further strengthen support for technology research. This could include establishing a defense-focused think tank that can ask industry to carry out technological research based on a clear definition of requirements and attendant capabilities for defense operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also essential to have an R&amp;amp;D hub inside the government. For example, MOD, METI, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) are working to create a joint research institute to develop quantum and cyber-related technologies with national security applications. Since MOD lacks enough personnel with the expertise to identify important civilian technologies, it benefits from coordinating with METI and MIC, which are more familiar with these technologies and their potential military applications. One engineer from the private sector called for the government to inject 1 trillion yen in funds every year for research that these officials can conduct at their own discretion, noting that, “If the government takes the initiative with a budget, we [engineers] would do anything.” Japan is generally praised for engineering capacity that generates advanced capacities, but it lacks a mechanism for applying such ingenuity to the realm of security. In contrast to industrial policy, where fear of failure often leads to risk aversion, it will be important to encourage taking risks in defense technology research and accept failure even when large amounts of money are allocated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a country with no recent combat experience, the development of defense equipment using cutting-edge technology will help Japanese industry become more internationally competitive. Japan’s new National Defense Strategy states that “Japan will establish a new research institution in MOD to find multi-use cutting-edge technologies that contribute to defense equipment development, and to produce equipment that leads to defense innovation.” This should be an urgent priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-promote-deregulation&quot;&gt;4. Promote Deregulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since export criteria should be transparent and supportive of Japanese industry, the Three Principles for arms exports should be further revised to clarify the government’s strategy and criteria for defense equipment exports. Currently, the government can make exceptions on a case-by-case basis, but the principles do not include a transparent process for Japanese defense companies to follow. For example, current rules state that fighter aircraft cannot be exported to countries not involved in their joint development, but this should be made possible to support the defense industrial base. Not counting international joint development and production, equipment considered for transfers is essentially limited to five categories of use (rescue, transportation, warning, surveillance, and minesweeping).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, under the current policy, defense equipment cannot be transferred to a country engaged in conflict, but countries responding to aggression — such as Ukraine — should be able to receive support from Japan. As mentioned above, Germany, France, Israel, and other countries have increased their sales partly by exporting defense equipment to parties involved in conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Three Principles note that “prior to overseas transfer of defense equipment and technology, the Government will in principle oblige the Government of the recipient country to gain its prior consent regarding extra-purpose use and transfer to third parties in order to ensure appropriate control of the defense equipment and technology after the overseas transfer.” Japan should make this policy more flexible by giving purchasing countries the responsibility for overseeing their use for other purposes. As mentioned above, South Korea allows purchasing countries to resell equipment to other buyers without approval, an approach that has increased sales. Japan should establish an efficient process for reviewing transfer requests and relax requirements for end users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s new National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy state that the Three Principles, their implementation guidelines, and other procedures should be revised to promote the smooth transfer of defense equipment and technology and international joint development in a broad array of fields. Deregulation and flexibility will prove critical in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-encourage-low-interest-government-loans&quot;&gt;5. Encourage Low-Interest Government Loans&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the international defense market, it is common for developing countries to request low-interest loans as a condition of purchase. However, since private financial institutions are often unable to agree on interest rates and other terms, these purchases are sometimes abandoned. The Japanese government should provide low-interest loans to developing countries — perhaps modeled on those of Bpifrance — to increase defense equipment exports. Japan could encourage its defense companies to use the government-funded Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) system, which provides insurance for high-risk overseas transactions that are not covered by private insurance companies, to support financing for defense equipment exports to developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s new National Defense Strategy states that “Japan will carry forward with the transfer of defense equipment and technology in the joint public and private efforts by establishing a fund, and implementing measures including providing corporate assistance as necessary to smoothly promote such transfers.” Such efforts should also prioritize supporting developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-utilize-high-level-government-representation&quot;&gt;6. Utilize High-Level Government Representation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan should consider adopting the “top sales” model used by South Korea and various European countries. Staff from the proposed defense equipment export agency could accompany the prime minister on overseas trips to actively promote defense products. The ministers of foreign affairs; defense; and economy, trade, and industry should do the same when they travel abroad, as should officials from other relevant agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan should also exercise defense diplomacy. This does not mean that Japan should actively participate in conflicts (which is constitutionally prohibited) but that it could take advantage of its involvement in UN-led and other multinational peacekeeping operations to promote its defense equipment. For example, outdoor bathing systems, water supply vehicles, and water purification vehicles used for disaster relief could prove attractive, as could Japan’s expertise in de-mining using its Type 92 Mine Rollers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export promotion should also be assigned to Japanese defense attachés and other embassy staff (e.g., defense teams) stationed overseas. (These same offices will also need to be strengthened to enable more effective management of Japanese defense procurement.) It will be important to designate a point of contact in charge of defense exports within Japanese embassies or other government institutions, as Japanese defense companies sometimes do not know with whom to talk about defense equipment exports. These officials should also be tasked with gathering information on host-nation defense requirements that would be suitable for Japanese exports. Efforts should initially focus on researching the demand for Japanese equipment in Southeast Asian countries, which is important for countering China in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;7-encourage-corporate-restructuring&quot;&gt;7. Encourage Corporate Restructuring&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the end of the Cold War, many Western countries reduced their defense budgets, leading to widespread consolidation and restructuring of related industries. However, in Japan, there has been no integration and restructuring among defense contractors. Consolidating and integrating major firms like MHI and Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) would be difficult, but this approach could prove successful for smaller companies. In the future, Japan should seek to consolidate major defense contractors into companies that are not just departments within large corporations. In other words, Japan should create companies more like Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, Diehl Defence, and Saab AB — whose work is primarily focused on defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production of ammunition provides a good example of Japan’s dilemma: “A rifle cartridge consists of a bullet, a shell casing, an ammunition belt, and a primer. Each of these is manufactured by a different company. Of course, the gunpowder is [manufactured by] another company.” If any one company in this inefficient supply chain fails, the manufacture of ammunition is delayed. It seems possible to integrate and reorganize these companies or have them be incorporated into major firms such as MHI and KHI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;8-champion-two-way-flows-of-investment&quot;&gt;8. Champion Two-Way Flows of Investment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help the Japanese defense industry, the government should promote collaboration with foreign companies that have international expertise, starting with small components and then gradually transitioning to larger systems. In this context, it is important that there be two-way flows of investment with foreign partners in the defense industry. For example, foreign defense manufacturers should be allowed to invest in Japanese defense companies — which, in turn, should be able to work with international partners on projects beyond those commissioned by the JSDF. Realizing this objective will require a marketing license process, which would enable Japan’s defense industry to engage potential international partners beyond the country’s existing joint defense programs. The Japanese government should learn from the U.S. Department of State’s efforts to support the activities of defense companies by clarifying the DSP-5 marketing license process. Without such measures, Japan’s defense industry will never be competitive and defense exports will remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A whole-of-government strategy is needed in order for Japan to better promote defense equipment exports. This export strategy should include measures to manage export controls and information security; create an export-promotion agency; strengthen government expertise and representation overseas; and promote not only exports but also support services. In addition, Japan’s defense industry cannot remain passive and should engage with the international community through marketing, joint R&amp;amp;D, and overseas investment activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measures should be modest at first, focusing on a realistic level of support for defense equipment export activities before expanding as the capabilities and experience of the Japanese government and defense industry develop. At some point, the government will also have to consider introducing a Japanese version of FMS and restructuring the defense industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xppo6ux.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（12日）踏入審訊第41天。控方今披露本案「共謀者」名單，除早前提及的時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻和民主動力總幹事黎敬輝，亦包括時任公民黨立法會議員郭榮鏗。趙家賢亦被法官問及何為「五大訴求」，他回答時多番猶豫和斷斷續續，並稱《逃犯條例》修訂草案於2019年6月被政府撤回，有被告驚訝發笑。趙家賢早上完成主問，並由代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大狀黃宇逸盤問，趙形容鄭達鴻「好勤力」，不會視他為「本土抗爭派」，辯方並稱公民黨在《國安法》生效後，曾要求將政綱修訂為「無字政綱」，趙對此無印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指郭榮鏗為共謀者-曾在公民黨記者會發言&quot;&gt;控方指郭榮鏗為「共謀者」 曾在公民黨記者會發言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方早前指控曾參與九龍東協調的時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻，以及民主動力總幹事黎敬輝均為本案「共謀者」（co-conspirator）之一，惟二人均沒有被捕和被起訴、名字亦不在公訴書（indictment）上，法官認為情況不理想，籲控方提供一份共謀者名單。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bwo6QT3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪今交代除二人外，亦指控已離港的時任公民黨立法會議員郭榮鏗為「共謀者」，並已向辯方提交「共謀者原則」下針對各被告的修訂證據列表。根據該原則，各共謀者的言行均可用來指證所有被告。法官李運騰問，郭榮鏗有什麼發言和行為，萬德豪指他曾在公民黨記者會發言。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，郭榮鏗並沒有參與初選，亦沒有就本案被捕及被起訴。而公民黨曾於2020年3月25日召開「全面進攻 議會過半 實現五大訴求」記者會，會上楊岳橋表明若政府不回應五大訴求，公民黨會否決財政預算案；郭榮鏗亦稱民主派需團結才能履行真正憲制責任，監督及制衡政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱曾被眾籌平台拒絕-後改找gogetfunding&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱曾被眾籌平台拒絕 後改找「GoGetFunding」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦展示名為「2020 年立法會選舉－民主派35+公民投票 群眾集資！」的「GoGetFunding」文件，提及公民投票的背景。趙稱因他不熟悉眾籌事宜，故由民主動力總幹事和職員負責撰寫相關資料，在眾籌網頁展示。他又透露原本曾找另一眾籌平台負責，「但之後佢就唔肯做」，故改為找「GoGetFunding」的平台。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;工作報告寫民動3月開始協助初選-趙稱僅列席會議報告為簡單描述&quot;&gt;工作報告寫民動3月開始協助初選 趙稱僅列席會議、報告為「簡單描述」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示民主動力2019至2020年的工作報告，當中提及民主動力於2020年3月19日曾發布帖文「回應有關立法會協調工作及民間要求初選安排的意見」，指趙家賢和總幹事獲區諾軒及黃大仙和觀塘區議會正副主席邀請，參與多次九龍東協調會議，在戴耀廷主持下結論九東可採取「棄選」機制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;該工作報告亦有章節以「獲委託承辦民主派35+公民投票」為題，提及「2020年3月開始，戴耀廷副教授及區諾軒前立法會議員主導，民主動力協助，各區議會民主派正副主席主持，以『團結一致，立會過半』為目標，與民主派人士於各區進行協調會議。最終民主派人士達成協議共識，一致決定舉行『民主派35+公民投票』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢確認描述正確。趙早前曾供稱民主動力於5月才正式答應承辦初選，法官陳仲衡提到，文件提及民主動力於2020年3月已協助初選？趙回應，民主動力在3月有獲邀列席協調會議，就辦初選的技術範疇等表達意見，而報告的句子「唔係一個好長嘅句子」，「所以就用咗『協助』呢個簡單描述」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問五大訴求-趙多番猶豫始回答-稱逃犯條例於2019年6月獲撤回&quot;&gt;官問五大訴求 趙多番猶豫始回答 稱《逃犯條例》於2019年6月獲撤回&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪表示完成主問，法官陳慶偉續問趙，以他理解「五大訴求」是什麼？趙低頭思考約10秒，再低聲說「撤回呢個逃犯條例，然後就係……成立由法官主持嘅獨立調查委員會去調查整個事件」。陳慶偉問是什麼事件，趙稱是整個反修例運動，即為何會有民怨及後續的衝突事件。至於餘下訴求，趙思考一會指包括「釋放被捕人士同埋係可以撤銷控罪」，其後再指「然後就係……erm……係……要求……要求呢個雙普選盡快推動……同埋係取消612嘅暴動定性」。余慧明聞言搖頭嘆氣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，趙家賢是否記得《逃犯條例》何時撤回？趙再靜默約5秒稱「喺（2019年）6月底左右嘅時間」，余慧明面露驚訝發笑。趙指，6月12日後中國駐英大使表示《逃犯條例》修訂並非國家中央的要求，「而係香港地區自行提出」，而政府其後於2019年6月撤回《逃犯條例》修訂草案，趙指當時行政長官用「唔太確認嘅字眼」，令民怨繼續積累。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，趙是否同意至2020年3月，撤回《逃犯條例》已不再重要（non-issue）？趙指「技術上係」。李再問，即使《逃犯條例》已撤回，反對政府或對政府不滿的人，是否仍不會感滿足？趙同意，解釋「五大訴求」後有「缺一不可」，意思就是「綑綁式」，「一定係幾個元素都係要符合到市民想要求嘅嘢，大家先會收貨」，並同意截至現時為止，其餘四項訴求均未有實現。翻查資料，時任行政長官林鄭月娥於2019年6月15日宣布「暫緩」修例，至9月才正式宣布「撤回」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢自2013年認識鄭達鴻於區議會共事多年-不視鄭為本土抗爭派&quot;&gt;趙家賢自2013年認識鄭達鴻、於區議會共事多年 不視鄭為本土抗爭派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後由代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大律師黃宇逸進行盤問。趙家賢確認，自2013年起認識鄭達鴻，當時趙是東區區議員，鄭是公民黨地區發展主任，鄭並於2015年當選東區（丹拿）區議員，二人在不同委員會事務、地區工作和海濱發展等合作，曾跟進擴建東區醫院和發展東區行人板道等項目。趙同意，鄭作為區議員集中於民生議題，形容他「好勤力」。法官陳仲衡一度反問那不正是區議員的工作本質？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，知道鄭達鴻2018年取得法學博士學位，而他和鄭均於2019年連任東區區議員，鄭任規劃工程及房屋事務委員會主席，二人亦同屬康體藝術文化發展工作小組。黃宇逸續引報導指該文化小組曾申請20萬辦「東區足球隊」，惟法官指與案無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙其後在法官陳仲衡詢問下確認，不認為鄭達鴻是本土抗爭派，並在辯方追問下同意視鄭達鴻為傳統民主派。趙曾供稱2019年區選後本土派令地區事務政治化，惟他在盤問下確認，他和鄭2019年後於區議會通過撥款時，「係會經過思考去理性嘅處理」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指國安法生效後公民黨要求將政綱修訂為無字政綱-趙無印象&quot;&gt;辯方指《國安法》生效後公民黨要求將政綱修訂為「無字政綱」 趙無印象&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;民主動力負責收集初選提名表格，趙家賢指收集表格的電郵是由職員和秘書處處理，他沒有登入權限，但職員會向他「綜合性」匯報收到多少份提名表格。黃宇逸續問，《國安法》生效後，趙是否得悉公民黨曾要求修改政綱？趙指當時同事有向他匯報各候選人情況，籠統地提及有政黨參選人要修改政綱，但沒指明哪個政黨。黃續指，公民黨是要求將政綱換成「無字政綱」，趙不解問「無字政綱」意思是什麼，陳慶偉指應是空白的政綱，問趙當時是否知悉。趙指「多謝法官閣下提點」，並指記得同事稱有政黨本來政綱空白，其後再呈交政綱望更新，即與黃所說的情況相反。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，趙是何時獲告知該情況？趙指「冇乜太大印象」，僅稱6月24日公布提名名單後一星期，仍有進行修改更新。李續問，提名表格是否會連同政綱一同繳交？趙指當時有選舉團體交了提名表格後，要求遲數天或一星期才補交政綱，解釋民間選舉可以「彈性處理」。被問收到政綱後會如何處理，趙稱會將參選人資料和政綱張貼在票站外，讓選民投票前查閱，並指提名期完結後，總幹事黎敬輝曾將所有初選參選人的政綱上載至Google雲端硬碟並公開連結，他曾載入該連結簡單查看，但沒有深究鄭達鴻政綱內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（12日）踏入審訊第41天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢今接受盤問，重申戴耀廷在民主動力未答允辦初選時聲稱已邀請民動，令與會者產生期望，民動若不答應「唔單止中晒箭」，亦會因期望落差太大而構成無形壓力，形容戴很多時「夾硬嚟」、「順住個勢」令人按其意願做事。趙又同意，雖初選提名表格「支持協調會議共識」的條款寫法「籠統」，惟各區否決預算案的共識仍然存在，又形容是予不同光譜人士「彈性」向支持者和黨內人士交代。此外，趙指曾與鄭達鴻在區議會共事數年，形容他很細心和理性討論政策，不確定他是否一定會否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意35計劃目標籠統fb帖文無提五大訴求為目標&quot;&gt;趙同意「35+計劃」目標「籠統」、FB帖文無提「五大訴求」為目標&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢續接受代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大律師黃宇逸盤問。趙曾在2021年6月21日的錄影會面紀錄中形容，初選提名表格要求確認支持協調會議共識的條款寫法「籠統」，黃問趙是否認為「35+計劃」的目標是「籠統」？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續展示趙2020年6月9日的Facebook帖文，指「35+計劃」目標如下：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;增加民主派在立法會選舉地區直選及功能界別所獲的議席&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;民主派取得地區直選及功能界別的議席超過35個（35+），合計過半&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;民主派奪取全體投票的主導權，即立法會的完全控制權&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意上述3點是「35+計劃」目標，惟法官李運騰質疑，這3點不包括於各區協議都列明的「五大訴求，缺一不可」。趙同意，解釋帖文只是複製民主動力的Facebook帖文，「即係一雞兩味咁用法」，亦非由他所撰寫，他不太知道為何不包括「五大訴求」。趙其後同意帖文背景有提及「五大訴求」，亦確認發文前同意內容，指「我發咗出嚟我要負責嘅」，並補充帖文只是宣傳初選、讓公眾知道方向。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱條款雖籠統但否決預算案共識仍存在-指予彈性向支持者交代&quot;&gt;趙稱條款雖「籠統」但否決預算案共識仍存在 指予「彈性」向支持者交代&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就初選提名表格的第二項條款「支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識」，黃宇逸問，共識是否不包括參選人在當選後須否決預算案？趙回答字眼雖「籠統」，但「各個區嘅共識係存在嘅」。陳慶偉續問，是否即使表格字眼籠統，就運用否決權的字眼亦有不同，但協調會議就運用否決權已達成共識？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢昨亦形容，該條款如「九二共識」，「一個中國，各自表述」，本土派和傳統民主派可各有解讀。黃宇逸再問，是否即該條款不代表參選人一旦當選，必須否決預算案？趙解釋因各區協議字眼不同，部分為「會積極運用」否決權，部分為「會運用」，而該提名表格是五個地方選區均會用到，「我冇理由喺表格度咁仔細去寫」。法官李運騰問，故如何理解該條款，仍是取決於本土派和傳統民主派各自的詮釋？趙指應是說「有多少少彈性，係比唔同政治光譜嘅人士，去同支持者或者係黨內嘅人士做一個交代」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確信戴耀廷發送的協調文件為最終版本無組織者稱文件不準確&quot;&gt;趙確信戴耀廷發送的協調文件為最終版本、無組織者稱文件不準確&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，從戴耀廷口中得知各區會議已達成共識，但部分選區只去過頭一次會議，包括新界東。黃宇逸續問，因此當戴稱各區已達成共識，趙不會知道其說法是否屬實？趙稱2020年6月8日，即召開初選記者會前一天，他曾在組織者群組要求戴將所有協調會議的最後協議版本發送出來，同在群組的區諾軒亦收到。趙續指，其後「墨落無悔」聲明出現，群組就此討論，趙曾回應「雖然份嘢冇白紙黑字簽，但當時嚟講都係mutually agreed 的 consent」，而戴耀廷或區諾軒均無否定其說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，他曾問區諾軒各區會議的情況，區指他不是所有會議有出席或留到最尾，「其實跟得最足都係戴耀廷，你問返佢啦」。因此趙認為在當時他認知的訊息下，確信戴耀廷發出的是最終協調版本。他並確認，戴有出席所有協調會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;組織者群組成員包括戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及黎敬輝，李運騰續問，趙有否聽過群組有人提出戴發送的文件並不準確？趙表示沒有。黃宇逸問到，但趙不能確定該些文件代表參選人的意見？惟陳慶偉指趙無法回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙批戴耀廷夾硬嚟-民動未允辦初選已告知與會者製造壓力&quot;&gt;趙批戴耀廷「夾硬嚟」 民動未允辦初選已告知與會者、製造壓力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃宇逸續展示趙家賢與黎敬輝的WhatsApp對話，趙曾於5月5日提醒黎「特別留意Benny點樣講民動個角色」，並稱「佢（戴耀廷）啲嘢真係成日都亂咁嚟」，在延伸庭的黃之鋒、岑敖暉及袁嘉蔚均發笑，黃之鋒及岑敖暉其後亦大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃問趙為何會對戴有此印象，趙表示過往與戴耀廷在民主運動上的很多溝通、或一些活動的推行令他有此感覺，並指戴邀請民主動力幫忙辦初選時，他回應需要思考、未能夠答應，但戴已在會上向與會者表示「邀請咗民主動力去幫手做個初選啦」。趙批戴「唔講事實嘅後半段」，令很多與會者以為民主動力已經肯幫手和會幫手、亦有此期望，惟趙指，「如果我哋民主動力真係考慮過之後，真係不會幫手嘅話，咁其實就唔單止中晒箭啦，因為期望落差太大，根本無形中已經造咗一個壓力出嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，「變咗好多時佢（戴）想人哋做某啲嘢，但嗰啲人未必應承呢，佢就會用類似嘅方法，叫做夾硬嚟又好，或者順住個勢，結果都係要按佢需要而進行」。法官李運騰問，戴是否製造令人難以拒絕的情況，迫使人接受他想做的事，趙同意，並重申「我直情係採取一個好困擾嘅迴避態度對佢咁解」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱落口供時記錯-澄清無出席第二次新東會議-指首次會議莊榮輝稱不獲民主黨授權&quot;&gt;趙稱落口供時記錯 澄清無出席第二次新東會議 指首次會議莊榮輝稱不獲民主黨授權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃宇逸續就新界東會議情況發問，問趙是否得知民主黨代表莊榮輝，曾在5月5日第二次新東協調會議上，稱不獲授權處理是否同意否決預算案。惟法官指趙沒有出席該次會議，對此沒有個人認知。辯方續展示趙於2022年9月錄取的首份書面供詞，提及他曾出席第二次新東會議，並指鄒家成會上提出「一定要否決財政預算案」以迫使政府回應「五大訴求」，但當時仍未能達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問他是否有出席該次會議，趙指錄取口供時記錯了會議日期，重申就新界東只出席了4月14日的第一次會議，並指首次會議民主黨代表是莊榮輝，而第二次會議獲助手黎敬輝告知，民主黨代表為李永成。趙續指，記得莊榮輝會上曾提及他沒有獲民主黨授權，李運騰問他是在第一次會議、而非第二次會議聽到？趙說「係，冇錯，我親耳聽到，親眼見到」，說時以右手指着自己的右耳和右眼示意，鄒家成發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴耀廷主持首次新東會議-區諾軒為協助角色&quot;&gt;趙稱戴耀廷主持首次新東會議 區諾軒為協助角色&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示黎敬輝就首次新東會議的重點筆記，提及「程張迎、羅永德、Ben（鍾錦麟）、Benny（戴耀廷）、區諾軒主持」。趙確認當日遲到會議，到場時上述人士坐在主席台位置，並觀察到由戴耀廷主要發言和主持會議，區諾軒作為主持的一部分，但屬「協助」角色。李運騰續問會上有否社民連的代表，趙稱有代表，但不記得是誰，亦確認梁國雄不在場，其後據紀錄確認吳文遠和岑子杰在場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，組織者無就會議點名或作出席紀錄，但戴耀廷曾邀參與者輪流自我介紹，不過他同意有參與者遲到早退。黃宇逸問趙曾否確認黎敬輝的出席者名單是準確，趙指他當晚有出席，記錄上大致也是有出席的人。法官陳仲衡一度指，問證人有否確認出席者身分是「非常愚蠢的問題」，着黃善用時間；李運騰亦指若辯方望指出有不在紀錄的人出席，可直接指出，黃稱留待另一證人才發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎敬輝無記錄否決權用字爭議-趙稱因他已在場聽到着黎不用記&quot;&gt;黎敬輝無記錄否決權用字爭議 趙稱因他已在場聽到着黎不用記&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就否決預算案的討論，趙重申會上有人提及支持戴耀廷在《蘋果日報》文章的看法，戴遂以「好溫和」字眼講解，會上並就「會運用」和「會積極運用」字眼討論。趙形容，「呢方面係有少少嘅火花衝突喺度，因為鄒家成有提過要『chur盡』，就係我一定會運用（否決權）咁嘅意思」，而林卓廷代表莊榮輝則質疑是否「起學校醫院都反對」。趙並指，在首次會議「我好記得就係冇任何投票」，因民主黨代表表明不獲授權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，黎敬輝的筆記是快速的重點紀錄，若就某些議題有很詳細討論，「當然唔會寫咗落去」，而是會記錄討論後的重點。李運騰續指，趙家賢稱莊榮輝提及不獲授權投票，但黎卻沒有記錄，趙指「因為我當時有同黎敬輝講呢個位唔洗啦，我啱啱聽完啦」，被告席傳來「嘩」，鄒家成亦發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃宇逸其後亦問，若鄒家成倡用「會運用」字眼，黎應會作為要點記下？趙重申當時以電腦處理區議會事務，至戴耀廷講解文章和否決權字眼的討論，他有抬起頭專心聽，爭議完後就向黎表示：「其他開會啲重點你 mark 低啦，咁但就住啱啱嗰個有火花嘅開會嘅情況呢，我都知道晒，咁得啦唔洗 mark 啦」，鄒家成再發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續問，是否記得社民連代表會上稱不能同意否決預算案，因若有全民退保，社民連會贊成。趙稱只記得社民連代表稱會支持全民退保，但沒有詳細記憶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;新東會上數度提共同綱領-趙稱無人反對制訂&quot;&gt;新東會上數度提共同綱領 趙稱無人反對制訂&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰其後就黎敬輝紀錄發問，引述吳文遠曾稱「大家可制訂共同綱領」、將軍澳青年力量稱「必須有共同綱領」、戴耀廷亦稱「共同綱領原則是否決預算案，迫政府解散立法會，今次任期可能只有七個月」。趙確認會上有聽到該些說法，並指吳並非用「共同綱領」字眼，而是指「整一份大家一齊同意嘅嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問戴是否嘗試總結會議內容，趙認為他「有少少係總結咗部分人嘅意思」，並指戴本身有此倡議，而會上亦有人要求運用否決權。李續問，紀錄有至少3處提及「共同綱領」，當時有沒有人反對制訂共同綱領？趙指沒有，僅莊榮輝稱不獲授權處理。他亦同意，會議筆記並非逐字記錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指戴耀廷曾稱會將所有協議發給參選人-同意港島共識投1票惟協議稱投4票是錯誤&quot;&gt;趙指戴耀廷曾稱會將所有協議發給參選人 同意港島共識投1票惟協議稱投4票是「錯誤」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃宇逸續就港島會議發問。被問趙是否不知道戴有否將「35+港島final」文件私下發給港島參選人，趙表示戴曾向他稱，會將所有文件的草擬和最終版發給參選人和團隊；又指曾問一名男參選人，對方表示收到戴耀廷的文件。黃一度問趙有否問鄭達鴻，並問趙是否不知事實上所有港島參選人都有收到文件，但遭法官陳慶偉打斷並着他「請聰明一些（please be smart）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續同意，於5月底得知港島區由投4票改為投1票，指各區的投票系統均要統一。黃續展示港島協調機制協議，有條款提及「以全票制選出他支持的四張名單」，問是否與港島最後共識不吻合，趙同意，亦同意陳慶偉指，若文件由戴耀廷準備，那戴是出錯（wrong）。惟他同意，無收到任何人向他或組織者提出協議字眼與共識不一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指鄭達鴻細心理性審視政策-不肯定是否必定否決預算案&quot;&gt;趙指鄭達鴻細心理性審視政策 不肯定是否必定否決預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢昨亦供稱，戴耀廷2020年8月底曾提議為香港民研預留款項研發全民投票系統，進行有關否決預算案的民調，因關注傳統民主派對運用否決權有保留。黃宇逸問到，即直至2020年8月尾，傳統民主派對無差別否決預算案仍未有共識？趙回應指7月底政府宣布押後選舉，「但大家傾嘅嘢冇特別改變」；而戴望建立新系統就否決預算案進行民調，是因他感受到傳統民主派一旦進入立法會，或不如他規劃般否決預算案，而他想整個民主派一起團結否決。趙強調，戴「有一個自己對於嚟緊事態發展的推測及分析」，他亦同意陳慶偉所指，戴是想鞏固（reinforce）自己的計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續問，趙是否不知道鄭達鴻有沒有同意過一旦當選，將無差別否決預算案。趙指鄭在區議會是其同事，大家共事好幾年，「佢審視唔同嘅政府議題政策呢，係會好細心同埋係好理性去討論嘅，所以如果淨係講佢個人嘅話，我係唔能夠知道佢入到去係咪一定會否決財政預算案」。惟法官陳仲衡提到，本案關鍵並非被告會否實際上無差別否決預算案，而是他是否同意參與一個有人會無差別否決預算案的謀劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱黎敬輝獲賦權代表民主動力&quot;&gt;趙稱黎敬輝獲賦權代表民主動力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，辯方亦就時任民主動力總幹事黎敬輝發問，趙確認其工作性質主要是行政。黃宇逸問，黎敬輝並非「35+」組織者之一？趙稱「依個問題好難」，黃續問黎在會議角色是否僅限於抄筆記，李運騰補充即問黎敬輝是僅在場抄筆記，抑或代表民主動力出席？趙指「多謝法官閣下 rephrase 過條問題」，並指黎除了是「行政首長」，亦獲賦權代表民主動力，只是不能控制人們如何判斷他說話的比重。他並確認，黎大致上沒有參與會上的討論，但有時談及初選的行政工作或經驗而趙家賢不在場時，黎會幫手講解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4H8ve3C.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（12日）踏入審訊第41天。趙家賢接受代表吳政亨的大狀盤問，庭上展示新界東群組對話，其中認罪被告、控方證人林景楠曾轉發「三投三不投」的《蘋果日報》頭版廣告，批評廣告「內容很多問題」，以紅色做底色「好嘔心」，又問圖中「藍色物體是否媽咪麵個friend？」，戴耀廷則回應廣告由民間團體刊登，「與初選無直接關係」。趙確認，事前不知悉該廣告，而戴耀廷亦曾向他承諾「三投三不投」與初選大會無關。被問「三投三不投」是否並非「35+計劃」一部分，趙表示：「我只可以回應同民主動力同我本人同區諾軒無關。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認吳政亨無出席組織者會議惟不清楚吳有否與戴耀廷討論否決財案&quot;&gt;趙確認吳政亨無出席組織者會議、惟不清楚吳有否與戴耀廷討論否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大狀黃宇逸下午完成盤問趙家賢，續由代表吳政亨的大律師石書銘盤問，其中發起「三投三不投」的吳被指為初選組織者之一。趙確認，吳沒有出席初選組織者會議、記者會及協調會議。被問吳是否從沒參與立會過半後如何使用權力的討論，趙表示「我唔知佢有冇喺其他場合參與，所以我只能夠答唔清楚」。至於吳有否參與否決預算案的討論，趙同樣回答不清楚，重申不知道吳有否在其他場合或與其他人包括戴耀廷討論。趙亦同意，吳政亨並非在任何初選WhatsApp群組內，亦無參與製作初選提名表格，趙就後者稱「係民主動力做嘅，所以佢無參與」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林景楠曾轉發三投三不投廣告稱內容很多問題-民主動力總幹事覆非35廣告&quot;&gt;林景楠曾轉發「三投三不投」廣告稱「內容很多問題」 民主動力總幹事覆非「35+」廣告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘其後展示「新界東訊息發佈區」的WhatsApp群組，其中一個訊息來自「M」，他發送2020年7月3日「三投三不投」在《蘋果日報》刊登的頭版廣告，以紅色為底色，上有金剛箍繫着「候選人」字眼，亦有「7月11/12日 民主陣營歷史首次立法會大選初選！」、「立即聯署 約束政棍」等字句。「M」問「這個廣告是大會落的嗎？」，民主動力總幹事黎敬輝回答「不是」，趙確認黎是指這不是「35+計劃」的廣告。石問到「M」是否指林景楠，趙稱不知道，因電話沒有特別記認；主控萬德豪則確認「M」是林景楠。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林續發訊息稱：「這個廣告的內容很多問題，我建議大會澄清一下。另外，設計上，點解要用紅色做底色，好嘔心，同埋果隻藍色物體是否媽咪麵個 friend？對不起，我真係唔係太接受到這個頭版廣告。」鄒家成聞言捂嘴發笑，吳政亨則微微搖頭，而延伸庭的黃之鋒、馮達浚及袁嘉蔚均大笑。戴則於群組回應指：「這是一個民間團體搞的，與初選無直接關係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KSb5ZL3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 林景楠（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，在廣告刊登前他及民主動力均對此不知悉，民主動力亦無付錢賣廣告，直至林景楠在群組發送時才知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱曾提醒戴三投三不投或違選舉條例-戴承諾與大會無關&quot;&gt;趙稱曾提醒戴「三投三不投」或違選舉條例 戴承諾與大會無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問到，需否申報該廣告的費用，趙稱所有選舉開支、包括廣告開支，無論最後有沒有參與選舉都要申報，並解釋若廣告對候選人有利，該候選人就要按比率承擔費用並申報；而若落廣告者並非獲候選人聘為服務提供者或選舉開支代理人，則以其認知就是違反《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，戴曾因2016年「雷動計劃」賣廣告，該廣告對某些候選人有實質利益，但由於戴及其公司並非選舉開支代理人或服務提供者，亦無候選人向選舉事務處作申報，因此廉政公署作出拘捕，據趙的理解最終法庭判罪成。趙同意自己沒有參與在該案中，但指戴當時有相關構思時，「我同佢提過咁樣應該唔係好啱選舉法例嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙重申，與戴耀廷曾談及「李伯盧」，戴稱李伯盧是其粉絲，並指有這些民間團體幫手初選「係好重要」，而趙曾清楚向戴表示，李伯盧的「三投三不投」很大機會抵觸選舉相關法例，但戴稱「2016年雷動計劃都無事啦」，並承諾會提醒吳小心點。戴亦表示，李伯盧是在民間推動初選的民間團體，並向趙承諾，李伯盧的「三投三不投」與民主動力承辦初選的大會無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙強調民動工作與吳政亨及三投三不投無關&quot;&gt;趙強調民動工作與吳政亨及「三投三不投」無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘續問，趙是否不會視吳為「35+計劃」的組織者之一？趙稱：「我當然唔知道佢同戴耀廷之後有啲乜嘢嘅溝通」，但趙已經與戴講清楚，民主動力承辦初選時，「我哋做嘅一啲工作係同呢個團體冇關嘅」，而戴亦承諾會繼續與該「粉絲」聯絡，繼續推動初選。石亦問，趙是否不視「三投三不投」為他與戴耀廷和區諾軒籌辦「35+計劃」的一部分？趙略提高聲線表示：「我只可以回應同民主動力同我本人同區諾軒無關」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意廣告會令人誤會吳政亨是組織者之一&quot;&gt;趙同意廣告會令人誤會吳政亨是組織者之一&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙昨供稱，吳政亨文章予人印象他有份組織初選，並與區諾軒和戴耀廷談及。石書銘問到他這個印象是否錯誤，陳慶偉質疑不明白其問題，並改問是否任何人閱讀有關廣告後，均會如趙般錯誤認為吳有份組織初選？趙同意，並補充是「用一個 reasonable man 嘅角色」，延伸庭的被告聞後傳來「嘩！」聲。石再指，該印象是錯誤的，因為李伯盧並非初選組織者。法官問他是否指出案情，石確認，惟法官李運騰指趙的答案很清晰，就是李伯盧與「35+」沒有關係，其立場與區諾軒一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">控方指郭榮鏗同為本案「共謀者」 趙家賢被問「五大訴求」意思多番猶豫 趙家賢：戴耀廷常「夾硬嚟」、「順住個勢」令人按其意願辦事 林景楠曾稱「三投三不投」廣告紅色底色「好嘔心」 趙家賢指與民主動力及區諾軒無關</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Australia-India-U.S Trilateral</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-04-12-australia-india-us-trilateral.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Australia-India-U.S Trilateral" /><published>2023-04-12T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-04-12T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/australia-india-us-trilateral</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-04-12-australia-india-us-trilateral.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;China’s expanded nuclear capability merits deeper thinking within and among the U.S., Australia, and India about the possibility that China could change its nuclear strategy or doctrine — and the potential implications of such a change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, CSIS convened a track 1.5 dialogue of Australian, Indian, and U.S. experts to examine emerging threats and strategic stability in the Indian Ocean region. The discussion included analysts and former practitioners as well as several serving government officials from participating countries. The first session in June convened virtually. The second engagement convened in person in October. The engagements were held under the Chatham House Rule. Discussions revealed several specific areas of concern. Many but not all concerns focused on China. They included the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s conventional military modernization&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s non-transparent conventional and nuclear force changes&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s demonstrated willingness to use force — such as at India’s border with China — to assert its claims&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary-of-findings&quot;&gt;Summary of Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regional security dynamics are changing quickly.&lt;/em&gt; The most important observation from the discussion is that security dynamics in the Indo-Pacific (both the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean region) are changing quickly. The changes are in large part driven by China’s long-term investments in a more capable military, assertive diplomacy, and interdependent trade relationships. China’s unwillingness to participate in existing mechanisms to reduce risk of nuclear conflict or exchange, as well as its lack of interest in engaging in bilateral discussions on arms control, leave few meaningful opportunities for dialogue on conflict risk or conflict avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Close alignment of leaders.&lt;/em&gt; Growing concern about deteriorating regional stability and China’s role are driving close alignment among many regional leaders. Few have a closer alignment than the United States, Australia, India, and Japan. The four countries, collectively referred to as “the Quad,” have convened several times at the president and prime minister level over the past three years to build a positive agenda for peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region. Three Quad countries were represented in this dialogue. Aligned views among the leaders include concerns about China’s activities and approach, the international order, and China’s use of economic, diplomatic, or military power to force changes in the global system. However, close alignment is not driving sufficient bureaucratic change in the three countries. Achieving shared regional stability goals for the United States, Australia, and India will require carefully managing relationships among them, particularly given the differences between India’s approach to Russia compared with that of the United States and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Importance of industrial capacity.&lt;/em&gt; The fighting in Ukraine demonstrates the importance of industrial capacity to produce both “smart” and “dumb” weapons in great quantities to sustain a conflict between large militaries. This point is key for logistics and resupply efforts given the vast distances in the Indo-Pacific. Ukraine’s effective response to Russia’s invasion in early 2022, in contrast to its performance in the 2014 conflict, underscores the strategic importance of being prepared before a conflict begins, rather than waiting for the start of a conflict to initiate preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need for greater cooperation on technological development.&lt;/strong&gt; Technology will be a necessary, but not a deciding, factor in future military confrontations. “No one technology, on its own, is likely to be a game changer.” Instead, technologies would be most impactful “in novel combination, or with novel concepts of operation.” Developing new technologies and quickly converting them to capabilities with partners will be an important determinant of future success. Relatedly, institutional capacity to be a “fast follower” will be a necessary competency, as no country will dominate the overall sphere of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concerns about nuclear weapons and deterrence.&lt;/strong&gt; Russia threatened to use nuclear weapons, including battlefield nuclear weapons, in Ukraine. Russia’s threats were met with mixed response from the United States and France. The U.S. response, a clear articulation that nuclear weapons employment is unacceptable, contrasts with the statement by French president Macron, that France would not employ nuclear weapons in response to a nuclear attack against a non-ally. Discussion highlighted that, rather than reassuring a nuclear weapon state that it is not under nuclear threat, narrow responses like France’s may embolden leaders creating an opening where they judge nuclear employment to be worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, participants noted that China’s growing nuclear arsenal may cause it to reevaluate its current “no first use” nuclear policy. Changes to China’s nuclear doctrine could precipitate numerous defense decisions throughout the region regarding forces, posture, and investments driving toward a potential escalation spiral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analysis&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the two dialogue sessions in June (virtually) and October (in person), participants covered critical areas on a range of topics. This section attempts to summarize those rich discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alignment-between-leaders&quot;&gt;Alignment between Leaders&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Alignment between the leaders is closer than it has ever been.” Participants noted the importance of this alignment in pushing forward on key initiatives bilaterally, trilaterally, and within the Quad. The closeness of views has permeated several layers into government leaders, including ministers and their deputies. However, it has not reached the necessary “14 layers down” into the bureaucracies to convert high-level alignment to rapid execution of new initiatives. The quote describes the challenges that policymakers can face where shifts in policy — especially those that require changes in process or regulations — can sometimes be slow to occur. The result is that progress is slower than the expansive visions leaders have committed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;areas-of-agreement&quot;&gt;Areas of Agreement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leaders are aligned on the type of threat China poses: that it seeks to “become a regional, if not a global, hegemon” in ways that undermine the interests of the United States, Australia, and India.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All three participating countries view with concern China’s expansion and modernization of its conventional and nuclear forces. China’s willingness to use its forces to coerce or confront its neighbors heightens these worries. Though not unanimous, concerns were high regarding the risk of Chinese military activity to coerce Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior leader alignment on the threat China poses has yet to galvanize action across the three countries’ governments. One participant put it succinctly, “Security is bringing us together, the hard edge of security. We need to couple that with cooperation on critical technology and the need to compete.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;India is taking a different diplomatic and strategic approach to Russia than the United States and Australia. India’s continued engagement with Russia for energy, in particular, remains a complicating factor in the relationship among the three countries. Dialogue highlighted that, so far, all three countries have successfully worked through differing approaches to the ongoing war in Ukraine, but noted that without careful management and consideration from all sides, this issue creates a risk of impeding ongoing cooperation among them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concerns-about-china&quot;&gt;Concerns about China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants began the discussion noting the degree to which their respective countries are concerned about China’s conventional military modernization, the modernization and expansion of China’s nuclear forces, and the lack of transparency surrounding them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;areas-of-agreement-1&quot;&gt;Areas of Agreement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s policies and actions — both civilian and military — are reshaping the security environment in the Indo-Pacific region. China is seen as pursuing disruptive efforts including its military modernization and employment; its aim to dominate all aspects of critical technologies; its nuclear modernization and expansion; and its willingness to use force to coerce neighbors on border issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Individually, these changes could be seen as typical pursuits for a rising power. However, the compounding effect of China seeking all simultaneously was seen by participants as ominous for regional security. One participant observed, “China’s effort can only be assumed to be regional, if not global, hegemony.” Participants agreed that their countries would view such an outcome as counter to their interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants viewed China’s nuclear force expansion and modernization as detrimental to regional stability. “The absence of meaningful explanation or dialogue” about China’s expansion and modernization of its conventional and nuclear forces is worrisome and further detracts from stability in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants noted the importance of preparing to deter — or succeed in — a conflict should China initiate one. This included developing adequate land, sea, and air forces; effective capabilities in space, cyber, and other emerging domains; and the necessary cooperative agreements and arrangements among the three countries and other like-minded states to achieve desired effects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;areas-of-difference&quot;&gt;Areas of Difference&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China poses a threat to current regional stability. However, the three countries do not always classify this threat the same — as one Indian participant noted, “The United States and Australia are focused on Taiwan, not watching closely India’s main concern: its northern border. The countries have different priorities.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Indian participants noted the dual nature of needing to defend its northern border and advance maritime capability to create sufficient defensive capability in the Indian Ocean, which is “India’s only maritime boundary.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Australian participants’ greatest concerns focused on China’s economic and political coercion and interference within Australia. They expressed confidence that China’s coercive efforts against Australia have been successfully rebuffed and can serve as a model for other countries that might find themselves on the receiving end of a PRC coercion campaign. A secondary concern for Australian participants — though related to the primary defense concern — was a scenario where China used force against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, Australian participants highlighted a long-standing debate about Australia’s defense capability: whether it should be used solely to defend Australia’s borders or to protect its interests beyond Australia’s borders. The latter case creates a greater priority for long-range strike capability. In all cases, Australian participants noted that Australia would uphold its alliance commitment to the United States, but that the specifics of that support could range from access to bases in Australia for operations up to combined military operations in the Western Pacific or Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. participants were most concerned with a potential PRC action against Taiwan, primarily invasion, secondarily blockade, and thirdly the potential for a more forceful gray zone campaign to destabilize Taiwan. In each of those cases, U.S. participants noted the challenges the United States would face in making a prompt political decision, then converting that decision into appropriate diplomatic, economic, and military responses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants engaged in an exchange about the implications of the China-India border standoffs. One U.S. participant said that Washington sees “China’s border clashes as a strategic success because it reoriented India away from its pursuit of becoming a regional maritime power.” This assessment seemed to surprise — and run counter to — Australian perceptions of the standoff as a defeat for China as it showed itself as an aggressor to the region. Indian participants added that Prime Minister Modi indicated the Indian Navy will have the resources it needs for modernization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Other Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The three countries — and other like-minded countries such as Japan — can engage in different responses that meet national objectives while contributing to collective security. Potential examples of such activities include closer collaboration on military cooperation, exercises, logistics, and access; closer efforts on priority areas for research and development, and production; and identifying ways to adapt bureaucratic processes in ways that recognize that time is no longer an abundant resource.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;India faces a combined maritime and land border challenge; Australia a political, economic, and distant security challenge; and the United States an economic competitor with a high likelihood of attempting to change the regional status quo and undermine fundamental U.S. interests using force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One participant assessed that “China is in turmoil. Its economy and supply chains are under stress. Its employment system is not working. Its financial and construction sectors appear to be fragile, and people’s savings are at risk if the previous elements continue to show cracks.” If this assessment is correct, and to the extent China’s current fragility continues or grows, it could raise an opportunity for like-minded countries to allow China’s own political decisions to impede its further growth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technology-is-necessary-but-is-not-a-solution-by-itself&quot;&gt;Technology Is Necessary but Is Not a Solution by Itself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;areas-of-agreement-2&quot;&gt;Areas of Agreement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discussions touched several times on the importance of developing and utilizing technology effectively. This included, primarily, technology’s importance in economic competitiveness, and secondarily its importance for military purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants described several overall trends in technology that impact almost every country (not just those in the dialogue):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The pace of technology development and innovation is outstripping governments’ ability to either understand or regulate technology.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Technology development is, in nearly all fields, led by the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Governments and militaries are inept at identifying private sector technology and incorporating it into their systems.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Governments’ inability to understand or anticipate technology also limits their capacity to develop international normative regimes that meaningfully impact the trajectory of technology development.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;China may be an exception to these observations as its pursuit of civil-military fusion deliberately blurs the lines between private sector and military and may allow it to both pursue militarily relevant technology and incorporate it more quickly — though the last point is acknowledged as speculative.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each country in the dialogue maintains its own roster of priority technology areas. Those lists overlap in several major areas: underwater technology, both crewed and uncrewed; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance technology; artificial intelligence; hypersonic weapons and hypersonic weapon defense; space, including defense of and reconstitution; and, over the longer term, directed energy and a range of quantum technologies. Many of these technological areas are militarily or commercially sensitive, making cooperation more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants seemed to agree that technology would be a necessary, but not determining, factor in future military confrontations. One participant noted, “No one technology, on its own, is likely to be a game changer.” Instead, technologies would be most impactful “in novel combination, or with novel concepts of operation.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with expressed doubt about the limitation of specific technologies on the future of conflict, participants were keen to increase cooperation between the three countries on development of technology and capability. Implicit in this approach is that more technologically advanced economies would be more successful and by extension have a greater economic (and technological) base to support military development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concerns among participants on the needed urgency of modernization also led to discussion that “delivering at speed is what matters.” Successful technology cooperation, one expert suggested, should work on “components before systems, systems before capabilities.” Several comments emphasized the objective of starting small so countries could “work out patterns of cooperation” before attempting more complex endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overclassification of information (as distinct from intelligence) limits faster progress on a range of technology and production efforts. Discussions noted that within the U.S. government, the default seems to be marking a document with a no foreign (or NOFORN) handling instruction. For those working within the government, it is the safest because it is the most restrictive. However, those restrictions greatly inhibit future cooperation as it is time consuming to change information from NOFORN to a releasable (“REL”) state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discussions also highlighted the value of not only being the first to a technology, but, in an increasingly competitive world, developing the institutional capability to be a “fast follower.” This entails learning from others’ successes and rapidly adopting — or surpassing — the original discoverer. One participant noted that the PLA is “focused on innovating and scaling as a fast follower,” implying its goal was to rapidly incorporate technology developed by others into its operations, rather than develop its own.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;areas-of-difference-1&quot;&gt;Areas of Difference&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indian participants emphasized the importance of technology transfers to India so it can increase its domestic military capability production while simultaneously modernizing its military. Indian participants emphasized that India believed technology transfer should happen with minimal preconditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Australian participants emphasized a range of concerns regarding tech cooperation — and the restrictions on it — that inhibit Australia’s national efforts to remain interoperable with U.S. forces while satisfying its defense matériel requirements. Such issues include Australia’s efforts to acquire or build production facilities for precision-guided munitions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both Indian and Australian participants pointed out the difficulties in working through U.S. regulatory processes, such as the International Trafficking in Arms Regulations. Even successful processes can require an 18-month review. Cooperating “at speed” will necessitate faster processes, possibly based on a “presumption of approval rather than a presumption of denial.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An area of marked difference was an exchange about continued Indian reliance on advanced Russian equipment, such as its S-400 missile system, and U.S. and Australian concerns that those systems could pose a security risk to U.S. or Australian systems. Discussion considered two specific concerns: first, that sensitive technical information would be exposed through system interaction (sensors or communications data), and second, that Russian contractors operating Russian systems near U.S.- or Australian-originated equipment could collect intelligence that would diminish the U.S. or Australian advantage. Indian participants recalled India’s successful history of maintaining security of foreign-acquired systems and doubted U.S. or Australian concerns would be realized.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-of-technology-discussion&quot;&gt;Implications of Technology Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discussion focused on the importance of developing and adopting technology rapidly to deter and prevail in future conflict. Current development capabilities in the United States, Australia, and India fall short of this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concerns about the plausibility of tech transfer, as well as risks that efforts will be cut short due to export restrictions applied partway through the effort, limit more robust cooperation on technology development among the three countries. These issues will have to be mitigated, if not resolved, to begin cooperating at the pace and scale necessary to achieve leaders’ goals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. participants voiced concerns that requests for technology transfers often originate from partner governments to the United States. The U.S. government, however, “cannot direct companies to share their technology or set up business.” Additionally, one U.S. participant shared their frustration that even when the United States fast-tracks approval for capabilities requested by India, India sometimes chooses another bidder for the capability, creating questions within the United States as to whether the effort to fast-track a decision is worthwhile given other competing global priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;great-power-conflict-will-require-greater-industrial-capacity&quot;&gt;Great Power Conflict Will Require Greater Industrial Capacity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;discussion&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine demonstrates that militaries in future wars will need to draw on significant stocks of precision-guided munitions. Close fighting will require enormous quantities of traditional munitions, including artillery and small arms ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Against this assessment, U.S. and Australian participants noted that their countries lacked adequate production facilities to create “magazine depth” as well as insufficient industrial capacity to ramp up production of those capabilities once a conflict began.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to one comment early in the discussions, future war will be a “massive expenditure of munitions, production, and resupply” based on current industrial manufacturing capacity. “We just don’t have that [capacity].” Efforts to address that manufacturing shortfall are beginning in the United States and Australia, but do not seem to be happening at sufficient scope or pace to meet potential conflict timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recent unclassified wargaming by CSIS suggests that the United States could run out of precision munitions in the first week or two of a major conflict. One participant suggested that in certain stocks, the United States might “run out in less than a week.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;India’s assessment was mixed, claiming it retained substantial capacity to produce “basic” equipment such as ammunition and tanks. Indian participants noted India’s limitation in production such as precision-guided munitions or advanced air capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants agreed that their countries’ governments continue to engage in exercises of peacetime bureaucratic complacency regarding technology control, technology transfer, and company-to-company partnerships. Yet, the time to reverse those trends is now if they are to meet expected future needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States, Australia, and India are working to expand domestic production of such munitions and include efforts to create surge capacity. However, “precision-guided munitions take 18 months, in some cases, to produce.” The consequence is that waiting for the onset of conflict to activate contingency production makes those plans too late.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creating additional standing production is both expensive and potentially provocative. Thus, efforts to deter through developing (and demonstrating) sufficient production capacity to meet a current or future threat will require risk acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changing-nuclear-norms&quot;&gt;Changing Nuclear Norms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;discussion-1&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s nuclear force is a growing concern as it expands and modernizes. China is pursuing new warheads and delivery systems absent an articulation of what changes in its security environment are driving such significant investment, and without dialogue with regional states about their concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One participant noted that China is “shifting from a small to a medium nuclear power.” Further, its expanded and more capable nuclear force may lead China to, at a minimum, assess a shift in its nuclear “no first use” policy. It could, for example, move to a “launch on warning or launch on attack posture.” While that could be “undertaken as an operational shift without a rhetorical change,” either could be destabilizing to the region and precipitate several defense posture shifts from neighboring states concerned that China may threaten them with such weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Deterrence is being tested, as Russia stares defeat in the face. Will it use nuclear weapons?” Participants agreed that Russia’s threats to use nuclear weapons, including tactical nuclear weapons, in Ukraine undermined a clear standard against their use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ongoing development of dual-capable missiles and tactical nuclear weapons increases the risk that targeted states must respond more rapidly in a crisis, raising the risk of unintentional nuclear escalation or exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These ongoing changes in nuclear force development and discussion of how those forces might be employed suggests “there is an emerging nuclear world order.” However, it is not clear if the emerging order is based on similar principles of transparency or mutual vulnerability as the currently prevailing nuclear order is.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-of-nuclear-norms-discussion&quot;&gt;Implications of Nuclear Norms Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The discussion surfaced two additional concerns. First, few mechanisms currently exist for engaging in meaningful dialogue on risk reduction from nuclear weapons. Cold War (or post–Cold War) mechanisms are eroding or have lapsed, and none include China. As one participant summarized, “future arms control efforts are only possible with China at the table,” but it is not clear what would bring China to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, retaliatory deterrence is losing credibility. This is based on a combination of at least two factors: one, that national publics are not prepared for the potential of nuclear exchange, and two, that at least one nuclear weapons state has stated it would not use nuclear weapons in response to nuclear weapons used by a third country. These two positions, as judged by discussion participants, may actually “raise the likelihood that such weapons will be used” if the risk of retaliation is not credible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Findings and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section presents findings and recommendations focused on the United States and its government, unless otherwise specified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; The high degree of alignment between leaders in all three countries represents an important opening for progress. Close leader alignment is driving adoption of a wider range of high-priority issues between the countries, including through the Quad. Topics include diplomacy, commerce, defense, development, and research and development. Capitalizing on the current window of alignment will require prioritization both within and among these areas to deliver near-term demonstrable wins. Expectations are high in each system for such deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, at present, alignment is not translating into sufficient outcomes from the three countries’ governments. Achieving those outcomes will require transformations from each bureaucracy, though the needed level of change to redirect effectively may prove too uncomfortable, delaying progress and contributing to the belief that cooperation is too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Leaders at every level in government agencies should prioritize the internal focus necessary to ensure that old habits of internal operation and customary approaches to regulatory procedures no longer inhibit necessary progress to meet the challenge all three countries are facing. This may require explicit instruction to their organizations, updates to regulations (or their interpretation) with clear milestones for delivery, or establishing additional review and approval protocols based on different criteria than the existing processes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Within the United States, to ensure necessary senior-level attention, the National Security Council should convene an Intergovernmental Policy Committee (IPC) process to task and monitor progress on one key initiative from each responsible department. To ensure focus, the president should ask for a progress report at least monthly during his one-on-one meetings with the secretary of state, secretary of commerce, and secretary of defense. The most pressing areas of focus are on reducing delays in cooperation caused by export controls and document classification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s unexplained nuclear modernization and expansion, Russia’s threats to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine and recent decay in the arms control and monitoring regimes raise the prospect that nuclear threat (and the prospect of use) is being normalized. Further, nuclear weapons states expressing unwillingness to use nuclear weapons in response to nuclear weapons employment lowers the potential consequence of engaging in threats as well as employment for coercive purposes. To reduce the risk of nuclear threat or employment, responsible states must reestablish norms around nuclear weapons, including both offensive and defense employment, as well as the taboo against threatening their use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Reinvigorate public awareness and debate within each of the three countries’ publics — especially in the United States and India — about when, where, and why the state might choose to use nuclear weapons. In the United States, this effort is best led from the White House. The Department of Defense can play a role by articulating current and planned concepts of operation for nuclear force employment, including in defense or in extended deterrence, in speeches and testimony by the secretary of defense and other senior Defense Department leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Develop new channels for dialogue, including with China and with Russia, about respective views of nuclear weapons. These may lead to arms control or limitation discussions, but the current lack of meaningful dialogue on the issue creates greater risk of miscalculation or inadvertent nuclear escalation. New dialogue mechanisms will likely need to find ways to include nuclear weapons states that are not members of the UN Security Council to be effective. India and Pakistan should be included, and dialogue mechanisms should include methods to incorporate other plausible or expected nuclear states should such circumstances arise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Limitations on technology transfer, information sharing, and other key elements of capability development severely impede the ability to collaboratively develop, produce, or employ new technologies or capabilities with U.S. allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of Defense, the Department of State, and the Department of Commerce should engage with the business community and one another to better understand the current sticking points delaying a positive response and quickly identify ways to improve the system. The Department of Defense can lead either by driving the process alone or by leveraging an outside organization. The second course may lead to more credible results as contractors will likely be reluctant to directly criticize their customer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Regarding information and intelligence sharing, raise the bar for classifying U.S. documents no foreign (also known as NOFORN) so that it is not the default classification. Identify categories of information that should, as default, be releasable (REL) to specific partners based on criteria such as sensitivity of the topic and confidence in the other country’s information security practices, the cost-benefit of the information shared, and the outcome sought. The Departments of State and Defense should review the impacts of requiring non-delegable three-star-level approval to apply a NOFORN handling instruction on non-intelligence products.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Technology advances are necessary but not sufficient for fielding effective and modernized capabilities. Doing so requires incorporating emerging technologies with operational concepts, operator abilities and training, institutional support, and the overall capability system. Achieving this on a national basis is difficult. Implementation on a bilateral or multinational basis will be even more difficult. Incorporating emerging technologies and concepts that rely less on “bespoke capabilities, but provide effective, lower-cost options” will be necessary in future capability development. Success will require new forms of engagement internal to each of the three countries’ own processes and acceptance of higher risk tolerance for engaging earlier with allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of Defense, especially the military services, should increase the use of prototyping throughout the development process. Further, it should ensure prototype developers have steady interaction with operators on how, where, and why they would use such a prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure that new research efforts, systems design, prototyping, and experimentation include (when appropriate) allies and partners, to leverage a diverse range of experience and perspectives, and to ensure rapid convertibility of technologies to capabilities that can be used by a wide range of key U.S. partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Australia, India, and the United States remain focused on shared threats, yet have limited mechanisms to coordinate and exchange information in real time for crisis management or response. Such mechanisms will be most effective when developed, exercised, and refined before a crisis starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Hold a series of tabletop exercises at the track 1.5 or track 2 level that present crisis scenarios and push participants to identify potential gaps in their countries’ capabilities, access, or information that they may need to reach out to partners to secure, or that partners may need to reach out to them for assistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;趙家賢：選舉延期後戴耀廷未棄否決財案想法 欲建全民投票系統向泛民「施壓」&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;趙家賢稱提名表格寫法「籠統」如「九二共識」 為安撫泛民及抗爭派&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;趙家賢稱上庭前不知「李伯盧」身分 同意其文章予人組織者印象&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UtxZjkX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（11日）踏入審訊第40天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢續作供，稱在組織者宣布退出或休息、立法會選舉延期後，戴耀廷仍有很多「大思想家」的想法進行，曾於2020年8月底至9月初向他稱「過咗風眼位啦，冇事啦而家」、「你睇吓美國國務卿蓬佩奧，都讚我哋初選做得好呀」，並望民主動力捐80至100萬元予香港民意研究所建立全民投票系統，因傳統民主派對否決預算案有顧慮，戴望以民調向他們施壓。趙同意法官指，戴當時仍未放棄否決預算案令政府回應五大訴求的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟趙強調，他和民主動力行事一定要合法，絕不想戴計劃的事情「好似變咗民主動力繼續牽連參與落去」，故未有即時回覆，又指「我唔係好敢直接向佢say no」；最終僅回覆可在無指明項目下捐助約40萬予香港民研，惟最終因他和副召集人等被捕，未有動用相關款項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴耀廷擬捐80至100萬予香港民研-建立全民投票系統收集否決預算案意見&quot;&gt;趙稱戴耀廷擬捐80至100萬予香港民研 建立全民投票系統收集否決預算案意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢上周談及眾籌資金的去向，提到戴耀廷望民主動力預留80至100萬予香港民意研究所；又同意區諾軒於7月15日宣布退出初選工作後，他因抗爭派記者會「完全失控」而於7月16日宣布退出，同日戴耀廷亦宣布「希望在未來的一段日子，爭取多一些休息時間…當然，我不是甚麼也不再做，我必會與所有認同民主普選的香港人走在一起，在各自的位置，為達成這目標，繼續努力，直至民主普選臨到香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢本周主動補充，於2020年8月底9月初與戴耀廷面談，當時立法會選舉已延後、暫不需進行選前民意調查，而戴希望民主動力將80至100萬捐予香港民研，以建立一個收集民間意見的全民投票系統。趙解釋，因當時預計選舉延後一年後會再展開，而戴關注傳統民主派進入議會後會對否決預算案有保留，故望透過新系統了解市民意見，能夠統一屆時民主派的投票行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙擬捐100萬剩餘資金予慈善團體香港民研及民動-惟因被捕終未有動用&quot;&gt;趙擬捐100萬剩餘資金予慈善團體、香港民研及民動 惟因被捕終未有動用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指，當時回應戴指民主動力仍在計算35+初選的開支，未有承諾可以捐多少錢予香港民研，並補充該次會面是戴「希望約我去傾」，故趙約他去太古城酒店食早餐，「車位都幫佢安排埋」。趙其後於9月初計算好所有參選人的選舉經費，並將透過眾籌捐予民主動力、超過1,000元、沒有用在35+選舉開支的捐款統合，該筆款項約有100萬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，他判斷民主動力「有一個責任」為香港民研提供一定數額的金錢進行民意調查，但「絕對唔想戴耀廷所計劃嘅事情，好似變咗民主動力繼續牽連參與落去」，故他向民主動力執委會建議，在該100萬元進行「5:4:1」的分配，50萬捐予《稅務條例》88條註冊的慈善團體、40萬捐予香港民研、10萬留給民主動力作為會務經費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指，當時執委會認為50萬予單一慈善組織金額太大，建議增加一兩個慈善組織；並因執委會於2020年12月換屆，故待新一屆執委處理捐助安排。趙續指，他其後向新一屆執委會交待相關情況，他們需時考慮，惟到了2021年1月6日，民主動力的召集人、副召集人鍾錦麟和司庫關尚義皆被捕，故最終該筆款項留在民主動力戶口，並未有動用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴望以民調施壓予傳統民主派否決預算案-同意戴直至9月底未放棄用否決權想法&quot;&gt;趙稱戴望以民調施壓予傳統民主派否決預算案 同意戴直至9月底未放棄用否決權想法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指他們不關心民主動力戶口情況，但問戴耀廷希望研發的投票系統似乎是針對傳統民主派，而非本土抗爭派？趙重申戴的電子民意收集系統「當然個講法就梗係話」要收集不同市民是否同意否決預算案，但戴當時有特別提及望設立該系統，是源於傳統民主派對否決預算案有顧慮，「呢個係我當時收到佢同我講嘅訊息」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問因此戴耀廷直至2020年9月底，仍未放棄透過否決預算案令政府回應五大訴求的想法？趙答：「回應法官閣下，係，冇錯，佢好着重呢個憲制嘅權力」，又指他理解戴是「想攞呢個民意」，若民意支持否決預算案，「會畀到個壓力傳統民主派去服從」，並稱「所以都係因為咁樣，我或者民主動力唔想有款項支持有關系統嘅計劃。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱原簽約撥80萬予香港民研作選前民調-惟因選舉延後無生效&quot;&gt;趙稱原簽約撥80萬予香港民研作選前民調 惟因選舉延後無生效&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認控方指，若立法會官方選舉沒有延後，初選後原本會由香港民研進行選前民意調查，讓候選人更能掌握如何配票和決定出選名單，民主動力亦為此預留了約80至100萬，趙解釋因2016年立法會選舉，民主動力以80萬委聘仍在香港大學轄下的香港民研進行選前調查，故有此估算。趙其後確認，民主動力曾就選前民調與香港民研簽約，提及會支付香港民研80萬港元作民調之用，他解釋如立法會選舉如期進行，「嗰份合約應該履行同生效」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問及，選舉延期後，有否任何就選舉復辦時民意調查的計劃？趙指因當時工作未到該階段，故「戴耀廷冇好仔細去講係點樣做嘅」，但大方向也是如他早前所述。他又補充，當時選前民調是就所有官方選舉候選人進行，「無論民主派定建制派都全部都會做」。李運騰續問，故該民調是為確保民主派能贏取最多議席？趙同意，但補充民調數據公布後，「其實唔同黨派同市民都可以利用有關數據做自己嘅推測研究」。控方其後欲繼續就眾籌資金發問，惟法官陳慶偉指已聽夠相關證據，着控方就另一議題發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷數度問及民動預留民研款項-趙未有回覆我唔係好敢直接向佢say-no&quot;&gt;戴耀廷數度問及民動預留民研款項 趙未有回覆：我唔係好敢直接向佢say no&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方就提名表格等發問後，再返回香港民研的議題。控方引戴耀廷與趙家賢的WhatsApp紀錄，顯示戴在2020年9月10日曾問趙：「知道個數可以用嚟開發個投票系統未？」趙解釋，戴是指上述有關否決預算案的全民投票系統，但他當時「應該未有答」戴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至10月1日，戴發訊息指「Ben（鍾錦麟）告訴我民動會把錢捐給獨媒下的慈善機構，那筆錢大概會有多少？還有能確實可以給民意研究所的數目嗎？」，並於6日後再指「民意研究所想確知已籌的錢是否已把800K預先預備了作下年選前民調之用」。趙指，當時認知戴想要求民主動力「無論如何總之將80萬左右呢，係可以轉到畀佢畀香港民研，去做一啲後續戴耀廷想做嘅一啲項目」。惟他在法官李運騰指出下同意，上述訊息指的80萬是預留作選前民調，與研發新的投票系統是兩回事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就上述兩個訊息，趙均未有回覆，他指因當時民主動力仍在商討如何處理眾籌資金、捐給什麼慈善機構，他亦有向執委會報告，指「因為我要顧及個風險嘅問題，（民主動力）係唔應該喺後續有任何呢方面嘅嘢有關連嘅工作」，故當時「我唔能夠直接回應到戴耀廷」，「其實我唔係好敢直接向佢say no」。趙續指，當時他是一個「好困擾嘅迴避嘅取態」，重申他與民主動力於7月16日退出，「其實已經好代表到我好關注緊我同民主動力一定要做一啲係合法嘅工作」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴退出後仍有好多大思想家想法進行-稱美國國務卿蓬佩奧都讚我哋初選做得好&quot;&gt;趙稱戴退出後仍有好多「大思想家」想法進行 稱「美國國務卿蓬佩奧都讚我哋初選做得好」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟趙家賢指，「我好知道就係，戴耀廷佢係繼續仲係有好多佢呢個『大思想家』嘅諗法喺呢度繼續進行緊」，並指於8月底9月初與他在太古城會面時，「佢其實係有一種態度呢，佢嗰個字眼直程係話：『過咗風眼位啦，冇事啦而家』，而佢仲有講到係話，『你睇吓美國國務卿蓬佩奧，都讚我哋初選做得好呀』」，趙模仿戴耀廷說話時特意提高聲調。林卓廷聞言搖頭，鄒家成望向林露齒笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問，那趙家賢之後有再回覆戴耀廷嗎？趙續要求瀏覽餘下WhatsApp紀錄，顯示10月8日趙家賢有一個來自戴耀廷的未接來電，戴問「能否與民意研究所會面」，至10月19日戴再問趙「我明天會見鍾庭耀，你能否確認有多少錢可以給 PORI 開發投票系統？」，趙均沒有回覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴追問能付多少錢予香港民研-趙稱無特別項目指明可捐數十萬惟不會撥款新項目&quot;&gt;戴追問能付多少錢予香港民研 趙稱無特別項目指明可捐數十萬惟不會撥款新項目&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，在10月19日的訊息後，10月份一個民主派區議會正副主席交流會邀請了戴耀廷出席，當時戴想推動一些「地區法治教育計劃」，他並在會後與他見面說了數句。法官陳慶偉一度質疑是否有需要知道這些詳情，萬德豪指望讓證人完成，趙續指戴當時有追問「究竟比到幾多錢佢協助到香港民意研究所嘅工作」，而趙當時稱應可無條件、在無指明特別項目下捐助3、40萬予香港民研，但強調民主動力並不會就其他新項目對香港民研進行撥款或資助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示WhatsApp紀錄，顯示黎敬輝於10月20日曾向趙家賢發訊息，稱「大約100萬要捐 還有～56萬為淨收入」，趙重申100萬是所有1,000元以上的眾籌捐款；至於淨收入則是撥歸民主動力經費的收入。萬德豪問是否與35+計劃有關的眾籌收入，趙否認，指黎是匯報民主動力整個財政狀況，56萬應是對民主動力當時項目的捐助淨收入。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴耀廷提議外判科大初創企業設投票系統民動曾付160萬予香港民研&quot;&gt;趙稱戴耀廷提議外判科大初創企業設投票系統、民動曾付160萬予香港民研&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢下午確認，民主動力曾就初選投票支付160萬予香港民意研究所，涉民研在初選票站收集數據和相關IT系統的費用，並指戴耀廷曾提議香港民研將投票系統項目外判予香港科技大學一所初創企業，香港民研曾擬備忘錄（MOU）予民主動力簽署，列出所需的服務款項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢大量whatsapp紀錄呈堂-趙同意whatsapp整體上是可靠&quot;&gt;趙家賢大量WhatsApp紀錄呈堂 趙同意WhatsApp整體上是可靠&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方審訊中呈上大量趙家賢的WhatsApp紀錄，法官陳慶偉今問到，趙2020年7及8月在接收WhatsApp訊息上有沒有遇到困難，趙稱「我唔係好明你呢個問題」；陳續改問，他在該時期有否試過不能接收訊息，趙回答：「我唔能夠確認當時有冇任何困難」，因WhatsApp「有時會整Server（伺服器）、有時出問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳追問就他個人而言，於2020年1至9月收訊息上有否遇到困難，趙憶述當時不覺得有特別問題出現，反而有些附件相隔太久沒有下載，現在則未能下載。最後趙同意整體來說，WhatsApp系統是可靠。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（11日）踏入審訊第40天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢續作供，指於初選提名表格加入「支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識」條款，是因傳統民主派和抗爭派對是否簽協議對立很大，而條款寫法「籠統」，是為安撫迎合主張簽署和不簽的兩派，讓他們各有解讀，有如「九二共識」，「一個中國，各自表述」，多名被告發笑。趙又同意，原由戴耀廷和區諾軒決定參選人有否違反計劃共識，以決定是否沒收選舉按金，惟因他已退出初選、立法會選舉亦延期，故民主動力在無考慮有否違共識下將所有按金發還參選人，亦無向參選人確認有否遵守提名表格條款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱各區共識為進行初選投票和否決財政預算案-提名表格列認同協調會議共識&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱各區共識為進行初選投票和否決財政預算案 提名表格列認同協調會議共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪就提名表格發問，當中第二點條款為「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」。控方問「共識」是指什麼，趙未有正面回答，僅強調就該「協調會議共識」，「我有特別講到明係戴耀廷同區諾軒主導，因為並不是由民主動力去主導同進行協調」。萬德豪打斷指是問他該字眼的意思，法官陳慶偉亦指簡而言之即趙不知道？趙續指「因為各個區有啲唔同嘅關係」，故當時用了一個「籠統」的寫法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意法官陳慶偉指，他被告知協調會議上達成共識，否則不會加入上述條款，並指是戴耀廷告訴他。趙並指，戴曾向他提及各選區達到共識才可進行初選，「而點樣去運用基本法嗰個權力（否決預算案），就各個區係有一啲唔同嘅寫法」。陳慶偉續問，戴有否告訴他協調會上達到的其他共識？趙指「回憶所及冇」，指主要是否決權的問題，「當然對我嚟講最重要係佢同意初選要做公民投票嘅形式」。趙確認，即會上共識是進行初選投票，及同意否決預算案，只是字眼有不同寫法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱提名表格條款籠統以安撫抗爭及傳統泛民-指如九二共識各自表述&quot;&gt;趙稱提名表格條款「籠統」以安撫抗爭及傳統泛民 指如「九二共識」各自表述&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續問，「35+公民投票計劃及其目標」是指什麼？趙指「35+公民投票計劃」是指初選這個讓市民參與投票的「活動項目」，重申民主動力是選舉服務提供者。至於「目標」，趙指是望民主派能在立法會取得過半議席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續主動補充，於6月初草擬報名表格，事後戴耀廷於記者會上稱毋須簽署協議，惟之後本土抗爭派三人發起「墨落無悔」聲明，故民主動力加入第二點條款。陳慶偉問，即加入條款是為了安撫（pacify）抗爭派和迎合（accommodate）不願簽聲明的人？趙同意，指條款寫得較「籠統」，是因「墨落無悔」出台後，傳統民主派和本土派「變咗個對立性好大」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續問，趙家賢或民主動力有特別請參選人留意第二點嗎？趙指記憶中總幹事簽收文件時，「佢回條好似有特別提到呢樣嘢嘅，因為咁樣先至能夠令到本土抗爭派或者傳統民主派都睇到大家用咗呢個條款，我叫做係用佢哋個角度去解讀，叫做『一個中國，各自表述』，『九二共識』嗰種」，鄭達鴻、鄒家成、彭卓棋等多人發笑，陳志全亦邊皺眉邊笑，何啟明一臉驚訝。在延伸庭的黃之鋒則大笑及「O嘴」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉笑着說，「One China policy， 一中各表」，並再向趙澄清，即參選人交表時，總幹事黎敬輝會請他們留意第二點？趙同意，指行政上有這樣做。陳續問，即黎會要求參選人簽署認同第二點？趙指不記得形式，但因參選人參與此「項目」要繳交一萬元按金，「應該收按金時大家有啲文件確認，可能將呢個條款特別提示出嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指總幹事製作按金收據-列明若違共識沒收按金-稱由戴耀廷區諾軒決定誰違共識&quot;&gt;趙指總幹事製作按金收據 列明若違共識沒收按金 稱由戴耀廷區諾軒決定誰違共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續展示民主動力予參選人的選舉按金收據，趙家賢指由民主動力總幹事黎敬輝準備，參選人報名時附上一萬元的按金支票，民主動力就會給予此收據，並指當黎向他匯報時，他才知道有這張收據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;收據第二項條款同樣提及：「『民主派35+公民投票計劃』候選人必須支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」。趙家賢同意此條款與提名表格上的條款相同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第三項條款列明：「選舉按金將於立法會選舉後全數發還；如候選人違反上述共識，將不予發還」。趙表示，當初答應戴耀廷邀請承辦初選時，戴曾提及民主動力會收選舉按金，若參選人違反條款就要沒收。惟就怎樣才算是違反共識，「呢個並唔係我哋民主動力嘅決定」，而需由會議協調人戴耀廷及區諾軒決定，民動只是執行角色。趙相信黎敬輝因此加上相關條款，並稱忘記是他與戴開會時被黎聽到此說法，還是趙聽到戴說法後向黎交代。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問草擬好提名表格後有否給予戴耀廷或區諾軒審批，趙稱曾將表格放上組織者群組，知道戴曾看過，區亦指「戴耀廷有睇過得啦」；至於收據則沒有放上群組，趙重申因總幹事在使用收據時才告知他，已製作收據方便行政工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱選舉延期後將所有按金發還參選人但無考慮是否違共識-僅呂智恆未取回&quot;&gt;趙稱選舉延期後將所有按金發還參選人但無考慮是否違共識 僅呂智恆未取回&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，民主動力何時將按金發還予參選人？趙表示在2020年9月6至8日，因之前要處理票站的行政開支；並指發還時亦一併安排選舉開支單據予參選人及其團隊申報。李提到，趙早前稱是否發還按金不是由民主動力決定，但這卻發生了？趙解釋，本身戴耀廷邀請他時，計劃並非由民主動力決定是否發還按金；但當政府宣布選舉延期後、加上趙於7月16日宣布退出初選，「我哋民主動力要做返一個服務提供者嘅責任」，將所有資料發還予參選人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，在發還按金前沒有問戴耀廷或區諾軒，指因他已退出初選，他只是「做返本身初選計劃嘅工作」，即處理善後工作。李再問，即他們沒有考慮是否符合第三項條款就發還？趙同意，強調已與民主動力退出之後任何關於35+協調的計劃。李續問，是否所有參選人都有取回按金？趙表示絕大部份人已取回，除了呂智恆，指當時職員多次聯絡呂取回資料及支票不果，最終他沒有取回。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指戴耀廷着民主動力收取參選人夾附共同綱領-強調民動只存放不跟進&quot;&gt;趙指戴耀廷着民主動力收取參選人夾附共同綱領 強調民動只存放不跟進&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪其後問到，有沒有參選人不同意表格上所指的共識？趙表示他及總幹事均沒有收過任何相關提問。萬再展示提名表格，內有予參選人寫政綱的「方格表」，其中施德來在「方格表」附上其名字、個人資料及照片，並在政綱一欄張貼「墨落無悔 堅定抗爭」的單張。趙表示，該表格是模擬官方選舉將相關資料打印予選民的做法，而民主動力無將資料寄予選民，只是吩咐站長張貼在票站予人查閱，與官方選舉做法相同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙亦同意，有些參選人會自行附上本身不屬提名表格的共同綱領。萬德豪問參選人是否可夾附任何資料？趙表示「正常唔應該係咁處理」，惟當時九東及新西有自行簽署的綱領，作為協調人的戴耀廷及區諾軒都覺得「地區做主導」，作為初選倡議人的戴亦曾在組織者群組及與趙的通話表示，希望民主動力照樣收取該些綱領。趙強調當時已向戴表明，「我哋民主動力只係按戴耀廷嘅要求，接收呢啲文件作存放，唔會作任何跟進」，因為並非民主動力需要收取文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙認為簽署等於會遵守條款無再向參選人確認&quot;&gt;趙認為簽署等於會遵守條款、無再向參選人確認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就提名表格的第3至7條，包括聲稱沒有外國居留權、不曾因《立法會條例》被DQ等，趙稱是參考官方選舉表格中合適的部分，並複製在初選提名表格上，強調他們望能選出市民支持的民主派代表參選官方選舉，故須遵守所有相關的條款，尤其第6條「特此聲明擁護《基本法》及效忠香港特別行政區」，趙重申這是民選議員的「應有之義」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問，趙複製條款的做法是想確保參選人能夠入閘，但他有沒有確認參選人有否遵守條款，包括擁護《基本法》及效忠香港特別行政區？趙表示與正式選舉做法一樣，簽署就等於確認整個頁面的條款。趙亦表示自己不會問參選人相關問題，「因為喺民主動力同我本人角度會覺得，呢個官方選舉都需要一啲條款守則 ，你簽署得嘅就需要遵守」。法官陳仲衡問到，趙是否知道有參選人曾因違反《立法會條例》而喪失提名資格，趙回答指：「當時唔清楚」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kT3yquq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（11日）踏入審訊第40天。發起「三投三不投」、網名「李伯盧」的吳政亨被指為初選組織者之一，趙家賢表示直至逾兩年前上庭才得知「李伯盧」身分，並認為他「講到好支持初選」、「好似係一齊舉辦初選嘅其中一部分」，同意其文章予人印象他是初選組織者之一。趙曾就此問區諾軒及戴耀廷，區指不認識李伯盧，戴則指李是曾協助他雷動計劃的粉絲，認為其組織對民間推動初選很有用。此外，趙認為「三投三不投」籲不投給不服從初選的參選人或違《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》，但戴回應：「點會咁容易有問題呀，嗰時雷動計劃，我哋賣廣告都冇嘢呀！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱直至前年上庭才知道吳政亨是李伯盧&quot;&gt;趙稱直至前年上庭才知道吳政亨是「李伯盧」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪下午就發起「三投三不投」、被指為初選組織者的吳政亨發問。在主問下，趙家賢表示知道「李伯盧」（吳政亨網名），並指在李於 Facebook 專頁發表政見時首次認知該名字。趙指在初選前無接觸過李，僅從戴耀廷、一些政界人士和傳媒報導聽聞他，直至2021年3月1日就本案首上庭才知道吳政亨就是「李伯盧」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱組織者終要求落選者承諾服從參選機制及支援35-包括不參選及支持勝選者&quot;&gt;趙稱組織者終要求落選者承諾服從參選機制及支援「35+」 包括不參選及支持勝選者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「李伯盧」發起的「三投三不投」，呼籲在初選和官方選舉投票，並投給初選勝出者；及不投票予「不支持、不參與及不服從」初選的參選人。萬德豪續問，初選原本想法是否要初選落選者支持勝選者？趙表示，以往傳統民主派初選也有討論，有政黨組織同意該做法；但亦有組織認為落選後既已不會參選，是否支持勝選者應視乎情況而定，如有否被勝選者邀請等，亦有人擔心若為勝選者助選，「冇咁鐵票」的支持者會因此流失並轉移。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡一度指是問及2020年的情況，趙指「知道法官閣下，我盡快會講我嘅想法」，續指因此至2020年戴耀廷提出「35+計劃」，亦沒有指明落選者一定要支持勝選者，因落選者已承諾不參與正式選舉和已作「取捨」，票源已更集中不會被分薄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪追問，趙是否知道李伯盧對此的意見？惟代表吳的大律師石書銘即提出反對，法官陳慶偉不批准繼續發問。萬續改問組織者最終的看法，趙表示最終落選者須服從初選機制、不參與選舉，亦要承諾用其方法支援整個「35+計劃」，包括支持勝選者參加官方選舉。法官陳仲衡問是否即等於選舉按金收據上列明的條款？趙指大致上是，亦同意這是發還按金的條件，亦同意在各區協議最終版本亦有提及相關條款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指戴協調會上引述李伯盧說法-指民間亦提出要服從初選機制&quot;&gt;趙指戴協調會上引述李伯盧說法 指民間亦提出要服從初選機制&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到戴耀廷在會議上如何談及李伯盧，趙指起初在協調會議，戴沒有提及落選者一定要支持勝選者，惟在討論過程中，有政黨和組織開始如此表明。趙續指，記得戴會上提及李伯盧時形容他為民間團體人士，並引述稱有民間團體人士希望有初選、亦望有心出選的人可參與初選，並認為候選人已參與機制就應該服從。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙認為，戴耀廷當時欲提出除了政界討論初選機制，民間亦有提出相關想法，特別是要服從初選機制，因此戴提倡落選者須支持勝選者。趙並指其後經討論後，相關條款就被寫在協議文件上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指李伯盧如成舉辦初選一部分-曾問區諾軒呢條友乜水但獲回覆不認識李&quot;&gt;趙指李伯盧如成「舉辦初選一部分」 曾問區諾軒「呢條友乜水」但獲回覆不認識李&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問及趙有否聽過「三投三不投」，趙表示聽過並知道是李伯盧提出，當時有政界朋友告知他相關運動，李伯盧曾稱「三投三不投」獲戴耀廷「加持」。趙續指他於5月底至6月中，即民主動力答應承辦初選後，曾與區諾軒就吳政亨和「三投三不投」討論，他當時認為李伯盧「講到佢好支持個初選，個形態變到好似係佢協助緊呢個，舉辦初選嘅一部分」，「我就打問號啦當然係」，此時鄒家成望向吳政亨笑着搖頭，被告席亦傳來「痴線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表吳政亨的大律師石書銘指法庭傳譯主任有錯，似乎將吳說成是初選組織者的一部分，但趙並無提及吳是組織者之一。法官陳慶偉續問趙，根據吳所發表的文章，會否給予趙印象，吳是組織者之一？趙一度停下思考，陳慶偉指這是很簡單的問題，着趙簡單回答，趙續說「Yes」，這時鄒家成搖頭發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續憶述當時問區諾軒：「喂區軒，呢條友乜水嚟㗎？佢好似係一齊舉辦初選嘅其中一部分咁嘅？」，又問：「係咪你同戴耀廷除咗邀請我同民主動力之外，仲邀請埋佢，係咪有啲安排我唔知道㗎？」。區則回答指他完全不認識也不認知此人，趙逐向區表示「我好擔憂個情況」，鄒家成張開嘴巴發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷指李伯盧是其粉絲曾助雷動計劃-其組織對民間推動初選很有用&quot;&gt;戴耀廷指李伯盧是其粉絲曾助雷動計劃 其組織對民間推動初選很有用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢之後再問戴耀廷有否聯絡過李伯盧，並問及「佢究竟係咩角色、咩身分嚟㗎，點解好似變咗係初選嘅其中一個舉辦方咁樣？」，戴表示李伯盧是其「fans（粉絲）」，曾幫忙他舉辦的「雷動計劃」，戴認為該些組織對在民間推動初選很有用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟趙向戴表示，「35+計劃」是民間初選，望集中票源在出選名單上以免浪費選票，而參選人須遵守機制，若落敗就自願地不參與官方選舉。趙強調這是出於參選人的自願態度，因根據香港的選舉條例，任何人都有自由參與或不參與選舉。這時延伸庭的岑敖暉微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙認為三投三不投阻礙參選人會違選舉條例-戴雷動計劃賣廣告都冇嘢&quot;&gt;趙認為「三投三不投」阻礙參選人會違選舉條例 戴：雷動計劃賣廣告都冇嘢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而對李伯盧提出的「三投三不投」，即呼籲在初選和官方選舉投票，並投給初選勝出者；及不投票予「不支持、不參與及不服從」初選的參選人，趙家賢認為「三投」對勝選者是一個「支持嘅動作」，但「三不投」對有機會參選的人而言是一個「阻礙」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪一度指就「三投三不投」的證供已足夠，惟趙稱「主控好快㗎啫」，法官陳慶偉亦指明白趙是想說他反對「三投三不投」，因認為會限制人們參選的自由，趙指「冇錯嘅法官閣下」，重申這樣會違反《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》。法官李運騰問及戴耀廷有甚麼回應，趙引述戴當時回答：「點會咁容易有問題呀，嗰時雷動計劃，我哋賣廣告都冇嘢呀！」，並回應聽到趙的關注，指會叫李伯盧在推動時更為小心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

Key contributors to China’s economic growth over the past two decades will not be repeated: demographic dividends, rising global exports, booming property construction, and unprecedented single-country expansion of credit and debt.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Local governments laden with debt are increasingly unable to implement Beijing’s policy initiatives. An economic rebound after lifting Covid-related controls on citizens’ movement and activity is already underway this year, but all of the structural headwinds to China’s growth will persist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign that China’s leadership launched in 2016 to reduce systemic financial risks is the only logical starting point to explain how China’s structural economic slowdown began. By reducing the growth of the “shadow” or informal banking system, China’s financial authorities cut credit growth in half and made it far more difficult for Beijing to power the economy using its traditional tools of credit-fueled investment by state-owned enterprises and local governments. Over the course of the deleveraging campaign, property developers continued expanding their own borrowing, inflating an unprecedented real estate bubble even larger before it finally burst in late 2021, amplifying China’s current economic distress. The deleveraging campaign marked the end point of China’s unprecedented credit expansion after the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the legacy of China’s deleveraging campaign is complex. Had Beijing not taken the forceful steps it did targeting shadow banks starting in 2016, China probably would have faced a financial crisis far earlier, as its system became increasingly difficult to regulate and was already resembling parts of the U.S. financial system ahead of the 2007–2008 global financial crisis. Acting preemptively to control risks in one area of the financial system ended up creating them in another. China had previously used its financial system as a shock absorber for political risks from a slowing economy, rolling over loans and extending credit to unproductive enterprises in order to avoid unemployment and bankruptcies. After the deleveraging campaign cut rates of credit growth almost in half, China’s financial system can no longer play this role, and more credit risks and political consequences are now materializing within the economy, from banks to property developers and local governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report aims to objectively and comprehensively analyze the economic and political consequences of China’s deleveraging campaign, which are closely related to China’s current economic slowdown. The deleveraging campaign is an important test case of the adaptability and flexibility of the Chinese state to respond to meaningful economic challenges, such as the growth of the shadow banking system. The campaign reflected a series of monetary and regulatory policy choices, where Beijing was forced to calibrate its response to avoid creating unexpected shocks to the financial system, while still reducing systemic risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the internal politics of China’s deleveraging campaign shifted over time, particularly as political power became more centralized under Xi Jinping in the late 2010s. The deleveraging campaign was successful in some of its objectives because China’s top leaders were narrowly focused on reducing financial risks, but maintaining a consensus behind this objective became far more difficult as the economy suffered. As tightening monetary policy gave way to new regulations, a consensus-driven approach to policymaking also gave way to a campaign-style system of economic governance, marked by periodic crackdowns against internet platform companies and the for-profit education industry. This year, the Chinese Communist Party took concrete steps to strengthen centralized control of China’s financial system, in what may presage another political campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing faces difficult strategic choices ahead as it confronts the end of the credit and investment-led growth model that has powered China’s economy for the past two decades. Restructuring local government debt and the central-local fiscal relationship are near-term imperatives, along with the need to unlock additional spending power for Chinese households to ensure more sustainable growth. Interest rates will need to fall in order to manage debt levels, creating incentives for capital outflows and corresponding pressures on China’s exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rising risks within China’s economy and financial system also raise new policy questions for the United States in the context of rising systemic competition. Liberalization of China’s financial markets has been a long-held U.S. objective, but China’s limited convergence with global economic practices and norms has elevated political concerns about deeper linkages between China and global markets. The United States has a clear interest in regulating its own markets transparently, including Chinese firms’ participation in those markets, rather than attempting to influence or alter the calculations of risks and returns for investors in China’s financial markets. Beijing has plenty of challenges of its own attracting foreign investment given the headwinds China’s economy is now facing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-fear&quot;&gt;The Fear&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the summer of 2022, China’s economy and its housing market were in free fall. The real estate industry had been overbuilding for years, even as China’s working-age population had peaked around 2013. Property developers under pressure from new regulatory restrictions started to default in large numbers in 2021, led by Evergrande, China’s largest and most indebted home builder. When Evergrande defaulted in late 2021, its debt level was over $300 billion, roughly equal to the gross domestic product (GDP) of Finland. Covid-19 restrictions imposed in early 2022, including the complete lockdown of Shanghai and similar restrictions in multiple cities, put further pressure on property sales as developers’ revenues suddenly plummeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even amid the flagging economy, Beijing was suddenly confronting a novel problem within its real estate markets: property developers had sold large numbers of apartments before they were actually built. Now those same developers were running out of money, which meant Chinese citizens who had bought homes, often using their life savings as a down payment and incurring additional mortgage debt, were at risk of never seeing them built. Moreover, developers’ financial problems were becoming increasingly apparent to new home buyers. Developers became effectively unable to sell properties after defaulting on their debt, and buyers feared the homes might never be completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, many home buyers who were waiting for their homes to be delivered began collectively threatening to stop paying their mortgages as a way to force Beijing to act. This is not uncommon in housing crises, as home buyers whose homes are worth less than the amount borrowed have an incentive to walk away from the debt. The difference in China, however, was that the homes had not even been built before home buyers began threatening to default. Home buyers lost confidence in the entire industry after most developers began relying on preconstruction sales. If Chinese citizens made good on their threats to stop paying, China’s banks would be at risk of trillions of yuan in nonperforming mortgage loans, turning the housing industry crisis into a broader financial threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selling apartments before construction is complete is common practice in many real estate markets. But in most of these markets, there are strict escrow requirements for sales revenues enforced upon developers to prevent exactly the scenario unfolding in China in the summer of 2022. Although escrow requirements existed in China, local governments enforced them very selectively. China was now facing an unprecedented combination of economic and financial threats, plus a crisis of confidence in the value of households’ primary financial assets, which threatened to weaken consumer spending as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the catalyst of change for real estate developers relying on preconstruction housing sales as a source of revenue was an attempt to reform and stabilize China’s financial system. Starting in 2016, Beijing embarked upon a broader effort to crack down on shadow financing channels using a combination of monetary and regulatory tightening steps, collectively labeled the “deleveraging campaign.” In the property sector specifically, the sudden elimination of shadow financing for developers forced home builders to repay their shadow debt by borrowing from another channel: home buyers. This introduced Ponzi-type financing systems into an industry that over the previous two decades had been one of the most important drivers of China’s economic growth. When credit and sales revenues started to run out in 2021 and 2022, rather than default on shadow lenders, real estate developers risked defaulting on individual homeowners and, in the process, dismantling an industry that represented around one-quarter of China’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pushing-the-system-to-the-brink&quot;&gt;Pushing the System to the Brink&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seeds of the property market meltdown had been sown almost a decade earlier during one of the first attempts by Chinese authorities to contain growth in the shadow banking sector. Thursday, June 20, 2013, was a frightening day for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), even if only a few people within China’s bureaucracy understood what happened. On that summer day, China’s financial system came to the brink of collapse. China’s central bank, charged with maintaining financial stability, had unintentionally forced the system to an unsustainable point. Interbank short-term money market rates shot up to 20–30 percent, indicating banks were holding onto all available cash and unwilling to lend to other banks, even at very high interest rates. Those prohibitive rates also meant banks were unwilling to lend to companies and households at more conventional rates. Had this money market squeeze continued, China would have risked significant economic contraction and insolvencies by multiple financial institutions. Within weeks, the nation’s remarkable record of sustained economic growth over the previous two decades would have come to a screeching halt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the property market meltdown, the most severe liquidity squeeze China’s financial system had faced was ironically caused by a genuine effort at reform. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC), China’s central bank, was trying to reduce banks’ reliance upon riskier funding channels, known as wealth management products (WMPs). Because China’s deposit and lending rates were fixed within narrow ranges, banks could not compete for deposits based on offering higher interest rates. WMPs provided a work-around. They allowed investors higher rates of return than official deposit rates for short periods, such as one month or three months. Investors would then typically roll over the products as they matured, attracted by continued higher returns. Banks could attract new funding and expand their lending as well, bypassing regulatory limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems arose when banks suddenly could not find investors for new products, which meant they needed to repay investors in the maturing WMPs. The PBOC ended up encouraging just such an event by suddenly withholding liquidity from banks during a time when they were looking to the PBOC, their mother bank, for reassurance that conditions would stabilize. Instead, the central bank delivered a warning at a meeting on June 17 that banks needed to rely upon themselves to manage imbalances between their volatile funding sources and riskier assets, rather than wait for help from the PBOC. The message triggered shock waves throughout China’s financial system. Banks immediately cut back on lending to one another, as traders knew many banks were in vulnerable positions and were fearful no assistance would be forthcoming from the mother bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As those decisions quickly cascaded around the banking system, there was very little cash on offer for regular bank business, such as lending to companies and households or trading securities. This caused interbank money market rates to rise sharply. With money market rates suddenly higher than the interest rates banks were offering on WMPs, WMPs became far less attractive to investors, which included banks themselves. Now banks issuing those WMPs had a new problem: their investors wanted their money back, which meant banks needed to borrow aggressively in the money market. But at that point, few banks were willing to lend money at all, and the PBOC appeared unwilling to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result was a massive liquidity crunch on June 20, 2013, as funding became suddenly unavailable throughout the Chinese financial system. Some commentaries compared the event, with some justification, to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the U.S. financial crisis of 2008. Banks and investors started acting rationally to protect themselves by selling virtually anything that could be sold. The stock market suddenly plummeted by over 10 percent in a day and a half, even though there were administrative limits on how far stocks could actually decline in daily trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central bank panicked. It first provided emergency liquidity to calm the markets late in the day on June 20. Then, on June 25, with the stock market still declining, it released a statement claiming liquidity would be available and sufficient for regular market operations. Money market rates gradually stabilized in the following days. The crisis was over but at the cost of the PBOC’s credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following years, WMP issuance and shadow banking activity expanded rapidly. The market had called the central bank’s bluff. Facing the threat of a self-created liquidity crisis, the PBOC blinked. After the central bank backed down so publicly, traders could be reasonably sure the PBOC would do the same in the future and would provide funding to the market when conditions became truly dire. As a result, banks and traders could afford to take more risks. Shadow banking products, even though they were highly risky and delivered high and unsustainable rates of return to investors, had basically become too big to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The June 2013 interbank market crisis marked the end of innocence for China’s financial system — China was now playing in the big leagues of global finance, and this type of mismanagement of basic money market conditions was noticed worldwide. Greater risks loomed ahead as the financial system continued to become much larger and more complex. The crisis was China’s first limited attempt at reducing risks within the financial system, and the results showed that the next attempt would need to be much more comprehensive in scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the PBOC was taken by surprise by these events. How had China’s shadow banking system become so large, so quickly that it suddenly posed a threat to financial stability? If the central bank could not control the system in its early stages of growth in 2013, how could it do so in the future? Fear of financial crisis gripped China’s regulators following the June 2013 interbank market squeeze. The events of that month highlighted the challenge China’s financial authorities would eventually face in attempting to dramatically remake its financial system to avert a much larger crisis. This effort, starting in May 2016, became known as China’s deleveraging campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-study-chinas-deleveraging-campaign&quot;&gt;Why Study China’s Deleveraging Campaign?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report analyzes the effects of China’s deleveraging campaign, which was Beijing’s attempt to reduce systemic risk within its financial system, primarily involving policy choices from 2016 to 2019. An in-depth study of this period in China’s history may seem mistargeted and out of date given China’s far more pressing ongoing economic slowdown and property market crisis, which have produced a dramatic downshift in economic growth and significant financial stress in onshore markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the deleveraging campaign is the only natural starting point to understand China’s current economic and financial distress and how financial risks emerged despite genuine efforts to reform China’s system. China’s economic growth over the past two decades has depended heavily upon a set of conditions — rapid credit and investment growth as well as a booming property and land market — that cannot continue in the future. Maintaining the current course of investment-led growth is a dead end and will produce lower rates of economic expansion and continued insolvencies and defaults among companies and banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing course from China’s current economic model requires a sharper slowdown in economic growth in the short term in order to catalyze different growth drivers in the medium term, as well as crowding in private capital to finance those sectors. Policymakers in Beijing understand this trade-off, even if the choices are unpalatable. If China engages in more significant structural reforms to its economy, growth must slow significantly in the near term because borrowers who depended upon the financial system to roll over debt and maintain less productive investment must be cut off from new credit. Those sectors of the economy must shrink over time. Only then can the financial system’s resources be redirected toward more productive forms of investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, reforming a financial system and an economy where the state retains an outsized role and influences prices and resource allocation is a complex process. While most available data in China support the argument that private companies invest far more efficiently than state firms, the fact that state firms are guaranteed by central or local governments and face no hard budget constraints means they can maintain access to credit. When overall credit growth slowed, private firms were squeezed while state firms continued to receive loans. Similarly, in general, when interest rates rise in such a semi-reformed system, state firms are insensitive to borrowing costs and can offer financial institutions superior terms relative to private firms. As a result, attempts to reduce systemic risks may produce more short-term risks of defaults and insolvencies and reduce the efficiency of investment in the entire economy. The consequences of reform in a financial system such as China’s are not easy to predict, nor can they easily be placed along an axis between greater market liberalization and greater state control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign reflects those efforts at structural reform in microcosm and the difficult trade-offs involved. Its successes and failures indicate the possibilities and limits of reform of China’s economy and financial system, as well as Beijing’s ability and capacity to respond to unsustainable trends within its own system and the influence of technocrats on China’s policymaking process. The key question currently facing observers of China’s economy is whether or not Beijing can change course and maintain past rates of economic growth using new drivers despite the headwinds China is currently facing. The deleveraging campaign is interesting as a test case of Chinese policymaking in response to systemic risks that materialized in the mid-2010s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years, China’s economy has been rocked by political intervention into economic policymaking, from crackdowns on internet platform companies such as Alibaba to Covid-19-related restrictions on activity to the effective closure of the private education and tutoring industry. The deleveraging campaign provides a window into whether or not technocrats within a one-party state can effectively execute long-term plans in the interest of China’s political leadership and long-term stability. It also can address the question of whether these political interventions are limited exceptions to more effective technocratic management of the economy or part of a longer-term trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the success or failure of China’s deleveraging campaign is central to the future of China’s economy. The core objective of the deleveraging campaign is to reduce risk within the financial system. It is impossible to consider the long-term growth of China’s economy without considering the nature of the financial system that will finance investment and consumption in the future. Similarly, longer-term growth in China depends upon an expansion in productivity, including the efficiency of the financial system in allocating capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic growth over the next 5 to 10 years will depend upon how successfully and efficiently the financial system can shift its resources away from property-related lending and local government investment projects toward more productive private sector firms. A country’s potential economic growth is typically measured by estimating or calculating future changes in inputs of labor and capital and the growth of productivity of those inputs, labeled as total factor productivity (TFP). China’s working-age population has been shrinking since around 2013, and urbanization rates are slowing. Therefore, its labor force is likely to continue declining in the future. Capital accumulation using the old model of growth has slowed for some time, as there are declining marginal returns to greater investment in the property sector and local government infrastructure. There is certainly more potential for investment and capital accumulation within China’s economy, but it depends upon a very different pattern of financing from what China has seen so far, with capital shifted to more productive industries. The productivity growth of those inputs, to a large extent, depends upon whether or not the financial system can be reformed and can redirect resources to more efficient and productive uses. Otherwise, China’s economic growth rates will continue to slow over the next decade to 2 percent or below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;competitions-of-systems&quot;&gt;Competitions of Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign’s success or failure also implicates global perceptions of China’s power and influence. One vision of China after deleveraging involves stable, technocratically oriented leadership capable of solving some of the most pressing challenges facing China’s economy while maintaining high rates of economic growth. This view suggests important advantages to China’s system of political organization with the CCP’s monopoly on political power. It also demonstrates China’s continued international influence and capacity to engage with its allies and aligned partners economically. Finally, this view suggests that challenges to China’s continued rise in global influence will not come from financial stress or the economy overall, given that Beijing effectively countered one of the most significant threats to China’s economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative narrative sees Beijing caught in an economic trap of its own making, unable to effectively reform its system or change course. As the deleveraging campaign and the collapse of the shadow banking system produced more and more defaults and credit risk in the financial system, lenders became far more risk averse, and Beijing was unable to control the volume of credit deployed in the economy. The property sector’s rapid decline dramatically weakened overall growth and eroded the wealth of the vast majority of Chinese households, whose primary assets were most often their homes. Moreover, many households owned multiple properties. This view suggests that the costs of China’s rapid pace of expansion over the previous decade were far higher, and that China’s leadership and technocrats could not successfully manage them. In short, economic gravity reasserted itself, and China reverted to the mean of other emerging markets where credit had expanded rapidly. Rather than serve as a model, China’s economic and political system was discredited in the eyes of the world, and China’s international influence correspondingly waned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these are just narratives, of course, within oppositional views concerning the competition of political systems. But much is at stake within the question of how the world perceives China’s technocratic competence and the stability of its economic model overall. The deleveraging campaign is the most meaningful available window into a complex but necessary technocratic decisionmaking process, and assessing the effects of the campaign can help to determine which future is more likely to emerge in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-current-state-of-risks-within-chinas-financial-system&quot;&gt;The Current State of Risks within China’s Financial System&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s financial system is currently under greater stress than ever, primarily because of the adjustment underway within the property market. Property industry–related lending in China totals roughly 73 trillion yuan ($10.7 trillion), including mortgages, loans to developers, and other informal borrowing. So far, most of the losses in the industry’s adjustment have been felt by developers who have defaulted, but this stress will eventually show up within financial institutions as well. Local governments are facing new fiscal pressures as a result of the decline in land sales, and there are growing risks that local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) will default on their publicly traded debt, which has not yet occurred. Ever since the deleveraging campaign launched in 2016, the slowdown in credit growth has exposed different types of borrowers to risks of default. Increasingly, within China’s system, these assets, such as the bonds issued by local state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and LGFVs, are considered “safer.” As the slowdown in credit growth has continued since the deleveraging campaign began to take hold, China’s economic growth has weakened as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examining the deleveraging campaign also provides the most coherent and parsimonious view into China’s ongoing and extended economic slowdown and what will be necessary to reverse it. In 2022, China’s economy grew at only 3 percent officially, but the actual growth rate was probably negative given the disruptions from lockdowns, travel restrictions, and the spread of Covid-19. In early 2023, optimism about the end of Covid-19 restrictions catalyzed anticipation of a much stronger rebound in China’s economy. But the slowdown China is currently facing has been ongoing for over six years and dates from the decline in overall credit growth and the unwinding of an unprecedented expansion in credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of credit growth to China’s economic expansion over the past two decades is discussed extensively in the 2018 report Credit and Credibility. From 2007 to 2016, China’s banking system expanded by $24.6 trillion in assets, or around one-third of global GDP, almost quadrupling over just eight years, as bank assets grew by an average of 18.1 percent. Since 2017, overall credit growth has been cut in half, and many borrowers, including state-owned and private sector firms, households, property developers, and local government enterprises, have consequently been unable to access new financing. The net result has been a significant slowdown in economic growth as firms reduce output or default, while household consumption has similarly declined. Previously, the expansion of China’s shadow banking system had provided access to borrowers underserved by the traditional system, but with those channels closing, consumer activity and many types of investment started to fall, significantly reducing China’s economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial risks also began to materialize as borrowers unable to refinance their debts created new credit risks in more and more asset classes. The riskiest financing structures, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending networks, started collapsing in 2018, touching off protests from angry investors in several cities. Smaller banks followed, with Baoshang Bank’s default in 2019, the first in over two decades, touching off several additional bank failures. Then, local state-owned firms started defaulting on bonds in larger proportions, with the default of Yongcheng Coal in November 2020 raising the possibility that local governments could actually create new credit risk rather than reduce it. Trust companies that aggregated investments from banks and wealthy individuals and lent to property developers were the next to default in 2020 and 2021, followed by an increasing number of developers. Finally, by 2022, individual home buyers were threatening to default on their mortgages as more developers were unable to complete houses they had sold in advance of construction. Credit risk had started in the riskier periphery of China’s financial system and had moved closer and closer to the center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s deleveraging campaign was the critical policy choice that set these events in motion, even if Beijing clearly did not intend some of these consequences. As a result, the deleveraging campaign is inseparable from China’s current economic slowdown, as well as the rising financial risks that threaten to accelerate the current downturn in credit and investment growth. But the deleveraging campaign also managed to limit different forms of financial risk tied to the funding of the banking system. Controlling shadow banks may have reduced the overall pace of credit growth but also may have moved credit back to more regulated forms, such that Beijing could influence the direction of finance in the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report aims to comprehensively assess China’s deleveraging campaign and its economic and political consequences, especially as they relate to China’s current economic slowdown and the adaptability and flexibility of the Chinese state to respond to meaningful challenges. The campaign reflected a series of policy choices, some involving monetary policy, some involving regulatory issues, and some involving public messaging or guidance. At each step, Beijing was forced to calibrate its response to avoid shocking the financial system as the PBOC had done during the 2013 interbank market crisis. In turn, the report aims to discuss the internal politics of China’s deleveraging campaign and the balance of bureaucratic and political interests that allowed it to develop and continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;plan-of-the-report&quot;&gt;Plan of the Report&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report provides a comprehensive assessment of the economic and political conditions that produced China’s deleveraging campaign and its implications for China’s current economic challenges. Chapter 1 explains the initial concerns facing China’s leaders after the fragility of the financial system was exposed during the June 2013 interbank market crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic background of China’s deleveraging campaign, the rapid expansion of China’s shadow banking system, and the corresponding emergence of systemic financial risks are the subject of Chapter 2. The banking system saw an unprecedented single-country credit expansion after the 2007–08 global financial crisis, and the core activities of the system — deposit taking and lending — changed rapidly. Moral hazard was widespread, as most lenders and investors assumed borrowers were guaranteed. This allowed the financial system to expand at unprecedented speed, with most lenders unconcerned about credit risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanics of the deleveraging campaign and the policy choices Beijing made to reduce risks within the shadow banking system are covered in Chapter 3. Starting in 2016 with a People’s Daily article from an “authoritative personage,” the campaign transitioned from monetary tightening steps to regulatory tightening measures, as well as controls on local government borrowing. Control over localities not only involved financial regulators but also an effort to promote much tougher fiscal discipline at the local level by the Ministry of Finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences of these measures within China’s financial system are discussed in Chapter 4. Using data from China’s banks and nonbank financial institutions, both individually and system-wide, the report discusses how the funding structures of China’s banks shifted away from WMPs toward more conventional deposits, as well as some of the unintended consequences of that shift. In addition, the chapter covers the changes in the lending activities of Chinese banks and nonbanks and the migration of shadow banking assets back to formal loan books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of these financial changes on the broader economy are the subject of Chapter 5, including the slowdown in credit growth and its impact on different types of borrowers, particularly low-income consumers, property developers, and local governments. Investment growth rates slowed significantly as shadow banks contracted, particularly among local governments in China’s interior and northeastern provinces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 6 analyzes the deleveraging campaign’s effects as they relate to Beijing’s objectives at the outset. The campaign significantly reduced some financial risks on the liabilities side of banks’ balance sheets, as intended, while unintentionally creating meaningful new credit risks on the asset side, slowing the economy significantly. These consequences emerged because Beijing was unaware of the size of the shadow banking system and the potential effects of contracting informal lending channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concluding chapter, Chapter 7, assesses the implications of the deleveraging campaign for Beijing’s capacity to respond to systemic risks, as well as the importance of technocratic influence within China’s policymaking process. In addition, it discusses the impact of the changes in China’s economy and financial system for China’s international influence, as well as the long-term growth of China’s economy. The report concludes with implications for the United States and other like-minded democratic countries in their relationships to China’s financial system, as well as the implications for global systemic competition between democratic and autocratic political systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-tree-cannot-grow-to-the-sky&quot;&gt;A Tree Cannot Grow to the Sky&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the 2007–08 global financial crisis, China launched a countercyclical stimulus program that catalyzed an unprecedented boom in credit growth. Over the next eight years, through the end of 2016, that credit expansion was larger as a proportion of global GDP (around 32 percent) than any single-country credit boom in at least a century. The stimulus effort, which was generally labeled China’s 4 trillion yuan package, was successful at stabilizing the economy via lending to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), property developers, and newly created local companies labeled as local government financing vehicles (LGFVs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual size of China’s stimulus was much larger than 4 trillion yuan ($588 billion), roughly 13 percent of China’s GDP at the time, because it was generally funded through lending from the banking system, rather than direct fiscal spending by government. Banks were encouraged to lend aggressively, and did so, to all types of borrowers but particularly those that were state-owned or guaranteed. Overall credit growth, measured via total social financing (TSF), skyrocketed by 32 percent in 2009 and a further 24 percent in 2010. Even after the economy had clearly stabilized and inflation picked up in 2011, credit growth barely slowed in China, posting 18 percent growth in 2011 and 19 percent in 2012. By the end of 2012, China’s banking system had more than doubled its total assets in only four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial risks naturally grew given the volume of credit growth deployed in such a short period. But for Beijing, the alternative to continuing credit growth would have been a sharp slowdown in the economy, as borrowers cut off from newly acquired credit would need to reduce output and employment. As a result, China’s leaders were still comfortable with the growing financial risks, as these reduced the political risks of a slowing economy, including rising unemployment. The financial system had served as a shock absorber, channeling resources to enterprises facing losses, in order to maintain output and prevent the types of economic adjustments that occurred in market economies, including defaults and bankruptcies. As a result, China’s overall debt burden and the corresponding financial risks increased, while political risks to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s leadership declined. Beijing could have stopped this process earlier, but China’s leadership and many local government officials likely were willing to live with these compromises — for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;a-brief-explanation-of-terms&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A BRIEF EXPLANATION OF TERMS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Wealth management products (WMPs):&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WMPs are investment products sold mainly by banks to pool money from retail investors. They typically feature short-term maturities (less than a year) and implicit guarantees from the issuer (though new regulations have phased out these guarantees). Most significantly, they offered higher returns compared with deposit rates. Initially, small banks offered these funds at higher rates to compete with larger banks for funding. Regulators viewed WMPs as instruments of reform and more market-oriented liability tools for banks. Later, WMPs became the key source of funding for the shadow banking business and have faced a severe crackdown since the new asset management rules introduced in 2018. Since that time, shadow banking activities have declined sharply. The outstanding balance of banks’ WMPs totaled 29.15 trillion yuan ($4.3 trillion) at the end of June 2022.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Shadow banking:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The broader definition of shadow banking usually refers to financial services similar to those that traditional banks offer but which are provided by nonbank financial institutions outside the regulatory structure of the formal banking system. China’s shadow banking business is unique because a large portion of this finance is still sourced from banks themselves, with banks moving assets on or off their balance sheets in different forms (depending upon regulatory changes). The shadow banking business in China evolved to bypass regulatory restrictions so that banks could continue to lend to property developers and local governments, as well as other restricted borrowers. Later, banks found additional benefits to shadow banking activity, such as expanding leverage, preserving capital, and concealing nonperforming loans (NPLs). A 2020 working paper from China’s Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) generally defines shadow banking to include WMPs, banks’ interbank WMPs, interbank special purpose vehicle (SPV) investments, entrusted loans, trust loans, nonequity public funds, asset management service of brokerages and insurance companies, asset-backed securities, nonequity forms of private equity financing, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, leasing, lending by microfinance companies, factoring, consumption loans by non-licensed institutions, and debt products issued at local financial exchanges.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs):&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In China, NBFIs are mainly trust firms, brokerages, funds (public and private), insurance companies, finance firms of large SOEs, or other small firms, from leasing to factoring companies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;P2P platforms pool money from retail investors and then lend to retail investors as consumption loans. Initially, P2P firms provided real benefits in providing financial services to underserved households and helped boost consumption. Later, these businesses featured aggressive competition as platforms raced to offer exorbitantly high interest rates to attract more funds. These rates were so high that they could not be repaid out of existing investments, and many of the platforms were exposed as Ponzi schemes. The number of P2P platforms peaked in 2015 and then declined as the regulatory environment turned unfriendly, until all P2P platforms closed in 2020.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Trust companies:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Two financial institutions have full lending licenses in China: banks and trust firms. These lending licenses have helped trust firms become the largest of the three primary channels for banks to shift money into shadow banking (the other two are brokerages and funds). Even during the early stage of deleveraging, when both brokerages and funds’ shadow banking business lines were shrinking, trust firms were still expanding. Trust companies can also pool money from retail investors by selling trust products. Beijing has provided only 71 trust licenses and has stopped providing new ones. Currently, there are 68 trust firms in operation and 21 trillion yuan ($3.1 trillion) in assets under management, according to data from the China Trustee Association.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Implicit guarantees:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Implicit guarantees refer to the belief that many forms of borrowing in China cannot default, which is rapidly coming into question. Specifically, this refers to guarantees behind Chinese bonds in the interbank market and WMP products for retail investors. In the bond market, the only corporate bonds that have not officially defaulted (outside of quasi-government bonds such as those railways and banks issue) are LGFV bonds, though there have been occasional technical defaults on these bonds). In the WMP market, trust products have defaulted frequently. Although banks’ WMPs have failed to deliver promised returns, they have not defaulted outright yet.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Repo rates:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Repo rates are interest rates on collateralized interbank borrowing among banks and NBFIs within pledged repo transactions of China’s interbank market.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Maturity mismatch:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This refers to financial institutions pooling money using short-term funding instruments on the liabilities side of the balance sheet in order to purchase long-term assets. The funding instruments must be rolled over continually, generating refinancing risks. Banking regulators have introduced three liquidity indicators to reduce these maturity mismatches by discouraging short-term borrowing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs):&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NCDs are a primary source of wholesale funding for banks introduced at the end of 2013. WMPs allow banks to pool money from retail investors, but in the years before internet financing was developed, small banks’ access to retail investors was still limited, even though they could offer high returns. NCDs are different, as they allow a bank, no matter how small, to borrow money from every bank around the country by selling a product backed only by the bank’s creditworthiness (whereas repo borrowing requires collateral). In the early years, NCDs were not included as a proportion of banks’ interbank liabilities, which are limited to one-third of the total. In 2018, this loophole was closed, and tougher regulations were introduced for NCDs in the course of the broader deleveraging campaign.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enter-shadow-banks&quot;&gt;Enter Shadow Banks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the investment projects that China’s local governments financed following the global financial crisis were not necessarily designed to generate financial returns that could repay the loans. Banks were simply a mechanism to channel credit into the economy more quickly than waiting for large-scale government bond issuance. As a result, banks had a problem in lending to guaranteed borrowers, who still needed more money to continue their investments. Banks had no incentive to cut off these projects because the state implicitly or explicitly guaranteed the loans. Canceling loans would generate immediate fiscal costs, and banks would see their profitability decline because of the need for new provisions against bad debt. But the loans were not technically performing, which could create liquidity problems if banks suddenly faced withdrawal of deposits or other liabilities. These scenarios were exactly what occurred during the June 2013 interbank market crisis (the basic problems that developed within the banking system are discussed in detail in Chapter 2 of Credit and Credibility).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth of the shadow banking system emerged as a partial solution to banks’ difficulties maintaining these loans to state-owned and local government borrowers as performing assets, so banks did not need to mark the loans down in value. China controlled the growth of lending through blunt regulatory instruments — including outright quotas for individual banks (these are still used to some extent), ceilings on deposit rates, and floors on lending rates — to guarantee banks a fixed net interest margin and profitability. The deposit rate ceilings were also designed to prevent banks from raising short-term interest rates to attract additional financing, competing with other banks for funding and increasing the overall level of risk in the financial system. Broader loan-to-deposit ratios were imposed around 75 percent for most banks to ensure that funding was sufficient to cover potentially risky lending. Before 2012, these tools were very blunt but generally effective in China’s financial system. In 2009 and 2010, Beijing was eager to expand credit and investment and relaxed lending quotas and guidance to local governments. After the initial postcrisis stimulus, localities were eager to continue borrowing and investing at the same pace, so they created mechanisms to avoid Beijing’s restrictions via shadow banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks gradually channeled more and more of their funding into shadow banking channels outside of their formal loan books. Because they could not compete with one another by raising deposit rates, they would channel funds as an investment into a WMP, which would then invest the funds into a third-party financial institution such as a trust company or asset management company. The trust company, unburdened by the same sets of regulations and quotas governing bank loans, could then lend to the final borrower. This effectively moved what was traditionally a straightforward loan into an off-balance-sheet asset, in which the bank holds a claim on the third-party shadow banking institution, or NBFI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow banks offered local governments and SOEs a way to keep borrowing and investing to fund ongoing projects even after Beijing stepped in to limit credit growth following the postcrisis stimulus. A shadow bank or NBFI would provide a higher-interest bridge loan to a borrower for a short time, perhaps even less than one month. The bridge loan would be used to repay the older bank loan that needed to be rolled over. Then the bank could extend the borrower a larger new loan based on solid recent credit history. The new loan could be used to repay the shadow bank loan with both principal and interest. And the bank could still mark the loan as performing since the old loan had been repaid in full and a new loan had been granted. Sometimes bank loan officers themselves managed these shadow banks, allowing the officers to profit personally from the rollover process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow banking not only facilitated new lending to state-owned borrowers but also allowed banks to circumvent regulations on lending to certain types of borrowers, particularly property developers and LGFVs. As regulators attempted to curtail these practices and created specific limits on trust companies or other lenders, forms of credit quickly evolved to circumvent the regulations. The lending was profitable, and borrowers were willing to pay higher interest rates because they were either cut off from other forms of credit or insensitive to borrowing costs (such as local governments). As a result, shadow banks quickly expanded in an economy that had seen an explosion of credit growth, where politicians, local governments, banks, and borrowers all wanted growth to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another function of shadow banking was to restructure the form of lending so banks could expand credit and profits by a larger margin, even if they could not expand their capital bases. Regulators applied higher risk weightings and corresponding capital requirements on loans than on short-term claims on other financial institutions, which were considered safer. As a result, banks had incentives to restructure loans as different types of assets, either by hiding them entirely off their balance sheet or by representing them as a different form of credit, such as an “investment receivable” or an “interbank entrusted payment.” The complexity of these systems grew throughout the expansion of the shadow banks. But the overall purpose was simply to maintain credit to preferred borrowers and to continue profitable lines of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there were new problems that shadow banks created as well. In offering short-term WMPs to retail investors, banks were often competing with one another explicitly via interest rates, which meant they also needed to find borrowers who were willing to pay higher rates. These borrowers were generally property developers who could afford higher borrowing costs because of their high gross margins and local governments who were not sensitive to borrowing costs because they faced no budget constraints. While lending to these sectors was more lucrative, channeling new credit to these areas also meant less credit to the rest of the economy. Developers and local governments’ implicit guarantees essentially made lending to these firms risk-free for several years and lifted the overall borrowing costs of the entire economy. Ultimately, high borrowing costs were one of the most important reasons behind the rise in defaults in recent years. One key goal of deleveraging was to reduce borrowing costs for the entire economy, especially for local governments. Given that LGFVs generate returns on assets of less than 2 percent, they can barely manage a 3 percent interest rate, while many of these firms were actually borrowing at shadow bank interest rates as high as 10 percent. At rates this high, new borrowing from LGFVs is necessary just to service older debts, rather than initiating new investments. Reporting to the National People’s Congress (NPC) in December 2015 after the first year of the local government bond swap program, Finance Minister Lou Jiwei commented that the program helped to reduce localities’ borrowing costs from 10 percent to 3.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the loans that shadow banking institutions made were longer in duration than the WMPs, which were often only one month or three months. But banks issuing WMPs now had a new problem: they needed to keep rolling over this funding, which came from retail investors, corporate depositors, and other banks. Moreover, the financial system as a whole became riskier, as shadow banks were forced to extend loans to borrowers willing to pay higher interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;moral-hazard-and-rapid-shadow-banking-growth&quot;&gt;Moral Hazard and Rapid Shadow Banking Growth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central to the growth of shadow banking was the widespread moral hazard throughout the financial system. Moral hazard refers to a condition in which decisionmakers or investors either seek out additional risk or avoid managing risk because they believe they are protected from losses. Several factors contributed to the development of moral hazard within China’s financial system, but the most important was Chinese authorities’ continued interventions to stabilize markets in the event of any financial instability or widespread losses. Chapter 6 of Credit and Credibility discusses this phenomenon and the pattern of government intervention in far greater detail. Most Chinese citizens and investors in China’s financial markets understood that the CCP was highly averse to perceived political instability. If financial losses among shadow banking products materialized, they were likely to generate protests and social discontent. Beijing had clearly established a precedent to intervene and minimize financial losses as a mechanism to avoid political dissent. Financial risk thus continued rising as a tool to minimize political risk to the party’s rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state’s outsized role within China’s economy was one of the most important contributors to the perception that virtually all assets within China’s financial system were guaranteed. SOEs face soft budget constraints and often receive subsidies directly from fiscal resources in order to continue operating. Lending to SOEs is therefore seen as entirely safe because the state must support these borrowers regardless of the level of debt they accrue. Banks typically are happy to lend to state-owned borrowers and will do so until they hit lending quotas, as the profitability of such loans is basically guaranteed. Even if the borrower cannot repay its debt, the state will presumably ensure the company’s solvency. Loan officers also face personal incentives for lending to state firms. A loan officer could be personally blamed for losses incurred by lending to private firms, whereas lending to SOEs would be viewed as a job requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compound this issue, banks themselves are state owned in China, so borrowing between banks is also perceived to be entirely guaranteed. Even during the interbank market crisis in June 2013, banks stopped lending to the market not because they thought their counterparties would suddenly declare bankruptcy but because they were concerned the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) would not provide enough liquidity in the short term to engage in regular business. These guarantees on banks created incentives for loan officers to transform riskier loans into claims on banks themselves by borrowing or lending to banks using the riskier assets as collateral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can easily see how credit could expand rapidly in a situation in which the state guaranteed both borrowers and lenders. But there are also more fundamental limits to how fast credit and debt can grow relative to the size of China’s economy. As the People’s Daily diagnosed China’s debt problem in May 2016, “A tree cannot grow to the sky.” Figure 2.1 illustrates the key problem with a rapidly rising corporate debt burden, even if it is SOEs that are borrowing: significant quantities of new credit must be used to service older debt, so every yuan of new credit no longer generates the same economic activity as in the past. Cash flows and savings that fund investment are distributed unevenly throughout the economy, but the annual interest on credit, estimated using average quarterly borrowing rates from the PBOC, has exceeded nominal GDP growth every year since 2012. An International Monetary Fund working paper published in early 2018 concerning China’s credit booms notes that in 2007–08, 6.5 trillion yuan ($950 billion) in new credit growth boosted nominal GDP by 5 trillion yuan ($735 billion). In 2015–16, 20 trillion yuan ($2.9 trillion) in credit was needed to create the same marginal GDP growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2012, conditions were set for a rapid expansion of credit, with shadow banks playing an increasingly important role in the process. At first, regulators were loath to crack down on shadow banking activities because both WMPs and lending via NBFIs were viewed as instruments of financial system reform. By competing for funding with banks, many Chinese officials thought WMPs played a role in interest rate liberalization, which was a long-held goal of financial reformers. Furthermore, riskier lenders such as P2P networks were playing an important role in expanding access to financial services to lower-income households and small private businesses that had previously been cut off from the state-owned banking system. There were many reasons for Chinese authorities to tread cautiously in regulating these institutions, which also allowed them to grow quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2012 to 2016, informal or nonbank lending expanded by at least 36.7 trillion yuan ($5.3 trillion), representing around 31 percent of total credit extended over those five years (the shadow lending components are represented by the dark blue area of Figure 2.2). Much of this was borrowed by property developers, local governments, and speculators and ended up fueling a number of asset bubbles in property, stocks, and commodities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mz24Bzt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow banks significantly complicated the traditional operations of China’s financial system. In order to generate additional returns and repay investors at higher interest rates, lenders had to take additional risks in extending loans to borrowers that were not guaranteed. The fact that the state-guaranteed banks meant they felt comfortable guaranteeing WMPs offered to their customers, even if those WMPs were making very risky loans to borrowers that could default. The assumption was that the banks themselves would simply pay the losses from risky loans out of their own funds and continue to provide their customers with high rates of return. Otherwise, the investor could shift to another bank. In turn, trust companies, asset management companies, and other NBFIs felt comfortable lending to local governments and LGFVs at high rates because the NBFIs often boasted some degree of state ownership as well, usually by local governments. The assumption of widespread government guarantees on both borrowers and lenders led to a significant expansion of system-wide financial risks, as shadow banks started to become almost one-third of overall lending from 2012 to 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-great-ball-of-money&quot;&gt;The Great Ball of Money&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aftermath of the interbank market crisis in June 2013 set the stage for a wave of bubbles in China’s financial and asset markets. Even as the banking system came to the brink of collapse in 2013, investors, depositors, and bankers essentially called the PBOC’s bluff, as the dramatic sell-off forced the PBOC to inject sizable amounts of liquidity and calm the money markets. Rather than a “flight to quality” in which investors sought out safe assets, the rise in interest rates encouraged investors to engage in a “flight to risk,” sinking funds into higher-interest WMPs, knowing the banks issuing them would need to guarantee their returns. In order to prevent the crisis from repeating itself later, the PBOC needed to manage short-term interbank market rates far more carefully to avoid spikes that might trigger additional redemptions of WMPs and a spiral in short-term rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many internet finance companies that became dominant in China over the next decade, such as Alibaba and Tencent, started in this field during the aftermath of the June 2013 interbank market crisis. They offered their customers high returns and encouraged depositors to shift funds from banks to internet-based funds simply by reinvesting the funds raised on their platforms in the interbank market at even higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These conditions were conducive to a wave of financial speculation, indirectly encouraged by the PBOC. By intervening regularly to keep money market rates low and stable, the central bank encouraged shadow banks not only to borrow aggressively in the money markets at low rates but also to add leverage to their positions in order to generate yield. Soon, virtually anything that could generate yield in China’s financial system was seeing an influx of money channeled from banks via WMPs into third-party lenders. NBFIs became the largest borrowers within China’s money markets, larger than even city or rural commercial banks (Figure 2.3). This surplus liquidity was often labeled China’s “great ball of money,” rocketing from one speculative market to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/89khrji.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.3: Borrowers and Lenders in Pledged Repo Market, Total Turnover, 2013–2016.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: Borrowing reflected in positive totals, lending in negative totals. Source: PBOC quarterly monetary policy reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first obvious source of speculative activity in 2012 was the property market. China’s property market was the largest individual asset market in the country, and there were powerful forces motivating speculation in housing. Prices had risen dramatically ever since the liberalization of the housing market in the late 1990s. The few setbacks in 2008 and 2011 were only six to nine months in duration, usually viewed as an opportunity to pile back into the sector. Developers were able to borrow liberally from shadow banks, bypassing limits on borrowing for land purchases. As a result, land prices continued rising, with developers then pushing up housing costs to maintain margins. Most investors thought that the sector was simply “too big to fail,” given the importance of property to China’s overall economic growth and localities’ reliance upon land sales revenues. The symbiotic relationship between developers and localities encouraged increases in construction and housing purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2014, however, the excesses within the sector were readily apparent. Numerous stories circulated in media concerning ghost towns as developers built outside of major cities far in excess of fundamental demand. Beijing launched a shantytown redevelopment program to resettle residents living in older homes by encouraging them to buy from the ample stocks of housing. Trust companies started to face defaults on loans to developers and reduced lending to the sector, which was one cause of a widespread slowdown in the economy in 2014 and 2015 led by weaker property construction. Steel and other commodity prices dropped sharply, but the output of raw materials did not because most firms were able to roll over their loans, in part by using shadow banking channels. As a result, China started to face significant deflationary pressures in producer prices, which stayed negative for four consecutive years, from 2012 to 2016. While producer prices were negative, consumer prices fluctuated but generally grew. This can be most easily explained by the fact that most credits went to state-owned producers, who continued operating even if profits were declining because they were trying to avoid job cuts and potential political instability. In November 2014, the central bank started cutting interest rates to reduce real borrowing costs for firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the property sector weakened significantly in 2014, the great ball of money shifted to China’s equity market. The Shanghai Composite Index began rising in late 2014, but there seemed to be little macroeconomic logic behind the move. With the economy flagging, led by the property sector, many expected policymakers would step in to support growth, but there has been little evidence of such support so far. China’s equity markets had long been likened to casinos, but part of the reason for their volatility was the investor base, which consisted of far more retail investors and momentum traders than fundamental investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China’s equity markets were highly responsive to policy changes and liquidity conditions, it was the liquidity conditions and speculative activity that drove most of the epic boom and bust in China’s stock market in 2015, which then forced Chinese leadership to respond to stem the market’s rapid descent. Margin trading was facilitated by lending from shadow banks, which expanded rapidly throughout the early months of 2015. Nie Qingping, the ex-chairman of the China Securities Finance Corporation (CSFC), the very vehicle Beijing used to bail out the stock market in 2015, said that the more than 3 trillion yuan ($440 billion) from banks’ WMPs was fueling margin trading in the stock market. As share prices rose, investors pledged the shares they had just purchased as collateral for additional margin loans (Figure 2.4). Naturally, when prices declined, this exacerbated the decline in share values. The collapse was so rapid that Beijing was forced to buy around 2 trillion yuan ($294 billion) in stocks using the CSFC to attempt to prevent a more dramatic sell-off. More direct interventions included prohibitions on short selling and security forces starting to investigate the causes of the sell-off. Since 2015, China’s stock prices have not rebounded to the levels where Chinese authorities decided to buy large volumes of stocks to stabilize the market. Most of the funds allowed speculators to exit the market, and the property market stabilized again as investors moved from the equity market back into housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2016, the frenzy spread to commodities markets, and trading in Chinese commodities futures started to exceed trading volumes on all Chinese equities exchanges and even the Nasdaq at its dot-com-era peak in 2000. Short-term money market rates were extremely stable at around 2 percent, which allowed NBFIs to take risks in a number of different assets. Corporate bonds were also bought aggressively on leverage, as an environment of lower interest rates and a weaker Chinese economy meant very few types of assets could actually generate the returns necessary to repay WMP investors. Leveraged bets were therefore necessary, and corporate bond spreads to risk-free assets dropped to all-time lows. P2P lending networks popped up around China, borrowing from individuals at high rates and lending at even higher rates. Many of the borrowers from P2P platforms were small private businesses and lower-income households borrowing for down payments for mortgage loans. The great ball of money just rolled on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regulatory-whack-a-mole&quot;&gt;Regulatory Whack-a-Mole&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious question that emerges from these stories of financial speculation is why regulators did not notice the risks building and respond more quickly. Bureaucratic factors explain some of the regulatory oversight, in part because no regulator could see the whole picture. Shadow banking activity had grown precisely to avoid regulatory oversight. As a result, regulators struggled to understand the size of total shadow banking activity. In 2012, individual Chinese institutions had narrow regulatory mandates, with the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) covering banks and trust companies, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) covering securities companies, and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) regulating insurance firms. So, when regulations on one form of lending emerged, such as prohibitions on banks cooperating directly with trust companies in 2010, banks would simply shift their channel business to a different type of NBFI governed by a different regulator. Shadow banking was seemingly no one’s responsibility, and regulators could see only individual pieces of a rapidly developing puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the deleveraging campaign, there were several iterations of this game of whack-a-mole with different forms of shadow banking activity. In April 2014, for example, all five financial regulators in China, led by the PBOC, issued Circular No. 127, which meaningfully limited banks’ ability to conceal loans and other assets as collateral within interbank transactions. But the net effect was simply for banks to shift shadow banking activity to other classifications, including “investment receivables” and “directional asset management plans.” Until the deleveraging campaign started, all of these controls focused on the lenders rather than the funding sources — the WMPs themselves. This changed with the imposition of new asset management rules in 2018, which were one of the most significant elements of Beijing’s deleveraging effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, regulators themselves were not always interested in quickly controlling asset growth within their particular areas of jurisdiction. While they were keen to avoid systemic financial risks from developing (and potentially taking the blame for them), many local governments and state-owned firms clearly benefited from the expansion of shadow financing activities. Regulators within individual financial sectors had incentives to grow their industries as well as to expand their industries’ imprints within the economy. Regulators often competed with one another to grow their sectors’ overall asset bases, which would make their areas of jurisdiction more significant within the economy. One of the justifications for the deleveraging campaign was to address this patchwork of controls over shadow banking activities in China’s financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;attention-must-be-paid&quot;&gt;Attention Must Be Paid&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of China’s financial system changed significantly between 2012 and 2016. Before 2012, China’s bank-centric financial system was generally inefficient but stable. The banks’ funding was primarily concentrated in deposits from both households and corporations. Those state-owned banks then lent predominantly to SOEs, which inefficiently invested the capital relative to more efficient private firms. China generally posted surpluses in its international balance of payments, and as a result, there were more deposits flowing into the system most of the time. Banks seldom needed to compete for funding against one another. The system may have been lethargic, but it seemed highly resistant to a system-wide crisis. Beijing had made choices to deliberately prioritize stability over efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2016, the entire structure of China’s financial system had changed. Marginal funding growth for the banking system came from WMPs or other non-deposit instruments rather than deposits. Banks needed to compete against one another for funding by offering higher and higher interest rates, which required them to take additional risks in lending to earn higher returns. As a result, banks’ marginal lending decisions were more likely to be placed with a third-party asset manager, such as a trust company, an asset management firm, or a brokerage, rather than a conventional loan. In addition, China faced significant changes in its international payments, with periods of strong inflows and strong outflows. Banks’ deposit levels fluctuated more regularly, making them more reliant upon the interbank money market for funding and requiring them to constantly compete for deposits and WMP funding. All of these developments made the financial system not only far more unstable but also far more difficult for Beijing to control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2016, Beijing was losing one of its primary policy levers to control the economy — the allocation of credit — because banks were engaging in regulatory arbitrage and shifting money to the shadow banking system. Far from controlling flows of credit, Chinese regulators were struggling to monitor where money was going within the financial system. Most forms of shadow banking existed to deliberately avoid government regulations on capital risk weightings or to hide lending to restricted borrowers such as LGFVs or property developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the changing structure of the system was generating significant financial risks. The off-balance-sheet structures that banks were using, which involved channeling money from depositors and investors into opaque off-balance-sheet vehicles, appeared very similar to the SPVs and special investment vehicles (SIVs) that had been exposed at U.S. banks during the 2007–08 global financial crisis. Banks were still likely to bear some risk if the investments defaulted because they would have reputational risks to their customers. Most customers thought the investments were essentially guaranteed because there were very few historical defaults. The investments continued becoming riskier and riskier because banks and NBFIs needed to seek higher returns to pay their investors higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire financial system appeared to be subsidized by the state as well, with private investors capable of generating strong returns from WMPs while any losses on shadow bank loans would be backstopped by local or central government. China had shifted from a system of financial repression, in which depositors had little control over where to place their money, to a system of widespread moral hazard. Both the liabilities and assets sides of banks’ balance sheets were becoming riskier, and the actors contributing to that risk assumed the state would ultimately provide support if any losses materialized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politically, this was an enormous challenge for Beijing. Most Chinese officials had no intention of ever subsidizing losses in risky lending schemes such as P2P networks or property market speculation. But popular belief in the government’s guarantees was strong. Delivering a public message that losses on these risky investments were probable would shock financial markets accustomed to government intervention to stabilize conditions. It would risk repeating the consequences of the PBOC’s message to banks to rely upon themselves during the interbank market crisis in 2013. Losses might spark protests among angry investors. But larger losses from rapidly expanding financial bubbles were even more probable if the system kept expanding in the same fashion as it had from 2012 to 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the situation facing Beijing in 2016 when Chinese authorities decided to launch the deleveraging campaign. The financial system was no longer a shock absorber that allowed the party to manage political risks. It was starting to create political risks on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beijing-declares-war-on-shadow-banks&quot;&gt;Beijing Declares War on Shadow Banks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;averting-a-looming-crisis&quot;&gt;Averting a Looming Crisis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s primary fear in 2016 was that if the financial system continued growing at such a rapid rate and in the same unregulated fashion, more financial bubbles would start to burst, similar to what had just taken place in the equity market the previous year. Those bubbles could potentially have much greater political fallout, particularly in the property market, given high homeownership rates in China. Party leadership was forced to contemplate difficult choices about how to slow the growth of overall debt and shrink the shadow banking system without affecting the broader economy too severely, which could trigger unemployment and social discontent. Furthermore, they needed to avoid rapid and dramatic changes in policy that might trigger a rerun of the June 2013 interbank market crisis or another financial market contagion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign started with a high-profile interview with an “authoritative personage” published on May 9, 2016, in the People’s Daily, the CCP’s newspaper. Often, significant policy changes in China begin with a high-level message from leadership, usually via state media channels, including the People’s Daily. This communicates key policy messages internally, within China’s bureaucracy so that party cadres understand new priorities. The interview occupied almost the entire section below the front-page fold and filled the entire second page as well. It outlined a remarkable critique of the pattern of China’s growth seen from 2012 to 2016 and the limits of China’s traditional policy tools to stabilize the economy: “Economic stabilization relies on the old method, which is investment-driven, and fiscal pressure in some areas has added up to possibilities of economic risks.” Clearly identifying leverage and debt as the culprits, the quasi-official voice argued, “A tree cannot grow to the sky, and high leverage carries high risks. Mishandled, it will lead to a systemic financial crisis, causing an economic recession, and even lead the people’s savings to fizzle out, which would be dangerous. This comparison shows us where the emphasis of the work must be — there cannot be additional leverage in order to stimulate the economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many suspected the voice in the People’s Daily article was Liu He, then deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission and the leading official managing economic and financial affairs, or the collective voice of his office at the Central Economic and Financial Leading Group. The commentary not only inveighed against more traditional forms of stimulus using local government investment by calling for more significant financial reform but also commented that leverage is the “original sin” and a “source of high financial risks,” which amplified potential risks in movements of the exchange rate, as well as property and capital markets. The voice warned, “Big stimulus will only result in bubbles, which is a must-learn lesson.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interview focused extensively on setting expectations for lower economic growth in the near future and avoiding the short-term thinking that had dominated stimulus efforts for the economy up to that point. By identifying leverage as the core problem facing China’s financial system, the article created political space for financial technocrats to start producing concrete proposals to cut debt levels throughout the system. Fundamentally, the deleveraging campaign was about targeting the shadow banking sector — both in terms of lending and bank funding activities. China’s leadership merely wanted to reduce the potential for systemic financial risks that might create political problems. China’s financial technocrats faced a more difficult challenge in reducing banks’ reliance upon the specific channels for borrowing and lending that had evaded regulatory controls thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-deleveraging&quot;&gt;Why “Deleveraging”?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign was successfully launched only because the concept of “deleveraging” itself could be interpreted differently depending on a range of political objectives. Structural reform was difficult because entrenched interests had always maintained the system as it was. Local governments continued to rely upon easy credit to fund new investments, maintaining employment and growth. Property prices continued to rise, incentivizing new purchases and land development. Banks had few incentives to declare losses individually in order to keep growing. Maintaining a political coalition in favor of controlling the growth of the financial system and overall credit was a difficult challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, deleveraging is about the reduction of China’s debt levels over time. China’s aggregate debt burden started expanding rapidly in 2009 with the postcrisis stimulus, labeled as a 4 trillion yuan ($588 billion) investment package, which was in reality far larger, as previously discussed. Most significantly, local governments led this stimulus effort and funded it via the banking system rather than out of fiscal revenues. The International Monetary Fund’s Global Financial Stability Report placed China’s debt-to-GDP ratio at 254 percent in 2016, up from only 142 percent in 2006. China’s nonfinancial corporate sector debt at the time was equivalent to 165 percent of GDP, the highest among major economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the deleveraging campaign was not simply about reducing debt, as it was primarily focused on mitigating overall financial risks. As a result, virtually any program to reduce perceived financial risks could effectively be wrapped in the guise of the broader deleveraging campaign. The high-level endorsements of these objectives by the authoritative personage in the People’s Daily and subsequent Politburo statements would help to reinforce the leadership’s support for these objectives. Many goals of the deleveraging campaign were advanced by different interest groups within China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PnmctvV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For purely financial technocrats, such as those at the central bank and banking regulator, deleveraging narrowly represented an attempt to reduce the potential financial risks associated with high and rapidly growing debt-to-GDP and credit-to-GDP ratios (Figure 3.1). For these technocrats, any opportunity to control overall credit growth was welcome. But for advocates of the interests of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the deleveraging push provided an opportunity to reduce the debt burdens on SOE balance sheets so that SOEs could operate more freely in the future with less concern for the broader consequences for system-wide financial stability. For economic planners more focused on China’s long-term growth trajectory, the deleveraging effort also took aim at an obstacle to maintaining targeted growth rates in the form of the servicing costs of China’s existing debt. The Politburo’s support for deleveraging and high-level messages in support of that goal allowed all of these camps to push forward with their own objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these steps in combination reflected a campaign within China’s political structure — not a Western political campaign in advance of a democratic election but a style of Chinese politics that involves the mobilization of bureaucratic institutions toward particular targets or objectives using propaganda and persistent messaging. Early versions of these campaigns in the 1950s and 1960s attempted to generate mass participation in political movements because of the lack of effective bureaucratic institutions in China’s system at the time. Modern campaigns are more about mobilizing bureaucracies and communicating top leadership priorities meant to change lower-level officials’ behavior. The fervor of the high-level commitment from leadership reinforces lower-level officials’ attempts to comply with the needs of the campaign. However, campaign-style governance limits policy bandwidth because officials can only be focused intensely on a few issues at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s Politburo regularly issues statements following its near-quarterly meetings on economic work, and these are often interpreted as important signals of the CCP leadership’s priorities and intentions when it comes to economic policy. Immediately following the authoritative personage interview in the People’s Daily, Politburo’s statements started to emphasize the importance of deleveraging-related objectives. In late October 2016, the Politburo commented that China needed to “curb asset bubbles and safeguard against economic and financial risks.” The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) released quarterly monetary policy reports as well, and in the fourth quarter of 2016, the report focused heavily on the property market, with several references to the pernicious effects of “bubbles” and the need to limit the overall credit impulse to contain financial speculation. The central bank used the word “bubble” 16 times in the 2016 fourth-quarter report (versus 7 times in the previous report). Within the PBOC’s monetary policy reports, special columns command the most attention because they are inserted entirely at the discretion of PBOC staff to discuss timely and unusual policy issues. The fourth-quarter report features a special column discussing the relationship between asset prices, monetary policy, and property prices. It argues that macro-prudential policy alone is not enough to curb asset bubbles, which in fact requires establishing a new policy framework with two pillars: monetary policy and macro-prudential policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a Politburo statement in April 2017 emphasizing the importance of financial security, China’s official Xinhua News Agency published seven commentaries over the course of a week in early May 2017 calling for upgraded regulation of the financial sector and urging financial institutions to take their own responsibility in improving risk controls. The commentaries also pledged to address risks and require local governments to cooperate with central government efforts in order to better serve the real economy. The lead commentary linked financial security with national security, arguing, “Financial security is defined as ‘an important issue of governing the country,’ suggesting it is an issue concerning the overall development plan of the CPC and the country, the country’s economic and social development and national security work. Everyone needs to have a full understanding of this.” These were strong signals of support for both monetary tightening and regulation from China’s highest leadership, and these policy signals were unlikely to be reversed quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also held a significant meeting concerning financial work every five years, typically labeled as the National Financial Work Conference (NFWC). Previous conferences had proposed fundamental changes to China’s financial system, including the bailouts and restructurings of state-owned banks following the Asian financial crisis. Following the conference held in July 2017, the Xinhua News Agency published an aggressive 3,300-word story using the word risk 28 times and regulation 22 times and describing deleveraging as a long-term campaign. In addition, the leadership used new rhetoric to point out the importance of controlling financial “aggregates,” suggesting that the overall growth of the financial sector was emerging as a key benchmark for the success of deleveraging. Politburo statements supporting deleveraging continued for several quarters, as the December 2017 statement claimed that leverage should be effectively controlled, the financial sector should better support the real economy, and a higher priority should be placed on reducing risks. The Politburo statement referenced three major “battles,” which included controlling financial risks, fighting poverty, and reducing pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These leadership messages clearly provided political space for many bureaucratic agencies to advance their own efforts in support of the deleveraging campaign. But politically, it was difficult for financial technocrats to maintain momentum to reduce aggregate debt and credit. A more aggressive and vocal regulatory effort from other agencies risked generating too much attention and internal political opposition from all of the local governments and SOEs that required ongoing access to credit. For many years, the PBOC tried to implement smaller, quieter, and more incremental tightening steps that required fewer internal approvals but eventually produced changes in incentives in order to try to reduce risky behavior within the financial system. But with other institutions such as the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) and China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) turning up the political volume on the deleveraging campaign, there was a growing risk of alarm among banks, local governments, and potentially higher-level political leaders. Ultimately, the PBOC led the first salvoes in the extended battle against shadow banks by tightening monetary conditions and raising short-term money market rates. But they had to tread cautiously to avoid generating systemic financial risks as they had in June 2013. And they also had to avoid generating any internal political perception that the deleveraging campaign was slowing the economy significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;monetary-tightening&quot;&gt;Monetary Tightening&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the May 2016 People’s Daily interview and rhetoric from China’s political leaders, the first actions in the deleveraging campaign came from the PBOC, China’s central bank. Banks had seen a significant change in their funding structures from 2012 to 2016 and were much more dependent upon funding from wealth management products (WMPs). In addition, more banks and nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) were borrowing aggressively from the short-term repo market in order to place leveraged bets in more speculative asset markets and boost returns. This meant that banks and NBFIs were far more vulnerable to changes in short-term funding conditions in China’s money markets. If repo rates suddenly moved higher or became even more volatile, it became far riskier to sustain leveraged positions in risky assets because a change in funding costs could quickly push those positions into losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PBOC started the process of raising short-term money market rates on August 24, 2016. After a long period of stability in its regular open market operations (OMO), the central bank suddenly introduced 14-day reverse repurchase operations (reverse repos) at 2.4 percent rather than the more traditional seven-day funding at a fixed rate of 2.25 percent. The effect of this move was to introduce uncertainty about the PBOC’s intentions and to boost short-term overnight repo market rates, which edged higher into the 2.1–2.2 percent range. Rather than an outright hike in interest rates, the PBOC’s move raised the average weighted funding costs in the money market. But the market noticed the PBOC’s change in behavior right away and became far more sensitive to future tightening signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PBOC then engaged in a more persuasive policy operation by instructing banks to reduce their borrowing overnight and encouraging them to borrow at longer terms, which would have the effect of raising overall funding costs for banks and NBFIs. At the same time, to reinforce the effect of the policy guidance, the central bank offered larger volumes of longer-duration funding via its medium-term lending facility (MLF), which typically offered funding for a full year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These steps advanced incrementally, but they had clear effects on China’s money markets. Overnight rates rose from the 2.0–2.1 percent range in July and August 2016 to 2.4–2.7 percent by December 2016, with occasional spikes even higher. All of this occurred before the PBOC had formally adjusted the interest rates it offered to the market for short-term financing, which are more commonly viewed as the relevant policy interest rates for the central bank. The central bank’s first formal hike in these OMO interest rates did not occur until February 2017 and eventually produced four separate hikes totaling 30 basis points, with the last of the cycle occurring in April 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise in short-term money market rates and the sudden injection of policy volatility basically had the desired effect, which was to reduce the attractiveness of short-term borrowing in order to take leveraged positions into longer-term assets. With weaker demand for bonds, yields rose and bond issuance declined. Overall credit growth had not yet started to slow, but the shadow banking components of credit growth were starting to decelerate and unwind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even though the direction of the policy adjustment was intended, the PBOC struggled to control its magnitude, as the monetary tightening campaign produced some significant shocks in the interbank market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2016, a small securities company called Sealand Securities indicated it might refuse to honor some esoteric forms of entrusted bond contracts, in which securities companies would temporarily warehouse bonds for banks or other third parties. The bonds involved were safer policy bank bonds, but the concern that spread through the market was that other NBFIs might walk away from similar deals. As a result, banks stopped lending to NBFIs in the same volumes, and there was quickly a liquidity squeeze in the market, given that NBFIs were the primary borrowers throughout China’s interbank market. In order to calm the squeeze, the PBOC even needed to extend trading hours on some days in order to prevent defaults on interbank payments, which had touched off the June 2013 crisis. Then, regulators, led by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), needed to gather the creditors of the firm into a meeting over the weekend in order to manage the resulting fallout and prevent further contagion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More generally, the Sealand Securities scandal exposed an uncomfortable reality for the PBOC and its deleveraging effort: the potential for overstepping and triggering unintended consequences was readily apparent. The market contagion from credit risk among even very small institutions caused a significant sell-off in China’s fixed-income markets and forced regulators to directly intervene, refusing to allow Sealand to back away from the contracts. Even as the PBOC was trying to break the pattern, market stability in China depended upon widespread implicit guarantees. Any deviation from that pattern led to immediate shocks and market instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ItZWg5u.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were other limits to the PBOC’s monetary tightening efforts as well. For every action trying to contain the growth of China’s shadow banking system, there is seemingly an equal and opposite reaction by banks trying to maintain funding channels and expand their balance sheets. By limiting short-term borrowing via overnight repo markets, negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) issued in the interbank market quickly grew to become an alternative funding source for banks, particularly for joint stock and city commercial banks. This caused short-term interbank funding rates for banks to rise, which in turn passed higher interest rates on to borrowers in the real economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, NCD funding was riskier than funding from the interbank market because banks could simply issue the NCDs without any collateral. Because banks were presumed to be state-owned and guaranteed, this was an unlimited new higher-interest financing channel. In addition, the NCDs created new pressure to roll over the instruments, just as WMPs had created. Banks had to increasingly issue short-term NCDs at higher and higher costs. Ironically, without new regulations on this practice, the PBOC’s monetary tightening campaign was likely to create new financial risks without meaningfully limiting banks’ funding costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were other limits to the PBOC’s monetary tightening efforts as well. In trying to encourage NBFIs to reduce speculative assets, the PBOC was attempting to deny these institutions short-term funding. But the counterintuitive effect of such a liquidity squeeze was to force NBFIs to immediately sell any assets they could to raise money. Often, these were not risky but safer assets, including government bonds and policy bank bonds. After all, these assets were by far the most liquid in the market, making them an easy choice for traders to sell. But sales of these government and policy bank bonds forced issuers’ yields higher. Policy banks such as the China Development Bank and the Agricultural Development Bank of China depended upon the bond market for funding. But their business was largely making low-cost loans to local governments and SOEs. After a sell-off in the bond market in late October and early November 2017, policy banks could barely sell any bonds at yields below 5 percent, which made it difficult for policy banks to operate, given that most of their loans were made with yields around 4 percent. As a result of the deleveraging campaign, policy bank bond issuance dropped by over 30 percent in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the PBOC’s best efforts, monetary tightening was creating new problems of its own by the end of 2017. Short-term funding rates were higher and shadow banks were under pressure, but overall credit growth had barely slowed. Banks were finding alternative mechanisms to circumvent the effects of the PBOC’s controls on short-term financing. Property sales, prices, and new construction were still booming. Brokerages and fund assets were under pressure, but banks were able to shift some of the channel business to trust firms instead of these lines of credit completely disappearing. Overall financial risks were still rising, arguably, as banks and NBFIs were incentivized to take risks in more speculative lending. Monetary policy tightening was necessary but ultimately insufficient to squeeze shadow banks. Beijing needed to tighten the regulatory noose on banks and nonbank institutions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regulatory-tightening&quot;&gt;Regulatory Tightening&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulatory measures that Beijing introduced from 2017 to 2018 constituted the most significant changes in policy toward China’s shadow banking sector. Beijing was aware that previous regulations had been only a patchwork approach, and a more integrated effort to address banks’ reliance upon WMPs and other non-deposit liabilities was necessary. The overall focus of these regulatory efforts was to illuminate and highlight the risks in the system by forcing off-balance-sheet funding and loans back onto banks’ formal balance sheets. The other key focus was to break the assumption of implicit guarantees behind banks’ issuance of WMPs. For the shadow banking system to be controlled, investors and depositors needed to understand that they could face losses, even on products that banks were issuing. Beijing was trying to address the moral hazard at the heart of the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Macroprudential Framework Enforced by the PBOC:&lt;/strong&gt; The PBOC, CBRC, CSRC, and other institutions introduced several new regulations and circulars throughout the most intense periods of the deleveraging campaign. One of the more significant early steps was the introduction of a new macroprudential assessment framework by the PBOC. The central bank would review critical indicators of banks’ assets and liabilities on a quarterly basis and would assign an A, B, or C classification to the bank, which potentially influenced its access to central bank liquidity facilities or its regulatory treatment. In December 2016, the PBOC decided to include banks’ reliance on WMPs in the quarterly macroprudential assessment, which placed banks on notice that more regulations targeting non-deposit liabilities were likely to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asset Management Rules Targeting WMPs and Off-Balance-Sheet Assets:&lt;/strong&gt; The most significant regulatory changes that China introduced during the deleveraging campaign concerned rules governing almost all investment and funding products, on both the liability and asset sides of banks’ balance sheets. These were more comprehensive in scope and covered almost all financial institutions, banks, trusts, brokerages, and funds in order to avoid the regulatory whack-a-mole problem. These were informally called the “asset management rules,” and the first draft of these regulations was issued in February 2017. A further draft was refined in November 2017, and the final version was released in late April 2018. The rules had relaxed somewhat over the drafting process, primarily by allowing banks a longer grace period to change the structure of their asset bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core of the new asset management rules was designed to curb shadow banking growth and limit banks’ “channel” business, placing funds with third-party asset managers and NBFIs. The new rules banned any implicit or explicit guarantees on WMPs or asset management products, which had been the foundation of the rapid growth in shadow banking channels from 2012 to 2016. Asset management products were not permitted to invest, directly or indirectly, via either debt or equity into industries or sectors that were targeted by government regulations and explicit credit restrictions, such as lending to property developers and local government funding vehicles (LGFVs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the rules challenged banks’ existing procedures by permitting only one level of intermediation within asset management products, making it more difficult for banks to bypass various regulatory controls. For example, banks seldom invested directly in trust products. They would invest in asset management products issued by brokerages first and then use these funds to invest in trust products, avoiding a 10 percent risk capital requirement. This type of cooperation was very common among asset management products and NBFIs but would not be allowed under the new rules, which also disallowed funding these types of assets from “pooled” financing by banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the new asset management rules required that WMP investments be marked to market for investors to see both profits and losses. This meant that if WMPs started generating losses, investors would know how their investments would be marked down. Most retail and institutional investors bought WMPs on the assumption they were as safe as deposits while offering higher returns, and official losses were likely to frighten many current and potential investors. The logic of the new rules was that banks would face problems rolling over WMPs in driving overall balance sheet growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marking WMPs to market was a hugely disruptive event within the financial system, and banks strongly resisted the implementation of these rules. Some sought a caveat, in which cash-type WMPs that invested in short-term money market instruments and nothing longer than a year in maturity could still be sold to investors on a cost basis instead of marking the products to market. Naturally, banks attempted to classify more of their WMPs as “cash-type” to avoid the new regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1SIQevD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 3.1: List of Major Regulatory Policies, 2017–2018.&lt;/strong&gt; Sources: Government websites and media reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liquidity Management Guidelines to Discourage Short-Term Borrowing:&lt;/strong&gt; The other major regulatory rules the CBRC introduced in December 2017 concerned banks’ management of liquidity, which involved guidance of their liabilities’ structures and their assets. Generally, the idea of these new liquidity management rules was to force banks to borrow using longer-term, higher-cost funding and to shrink the duration of their assets so as to reduce the potential liquidity mismatch or any financial problems that would result from failing to roll over short-term funding instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2018, the CBRC introduced new rules to limit the use of wholesale short-term funding to invest in longer-term assets. This was in the form of a new guideline labeled the liquidity matching ratio (LMR). Anything banks borrowed that was shorter than three months in maturity from the interbank market — most importantly including NCDs — received a zero value within the calculation of the LMR, which discouraged banks from selling one-month NCDs and encouraged longer-term (3–6 months) NCD issuance. The LMR discouraged banks from engaging in interbank and shadow banking business in favor of traditional deposit and loan business. If a bank did absolutely nothing but accept deposits and make loans, it would easily meet the LMR threshold. However, most interbank businesses and other investments (shadow banking activities) had higher weights in the denominator, increasing the difficulty of achieving the required ratios for banks heavily involved in off-balance-sheet lending. The net effect of the new ratios was to reduce banks’ reliance upon short-term funding in the form of NCDs or WMPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Regulations Limiting the Use of NCDs to Circumvent WMP Regulations:&lt;/strong&gt; NCDs were targeted specifically as well. While in the past NCDs were technically classified not as interbank liabilities but as “bonds payable,” regulators closed that loophole in August 2017. At that point, banks were then subject to a preexisting limit that interbank liabilities could only be one-third of banks’ total liabilities. The regulation then effectively cut off one of banks’ most important marginal sources of funding growth and left them with a choice to either raise additional deposits or allow their balance sheets to shrink as these short-term funding instruments rolled off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulations to Force Loans Back onto Banks’ Balance Sheets:&lt;/strong&gt; On the asset side of the balance sheet, regulators encouraged banks to migrate their off-balance-sheet assets back onto the formal balance sheet in the form of loans. To a certain extent, this process was automatic, as the inability to roll over a short-term funding instrument meant that a shadow lender or NBFI was suddenly short of funding; therefore, a claim on the NBFI ended up as a claim on the underlying borrower. The exact scale of the targeted reduction in off-balance-sheet assets remained undeclared. Most reports claimed there was informal guidance targeting around a one-third reduction in shadow banking activity by the end of 2020, or around 8 trillion yuan ($1.2 trillion) in assets moving back to formal balance sheets. Banks’ claims on NBFIs would need to shrink by 2–3 trillion yuan per year to meet that target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limits on “Cash Pooling” within WMPs:&lt;/strong&gt; A December 2018 decision placed further restrictions on how WMPs could operate. The CBRC issued a new circular that required banks to run their WMP business in a separate entity from the bank itself so that cash pooling from WMPs could not be used to fund assets within banks’ formal loan books. Clarifying that banks’ WMPs were separate subsidiaries was also designed to limit the potential risk to the banks’ own liquidity in the case that WMP funding dried up quickly, as in the June 2013 interbank market crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulations on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending Networks:&lt;/strong&gt; Beijing also experimented with various regulations on P2P lenders in 2016 and 2017. P2P private lenders were often among the riskiest forms of shadow financing, and they evolved quickly to provide short-term loans to small businesses as well as down payments for mortgages for lower-income households. Regulations introduced in 2016 prohibited these products from pooling funds, holding deposits, or providing guaranteed returns to customers. The rules also limited individual and corporate loan levels per platform in an effort to squeeze the scope of these businesses. Additional regulations forced these platforms to register officially with authorities and obtain online lending licenses. These platforms started to weaken significantly in 2017 and 2018, and many collapses and defaults generated protests from dissatisfied investors, including a significant protest of thousands of people in Beijing in August 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explicit Targets for SOEs to Cut Leverage Ratios:&lt;/strong&gt; New regulations on SOEs were imposed as well, with explicit targets on leverage ratios for some types of state firms. In September 2018, the CCP’s Central Committee and the State Council issued a joint circular, officially publicizing a deleveraging target for the first time, requiring all SOEs to cut leverage by 2 percentage points from 2017 levels by the end of 2020. SOEs were encouraged to engage in debt-to-equity swaps in order to reduce their aggregate debt burden. The PBOC also included specific funding allocated for such debt-to-equity swaps, often when cutting banks’ required reserve ratios. Ultimately, banks were reluctant to engage in these debt-to-equity swaps with SOEs, and actual implementation was very limited. State firms then attempted to meet the regulatory requirements by issuing perpetual bonds, which would not be included in official debt calculations since they are typically classified as equity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flurry of regulatory tightening conditions had a meaningful impact on banks’ engagement with NBFIs. Rather than a whack-a-mole approach to looking at individual forms of lending, the regulatory tightening steps targeted the funding side of banks’ balance sheets and the WMPs and NCDs that had sustained shadow banking activity. As the next chapter discusses, overall shadow banking assets started declining in 2017, and China saw the slowest pace of overall credit growth in recent history in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the success of regulatory tightening allowed Beijing to take the pressure off the banking system via monetary policy and actually ease monetary conditions starting in 2018. With more confidence that the regulatory structure to control shadow banking activity had been strengthened, Beijing was able to reduce interest rates to manage potential financial stress. Monetary tightening was a necessary condition for deleveraging to succeed, but regulatory tightening became the primary tool to achieve deleveraging after monetary tightening produced unintended consequences. In a highly indebted economy and a risky financial system, continued monetary tightening would have likely generated significant new financial risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reorganization-of-government-bureaucracies&quot;&gt;Reorganization of Government Bureaucracies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant elements of the deleveraging campaign was the reorganization of China’s regulatory structure governing the financial system. The creation of a “super regulator” had been a subject of discussion in China for several years. In 2013 the State Council, at the request of the PBOC, agreed to establish an inter-ministerial joint meeting for financial regulation and coordination. This was an organization with no real power, but it became useful for communication purposes across financial bureaucracies. One of the main reasons such coordination is necessary is the development of financial institutions with mixed operations — those that operate as commercial banks, asset managers, and insurance providers. The three individual regulators were divided in their supervision of such institutions, enabling them to take on far greater risks than any one regulatory agency would permit. A super regulator would unify those bureaucratic responsibilities while avoiding the problem of banks and NBFIs restructuring assets or liabilities to avoid regulatory oversight by an individual agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NFWC that took place in July 2017 created the leadership consensus around a new regulatory agency, which ended up becoming the Financial Stability and Development Committee (FSDC) under the State Council, created in November 2017. The agency was a financial coordination commission above the PBOC and the other three financial regulatory institutions — the CBRC, CSRC, and CIRC. In the end, Liu He led the committee, with the central bank managing daily operations. The other key change resulting from this reorganization was the merger of the operations of the CIRC and CBRC into a new China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next year, the FSDC was the primary institution rolling out new regulations consistent with the deleveraging campaign’s objectives. The establishment of the committee corresponded with the most aggressive period of regulatory tightening, with Beijing’s resources concentrated to avoid the potential for regulatory arbitrage. Most significantly, the deleveraging campaign was important enough for China to contemplate a wholesale reorganization of its bureaucratic structure for financial regulation. In turn, that bureaucratic reorganization was necessary for the broader deleveraging effort to gain momentum and for an effective transition from monetary to regulatory tightening efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;controls-on-local-government-debt-and-investment&quot;&gt;Controls on Local Government Debt and Investment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to regulatory controls on banks and NBFIs, Chinese authorities intensified their focus on local governments themselves since localities had been key drivers of credit demand for many years, both via direct borrowing and indirectly via LGFVs and related companies. Local government debt had been in focus for Chinese regulators for years, with a 12.2 trillion yuan ($1.8 trillion) “swap bond” program launched from 2015 to 2018, designed to replace higher-interest debt from shadow banks with low-interest debt from local government bonds. After the swap bond program, local governments were intended to only be able to borrow money by selling bonds. In addition, the swap bonds were supposed to retire all of their hidden obligations, making them more transparent in the form of bond debt. But in reality, local governments underreported the actual size of their borrowing from shadow banks and were still servicing large quantities of debt after the swap. Even worse, their debt continued expanding after the restructuring effort, not only through shadow banking channels but also through more direct borrowing from banks by local SOEs, LGFVs, and other local public institutions such as universities and hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By early 2018, Chinese authorities placed these more expansive categories of debt under the regulatory microscope and implemented measures to reduce implicit debts incurred by local governments. There were several circulars released by local Ministry of Finance offices attempting to force localities to disclose total levels of implicit debt, with the idea of eventually controlling it. The debt totals would include debt incurred by local governments, financing platforms (LGFVs), SOEs, and public institutions in nonbond forms of borrowing used to fund public welfare projects. Implicit debt generally included any form of borrowing that would eventually require fiscal funds to repay the debt. The specified forms of financing in the circulars included bank loans, trust loans, commercial leasing, corporate bonds, public-private partnerships, procurement, equity financing, government-guided funds, and private equity. These circulars claimed that the objective was to repay all local government implicit debt within three to five years. Naturally, reducing these forms of borrowing would also slow economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing had always maintained an ambiguous relationship regarding central government support for local government fiscal obligations. While Beijing’s guarantees were often necessary in order to sell local government bonds at auction, the Ministry of Finance usually tried to argue that local government debt in general was to be managed at the provincial level or below, and Beijing had no intention of providing support. At the same time, the local debt situation had become so unsustainably large that there was no plausible path out of the debt problem other than Beijing providing direct support and incurring significant fiscal costs. In trying to encourage local governments to digest and reduce implicit debt, Beijing tried to eventually reduce its own fiscal obligations but with the acknowledged consequence that this was likely to slow the economy as well. But placing additional pressure on local governments to reduce their own borrowing was essential for the broader deleveraging campaign to succeed, reinforcing the effects of monetary and regulatory tightening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;moral-hazard-and-root-causes&quot;&gt;Moral Hazard and Root Causes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign China launched in 2016 involved several tools and incremental steps — from monetary tightening efforts to tighter regulations on shadow banking to the reorganization of government bureaucracies and controls on local government implicit debt. Over time, these measures not only reduced credit and debt growth but also offered a far more stable policy environment involving less competition among China’s financial regulators. While credit became scarce in the short term, as discussed in the next chapter, squeezing shadow financing would also have the salutary effect of reducing funding costs for some Chinese corporations over the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monetary and regulatory tightening are effective tools to control leverage growth temporarily, but they cannot eliminate the root cause of leverage in China: widespread moral hazard and implicit no-default guarantees. These guarantees allow banks, companies, and local governments to borrow recklessly, and as long as implicit guarantees exist, leverage will bounce back once monetary policy is eased and regulators loosen their controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after the regulatory tightening campaign intensified, other forms of financing began slipping through the cracks, given the profound political incentives to continue borrowing and rolling over existing debt to fund new property construction and local government projects. Asset-backed securities became an alternative mechanism for property developers to borrow, first at small volumes and then ramping up in 2017 and 2018. Rather than competing based on WMP interest rates, banks started to offer structured deposits, which were designed essentially to offer higher interest rates to depositors based on obscure investment bets, making them similar to WMPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit growth slowed significantly in 2018, with corporations the primary victims. But households actually expanded their overall borrowing. Because there were fewer alternative channels to lend to higher-interest borrowers via shadow banks and NBFIs, banks searched for the highest-interest lending opportunities available, which were mortgage loans to home buyers and credit card debt to consumers. In combination with the shantytown redevelopment program, this ended up driving another wave of speculation in the housing and land markets, even while overall credit growth remained under pressure. The property market’s resistance to deleveraging further fueled the bubble in the years ahead, as discussed in subsequent chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, regulatory tightening did not stop in 2018. The deleveraging campaign extended further, even after the economy had weakened and even following the outbreak of Covid-19 in early 2020. Because speculation in the property market had continued, in late August 2020, China introduced its most significant regulatory tightening step, the “three red lines,” explicitly limiting the borrowing of property developers according to specified financial ratios. This step was widely linked to the property market’s dramatic downturn starting in 2021 as developers cut off from financing were forced to scale back on new land purchases and place more inventory on an already crowded market. In 2021, the newly inaugurated CBIRC initiated new controls on borrowing by trust companies after trusts had avoided some of the harshest regulatory measures on NBFIs. The new limits targeted a 1 trillion yuan ($147 billion) reduction in trust loans over the full year, which ended up weakening the sector and LGFVs’ access to credit. Late in 2021, authorities also unveiled new controls over cash-type WMPs to reduce the types of assets and increase the quality of the assets banks could place within these instruments, which were designed to bypass the requirements to mark WMP investments to market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s deleveraging campaign hit shadow banks with multiple blows, and even after the most intense periods of the campaign in 2017 and 2018, additional incremental steps were rolled out in the following years. But the most effective step within the deleveraging effort was to precipitate defaults within China’s financial system, forcing financial institutions to start to price credit risk more effectively. Eliminating the widespread guarantees within China’s financial system was a necessary element for reducing overall systemic risks in China. But this step itself was dangerous, as investors who noticed guarantees breaking down in one asset market, such as P2P lenders or state-owned corporate bonds, would naturally wonder whether those guarantees might change elsewhere, thus causing investors to protect themselves, reduce risks, and sell assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s war against shadow banks was a complicated balancing act, reducing credit and allowing defaults to teach investors more accurate risk perceptions but without triggering systemic risks. These were Beijing’s intentions, but the actual effects of the deleveraging effort on the economy and financial system are explored in more detail in the following chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deleveraging-and-chinas-financial-system&quot;&gt;Deleveraging and China’s Financial System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 3 described the mechanics of China’s deleveraging campaign and the individual actions that Beijing initiated in its efforts to shrink the shadow banking system. Monetary tightening progressed to regulatory tightening and a reorganization of government bureaucracies, accompanied by a broader effort to control local government debts. But China had often attempted to impose new limits on informal banking, and even a coordinated campaign such as that launched in 2016 was no guarantee of success in achieving Beijing’s objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter evaluates the results of Beijing’s efforts to control shadow banks, primarily based on the actions taken from 2016 to 2018, using data from banks themselves, as well as aggregate data from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), and other sources covering nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs). Financial results from 42 banks are reported here, covering around 66 percent of the total assets of China’s banking system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary effects of the deleveraging campaign on China’s financial system can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall credit and debt growth slowed significantly, with an outright contraction of credit within the shadow banking system.&lt;/strong&gt; The campaign was generally successful in its primary objective, which was to reduce the size of the shadow banking system, particularly in terms of the volume of credit flowing through these less regulated channels. The shadow banks and NBFIs were large enough to have an impact on the overall pace of credit and debt growth in China’s economy, which slowed considerably in late 2017 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-deposit liabilities, such as wealth management products (WMPs) and other interbank liabilities, contracted and were replaced with more stable deposits.&lt;/strong&gt; Monetary tightening reduced leveraged positions in speculative markets, while regulatory efforts to mark WMPs’ investments to market value reduced the aggregate volume of interbank financing, forcing banks to attract deposits on their balance sheets. Regulatory pressure on negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) reduced the proportion of these instruments within overall bank funding structures. Initially, the household sector replaced some WMPs with structured deposits and, after a subsequent regulatory crackdown, shifted funds into safer time deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loans migrated back to the formal balance sheets of banks, replacing investment receivables and other types of credit assets.&lt;/strong&gt; The changing funding climate and the regulatory pressure on the channel business from banks to NBFIs caused a sharp reduction in these assets on banks’ balance sheets. The liquidity matching ratio (LMR) requirement and other regulatory measures encouraged banks to account for off-balance-sheet assets as loans. As a result, loans rose as a proportion of total assets within the banking system. Banks faced heavier pressure to boost capital levels to accommodate the rising level and proportion of bank loans on their balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The distribution of credit across provinces shifted, with the slowdown in credit concentrated in the northeastern and western provinces.&lt;/strong&gt; Many provincial governments had relied upon shadow banking channels to expand overall investment, and those provinces were hit hardest by the sector’s contraction. Coastal and southeastern provinces generally maintained their access to credit despite the deleveraging campaign, which also indicates the importance of the property market within those regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defaults and credit risk within informal financial institutions became far more common.&lt;/strong&gt; Starting with peer-to-peer (P2P) lending networks, which defaulted in large numbers in 2017 and 2018, the deleveraging campaign cut off many types of borrowers from credit, which resulted in difficulties in refinancing. Small banks began to default in 2019, and corporate bonds defaulted in much larger numbers by 2020. Property developers and trust companies started defaulting in larger volumes in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;an-overall-slowdown-in-credit-and-debt-growth&quot;&gt;An Overall Slowdown in Credit and Debt Growth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign’s primary impact on the financial system was to slow the rapid extension of credit and accumulation of debt that had marked the previous eight years since China’s 4 trillion yuan ($588 billion) stimulus package launched in late 2008. The overall pace of credit growth from 2009 to 2016, measured via bank asset growth, averaged 17.5 percent. In 2017, asset growth nosedived to 8.4 percent. By the end of 2018, it had hit an all-time low of 6.8 percent. While headline GDP growth was probably overstated for several years between 2014 and 2018, official real GDP growth averaged 7.0 percent over that five-year period. As a result, the deleveraging campaign formally lived up to its name, with aggregate leverage — credit and debt as a proportion of GDP — falling for one of the first times in China’s recent history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank assets are a reasonable but imperfect measure of overall credit growth in China’s economy. China technically publishes multiple statistics measuring total credit. These include the total volume of formal bank loans, as well as a broader classification called “aggregate financing to the real economy,” which most observers label total social financing (TSF). This is a very loose translation for the Chinese term, which generally refers to society-wide financing. Both bank assets and TSF include some measures of shadow banking activity, but these are distinct. Bank assets are a slightly more expansive measure of shadow banking and overall credit growth. TSF statistics include categories for undiscounted bankers’ acceptances, loans from trust companies, and entrusted loans, which are corporate-to-corporate loans. Undiscounted bankers’ acceptances are usually correlated with shadow banking activity, but the statistic is not a direct measure of shadow lending, as it can also reflect short-term changes in interest rates or temporary liquidity crunches within the banking system. Trust loans and entrusted loans are generally considered to represent shadow banking loans, but they are only limited categories of these loans. The trust loans statistic within PBOC TSF data is generally thought to be smaller than the overall volume of trust loans extended in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank assets data released by the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) and the PBOC under the Balance Sheet of Other Depository Corporations are slightly more expansive in covering different categories of credit than the PBOC’s TSF measure. Bank assets include categories for banks’ claims on other banks, which were often used to hide shadow banking assets as collateral until the practice was regulated more stringently in 2014. The data series also includes banks’ claims on other financial institutions, which can include NBFIs. This series included many of the different asset forms that banks used to circumvent regulatory controls, including trust beneficiary rights, directional asset management plans, and investment receivables. As this asset transformation was a key part of the expansion of shadow banking from 2014 to 2016, a measure that incorporates these claims is slightly more accurate, if still incomplete. When asset growth started slowing in late 2017 and 2018, bank assets showed a sharper decline than TSF, largely because TSF did not capture as large a proportion of informal financing activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the slowdown in credit growth occurred in the informal banking channels and lending to China’s corporate sector. Within banks’ assets, these loans were particularly concentrated in banks’ claims on third-party financial institutions and NBFIs, which were central to shadow banking activity. Banks’ claims on other banks, combined with their claims on NBFIs, shifted from an annual expansion of 9.9 trillion yuan ($1.5 trillion) in 2015 and 9.0 trillion yuan ($1.3 trillion) in 2016 to an outright annual contraction of 451 billion yuan in 2017 and a whopping 3.1 trillion yuan ($449 billion) in 2018. This was the primary reason that overall new bank asset growth slowed from 31.2 trillion yuan ($4.6 trillion) in 2016 to only 19.3 trillion yuan ($2.8 trillion) in 2017 and 17.0 trillion yuan ($2.5 trillion) in 2018. A combined measure of lending to corporations, in addition to corporate bond issuance and shadow banking claims, rose by only 4 percent by early 2018, the lowest rate of growth in history. This same measure had surged by an average of 18.3 percent from 2012 to 2016. As the charts show, these were significant changes in overall credit growth and lending activity across China’s economy. Basically, corporate credit growth was cut by more than half, and many borrowers found themselves suddenly cut off from financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 4.2 shows the changes in the composition of banks’ total assets over time. As the deleveraging campaign intensified, some of the channels for shadow banking activity — banks’ claims on NBFIs and claims on other banks — shrank considerably, while loan assets increased. Informal banking activity went from being the most important marginal driver of credit growth within the system in 2015–16 to the most significant drag on asset growth by 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KXVCF5r.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;contraction-in-non-deposit-liabilities-and-wmps&quot;&gt;Contraction in Non-deposit Liabilities and WMPs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall credit growth slowed considerably in 2017 and 2018, in part because funding for shadow banking assets had dried up as short-term money market rates rose and became more volatile. Regulatory pressure on WMPs was generally successful in reducing banks’ issuance of these products, which meant that many financial institutions were forced to rely upon more traditional deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shadow banking expanded from 2012 to 2016, banks saw a steady decline in their reliance upon deposits as a proportion of overall funding (Figure 4.3). This ratio fell sharply from 79.6 percent in 2012 to 71.4 percent in 2017 (with 250 trillion yuan [$36.8 trillion] in banking system liabilities at the end of 2017, each percentage point represented a 2.5 trillion yuan [$370 billion] decline in deposits). But as informal financing channels and reliance upon interbank funding shrank, deposits became more important within banks’ overall funding, and the ratio rose quickly in 2018, ascending to 74.6 percent in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/igct8i7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.3: Growth of Deposits and Proportion of Overall Bank Liabilities, 2012–2021.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Banks’ annual reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, monetary tightening steps and higher interest rates dramatically reduced the growth and importance of interbank financing in China’s money markets. The proportion of interbank liabilities relative to total bank liabilities among surveyed banks remained stable following the introduction of the deleveraging campaign, dropping from a peak of 21.5 percent in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interbank deposits from other banks, which had been used to allow smaller banks to compete for funding at higher rates, dropped sharply, from 19.2 trillion yuan ($2.8 trillion) in 2016 to 16.1 trillion yuan ($2.4 trillion) in 2018. For a while, this financing was replaced by interbank NCDs, which show up in Figure 4.4 as interbank bonds. But the net result of the deleveraging campaign was to freeze interbank financing as a marginal driver of new shadow banking growth within China’s financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qynR4fD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.4: Contributors to Interbank Funding in China’s Banks, 2012–2021.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Banks’ annual reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, regulatory tightening measures and requirements that WMP investments be marked to market value caused banks to dramatically scale back issuance of new WMPs. The balance of WMPs contracted outright from 23.1 trillion yuan ($3.4 trillion) in 2016 to 22.0 trillion yuan ($3.2 trillion) by 2018 (Figure 4.5). Basically, this meant existing WMP funding was being rolled over, but these instruments were not being used as a marginal source of new funding within the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, in 2020 and 2021, WMP issuance rebounded again as interbank interest rates declined. But these were primarily cash-type WMPs restricted in the types of assets in which they could invest and still subject to controls under the new asset management rules introduced in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HbWMOot.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned previously, many banks attempted to bypass regulatory guidance on WMPs by introducing higher-interest deposits labeled as “structured deposits.” These were often used as vehicles for arbitrage, in which low-cost borrowing from the money markets when rates were low could be redeposited into other banks’ structured deposits at a profit. As the deleveraging effort continued in 2020 and 2021, regulatory scrutiny of structured deposits increased. As a result, many investors had no choice but to shift savings back into more traditional long-term time deposits, which had seen no significant reduction in interest rates since the deleveraging campaign launched (Figure 4.6). With banks reducing issuance of WMPs and more WMPs bearing losses in investments that investors could see transparently, time deposits became the much safer alternative. As a result, banks started relying upon deposits for a far greater proportion of overall funding starting in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall trend from 2016 to 2019, the most intense period of China’s deleveraging campaign, was to reduce reliance upon non-deposit sources of funding such as WMPs. Banks’ liabilities became much clearer to regulators and investors and shifted back toward more traditional deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shadow-banking-assets-migrate-back-to-loans&quot;&gt;Shadow Banking Assets Migrate Back to Loans&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the asset side of banks’ balance sheets, the effect of the deleveraging campaign was similar. With shadow funding instruments contracting, banks needed to move loans back to formal balance sheets. This caused banks to fully account for these loans within capital risk weightings and contributed to slower asset growth as well. As a result, formal bank loans rose consistently as a proportion of surveyed banks’ overall assets, from 46.3 percent in 2016 to 55.4 percent in 2021 (Figure 4.7). Once again, the deleveraging campaign’s start in 2016 was the critical inflection point in banks’ management of their balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AODsmzv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.7: Total Loans and Proportion of Total Bank Assets, 2012–2021.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Banks’ annual reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks used several different classifications of assets for their channel business in raising funds from depositors and placing them with NBFIs and other shadow banks or asset managers. Some of these included trust beneficiary rights, in which the bank did not keep the loan on its balance sheet, only a beneficiary right to the interest income. Others included investment receivables and directional asset management plans, in which loans were reclassified as investments or asset management plans. As Figure 4.8 shows, these assets skyrocketed in popularity from 2012 to 2016, rising from 4.8 percent to 18.3 percent of total bank assets. However, the deleveraging campaign dramatically affected the attractiveness of these assets, and they subsequently dropped to 12.2 percent of total assets in only two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the accounting treatment of these assets changed under a new accounting standard labeled International Financial Reporting Standard 9, banks stopped reporting these assets as investment receivables, as they would have needed to account for additional credit losses within these instruments, which explains why the data series stops in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EDK6BNg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.8: Total Investment Receivables and Proportion of Total Assets, 2012–2018.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Banks’ annual reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the PBOC’s official data, these non-loan assets or other forms of shadow credit were often counted within a category labeled “shares and other investments” for banks, as a category for uses of banks’ funds, similar to loans (Figure 4.9). This more comprehensive monthly data series clearly shows the rapid rise of shadow banking channels from 2011 to 2016, when the category of shares and other investments rose by an astonishing 20.8 trillion yuan (around $3.0 trillion at 2016 exchange rates) and represented a peak of 12.9 percent of the total uses of funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outright peak in this series indicating shadow banking activity was reached in February 2017, after the deleveraging campaign had started. By 2021, these were around half of the peak proportion of banks’ uses of funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also data series available from NBFIs, who were often the final lenders or the agents within the shadow banking system. A combination of data sources from the industry associations linked to these institutions can create a reasonable proxy for the total assets of NBFIs on an annual basis, even if this is likely conservative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/k5hDJBs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total NBFI assets skyrocketed between 2013 and 2016, rising by an estimated 51 trillion yuan ($7.3 trillion). This is roughly in line with previous estimates of total informal financing growth within formal banks’ asset books of 36.7 trillion yuan ($5.4 trillion) from 2012 to 2016. Most significantly, these assets contracted meaningfully in 2017 and 2018, led by the trust sector, which often lent to property developers and local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) (Figure 4.10).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kjhpdrC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulatory tightening campaign also drove banks and asset managers to change how they allocated funds raised within WMPs. Data from Chinawealth.com.cn, the government website for WMP products, show how WMP assets changed over the course of the deleveraging effort (Figure 4.11). The total proportion of nonstandard credit assets, or those usually associated with shadow banking loans, fell from 27.5 percent in 2013 to only 8.4 percent in 2021. Similarly, the proportion of safer assets, including bonds, continued rising, finally reaching 68.4 percent of WMP assets in 2021. The levels of cash and bank deposits also include interbank bank deposits and placements of funds with other banks, which were regulated more stringently starting in 2017. As a result, the proportion of these assets also declined under the deleveraging campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/X7tbUbL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the net effect of the deleveraging campaign was to clarify banks’ shadow banking exposures, moving more assets back to the formal loan book. Similarly, most measures of informal or shadow banking loans rose very quickly from 2012 to 2016 and, upon the introduction of the deleveraging campaign, began contracting in 2017 and 2018. The net effect was to shine a light on more, but not all, of banks’ riskier lending practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;differentiation-in-credit-growth-across-provinces&quot;&gt;Differentiation in Credit Growth across Provinces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more important implications of the deleveraging campaign was the way it changed the geographic distribution of economic growth in China and accelerated differences in financial conditions across different provinces and regions. Because some provincial governments had relied upon LGFVs and shadow banking channels more heavily than others, when those channels contracted, some provinces posted considerable slowdowns in overall credit growth. This weakened local government investment within those localities and forced them to rely more heavily upon local government special revenue bonds (SRBs) for fiscal support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 4.12 shows how regional patterns of credit distribution changed considerably after the introduction of the deleveraging campaign. Before the campaign, from 2014 to 2018, credit growth in northeastern provinces (considered China’s rust belt) and western provinces actually outpaced overall credit growth and the loans extended in eastern and southeastern coastal provinces. By 2018, this pattern of credit distribution changed fundamentally. Since the end of 2018, credit growth across the northeastern and western provinces has averaged only 4 percent, compared to 13 percent in the coastal southeast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sKGnyQ2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.12: Estimated Credit Growth (TSF) across Regions in China, 2014–2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: PBOC; Rhodium Group calculations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of this differentiation can be explained by the shift toward mortgage lending within the financial system and the fact that property markets were more vibrant and prices higher in the southeastern coastal provinces, where the population was still growing. But overall, it shows a change in the financial system’s willingness to extend credit in riskier regions of the economy, where growth prospects were weaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the slowdown in credit in interior provinces demonstrates how the deleveraging campaign introduced new credit risks into China’s financial system, based on the perceived credit quality of the local government involved in guaranteeing or supporting different types of assets. This geographic counterparty risk became more important as more local government state-owned enterprises (SOEs) started to default, which effectively cut off entire provinces from financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defaults-rise-sharply-as-credit-risk-emerges&quot;&gt;Defaults Rise Sharply as Credit Risk Emerges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign also accelerated the introduction of credit risks and default risks into China’s financial system, even though this process was already underway. From 2012 to 2016, China’s shadow banking system expanded rapidly because many investors assumed that losses were almost impossible and that, if widespread financial distress became a possibility, Beijing would intervene and calm markets, minimizing losses. Investors and market participants did not need to limit their own risks before 2016 because they could count on the fact that Beijing was concerned about the political effects of financial instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign broke down the assumption of moral hazard within the financial system in two ways. First, by declaring war against shadow banking institutions, Beijing clearly indicated a changing set of political preferences in which shadow financing channels were considered riskier. This forced investors to contemplate the possibility that Beijing might not offer concrete support for the riskiest credit channels within the financial system, such as P2P lending networks and trust companies. Once that possibility of default emerged in certain asset classes, the leap to other assets potentially defaulting was much smaller. As a result, investors and markets needed to start considering which informal financial institutions bore credit risk, and they reduced investments accordingly. This helped to accelerate the contraction of the shadow banking sector in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, by reducing aggregate credit growth, particularly within shadow financing channels, the deleveraging campaign reduced the refinancing possibilities for many types of borrowers, who were suddenly cut off from credit. Even if Beijing had wanted to send alternative political signals that certain borrowers were safe, the reduction in credit growth would have generated additional defaults and credit risk. This was particularly common within China’s corporate bond market, where the first sharp rise in defaults took place in the second half of 2018, when overall credit growth declined sharply (Figure 4.13). Defaults on corporate bonds continued in later years and spread to new borrowers, including local government SOEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uLIgbSD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image20&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.13: Monthly Corporate Bond Defaults, Onshore Market, March 2014–December 2021.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Rhodium Group Corporate Bond Default Database.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the borrowers who were defaulting were typically from industries serviced by shadow banking institutions, including LGFVs and property developers (Figure 4.14). Defaults were concentrated in the capital goods and materials sectors, along with utilities, in 2018 and 2019. Then, defaults in the property sector became much more common in 2020 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LCbHE4X.png&quot; alt=&quot;image21&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This introduction of credit risk within China’s financial system set the stage for the end of China’s decade-long credit bubble. Once lenders needed to consider the possibility of default, fewer and fewer asset classes and industries were considered creditworthy. As those industries slowed along with the broader economy, credit demand dried up as well. One of the deleveraging campaign’s most significant impacts was the introduction of credit risk in several asset classes, which gradually broke down the widespread assumption of moral hazard and implicit government guarantees across China’s financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-changed-financial-system&quot;&gt;A Changed Financial System&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of three years, from 2016 to 2018, the deleveraging campaign redirected China’s financial system in several ways. Shadow banking channels contracted, which forced banks to search for more stable deposit funding. Loans that could no longer be funded by shadow banking institutions and banks’ channel business migrated back to the formal loan book. This had the effect of increasing transparency within China’s banking system and improved the overall stability of the funding base for banks. The contraction in shadow banking channels caused the overall pace of credit growth to slow significantly, by far more than Beijing had intended. In part this was because the actual size of the shadow banking system had been obscured from regulators’ view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the deleveraging campaign introduced new changes in the patterns of credit distribution within China. Certain localities in China’s northeastern and western provinces were hit much harder than others from the slowdown in credit growth, while coastal southeastern provinces retained their access to credit. Defaults became far more probable in riskier financial assets and started spreading to corporate bonds and SOEs as well. Smaller banks, such as Baoshang Bank and the Bank of Jinzhou, defaulted based on their exposure to riskier forms of lending concentrated within certain localities. Banks started to differentiate lending patterns across localities and across asset classes as credit risk became much more acute relative to a baseline in which almost all assets were assumed to be guaranteed and losses were improbable. This redirection of China’s financial system had meaningful effects on the real economy as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deleveraging-and-chinas-economy&quot;&gt;Deleveraging and China’s Economy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the deleveraging campaign’s impact on China’s financial system, the real economy was bound to feel its effects. Beijing’s bargain and hope was that deleveraging could simply “skim the froth” of the speculative activity within China’s financial markets without affecting borrowers in the broader economy. But cutting credit growth roughly in half meant that many borrowers suddenly found themselves cut off from financing and needing to scramble for alternative options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of the deleveraging campaign on China’s economy, starting around 2018 and continuing in the following years, can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic growth slowed by a larger margin than Beijing had anticipated.&lt;/strong&gt; The broader objective to limit financial risks without squeezing the real economy was generally unsuccessful. Shadow banks were funding real borrowers in China’s economy as well as financial speculation. While headline GDP growth barely moved during the deleveraging campaign, most indicators of industrial output contracted outright in the second half of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The property bubble reinflated because credit was reallocated to mortgage loans for households, which used credit to buy houses before they were constructed.&lt;/strong&gt; The deleveraging campaign encouraged banks to seek out borrowers willing to pay higher interest rates, which were primarily home buyers taking out mortgage loans. As property developers were forced to repay shadow banking debt, they often used preconstruction housing sales to do so, replacing borrowing from shadow banks with borrowing from leveraged home buyers. This transition explains the continued growth of China’s property bubble and developers’ financing shortfalls, which made them unable to complete houses sold in 2021 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s private sector was affected most by the decline in overall credit, reducing business investment.&lt;/strong&gt; Overall credit growth slowed significantly in 2017 and 2018, largely because of the slowdown in shadow banking channels. As loans to China’s corporate sector contracted, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) largely preserved their access to financing, while private sector firms were squeezed disproportionately, reducing the overall efficiency of investment in the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflation dropped meaningfully as corporate credit slowed, and low- and middle-income households lost access to financing from shadow banks, reducing consumer spending.&lt;/strong&gt; Ever since the deleveraging campaign started to impact shadow financing channels, China’s core consumer price inflation has remained below 1 percent, indicating the slowdown in consumer credit growth caused by the collapse of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending networks and other informal financial channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiscal strains within China’s local governments increased significantly, requiring more assistance from Beijing.&lt;/strong&gt; The pressure on local governments to repay implicit debt, along with the decline in the property market, significantly weakened localities’ capacity to repay their obligations. New fiscal tools such as local government special revenue bonds (SRBs) became necessary to maintain infrastructure investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-credit-induced-slowdown-in-output-and-investment&quot;&gt;A Credit-Induced Slowdown in Output and Investment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign caused overall credit growth to slow from 15.7 percent in 2015 and 2016 to only 8.4 percent in 2017 and 6.8 percent in 2018 (measured via bank assets). This basically meant that credit growth was cut in half in a very short timeframe. For corporate borrowers, the squeeze was even more extreme, as some new lending was also being redirected to China’s households. Many borrowers, unable to refinance, were forced to make difficult choices about reducing output and investment or financing investment out of profit or operating cash flows. Many state-owned corporations and local government financing vehicles (LGFVs), however, engaged in quasi-fiscal investments that had very weak operating cash flows and profitability. They depended on new credit to maintain activity. As a result, when credit growth slowed, the overall pace of output growth slowed as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the slowdown in output growth in 2018 was readily apparent in some Chinese data series but not others (Figure 5.1). Headline GDP growth is notoriously “smoothed” in China, and over the course of 2018, this measure barely slowed at all, from 6.9 percent growth in the first quarter to 6.5 percent growth in the fourth quarter. GDP growth rates in China over the four-year period from 2015 to 2018 were the smoothest of any major economy in at least 30–40 years (given data availability questions), never moving outside a range of 6.5–7.1 percent growth. Industrial value-added growth in China, an indicator of real output and an input into official GDP calculations, was only slightly more volatile, falling from 7.0 percent growth in April 2018 to 5.4 percent growth in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other subcomponents, however, pointed to a much more severe slump. Auto sales had shown a 16 percent decline by November and December. Output of major household durables and white goods such as refrigerators and washing machines started to contract in late 2018, along with other consumer goods. Property developers started to slow construction of houses they had already sold in order to retain cash, and house completions declined by 8 percent in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to look at a broader measure of industrial output, the Rhodium China Activity Tracker (R-CAT) takes a weighted average of unit-level monthly output of all 103 industrial output series released by the National Bureau of Statistics (Figure 5.2). The indicators are then seasonally adjusted and weighted based on proxies for their importance within the economy, using revenue of major enterprises and tax revenues. The net result showed that aggregate weighted industrial output had fallen by 6–7 percent year over year in the third quarter of 2018, with the most significant declines occurring in output of consumer goods. These were the largest declines in overall output until the Covid-19 pandemic hit in early 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3L6VnUf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other indicators of aggregate economic activity showed similar declines. An alternative measure used by the U.S. Federal Reserve in evaluating the effects of a changing credit impulse on China’s economy similarly showed a meaningful cyclical downturn in 2018. This was also consistent with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) ’s shift toward monetary easing at the time. Overall, official Chinese data tend to smooth out the impact of the business cycle, but a variety of alternative indicators point to the importance of cyclical trends, particularly in 2018. The deleveraging campaign had a meaningful effect on economic momentum in China, even if the intention of the campaign was simply to limit speculative activity in financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reinflating-the-property-bubble&quot;&gt;Reinflating the Property Bubble&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Property development has always been an industry heavily dependent upon credit growth. Yet when credit growth slowed sharply during the deleveraging campaign, the property sector grew, and the housing bubble became even larger, both in terms of new construction and prices. This was one of the most surprising consequences of the campaign itself. Property developers replaced financing from shadow banks with financing from leveraged home buyers in the form of housing purchases made before construction was complete. The effects of the deleveraging campaign also created the conditions for the more significant collapse of China’s housing market in 2021 and 2022. The developers that defaulted first in 2021 and 2022 were generally those that were most aggressive in leveraging up in 2017 and 2018, when the property sector was under pressure from the contracting shadow banking sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s residential housing market rapidly developed in the 2000s, mostly involving new construction from developers, while secondary market sales were slower to take off. Prices rose considerably as China’s urbanization rates and household incomes surged over the decade along with economic growth. Developers were incentivized to borrow aggressively and expand quickly, which involved bidding up prices for land. Setbacks in the housing market in 2008, 2011, and 2014 were very short-lived, and expectations for continued price growth remained strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One consequence of this history of rapid price growth was that developers could typically find buyers easily and could impose additional requirements on Chinese home buyers that other markets likely would not have been able to bear. As a result, developers were often able to collect 100 percent of the purchase price of homes based on floor plans alone after initially breaking ground on land. Home buyers would even start paying mortgages on properties they had not yet received. Developers increasingly came to rely on preconstruction sales of housing as a source of revenue. This was possible because home buyers believed housing values would generally rise, so they were less concerned about when exactly their final properties would be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign initially squeezed property developers’ financial conditions by restricting shadow financing channels. Property developers were among the largest borrowers from several types of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), particularly trust companies. When those channels of lending evaporated in 2017 and 2018, many property developers needed to preserve cash. Yu Liang, the head of Vanke, China’s largest real estate developer at the time, said the real estate market was at a “turning point” and emphasized that his goal for the company in 2018 was that it “survives.” Other large developers, such as Evergrande, were far less cautious in 2018 and continued to borrow aggressively and acquire land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Property developers changed their business model in two ways in order to ensure survival. First, they slowed construction on houses already in progress. This reduced immediate costs and outlays for these firms but also weakened China’s commodity demand and slowed the economy more broadly. This was partially responsible for the decline in consumer durables and white goods in 2018 because fewer houses were being completed, so people did not need as many appliances to fill their homes. Similarly, auto sales slowed, as these were typically correlated with property sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rdoIBHf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image24&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.3: Growth in Property Sales, Starts, Completions, and Sales of Existing Houses, 2016–2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: National Bureau of Statistics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, developers started relying upon preconstruction sales to generate additional revenues. This was very attractive to home builders because their cash outlays to prepare projects for sale were extremely limited, but then developers were obligated to eventually complete these units. As a result, throughout the deleveraging campaign, a strange divergence occurred in China’s housing market. New starts surged, rising by 20 percent in 2018, but sales of completed houses plummeted, declining by 26 percent in terms of floor space during the year (Figure 5.3). While total sales were weakening in 2017 and 2018, sales of preconstructed houses were still rising by 10 percent in 2018 in terms of floor space and an astonishing 22 percent in terms of revenue (Figure 5.4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, developers had shifted one form of credit to another, from borrowing from shadow lenders to borrowing from home buyers. Now they were responsible for delivering rising numbers of homes. This process also introduced some Ponzi-type elements of financing into China’s property sector, as the rush to raise money from presales was likely necessary because shadow banking loans were being called in. These loans were often high-interest, and many developers may have been pledging revenues for future home construction in order to repay legacy debt to shadow banks. In most markets, these proceeds for future construction were placed in escrow accounts, so there was little chance that home buyers could face defaults. However, as discovered when the housing market imploded in 2021 and 2022, the regulatory structure for China’s housing market was lax in enforcement, particularly among local governments, which had incentives to encourage property developers to expand aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/I5Du05G.png&quot; alt=&quot;image25&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.4: Developer Sales of Presold Units and Existing/Completed Units, June 2012–February 2019.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: National Bureau of Statistics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign also redirected more lending to home buyers in the form of mortgage loans. Banks wanted to extend loans to higher-interest borrowers, which were suddenly scarce because of the crackdown on shadow banking. A survey of banks’ results showed that the proportion of property-related lending, including mortgages and loans to developers, rose to 33 percent in 2018 from 24 percent in 2014 (Figure 5.5). This was contrary to the objectives of the broader deleveraging campaign to reduce systemic risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because housing prices were still rising, many home buyers were still willing to borrow in anticipation of further price appreciation. Total new household loans reached 7.3 trillion yuan in 2018 ($1.1 trillion), almost matching total corporate lending of 8.3 trillion yuan ($1.2 trillion). The pace of mortgage lending slowed in later years, but loans to households stayed in the same range of 6 to 8 trillion yuan per year from 2019 to 2021. This was an enormous volume of fuel for speculation in China’s housing market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3MPMTB9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image26&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, China saw one form of housing bubble — an excess of construction — replaced with another, a credit bubble from households to developers based on the promises of future construction. From the end of 2015 to June 2021, the total annual volume of presales revenues for developers nearly tripled, from 5.8 trillion yuan ($850 billion) to a peak of 16.3 trillion yuan ($2.4 trillion) (Figure 5.6). This credit expansion intensified during the deleveraging campaign, and its reversal created the credit crunch that would produce the spectacular collapse of China’s housing market in 2021 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-private-sector-is-squeezed&quot;&gt;The Private Sector Is Squeezed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s private sector has always faced difficulties in borrowing from the formal banking system. Loan officers in China have typically extended loans based on either government guarantees to SOEs or based on collateral. Private firms do not boast direct government support and typically have weaker asset bases. As a result, when they access credit from China’s banks, they typically pay higher interest rates, sometimes by paying fees to credit guarantee companies or by seeking other forms of credit enhancement. In turn, these firms are typically far more efficient in generating returns relative to SOEs, so they are capable of paying higher interest rates. The other consequence is that lending to the private sector tends to be shorter term, usually involving loans for working capital rather than project-based lending for investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the deleveraging campaign reduced overall corporate credit growth, mechanically this had a disproportionate impact on China’s private sector. Beijing’s approach to encouraging the private sector has ebbed and flowed over the years, with the common phrase guo jin min tui (“the state advances and the private sector retreats”) frequently used to describe conditions for private firms in the 2010s. When overall credit growth slows, state-owned firms typically maintain access to the banking system because of their political ties. The debt servicing needs of these firms have continued to rise as the volume of debt has expanded and interest costs have risen. As a result, the squeeze in overall lending in 2017 and 2018 tended to reduce credit to the private sector to a greater extent than credit to state-owned firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As banks lost access to financing, they needed to make more difficult choices in extending new loans, which usually meant private-sector firms lost access to working capital loans. Xu Gao, then with Everbright Securities, commented on this trend in 2019: “In an environment where credit is tightening, financing constraints of private enterprises are tightened even more, which makes the operating conditions of private enterprises worse than those of SOEs. This in turn strengthens risk aversion of financial institutions toward private enterprises, further tightening financing conditions for private firms.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of abundant financing from 2014 to 2017, net corporate bond issuance by private enterprises was negative most of the time after 2018 while SOEs’ net bond issuance remained at high levels (Figure 5.7). This resulted in a clear slowdown in industrial output of these firms, new investment, and job growth, given that private firms are responsible for around 80 percent of China’s overall urban employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/00zmuuI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image28&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.7: Net Corporate Bond Issuance by State-Owned and Private Firms, January 2009–October 2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: WIND.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of new credit risks was also problematic for private firms. As banks started to face defaults and losses on lending through NBFIs and third-party financial institutions, loan officers concerned about credit risk naturally pared back lending to the private sector. P2P lending networks were highly speculative but were involved in lending to smaller firms, even at high interest rates. The defaults and implosions of these platforms reversed some of private firms’ gains in access to financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the private sector, the broader slowdown in credit growth was a painful process because credit expansions do not necessarily benefit the private sector as much as credit crunches hurt private firms. Typically, countercyclical monetary policies involve incentivizing new investment projects through credit to state-owned firms and local governments. Eventually, there are spillover effects into the business environment for the private sector, but this requires time for the broader economy to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign and the corresponding structural slowdown in credit growth have created a much more restrictive financing environment for China’s private firms relative to the years of rapid credit expansion from 2009 to 2016. This will naturally reduce the overall efficiency of China’s financial system and reduce the productivity of new investment in China’s economy, weakening overall economic growth over the next decade, unless more significant structural reforms reverse this pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;downshift-in-inflationary-pressures&quot;&gt;Downshift in Inflationary Pressures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as private sector firms were cut off from credit as some financing channels contracted under deleveraging, China’s low- and middle-income consumers were similarly squeezed. Mortgage lending expanded significantly under the deleveraging campaign and fueled additional property sales, as previously discussed. But the collapse of P2P lenders and other shadow financing channels ended up closing some channels for household borrowing that had recently opened for lower-income households. Higher household borrowing to repay mortgage debt, in combination with reduced access to overall credit, ended up constraining household consumption growth in China following deleveraging. As a result, China has yet to see any meaningful consumer inflationary pressure since the deleveraging campaign, with core consumer price index (CPI) growth (excluding food and energy prices) trending downward consistently since 2018 and staying roughly around 1 percent for the past five years (Figure 5.8).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oeUAI6t.png&quot; alt=&quot;image29&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.8: Measures of China’s CPI, Core CPI, and Per Capita Consumer Spending, March 2015–December 2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: National Bureau of Statistics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when credit was expanding strongly in China from 2012 to 2016, the economy saw no meaningful inflationary pressures. Household income as a proportion of China’s economy remains extremely low, around 55 percent of GDP, in part because of the structure of China’s growth model. For years, low wages or household incomes were necessary to improve the competitiveness of China’s exports and to reduce barriers to new investment. The limitations on income have similarly constrained a rise in household consumption and consumer prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only rise in CPI above 3 percent in recent years has been the consequence of a significant disease in China’s hog population, which ended up severely limiting pork supply and pushing up prices temporarily. In part, low inflation also results from most new credit in China’s financial system being channeled to producers, even when demand weakens. The net result of this process, even during the years of strong credit growth from 2012 to 2016, was persistent deflationary pressure in producer prices as output continued expanding, with no strong pickup in consumer prices. The property market’s rebound in 2016 and 2017 generated some additional producer price pressure, along with the rise in commodity prices in 2021. But there has been no meaningful rise in consumer prices in China, indicating ongoing limitations on household income growth. The deleveraging campaign indirectly reinforced these processes, weakening consumers’ access to credit and introducing new caution concerning the broader economic outlook. This has reduced overall inflationary pressures within China’s economy, as evidenced by the sustained slowdown in core CPI growth since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fiscal-pressures-on-local-governments&quot;&gt;Fiscal Pressures on Local Governments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant impacts of the deleveraging campaign in China’s economy was its effect on local government fiscal conditions. Deleveraging pressured some of localities’ revenue channels directly but also compounded their problems in managing a rising debt burden. As a result, many local governments struggled to maintain infrastructure investment growth following the deleveraging campaign, and overall infrastructure spending has downshifted considerably since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deleveraging placed new pressure on property developers’ finances, which ended up meaningfully reducing their capacity to buy new land from local governments. Instead, developers were more eager to start projects from their existing land banks. As a result, growth in land sales slowed sharply in 2018 and 2019. Given that developers typically have a year to make payments to local governments for land parcels, the effect of this slowdown in land purchases lagged over a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the deleveraging campaign added to localities’ difficulties in managing debt. Many local governments had relied heavily upon LGFVs and shadow banking activity to fund investment. With those channels contracting, localities were forced to reduce new infrastructure investment but still needed to manage the legacy debt, which was more difficult to refinance and required spending from general government funds. In addition, part of the deleveraging effort included pressure on local governments to pay down implicit debt over a period of three to five years. Local governments needed to start considering other options such as selling state assets or privatization. Managing debt became a far more urgent priority as overall credit growth declined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defaults among local government SOEs became more common as a result of these pressures, even before the downturn in China’s property market. When the Henan provincial government reorganized the priorities of Yongcheng Coal, shifting funds that were allocated to repay bond investors toward other uses, the resulting November 2020 default on the bonds forced markets to consider localities as a source of risk for the first time rather than think about local government guarantees as a bulwark of stability. After Yongcheng Coal’s default, concerns about local government actions prevented any other firm from Henan province from issuing debt in China’s corporate bond market for over a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pressure on local government fiscal conditions has primarily been revealed through weaker infrastructure spending. Infrastructure investment growth as measured via fixed asset investment grew by only 3.8 percent in 2018 and 2019, 0.9 percent in 2020, and 0.4 percent in 2021, before rebounding in 2022. Local governments’ deteriorating fiscal balances and declining land sales revenues forced them to become more reliant upon a new channel for government borrowing: local government SRBs. In 2015, local governments reported a deficit in their fund budget for the first time (Figure 5.9). This fund budget consists of land sales revenues and spending categories that include the costs of redeveloping land for sale, as well as other categories of expenses separate from official budgetary spending. SRBs were first introduced to provide financing for the deficit in the fund budget, and issuance quickly expanded in the years ahead as deficits ballooned. Technically, these bonds are designed to fund only infrastructure projects and are not supposed to be used for general fiscal spending. But a significant proportion of the bonds issued from 2018 to 2022, usually around 20–30 percent, has been used for refinancing existing local government debt burdens. The Ministry of Finance imposes restrictions on the types of projects that must be funded with these SRBs so they do not add to implicit debts of localities. Because fewer projects met those criteria, the ministry was forced to relax some of these restrictions in early 2022, with infrastructure investment growth still under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-deleveraging-campaign-and-chinas-economy&quot;&gt;The Deleveraging Campaign and China’s Economy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign’s changes in the financial system extended to China’s real economy. The broader slowdown in credit clearly affected economic growth and squeezed private sector borrowing channels. The pressure on local governments’ implicit debts weakened local fiscal conditions and reduced infrastructure investment growth. Controls on consumer credit and employment prospects also reduced overall inflationary pressure in the economy. All of these effects were generally expected given the reliance of China’s economy on credit and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most surprising and unexpected developments, however, was that the deleveraging campaign ended up inflating China’s property market bubble further by replacing one form of borrowing from shadow banks with a larger channel of borrowing from households. As a result, the campaign ended up meaningfully amplifying one of the most important systemic risks in China’s economy and financial system. This risk started materializing in the summer of 2021 and into 2022 as property construction and sales plummeted, meaningfully weakening economic growth. The consequences for the financial system are still emerging, and it can be argued that the property bubble would have burst or deflated anyway, regardless of Beijing’s actions. But both the expected and unanticipated implications are necessary to make a broader assessment of China’s deleveraging campaign, based on Beijing’s original objectives and the actual impact on China’s longer-term economic trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessing-chinas-deleveraging-campaign&quot;&gt;Assessing China’s Deleveraging Campaign&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current slowdown in China’s property sector and the emergence of local government fiscal risks raise the question of how to assess the costs and benefits of the deleveraging campaign more broadly. The campaign contained some specific financial risks on the funding side of banks’ balance sheets while catalyzing new credit risks on the asset side. The balance is meaningful, and this chapter’s assessment of the deleveraging campaign’s successes and failures is based on the criteria that Beijing established for reducing systemic risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;credit-moral-hazard-and-chinas-economic-growth&quot;&gt;Credit, Moral Hazard, and China’s Economic Growth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core question of the deleveraging campaign’s effectiveness concerns China’s growth model, particularly since the 2007–08 global financial crisis. One view holds that China’s rapid credit growth and expansion of debt and investment via the shadow banking system were mistakes, abetted at times by policy decisions which contributed to speculative froth in multiple asset markets. After Beijing contained those risks and curtailed the role of the shadow banking system, economic growth should have reverted to a more sustainable pace. In this view, deleveraging was an important corrective to restore China’s economy to a more stable footing and eliminate important risks within the financial system. In addition, deleveraging was necessary to reduce borrowing costs for companies engaged in real investment rather than speculative ventures by controlling the growth of shadow banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative view, however, is that credit and investment growth, encouraged by widespread moral hazard throughout the financial system, was intrinsic to China’s economic expansion since the global financial crisis. By taking strong steps to limit credit growth, including within the shadow banking system, the deleveraging campaign was also likely to bring China’s postcrisis economic expansion to an end, pointing to much weaker growth in the future. This view points to the importance of the property sector in driving China’s growth since 2008, despite Beijing’s efforts to control the growth of the industry. Excessive property investment may have been unintended, but it was also one of the most important industries in China’s economy. In this view, there was little speculative froth in China’s credit expansion; the entire pattern of investment growth that resulted was unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With China’s economy now under considerable pressure from the property market’s decline, the debate between these two interpretations has become far more relevant. If the financial system continues to grow at a slower pace, acting as a constraint on new investment rather than enabling economic expansion, how fast can China’s economy reasonably be expected to grow? If the property sector continues to contract, what sort of limit does this place on China’s future economic expansion? What proportion of China’s economic growth over the past decade has been structural, and what proportion has been the by-product of an unprecedented credit expansion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign has facilitated new forms of credit risk, which will limit the future expansion of China’s financial system. Moral hazard is no longer widespread across China’s financial system, even if there is still some degree of confidence that the government will intervene to prevent financial contagion. Ever since the deleveraging campaign, risky assets, starting with peer-to-peer (P2P) lending networks, began defaulting in larger numbers, and eventually, even assets considered safer, such as smaller banks, bonds from large property developers, and local government state-owned enterprises (SOEs), were taking on losses. This reduced lenders’ willingness to extend new credit to larger and larger areas of China’s financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the financial system has already expanded so rapidly, now holding 377 trillion yuan ($55.4 trillion) in assets or over half of global GDP, previous rates of credit growth above 15 percent are not possible, as this would involve credit growth totaling around half of China’s economic output every year, well above even the 2009 pace of new lending immediately after the global financial crisis. Credit growth will slow in the future, and GDP growth will likely slow along with it. The question is how steep the decline will be, which depends upon what other asset classes will begin to default and therefore trigger additional market concerns about credit risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the primary concerns is that local government financing vehicles (LGFVs), which have already defaulted on shadow banking instruments, will start to default on their publicly traded bonds. This would create new credit risk in around 40 percent of China’s 33 trillion yuan ($4.8 trillion) corporate bond market and would also likely reduce a significant source of credit demand for smaller banks. It would also significantly reduce local government infrastructure investment, which has been almost as large a driver of investment growth as the property sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is far more evidence that contraction in the shadow banking system has limited credit to real borrowers, not just speculative froth. As a result, as credit growth has slowed following the deleveraging campaign, China’s economic growth will appear different in the future. Marginal returns to new investment via property and local government infrastructure will not be the same as in the past, given declining credit availability. Growth will be powered by different drivers, including household consumption. Based on the economy’s performance since 2018, it will also be slower overall. The question in evaluating the deleveraging campaign becomes whether the medicine that Beijing applied was effective in treating the disease of speculative activity in the shadow banking system or whether it left the economy unable to continue sustainable economic expansion in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;analyses-of-the-deleveraging-campaign&quot;&gt;Analyses of the Deleveraging Campaign&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the campaign intensified in 2018, Beijing’s deleveraging efforts have seldom been discussed in their entirety as a multiyear policy effort using a combination of monetary and regulatory tightening measures. Usually, the campaign is mentioned in the China economics literature as a series of stand-alone actions targeting specific types of shadow banking transactions and institutions. In general, available published analyses make four types of arguments about the campaign’s effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first emphasizes the deleveraging campaign’s success as a proactive measure to eliminate an emerging systemic financial risk in 2016. As a result, the campaign is a demonstration of Chinese authorities’ effectiveness and adaptability in response to systemic challenges. Tom Orlik’s The Bubble That Never Pops features an entire chapter on the deleveraging campaign called “Deleveraging without Self-Detonating,” which generally describes the effort favorably. Orlik argues, “A year and a half into the deleveraging campaign, China’s policymakers had achieved faster growth, a steady debt-to-GDP ratio, and a shrinking shadow banking sector.” Orlik credits “the underlying resilience of the economy and financial system, the underappreciated ingenuity of policymakers, and the unusual resources of an authoritarian state” as responsible for deleveraging’s effectiveness. As a result, he argues that because shadow financing activity was mostly funding speculation in China’s financial markets rather than borrowing in the real economy, the effect of deleveraging on overall economic growth was marginal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s public accounting of the deleveraging campaign’s successes was similar in tone. The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) issued a public working paper in December 2020 discussing the broader effort to control financial risks and summarized the results as follows: “Not only has the scale of shadow banking been greatly reduced, but more importantly, operations have become more standardized, structures have been simplified . . . and systemic risks and hidden dangers have been curtailed.” Furthermore, the CBIRC’s assessment claimed that the deleveraging campaign had also reduced international criticism of China’s financial management: “After 2017, international assessments have completely changed, and now affirm the remarkable achievements of China’s governance of shadow banking, not only ensuring the stability of China’s financial system, but also becoming the driving force for the decline in global shadow banking.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second set of arguments discussing the deleveraging campaign usually comes from Chinese analysts and claims that deleveraging was overdone or excessive. These analysts flag the government’s need to relax some of the controls on shadow banking activity by the end of 2018 and push back against the extreme tightening of credit conditions, particularly for local government or the private sector. Shadow banking activity, in these arguments, was still essential for powering the economy, specifically for local governments. Some analysts with this line of reasoning argued that China’s previous accumulation of debt was not excessive and was simply a by-product of China’s growth model. Consistent with most of these accounts, Beijing started to relax its campaign to control local governments’ implicit debt levels by the end of 2018, allowing localities and LGFVs to roll over some of their own borrowing. Official local government infrastructure investment growth had plummeted from 19 percent in 2017 to 3.8 percent in 2018, triggering an adjustment from Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example of this line of argument came from People’s Bank of China (PBOC) officials, including former research director Xu Zhong, who criticized a one-size-fits-all deleveraging process. Xu wrote in a 2019 Caixin commentary, “Cleaning up local debts has been done too hastily starting last year, and the downward pressure on the economy has led to declining local government assets, making local governments face increased risks and uncertainties.” Xu Gao from Everbright Securities made a similar argument in February 2019, claiming that the unintended effect of deleveraging was actually contrary to the policy’s original intention, boosting leverage ratios among private enterprises and tightening credit conditions among these firms through a rise in borrowing costs. The National Finance and Development Laboratory, a research institution under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, argued that deleveraging corporate balance sheets contributed to balance sheet recession risks, as reduction of overall debt levels reduced prospects for new investment. The 2021 report argues, “China’s macro leverage ratio has declined for three consecutive quarters. However, problems such as the slowing recovery of the real economy, ongoing enterprise deleveraging, and rising risks of defaults among urban investment companies may still bring hidden worries to the Chinese economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third category of assessments generally makes the argument that deleveraging has not achieved very much at all, simply because it has not actually occurred. These analysts focus on the fact that China’s credit growth in headline terms continued expanding faster than GDP, and there was still considerable speculative activity in China’s economy underway, despite the crackdown on shadow banking activity. For the analysts in the “deleveraging did not happen” camp, business as usual continued within China’s economy and financial system, and the deleveraging campaign was ineffective despite Beijing’s high-profile attention to the subject, indicating broader policy failures. Leland Miller of China Beige Book, for example, has argued extensively that the shadow financing crackdown did not have meaningful impact on overall borrowing via informal channels in China’s financial system and that available data showed “no sign of retrenchment of either overall credit provision or shadow finance specifically” by the start of 2020. Christopher Balding made a similar case in early 2018, arguing, “Much of the financial deleveraging that has taken place has simply moved into other instruments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fourth set of assessments is more balanced and typically retrospective in nature. Written in 2021 or 2022 rather than at the height of the deleveraging campaign in 2018, these explanations essentially argue that the campaign had some modest accomplishments in managing shadow banking risks or controlling the rise of debt-to-GDP ratios but left other problems within the financial system unaddressed. For example, Shuli Ren of Bloomberg wrote in late 2022 that the deleveraging campaign had on balance reduced financial risks in China and made it “a much safer place to put your money,” even while acknowledging the rising leverage among LGFVs and problems in managing the fallout within the property sector. Hung Tran, formerly of the International Monetary Fund, similarly argued that deleveraging is a necessary process that Beijing is managing to reduce the economy’s reliance upon credit, even if it will produce much slower economic growth in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evaluating-the-deleveraging-campaign-on-beijings-terms&quot;&gt;Evaluating the Deleveraging Campaign on Beijing’s Terms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are multiple arguments about the balance of costs and benefits from the deleveraging campaign, the assessment that is probably most important concerns Beijing’s priorities. Financial and economic analysts may have their own views, but Beijing had clear reasons for launching the deleveraging campaign, as outlined in Chapter 2. Beijing’s primary objectives were to eliminate the political risks that had emerged from the rapid growth of the shadow banking sector and authorities’ inability to control the financial system. Specifically, Beijing attempted to control the rising pace of credit growth and debt-to-GDP ratios, eliminate systemic risks from the shadow banking system and wealth management products (WMPs), reduce the pressures on the economy and fiscal system from local government debt, and reduce debt levels and burdens among SOEs. The section below evaluates the progress of the deleveraging campaign with reference to these specific objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slowing the Pace of Credit Growth and Limiting the Rise in Debt-to-GDP Ratios:&lt;/strong&gt; By this overarching metric, the deleveraging campaign was successful. Credit growth, as mentioned in Chapters 4 and 5, was cut roughly in half under pressure from both monetary and regulatory tightening steps. Estimated credit-to-GDP ratios, using a weighted average measure of adjusted total social financing (TSF) growth and bank asset growth, rose from 172 percent in 2008 to 261 percent at the end of 2016. By 2018, that ratio had declined to 250 percent. It continued to rise in 2020 after the Covid-19 pandemic slowed GDP growth and required emergency lending, but this was unrelated to previous efforts to control financial risks. At the start of the deleveraging campaign, the overriding question was whether or not Beijing would have the stomach to actually slow credit growth and expose Chinese companies and financial institutions to credit risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, at least some financial technocrats were willing to countenance those risks, even as they arrived in 2018. However, it was not easy to maintain political support for the slowdown in credit growth. Even though China’s top leadership had mandated deleveraging and reducing financial risks, few SOEs or local governments were willing to have their access to financing cut down. The deleveraging campaign limited shadow financing channels, which were generally larger than Beijing had anticipated. As a result, many of the borrowers from shadow banks — property developers, local governments, and their LGFVs — would have been the primary political opponents of the campaign. But shadow banks had limited direct political support. It was difficult for anyone in the Chinese system to argue that financial institutions should extend large volumes of credit outside of Beijing’s regulatory oversight. As a result, local governments and property developers were not very effective in pushing back against the newfound regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOEs were different, though, as banks started to redirect credit toward households and away from corporations. Throughout the deleveraging campaign, household debt-to-GDP ratios rose, while corporate debt-to-GDP ratios declined. The PBOC was interested in maintaining controls on overall credit but needed to manage the internal perception that credit growth was collapsing. It is probably not a coincidence that the central bank changed its calculation methods for aggregate credit growth (TSF growth) four times over the course of the deleveraging campaign in 2018 and 2019 (Figure 6.1). All of the adjustments had the effect of boosting headline credit growth, generally by incorporating new components within TSF. These included issuance of asset-backed securities and loans written off by banks (included in July 2018) and, most controversially, central government bonds (included in December 2019), which were generally considered an instrument of fiscal policy rather than a component of credit to the nonfinancial corporate sector. While the PBOC’s motivations in adjusting the data remain unknowable, the revised data series smoothed out the overall decline in credit growth, which could be used to argue that the deleveraging campaign had not had a significant impact on preferred credit channels. The reality was that credit growth was slowing sharply in 2017 and 2018, as indicated by the decline in bank asset growth. This was consistent with Beijing’s initial objectives, even if it was difficult for the PBOC to maintain political support for its efforts across the bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminating Systemic Risks from Shadow Banking Activities and WMPs:&lt;/strong&gt; The deleveraging campaign made significant progress in reducing the risk China’s banks would suffer from a funding squeeze similar to the June 2013 interbank market crisis. Efforts to control the shadow banking sector took aim not only at the shadow lenders but also at the funding instruments themselves. Regulations designed to mark the assets of WMPs to market prices informed investors that losses on such products were possible, which reduced their attractiveness and overall issuance volumes. As a result, banks no longer relied as heavily upon WMPs as a source of funding, so there was a much smaller risk that banks could not roll over a significant funding channel if money market conditions tightened considerably. Even though negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) and structured deposits became much more prominent financing tools for banks replacing WMPs, they were also targeted by subsequent regulatory measures that were generally effective in limiting their growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, shadow banking assets contracted outright by virtually any measure in 2017 and 2018. This was clearly revealed within the official bank assets data, though the data do not comprehensively cover all shadow banking channels, as discussed previously. The CBIRC working paper reviewing the accomplishments of the deleveraging campaign claimed that, by the end of 2019, a broad measure of shadow banking assets had declined by 16 trillion yuan ($2.4 trillion) since the end of 2017, whereas a narrow measure was down by around 12 trillion yuan ($1.8 trillion) from its peak. By any reasonable metric, China’s shadow banking sector — the trust companies, asset management companies, brokerages with custody of bank loans, and P2P lenders — was much smaller and posed less of a systemic risk to China’s financial system than before the deleveraging campaign began in 2016. This was a clear success on the basis of Beijing’s original objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caveat is that this success in containing shadow banking activity did not necessarily translate into minimizing systemic financial risks. By controlling one form of risk on the funding side of banks’ balance sheets, the deleveraging campaign clearly contributed to credit risks on the other side of the balance sheet, as borrowers were increasingly cut off from refinancing channels. Those credit risks started to materialize in larger volumes and gradually extended to more asset classes as well. As Credit and Credibility argues, this process of paring back government guarantees and introducing new credit risks remains the most probable path to a systemic crisis in China’s financial system. When investors cannot know how Beijing’s intentions to provide guarantees are changing, contagion can spread as guarantees are questioned in more and more asset classes. Rather than investors relying upon protection from Beijing’s guarantees, the new uncertainty concerning more and more assets that can default has created the potential for additional financial contagion and systemic risks. It is difficult for any investor to know at what point Beijing will be comfortable with the rise in credit risk versus uncomfortable about the potential financial contagion that could result from widespread risk aversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the deleveraging campaign reinflated China’s largest financial bubble — the residential housing market. In addition, deleveraging shifted the risks of the bubble bursting into direct costs from homeowners facing the prospect of houses that might not be delivered instead of developers owing money to unstable financial institutions. When developers repaid shadow banks calling in their credit lines, they did so with money from home buyers who had taken out mortgage loans. The entire property sector became far more reliant upon preconstruction sales as a source of financing, which was arguably riskier than developers borrowing from shadow lenders. Rather than be hit by deleveraging, developers expanded their overall borrowing and reinflated property starts to new highs as an alternative source of financing. As a result, the deleveraging campaign arguably contributed to systemic risks from a property market collapse while attempting to address shadow banking challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing Economic Pressures from Rising Local Government Debt:&lt;/strong&gt; Very little progress was made in reducing the debt of local governments or the corresponding constraints on future growth, despite Beijing’s efforts to reduce implicit debt and to crack down on shadow financing channels. Generally speaking, local government debt continued rising throughout the deleveraging campaign, including the short-term interest burden from LGFVs. Estimated total debt from LGFVs rose from 24.1 trillion yuan ($3.5 trillion) in 2016 to 56.7 trillion yuan ($8.3 trillion) in 2021, with a steady rise each year (Figure 6.2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zrNvjo3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image32&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6.2: Total Interest-Bearing Debt plus Payables from LGFVs, 2015–2021.&lt;/strong&gt; Sources: WIND and LGFV annual reports; Rhodium Group calculations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though local governments were cut off from shadow financing channels, they had opportunities to borrow directly from the formal banking system and were able to crowd out other borrowers, including private sector firms. Through this process, the overall efficiency of China’s financial system in generating economic growth declined, with more new credit being channeled to repay existing debt rather than fund more productive activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even now, one of the most pressing potential risks to China’s financial system is the possibility that LGFV bonds might start defaulting in large numbers, indicating the continued salience of local government debt risks. The deleveraging campaign made very little progress in minimizing or eliminating these risks, with declining infrastructure investment since 2017 indicating the structural challenges posed by rising debt servicing costs for LGFVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing Debt Levels of SOEs to Improve Efficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; SOEs did not meaningfully reduce their debt levels throughout the deleveraging campaign, despite targets to do so. These targets were delivered in September 2018 when the Party Central Committee and the State Council required all SOEs to cut leverage by 2 percentage points from 2017 levels by the end of 2020. Generally, few firms actually reduced overall debt levels, as they were able to maintain access to credit from the banking system, and private sector firms suffered disproportionately. In addition, one of the primary tools Beijing had anticipated for reducing SOE leverage, debt-to-equity swaps, never accelerated during the deleveraging campaign, as banks were unwilling to take the additional risks attached to equity holdings in state-owned companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the signs of the continued pressure from SOE debt burdens was the surge in issuance of SOEs’ perpetual bonds in late 2018 and early 2019. Perpetual bonds are classified as equity rather than debt and would therefore allow SOEs to meet some of their requirements for reducing formal debt levels. Usually, these bonds are three or five years in duration, with a call option for the issuer to extend the bond’s duration, making them “perpetual.” Issuance of these bonds surged at the end of 2018, as SOEs were scrambling to meet their targets. But in reality, the perpetual bonds were simply higher-interest debt that technically increased SOEs’ overall debt servicing costs and the risks associated with rising debt levels. This was not a meaningful reduction in systemic risks associated with SOE debt levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-the-deleveraging-campaign-reveals-about-chinas-economy&quot;&gt;What the Deleveraging Campaign Reveals about China’s Economy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign made significant inroads against certain types of systemic financial risks in China — those associated with funding stress on the liabilities side of banks’ balance sheets and the potential linkages between banks and riskier nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs). By the end of 2018, the risk of a June 2013–style liquidity crisis in which banks struggled to meet liquidity demand from WMP redemptions was substantially lower than at the start of the deleveraging campaign in May 2016. Similarly, the overall size of the informal financial sector shrank in 2017 and 2018, and risks from bad loans within that sector correspondingly declined. When P2P networks started imploding, they were not intertwined enough within China’s financial system to have a meaningful impact on China’s banks or major borrowers. In those aspects, the deleveraging campaign made China’s broader financial system safer and more stable, even if overall economic growth slowed and new credit risks emerged in individual sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flip side of this suppression of risks on the liabilities or funding side of banks’ balance sheets was the creation of new risks on the asset or lending side. Simply put, by shrinking credit available to corporate borrowers who had depended upon cheap credit and soft budget constraints for years, many firms were now cut off from financing and had to make difficult decisions about hiring, new investment, and repaying their debt. Throughout this process, state-owned firms and local governments managed to maintain access to the formal banking system, while private firms were disproportionately affected by the slowdown in credit growth. Low-income households were suddenly deprived of credit as well, as lending to these riskier borrowers without credit histories naturally required lenders willing to take additional risk and seeking higher yields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow banking, while generating new risks, had also been the primary channel for financial deepening — the expansion of financial services to new borrowers — within China’s staid and conservative banking system, which had always prioritized stability over efficiency or innovation. The potential for shadow banks to bypass the state-owned banking oligopolies and allow small businesses, sole proprietorships, and low-income households to obtain credit for the first time was one of the primary reasons China’s reformers and financial technocrats wanted to see these channels expand and at first took a more permissive attitude toward prudential regulation. The lending was risky in aggregate, but any expansion of finance to new borrowers was likely to entail new risks. In the course of attacking shadow banks, the deleveraging campaign also reversed meaningful steps in China’s financial deepening and left smaller private borrowers and low-income households scrambling for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replacing funding risks with credit risks was a fairly predictable consequence of the deleveraging campaign, which could have been reasonably expected as credit slowed. Property developers’ redirection of shadow credit into borrowing from home buyers was almost completely unexpected. The property industry relied heavily upon credit and borrowing from shadow banks in particular. So when shadow banks contracted meaningfully in 2017 and 2018, it was highly surprising that plans for new housing construction actually started accelerating (Figure 6.3). Developers could borrow from homeowners, taking out mortgages to repay loans to shadow banks. As a result, the housing bubble reinflated and required blunter measures such as the “three red lines” restricting developers’ overall borrowing to contain the growth in the sector. The deleveraging campaign created both predictable and unanticipated consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/80B2c8D.png&quot; alt=&quot;image33&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6.3: Annualized Property Starts, Sales, and Completions, January 2001–October 2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: National Bureau of Statistics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the deleveraging campaign broke the assumption of explicit and implicit guarantees throughout China’s financial system. Through signaling from China’s political leadership, the crackdown on shadow banks created new political signals that Chinese authorities were comfortable with a certain degree of financial instability. Even protests surrounding the implosions of P2P networks in the heart of Beijing in August 2018 did not move authorities to intervene and support these institutions, as had been common in the past. Defaults became increasingly probable in multiple asset classes, moving closer to core areas of government support, including local government state-owned firms and trust companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet while moral hazard across China’s broader financial system was broken, the problem of implicit government guarantees within some asset markets was not. Central state-owned firms and LGFVs were still assumed to be guaranteed because none of these firms had yet defaulted. So as overall credit growth declined, financial resources redirected to the only “safe” areas of the economy, even though these were the least efficient firms in terms of their ability to generate economic returns from new investment. Deleveraging did little to correct the problems of the outsized role of SOEs within China’s economy and, ironically, strengthened their importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the notable successes of the deleveraging campaign did not necessarily improve the sustainability of China’s economic growth for the next decade. Credit growth at high rates was intrinsic to the rapid economic growth in China following the global financial crisis. With the property sector now meaningfully contracting and returns on local government infrastructure investment naturally declining, Beijing is left to look for other drivers of growth, with few easy options given the costs of managing the legacy debt from past investments. As overall credit growth slows, investment will slow as well. Construction of residential or commercial property or infrastructure is unlikely to be a structural driver of economic growth in the future. Even as household savings rates fall as China’s population ages, consumption-led growth will be slower than investment-led growth, mostly because consumption is constrained by incomes, and household incomes in China remain at low levels, around 60 percent of GDP. Disposable incomes after taxes and social insurance contributions are generally lower, below 50 percent of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structural slowdown in credit growth will induce an endogenous slowdown in new investment and GDP growth as well. Beijing has no realistic option to accelerate credit growth to the roughly 15 percent pace seen in the 2010s, given the existing size of the financial system and the sudden emergence of credit risk driving multiple lenders to be cautious in lending. The deleveraging campaign that started in 2016 marked the peak of China’s credit-driven economic growth model. As credit growth slowed, prospects for China’s future economic expansion correspondingly declined. The deleveraging campaign was highly necessary to eliminate near-term financial risk but insufficient to lay the foundation for more stable and sustainable growth in China’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign’s results highlight the limited degree of control that policymakers have over economic outcomes, even within an authoritarian state-controlled financial system such as China’s. Controlling credit growth was dangerous, even if failing to act and allowing systemic risks to build in 2017 and 2018 would have been far worse and may have created a different type of financial crisis. Reining in financial risks and volatility in financial markets by reimposing controls and regulatory restrictions on certain types of borrowing and lending limits dynamism in the economy and creates volatility elsewhere within the financial system. Following the global financial crisis, China’s policymakers had been willing to countenance more financial risks and volatility as a counterweight to political risks and potential instability. The deleveraging campaign was designed to curtail financial risks, which ended up creating new economic and political risks, particularly from property developers’ unfinished houses. Policymakers cannot control market outcomes in China’s financial system, and there remains no magic solution to deflate an unprecedented credit bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deleveraging-and-chinas-political-transition&quot;&gt;Deleveraging and China’s Political Transition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deleveraging arguably came far too late in China. Had the PBOC stood its ground in the aftermath of the June 2013 interbank market crisis and moved forward with an aggressive monetary and regulatory tightening agenda after delivering a shot across the bow of the banking system, the costs of adjustment would have been far lower. But there was clearly no political constituency in China that could have sustained a prolonged deleveraging campaign in 2013, nor a political structure that could have approved such a campaign. In the first year of Chinese president Xi Jinping’s administration, China’s economic decisionmaking was still driven primarily via multiple inputs into the State Council and the Economic and Financial Leading Small Group. Decisionmaking involved compromises, even if there was no complete consensus among policymakers, but multiple inputs into the policymaking process were likely to be heard. Local governments and SOEs would be able to push back against the PBOC’s calls for more aggressive regulation, particularly monetary tightening. After all, in 2013, shadow banks were just starting to ramp up their activities, and the risks were not apparent to most outside of the financial system. Following the global financial crisis, Beijing had been comfortable with trade-offs favoring stronger economic growth, even if financial risks were rising as a result. Regulatory oversight of the shadow banking system was still conflicted among several different institutions as well. It would take time to build the internal political case for a more aggressive deleveraging campaign in China, and those conditions were not present in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign arrived in the later years of Xi’s first term, when consensus-driven policymaking was still the norm in China. Chapter 2 described the formation of the political consensus behind deleveraging, as the multiple bubbles and extensive speculation in China’s financial markets exposed the systemic risks that were building. This allowed financial technocrats to overcome objections from local governments, as shadow banks had weak bases of political support. The increasing centralization of authority under Xi and the regulatory restructuring creating the Financial Stability and Development Committee helped to reinforce the political importance of deleveraging and created conditions for sustaining the campaign despite its impact on the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centralization of power in China under Xi and his direct support for certain policy initiatives made it far more difficult for those policies to be reversed, unless Xi himself reversed them publicly. As a result, when Xi publicly identified with the phrase “houses are for living, not for speculation,” it was a reasonable conclusion that any support Beijing would provide for the property sector would be limited, since Xi wanted to see lower levels of speculation. Similarly, crackdowns against education technology firms and internet platform companies in 2021 were seen as part of a broader political campaign to promote “common prosperity” in China. Despite the impact of these regulatory efforts on economic growth, Beijing pushed through, raising new questions about what Xi’s priorities actually were and where maintaining economic growth or financial stability might fit within a new set of politically determined objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under collective leadership, government guarantees of financial assets had more force and credibility behind them because there would be multiple voices in favor of stability and these voices would be heard in the policymaking process at some level. In contrast, under centralized leadership, government guarantees were now vulnerable if perceptions of Xi’s preferences changed, while other voices were far less prominent in decisionmaking. This process of political centralization accelerated the unwinding of China’s credit and property bubbles by exposing more assets to new default risks and increasing risk aversion among lenders. It is impossible to assess the legacy of the deleveraging campaign without considering how the increasing centralization of political power influenced its effectiveness and amplified the effect of both monetary and regulatory tightening steps. Regulatory actions initiated in 2013 would not have had the same force and impact on market perceptions of risk within China’s financial system as those in 2021 and 2022, and the centralization of power in China was a critical factor behind that change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, China’s deleveraging campaign exposed the inefficiency of China’s unreformed economic growth model by stripping away the credit growth that had maintained rapid rates of economic expansion, despite the inefficiencies of the state’s role within the economy. The PBOC initiated both monetary and regulatory changes, but the effectiveness of these steps was limited by the state’s role within the economy and the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than reduce borrowing costs for the “real economy,” cracking down on informal financial channels raised costs and squeezed finances for the private sector, while banks maintained lending to inefficient state-owned borrowers and local governments. Their implicit guarantees remained intact, despite the deleveraging campaign, because of state-owned firms and localities’ heft within China’s political structure, not because of their economic efficiency or performance. This is not a critique of the deleveraging campaign itself, but its impact within China’s political system was always going to be tempered by the nature of the Chinese state and the impact of state participation within the financial system. Deleveraging ended China’s unprecedented credit bubble, which revealed the limits of relying upon a state-directed and investment-led growth model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-upcoming-policy-choices-and-implications-for-the-united-states&quot;&gt;China’s Upcoming Policy Choices and Implications for the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign launched in 2016 marked one of the most significant efforts Beijing has made to counter systemic risks within its financial system and implicitly shift its economic growth model. But in the campaign’s aftermath, following the contraction of the shadow banking sector, China now faces an unprecedented series of economic challenges and few options to maintain a pace of economic growth in line with the leadership’s objectives to double per capita GDP between 2020 and 2035. Neither the property sector nor local government infrastructure investment can serve as a driver of economic expansion. Credit growth overall will slow from current levels as the financial system expands at a slower rate than the real economy, reversing the trend seen over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing is also losing control over its ability to influence the economy with fiscal policy, given the rising levels of local government debt and the pressure of debt service on future spending capacity. Local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) are already defaulting on some forms of borrowing and are increasingly at risk of defaulting on bonds. An inability to maintain financing access to these vehicles would effectively limit Beijing’s ability to use fiscal policy to drive additional investment and maintain growth. Some form of bailout of China’s localities will be necessary in the years ahead, most likely using fiscal resources or an expansion of funding from the central bank’s balance sheet. A recent article in the journal Qiushi (“Seeking Truth”) seemed to flag the necessity of such a restructuring of local government debt, with the need to extend maturities of local government debt and reduce interest rates. After such a bailout, additional long-term sources of revenue for China’s local governments, most likely including new taxes, will be necessary. Both credit-fueled investment from state-owned companies and local government infrastructure investment cannot be the answer to Beijing’s search for new drivers of economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, China’s demographic realities are now tempering Beijing’s economic ambitions. Before the release of 2020 census data in May 2021, most independent estimates of China’s population trajectory placed the country’s population peak in the late 2020s or early 2030s. But birth rates have collapsed in recent years, amplified by the pandemic. Total births in China reached only 9.6 million in 2022, down from 17.9 million in 2016 and 10.6 million in 2021. As a result, China’s overall population declined in 2022, nine years after the working-age population peaked and began declining in 2013. These demographic headwinds are new obstacles to continued growth that Beijing could not have anticipated when formulating its long-term economic plans just a few years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some challenges are far more pressing, including managing the financial fallout from the property sector’s decline and rising credit risks as defaults and insolvencies continue to grow. The property sector benefited disproportionately from China’s record-breaking credit expansion, so the losses from both mortgage loans and loans to developers will impact the financial institutions that extended them. So far, mortgage loans appear to be safer, but the extent of the decline in overall property prices remains unclear and could accelerate. Smaller banks are rapidly reorganizing and consolidating to improve their overall balance sheets to meet regulatory limits. Credit risks from corporate bonds and commercial acceptances (short-term financing issued by companies themselves) are rising as the economy slows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) conducted stress tests in which “severely adverse” scenarios for GDP growth were placed at 4.15 percent. Since then, the economy has seen two years of official growth below those levels — in 2020 and 2022. There are reasonable arguments that 2022 economic growth was negative given the adverse impacts of lockdowns and Covid-19 restrictions on both investment and household consumption. Average growth rates during the three years of the pandemic were only 4.5 percent, even based on official data. Before the slowdown during the pandemic, Beijing did not consider the economic growth rates China has seen over the past three years as within the reasonable range of probabilities. Now, it remains unclear how China can maintain growth close to these levels over the next decade without relying upon the property sector, infrastructure investment, or rapid credit expansion. The deleveraging campaign marked the sunset of China’s previous economic growth model, giving Beijing some stark options to adjust its strategic approach from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;state-and-market-forces-in-chinas-financial-system&quot;&gt;State and Market Forces in China’s Financial System&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign also highlights the difficulties of reform within a hybrid economic and financial system where the state retains a significant role among both borrowers and lenders, which can distort market signals to private enterprises. One of the effects of the campaign was that private firms’ sources of financing were squeezed while the risk of default among private enterprises rose, in contrast to state firms, which were still perceived to be guaranteed. As a result, the deleveraging campaign reversed some of the progress of reforms designed to expand private sector access to financing overall and improve the broader efficiency of the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the property market adjustment continues, the same dynamic is repeating itself. Heavily leveraged private developers are now struggling to borrow, given the broader risk aversion from lenders to the sector. Banks are being instructed to increase credit to the property sector overall, but lenders only feel comfortable extending loans to state-owned firms. As sales revenues continue declining, state-owned developers will likely be able to acquire the assets of more distressed private developers, increasing the presence of state firms within the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest rate adjustments can similarly have unintended effects in half-reformed financial systems. State firms and state banks almost always distort signals that should emerge from market-based pricing of capital. China’s deposit and lending rates were previously administratively set in order to guarantee some profits for state-owned banks while keeping borrowing costs for state-owned companies low, in order to generate incentives for investment. By 2015, lending rates were fully liberalized, and the PBOC abolished the formal ceiling of deposit rates relative to a benchmark rate. In theory, this meant that banks could offer higher deposit rates to attract funding, but in practice, banks continued to use informal coordination among themselves to keep these deposit rates low and prevent banks from competing based on interest rates. The benchmark deposit rate remains in place today as the unreformed portion of China’s interest rate system. As a result, banks remain in an uncertain position in managing their own financial conditions, with funding rates still largely set via administrative fiat while lending rates respond more meaningfully to market forces. These distortions have prevented Beijing from stimulating credit growth when the economy slows, as banks remain unable to push down borrowing rates by sufficient margins to generate credit demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the goals of the deleveraging campaign was to reduce the influence of the shadow banking system, which lends at high interest rates, in order to allow borrowers in the “real economy” to access credit at lower borrowing rates that are more sustainable. But even after shadow banks retreated, formal banks were reluctant to lend at lower rates and resisted multiple attempts to pass on lower funding costs to final borrowers. In the opposite direction, pushing interest rates higher to reduce credit demand and control overall financial system growth can, ironically, increase financial risks if state-owned borrowers are insensitive to rising interest costs and then push up interest rates for private borrowers by larger margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage, even if structural reform efforts move forward with greater speed, it seems extremely unlikely that state ownership of the banking system will change, that state-owned enterprizes (SOEs) will become a much smaller force within China’s economy, or that SOEs will quickly lose access to credit from state banks. The result is that the rest of the world will need to confront engagement with a Chinese financial system that continues to see meaningful state-led distortions in the pricing of capital and the allocation of credit. Conventional wisdom suggests that liberalizing China’s financial markets and permitting more foreign participation would be beneficial in breaking down some of these constraints and improving efficiency in China’s allocation of capital. But if those market mechanisms simply will not operate for significant proportions of borrowers and lenders within China’s economy, and those borrowers and lenders become more important forces within the economy over time, then the benefits of liberalization and foreign participation in markets will be similarly limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;centralization-of-political-power-and-credibility-of-chinas-policymaking&quot;&gt;Centralization of Political Power and Credibility of China’s Policymaking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of the deleveraging campaign, starting in 2016, reveals changes in the adaptability of China’s policymaking over time as well. The campaign designed to remake China’s economic growth model started with an aggressive leadership messaging effort to build consensus across China’s bureaucracy. Then technocrats in the financial bureaucracies, primarily at the PBOC, started the aggressive monetary and regulatory tightening efforts necessary to control shadow banking and bring down overall credit growth. But those technocrats struggled to maintain the political consensus behind deleveraging, given widespread pushback from SOEs, local governments, and other Chinese officials more interested in maintaining economic growth than controlling credit and financial risks. Even though the campaign was led from the top, there was always a consensus-oriented element necessary to maintain political momentum in controlling credit growth and shadow banking activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another campaign, launched just five years later, in 2021, appeared very different in scope and mechanics, though the objective was the same: restructuring China’s current pattern of economic growth and reorienting goals around “common prosperity.” The new campaign was designed to limit the influence of technology giants and internet platform companies on the economy, including the effort to reverse Didi’s initial public offering in the United States and similar regulatory efforts targeting Alibaba, Meituan, Tencent, and other firms. Those actions were followed by a surprise regulatory change to suddenly outlaw the profitability, capital raising, and equity listings of education firms in July 2021, presumably as an effort to reduce the rising cost of raising and educating children as China’s birth rate declined. These regulatory changes, announced quickly and without warning, shocked financial markets and forced financial technocrats to defend the government’s actions to foreign investors in an effort to manage the fallout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important trends occurring between these two campaigns was the rising centralization of authority in China under Xi Jinping. In early 2018, the CCP set events in motion that effectively ended term limits for the position of general secretary, allowing Xi to remain in his position for a third term starting in 2022, longer than the norm of two terms established under Deng Xiaoping’s bureaucratic reforms in the 1980s. That shift had a meaningful impact on Chinese policymaking as well, as decisionmaking authority started to move away from more conventional technocratic organizations under the State Council toward CCP-led organizations where Xi exercised a more direct role. Policymaking conducted by political campaign is far less predictable and operates contrary to the requirements of a market-driven economy, where rules and incentives of regulatory institutions are more transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of China’s “zero-Covid” policy was another powerful example of this trend of centralization of authority. Despite the rising costs of the draconian controls on people’s movement and onerous testing requirements, the identification of Covid-19 policy with Xi personally meant that local officials continued to compete with one another to strictly enforce testing requirements and restrictions, even after it became highly impractical to do so given the contagion of the virus. When Xi finally shifted his rhetoric concerning the policy in late November 2022, partially in response to nationwide protests, local governments quickly competed to shift in the opposite direction and dismantle the controls, even before there was a plan to phase out restrictions and improve access to vaccinations, which could have limited the public health impacts of a debilitating wave of the virus. Instead, the disease spread at rapid rates nationwide in December 2022 and January 2023. The centralization of authority in China meant that no one within the political system could entertain an open policy debate concerning the zero-Covid policy until Xi himself wanted to see it dismantled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the critical questions now facing China’s economy concerns how new structural reforms or changes in China’s strategic priorities can be credibly communicated. While the deleveraging campaign showed how pressure for reform could advance from below and how maintaining a political consensus was difficult but necessary, reformist signals from lower-level officials will not have the same clout in a centralized political system. Unless Xi himself announces a clear intention to make a particular strategic choice, it is difficult for experiments in reform, which had been so central to China’s four decades of “reform and opening,” from gaining momentum and being used as trials for potential nationwide expansion. Changing China’s growth model cannot occur simply based on top-down announcements, as millions of market participants need to believe that the system is changing to be willing to take risks in the economy and in financial markets. After all, a speech from Xi reversing the previous party line on a particular sector could quickly reduce the value of new investments. This is a particularly concerning trend given the rising scrutiny of the financial sector by China’s anticorruption investigators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s centralized political system is less capable of sustaining meaningful economic reforms than in the past, in part because it is difficult for officials to communicate their intentions to reform the system credibly. The deleveraging campaign operated in a far different political context as a sustained effort to reform China’s financial system and generated some meaningful successes along with some unintended consequences. Now a new generation of leadership must make more difficult strategic choices concerning the future direction of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-new-economic-leadership-confronts-complex-strategic-economic-choices&quot;&gt;A New Economic Leadership Confronts Complex Strategic Economic Choices&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the 20th Party Congress and Xi’s reappointment to a third term as the CCP’s general secretary, China appointed new economic leadership, led by a new premier, Li Qiang, and Xi’s confidant He Lifeng as vice-premier in charge of finance and economics. He replaced Liu He, the presumed driving force behind China’s deleveraging campaign and an official with strongly reform-oriented views. However, the leadership of China’s central bank and finance ministry remained in place, suggesting a need for policy continuity and steady hands as difficult choices loom for the economy and financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new set of leading officials confronts complex trade-offs regarding management of the rising risks within the financial system and the structural slowdown of China’s economy. Tactically, several steps can be taken to repair some of the damage from China’s zero-Covid policies. But strategically these choices involve deciding which portions of China’s economy the leadership sees as essential for China’s interests in the future and which are more marginal. All of these choices raise the question of where China will try to direct the economy after the deleveraging campaign shrank the timeline of the previous growth model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the deleveraging campaign, Beijing essentially has four options in attempting to keep its economy operating and its financial system stable. Each involves different trade-offs between economic growth and stability. None of these options assumes that Beijing will launch significant structural reforms of its economy through steps such as breaking up SOE oligopolies or aggressively liberalizing financial markets to crowd in private capital into underserved sectors. These steps could unlock significant gains in productivity and help improve China’s growth potential in the long term after incurring some short-term costs. But they have been promised since 2013, in the early stages of Xi’s administration, with little evidence of progress over the past decade. Reforms have frequently been initiated, only to be quickly reversed after dramatic economic consequences become apparent, in a pattern similar to the interbank market crisis of 2013. This suggests structural reforms have already been attempted, raising obstacles to additional attempts; the assumption of reform cannot be the base case in any set of expectations about China’s future. But without more aggressive structural reforms to unlock growth potential, the option set that Beijing confronts in managing its financial system is far more limited in scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOUBLING DOWN ON DELEVERAGING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic option for Beijing most in line with reform-oriented objectives would be to double down on controlling risks in the financial system. Leaders would conclude that the costs of deleveraging are manageable and that financial risks in the economy are still brewing, requiring relatively strict limits on credit and debt growth to ensure the sustainability of China’s economic expansion in the future. Essentially, this option sees Beijing accepting slower economic growth as inevitable, either because of China’s demographic challenges or because of the weakening property sector. Hence, leaders would decide it is imperative to control rising financial risks now rather than add to them and make the problem even more difficult to manage later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doubling down would involve new restrictions on local government borrowing and SOEs, given that these sectors have effectively circumvented the effects of the deleveraging campaign since 2016. It would also involve new regulations targeting shadow banking activity and continued limits on property sector investment and borrowing by developers. Most notably, the clearest sign of Beijing embarking upon this more reform-oriented choice would be explicitly lower GDP growth targets or abandoning the targets altogether. Given the historical importance of GDP growth targets within China’s system, such a decision would highlight a significant shift in Beijing’s priorities. Based on the government work report unveiled in March 2023, there are some signs that Beijing is attempting to control continued growth in property investment and local government debt. But there are no signs Beijing is abandoning its economic growth targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likely consequences of this set of policies would be a significant slowdown in economic growth. This would reduce the international tension associated with democratic and autocratic systems, as China’s model would likely face its own limits, just as the Soviet economy did in the 1980s. The fact that China’s loss of international influence would be a meaningful consequence makes this strategic option highly unpalatable from Beijing’s perspective. However, China would likely garner some support from financial markets and international policymakers as well, as financial technocrats would appear to be driving economic policymaking once again and responding effectively to China’s long-term challenges by creating the conditions for a more sustainable economy in the future. However, most of the media response to Beijing doubling down on deleveraging would likely be focused on the slowdown in growth, the inevitable costs of the property bubble bursting, and ongoing financial stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAVING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing may be comfortable with slower economic growth in the future but would need to respond more forcefully to the financial risks building at local governments. Right now, these risks are threatening to snowball and produce a fiscal crisis and pressure on the banking system. If Beijing does not respond quickly by reinforcing guarantees for these local governments and related companies, the central government could lose control over fiscal levers to support the economy. Hence, one strategic choice China’s leaders could make would be to explicitly bail out localities and their financing vehicles while maintaining pressure on shadow banks and the property sector. This would combine some elements of the strategy to double down on deleveraging while setting aside certain reform objectives. The rising risks associated with local government finances, including declining land sales revenues and the costs of zero-Covid measures, have increased the urgency of Beijing’s decisionmaking regarding local government debt pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary policies associated with this approach would be an explicit recognition of local government debt and a bailout or fiscalization of local government obligations, shifting them to explicit central government debts. This may also involve some form of monetization of the debt using liquidity provided from the central bank’s balance sheet. As such, there would be a large up-front fiscal cost to such a bailout, as well as the possibility of larger costs in the future, given that the purpose of this fiscalization would be to allow localities to continue investing to maintain a baseline level of infrastructure construction and growth. Presumably, this would be paired with continued pressure on property-related lending and clear overall credit limits to prevent debt from growing out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This option would likely continue to produce weaker economic growth, primarily from the property sector, but infrastructure investment would stabilize, preventing a sharper downturn. Chinese policymakers would generally appear reactive to financial stress rather than proactive in preventing it, given that the problems of local government debt appear intrinsic to China’s political system. Media coverage of China’s economy would probably continue to focus on the problems in China’s property sector rather than on stabilization in infrastructure investment. China’s fiscal space to stimulate the economy would appear constrained due to the required size of the bailout of local governments. But the extent of the slowdown in China’s economy would be debatable, and local government debt would no longer represent an acute risk to the financial system because most of this debt would explicitly be the obligations of the central government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAVING THE PROPERTY SECTOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s leaders may eventually conclude the consequences of a sustained property market downturn are too severe for the party’s base of support among China’s urban middle and upper classes, both politically and economically, and take efforts to reverse their previous crackdown on the sector. In many ways, this process is already underway. But most of what Beijing has attempted to do in supporting the sector so far is to offer new credit lines to developers to complete unfinished houses and to prevent further defaults within the industry that might add to financial stress. This falls short of broader attempts to turn the overall trajectory of the sector around so it can once again represent a driver of economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy options that would be involved in this choice would be relaxing controls on borrowing by property developers and providing other forms of liquidity to developers to prevent defaults on their debts. In addition, both Beijing and local governments would then provide additional incentives for property purchases, likely through lower down payment requirements, lower mortgage rates, reduced taxes on resale of properties, or even subsidies for first-home purchases. Growth targets would likely be maintained in current ranges of around 5 percent, without significant revisions to prepare the political system for slower economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with these policies supporting the property sector, there is no guarantee Beijing will be successful in turning the industry around to once again power the economy. The imbalance between the pace of construction from 2016 to 2021 and fundamental demand among owner-occupiers suggests that China’s property industry needed to contract — and is in the process of doing so. China’s home ownership rates are extremely high, and new entrants to the housing market are declining. Even lower down payment requirements and mortgage rates may not encourage additional housing purchases. And even if sales do stabilize and rebound, developers may simply use the available resources to repair their balance sheets and pay down debt rather than initiate new construction activity. Once the pace of construction declines to a more sustainable level, the sector may contribute to growth cyclically from time to time, depending upon price trends and changes in monetary policy. But structurally it appears unlikely that the property sector can drive the economy forward, even if Beijing provides considerable support for the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers would also appear reactive and would likely lose some credibility because of their rapid reversal in efforts to control the property sector. To a certain extent, this reaction is already unfolding, even if there is more short-term optimism about the economy because of the change of China’s Covid-19 policies. But the overall international reaction would likely remain focused on the fundamental imbalances within China’s economy and the fact that authorities needed to continue relying upon the property sector to maintain growth rather than adjust the growth model more fundamentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OUT OF OPTIONS: BACK TO 2009&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing may also quietly conclude it cannot maintain its deleveraging objectives and its desired rates of economic growth at the same time. Hence, the financial system would need to take on its traditional role as the shock absorber for the real economy and political system, even if that means more financial risks in the future. It appears highly unlikely Beijing would ever formally announce it has reached such a conclusion, given that China’s postcrisis credit expansion was unprecedented in global and historical terms and would be viewed as extremely risky to continue. But this strategic choice would reflect an internal judgment that without strong economic growth, the political consequences for China’s leadership would simply be too severe given the importance of maintaining the internal and external perception of China’s inexorable rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reversal of Beijing’s deleveraging objectives would essentially involve abandoning credit limits and quotas altogether. It would also involve new assistance to local governments, property developers, and home buyers to maintain the previous drivers of the economy. Economic growth targets would be raised back to the 6–7 percent range to encourage local governments to compete against one another to drive additional investment. Capital adequacy ratios for banks may need to be relaxed in order to facilitate additional credit growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response to the abandonment of deleveraging as a strategy would likely be similar to what occurred in March 2020 immediately after the pandemic first hit China. Most companies and local governments would instantly respond to the call to drive growth again, and banks would lend aggressively and roll over loans from state-owned firms and local governments. However, the effect would be very short lived. International media coverage would focus on Beijing’s dramatic about-face and the continued headwinds to China’s economic performance in the long term, particularly given the diminishing returns of credit and investment-led growth. The financial system would likely come under severe stress only a year or two after Beijing makes this choice, given the high levels of nonperforming assets already within the banks and NBFIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEIJING’S BEST OPTIONS FROM HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China faces no easy choices, and all of these options entail some costs. The slowdown in China’s economy is structural in nature, and future growth rates will not resemble those in the past. But there are certain choices that He Lifeng and his new leadership team can take that will at least prepare a foundation for more stable economic growth in the future while minimizing disruptions within the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, credit growth must remain only marginally higher than nominal GDP growth but far below previous rates of credit expansion. Slowing credit growth sharply will have an immediate impact on China’s investment activity and overall economic growth. Enough credit must be provided to prevent widespread financial stress, which could endanger household consumption. But continuing to expand credit in line with previous patterns would only add to debt servicing costs that would weaken investment in the future. China’s financial system has already grown at rates much faster than the real economy over the past two decades, and slowing credit growth is a minimal requirement to reverse those trends in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, local government debt will need to be restructured and, likely, fiscalized. This probably involves guaranteeing the debts of existing LGFVs and replacing them with central government bonds but then either phasing out these companies or reorganizing their funding under central government control. The financing strains upon LGFVs at present could trigger a broader credit crunch and slowdown in the economy if firms are forced to stand on their own without guarantees. Beijing would prefer not to support LGFVs but likely has no choice. Critical decisions will be made after the reorganization and recognition of around 54 trillion yuan ($7.9 trillion), or 45 percent of GDP in local government debt, in order to prevent the problem from growing once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, measures must be taken to use fiscal resources to improve the foundations for household consumption and reduce the household savings rate. This can involve direct fiscal transfers to households from the state, improvements in the social safety network and medical facilities to reduce precautionary savings, reducing taxes or required contribution payments, or other measures to boost the household income share of GDP after transfers. This is a broader structural reform issue rather than specifically related to the deleveraging campaign, but continuing to control credit and investment growth will essentially force household consumption to lead China’s economy forward over the next decade. Providing additional fiscal support to reduce the household savings rate is necessary to prevent a sharp slowdown in overall economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, onshore financial markets must be liberalized further to drive inflows into China’s equity and fixed-income markets. This is necessary to produce a counterbalancing inflow into renminbi-denominated assets to offset the inevitable outflows that will result from the diversification of China’s household and corporate savings into foreign assets. It also makes it easier for China’s central bank to defend the exchange rate during periods in which larger volumes of capital outflows push the currency weaker. Maintaining a stable exchange rate is necessary to incentivize additional inbound investment as well as drive additional consumption-led growth by maintaining China’s overseas purchasing power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these choices on their own or collectively will eliminate threats to China’s financial stability, but together they should place the economy and financial system on a firmer foundation than the present continuously building credit risks. Overall, however, these options are not politically easy for Beijing to execute, particularly involving steps to boost household incomes and consumption, as well as reorganize local government debt. They involve significant admissions that past economic choices have led China toward an unsustainable path and that significant corrections that will slow economic growth are necessary. None of that messaging is consistent with the CCP’s broader propaganda messages that China’s economic rise is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;probable-long-term-outcomes-for-chinas-economy-and-policy&quot;&gt;Probable Long-Term Outcomes for China’s Economy and Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if Beijing makes reasonable decisions to manage financial risks from here, the aftermath of the deleveraging campaign and the end of China’s credit-driven growth model leaves Beijing with a far more limited option set over the next decade. Predicting economic trends remains a perilous exercise, but in the absence of a significant break from China’s current trajectory of slowing credit and investment growth, some outcomes appear more probable than others. Reform trajectories unlocking faster productivity growth rates are still possible but are less probable given the attempted reforms China has already launched and reversed over the past decade. This section discusses the longer-term economic and policy implications from the deleveraging campaign’s effects itself and not necessarily the impacts of slower economic growth. Of course, weaker credit and investment growth will slow the economy as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The slowdown in credit and investment growth will continue.&lt;/strong&gt; China’s deleveraging campaign has created conditions within the financial system that will be very difficult for policymakers to reverse, even if they intend to do so. Specifically, credit growth cannot achieve the same pace as seen in the previous decade and is far more likely to slow to a single-digit pace in the future. China’s financial system is already so large, at 376.7 trillion yuan ($55.3 trillion), in bank assets, that continued expansion at double-digit rates strains both the capacity of the system under current capital requirements and demand from potential borrowers. Credit demand has weakened along with the economy in recent years, particularly from households and the private sector. Risk aversion among lenders exposed to additional credit risks will limit the types of borrowers considered creditworthy. Low rates of return on assets within the banking system will prevent the system from recapitalizing itself out of retained earnings, which will ultimately limit credit and investment growth. In the absence of meaningful structural reforms that could unlock new private sector credit demand, the overall pace of investment growth and GDP growth will slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demand for imported commodities will be weaker.&lt;/strong&gt; In several commodities markets, demand from China’s construction activity has been a critical driver of growth over the past two decades. As one of the most credit-intensive sectors in the economy, the property sector’s medium-term decline means that imports of iron ore, copper, aluminum, base metals, and some refined petroleum products will likely slow. In some cases, lower prices could increase China’s imports of these products because Chinese domestic production costs more. But for most commodities associated with China’s construction activity, the next decade of China’s demand will be much weaker, with the property sector likely to stabilize at around 40–50 percent of the previous decade’s levels of construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest rates for most forms of government and quasi-government borrowing will fall.&lt;/strong&gt; China’s local government debt problem is simply too large at this point to outgrow, given that potential growth in China over the next decade is below the rates seen following the 2007-08 global financial crisis, when China accumulated debt rapidly. As a result, the only effective tool to manage the debt burden is restructuring it at lower interest rates, which will probably involve funding from the central bank’s balance sheet. This also means that policy interest rates from the central bank and critical funding rates will need to decrease over time. In a highly indebted system, there are few options to meaningfully raise interest rates without triggering immediate financial stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s fiscal policy and responsibilities of central and local governments will be restructured.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the probable results of China’s deleveraging campaign will be a change in how China manages its fiscal policies, particularly the balance of responsibilities between central and local governments. Currently, local governments only receive a limited proportion of official tax revenues but have most of the responsibilities for social services spending, particularly for education and medical services. The recent decline in the property market has further pressured local government revenues by weakening land sales revenues, which declined by 24 percent, or around 1.6 trillion yuan ($235 billion), in 2022. The absence of bids in the land market drove localities to pressure LGFVs to buy land from local governments, and LGFVs were involved in 40–45 percent of land purchases in 2022, based on a bottom-up analysis of land auctions. In the long term, Beijing has been attempting to unlock new sources of revenue growth for localities, including the possibility of property taxes. But the decline in the property market makes this far less attractive given the government’s recent attempts to shore up demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging campaign has undercut significant sources of local government revenues via land sales and access to credit through LGFVs. As a result of weakening financing for LGFVs, Beijing is effectively losing control over fiscal policy as an instrument to stabilize the economy. The current model of local government finance is unsustainable, and one of the probable outcomes will be some reform measure rebalancing central and local revenues and responsibilities for social services spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On balance, China’s exchange rate should depreciate in the long term.&lt;/strong&gt; Predicting the movements of exchange rates may appear foolhardy, and any such projections remain speculative given the sheer uncertainty of global financial markets. But the case for a weaker exchange rate is based on the necessity of longer-term declines in interest rates in China, which will both encourage capital outflows from China’s world-leading money supply as well as reduce incentives for capital inflows into a low-interest-rate, low-growth economy. The potential use of the central bank’s balance sheet to stabilize financial conditions concerning local government debt will further incentivize capital outflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limited level of diversification of China’s domestic savings into foreign assets (around 98 percent of China’s deposits are held in renminbi rather than foreign currencies) offers fuel for many years of high levels of capital outflows. While the central bank had $3.13 trillion in foreign exchange reserves as of December 2022, this was only around 8 percent of China’s money supply, the lowest level in at least three decades and lower than levels even during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. As a result, the PBOC will likely be selective in choosing when to intervene to support the currency, particularly if the economy is slowing and exporters could benefit from some currency depreciation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trade surpluses from China and trade deficits in developed economies should continue.&lt;/strong&gt; The probable results of slower economic growth and a weaker exchange rate in China will be stronger exports from China and weaker Chinese imports from the rest of the world. Every meaningful slowdown in China’s investment growth rate has driven an expansion of the trade surplus, affecting both import prices and volumes. The anticipated long-term depreciation in the exchange rate will be driven primarily by changes in capital flows, which means trade flows and the current account will need to balance out those adjustments. Even if China becomes less significant within global supply chains and alternative centers for goods manufacturing emerge, imports may fall by larger margins than exports in response to a weaker exchange rate. China’s household consumption and domestic demand for raw materials will determine levels of imports, which will be pressured by the reduced purchasing power from a weaker exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-us-relationship-with-chinas-financial-system&quot;&gt;The U.S. Relationship with China’s Financial System&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the rise in tensions between the United States and China in recent years, there is an active debate in the United States concerning what type of relationship the country should have with China’s financial system. The stakes of this debate are meaningful, but the U.S. interests involved are not entirely straightforward. Traditionally, the view animating U.S. financial engagement toward China over the past two decades has been that liberalization of China’s financial markets is clearly in U.S. interests. Liberalization increases opportunities for U.S. firms in a rapidly growing economy and introduces competition that would both deepen market forces within China’s financial system and facilitate operating conditions for foreign firms on a more level playing field than they presently enjoy in China. Eventually, state-owned banks, brokerages, insurance companies, and other financial institutions would need to respond to the growing demands of market competition, and foreign financial institutions would likely gain market share over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has made notable efforts toward financial reform over the past decade but has met with limited success, and the immediate market consequences of such reforms have caused Beijing to reverse course and re-establish statist influence and controls. U.S. financial institutions have expanded within China’s financial sector in absolute terms, but relative to expectations and, most importantly, to the size of the Chinese financial system, they have not. Bilaterally, Beijing has been willing to prioritize U.S. financial interests — such as concessions made within the Phase One Agreement — but to the exclusion of key segments (such as payments), and with limits in implementation. Prominent U.S. firms have gained access to new licenses and have expanded ownership stakes of their Chinese joint ventures in some segments of the financial industry. But absent broader structural reforms to the economy, Washington is no longer interested in deals that benefit financial firms disproportionately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key question remains whether or not China’s convergence with international norms, gradual or otherwise, is still possible. If that objective is impossible in the foreseeable future, given the revealed pattern of Chinese refusal to accept concomitant instability during financial transition, and the direction of the Chinese financial system continues moving away from market forces and toward greater levels of state control, then the premises of international engagement with China’s financial system are more suspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This change in China’s reform direction has driven a larger discussion about the costs and benefits of Chinese companies providing equity offerings in the United States. Chinese firms had provided limited disclosures in the past, creating several high-profile cases in which misrepresentations by Chinese companies resulted in losses for U.S. investors. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, passed in 2020, was a congressional response to these concerns. The resulting audits and inspections by the U.S. Public Accounting Oversight Board had reduced the probability of mass delistings of the 262 Chinese firms listed in the United States in September 2022. U.S. investors’ portfolio securities holdings of Chinese firms, including equity and debt holdings and listings in Hong Kong, totaled around $1.2 trillion as of the end of 2020. The valuations of those holdings declined significantly given the slowdown in China’s economy in 2021 and 2022, and the regulatory crackdown on key internet platform companies intensified those losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question now confronting the United States is what changes to U.S. policy priorities are necessary given that state distortions in China’s semi-reformed financial markets are likely to persist. Financial risks in China’s system are likely to increase in the years ahead, and exposing U.S. investors and companies to those risks must be balanced against the potential returns. At the same time, Chinese firms selling securities overseas typically have alternative financing sources within the domestic economy as well. Therefore, reducing U.S. investments in those firms generally does not impact Chinese companies but reduces potential benefits to U.S. investors from higher returns or diversification of their portfolios on a global basis. The logic of pushing for divestment from Chinese securities is primarily political in nature, which is not to downplay its attractiveness in the current climate of U.S.-China relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As detailed earlier, China’s longer-term economic interests will persistently drive the country’s leadership toward further opening China’s capital markets for foreign investment, as these inflows are necessary to counterbalance the inevitable capital outflows that China will face. Even when nationalist or protectionist sentiment appears dominant in China, the priority to encourage foreign inflows into China’s financial system continues reemerging over time. Chinese officials may attempt to maintain access to capital flows without any relaxation of state control necessary for market forces to function, but any significant measures to restrict capital outflows from China will also reduce the potential for inflows into China’s markets. Portfolio flows are not likely to remain contained by Chinese capital controls, as China can slow outflows at times but is unable to stop them completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not meaningful reform within China’s financial system is still possible, Beijing will be forced to speak publicly and act as if market liberalization and reform are still among China’s primary policy objectives. The ideal situation for the United States would be for reformist tendencies to strengthen in China, allowing the case for engagement within a liberalizing Chinese financial system to build political momentum and increase U.S. financial institutions and investors’ exposure to a reforming economy with stronger growth prospects. While that ideal case is highly improbable, there is still a strong argument for maintaining access for U.S. financial investments into China’s equity and fixed-income markets while also tightening and maintaining regulatory controls on the types of Chinese firms that can access capital in U.S. financial markets. The rising risks emerging from China’s financial system at present require U.S. regulators to seek additional disclosures about those risks to level the playing field across U.S. financial markets so that the information Chinese firms provide is equivalent in accuracy and reliability to that of other listed U.S. firms. Many of those steps are already in process and should continue to squeeze any loopholes in disclosure requirements that emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the logic for diversification of global investment portfolios into renminbi-denominated assets is strong as well, given the historically closed nature of China’s capital markets, which means that global investors hold very small proportions of renminbi-denominated assets relative to the size of China’s economy. Global investors continue to beware the risks of direct investments in China’s markets. Geopolitical risks of investments in China have been rising for several years already, and intensified after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, making Beijing’s task far more difficult. But this is Beijing’s own challenge — successfully attracting large volumes of foreign capital likely requires commitments to reform that are currently unpalatable in China and permitting cross-border capital flows that may influence domestic financial stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant degree of financial interdependence between the United States and China will continue, barring a full-blown shift of the present competition to a warlike footing, but the level of that interaction could vary greatly. As China runs a trade surplus with the United States, the dollars earned by Chinese exporters will be recycled into U.S. markets, either via Chinese companies, banks, or the central bank. This was the pattern of engagement through which China’s central bank accumulated large volumes of foreign exchange reserves and purchased U.S. Treasury debt in the 2000s. That pattern has now changed, with Chinese purchases and sales of U.S. securities becoming much more volatile, and private Chinese investors are now acquiring larger volumes of U.S. equities and bonds. Cutting back on U.S. investors’ portfolio inflows into China may narrow the channels of the financial relationship between the two countries but will not eliminate it. The United States is generally better off letting Beijing either succeed or fail in its courtship of foreign investment, rather than supply an easy scapegoat to explain flagging global interest in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Beijing succeeds in attracting sizable foreign inflows, financial interdependence carries its own political logic, and there will be stronger incentives for Chinese authorities to push toward greater market liberalization to prevent rapid capital outflows. At the very least, foreign investors will become more significant players within China’s equity and fixed-income markets with the potential to influence domestic policies and messaging to the markets even within a semi-reformed system. Portfolio flows offer few opportunities for Beijing to use economic interdependence to its political advantage, unlike similar concerns about direct investment and China’s position within global supply chains. The presence of foreign investors offers both a stabilizing source of inflows and a potential threat to stability within China’s financial markets should favorable conditions for investors change. With the added foreign inflows, China’s exchange rate will receive some external support, which will help to avoid ballooning Chinese trade surpluses and U.S. trade deficits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Beijing fails to attract inflows over time, then China has a larger problem on its hands, as existing foreign investors will likely continue shifting money out of Chinese markets. Domestic households and companies will try to diversify into foreign assets, while Beijing continues to tighten controls on those outflows. China’s exchange rate will likely depreciate, which will impact global economic growth and widen China’s external imbalances, forcing adjustments into deficit countries such as the United States. China will appear less influential within the global economy, as the size of its economy and its purchasing power will weaken in U.S. dollar terms. In this circumstance, there will still be large Chinese inflows into U.S. financial markets, but they will be led by private Chinese investors fleeing renminbi-denominated assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political benefits and costs to the United States of these two scenarios are not readily comparable, but it is not in U.S. economic interests to see China’s exchange rate plummet, reducing China’s import levels. This would create a beggar-thy-neighbor effect on other Asian economies (including U.S. allies) and weaken the global economy. Portfolio investments are not direct investments and can shift when market conditions change. (As mentioned previously, fears of restrictions on those outflows will likely mitigate the volume of inflows.) It is also easy to see how U.S. government actions designed to restrict inflows into Chinese markets could be counterproductive and increase those investments from third parties by temporarily depressing prices — exactly what occurred when the U.S. prohibited investments in Chinese firms linked with the military in the waning days of the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulating U.S. financial markets transparently, including Chinese firms’ participation within those markets, is clearly in U.S. interests. Influencing investors’ perceptions of China’s financial markets or patterns of participation within those markets is not. Beijing has its own challenges in attracting foreign inflows given its slowing economy, declining interest rates, opaque policymaking, and stagnant reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;systemic-competition-and-chinas-growth-model&quot;&gt;Systemic Competition and China’s Growth Model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China’s structural economic slowdown continues, this is likely to impact global perceptions of the attractiveness of its economic and political system within the broader context of the ongoing narrative of competition between democratic and autocratic systems. How China responds to rising financial stress will have a meaningful impact on those perceptions as well. In theory, a capable technocratic elite within a one-party state, insulated from domestic political pressures, should be able to manage financial stress very well. China responded to the Asian financial crisis effectively, setting up a Central Financial Work Commission in 1998 under Premier Zhu Rongji’s leadership and orchestrating a significant regulatory overhaul and a restructuring of the entire banking system in the early 2000s. There are current reports that the Central Financial Work Commission could be restarted this year, highlighting the scale of China’s ongoing challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the political imperative of systemic competition and concerns about the global perceptions of China’s economy may prevent China’s financial authorities from taking the necessary steps to ensure systemic stability in the future. Chinese authorities have a number of policy tools in the event of a financial crisis, such as emergency liquidity facilities from the central bank, forced restructuring of distressed commercial banks or other financial institutions, and direct interventions into financial markets to prevent financial contagion. The problem China’s leaders face is that the use of these measures clearly indicates China is facing a financial crisis intrinsic to its growth model and past decisionmaking and reflecting upon the Chinese system as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, financial technocrats are constrained. They have plenty of crisis management tools but may never be able to use them. Using them would suggest a larger problem with China’s economic system and the politics that produced it. Push will never come to shove, as an all-out crisis management effort would suggest China’s economic system is not working. Beijing will attempt to keep the evidence of financial stress secret while quietly deploying tools to manage that stress. But it is difficult to calm financial markets quietly, as financial contagion will cause market participants to look for clear signals of reassurance from policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s deleveraging campaign set events in motion that have ended China’s credit- and investment-led growth model. But grasping the shadow banking system created additional financial risks in the property market and contributed to rising credit risks as implicit guarantees by the state eroded and defaults proliferated. In the future, China’s economic policymaking will be occupied by managing the consequences of the economic and financial conditions produced by the deleveraging campaign while attempting to maintain a narrative that China will still grow in economic and political power and influence. This was a much easier task in the last decade, when China still had years of credit and investment growth ahead. But given demographic pressures, a harsher external political environment, a declining property market, and a financial system that can no longer serve as a shock absorber for the political system, Beijing faces a tough road ahead in a competition of political systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;趙家賢：抗爭派記者會「完全失控」 翌日退岀初選因「無法DQ佢哋唯有DQ自己」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ValtJp9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（6日）踏入審訊第39天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢供稱，在抗爭派記者會後清楚知道要立即退出初選，批會上言論「完全地失控」和「踩界」。控方庭上完整播放記者會片段，抗爭派表示他們已成為主流，重申會堅定否決財政預算案。其中岑敖暉稱立法會議員有權否決每一個法案及議案，並強調如果這樣都是涉嫌顛覆國家的話，「我非常之期待北京或者國安處、或者係林鄭，因為一個議員狂投否決票，而將我哋送入監牢，樂見其成」。這時延伸庭的岑敖暉、黃之鋒及吳敏兒均一同大笑；袁嘉蔚更邊笑邊拍手。在正庭的鄒家成和吳政亨也相視而笑。本案中有32人已還柙至今逾兩年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;抗爭派稱已成主流-岑敖暉指若暴政當道會堅定否決財案若有真普選有磋商空間&quot;&gt;抗爭派稱已成主流 岑敖暉指若「暴政當道」會堅定否決財案、若有真普選有磋商空間&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢今繼續作供。控方庭上播放抗爭派在2020年7月15日舉行的記者會片段，他們於會上發言指抗爭派已成為主流，又強調否決議案是代議士的合法權利，重申他們會否決預算案，並將繼續提倡「議會攬炒」。播放片段時，趙家賢大部分時間微微低頭，間中會抬頭看前方投影的大螢幕或身旁法庭傳譯主任的電腦屏幕，他面前的電腦屏幕則繼續被3張白紙遮蓋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑敖暉首先讀出「抗爭派立法會參選人立場聲明」，表示「初選塵埃落定，抗爭派已成為主流」，並稱：「為咗不負港人期望，民主陣營當務之急，係要團結迎擊北京傀儡政府」。他指北京早已為破壞他們團結設下陷阱，一紙確認書簽署與否成為爭議，但取消資格與否從來不是取決於有否簽署文件。他表示：「我哋一眾抗爭派在此聲明，無論確認書最終會否加入與《國安法》有關內容，我哋都會義無反顧反對《國安法》」，並指會約見泛民主派的初選勝選人，磋商有關簽署的取態。在延伸庭的岑托着頭專心觀看片段，不時微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有記者問到抗爭派進入立法會後，是否會按照承諾否決財政預算案，岑敖暉重申：「我哋係會好堅定行使基本法賦予畀代議士嘅權力，所以答案係是嘅」。他補充：「如果香港係已經落實咗五大訴求，如果係有真普選嘅話，我相信我哋係會有磋商嘅空間，但係如果仍然今日係暴政當道、魔警橫行嘅話…我相信我哋係無論咩內容，都係會否決財政預算案嘅」。此時鄒家成及吳政亨相視而笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑敖暉非常期待國安處因議員狂投否決票而將佢哋送入監牢&quot;&gt;岑敖暉：非常期待國安處因議員狂投否決票，而將佢哋送入監牢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑敖暉回答記者提問時亦指：「一個代議士，一個立法會議員係絕對有權利喺每一個法案、每一個議案、每一個撥款都係投否決，呢一個係喺《基本法》賦予立法會議員非常之清晰嘅權利」，他堅定地強調：「如果咁樣係涉嫌顛覆國家嘅話，我非常之期待北京或者國安處、或者係林鄭，因為一個議員狂投否決票，而將我哋送入監牢，樂見其成」。這時延伸庭的岑敖暉、黃之鋒及吳敏兒均一同大笑；袁嘉蔚更邊笑邊拍手。至於在正庭的鄒家成及吳政亨也相視而笑，林卓廷亦微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑指開記者會目的冀不同路線的分歧完結&quot;&gt;岑指開記者會目的冀不同路線的分歧完結&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑敖暉亦解釋今次召開記者會的核心原因，因在初選當中有不同路線的分歧，是一場「路線之爭」，但今次並非只是民主派的內部選舉，更是面向國際及世界的選舉，但希望有初選結果之後，雙方的分歧可以完結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;梁晃維繼續提倡議會攬炒路線&quot;&gt;梁晃維：繼續提倡議會攬炒路線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在港島區初選勝出的梁晃維則表示，抗爭派會「繼續去阻止極權擴張」，並稱政權今日提倡「議會攬炒就係顛覆國家政權」，但他強調一旦進入立法會，「無論我哋係對政府嘅提案，定係財政預算案去投下反對票，呢一個都係我哋作為代議士嘅一個合法權利」。他明言抗爭派會「繼續提倡議會攬炒路線」，迫使政府向人民低頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑敖暉指抗爭派會與戴耀廷區諾軒趙家賢共同承擔責任&quot;&gt;岑敖暉指抗爭派會與戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢共同承擔責任&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁又表示，選管會稱初選並非立法會選舉的一部分，「政權如果佢真係有任何實質證據，真係能夠攞出任何嘅法律條文，證明今次初選嘅參選人、籌辦人，或者投票嘅市民，係干犯任何法例嘅話，我懇請佢哋立即嚴正執法」。他亦強調作為參選人，「我哋亦都會同今次初選嘅籌辦人共同面對，眼前有機會發生嘅一切困難」。在延伸庭的黃之鋒及岑敖暉不禁竊笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑敖暉於會上亦表示，主辦初選的戴耀廷、區諾軒及民主動力「勞苦功高」。正觀看片段的岑及黃之鋒均微笑。岑續指理解在這階段退出的戰友，他強調今次初選不單是主辦3人的事，「係我哋所有唔同陣營參選人嘅事，更加係我哋60萬選民一齊作出嘅決定」，並表示：「起碼呢度咁多人，一定係會同戴耀廷教授、趙家賢博士以及區諾軒共同承擔嘅責任」。此時鄒家成邊聽邊點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃之鋒指特朗普再簽香港法案-籲北京政府懸崖勒馬&quot;&gt;黃之鋒指特朗普再簽香港法案 籲北京政府「懸崖勒馬」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中有抗爭派提及國際對初選的關注。黃之鋒稱「美國總統特朗普再次簽署有關香港的法案」，他嚴正呼籲北京政府懸崖勒馬，因《國安法》通過是促成國際「圍堵中共」的主因。張崑陽則指，國際社會大肆報導初選，其中路透社更形容初選是「改朝換代」，而美國國務卿蓬佩奧更表態指，港澳辦及中聯辦聲言初選違《國安法》，是恫嚇香港人的表現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，王百羽指，最大公因數是堅決否對財政預算案，如果五大訴求沒有落實的話。這時鄒家成笑着點頭。黃子悅則指本土派與抗爭派在初選中的大捷是屬於「手足」，「我哋唔係暴徒，只係勇於反抗暴政嘅義民」，指議會需要抗爭路上同行的人。衞生服務界的余慧明表示，抗爭派在功能組別中必不可少，批評傳統功能組別只顧自己界別內的選民，而在部份表決投票中「突然變身保皇黨」。她強調功能組別都要面對香港群眾，初選結果亦反映市民唾棄泛民主派，希望更多人會出選挑戰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（6日）踏入審訊第39天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢繼續作供，確認民主動力作為初選承辦機構，為初選進行眾籌、招募、宣傳和為參選人申報開支等。法官陳慶偉問及民主動力在2020年6月宣布眾籌的帖文內，提及「光復議會」和「對抗暴政」的意思，趙指當時民間社會覺得受到「好強大嘅政治打壓」，以「對抗暴政」表達憤慨，並在法官追問下指相信「暴政」是指當時的香港政府。被問該些字眼是否民主動力的政治立場，趙稱「絕對不是」，並說「抱歉法官閣下，我要認錯」，「我冇做好謹慎責任嘅角色」，有被告說「嘩」，多人發笑。趙在追問下指民主動力並非「政治中立」，是屬民主陣營的組織。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認民主動力為初選眾籌340多萬招募逾2500義工&quot;&gt;趙確認民主動力為初選眾籌340多萬、招募逾2,500義工&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢繼續作供。控方展示民主動力6月9日的Facebook帖文，以「2020年立法會選舉-民主派35+公民投票及眾籌行動」為題，提及為初選進行眾籌和招募，目標金額350萬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢確認民主動力為了初選和該會的經費而進行眾籌，並指當時戴耀廷計算過約需300至400萬開支，並在6月9日記者會上指需400萬，而趙為了讓關注人士較容易記得「35+」的目標，故將金額調低至350萬，最終籌得340多萬元。趙又指就相關眾籌，「我哋都特別由我提出，係根據返選舉事務處嘅選舉指引嘅精神」，呼籲捐贈1,000元或以下的「小額眾籌」，他們最後亦將多於1,000元的款項排除在初選的開支經費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就招募的人員數目，趙指各區有區議員、社區主任和義工等協助，但沒有仔細問總幹事，不能確切回答，但指共有250多個票站，各票站有站長和核心義工，另有一些義工協助排隊、維持秩序和宣傳，每個票站約有10人，大致上共有逾2,500人。法官陳仲衡問工作人員有否報酬，趙指民主動力秘書處就此項目聘請的兼職會有報酬，而各票站義工吃飯、食水、電芯等物資，會先由該票站站長先墊支，再向民主動力報銷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認民主動力為參選人申報開支於蘋果日報等媒體賣廣告宣傳初選&quot;&gt;趙確認民主動力為參選人申報開支、於《蘋果日報》等媒體賣廣告宣傳初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪續要求趙總結民主動力在初選的工作，趙重申民主動力因戴耀廷和區諾軒的邀請，而「承辦咗初選呢個活動項目」，「我哋係初選呢個活動嘅承辦機構」。而就此「活動項目」，民主動力向公眾進行眾籌收集資金開展活動，亦是所有初選參選人的「選舉服務提供者」，民主動力會就提供過的服務以選舉捐贈的形式給予所有參選人，為他們填寫和遞交選舉開支申報書，以附合選舉法例。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙亦確認，民主動力負責準備和收集提名表格，並在Facebook帖文發布連結供人下載。民主動力亦有參與宣傳，呼籲市民參與7月11及12日的投票，趙指作為承辦機構有責任讓公眾認知其承辦項目，確認他曾指示秘書處在傳統紙媒及網媒賣廣告，舉例《蘋果日報》手機應用程式內亦有初選的電子廣告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問民主動力帖文光復議會對抗暴政意思-趙一度指不同人有不同解讀&quot;&gt;官問民主動力帖文「光復議會」、「對抗暴政」意思 趙一度指不同人有不同解讀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後主動就帖文內容發問，趙確認帖文中提及眾籌和招募義工均是民主動力的工作，指他們承辦活動時的分工，「呢啲人力資源嘅安排都係我哋去做統籌」；又確認帖文多數由總幹事草擬，他就大項目會審視並進行修訂，再作發布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;帖文中提及「#團結一致 #立會過半 #光復議會 #對抗暴政 #711及712投票 #民主派 #35plus #公民投票」。陳慶偉問及，「#光復議會」的意思是什麼？趙望住螢幕思考數秒指，「喺我嘅理解係立法會過咗一半，民主派就能夠將議會個功能能夠光復到，就實行到民主派一啲嘅政策倡議」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問文中有「#對抗暴政」，「你是指哪個暴政？」，趙沒有正面回答，僅指「當時嘅社會環境底下，支持民主嘅民間社會，覺得係受到好強大嘅政治打壓，而對抗暴政嘅意思都係表達緊呢種憤慨」，並指「當然係講緊現有政權」。陳追問，是現有的香港政府抑或中國政府？抑或兩者皆是？趙指「我只可以講，唔同人睇到呢個字眼會按佢自己嘅思維有不同嘅解讀」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱對抗暴政等絕對不是民動立場-向法官認錯指無做好謹慎責任角色&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱「對抗暴政」等絕對不是民動立場 向法官認錯指無做好謹慎責任角色&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指着電腦螢幕：「你的Facebook專頁，你告訴我」，趙再答「我相信係講緊當時嘅香港政府」。陳問，這是否也是當時民主動力的政治立場？趙答：「回應法官閣下，我作為召集人，我要講嘅係絕對不是」，陳續問若然如此，為何會有該些字眼？此時趙說：「抱歉法官閣下，我要認錯」，有被告大聲說「嘩」，鄒家成、何桂藍等多人發笑。趙續說：「我冇做好謹慎責任嘅角色，原因係職員草擬咗比我嘅時候，我着重睇嘅位置，當時冇特別留意到呢個位」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續問，那民主動力是否沒有政治立場、是政治中立，只是作為承辦人（contractor）的角色？趙指他們當然是承辦人，「但我哋當然亦都係作為傳統民主派嘅一個協調組織，同埋一個協作交流嘅平台，所以我唔可以話係政治中立，因為民主動力本身都係一個喺民主陣營裡面嘅組織」。陳續問，故因此帖文該部分是一個完全的錯誤？趙指，若當時有做好謹慎責任，在該句便不會加入「#光復議會 #對抗暴政」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙家賢上周稱雙眼看眼前電腦螢幕較「辛苦」，法庭終以3張白紙遮蓋他面前電腦螢幕。趙的電腦今續被白紙遮蓋，趙作供時大部分時間望向身旁傳譯主任的電腦螢幕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（6日）踏入審訊第39天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢繼續作供，提及兩辦譴責初選或違法後，戴耀廷嘗試「力挽狂瀾」將各人拉回紅線內，惟抗爭派卻在沒有知會大會下，召開記者會表明否決預算案、望引致國際制裁，是「完全地失控」、「踩界」和抵觸《國安法》，令他覺得要立即退出初選。趙又指，民主動力在提名表格加入承諾擁護《基本法》及效忠特區的條款，因知道這是民選公職人員「應有之義」，惟抗爭派言論絕對不合乎該條款；而趙只是「服務提供者」，非如選委會般有實權，「我唔能夠DQ佢哋嘅話，我唯有喺呢個時候DQ自己」，「比公眾傳媒好清楚認知係一個切割」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙家賢透露民主動力原定會委託香港民研進行選前民調，惟因已退出初選，故沒有繼續。他並透露，眾籌所得的大額款項部分納為民主動力經費，而戴耀廷曾表示望預留80至100萬元予香港民研研發新的民間投票系統，民主動力並將剩餘資金捐予香港民研和慈善機構。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指區諾軒致電稱將退出初選-並指趙要自行解散&quot;&gt;趙指區諾軒致電稱將退出初選 並指趙要自行解散&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今就趙家賢退出初選的情況發問。趙家賢表示，區諾軒在7月14日曾致電他指「佢自己將會退出初選，而佢都想我一齊退出」，並指已聯絡時任政制及內地事務局政治助理吳璟儁；而由於建制派傳媒、中央駐港機構、及國務院均大肆抨擊初選涉違《國安法》，區表示根據其判斷及獲得的意見，是需要將初選停止。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指他當時問區，「初選都做咗出嚟、已經投咗票，我哋有啲咩補救措施、remedies可以做呢？」，區指唯有作為主辦機構的他，及作為承辦機構的民主動力，「要自行解散（初選）」，亦表示自己將於7月15日宣布退出，趙則稱待區退出後，民主動力會一同退出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱退出初選因事情已由本地政治層面提升到國家層面&quot;&gt;趙稱退出初選因事情已由本地政治層面提升到國家層面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢其後於7月16日在Facebook發出「初選完成：退出參與協調工作聲明」，表示：「本人擔任召集人的民主動力獲主導民主派協調工作的戴耀廷副教授及區諾軒前議員委託承辦『民主派35+公民投票（初選）』，最終結果已公布，本人的協作角色已告完成。經慎重考慮各方意見，為對身邊人士、民主動力執委會及所屬組織等負責，本人現宣佈退出參與本屆立法會選舉的協調工作。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問趙為何退出，趙表示於7月13日晚得知戴耀廷對初選是否完全合法開始有疑問，而翌日《蘋果日報》政治版資深記者提醒他戴〈真攬炒十步〉一文並著他小心，區諾軒亦表示會退出「35+」，再加上建制陣營與中央政府對初選的看法，趙強調：「我會睇到個事情已經係由香港本地政治層面，提升到去國家嘅層面」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴耀廷力挽狂瀾望初選免踩紅線-惟抗爭派召記者會完全失控&quot;&gt;趙稱戴耀廷力挽狂瀾望初選免踩紅線 惟抗爭派召記者會「完全失控」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，7月14日戴耀廷曾向所有參選人發訊息稱「不提否決每一個議案，也不說癱瘓政府」，趙認為此舉除了是統一口徑外，「佢（戴耀廷）都可以講係力挽狂瀾，希望將初選拉返唔好踩到呢個紅線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過，他指縱使本土抗爭派收到戴的訊息，仍然在「冇同我哋大會有任何溝通嘅時候」，自行於7月15日召開抗爭派記者會，「佢哋不單止無視咗戴耀廷7月14號統一口徑嘅短訊，更加係重複好重視除咗會否決財政預算案，仲會係所有議案都會否決」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指事前沒有收到通知會有該記者會，強調該記者會與民主動力「完全冇任何嘅關係」。趙認為，抗爭派的發言是希望迫使政府考慮DQ議員和解散立法會，「從而係去到國際層面令到國際關注，而去制裁中央政府」，並加重語氣指：「整件事係完全地失控！」，鄒家成和在延伸庭的黃之鋒聞後不禁發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指抗爭派發言與國安法踩界-他無權dq他們唯有dq自己&quot;&gt;趙指抗爭派發言與《國安法》踩界 他無權DQ他們「唯有DQ自己」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，他特別在民主動力準備的提名表格上，加上參選人要承諾擁護《基本法》及效忠香港特別行政區的條款，明言「呢個係我哋民主動力好清楚知道，擔任民選公職人員嘅應有之義」，黃之鋒再次發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟趙指，抗爭派的發言「絕對不合乎」上述條款，「喺我嘅角度，絕對係同《國安法》係踩界㗎喇！」但他無奈表示，初選只是民間選舉，「我唔係真係好似時任選委會主席同法官咁有個實權」，再加上他只是一個「服務提供者」，「我唔能夠DQ佢哋嘅話，我唯有喺呢個時候DQ自己」，鄒家成發笑，在延伸庭的被告聞後亦大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱原定初選投票後委託香港民研做民意調查-同意民調屬35計劃重要部分&quot;&gt;趙稱原定初選投票後委託香港民研做民意調查 同意民調屬「35+計劃」重要部分&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續解釋，若選舉繼續正常進行，初選後原定有一些協調工作要處理，包括由區諾軒及戴耀廷兩位協調人負責協調勝出參選人的出選名單；而官方投票前的一星期，原定由民主動力委託香港民意研究所進行選前民意調查。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;但趙指，由於區諾軒致電他時提及《國安法》第33條（自動放棄犯罪可減刑的條文），並建議他終止計劃，加上初選結果已公布，「喺呢方面都冇得去做任何補救措施，咁所以我只可以公開簡單講，話個協作角色已經完成啦」。法官陳仲衡問到，事實上民主動力仍有工作要做？趙回應：「喺正常情況底下，根據當時計劃，係仲有嘢要做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問到，若趙家賢沒有退出協調工作，香港民研的民意調查是否「35+計劃」一個重要而不可少（integral）的部分？趙同意，指以往選前民調只是以滾動形式讓市民每周得知支持度趨勢，而是次民調計劃在選前一星期公布結果，部分選區會視乎支持度來決定最後出選名單，亦可按形勢「指示」各區如何分配選票，形容「有一定作用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱退出後無付錢予民研做民調-部分眾籌資金作為民動經費部分捐民研及慈善機構&quot;&gt;趙稱退出後無付錢予民研做民調 部分眾籌資金作為民動經費、部分捐民研及慈善機構&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷在趙退出後同日，亦發文宣布「因過去幾個月的勞累，我希望在未來的一段日子，爭取多一些休息時間，也可以更專注於學術的工作。當然，我不是甚麼也不再做，我必會與所有認同民主普選的香港人走在一起，在各自的位置，為達成這目標，繼續努力，直至民主普選臨到香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙表示，戴發文前他「完全冇收到任何訊息」，當日亦沒有與戴討論其帖文或「35+計劃」。但趙記得之後約一星期，戴有問他是否仍會付錢予香港民研鍾庭耀進行選前民調，趙回應「我哋民主動力已經退出，就唔想繼續之後嘅事情，所以就冇畀錢」。趙續指，戴在官方選舉提名期結束、宣布延期前，亦曾向他發訊息指香港民研或會另外找資源做有關民意調查，至於之後民研會否有就「35+」的工作，趙沒有仔細問下去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問眾籌資金有何去向，趙表示每個細項少於1,000元的資金才會撥入初選開支，其餘則會視作捐予民主動力的會務經費，及支持民意調查的資金。趙指，戴耀廷曾提及望撥出80至100萬予香港民研，指民主派對反對預算案有顧慮，望能研發新的民間投票系統。趙在其後執委會會議上，建議將餘下資金部分捐予香港民研用作民意調查，但沒指定某一項目；至於其他資金則再捐助予一些根據《稅務條例》88條註冊的慈善機構。趙指於2020年8月底至9月捐款予民研。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡亦問到，趙的帖文兩度使用「本人」一詞，他是否以個人名義、而非民主動力的名義退出？趙指根據民主動力執委會的章程，他作為召集人，「係整體領導成個組織嘅工作」，早前執委會亦清楚他代表民主動力承辦整個初選的工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙原打算區諾軒退出後視乎情況決定何時退出-惟抗爭派記者會後思維轉變要清楚切割&quot;&gt;趙原打算區諾軒退出後視乎情況決定何時退出 惟抗爭派記者會後思維轉變要清楚「切割」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰其後主動提及，趙宣布退出協調工作的前一日，曾轉發區諾軒宣布退出的帖文，並提到「在恐懼瀰漫的氛圍，會謹守崗位，堅持合法實務工作」。李問趙前一日已知道區諾軒會退出，但似乎他在15日仍希望繼續初選工作，那為何到了16日又宣布退出？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙解釋，7月14日與區諾軒通話時，「當時我哋傾好係佢首先退出，而我會再睇住個事情，睇吓邊個位合適而作出退出」，並指因始終有行政工作要處理，而平時就初選的論述和回應傳媒，均是由計劃的「倡導、領導者」戴耀廷處理，故當時認為可以「再睇幾日」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，其思維「好特別嘅轉變」，就是在7月15日「完全冇認知、冇提示」下，本土抗爭派召開記者會，重申他們的發言絕對不合乎擁護《基本法》和效忠特區的條款。趙再強調，「整件事已經係完全失控」，指他們「仲要係以初選勝出者去講明，會好貫徹地就住戴耀廷協調嘅共識，去繼續行落去同參選」。趙強調，他作為民主動力召集人，「我對我嘅組織同埋身邊嘅同事等等係要負責」，「咁我只可以喺當時就係好清楚嘅要退出之後嘅工作，畀公眾傳媒好清楚認知係一個切割」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱作為有恆常思維的人-認為抗爭派提及的行動會抵觸國安法故退出初選&quot;&gt;趙稱作為有「恆常思維」的人 認為抗爭派提及的行動會抵觸《國安法》故退出初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉提議應觀看趙家賢提及的抗爭派記者會片段，李運騰亦指望了解會上各人實際說過的話。控方下午播放長約1小時的抗爭派記者會片段，播畢後主控萬德豪問趙家賢，記者會與他指「思維轉變」有否關係。趙指「有好重要嘅關係」，指看到記者會直播「就令到我會覺得係即刻要去退出（初選）」，並指退出聲明其實於15日晚已準備好，但他曾與一些團體討論過「出Facebook最有利嘅時候，就係朝頭早11點左右」，故最終於翌日該時段發帖。在延伸庭的袁嘉蔚及黃之鋒不禁竊笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉打斷指控方問題是記者會上有什麼令趙改變心意。趙續表示，記者會上抗爭派曾表達抗爭派已成為主流，會將抗爭意志繼續帶入議會進行「攬炒」，進行肢體衝突或對議案投下否決票；亦提及政府可能會DQ本土派候選人或立法會議員，他們會否決預算案迫使特首解散立會。趙續指，會上提及國際社會留意到事態發展就會「圍堵中共」，亦提及美國有簽署法案制裁中國與香港的官員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙再次強調，聽到記者會內容時「好確知」抗爭派聲稱的行動並非能捍衞基本法和效忠特區的「心意」，亦認為他們提到的流程會抵觸《國安法》。趙補充他當然並非法律學者或有關方面的律師專家，只是作為有「恆常思維」的人士、一個「合理的人（reasonable man）」而有上述看法，並認為代表民主動力籌辦初選，一定要對組織和身邊人負責，故當時「好清楚知道要即刻係去退出（初選）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴曾提及國安法生效後參與者言行或對計劃產生影響-指有人有啲過咗界&quot;&gt;趙稱戴曾提及《國安法》生效後參與者言行或對計劃產生影響 指有人「有啲過咗界」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙又補充，區諾軒曾向他提及《國安法》第33條要用方法終止初選計劃，而他在抗爭派記者會前一日，亦意識到初選協調整個「活動項目」已變成戴耀廷「攬炒十步」的一部分。趙續指，戴7月14日發訊息「諗住力挽狂瀾將大家嘅言行統一」、「將大家由踩到紅線拉返出嚟嘅時候」，抗爭派卻「清楚講明我哋而家喺紅線裡面呀」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，趙不止一次稱戴想把大家從紅線拉出來，是戴親口告訴他，抑或趙猜測戴的意圖？趙指戴發訊息當日，二人曾以電話聯絡，戴提及當時有候選人的言論「已經有啲過咗界」，《文匯》、《大公》等建制媒體亦有報導。趙指戴當時認為普通法沒有追溯力，故不認為他以往的文章有問題；但《國安法》生效後，所有初選參與者的言行便可能對整個計劃有不同程度的影響，故戴望發訊息做到「統一口徑」，趙並意識到戴「其實想將整件事係由踩到界拉返出嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在法官追問下確認，《國安法》前戴耀廷均稱「35+計劃」合法，直至7月13日晚趙首次聽到戴不確定初選是否違法。李續問，趙看到抗爭派記者會後感到憂慮，有否與戴耀廷討論會上內容？趙指沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問確認書意思-趙稱屬行政措施最終由選舉主任決定能否入閘&quot;&gt;官問「確認書」意思 趙稱屬行政措施、最終由選舉主任決定能否入閘&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，李運騰亦指記者會上屢聽到抗爭派被問及會否簽「確認書」，問「確認書」是什麼。趙指現行選舉法例沒有列明要簽署確認書，確認書應是在2019年區議會選舉始出現，並將法例要求候選人作出聲明的條款，如列出某些《基本法》條文，要求獲提名人士再次確認簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指初選提名表格並不包括確認書內容，因已參考官方選舉表格，而擁護《基本法》條款亦包含所有《基本法》條文和附件；而抗爭派當時是關注確認書會否要求擁護《國安法》。趙並指，2019年區選時有候選人沒有簽確認書但能入閘，有候選人有簽但不能入閘，故確認書只是「行政措施」，「最終都應該係由個選舉主任決定嗰個人係能唔能夠入閘」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周二（11日）續審。臨散庭前，控方表示已就其中一名控方證人申請匿名令，若辯方有反對望於下周三前提出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-post-post-cold-war-era&quot;&gt;The Post-Post-Cold War Era&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among its other effects, Vladimir Putin’s second war of aggression against Ukraine is accelerating the division of the world into opposing geopolitical, economic, and ideological blocs. Russia’s unprovoked brutality and disastrous military incompetence have further deepened its isolation from advanced industrial democracies, strengthening the bonds among them while driving Moscow into an ever-deepening dependence on Beijing. The shock of invasion has resulted in an expansion of NATO’s ranks, bolstering its northern flank and galvanizing unprecedented transatlantic security cooperation. Meanwhile, Xi Jinping’s refusal to condemn the actions of his “best and bosom friend,” and the fact that the war began only days after he and Putin proclaimed their “no limits” partnership, has heightened suspicions about Beijing’s intentions in European capitals, fueling demands in some quarters for a thorough reexamination of every aspect of policy toward China. The terrible spectacle of an enormously destructive war in the heart of Europe has also raised the perceived probability of a similar conflict in the Indo-Pacific, highlighting the need for closer strategic cooperation among the United States and its democratic allies in both regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time as they intensify divisions between East and West, recent events have raised questions about future patterns of alignment between the North and the Global South. The United States and its allies have cast their support for Ukraine as upholding the norm of sovereignty and opposing the law of the jungle by defending the weak against the depredations of the strong. Yet many governments in the developing world clearly do not view the conflict in the same light and, in any event, have been reluctant to join the West in denouncing Russian aggression. This has led some observers to predict the emergence of a new nonaligned movement, while others warn that Moscow and Beijing have stolen a march on the advanced democracies, outflanking them by winning support across the non-Western world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its recently released National Security Strategy, the Biden administration declared that “the post-Cold War Era is definitively over.” While its precise features remain to be determined, this new “post-post-Cold War” epoch already bears a striking resemblance to the early years of the superpower rivalry that followed the end of World War II. Now, as then, a pair of continental authoritarian giants are facing off against a coalition made up largely of democracies arrayed around the periphery of Eurasia and backed from across the oceans by the United States. And, as was true in the second half of the twentieth century, the two blocs have begun to compete for followers, access, and influence in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-axis-of-authoritarians&quot;&gt;An “Axis of Authoritarians”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite three decades of steadily tightening ties, skeptics continue to question the depth and durability of the connections between Moscow and Beijing. Since the start of Russia’s renewed war in Ukraine, some have suggested that the Sino-Russian partnership might be approaching a “turning point,” with Xi looking to distance himself from Putin’s misadventures and perhaps even open to the possibility of “recalibrating” relations with Russia. As has happened repeatedly in the past, however, such predictions are likely to be disproven by events. Indeed, as David Shullman and Andrea Kendall-Taylor have argued, it now seems clear that, instead of driving them apart, the war in Ukraine will end up drawing Russia and China even closer together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notion that the links between the two Eurasian giants comprise a fragile “axis of convenience,” and that theirs is nothing more than “a classic great power relationship driven by common interests rather than shared values,” is misleading on several counts. Throughout history, most geopolitical partnerships have in fact been built largely if not entirely on shared interests; what matters is how strong and enduring this commonality proves to be. In the case of Russia and China, the alignment of material interests has only grown stronger with the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since early in the post-Cold War period, both Moscow and Beijing have believed that they face a common geopolitical foe: an arrogant and overbearing American hegemon which, together with its regional allies, is determined to block their revisionist territorial ambitions and deny them a sphere of influence commensurate with their power. Over the course of the past decade, as they have sought more openly to push back against what they regard as U.S.-led containment, Xi and Putin have helped to create a self-fulfilling prophecy. Even before the latest crisis, China’s increasingly forceful attempts to assert its maritime claims, and Russia’s aggression against Georgia and then Ukraine, were beginning to galvanize precisely the sort of collective opposition that both Moscow and Beijing have long said they fear. Recent events will only serve to accelerate this cycle, stiffening democratic resistance, thereby further heightening the authoritarians’ perceptions of threat and tightening ties between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to shared strategic concerns, Russia and China have also been drawn together by the needs of their respective economies. China’s rapid development has given it an enormous appetite for minerals, cereals, and energy resources, all of which Russia has supplied in increasing quantities since the end of the Cold War. Especially since its first invasion of Ukraine, in 2014, the imposition and strengthening of sanctions has caused Russia to turn increasingly to China as an alternative to Western markets, capital, and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the interests they share are strong, it would be a mistake to understate the commonality of values and outlook that also binds the authoritarian powers together. During the Cold War, the People’s Republic and the Soviet Union ostensibly shared a commitment to Marxism-Leninism, but they soon fell out over how to interpret and apply that supposedly scientific and infallible doctrine. Russia and China may not be united today by a common ideology, but neither are they divided by one; instead, they share an intense animosity to the ideals and governing principles being propounded by liberal democracies. What Beijing refers to as the West’s “so-called universal values” — including an insistence on the sanctity of the individual, the defense of personal freedoms, the right to self-government, and the rule of law — are inimical to the precepts on which both the Russian and Chinese regimes are founded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter this threat to their legitimacy, both Moscow and Beijing have crafted alternative ideational programs that contain varying blends of authoritarianism, statism, and nationalism as well as appeals to history, “traditional values,” and cultural conservatism. These programs are not identical, but they are clearly compatible and, in any event, are far more similar to one another than either is to liberalism. Like Hitler and Mussolini, Xi and Putin represent different species of the same anti-democratic, illiberal genus. The fact that the United States is now casting its opposition to them in ideological terms, as part of a global struggle between democracy and authoritarianism, will only confirm what they already believed to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the post-Cold War era, the authoritarian great powers have been following very different trajectories, with China gaining rapidly in wealth and power and Russia experiencing a sustained and painful decline. To the surprise of many observers, this reversal of fortunes has not given rise to ever-growing friction over tangible issues or even to much open resentment in Russia about its comparative loss of status. For the most part, Moscow and Beijing have found ways to work together rather than at cross purposes, dividing the labor where their activities overlap or simply staying out of one another’s way. Chinese policymakers have generally taken care to avoid behaving in a humiliating or high-handed fashion, while their Russian counterparts have had little choice but to accept their own diminished position. Moscow’s increasing isolation after the imposition of harsh sanctions in 2014, and the devastating additional blow that has now been inflicted to its power and prestige, will hasten its relative decline, further narrowing its freedom of maneuver, diminishing its leverage, and compelling it to follow Beijing’s lead even more closely than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One further source of skepticism about Sino-Russian cohesion is the belief that, because of their divergent paths, the two authoritarian powers must have very different time horizons and strategic objectives. In this view, Russia is a weak and fading “disruptive power” whose only option for preserving its position is to undermine others by promoting instability. On the other hand, confidence in its own rise supposedly allows China to take a more relaxed and incremental approach, advancing patiently toward global leadership while remaining within the confines of the existing international system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hal Brands and Michael Beckley have recently argued to the contrary that, as growth slows and external resistance mounts, Beijing’s assessments of its own prospects will become more pessimistic and its behavior more belligerent. If this happens, the democracies could find themselves confronted by two highly aggressive authoritarian enemies at once, each willing to take major risks to achieve its aims and perhaps coordinating their actions at opposite ends of the Eurasian landmass. At least for the moment, however, there is no indication that Xi Jinping has lost faith in the ultimate triumph of the nation and the system that he leads, or that he is anywhere close to contemplating a desperate gamble to stave off terminal decline. In fact, Beijing may now believe that Russian belligerence can help it to execute its comparatively cautious strategy for gaining regional preponderance by deflecting some of the resources and attention of the United States and its allies away from Asia to Europe. This is what occurred in 2014, when the first Ukraine war helped to derail the Obama administration’s proposed “pivot” to Asia. Depending on how events play out, something similar could happen again today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that it does not suffer political collapse and regime change, an authoritarian Russia will emerge from the current conflict even weaker, more alone, and more deeply dependent on China than it was when the war began. Alexander Gabuev has even gone so far as to claim that Moscow is being transformed into “China’s new vassal.” In certain respects, the shifts will be in matters of degree rather than in kind. Cut off from other markets, Russia will have to sell yet more natural resources at still lower prices to China, often accepting renminbi in payment and using them to buy more Chinese consumer products, machine tools, semiconductors, and other manufactured goods of the sort that can no longer be obtained from Europe. Moscow’s isolation will also compel it to become an even more avid and dependable supporter of Beijing’s positions in international institutions and to accept a further expansion in China’s presence and influence in Central Asia relative to its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the war, Russia may also have to accede to demands that will have implications for the balance of military power in the Indo-Pacific, including agreeing to sell or transfer even its most advanced weapons systems to China, and perhaps cutting back arms sales to two of China’s nonaligned regional enemies, India and Vietnam. Although any understandings would likely be tacit rather than explicit, Beijing may also make clear that, in return for its continuing support, it expects Moscow to take diversionary action in Europe should it ever decide to move against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to his bungled war of aggression, Putin has no choice but to cling as tightly as possible to his partner and patron. Xi surely has greater freedom of maneuver, but given his dark assessment of Western intentions, his options with respect to Russia are also quite limited. As Shullman and Kendall-Taylor explain, Xi cannot permit Putin to be isolated, defeated, and humiliated by a U.S.-led coalition to the point where the Russian leader might actually be overthrown. In addition to setting a very dangerous precedent, such an outcome would effectively remove Moscow as a useful counterweight to the menacing collective power of the United States and its allies. Should they succeed in neutralizing Russia, the democracies would then be free to turn their full attention to encircling and containing China. Xi’s oft-expressed desire to reduce the efficacy of Western economic pressure, and his evident conviction that the risks of confrontation and war are rising, makes it even more important to secure China’s rear areas. Expanded overland flows of oil, gas, and grain can help it to hedge against the possibility of a U.S. naval blockade. Seen in this light, more cheap and reliably accessible Russian resources are not merely a bargain but a crucial lifeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s dismal prospects may mean that, in the long run, China will find itself “shackled to a corpse.” Even in the relatively near term, a shattered and defeated nation that still rejects the West and seeks Beijing’s protection could become a major liability. For the time being, however, Russia remains an indispensable partner. Beijing has expressed mild disapproval at Putin’s egregious conduct, and it has taken care thus far to avoid crossing lines that might trigger secondary sanctions from the United States and European Union. But Xi has also continued to provide diplomatic cover and economic support to help keep Russia (and Putin) afloat. A decision to go further, openly supplying Moscow with weapons and other military systems, would mark a major departure that could trigger an escalating cycle of sanctions and counter-sanctions between China and the West. Because of the likely costs and risks, Xi will probably take such a step only if he fears that Russia is on the verge of outright defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Xi’s perspective, the ideal outcome would be a return to some version of the status quo ante: a frozen conflict in which fundamental issues remain unresolved and the combatants are still at swords’ point, only now with greatly heightened animosity, tension, and the lingering threat of direct conflict between Russia and the West. Such a situation would give Russia the chance to begin to rebuild its strength, drawing it deeper into China’s embrace while at the same time continuing to distract the United States from the Indo-Pacific. If it can present itself plausibly as a peacemaker and honest broker, Beijing may even be able to regain some of its lost leverage in European capitals, perhaps enabling it to get back to the business of driving wedges between Washington and its Atlantic allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-coalition-of-democracies&quot;&gt;A Coalition of Democracies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was true during much of the Cold War, the world’s major democracies can be thought of as comprising a triangle. The United States stands at the apex, embedded in a multilateral alliance system with Europe and linked by a network of bilateral commitments to its various partners in Asia. While they are not joined together by a trans-regional mutual defense pact, European and Asian democracies nevertheless engage in various forms of intelligence sharing, joint technology development, and strategic dialogue. Thanks in part to recent events, the three vertices of this triangle have all grown stronger and more cohesive. Albeit to varying degrees, so too have the ties between each of them. Beyond the purely military realm, Europe, Asia, and the United States have also begun to move closer in their economic policies toward Russia and China and in their emphasis on the shared values that unite them and separate them from their authoritarian rivals. Whether these trends will prove enduring, resulting in a fully reconstituted, global “free world” coalition, remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-states-and-asia&quot;&gt;The United States and Asia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well before the current crisis, China’s increasing strength and its growing belligerence had begun to produce a stepped-up counterbalancing response on the part of its wealthiest and most capable neighbors. Albeit belatedly, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, and India have all undertaken major increases in defense spending in the past half-decade. Concerns over China’s growing capabilities and opaque intentions have also led to intensified consultation and cooperation, both bilaterally with the United States and in various multilateral groupings, outside the context of formal alliance commitments. First launched in 2007 and revitalized in 2017, the Quad has become a regular mechanism for promoting closer and more regular strategic coordination among Japan, Australia, the United States, and India. Starting in 2021, the United States and the United Kingdom announced their intention to cooperate to help Australia build a nuclear-powered submarine as well as to work together to develop artificial intelligence, quantum computing, hypersonic weapons, and autonomous undersea vehicles. After years of recrimination and tension, Japan and South Korea have also taken steps to normalize their relations with one another and, together with the United States, to resume regular trilateral strategic dialogue and expand military cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that they involve different actors and are taking place half a world away, events in Ukraine have given an additional impetus to all these efforts. Whether or not there has truly been an increase in the probability of war, the shocking reality of a major conflagration in the heart of Europe has increased the perceived likelihood of similar events occurring in the Indo-Pacific. Putin’s unexpected, self-destructive, and arguably irrational decision to use force to absorb another polity has highlighted the danger that autocracies led by unchecked dictators may be prone to disastrous mistakes. China’s refusal to join the democracies in denouncing Russian aggression has also fueled more specific concerns about its own intentions and ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perceptions and possible parallels aside, in the past year Beijing has further intensified its ongoing campaign of pressure against Taipei, including an August 2022 military exercise of unprecedented scope in the water and airspace around the island. At the same time, the demonstrated effectiveness of precision munitions, information operations, and flexible small-unit tactics has bolstered the belief that, if the right preparations have been made in advance, even less numerous and seemingly weaker forces can hold off attacks by a heavily armed opponent. The conflict in Ukraine has thus led both to a heightened sense of threat and to renewed hope that, with sufficient effort, a war in the Indo-Pacific can be deterred and, if necessary, won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the need is now clear and widely acknowledged, the ability of the United States to lead its Asian allies in a major, sustained peacetime military buildup could still face significant fiscal constraints. Before the war broke out, some strategists were arguing that the United States should shift the great bulk of its military resources to Asia, leaving its prosperous European allies to finally take on full responsibility for their own defense. This now appears implausible. Barring a regime change in Moscow or the total collapse of Russian power, the U.S. Department of Defense will likely have to allocate more resources to the European theater than it had intended only a few years ago. Over the long term, this will require either a reduction in spending planned for Asia or a permanent increase in the overall size of the defense budget. With outlays still running well below Cold War levels as a share of GDP, the latter option is economically feasible, but it could prove politically difficult in the face of mounting congressional pressure for major cuts in federal spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-states-and-europe&quot;&gt;The United States and Europe&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to Asia, where security concerns were already growing, the war in Ukraine has had an especially dramatic impact on key countries in Europe and on the prospects for transatlantic defense cooperation. After decades of legal neutrality, Russian bellicosity and heightened concerns for their own security have forced both Sweden and Finland to come down from the fence and seek formal affiliation with other European democracies. The two Nordic nations have significant military and defense industrial capabilities, making them especially strong and capable allies. Their geographical location near key waterways and chokepoints and adjacent to Russian territory would strengthen NATO’s ability to defend itself and, if necessary, to conduct powerful counter-offensives against an invader from the east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to wage an effective proxy war against Russia, the United States and its European allies have been compelled to engage in unprecedented levels of consultation and policy coordination. While the United States is far and away the biggest contributor, other NATO members, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, and Canada have also agreed to transfer significant quantities of arms and ammunition to Ukraine, including artillery, anti-tank missiles, and air defense weapons. Beyond the current conflict, recent events have breathed new life into transatlantic planning mechanisms, resulting in what one NATO publication describes as “the biggest overhaul of Allied defence and deterrence since the Cold War.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shock of war has also induced many European countries to commit to major long-term increases in defense spending, potentially alleviating a perennial source of friction with the United States. According to one set of estimates, whereas NATO spending was on track to grow by 14 percent between 2021 and 2026, it is now likely to increase between 53 percent and 65 percent during the same period. One of the major contributors to this buildup will be Germany, which has long failed to meet the official NATO target of devoting 2 percent of its GDP to defense despite having Europe’s largest economy. In the immediate aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, German chancellor Olaf Scholz declared that the world had arrived at an historic turning point, or Zeitenwende. To meet the needs of this new age, Scholz pledged that Germany would finally fulfill its obligations, starting with an increase in defense spending of €100 billion, or roughly $106 billion at current exchange rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the end of the Cold War, some European governments have flirted with the idea of achieving true “strategic autonomy,” building up the European Union’s defenses and its capacity for independent action while reducing dependence on NATO and the United States. This idea seems now to have been abandoned or at least deferred into the indefinite future. In the face of imminent danger from Russia and perhaps, in the longer term, a growing threat from China, there is growing recognition that Europe cannot simply fend for itself but must continue to cleave closely to its American ally. In the words of a recent joint EU-NATO statement, the war in Ukraine demonstrates “more than ever” the “importance of the transatlantic bond.” Enhanced European capabilities are desirable, but their purpose must be to strengthen NATO, which, the EU-NATO statement emphasizes, “remains the foundation of collective defence for its allies and essential for Euro Atlantic security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with all of these signs of growing vigor and cohesion, there are some indications of possible contradictory developments. One year after declaring its intention to make an historic turn, the Scholz government has acknowledged that it will take several more years to reach the goal of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense. If Berlin lags behind, other European governments could revert to a similarly lax attitude about contributing more to the common defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proclamations of unity notwithstanding, the war has revealed significant differences in outlook among Europe’s democracies and, in particular, a division between several of the older, more established nations of the West and the newer members of the liberal order to the east. Bonn and Paris want to see Putin’s aggression fail, but they also hope that Russia can somehow be reengaged economically and that adroit diplomacy can bring it back into what Chancellor Scholz has described as the “peace order” that supposedly existed in the past. By contrast, former members of the old Soviet empire harbor deep and enduring suspicions about Moscow’s intentions and are determined to see it decisively defeated and isolated from the rest of the continent, at least for as long as Putin remains in power. The United States is clearly closer to “new Europe” in this regard, setting the stage for possible future disagreements with Germany and France. Thus, while they appear sturdy at the moment, transatlantic ties may yet be tested by the mounting costs of a protracted conflict or by renewed fears of nuclear escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, despite its recent role in leading opposition to Russian aggression and pressing for closer transatlantic cooperation, there is uncertainty about the permanence of the United States’ commitment to Europe. Some Republicans have sought to revive an “Asia First” strategy along the lines that the party favored in the early years of the Cold War. Alongside a desire to limit defense spending and a belief that China poses the greatest threat to U.S. security, there is an underlying suspicion and resentment of Europe in the minds of some Republicans. Especially in the party’s right wing, there is a belief that many Europeans are “woke,” environment-obsessed, anti-religious, left-leaning free riders whose values and interests have come to diverge significantly from those of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Trump era, some Republicans showed a surprising affinity for an authoritarian, illiberal Russian regime that was the obverse of their contempt for “soft” Western liberal democracies. This sentiment may fade as more familiar attitudes on the right reassert themselves. For now, there is a clear division between those who favor cutting aid to Ukraine and pulling back from Europe and those who support the dominant Cold War-era Republican position of backing fellow democracies against authoritarian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;europe-and-asia&quot;&gt;Europe and Asia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was true during the Cold War, the links between Europe and Asia remain the least developed leg of the democratic strategic triangle. This comes as no surprise. Even the most capable countries in both regions have limited capacity to project military power in sizable increments to the other side of the globe. Recent events have also driven home the fact that the greatest threat in each theater derives from the closer of the two authoritarian powers. Nevertheless, despite these enduring realities, there is a growing sense that the democracies of the Eurasian rimlands face a common danger emanating from the core of the heartland and that they must work together in order to meet it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the signs of this broadening of strategic horizons are significant despite being largely symbolic. In 2022, the NATO summit in Madrid was attended for the first time by observers from the United States’ most important Asian allies: Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, and Australia. With their visitors looking on, NATO members approved a new strategic concept that identified China explicitly as a “systemic challenge” and called for closer political consultation with like-minded Asian nations and “expanded cooperation” on a range of issues, including cyber threats and maritime security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the exception of India and Indonesia, the major democratic powers in Asia have joined in imposing punishing economic sanctions on Russia. Meanwhile, for their part, European officials have expressed growing concern about the threat China presents to freedom of navigation throughout the Indo-Pacific and, more specifically, to the security of Taiwan. Although there is not yet a formal policy regarding the possible imposition of European sanctions in response to Chinese aggression, some commentators have expressed the view that such a step would be appropriate and, indeed, inevitable. According to the newly appointed EU ambassador to Beijing: “In the event of a military invasion [of Taiwan] we have made it very clear that the EU, with the U.S. and its allies, will impose similar or even greater measures than those we have now taken against Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhat more concretely, a number of European and Asian states have recently entered into strategic cooperation agreements with varying configurations and covering everything from consultation and information exchanges to joint exercises and future technology development. Over the course of the past year, South Korea and the United Kingdom, Japan and France, Japan and Italy, and Japan and Germany have all pledged to tighten bilateral defense ties, while Japan, Italy, and the United Kingdom have agreed to work together to develop a next-generation fighter aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Asian democracies have proven that they are willing to provide diplomatic and economic support to their European partners, at least in circumstances where none of them has been directly attacked and where the costs and risks of imposing sanctions and embargos are relatively low. What remains less certain is the extent of Europe’s commitment to Asia under similar conditions. China obviously has far greater economic clout than Russia and could threaten to impose more severe punishment on any outsiders who dared to intercede in a confrontation between Beijing and Taiwan, for example. In such circumstances, Beijing would also seek to muddy the waters, blaming Taipei (and perhaps Washington) for initiating the crisis and trying to persuade key European countries to stand aloof from what Neville Chamberlain once memorably described as a distant quarrel “between people of whom we know nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-states-asia-and-europe&quot;&gt;The United States, Asia, and Europe&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside the realm of military cooperation, the democracies of Europe, Asia, and North America have begun to converge in their views of the values gap that separates them from Russia and China and, albeit tentatively, in their economic policies for dealing with those powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ allies have often been critical in the past of what they regard as its overly ideological, moralistic approach to foreign policy and its supposed proclivity for dividing the world simplistically into “good guys” and “bad guys.” In recent years, however, policymakers in both Europe and Asia have also begun to attribute the aggressive behavior of the authoritarian great powers to the repressive nature of their domestic regimes. Without necessarily calling them out by name, Asian leaders (including South Korea’s newly elected president) now frequently echo American rhetoric, warning that Russia and China together pose a threat to the universal values that unite democracies. Japan’s minister for trade and industry has likewise cautioned that “authoritarian countries have amassed tremendous power, both economically and militarily” and are using it to threaten “a world order based on fundamental values of freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.” A recent statement on EU-NATO cooperation identifies the two main culprits before stating bluntly that “authoritarian actors challenge our interests, values and democratic principles using multiple means — political, economic, technological and military.” In sum, democratic leaders now agree that they face rivals whose animosity and aggression are rooted in illiberal ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has driven home the dangers of economic dependence on potentially hostile regimes. After decades of debate, a new consensus has emerged among Europe’s democracies in favor of diversifying energy supplies away from Russia and drastically reducing imports of its oil and natural gas. The current crisis has also helped fuel doubts about the wisdom of relying on China for a wide range of manufactured goods, chemicals, and natural resources. This issue began to get greater attention during the Covid-19 pandemic, which highlighted the dependence of advanced democracies on Chinese manufacturers of personal protective equipment as well as the chemical precursors used in many medications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worsening relations and the growing danger of future trade disruptions have helped broaden the list of concerns to include everything from semiconductors to the rare-earth minerals used in magnets, batteries, and video displays. In response, the United States and some of its major trading partners have begun to boost subsidies for domestic producers of critical items and contemplate the potential virtues of “friend-shoring” — using tariffs to discourage imports of certain goods from China while encouraging them from countries that are friendly, close by, and preferably both. The process of building out networks of trusted suppliers is still in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as they reduce their dependence on critical imports from the authoritarian powers, the United States and some of its allies have begun to constrict those countries’ access to cutting-edge technologies that could boost their economies and empower their militaries. With Russia already largely isolated, China is the primary focus of these efforts. Over the last five years, the United States, Japan, and the European Union have all imposed new regulations which, to varying degrees, enhance the ability of government agencies to review and potentially block the purchase of domestic firms by foreign companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has taken the lead in imposing new export controls designed to prevent the sale of select, cutting-edge technologies, or the transfer of relevant knowledge, to China. In the recent case of high-end semiconductor manufacturing equipment, Washington has also exerted considerable diplomatic pressure to obtain compliance from allies with capabilities comparable to its own. Beyond individual cases, U.S. officials are working with European and Asian allies to craft common approaches to preserving remaining advantages over their authoritarian rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How far the United States and its allies will ultimately be willing to go in insulating themselves from China, and the extent to which they can harmonize their trade and technology policies toward it, remains to be determined, despite the European Union formally identifying China as a “systemic rival.” Germany, France, and the European Union as a whole have been reluctant to upend relations with a country that they still regard as an indispensable future trading partner. Some Europeans are also wary of what they regard as a self-interested, nationalistic turn in U.S. economic policy, and they fear that, if they follow too closely in Washington’s footsteps, they could be drawn into an avoidable conflict with China. To forestall, or at least to slow such coordination, Beijing has targeted a new “charm offensive” on Europe, which it sees as the weakest link in a tightening democratic chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-struggle-for-the-global-south&quot;&gt;The Struggle for the Global South&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as it solidifies opposing liberal and authoritarian blocs in the Northern Hemisphere, the war in Ukraine has ushered in a new era of intensifying competition between them for influence in the Global South. As in other domains, the United States and China will drive this aspect of the democratic-authoritarian rivalry, with the advanced democracies of Europe and Asia, on the one hand, and Russia, on the other, playing supporting roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Cold War, Russia was actively engaged in the developing world, where it worked to spread communism and outflank the West by backing left-wing governments, cultivating allies, and acquiring military outposts. All of this eventually came to naught with the final demise of the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia’s new leaders had no interest in promoting an ideology in which they themselves no longer believed, and they lacked the means to provide economic assistance to countries whose impoverishment in some cases only marginally exceeded their own. Arms sales became the primary tool for exerting influence, especially in dealing with countries whose militaries continued to rely on Russian-made equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As relations with the West have worsened over the last two decades, Moscow has intensified and diversified its engagement, including through the provision of mercenaries to train local forces and enhance regime security. Starting in 2015, Russia once again became directly involved in the Middle East, sending forces to help prop up the Syrian government. Following Beijing’s lead, Moscow also began to use propaganda and disinformation to attack Western arrogance and interventionism and associate itself more closely with the outlook and interests of the world’s poorest countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Moscow’s heavy reliance on arms sales and security assistance, the war in Ukraine will likely constrict its ability to exert influence in the developing world. The drawdown of its own stockpiles, the strains on its defense industrial base, and the poor performance of some of its weapon systems will make it more difficult for Russia to hold its place as an arms supplier. Massive casualties could also mean that fewer men will be available to serve as mercenaries and trainers or be involved in overseas military adventures. Russia will remain a major arms seller, but its incompetence, its failures on the battlefield, and its sheer brutality will diminish its reputation for martial skill and its desirability as a role model for aspiring regional powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is true for Russia, China’s interest in the Global South has fluctuated with the passage of time. Throughout the 1950s and into the early 1970s, Mao regarded what he labeled the “third world” as central to his dreams of leading a global revolution and his hopes of pushing back against Western, and later Soviet, “imperialism.” With Mao’s death and the start of “reform and opening up” under Deng Xiaoping, Beijing lost interest in promoting the spread of communism and focused instead on building strong trading ties with advanced industrial nations. In the 1990s and early 2000s, as their economy boomed, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) planners began once again to pay more attention to the developing world, this time viewing it primarily in economic terms as a source of raw materials, another market for inexpensive manufactured products, and a potential destination for China’s growing supply of investment capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, Chinese strategists have come to take a much broader view of the potential importance of the Global South. Indeed, to an extent that has not been fully appreciated, they now see it as central to their plans for pushing back against U.S. and Western hegemony and catapulting their own country into a position of global leadership. This assessment reflects a mix of economic, diplomatic, ideological, and military considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As most of the advanced industrial democracies experience population decline and slower economic growth, and as China’s relations with them worsen, Beijing will need to find new outlets for the products of its vast manufacturing base. The countries of the Global South are still far too poor to take the place of the less populous but far richer nations of the Global North. Nevertheless, with their expanding populations and rising incomes, Africa and South Asia could someday become important new sources of demand for China’s exports and drivers of its continuing economic vitality. This is evidently part of what Xi Jinping has in mind when he declares that China must move toward a “dual circulation” growth model, one that relies less on exports to the advanced industrial nations and more on domestic demand and the markets of the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preferred access to fast-expanding pools of demand for products such as cell phones and IT network switching equipment can also help Chinese companies achieve economies of scale, enabling them to undercut their Western competitors and putting them in position to dominate global markets and set industrial standards that will lock in their advantages. A dwindling working-age population is already causing wages to rise and eroding China’s long-standing advantages as a low-cost manufacturing hub. One way of dealing with this could be for Chinese companies to build new productive capacity in poorer, populous countries. As they look to the next stage in their own development, CCP planners evidently hope that the nations of the Global South will play the same role for them as China once did for the advanced industrial West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economics aside, Beijing clearly sees the developing world as a source of backing in its diplomatic disputes and escalating “discursive struggle” with the West. For example, when faced with recent criticism for mistreating its Uyghur Muslim minority, the CCP regime quickly obtained countervailing statements of support from a collection of developing nations. Beijing has also taken advantage of the fact that, for the most part, the United Nations operates on the principle of one nation, one vote. In recent years, it has used financial inducements to line up backing from poorer countries for its preferred candidates for jobs in various international agencies and its own distinctive interpretation of concepts such as human rights and internet freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas they once focused almost exclusively on their immediate neighborhood and, in particular, on the waters off their eastern seaboard, China’s planners now see virtually the entire Global South as a domain of strategic rivalry with the West and as a potential theater for future military operations. Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is clearly motivated in part by the desire to build more secure transport links between China and its suppliers of energy, food, and raw materials. Shipments by road and rail along the BRI’s overland axes cannot compete on price with maritime bulk transport, but in the event of a major conflict, they could help minimize the effects of a naval blockade and permit sufficient imports to keep China’s war economy running. New ports, canals, and pipelines in South and Southeast Asia could enable China’s maritime fleet to bypass key chokepoints, reducing its vulnerability to interdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having abandoned its previous objections to overseas bases, Beijing now appears intent on building a network of facilities that could extend from the Horn of Africa south and east around the rim of the Indian Ocean, west and north along the Atlantic coast of Africa, and perhaps across the Atlantic into the Western Hemisphere. Attacks launched from some of these locations could close vital waterways such as the Suez or Panama Canals at the outset of a future war, slowing the movement of U.S. forces from its east coast to the Indo-Pacific theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has thus far been careful not to trigger Washington’s historically rooted reflexes by venturing too far into what the Americans still regard as their own backyard. Despite this lingering caution, China could take the further step of raising the profile of its involvement in the Western Hemisphere as the Sino-American rivalry intensifies, perhaps gaining access to ports and airfields within range of the California coastline, the Caribbean, and the Panama Canal. By pressing in closer to its most powerful rival, Beijing may hope to flip the field, forcing the United States to pull back from the Indo-Pacific and compelling it to focus more on defending its own “near abroad” rather than on trying to contain China. Harkening back to one of Mao’s favorite stratagems, Xi and his underlings may hope that they too can “surround the city from the countryside,” using positions of strength in the less-developed world to escape encirclement and launch a campaign of counter-encirclement against their richer and still more capable opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past 75 years, the intensity of the United States’ engagement with most parts of the developing world has fluctuated depending on the perceived presence of an urgent geopolitical or ideological threat. For the first three decades of the Cold War, the United States devoted increasing resources to stemming communist subversion in Latin America and across the newly liberated former colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia. U.S. interest and involvement peaked during the Vietnam War, dwindled with the collapse of the Soviet Union, then grew again after 9/11 and the onset of the so-called global war on terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is now in the early days of a new cycle of strategically motivated engagement in the Global South. Despite a strong desire among both Republicans and Democrats to pull back from quagmires and “forever wars,” U.S. policymakers find themselves forced to wrestle with the question of how best to counter growing Chinese and, to a lesser extent, Russian presence and influence in parts of the developing world. The urgency and complexity of this task have been highlighted by the reluctance of many poorer countries to join the advanced industrial democracies in denouncing Russia’s aggression, or criticizing Beijing’s tacit support for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some observers have interpreted these developments as heralding the emergence of a new nonaligned movement, along the lines that many advocated during the Cold War. There is, however, very little reason to think that a cohesive, powerful southern bloc is any more plausible today than it was 50 years ago. The nations of the Global South do not share a common ideology, and they have a wide variety of domestic institutions and enjoy disparate levels of political freedom and economic development. Some lean toward democratic Western powers, others toward authoritarian Eastern ones. And while many poorer countries may hope to play one side against the other in order to extract benefits for themselves from both, they show no signs of pursuing a coherent, collective strategy designed to benefit them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For much of the past two decades China was able to steal a march on its rivals, taking advantage of their preoccupation with other problems to enhance its presence and extend its influence across wide swaths of the developing world. Starting with the announcement of the BRI in 2013, U.S. and allied observers began to pay more attention to China’s economic, diplomatic, and military activities in the developing world, but they were slow to develop a clear view of how these disparate pieces fit together or what their larger purpose might be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While differences remain, there is increasing recognition among advanced democracies that Beijing’s actions are neither benign nor purely commercial in intent and that they must be countered and offset. Separately and together, the United States and its allies have initiated programs to provide transparent, low-cost alternatives to Chinese funding to developing countries seeking to upgrade their transportation, communication, and power-generating infrastructure. Beyond these specific sectors, the U.S. government is in the process of revamping its entire approach to development assistance so that it can compete more effectively against China. At the United Nations, Washington has also taken a particular interest in countering CCP influence operations in key developing countries and across entire regions, especially Africa. Meanwhile, the Department of Defense and the U.S. intelligence community are watching closely for signs that Beijing is trying to acquire more overseas bases and considering ways to block and, if necessary, respond to such developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as the United States and its allies are beginning to focus more of their attention on China’s activities in the developing world, recent events have elevated its importance to Beijing. The downward spiral in relations with the United States and the wider West seems, if anything, to be sharpening Beijing’s southward focus, encouraging it to launch new and as yet ill-defined global security and development initiatives. The prospect of stricter limitations on China’s access to the markets of advanced industrial democracies has added urgency to the search for alternative outlets for exports and investment. The increasingly open “systemic rivalry” with the West has encouraged Beijing to become more vocal and explicit in proclaiming that it has a superior alternative to liberal democracy. And the growing plausibility of a future military conflict seems certain to accelerate China’s efforts to acquire overseas bases and access agreements. All of this, in turn, will heighten the anxieties and spur the counter-reactions of democracies. The contest for influence in the Global South has now been fully joined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment offered here has three broad implications for U.S. strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, at least for the moment, there is virtually no chance of driving a wedge between Moscow and Beijing. When this possibility was discussed a few years ago, the question was what, if anything, democracies could offer Russia that might help to peel it away from China. Today, the question has been reversed, but the answer is still the same. The authoritarian powers are joined at the hip, and there is no inducement that democracies might conceivably be willing to extend at this point that would have any chance of splitting them apart. Pursuing this illusory goal would be a waste of time at best, and if it resulted in concessions that strengthened China’s hand, it could actually be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies would be better advised to take the opposite tack, highlighting Beijing’s complicity in Moscow’s barbarism, emphasizing the commonalities in worldview and interests that bind the two authoritarian powers, and making clear the threat that they pose to the liberal democracies and to any smaller and weaker states, regardless of regime type, that happen to run afoul of them. The democracies must also continue to monitor closely the evolving channels through which Beijing may seek to provide aid and comfort to Moscow. And they must be prepared to impose substantial, escalating costs if China begins to do more than it is already doing to keep Russia afloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, with respect to its major allies in Europe and Asia, the object of U.S. strategy must be to draw these countries together as closely as possible so that they begin to resemble a true, global “free world” alliance. In addition to intelligence sharing, joint military planning, and close diplomatic coordination, the democracies should engage in advanced consultation and serious, detailed preparation for the imposition of harsh collective sanctions on potential aggressors. The threat of sanctions is insufficient in itself to deter a determined predatory state. Still, had Vladimir Putin known in advance the full extent of the economic punishment that would be inflicted on his country, there is at least a chance that he could have been dissuaded from invading Ukraine. As Xi Jinping contemplates the possibility of moving against Taiwan, he should have little doubt about the sweeping trade, travel, and financial restrictions democracies will impose in response, even at substantial cost to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the longer run, the United States and its key partners in Europe and Asia should work together to create a more integrated economic subsystem similar in some respects to the one they constructed during the Cold War. The core of such a bloc would be comprised of a group of like-minded advanced industrial countries willing to lower barriers to flows of goods, capital, information, and people among themselves while imposing some restrictions on their economic interaction with the authoritarian powers, and especially with China. These countries should seek to maintain their existing advantages by slowing or blocking the transfer of cutting-edge technologies while expanding scientific, technical, and industrial collaboration among themselves. The members of this grouping should also limit the danger of espionage or sabotage by collectively prohibiting the use of Chinese-made equipment in critical infrastructure. The advanced democracies must also take steps to reduce their vulnerability to threatened or actual disruptions in supplies of critical materials and manufactured goods by increasing domestic productive capacity and building out networks comprised of trusted, like-minded countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate objective of these measures would not be total decoupling but rather partial disengagement — a greater degree of separation and insulation from authoritarian powers that continue to take advantage of democracies’ openness but whose interests and values are inimical to their own. The United States and some of the other advanced industrial nations have already begun to take steps in this direction in recent years. To date, however, their activities have been only loosely coordinated, leaving many loopholes and potential work-arounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the democracies need to develop a coherent, collective approach to dealing with the Global South, including (but not limited to) a strategy for countering Russian and Chinese influence there. Having sometimes paid insufficient attention in the past, there is a danger that Washington, in particular, will now be prone to overreact. If it responds reflexively, especially to Beijing’s increasingly widespread and diverse activities, it could wind up wasting resources in places that are actually of little interest or value to it. It is also possible that some of what China is now doing in the developing world will turn out in the long run to be wasteful and perhaps even counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing appears to be betting that it can succeed where the West has often failed, stimulating growth and guiding political development in ways that will serve its own economic and strategic ends. Yet the obstacles that have held developing countries back in the past, including corruption, weak institutions, crippling debt, and political instability, seem certain to persist in many places. Indeed, all of these problems are likely to be made even worse by extensive Chinese intrusion into local societies and economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part for these reasons, Beijing’s activities have begun to stir resentment in portions of Africa, Central and South Asia, and the South Pacific. In countries that have achieved at least a degree of political liberalization, advanced democracies can help to fuel the forces of resistance and slow the spread of China’s corrosive influence by supporting civil society groups that favor a free press, fair elections, an independent judiciary, and scrupulous oversight of government contracting. More generally, and in spite of their own past track records, the democracies need to make the case that it is China, rather than themselves, that has taken on the role of a neo-imperialist power. Notwithstanding its ceaseless rhetoric about “win-win cooperation” and building a “community of common destiny,” it is Beijing that seeks to penetrate and gain leverage over smaller and weaker countries, establishing relationships of dependence and exploiting them for its own benefit. The democracies can offset some of China’s appeal by providing more capital for sound investments that benefit entire societies rather than select elites and by opening their own educational systems and markets more widely to people and goods from the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its partners need to set priorities and, to the extent possible, divide the labor among themselves. Even as the United States takes a global perspective, others will focus their energies on countries and regions where they have special experience, access, and influence, such as Britain and France in parts of Africa, for example, or Japan and South Korea in Central Asia. As for priorities, rather than attempting to promote the further spread of democracy, Western powers should concentrate on helping to bolster democratic practices and institutions where these have already begun to take root. Beyond this, the United States and its allies need to focus on countering Chinese influence in countries that contain large reserves of critical resources and that sit adjacent to major maritime chokepoints. Regardless of regime type, states such as India, the Philippines, or Vietnam, which for their own reasons are willing to contribute to balancing Beijing’s power, are also worthy of at least some forms of support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to meeting potential threats, the democracies should be alert to opportunities to make China pay a price for its ambitions. Exposing the corruption and brutality of some of those Beijing is backing could help to damage its reputation and curtail its influence in the developing world and beyond. Supporting forces that seek to resist China and its local clients could draw Beijing into costly internal conflicts that are difficult to win. CCP strategists seem to believe that they can have the benefits of deep engagement in the developing world while avoiding quagmires and overextension. Like the United States and the Soviet Union, Beijing may soon find that its reach has exceeded its grasp.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 1991, Ukraine inherited a science, technology, and innovation (ST&amp;amp;I) ecosystem that mainly supported the Soviet Union’s military industrial complex, space exploration, and propaganda machine.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; The system has deeply rooted challenges such as inefficiencies, underfunding, and opacity in processes. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought a new host of additional challenges including displacement of students and educators, damage and destruction of educational facilities, and power outages affecting online learning options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To realize its full potential and become an engine of innovation and economic growth, this ecosystem needs to be reformed,&lt;/strong&gt; including on issues such as its financing, quality assurance, and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the short run, the biggest challenge is to ensure support for Ukrainian researchers, scientists, educators, administrators, and students and keep key institutions afloat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the medium to long run, deeper reforms are needed for this ecosystem to become a world-class center of R&amp;amp;D and innovation.&lt;/strong&gt; Stakeholders must come together and realize a modern vision for the sector, one that looks to the West and is anchored in EU integration. This includes taking significant steps to improve the financial autonomy of higher education institutions, foster the commercialization of R&amp;amp;D, introduce an independent quality assurance system, improve integrity and combat corruption within institutions, rebalance academic disciplines, and promote cross-cultural exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education and research and development (R&amp;amp;D) are critical drivers of economic growth and innovation. Although Ukraine has strong levels of human capital and numerous higher education institutions, the country’s science, technology, and innovation (ST&amp;amp;I) ecosystem faces challenges predating the current war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Ukraine declared its independence in 1991, it inherited an ST&amp;amp;I ecosystem including higher education institutions that mainly supported the Soviet Union’s military industrial complex, space exploration, and propaganda machine. In the years following Ukraine’s independence, this ecosystem has been largely undervalued and in need of reform to achieve its full potential. The way the sector is financed, the quantity versus quality of institutions, skills mismatches present in the labor market, and the decreasing youth population have negatively affected the sector’s potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020 Ukraine spent 5.4 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on education, one of the highest percentages among EU countries. However, the education system is inefficient, lacks transparency, and does not prepare students for the demands of the workforce. In addition, Russia’s ongoing war has heavily damaged Ukraine’s ST&amp;amp;I infrastructure, including universities, scientific institutions, and research centers, and has prompted nearly a quarter of Ukraine’s scientific workforce to emigrate. This ecosystem must be rebuilt, but more importantly, it must play a significant role in transforming Ukraine into a modern nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of international agencies and think tanks outlined the importance of supporting the ST&amp;amp;I of Ukraine as an engine of economic growth and future innovation. Their overall assessment of Ukraine’s ST&amp;amp;I system is that the sector has been deprioritized and underfunded and that it is shrinking and in need of deep reform. Drawing on this research and expert interviews, this brief describes the main challenges of Ukraine’s ST&amp;amp;I ecosystem and presents recommendations to strengthen the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-in-ukraines-sti-ecosystem&quot;&gt;Challenges in Ukraine’s ST&amp;amp;I Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s ST&amp;amp;I ecosystem is complex and requires a cross-sectoral understanding of its structures, players, and politics. As in most countries, the ST&amp;amp;I ecosystem of Ukraine consists of diverse players, including the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NASU), higher education institutions (including private and public universities), technoparks, R&amp;amp;D institutions, and private companies. A legacy of the Soviet era, the system has an inward orientation: the state funded it mainly to support the military industrial complex, so it is not designed to compete internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A distinct characteristic of the Ukrainian system is that it separates R&amp;amp;D institutions from universities, both in funding and structure. Most R&amp;amp;D funding the state provides is allocated to the NASU, but the NASU’s budget and decisions are under the jurisdiction of Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament). Aside from collaboration with Kyiv Academic University and other relationship-based partnerships with universities, NASU R&amp;amp;D opportunities are not embedded in Ukraine’s higher education institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, public universities receive a very small fraction of R&amp;amp;D funding and have little autonomy in pursuing other funding sources. The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, under the Cabinet of Ministers, governs universities and associated institutions, with the Finance Ministry having final say in resource allocation and on numerous occasions blocking important measures such as tax incentives for the technoparks. While Ukrainian universities have academic autonomy, lack of financial autonomy inhibits their ability to make important decisions. The Ministry of Education and Science remains deeply involved in the management of these institutions. Absence of financial autonomy prevents higher education institutions from using their reputational capital, resulting in complete dependence on government funding. But government funding alone is insufficient for academic institutions to pursue research activities. As such, these structural challenges of the Soviet legacy serve as significant barriers to modernizing the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Revolution of Dignity in 2013–14 and Russia’s invasion in 2014 added an enormous boost to the country’s democratization and development efforts, and a number of reforms in the ST&amp;amp;I ecosystem have been proposed. First, in 2005, Ukraine sought to transform its education system into the Bologna Process, an EU standard, to ensure Ukrainian universities are competitive on the world stage. The process consisted of formal alignment of regulations with European standards and integration with European institutions, and discussions on higher education reform aimed at a more Western approach. However, the Ukrainian government made only a few attempts to change its post-Soviet practices, concentrating its efforts on nonessential bureaucratic and formal tasks. Following through on the objectives of this reform is critical for maintaining a healthy pipeline of international students as well as Ukrainian students who face opportunities to pursue education elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second reform is the law on higher education adopted by the Verkhovna Rada in September 2014. This important law highlights the critical role of institutional autonomy for higher education institutions on both the financial and programmatic sides by codifying the basis for a reformed and well-functioning system of higher education. The law also recognizes the need for these institutions to create environments in which competitive human capital can be shaped to meet the needs of the current labor market, as well as spur innovation and economic growth. However, the law still lacks full implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third important reform, a 2016 law on scientific and scientific-technical activity, would add two new independent bodies: (a) the National Council of Ukraine on the Development of Science and Technology as a decisionmaking body for all key stakeholders in the Ukraine ST&amp;amp;I ecosystem and (b) the National Research Foundation of Ukraine, an independent institution to support R&amp;amp;D of independent academics. This reform is still being implemented and changes the governance of ST&amp;amp;I such that universities are placed under the same jurisdiction as the NASU, improving the integration of the NASU in the overall ecosystem while making universities more autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, Ukraine has been transforming its intellectual property (IP) system. In 2016, the State Intellectual Property Service was abolished, and its functions were moved to the Ministry for Development of Economy and Trade. On September 29, 2017, the High Court on Intellectual Property of Ukraine was established. Since 2018, this special IP committee has advised the Cabinet of Ministers on policies and coordination of actions of the executive branch in this area. Most importantly, the legal system underwent fundamental changes. Up until 2017, intellectual property was not separate from family, civil, housing, land, or labor law and was under the local level of regional municipalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the international community has supported Ukraine in reforming and modernizing the country’s ST&amp;amp;I system. One significant initiative is a five-year World Bank project worth $200 million, launched in May 2021. Besides being consistent with the aforementioned reforms, its overall objective is to make the higher education system more efficient and increase transparency and cooperation between different institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought a new host of additional challenges including displacement of students and educators, damage and destruction of educational facilities, and power outages affecting online learning options. Due to the ongoing war with Russia, many university budgets have been slashed by at least two-thirds. Out of the 749 tertiary institutions surveyed by the World Bank, 21 percent had lost over $115 million due to the war, as of October 25, 2022. In addition to the significant financial constraints from students and the government, 91 percent of institutions reported that up to 30 percent of their students had to be evacuated abroad, while 63 percent stated almost 30 percent of their students were internally displaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people make Ukraine. Thus, in the short run, the biggest challenge is to ensure support for Ukrainian researchers, scientists, educators, administrators, and students and keep key institutions afloat. In the medium to long run, deeper reforms are needed for this ecosystem to become a world-class center of R&amp;amp;D and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;immediate-needs-keeping-quality-institutions-afloat&quot;&gt;Immediate Needs: Keeping Quality Institutions Afloat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way the international community can assist Ukraine’s education administration is through financial aid. From February to August 2022, the United States provided $8.5 billion in direct budgetary support to the Ukrainian government to ensure core institutions like hospitals and schools stay afloat. In addition, the European Union approved an €18 billion assistance package to Ukraine that includes supporting the continual operations of Ukrainian schools. Additionally, countries like Germany have donated €10 million to Education Cannot Wait programs in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of financial support, the Ukrainian education sector desperately needs to prevent brain drain. In addition to the university-aged students who have fled abroad, thousands of academics and over 22,000 teachers have left Ukraine in search of refuge. To reduce the effects of Ukraine’s brain drain, outside higher education institutions could partner with Ukrainian universities on research projects and consultancies. For example, Erasmus+, an EU study-and-work-away program, has supported numerous projects in Ukraine and hopes to bring foreign academics and students to Kyiv in 2023. Alongside Erasmus+, the National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy has provided opportunities for Ukrainian students by opening local offices at the University of Toronto, Justus Liebig University, Vilnius University, and the University of Glasgow. These offices will allow students from these universities the chance to conduct joint research in Ukraine and create joint educational programs and training courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to preventing brain drain and providing financial aid, the international community can assist Ukraine’s higher education institutions by establishing nonresidential fellowships for Ukrainian professors and researchers. For the sponsoring institution, these fellowships are more economical, are easier to administer, and provide significant help for faculty members who do not have the financial means to continue their work in Ukraine. For example, Indiana University Bloomington recently announced it will send $5,000 to up to 20 humanities and social sciences scholars who are either in or from Ukraine for one year through its new IU-Ukraine Nonresidential Scholars Program. To foster collaboration between faculty members and administrators at Ukrainian Catholic University, the University of Notre Dame has offered research grants for academics in Ukraine and two Ukrainian fellows on campus (see Box 1 for other initiatives).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-1-kyiv-school-of-economics-kse-initiatives&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1. Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) Initiatives&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The KSE has invested in partnerships with academic institutions across the globe, launching Ukrainian Global University, a project to invest in Ukraine’s human capital, incubate Ukrainian talent, and ultimately rebuild Ukraine. This project partners scholars with universities throughout the global community. Additionally, the KSE’s charitable foundation has raised over $40 million to fund a range of humanitarian aid initiatives, including talent incubation, bomb shelters in schools, innovation programs during the war, and scholarships for veterans and internally displaced people (IDPs).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;At the University of Toronto, Peter Loewen, director of the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, announced the university’s commitment to fully support 30 students from the KSE to study in the master of global affairs and master of public policy programs. The Canadian government is financing the initiative to demonstrate strong support for Ukraine. The University of Toronto will cover the tuition of selected students, who are also eligible for financial support from Mitacs, a Canadian nonprofit organization, to cover their living expenses. The program is a joint initiative between the KSE and the Munk School, and students will receive diplomas from both institutions.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In addition, George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs supports 20 Ukrainian scientists through its Institute for European, Russian, and Eurasian Studies (IERES) via funding for displaced Ukrainian scholars. This program is intended to support Ukrainian scientists in both political science and international relations. The KSE selected and appointed 12 nonresidential fellows. University of Massachusetts Amherst also delegated $750,000 toward establishing a multilevel partnership with the KSE that allows students to study at University of Massachusetts for up to a year with little to no cost.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In an effort to extend and expand on a 20-year partnership, the University of Houston launched a dual-degree program with the KSE. The program specifically targets brain drain, encouraging Ukrainian students to study in Ukraine but simultaneously earn an international-level diploma. It also helps alumni infiltrate better job markets and international PhD programs in the face of developing an economy during and after wartime.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crafting-a-long-term-vision-for-the-sector&quot;&gt;Crafting a Long-Term Vision for the Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the medium to long run, Ukraine’s education and innovation ecosystem should steer away from its Soviet past. Stakeholders must come together and realize a modern vision for the sector, one that looks to the West and is anchored in EU integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the postwar reconstruction of Europe and South Korea relied heavily on building the nations’ overall ST&amp;amp;I capacity. Similarly, the key to a strong and prosperous Ukraine is a modern ST&amp;amp;I ecosystem, and the Ukrainian government must elevate innovation to the center of the reconstruction strategy. In this regard, supporting implementation of key ST&amp;amp;I reforms is critical in laying the path for a unified vision for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;improve-the-financial-autonomy-of-higher-education-institutions-and-foster-commercialization-of-rd&quot;&gt;Improve the financial autonomy of higher education institutions and foster commercialization of R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s outdated incentive structure puts significant pressure on professors to publish. As with efforts underway in the United States and Europe, publishing should be balanced with other outputs, including involving professors in entrepreneurial efforts to commercialize discoveries as well as mentoring the next generation of researchers and students. Research experiences are an opportunity for students (graduate and undergraduate) to apply their knowledge while still in school. There are many positive outcomes associated with this research expertise: students gain hands-on experience and build social networks that make them more attractive to the labor market and contribute to students’ overall career satisfaction. For example, the United States invests heavily in research experiences for undergraduates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Universities and higher education institutions should alter their structure of incentives to provide each institution with more financial autonomy and responsibility. These changes can include prioritizing funding to schools based on performance, rather than on student population, and allowing universities more freedom when it comes to fundraising. As the Ukrainian higher education sector moves forward, its primary goal should be to provide state and municipal higher education institutions with financial and organizational autonomy. This autonomy should include the authority to manage and implement funds without ministerial approval and to become full owners of their property. In addition to autonomy, the government should ensure all higher education institutions have equal and competitive access to different types of funding. As part of these efforts, the law on higher education of 2014 should be implemented and operationalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduce-an-independent-quality-assurance-system&quot;&gt;Introduce an independent quality assurance system.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian higher education institutions lack a quality assurance system. A successful quality assurance system will require transparency and supportive communication to build and maintain trust. Currently, information on universities and NASU performance is very limited. Such assessments are expensive as they require gathering basic facts, and each discipline will require a unique assessment mechanism. Since 2019, Ukraine has fully implemented the European higher education quality assurance system based on the 2015 Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area (ESG). All Ukrainian universities already have an internal quality assurance system. However, the tools borrowed from the European Higher Education Area are not effective given the lack of self-governance and autonomy in higher education institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, as Ukraine begins its reconstruction efforts, it should focus on creating a more comprehensive and holistic educational system where each stage of education complements the others through knowledge acquisition. For example, by implementing education standards and key performance indicators (KPIs), institutions can monitor and evaluate their teaching and research productivity within the classroom and assess the areas needing improvement. Education standards and KPIs also will foster a more transparent and fair system, as institutions that meet the standards will be rewarded, while those that fail will receive penalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further quality assurance, the Ukrainian education system should change its expected learning outcomes to match the standards of high-achieving OECD countries and provide professional development training and opportunities to professors and teachers as well as financial incentives to keep faculty members at home. ST&amp;amp;I professionals, scholars, and practitioners need to support ongoing efforts to build a more transparent system to assess the quality of higher education institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Ukrainian educational sector should prioritize working in tandem with the European University Association’s new Ukrainian task force as it begins the reconstruction process. The goal of this new task force is to provide guidance, sector-specific strategic support, recommendations, and long-term development in Ukraine’s higher education system both during and after the war. Specifically, topics will include system restructuring, governance and leadership, quality assurance, and more. The program is expected to last for two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;improve-integrity-and-combat-corruption-within-the-sti-ecosystem&quot;&gt;Improve integrity and combat corruption within the ST&amp;amp;I ecosystem.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite attempts to reform the system, the Soviet culture of corruption, including bribes and gifts, is still very much alive in Ukrainian higher education institutions. World Bank estimates point out that close to 25–30 percent of students have directly engaged in academic misconduct or bribery. To gain university access or other advantages, students may resort to illegal practices such as bribery, fraud, misrepresentation, cheating, and exploiting personal connections. Students may also engage in corrupt practices to gain access to dormitory spaces and prestigious disciplines like medicine or law or claim special status (e.g., orphan or other status). These integrity violations are enabled by a decentralized admissions process that lacks transparency and a clear policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to an OECD study, Kyiv-Mohyla Academy is the only public higher education institution mostly free of corruption and one of the few higher education institutions in Ukraine whose degrees are recognized outside the country. The university is modeled after North American universities, engaging in partnerships abroad and adopting international standards. Some deterrents to corruption include a tradition of international exposure and partnerships, academic staff who identify with the institution and its historic mission, and preselection of outstanding students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific actions are being taken to reduce corruption, such as introducing a standardized test for school leavers (undergraduates) evaluated by an independent body and admission tests for master’s candidates. Since 2014, there has been a rise in investigations of plagiarism conducted by governmental officials, especially those involved in decisionmaking concerning ST&amp;amp;I. However, most of that effort has been based on volunteers. Providing systematic support for these efforts would help to accelerate the pace of cultural change in the education sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rebalance-academic-disciplines&quot;&gt;Rebalance academic disciplines.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Soviet times, STEM was prioritized in academia and research. As a result, STEM fields account for close to 90 percent of total research output. Moreover, although disciplines such as the social sciences, economics, and humanities have higher student enrollment than STEM fields, they produce less than 5 percent of research output (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xqIabYN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;

Number of Students in Ukrainian Higher Education Institutions by Discipline, 1989 versus 2017.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/55f9390c-9c8b-555e-9a2f-d200039eec2a/content&quot;&gt;World Bank, Review of the Education Sector in Ukraine: Moving toward Effectiveness, Equity, and Efficiency (Washington, DC: World Bank, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although STEM fields are essential, so are disciplines such as the humanities, political science, and social sciences for a number of reasons. These disciplines promote democratization and facilitate a multidisciplinary culture essential for innovation. As in Western nations, men dominate Ukraine’s more scientific and technology-based majors, while more humanitarian majors have a higher percentage of women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for social disciplines is particularly important in the disinformation space and preservation of Ukrainian heritage and contemporary art that has been critical in fighting the “soft power” of the Russian propaganda machine. Disciplines such as history, communication, and psychology will be important in Ukraine’s ability to successfully fight Russian propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other disciplines will also play an important role for the future of Ukraine. The medical profession in Ukraine has attracted international students due to the low tuition fees, highly ranked medical programs, and energetic marketing tactics. Physical therapy, rehabilitation, and mental health not only are critical in meeting enormous demand from the Ukrainian population but also represent areas of growth and innovation in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;promote-cross-cultural-exchanges&quot;&gt;Promote cross-cultural exchanges.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian ST&amp;amp;I ecosystem needs a value system that is more aligned with Western traditions. One way to ensure this transition is for Ukraine to continue, as well as expand on, its collaboration and cooperation with international institutions and universities. In addition to receiving support for Ukrainians at home, Ukraine should further its educational revival by increasing its educational exchanges with the Erasmus+ program and other European universities. In addition, to increase Ukraine’s cooperation with EU and Western institutions, the rate of English language proficiency needs to be much higher in all disciplines. Ukraine will need to invest more resources in learning new languages, with a focus on English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Ukrainian educational sector should prioritize working in tandem with the European University Association’s new Ukrainian task force as it begins its reconstruction process. The goal of this new task force is to provide guidance, sector-specific strategic support, recommendations, and long-term development in Ukraine’s higher education system both during and after the war. Topics include system restructuring, governance and leadership, quality assurance, and more. The program is expected to last for two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only universities with successful alumni and strong programs will survive in today’s Ukraine. In the short run, the international community should support quality institutions that can withstand the stress of the war. Political forces that have been in power in Ukraine since 1991 have dismissed the importance of education and research for the country’s future. Funding higher education institutions should be regarded not as an expense but as an investment in the future of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the war has ripped Ukraine’s social fabric, revealing an unprecedented desire to distance Ukraine from its Soviet past. This distancing is especially important for science, technology, and higher education institutions. Ukraine has an opportunity to break from the past and transform the education ecosystem into an engine of economic growth and scientific discovery for Ukraine and the world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;戴耀廷稱毋須簽協議後向參與者致歉 趙家賢指本土與傳統泛民互信極不足&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;趙家賢指戴耀廷初選後清楚知道「踩到界」、「攬炒十步」如「世界大核爆」感心寒&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qH9tQ9a.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（4日）踏入審訊第38天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢今繼續作供，同意游說戴耀廷毋須參選人簽協議，是為免初選勝出者被DQ並危害「35+計劃」。而戴耀廷在初選記者會公布毋須簽協議後，曾向參與者發訊息致歉，稱不用簽協議是他「個人決定」，「我不想由我的手去製造藉口給政府去DQ任何人」。趙家賢指當時本土抗爭派對此有「超級大意見」，形容他們與傳統民主派「好明顯個互信度係極之不足」。惟趙同意，即使沒有簽署協議，戴耀廷和區諾軒仍可為會上達成的共識做證。他亦同意，鄒家成等人事後發布的「墨落無悔」聲明書與新西協議的字眼和意思大致相同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱戴耀廷69記者會前已向參與者發出共同綱領最終版本&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱戴耀廷6.9記者會前已向參與者發出「共同綱領」最終版本&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方昨展示2020年6月8日，戴耀廷向組織者群組發出的各區協調文件「final」版本。被問是否知道戴曾發給其他與會者，趙表示當時戴曾向他表示，已與各區參與協調和有意參選的團隊接觸，並向相關人士發送各區「共同綱領」最後版本。趙亦重申他和區諾軒建議戴勿要求參選人簽署協議，「戴耀廷係當時仲做緊最後考慮」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 2020年6月9日，戴耀廷舉行初選記者會（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意不要求簽協議是不望留下文件被dq危害35稱與區諾軒好實務看初選&quot;&gt;趙同意不要求簽協議是不望留下文件被DQ危害「35+」、稱與區諾軒「好實務」看初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷於6月9日初選記者會，表示參選人毋須簽署協議。控方展示謄本，會上被問參選人有什麼需要承諾，戴表示：「我哋喺嗰個協調嘅過程裡面呢，其實大家都有個共識，知道點解我哋會希望爭取到35+，咁但係我諗喺《國安法》之下呢⋯⋯我哋唔會愚蠢到自己去製造一個藉口比呢個當權者嚟去DQ我哋參與呢個計劃嘅人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問「共識」是什麼意思，趙指戴是提及各區協調會議過程，而「共識」應是戴在6月8日發出的各區協議最終版本。萬再問戴提及望爭取「35+」的原因，趙未有正面回答，僅指戴當時表達「協調過程參與者大家係有一個共識，但係我哋自己知道我哋冇需要特別講出」，戴亦有提及《國安法》下不想製造藉口讓政權「遞（應為「褫」）」奪參與者資格。吳政亨等人發笑，有人稱是「褫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指他不太明白，指若趙真誠相信戴耀廷稱初選不違法、依《基本法》行事，為何認為會有DQ風險？趙指因當時尚未有《國安法》條文，而當時選舉氣氛和背景與過往不同，選舉主任會審視報名人士各方面情況，有人「入到閘」、有人「入唔到閘」，故他與區諾軒游說戴耀廷，避免有額外的「白紙黑字」文件讓選舉主任可「問多咗嘢」，「簡單嚟講，就係多一事不如少一事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙憶述，二人大概於記者會前一星期左右游說戴，不公開協議和不要求參選人公開簽署。法官李運騰追問，即趙不希望留下任何可能危害「35+計劃」的文件痕跡？趙同意。李再微笑問，他是否認為不透明會有所幫助？趙指當時面臨「不確定性」，他和區諾軒最主要是「好實務」地看初選勝出者能否成功入閘和在官方選舉勝出，「因為如果就算我哋做到初選，比到市民揀選合適嘅人士參選，但結果未能入閘」，就未能反映當時望集中票源的「心意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意墨落無悔聲明字眼及意思與新西協議最終版本相似&quot;&gt;趙同意「墨落無悔」聲明字眼及意思與新西協議最終版本相似&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成等人於記者會翌日，即6月10日發布「墨落無悔」聲明書，提及前一日「戴耀廷教授召開記者會交待初選細節，表示不會要求參選人簽署共同綱領」。控方將「35+立會過半 民主派新西協調機制協議」文件與「墨落無悔」一同展示，趙確認當中「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」的條款一致；而就「五大訴求」的字眼亦類似，只是新西協議稱「特赦抗爭者」，「墨落無悔」稱「撤銷所有抗爭者控罪」；兩者亦有提及若支持度不足，須表明停止選舉工程。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，他們能自行比對兩份文件，無需要求證人閱讀，並問趙會否同意「墨落無悔」兩點聲明的字眼和意思與該份協議相似（bear resemblance）？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷曾稱不用簽協議是他個人決定-趙同意戴是計劃領袖&quot;&gt;戴耀廷曾稱不用簽協議是他「個人決定」 趙同意戴是計劃「領袖」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示WhatsApp紀錄，顯示戴耀廷於6月11日，曾向新西、新東、九西、超級區議會發送廣播訊息，提及：「我先向大家致歉，不用簽署協議是我個人的決定。我不希望由我手上產生一張有可能被政府用來DQ人的名單。在國安法的陰影下，每個人被DQ的風險都很高，我不想由我的手去製造借口給政府去DQ任何人。」戴翌日亦在Facebook公開該訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問，故毋須簽署協議的決定是戴耀廷個人，抑或趙家賢和區諾軒與戴討論後得出？趙指他與區曾游說戴毋須簽署，而戴經思考後在6月9日記者會作此決定。李運騰續指，有趣的是趙稱戴接納了他和區諾軒的建議，但此處戴卻認為決定是他個人責任，是否代表戴是整個計劃的領袖（leader）？趙答「冇錯」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱本土派對毋須簽協議超級大意見對傳統泛民互信度不足-惟戴耀廷可作證&quot;&gt;趙稱本土派對毋須簽協議「超級大意見」、對傳統泛民「互信度不足」 惟戴耀廷可作證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴續在訊息表示，「我事前應先諮詢大家的意見，未有這樣做，實是不符程序的，為此我必須向大家再次表示歉意」。萬問戴是否未諮詢參與者便決定毋須簽署協議，趙指戴在記者會前還在思考是否需簽協議，並向他提及會諮詢與會者意見；但若根據戴在此訊息的說法，「佢應該冇所有人去諮詢，可能只係某幾個人了解咗意見咁解」，並指「咁當然喺嗰時嘅情況，本土抗爭派係超級大意見」，鄒家成和林卓廷發笑。延伸庭的黃之鋒與袁嘉蔚對望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問及其意思，李運騰亦問是指本土派在「墨落無悔」發布前已有強烈意見？趙解釋，本土抗爭派對於與整個民主陣營下傳統民主派光譜一起參與這件事，「好明顯個互信度係極之不足」，並指協調會議「既然大家協調好咗達成共識、主要係戴耀廷做決定同大家傾時，戴耀廷係可以對當中嘅事情做證」。延伸庭有被告稱：「咩呀？」，黃之鋒則皺眉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意法官陳慶偉指，戴能對協調會議上發生的事，包括各方達成的共識作證。陳續問，趙早前稱民主陣營光譜很闊，例如在否決財政預算案上，社民連提出反對但本土抗爭派卻支持，部分選區同意文件使用「會運用」否決權；而雖然參與者未必完全同意否決預算案，但戴還是做了決定？趙同意。陳續指，即使毋須簽署協議文件，但戴仍可為會上的協議作證，並決定究竟同意了什麼，趙回答：「當時嘅情況係咁樣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴稱是否簽署聲明是大家自行決定-趙確認九東新西夾附聲明惟非民動官方文件&quot;&gt;戴稱是否簽署聲明是大家自行決定 趙確認九東新西夾附聲明惟非民動官方文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴續在訊息指：「是否簽署聯合的聲明，確立之前的承諾，是大家自行的決定。無論是怎樣，我都會尊重。我只是希望大家仍能信任我，將來若出現紛爭，我會真誠地見證大家的協議是甚麼。我希望我的錯失不會導致原先已達成的共識破裂，期盼大家仍能保持相互的信任，努力完成接著的公民投票，讓公民能有機會發聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當然，若我再不能得到大家的信任，我也不適合繼續去統籌這次公民投票了。若我再不能得到大家的信任，我也不適合繼續去統籌這次公民投票了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問趙是否知道九東和新西在提名表格夾附「官方文件」，趙指知道兩區有額外夾附簽署了的聲明，但該文件「並不是我哋本身民主動力去做呢個初選時，我哋活動嘅一個官方文件」。控方亦問戴之後有否繼續計劃，趙確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷廣播訊息未向港島及九東等發送-趙稱港島由區諾軒處理九東另有群組&quot;&gt;戴耀廷廣播訊息未向港島及九東等發送 趙稱港島由區諾軒處理、九東另有群組&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，為何戴將上述訊息傳給新西、新東、九西、超級區議會4區，卻沒有傳給香港島、九龍東及衞生服務界？趙表示區諾軒是香港島前任立法會議員，戴就港島事宜「就交畀區諾軒去處理」，亦無建立港島的廣播群組，趙並在法官追問下確認戴有向他如此提及。至於衞生服務界，趙表示知道他們從來沒有開過會議，他亦無參與前期溝通故不清楚；另就九龍東，趙解釋該區的區議員及義工在實務工作上已開設群組，已有很多不同的溝通渠道，因此沒有另外再開廣播群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷於6月12日再向新西、新東、九西和超級區議會4區以廣播訊息發出民主動力的提名表格，翌日再發出修訂提名表格的下載連結。李運騰再關注為何只向該4區發送，趙重申香港島「戴耀廷就主力交咗畀區諾軒」，而九龍東有區議員和義工的群組，「我相信戴耀廷用咗另外一啲方法將呢啲資訊作出發放」，並確認民主動力曾在Facebook發文讓人下載相關表格。趙並確認九龍東有「秘書處」，被問誰負責，趙稱只知道有很多九東的區議員和義工幫手，李運騰問是否包括區議會主席，趙指他作為領導應有參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴耀廷區諾軒就協調會議做見證已足夠-即使沒簽紙亦是互相同意的協議&quot;&gt;趙稱戴耀廷區諾軒就協調會議做見證已「足夠」 即使沒簽紙亦是「互相同意的協議」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒6月19日於組織者群組發訊息回應「墨落無悔」發起人，提及：「我覺得有樣嘢要講清楚：由頭到尾我理解個協議唔係冇咗，而係冇喺記者會公開。至於內文係乜嘢，唔同人有唔同嘅詮釋方法」，又指不介意承認當初記者會「出於好心，結果換來千夫所指」，但不希望候選人將責任歸咎其他候選人和產生不信任，並指部份選區決定再啟會議商量恰當的處理方法。區又指：「同埋有樣嘢我真係忍唔住講——完全唔明白逼人簽份嘢係咪真係咁緊要，我係要出賣你，簽完我都可以背叛，你捉着痛腳咩。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢則回應：「屯門張可森依幾條友就擺明係要隊到行啦⋯⋯仲有大家之前開咗會嘅協議，區軒同埋Benny係有白紙黑字circulate畀大家確認，雖然冇最後簽紙，但係呢個都係一個mutually agreed consents」，「我諗清楚講明，到時區軒同埋benny都會就住啲事情做見證，其實呢個已經足夠」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問及「幾條友」指誰，趙指是包括「墨落無悔」發起人之一的鄒家成和梁晃維，又指「我當時比較認知係張可森」，至於區提及有部分選區決定再啟會議，趙表示從訊息看到但無特別理會，因當時提名期結束，他要處理很多行政工作。就趙提及的「白紙黑字」文件，他確認是不同選區的協調文件；他亦重申，本土派與傳統民主派互信基礎不大，對毋須簽協議「超級大反應」，惟他當時認為即使沒有白紙黑字筆簽署協議，亦是「互相同意的協議」，而戴耀廷和區諾軒二人可就協調會議上的說法做證。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱就簽署協議無收到民主黨討論訊息&quot;&gt;趙稱就簽署協議無收到民主黨討論訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方問及區諾軒6月14日在組織者群組發出的訊息，時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻託區轉告前一晚九東會議情況，提及民主黨立場是「只要是官方的公開協議，他們願意簽」，趙同意自己當時是民主黨成員。被問到民主黨是否有這樣的立場，趙表示當時他只是作為民主黨東區黨團的召集人，但不是民主黨中央委員，「我理解係無特別收到任何討論訊息」。趙亦指他沒有出席九東6月14日的會議，只是在頭兩次有出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息亦提及「我的建議」，萬問「我的建議」是否指區的建議，趙讀畢訊息後表示：「睇得出訊息文筆係區諾軒用嘅字眼」。辯方大律師沈士文表示反對，指趙沒有出席該次會議，而訊息又是由區諾軒發出，質疑問題應是問區而非趙。但萬反駁指趙是訊息的讀者之一，故想問及他對訊息的理解。法官陳慶偉最後認為，無需再問有關問題，指法庭已知道戴在6月8日發出最終協議、戴在翌日亦舉行記者會，「你為何要問這些問題？」控方遂沒有繼續發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢望螢幕轉為去藍光模式稱連日作供眼睛較辛苦-法庭安排以白紙遮蓋&quot;&gt;趙家賢望螢幕轉為去藍光模式稱連日作供眼睛較辛苦 法庭安排以白紙遮蓋&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，今天早休後，趙家賢舉手表示：「法官閣下，我希望可唔可以喺中午開庭之後可以將呢個螢幕轉去藍光嘅模式，因為睇咗幾日之後其實隻眼比較上辛苦」。陳慶偉指會嘗試，但不能作出承諾。陳仲衡問能否向證人提供文件的紙本，萬德豪指並不可行，因有大量文件。陳續向趙指，若他感到不適可隨時通知法庭，可安排休庭讓他休息，又指政府只會提供最基本的東西，對此並無期望，有人發笑。陳續提議，趙可觀看前方的大螢幕投影，趙指「法官閣下⋯⋯多謝你提醒，我自己調整，如果真係好細緻我喺度睇，睇到大我喺嗰度睇，費事要轉嚟轉去麻煩到人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3名法庭職員續上前處理趙的電腦，陳慶偉提議可將電腦螢幕面朝下放置，並以其電腦示範，着法庭職員「將佢拍落嚟啊唔該」，萬德豪亦一度問能否關掉螢幕。職員處理期間，陳再提議可在螢幕上貼上A4紙，職員其後在趙的螢幕貼上三張白紙。鄭達鴻、鄒家成等發笑，有人說痴線。趙其後作供時，螢幕均被白紙遮蓋，惟他甚少抬頭望向前方大螢幕，而是改為望向坐在其右邊法庭傳譯主任的電腦螢幕。午休後，法官陳仲衡特意問趙情況有否改善，趙指「多謝法官閣下，我可以繼續睇前面（大螢幕），如果細隻字我就睇translation（法庭傳譯主任）個位」。傳譯主任並提醒趙家賢要大聲說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（4日）踏入審訊第38天。趙家賢繼續作供，表示2020年7月首次閱讀戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步〉一文，「我係心寒嘅」，不知道戴原來具體寫下初選是其「攬炒嘅大計劃」的其中一部分，「係一步一步去到一個，我講係『世界大核爆』咁嘅情況」，庭上多人大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而戴耀廷在兩辦譴責初選或違法後，曾向所有參選人發訊息指公開說35+目的「不提否決每一個議案，也不說癱瘓政府」，趙指戴「當刻好清楚知道係踩到界」、明顯認知初選抵觸《國安法》，故發訊息「想統一大家口徑」。法官陳慶偉問，戴是否不願初選參與者「越過紅線」觸犯《國安法》，因癱瘓政府運作本身就是「顛覆國家政權」，趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷71指初選應沒犯國安法-趙稱無收參與者意見有行會成員曾稱看不到初選違法&quot;&gt;戴耀廷7.1指初選應沒犯《國安法》 趙稱無收參與者意見、有行會成員曾稱看不到初選違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢下午繼續作供。主控萬德豪續就從趙家賢手機檢取的大量WhatsApp紀錄發問，其中戴耀廷於《國安法》生效首日的2020年7月1日，曾發訊息分析初選會否違《國安法》，指「35+的目標要否決財政預算案，應沒有觸犯國安法…不過，若我的判斷錯誤，應也不阻初選繼續，因大家已有了Plan B的準備。我的看法是初選會繼續。對我的想法，你有甚麼意見，敬請告知」，戴並指「這是我個別給各團隊的訊息」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙解釋戴指「團隊」是指初選參選人，包括不同名單或個人。主控萬德豪問當時有沒有人表達任何意見，趙指當時收不到參選團隊的訊息，而在組織者群組內，區諾軒有提及有記者查詢得知沒有團隊特別有意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問，戴發訊息給趙時，是否已向其他參與者發訊息？抑或是在發訊息前尋求趙的意見？趙沒有正靣回答，並指7月1日《國安法》生效後，有建制人士開始談及初選的問題，記得當時有行政會議成員兼資深大律師曾指「睇唔到初選有任何違法」。惟李運騰微笑指，該資深大律師對協調會議並不知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴曾電聯趙解釋初選法律問題-趙稱作為調解員只可聽法律教授講解&quot;&gt;趙稱戴曾電聯趙解釋初選法律問題 趙稱作為「調解員」只可聽法律教授講解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，其問題很簡單，就是問趙收到該訊息時，戴是否已發給其他人？趙指當時收到訊息時「冇為意佢問緊我意見」，惟再被陳慶偉打斷要求他直接答問題。趙終稱曾與戴耀廷電話聯絡，戴提及有將訊息發給其他參選團隊，「但係我唔能夠喺呢度確認佢用邊種方法、途徑去畀我」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，戴當時有提及他是法律系副教授，並從憲法方面向他們解釋，《國安法》第22及第29條與初選相關的問題，而「由於我只係法律相關服務業嘅調解員，我只可以聽一個法律學副教授嘅講解」，鄒家成聞言發笑。趙確認，簡而言之是他當時沒有表達意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱投票結果被洩露民研要求開記者會發生事就識搵我哋&quot;&gt;趙稱投票結果被洩露民研要求開記者會：發生事就識搵我哋&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢同意民主動力之後繼續籌備初選，亦確認自己曾在7月初發訊息稱超過二百多個投票站已準備好。被問到共有多少個票站，趙疑惑地答：「251？」。初選投票日於7月11至12日舉行，趙亦確認事後曾發訊息指，共有58.2萬人次參與電子投票，及共有2.1萬張紙本投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;中聯辦和港澳辦於初選投票結束後，於7月13日譴責初選涉違法，萬德豪指戴耀廷7月14日曾發訊息提及：「我公開的訊息說35+的目的，是運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，令特區政府問責。不提否決每一個議案，也不說癱瘓政府。供大家參考。」該訊息同時於5個地方選區和2個功能組別的訊息發布群組發送。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問為何戴要發送此訊息，趙先指「有少少背景…」，指前一晚7月13日，香港民意研究所尚未就初選結果完成點票，但電子投票的結果卻因「技術問題洩露咗出去」，並有傳媒取得結果，媒體《巴士的報》更直接將結果公布。香港民研主席及行政總裁鍾庭耀遂立即致電趙，「要求我即刻召開記者會，想即刻將出咗嚟嘅電子投票數字即刻公佈」，趙遂馬上安排緊急採訪通知，告知記者於當晚8時召開記者會。趙主動補充：「即係當發生咗事情嘅時候，佢哋（香港民研）就識得搵我哋召開個會議去解畫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指713記者會首聞戴稱不確認初選是否完全無抵觸國安法從大陸法我唔識&quot;&gt;趙指7.13記者會首聞戴稱不確認初選是否完全無抵觸《國安法》、「從大陸法我唔識」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙表示，記者會上有解釋為何會洩露結果，並提及由戴耀廷指明的香港民研外判IT團隊的運作。趙指戴耀廷亦有出席，但他「坐到好埋，冇諗住作出發言」，直至傳媒提問環節，有傳媒問及政制及內地事務局局長、及中聯辦均有發聲明質疑初選涉違《國安法》，「先至邀請返戴耀廷喺講台最側邊，坐返喺中間記者咪面前」。這時傳譯員一度對側邊及中間等位置感混淆，並向趙澄清其說法，鄒家成亦發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，戴耀廷隨即就初選涉嫌抵觸《國安法》作回應，其回應重點與他早前發送予趙的訊息內容大致相同，都是相關的法律觀點方向。趙續指，不記得戴在記者會臨完結前公開向傳媒表示，抑或記者會後曾向他表示，他所講的法律觀點是從普通法角度，「如果係從大陸法嘅角度，『我唔識呀』」。法庭傳譯主任一度將「大陸法」譯為「PRC law」，法官陳仲衡糾正為「Continental law」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續解釋為何要提及當晚情況，因當晚他聽到戴耀廷說這番話時，「我第一次聽到佢其實係表達緊，佢唔確認現時嘅初選，係咪真係完全無抵觸新嘅《國安法》」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱首閱戴真攬炒十步感心寒-指一步一步去到世界大核爆&quot;&gt;趙稱首閱戴〈真攬炒十步〉感「心寒」 指一步一步去到「世界大核爆」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，到了7月14日，《蘋果日報》政治版資深記者聯絡他，提醒他戴於2020年4月曾發表〈真攬炒十步〉文章，趙表示：「嗰時我第一次睇嗰篇文章嘅時候，我係心寒嘅，因為正如一個，好似一步一步嘅計劃嘅策劃、推行」。此時鄒家成發笑，在延伸庭的被告包括黃之鋒亦不禁發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪此時指，最初的問題是趙是否知道，為何戴耀廷要向群組發出「不提否決每一個議案，也不說癱瘓政府」的訊息，趙表示：「就嚟解答到㗎啦！」，被告和律師席傳出笑聲。法官陳仲衡亦表示，望在清明節前完成（Please, before we rise for Ching Ming Festival）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢續解釋，當時他才意識到，「佢（戴耀廷）原來之前已經有咁具體咁寫咗，其實初選係佢所講嘅攬炒嘅大計劃當中嘅其中一部分」。法官李運騰問到，趙在記者會前是否不知道「攬炒十步」，趙答「係，唔知道有咁具體佢寫得咁清楚，係一步一步去到一個，我講係『世界大核爆』咁嘅情況」。庭上多人大笑，有人說「痴線」、有人笑着重覆「世界大核爆」，延伸庭袁嘉蔚及黃之鋒也發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴當刻係好清楚知道係踩到界-官提醒不是講述自己推論&quot;&gt;趙稱戴「當刻係好清楚知道係踩到界」 官提醒不是講述自己推論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問回控方最初的問題，問戴在訊息是否表達「有啲咩嘢佢公開講，有啲咩佢冇公開講」，趙回答「多謝法官閣下」，指7月14日他收到這個訊息時尚未為意，但「之後諗返睇返，就清楚戴耀廷係當刻係好清楚知道係踩到界，有違反《國安法》嘅成份喺當中」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續向趙家賢表示，「你需要清楚區分你作為事實證人的角色，及你個人的……我不應該用『揣測（speculation）』這個字，而是你個人的推論（reasoning）和對事件的解釋（rationalization）」，李續指，控方的問題非常簡單，就是趙是否知道戴為何要在7月14日告訴所有人，他曾公開和沒有公開說過的話，並指若趙家賢不知道，可直接回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴明顯認知已抵觸國安法-發訊息想統一大家口徑&quot;&gt;趙稱戴明顯認知已抵觸國安法 發訊息「想統一大家口徑」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢說「多謝法官閣下，我知道，我講得唔清楚，我而家講緊㗎啦」，重申他提及7月13日記者會，是因戴當時開始向他提及不清楚初選有否抵觸《國安法》，故戴翌日再發相關訊息，「好明顯佢已經係認知到有抵觸國安法嘅情況，希望透過呢個訊息係比各個團隊知道喺公開發言嘅時候要小心」。李運騰問，故戴是在警告其他人應該或不應該公開說的話？趙說：「法官閣下，我諗會用嘅係『想統一大家口徑』」，林卓廷皺眉嘆「吓？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續指，戴耀廷的訊息在文法結構上並非最正確，並問以趙理解，戴是否想向參與者表達他「沒有提及」過否決每個議案和癱瘓政府，只是曾提及否決預算案令政府問責，並因此希望萬一參與者被問到，可以「統一口徑」。趙同意。陳續指簡言之，即戴耀廷不希望初選參與者「越過紅線（step over the red line）」，即觸犯《國安法》，「因為癱瘓政府運作本身就是顛覆國家政權（subversion）」。趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷提名期後為各區開設候選人whatsapp群組&quot;&gt;戴耀廷提名期後為各區開設候選人WhatsApp群組&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，萬德豪今提及戴於6月24日，曾在組織者群組表示「我會為每個選區設立一個只有候選人的群組，方便之後的協調，區軒已設立了港島區的群組」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴此前會以廣播功能發訊息予各區參選者。被問到為何戴要在6月再開設不同選區的群組，趙思考數秒後表示，廣播群組與Whatsapp群組功能不同，此前協調會議期間很多時會面對面，而廣播功能可通知很多人出席會議，更為合適。但在初選提名期後，離7月11及12日的初選投票日只剩不夠一個月，參選人要花時間拉票，時間短促下很難聚集人開會，故戴開設群組予協調人和有意參選者，方便訊息即時發送，亦可快速在群組進行簡單討論。趙指這是他從當時情景及實務工作角度而理解開設群組的原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問五一手勢意思-趙形容屬好知名手勢確認沒出席所有選舉論壇&quot;&gt;官問「五一」手勢意思 趙形容屬「好知名手勢」、確認沒出席所有選舉論壇&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙亦確認助手黎敬輝曾於6月25日將初選論壇的照片發送予他，法官陳仲衡問到，相中參選人一手張開手掌、一手舉起手指的姿勢代表甚麼，趙表示這是反修例運動之後「好知名手勢」，代表「五大訴求 缺一不可」。法官李運騰質疑，若控方要問及論壇的問題，需要確立趙曾出席初選論壇。趙確認自己沒有出席所有初選論壇，李逐指控方沒有基礎向他提問，亦指辯方已同意相關事實，控方遂改問其他議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙家賢今亦再確認，九龍東和新界西兩區參選人報名時均夾附「共同綱領」，其中九東寫明「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，新西寫明「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件後天（6日）續審，預計趙將完成主問，並由代表鄭達鴻及梁國雄的資深大律師潘熙開始盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">戴耀廷稱毋須簽協議後向參與者致歉 趙家賢指本土與傳統泛民互信極不足 趙家賢指戴耀廷初選後清楚知道「踩到界」、「攬炒十步」如「世界大核爆」感心寒</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第卅七日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-04-03-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-37.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第卅七日】" /><published>2023-04-03T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-04-03T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-37</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-04-03-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-37.html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/z0Jh4uD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（3日）踏入審訊第37天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢繼續作供，趙上周稱曾出席新東5月5日第二次會議，今改稱沒有出席，由職員黎敬輝做筆記。根據黎的紀錄，戴耀廷會上曾稱共同綱領不提否決預算案「難合乎公眾期望」，鄒家成亦提及要入立法會「癱瘓政府」，趙形容當時本土抗爭派「好進取」、「好漠視」中央政府訊息，想「拉倒」傳統民主派一起運用否決權。趙引黎指，戴耀廷當時望以表決形式定下協議最後版本，會議最終進行投票，「會運用」否決權字眼獲大多數「so-called 通過」，與區諾軒早前稱未達共識不一致。此外，趙亦表示，於7月14日兩辦譴責初選或違法後，才首次完整閱讀戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步〉一文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴耀廷協調會議上提及真攬炒十步否決撥款和解散立法會的大方向&quot;&gt;趙稱戴耀廷協調會議上提及〈真攬炒十步〉否決撥款和解散立法會的「大方向」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今展示戴耀廷2020年4月28日在《蘋果日報》發表的〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉，引述當中第四至七步，即兩次否決預算案致特首辭職及特區政府停擺：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;第四步（2020年10月至2021年4月）。政府向立法會提出的所有撥款申請都被立法會否決。政府只能維持一般運作。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;第五步（2021年5月）。立法會否決政府《財政預算案》，特首解散立法會，並以臨時撥款方式維持政府運作。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;第六步（2021年10月）。立法會重選，民主派或要派出Plan C參選，因Plan B也可能被DQ，但仍取得35席以上。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;第七步（2021年11月）。立法會再次否決《財政預算案》，特首辭職及特區政府停擺。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問趙有否看過文章。趙表示，就第四和第五步，戴耀廷在一些協調會議上有「重點講述個大方向」，他「都知道有呢個概念」，並指戴會上較着重指相關程序是《基本法》賦予立法會的權力、《基本法》條文有仔細提及相關過程。趙並指，戴是大學法律系副教授，而當時參與協調的民主黨和公民黨都有律師和大律師等「法律專業人士」，在戴耀廷倡議和帶動會上方向時，他們並無清晰反對第四和第五步。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱兩辦譴責後獲蘋果記者提醒要小心-714才完整讀完戴耀廷真攬炒十步&quot;&gt;趙稱兩辦譴責後獲《蘋果》記者提醒要小心 7.14才完整讀完戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步〉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，戴耀廷已經認罪，並指問題是趙家賢有否看過文章。趙點頭，指他想帶出的是他本身在協調期間只是對文章第四和第五步內容有認知，「而我真正係成篇文章有睇過，係喺2020年嘅7月14號」，因前一天中聯辦和國務院港澳辦均就初選表達強烈批評、指涉嫌違法，14日當天建制派報章有相關報導並提及戴耀廷這篇文章。趙續指，當時《蘋果日報》一名他認識很久的資深政治版記者，聯絡並轉發他相關報導和戴耀廷的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙欲覆述記者的話時被法官陳仲衡打斷，陳問萬德豪是否需要知道記者的說話，萬續向趙指或不需要知道相關詳情。趙答「係，我想…我盡快講返清楚，個重點其實係想講，佢（記者）提到依啲嘅報導，戴耀廷寫咗篇咁嘅文章，佢自己覺得好有問題，提我你要小心」，鄒家成發笑。趙指，他在該記者提示下，「我就當時係第一次睇整篇文章」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指戴耀廷5月上旬表示統合緊各個區係要簽協議書&quot;&gt;趙指戴耀廷5月上旬表示「統合緊各個區係要簽協議書」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續就九龍東會議發問。庭上展示「35+九東立選座談會」的WhatsApp群組紀錄，戴耀廷4月30日發訊息指「各位阿姐阿哥，新一次九東立選座談會會定於5月4號」，並列出會議時間地點。趙家賢確認他沒有出席當晚會議，並再次託民主動力總幹事黎敬輝記錄會議內容，黎於5月5日早上近7時發出會議重點筆記。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師馬維騉一度提出反對，指趙家賢沒有出席會議，不能確認紀錄的準確性，法官陳慶偉不接納，主控萬德豪並指他並非要確立紀錄的準確性，只是想詢問趙是否認識與會者。根據黎的紀錄，當天與會者包括戴耀廷、施德來、譚文豪、黃之鋒、蔡澤鴻、李嘉達、人民力量劉嘉鴻。黎並指戴耀廷會上提及其他區的方案，包括「重啟政改，否決預算案，支援抗爭者」，又提及「需簽協議書」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問趙「需簽協議書」的意思，趙指在九東，「大家嘅共識係喺共同綱領下簽協議書」。法官李運騰問趙沒有出席又如何得知，是否有與會者告訴他會上內容？趙指戴耀廷5月上旬有向他表示，「佢係統合緊各個區係要簽協議書嘅」，但不記得確實日子，同意法官指戴當時向他指，正考慮要求參與者簽署協議。法官陳仲衡亦問及紀錄上指時任黃大仙區議員尤漢邦提及「黃大仙區議員聯署聲明」，趙解釋當時黃大仙區議員有一份聯署聲明，要求初選參選人要遵守一些條款或約章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡澤鴻於九東會議翌日，在群組發出「35+九東final」文件，表示「昨晚戴教授召開九東立選座談會，會上大家同意進行初選，以上是初步協調結果」，並於3日後再發送「35+九東final」文件，稱「之前的版本漏咗段，這才是最終版本，也附上英文版」，並發出「35+KE final」文件。惟控方指未能擷取相關文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙上周稱有出席55新東會議-今改稱沒有出席&quot;&gt;趙上周稱有出席5.5新東會議 今改稱沒有出席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於新界東，於5月5日舉行第二次會議，趙家賢當天發訊息問黎是否已到達、「又要再次靠你啦」，趙解釋他同樣未能出席會議，故拜託黎敬輝做紀錄。趙續主動指，「主控、法官閣下，我知道有個位我要澄清返」，指他上周供稱有出席5月5日新東會議，但他「回憶返」，其實5月初東區區議會有很多不同會議，故他並無出席是次新東會議，是託黎敬輝了解和匯報。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，那他有否出席4月14日的首次新東會議？趙指，「我之後清楚回想返呢，新界東同新界西會議，我只係各去咗一次，就係第一次」。趙上周供稱在新東首次會議上，鄒家成就否決預算案質疑傳統民主派立場，李運騰當時問該討論在第5次會議有否發生，趙指之後會議都有繼續討論。李運騰續指，故現在趙指鄒家成的言論，必定是在4月14日的首次新東會議發生？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方讀出多則黎敬輝就新東第二次會議的紀錄-戴耀廷稱不提否決預算案難符公眾期望&quot;&gt;控方讀出多則黎敬輝就新東第二次會議的紀錄 戴耀廷稱不提否決預算案難符公眾期望&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示黎敬輝於會議翌日凌晨約2時半發出的紀錄，提及時任沙田區議會主席程張迎及「豐」，趙指「豐」為公民黨高級職員。黎的紀錄顯示：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;程張迎：有人提及如講明否決預算案，可能觸及基本法相關不支持體制而有被DQ風險，否決預算案是由CP提出&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Benny（即戴耀廷）：綱領不提及否決預算案難合乎公眾期望，可能需DQ出現時，Plan B代為表達意見。如政府都會玩得太盡，全部DQ，可能要杯葛選舉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;豐 CP.：對，不能迴避否決預算案的方向&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Benny：會議共識是較多數人的認同，接納可接受的方案（啃得落）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;鄒家成：如我們不決意，如何說服香港人於初選投票，推我地入去立法會癱瘓政府&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;呂智恒：兩辦施壓目的令大家自我審查，如綱領已傾向保守，不敢用明確字眼，已正中下懷。DQ我地控制唔到，只有愈團結，政府愈難大規模DQ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;何桂藍：如以基本法條文作出DQ，必引起大迴響，故綱領更進取較好&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Benny：其他區都支持否決budget&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成會上提癱瘓政府-趙稱本土派想拉倒傳統民主派好漠視中央訊息&quot;&gt;鄒家成會上提「癱瘓政府」 趙稱本土派想「拉倒」傳統民主派、好漠視中央訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢表示，閱讀訊息後，有向黎敬輝面對面查詢會議細節。法官陳仲衡問他看到訊息有何感受，趙指看到本土抗爭派在會議上「好進取地，甚至乎係……對於中央政府一啲嘅訊息係好漠視」。陳仲衡再問，會上有人提到想癱瘓政府，趙當時有沒有向任何組織者討論「35+計劃」的發展？趙指，當時有向助理了解鄒家成提及「癱瘓政府」時整體會議的氣氛，黎指本土抗爭派候選人或團隊當時都有點頭或表示同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FpNwvF6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄒家成（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在陳仲衡追問下，指當時「應該有」與戴耀廷討論，反而沒有與區諾軒討論，並確認當時民主動力尚未正式加入「35+計劃」。法官李運騰問，趙收到訊息後，有否擔心「35+計劃」的走勢？趙指，當時留意到本土抗爭派「係想將佢哋想做到嘅一啲目標或者係方向呢，喺個會議裡面係要，叫做『拉倒』傳統民主派都要一齊去做」。他其後在法官陳慶偉詢問下，解釋是指本土派望傳統民主派與他們一起運用否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;新東第二次會議通過會運用-趙引助手指戴耀廷望表決以大比數so-called-通過&quot;&gt;新東第二次會議通過「會運用」 趙引助手指戴耀廷望表決、以大比數「so-called 通過」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指那是趙當時的假設和理解，那他有採取什麼行動嗎？趙續提及紀錄最後顯示：「『會運用』-投票通過」，指他當時就該句「好着重問助手當時發生嘅事」，因他認為民主黨代表李永成在會上的發言「都係溫和」，而趙家賢曾任民主黨中央委員，知道在會議上若有其他團體要投票的話，「我好深信佢（李永成）絕對冇獲得任何授權表態」，遂問助手「點解會投票通過到㗎呢？」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙引述黎指，戴耀廷當時指「嗰份協議要去出最後版本㗎啦」，故望在該次會議以表決的形式「比一個主流嘅大方向出嚟」並進行意向投票，最終「會運用」字眼佔大多數「so-called 通過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱對投票結果感詫異曾向戴耀廷表達-並向戴確認投票情況&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱對投票結果感詫異曾向戴耀廷表達 並向戴確認投票情況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續問及趙與戴耀廷談及什麼，趙指不記得確實何時交談，但一定是他向助手了解後再與戴溝通。陳慶偉打斷指是問他和戴耀廷說什麼，趙表示「法官閣下我而家講解緊」，並稱當時就本土派「咁進取嘅取態」，想向戴耀廷了解會議形勢，並從戴口中確認黎敬輝向他匯報有關會上的投票情況，即「會運用」字眼獲投票通過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙特別向戴提及民主黨代表不獲授權的情況，亦指民主黨等傳統民主派「唔可能用『會運用』（字眼）」，「喺我角度我都係覺得好詫異」。而戴則回應，他有了大方向起草最後版本協議時，會給予所有想出選的團隊，亦會處理民主黨相關情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷新東第二次會議兩日後發出新東協議-提會運用否決權&quot;&gt;戴耀廷新東第二次會議兩日後發出新東協議 提「會運用」否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉亦問，黎敬輝有沒有向趙講及社民連會上的回應？趙指他沒有着重提及。陳續問，趙稱抗爭派嘗試「拉倒」傳統民主派，是否包括社民連，趙指理解民主黨和社民連都是傳統民主派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後問及會議出席者名單，控方展示黎敬輝訊息，提及出席者包括社民連吳文遠、岑子杰和區政聯盟柯耀林。岑子杰終參選九龍東，趙在法官詢問下解釋岑是沙田區議員，故「好順理成章會出席」代表社民連出席新東會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷在會議兩日後發出「35+新東final」文件，表示「這是新東的協議文本」。控方展示該份名為「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新界東協調機制協議」的文件，提及「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，趙確認戴有向他發送。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒曾稱新東就否決權字眼無共識懷疑有不知情黑盒過程&quot;&gt;區諾軒曾稱新東就否決權字眼無共識、懷疑有不知情「黑盒」過程&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前區諾軒曾供稱，鄒家成於第二次新東會議質疑戴耀廷為何用「會運用」而非「會積極運用」字眼，會上林卓廷代表莊榮輝反對，梁國雄代表陳寶瑩亦提及社民連會支持全民退保，最終就否決權字眼未達成共識。但其後新界東鄒家成等發起「墨落無悔」聲明書，並提及各區「已取得共識的共同綱領」，區懷疑是否有他不知情的「黑盒」過程，最後導致共同綱領、或鄒家成認為共識是「會運用」的字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過區的說法與趙家賢供詞不一致，區供稱第二次新東會議的出席者及會上情況，為趙供稱第一次會議的情況；而趙今表示，新東第二次會議上通過「會運用」否決權字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;九西協調文件提會積極運用-趙無出席第二次會議&quot;&gt;九西協調文件提「會積極運用」 趙無出席第二次會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就九龍西，戴耀廷4月28日曾發廣播訊息，提醒九龍西第二次協調會議於4月29日舉行，戴並於會議兩日後發出「35+九西」文件，提及「這是最終的協調文件」。控方展示從趙家賢電話擷取的文件，題為「35+立會過半計劃 民主派九龍西協調機制協議」，內有「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」條款，問趙有否看過。趙指若能從其電話擷取，即他有下載和打開來看。控方其後轉問其他會議情況，惟法官李運騰指控方沒有問及趙有否出席該次九西會議，趙終表示「我印象中我冇出席」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xxDhQca.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（3日）踏入審訊第37天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢繼續作供，確認「簽署相關選區的協議文件」為戴耀廷原本計劃，惟因當時將通過《國安法》，他與區諾軒認為毋須簽署公開的白紙黑字文件可保障參選人，二人成功說服戴耀廷改變主意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官亦關注區諾軒在「35+計劃」的過程中，辦初選的「初心」有否改變，趙形容區「越嚟越變咗係磨心」，指他出身傳統民主派、前民主黨元老李永達曾指「當佢係半個仔」，惟區的立會議席屬本土自決派，故區對如何平衡各方「好困擾」、就兩邊的協作亦「兩面不是人」。趙今作供亦至少六度被法官打斷，要求他簡單直接回答問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙因太古城和你sing遲到超區協調會-指戴耀廷會後再親口邀民動承辦初選&quot;&gt;趙因太古城「和你sing」遲到超區協調會 指戴耀廷會後再親口邀「民動」承辦初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢繼續作供，主控萬德豪續就各區協調會議情況發問。就超級區議會，戴耀廷2020年5月1日發出「35+區二」文件，並提及超區協調會議於5月13日舉行。趙表示，他當天會議臨近結束才到達，因當晚有「連登人」在其太古城選區的太古城中心發起「和你sing」，他強調自己作為當區區議員，要到場「同太古城嘅保安一齊睇住個情況」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續如以往一樣，要求民主動力職員黎敬輝出席會議和記下討論重點，並在「和你sing」結束後搭的士趕到會議。趙補充，當日會議完結、與會者離場後，只剩下他、戴耀廷、區諾軒及黎敬輝4人，「當晚面對面嘅時候，戴耀廷再次親口邀請我同埋民主動力承辦35+初選」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷於超區協調會後稱已達成協議&quot;&gt;戴耀廷於超區協調會後稱已達成協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎敬輝於會議翌日清晨約6時將會議筆記發給趙，當中寫到「Hin: agreement, veto budget」，趙指「Hin」是指區諾軒，並確認筆記提及戴耀廷、王百羽和司馬文。被問到「賢」是指誰，趙思索一會後稱「主控可唔可以轉頭再問，我嘗試回緊帶記憶」，其後稱「印象係模糊嘅，但應該係張秀賢？」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪再問「lester」是指誰，趙思考數秒後才回答：「岑敖暉」，不久後突然補充：「我差啲想講張國榮（Leslie Cheung）」，這時眾被告面露驚訝，有人發笑，鄒家成搖頭，有人說「痴線」。萬追問，趙在當晚會議後有否與其他組織者討論？趙表示，戴耀廷簡單指超級區議會「大家都有agreement（協議）啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5BzZH40.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 岑敖暉（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問區諾軒是否同意否決財案-趙指區實務看初選作用&quot;&gt;官問區諾軒是否同意否決財案 趙指區實務看初選作用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續問，區諾軒稱「agreement, veto budget」，以趙的理解是甚麼意思？趙表示他沒有特別向助手仔細詢問。陳逐追問，從字面理解似乎是代表區同意運用否決權？趙重申沒有向助手釐清寫法，但以他「就咁睇呢個訊息」和對其職員紀錄的解讀，「區諾軒應該係開場嘅時候講返其他區已經有啲協議出嚟，而當中有講到否決財政預算案」，讓與會者知道其他會議的最新消息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢上周曾在陳慶偉詢問下表示，區諾軒在協調會議沒有參與否決預算案的討論，陳續指，但明顯地根據紀錄，區曾在5月13日的會議上提及否決預算案。趙同意「睇到嗰度係有嘅」。陳再追問，根據紀錄，區稱「agreement, veto budget」是指他自己的意見，而非其他地方選區的共識？趙表示以其理解，「區諾軒佢本身係好實務去睇初選嘅作用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問區諾軒初心有否改變-趙指以其觀察越嚟越變咗係磨心&quot;&gt;官問區諾軒初心有否改變 趙指以其觀察「越嚟越變咗係磨心」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳打斷指自己知道區的「初心」，但問區的「初心」有否改變，即除了取得立法會過半議席之外，還有否加入其他目標？趙重申在5月13日的會議上，他只是臨近完結才到場。陳慶偉指即趙不能回答；李運騰續追問，以趙的觀察，區的目標在整個「35+計劃」過程有否改變？趙表示：「我嘅觀察係，佢越嚟越變咗係磨心之一」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙休庭後續解釋，區出身傳統民主派、在南區當選區議員，曾是他在民主黨的「黨友」，在黨內獲「民主派主流派元老」的支持。其後香港眾志羅冠聰被褫奪議席，欲找周庭出選，惟周庭不獲准入閘，故當時改為找區諾軒代表參與2018年港島立法會選舉補選，區並以「獨立民主派」身分當選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指區諾軒就傳統民主派和本土自決派協作-兩面不是人&quot;&gt;趙指區諾軒就傳統民主派和本土自決派協作 「兩面不是人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指，由於當時港島只有一個議席，「變咗香港島唔同光譜、各個派別都梗係會集中票源支持佢」；而區當選後，趙作為香港島東區的區議員，亦會在地區建設和立法會撥款等與區有一定程度交流。趙指，「好坦白講我同區諾軒係冇乜私交嘅……絕大部分都係工作上嘅交流」，並指他與區諾軒不同，區曾任民陣召集人，「佢有時同社運界嘅朋友會食飯、品酒等等，好多呢啲交流活動呢，見到佢都係好……好social」，林卓廷和鄒家成等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，區在工作上「都會有嘢呻畀我聽」，因其議席來自本土自決派的光譜，故該光譜當然希望區在立法會的倡議和做法，是根據他們的價值觀而實行；惟傳統民主派亦對區有「好大期望」，「我記得前民主黨元老李永達直程喺黨會議裡面講，當佢係半個仔咁，『如果佢當選，我當有半個黨員當選咗架啦！』」，被告席傳來笑聲，林卓廷「o嘴」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，在整體政治形勢和關係的背景下，加上區諾軒在南區利東邨是一個「好實務、為基層好實幹」的區議員，故在他任立法會議員時，如何平衡民主陣營「傳統」和「本土」兩邊的光譜，及地區上市民希望務實惠民的理念，「呢幾樣嘢要佢去平衡，係好困擾嘅對佢嚟講」，而區也會如實地了解不同光譜的看法和進行溝通交流，尤其是在初選與戴耀廷一起進行協調時。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 2018年立法會補選，周庭被DQ，區諾軒成為民主派代表出戰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時法官陳慶偉打斷，指似乎話題已扯得太遠（drifting too far）。萬德豪續指，上述是否趙認為區諾軒是「磨心」的原因，趙同意，指因為區諾軒「經常要就住兩邊唔同光譜點樣協作，係有一個好……兩面不是人，或者遇到好多委屈嘅情況」。陳慶偉指，簡而言之，即區諾軒不能取悅所有人（he can’t please everyone）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認簽署相關選區的協議文件為戴耀廷本來計劃&quot;&gt;趙確認「簽署相關選區的協議文件」為戴耀廷本來計劃&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續就WhatsApp紀錄發問。戴耀廷於5月22日曾發出「35+民主派協調機制時間表」，趙同意當時民主動力已參與初選工作。他一度想再講述答應承辦初選的細節，惟被陳慶偉打斷，指現階段不認為該些資料相關，萬德豪稱之後會再重返這議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示時間表，列明5月30日舉行記者會，趙同意記者會後改期至6月9日。時間表亦顯示6月13日至20日為提名期，提名期下的細項列明「簽署相關選區的協議文件」，萬德豪問簽署協議是否原本的計劃（original plan）？趙指該時間表是戴耀廷發給他，而民主動力5月中下旬同意承辦初選後，「個架構就會變咗係戴耀廷同區諾軒係協調人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4eMSTih.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年6月9日民主派初選記者會&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙欲繼續解釋，惟法官李運騰打斷，指趙被問及簡單的問題，望趙能簡單回答，「否則我們會在這裡不知幾個世紀（we will be here for centuries）」，有人發笑。李亦指若法庭和控方有事想知，會直接發問。趙終確認，簽署相關選區的協議文件「係戴耀廷佢本身計劃嚟嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱與區諾軒成功說服戴耀廷-參與者毋須簽署協議&quot;&gt;趙稱與區諾軒成功說服戴耀廷 參與者毋須簽署協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示戴耀廷5月16日發出的「民主派35+公民投票」，戴指是「新聞稿」。文件中提及「當然我們也不會愚蠢至提供藉口給當權者去剝斷我們的基本權利」，萬德豪問意思為何？趙家賢思考數秒後稱「睇嚟係講緊投票權同參選權嘅問題」。萬追問，是否指參選人被DQ後便會失去參選權，趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，根據時間表，原本的計劃是要求參選人簽署協議，那趙是否意識到其後計劃有變，即參選人毋需再簽署任何協議？趙同意，指「當中我同戴耀廷係有一啲溝通」。他續指，當時他和區諾軒有向戴耀廷表示，若簽一份公開的文件，該文件就「好順勢」會被選舉主任檢視；而當時已開始有各方訊息知道全國人大準備通過《港區國安法》，「所以我同區諾軒會覺得，冇需要有一個簽咗嘅白紙黑字文件公開出嚟，對於參選人係一個保障嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，戴耀廷作「最終決定」並在6月9日記者會上公開說明，當時參選人「無需要簽任何協議」。李運騰問，即他和區二人成功說服戴耀廷改變想法？趙同意，並指相關新聞稿和時間表亦相繼更改。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;各區協議最終版本-除新東及新西為會運用否決權-其餘均為會積極運用&quot;&gt;各區協議最終版本 除新東及新西為「會運用」否決權 其餘均為「會積極運用」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示戴耀廷於6月8日在組織者群組發出的多個文件，包括「35+新界西final」、「35+區二final」、「35+衛生服務final」、「35+九西final」、「35+九東final」、「35+新東final」及「35+港島final」。趙確認，超區、衞生服務、九西、九東及港島均提及「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，而新東和新西則提及「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢因母親節派花缺席新西第二次會議-引助手稱已達共識全部通過會運用&quot;&gt;趙家賢因母親節派花缺席新西第二次會議 引助手稱已達共識、「全部通過『會運用』」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方今亦就新界西會議發問。新界西於5月8日晚上舉行第二次會議，趙家賢曾在會前向黎敬輝傳訊息稱「I count on you」。趙表示因會議翌日早上「我要喺太古城派鮮花康乃馨慶祝母親節」，「我唔打算出席有關會議」，故託黎幫他做筆記，黎亦有回應他「你休息吓啦，等我嚟啦」，此時在延伸庭的被告高呼「Wow！」，黃之鋒則大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在會議完結當晚約9時半，曾向黎發訊息問及會議進度，黎回應：「新西搞掂」，趙解釋是指新西協調會議已達成共識，協議亦已完成。黎翌日向趙發出會議筆記，提及戴耀廷稱「行動綱領 五大訴求 缺一不可，運用／積極運用 否決財政預算案」，黎亦寫下「全部通過 『會運用』」，並指黃偉賢稱「總結會否決財政預算案」。趙指黃為時任元朗區議會主席，戴耀廷當時找他主持新界西會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙助手留意戴耀廷會否亂講嘢-指民動未答應承辦初選戴於新西會議表示已邀請&quot;&gt;趙助手留意戴耀廷會否「亂講嘢」 指民動未答應承辦初選戴於新西會議表示已邀請&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷於會議翌日發出「35+新西final」，稱「這是協議文件」。法官陳仲衡問趙有否與戴耀廷談及該會議及文件，趙指戴於5月初邀請民主動力承辦初選，當時他回應「我哋要去考慮」；而他沒有出席5月5日的新東會議，「但我都有提我嘅助手留意戴耀廷會唔會又亂講嘢」，即在他們仍考慮時向與會者稱已邀請民主動力幫手。林卓廷等發笑，在延伸庭的袁嘉蔚亦不禁發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，故其助手有留意會上討論初選的細節，而就5月8日的新西會議，其助手和相關筆記都有反映，「戴耀廷喺冇同我確認同得到我同意嘅情況下，佢已經向咗與會者講述，邀請咗民主動力做初選」，並再透過民主動力找香港民意研究所做初選的投票系統工作。惟趙強調當時民主動力「係未回應，未應承承辦個初選」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">趙家賢：兩辦譴責初選後始讀畢〈真攬炒十步〉 指新東投票通過「會運用」否決權 趙家賢：說服戴耀廷毋須參選人簽協議 區諾軒辦初選「越嚟越變咗磨心」</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第卅六日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-31-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-36.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第卅六日】" /><published>2023-03-31T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-03-31T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-36</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-31-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-36.html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（31日）踏入審訊第36天。趙家賢今繼續作供，稱2020年4月的新界東首次協調會議上，有本土派質疑民主動力是「大台」，不希望民主動力參與協調；又指有本土派提及支持戴耀廷「攬炒」文章，戴並以比文章「溫和好多」的字眼解釋望運用《基本法》權力否決預算案，作為籌碼與中共談判，並指當選後預計任期可能只有七個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙並指，戴會上提及應要有「共同綱領」，他會收集大家意見並幫忙起草，並倡運用「積極運用」否決權字眼。惟民主黨等傳統泛民表示疑慮，鄒家成對此作出「好強烈嘅批評」，認為民意是「要選到抗爭嘅人士入到立法會，要用盡方法去迫政府回應五大訴求」，倡用更進取的「會否決」。不過趙承認，他當日開會遲到，會上亦用電腦工作，「整體嚟講係冇特別留意」會上內容。此外，在法官關注下，趙今表示其房間內仍管有本案供詞，法官要求控方安排取走。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢房間仍管有供詞-官着控方安排取走&quot;&gt;趙家賢房間仍管有供詞 官着控方安排取走&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢繼續作供。今甫開庭，法官陳仲衡便關注趙家賢的書面供詞是否已全交控方。主控萬德豪指理解所有材料應交由懲教看管，但可向證人確認，遂問趙現在仍是否管有為警方錄取的供詞。趙思考5秒後答「係」，有被告發笑。萬再問他昨天作供後有否閱讀供詞，趙答「我冇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問，本案供詞和相關文件是由懲教抑或由趙保管？趙答「喺我嘅……嗰個房間裡面」，李遂要求安排取走相關文件直至趙作供完畢，萬德豪稱會看看有什麼可以做。李再向趙指，因他正在作供，除非獲法庭許可，不得閱讀供詞協助記憶，又指這並非對他的特別對待，而是適用於所有控方證人。趙答「清楚明白，法官閣下」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官關注抗爭英譯resistance較被動&quot;&gt;法官關注「抗爭」英譯「resistance」較被動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示戴耀廷3月31日文章〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉。法官李運騰一度提出翻譯的問題，指「抗爭」被譯作「resistance」，但似乎只是譯出「抗」字，即「抵抗」，是較被動的意思；但李認為「爭」有「struggle」和「competition」的意思，較為主動，又笑言並非想打斷盤問，只是對翻譯感到不舒服。萬德豪指他並不適合提議更好的字眼。趙家賢表示，他之前有看過文章標題，亦透過一些帖文的轉發節錄看過其中兩段，「但係整體嘅文章我就冇咁樣睇過」，「我都係啱啱先睇到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑控方提問方式-官指三法官均具經驗&quot;&gt;辯方質疑控方提問方式 官指三法官均具經驗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示多則4月的WhatsApp廣播訊息，提及有關九龍西、新界東和新界西等協調會議的時間地點，惟發送者一欄均顯示為一組數字和「@broadcast」。趙家賢指是由戴耀廷透過廣播發給一眾人士包括他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師 Trevor Beel 質疑，控方一直在問問題，究竟是控方在作證抑或趙家賢在作證。李運騰指他有同樣疑問，但趙已確認過該些訊息紀錄，技術上已納為證據，至於有否證據價值只能留待控方繼續發問再決定。大律師馬維騉亦質疑，無證據證明廣播訊息發送予其他參與者，李表示明白，但指控方的問題並非證據，保證「我們三個都是很有經驗的法官，我們知道證據與問題的分別」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱414新東首次會議有本土派指民動是大台&quot;&gt;趙稱4.14新東首次會議有本土派指民動是「大台」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引訊息，顯示戴耀廷發送各個會議的資訊後，趙曾問會議是否延期，趙在控方詢問下確認新東會議依舊於4月14日舉行。李運騰指區諾軒早前已就各會議的日期作供，辯方亦沒有爭議，關注控方為何要發問，萬德豪指「法官閣下你待會就知道了」，被告席傳來「wow」。李指若開會日期不受爭議，控方可直接發問，萬稱不認為會花很多時間，又指稱「你將會知道（you will see）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示WhatsApp紀錄，其中在新東首次會議舉行的4月14日，趙家賢曾問戴耀廷當晚有多少人參與，戴有回應並發出名單。趙解釋當時想了解新東會議有什麼持分者，因不同政治光譜的團體或人士可能對如何協調、是否用初選有不同意見，「所以特別作為調解員嗰個思維，就要好好準備一啲背景資料」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認有列席新東首次會議。根據WhatsApp紀錄，民主動力總幹事黎敬輝當晚約7時向趙稱「我剛到」，趙回應指剛開完區議會會議，正在搭的士。趙解釋他當天開會遲到，故曾發訊息「叫我呢個好盡責嘅職員」幫手留意會議情況，「而我呢個麻煩嘅老細」就望他能記下會議重點。趙確認於會議中途趕至，約8時許抵達，又指因新東開會場地教協「要好準時收工，唔好阻人放工」，故會議最盡於9時半完成。趙並指，抵達後他仍以個人電腦處理區議會工作，着黎敬輝繼續幫手記錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，即他沒有留意（not paying attention）會上內容？趙指「可能有啲起哄位會留意，但係整體嚟講係冇特別留意」，指當時因為人多，各人也只是在講解自己的團體。李問即當時有熱熾的辯論？趙指當時與會者看到民主動力在場，「咁因為直接開名講民主動力，咁我會豎起隻耳仔聽」，並指本土派會覺得民主動力是「民主派嘅大台」，「因而佢哋會覺得，叫做任何協調或者做初選呢，係唔應該有民主動力嘅參與」，他亦有些回應，但不記得詳細內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎敬輝會後發給趙的訊息，提及出席者包括戴耀廷、鍾錦麟、陳志全、林卓廷代表莊榮輝和「旭」 、何桂藍、鄒家成、楊岳橋代表「豐」、郭永健和「將青力」等。趙確認鍾錦麟以西貢區議會主席身分出席，又指「將青力」是新興的本土派政治組織「將軍澳青年力量」。李運騰問，根據趙的記憶，黎敬輝有關出席者的紀錄是否準確？趙指準確。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎敬輝紀錄指戴耀廷會上提共同綱領原則迫政府解散立法會&quot;&gt;黎敬輝紀錄指戴耀廷會上提「共同綱領」原則迫政府解散立法會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息續顯示，黎指將軍澳青年力量曾提「必須有共同綱領」，而戴耀廷則提及「共同綱領原則是否決預算案，迫政府解散立法會，今次任期可能只有七個月」。李續問，知道趙在會議期間並非完全專心，那相關筆記是否與趙的記憶相符？趙指「大體係一致嘅，因為其實當時我有啲聽到覺得重要嘅嘢，但我仲係忙緊做嘢嘅時候，就同佢（黎敬輝）講呢度你記得記低」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡小休後問及黎敬輝的背景，趙指他應在中大主修社會科學或社工，社工碩士畢業，加入民主動力前曾任公民黨立法會議員助理。趙確認是他聘請黎敬輝，指民動職員於2016年請辭並物色黎，而趙與黎會面後「覺得係非常合適」，遂於翌年聘請他。趙形容黎「非常盡責，非常細心」，法官關注在摘錄紀錄上的表現如何？趙指視乎有多少時間予他準備，並指就上述新東會議的重點記錄，「好明顯見到係一種好非正式、只係將一啲重點訊息記錄落嚟」，與警方從民動辦事處搜得「嗰種好認真」的執委會會議紀錄，格式「完全唔一樣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱新東會上有本土派稱認同戴耀廷攬炒文章&quot;&gt;趙稱新東會上有本土派稱認同戴耀廷「攬炒」文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後引戴耀廷4月14日文章〈攬炒的定義和時間〉，提及攬炒的定義，「可以是指立法會被解散和特首辭職，也可以是指特區政府運作停擺，亦可以是指中共正式宣佈一國兩制結束」，又指若預算案被拒絕通過，特首可解散立法會，而由於法案一般在5月表決，故最早出現解散立法會的時機是新一屆立法會會期開始後大概7個多月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同樣表示從來沒有看過整篇文章，但記得4月14日新東會議上戴耀廷有作介紹，指當時應有與會者提及「啊戴教授你好似喺《蘋果》度有篇文章，我支持你睇法喎」，惟趙指「其實唔係個個人有睇《蘋果日報》、或者專登好似粉絲咁睇住戴耀廷嘅文章」，故戴當時提及他寫了上述文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，戴在會上解釋時，是用比該文章「溫和好多」的字眼，大意是想使用《基本法》賦予立法會的權力否決財政預算案，可作為籌碼與中共談判，又指因此「大家預咗當選嘅話，都可能做得嗰七個月㗎咋」。趙同意上述內容是其本人的記憶，非從黎敬輝的筆記而來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在法官李運騰詢問下同意，戴會上承認文章由他所寫，並順帶提及文章內容，並指因此會上有討論應用「會運用」抑或「會積極運用」《基本法》賦予立法會的權力。法官李運騰問誰提及該文章，趙指「抱歉，法官閣下我真係記唔到」，在追問下只記得是男性本土抗爭派人士。法官陳仲衡問，展示黎敬輝的訊息會否能協助他，趙指「感謝法官閣下搵方法去協助本人記憶」，何桂藍發笑，趙並指「但我嗰陣時應該係有聽到有人咁講，但雙眼係望緊螢幕做區議會工作」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指若趙不記得就是不記得，但問該人提及文章時，是表示支持還是反對？趙重申是表示認同。萬德豪續問及有關「會積極運用」字眼的爭議，趙指當時戴提及進行協調如民意調查或初選，應要有「共同綱領」，而他會收集大家意見再幫手起草，並另外發給有關人士，戴並提倡要「積極運用《基本法》賦予立法會嘅權力，包括否決財政預算案」，「帶出咗呢個嘅方向出嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指鄒家成會上對傳統民主派顧慮有好強烈批評&quot;&gt;趙指鄒家成會上對傳統民主派顧慮有「好強烈批評」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，當時傳統泛民主派政黨如民主黨曾表示疑慮，指「難道起醫院、起學校嘅撥款都反對？」，他形容會上有「少少火花」，「好記得本案嘅被告之一，鄒家成，佢就對於傳統民主派嘅依啲顧慮作出好強烈嘅批評」，指鄒認為「民意」是「要選到抗爭嘅人士入到立法會，要用盡方法去迫政府回應五大訴求」，故字眼上應用「更進取」的「會否決」。鄒聞言低頭抄寫，沒有特別反應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LXqYA2f.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒早前提及，相關討論是在第二次協調會議發生。法官李運騰問，趙記得上述對話是在4月14日會議，抑或其他場合發生？趙望前方螢幕靜默近20秒，並答「我而家嘅記憶，就係應該喺呢個會議都有講到呢個訊息」，並補充在之後的會議都有繼續討論相關事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示WhatsApp紀錄，顯示戴耀廷於會議兩日後，曾發出下次新東會議的時間地點，並提及「討論文件」，附件為「35+新東.docx」。控方指未能擷取該文件，問趙對此有否任何印象？趙稱不太有印象，因當時他收到但沒有下載。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AfcaU3q.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（31日）踏入審訊第36天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢今繼續作供，指戴耀廷在初選討論未達共識、無獲明確授權下，已撰寫「煽動性」和「好似預言家」的文章，如「民主派全港唯一領導人」般，稱民主派將否決預算案和以「攬炒」迫使中共，「我睇到呢啲字眼，我係好火滾」，批其行為自負和不負責任。趙又指，若承辦初選前有仔細看清戴的言論，「咁我好深信，我同民主動力都不會同意承辦初選」，批戴「同中央、同政府『頂到行』」，絕非民主動力多年協調初選的「初心」。此外，控方就戴耀廷在台灣《蘋果日報》文章提問時，法官李運騰一度笑言自己不看《蘋果》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴協調期間撰煽動性文章&quot;&gt;趙稱戴協調期間撰「煽動性」文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案發時任民主動力召集人趙家賢繼續作供。控方展示戴耀廷2020年4月20日文章〈香港攬炒大對決〉，提及「民主派現正密鑼緊鼓部署9月的立法會選舉，希望奪取一半議席。民主派明言若能成功，在明年就會否決財政預算案，到時立法會有可能被解散，特區政府也可能停擺。民主派的策略是以『攬炒』去迫使中共及特區政府就『反送中』所提出的五大訴求作讓步。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙表示他沒有看過文章，「但我想有啲嘢想即時講講」，指文章發布時戴在各區協調會議有帶出他自己或民間的一些建議，即否決財政預算案，而趙的概括認知是民主陣營有不同政治光譜，有人「好支持呢種做法」、傳統民主派則「有疑問」，當時仍在討論當中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，「而戴耀廷喺呢個協調嘅時候，佢寫一啲咁樣煽動性、同埋好似預言家嘅文章」，尤其是「民主派明言若能成功，在明年就會否決財政預算案」、「民主派的策略是以『攬炒』去迫使中共」兩句，「整段呢啲訊息，根本佢冇獲得任何嘅清楚明確嘅授權。我而家第一次睇到呢篇文章，我睇到呢啲字眼，我係好火滾 」，趙提到「好火滾」時身體微微振動，鄒家成發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指事前若看清戴耀廷發言-好深信民動不會同意承辦初選&quot;&gt;趙指事前若看清戴耀廷發言 「好深信」民動不會同意承辦初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續不忿指，戴根本在未有處理好所有人的共識下，「佢都已經好似係民主派全港唯一領導人，就講民主派會咁做啦，完全係一個自負、不負責任嘅行為」，此時林卓廷笑出聲，鄒家成亦微微向前俯身發笑，旁聽席有人說「痴線」。趙續指，對他和民主動力而言，「我欠缺咗一個盡職審查嘅責任，如果當時5月底我同意做承辦初選之前，如果我同我組織成員有仔細睇返清楚戴耀廷咁多嘅呢啲文章嘅發言，咁我好深信，我同民主動力都不會同意承辦初選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VlJfZRP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 林卓廷（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指如他昨天提及，辦初選的初心就是「希望協助民主派立法會攞過半議席，取得主導權」，可推動一些「利民為港」的政策，並要求政府回應五大訴求，強調「並唔係用佢文章依一個角度、係去用一種『攬炒』嘅字眼，去迫中共特區政府係作出讓步」，而是透過議會架構和現行機制反映民意。惟趙指，「戴耀廷好明顯，佢已經好躁動地，係透過民主派去參選去攞過半議席，就係同中央、同政府『頂到行』，依個絕對不是民主動力過往多年嚟進行協調初選嘅初心」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意協調會議對戴耀廷看法無共識-情況如拔河&quot;&gt;趙同意協調會議對戴耀廷看法無共識 情況如「拔河」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續問，趙2020年時是否《蘋果日報》的讀者，趙指當時《蘋果日報》要訂閱，又指他當時「真係太多行政事務」，除了為民主動力做選民登記，還有東區區議會作為副主席的行政事務，以及作為太古城區議員的地區事務，「坦白講，係唔會所有文章都會睇晒 」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，故撇除趙家賢對戴耀廷的個人想法，他作為證人的證供，是否指上文表達有關民主派的目標和策略，並非任何協調會議的共識？趙指，當時協調會議上傳統民主派政黨「係有表達擔憂嘅」，強調當時「仲係繼續協調中！」。李運騰再指，故趙觀察即戴耀廷的看法在會上並非沒有支持者？趙同意，陳仲衡再指，即有如「拔河（tug of war）」，趙點頭說：「好準確呀法官閣下。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷文章於台灣蘋果日報發布-官望控方預先表明-指因自己不看蘋果&quot;&gt;戴耀廷文章於台灣《蘋果日報》發布 官望控方預先表明 指因自己不看《蘋果》&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續向萬德豪指，此前已多次表明若向證人展示文章，應先問他有沒有看過，因若證人沒看過，發問是沒有意思。萬德豪指趙或看過文章部分內容，惟陳仲衡指這篇趙就沒有看過，萬回應只是第一次，林卓廷發笑。資深大律師潘熙補充，文章是發表於台灣《蘋果日報》，並非香港《蘋果日報》，惟萬德豪指文章在香港也可看到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，若文章並非在香港發布，望萬德豪能在一開始表明，微笑指「因為我不看《蘋果日報》，所以我並不清楚（Because I don’t read Apple, so I simply do not know）」，柯耀林等發笑。陳慶偉並指，文章是《蘋果日報》的電子版，認為能在世界各處讀到，此時柯耀林、吳政亨和鄒家成等討論，萬德豪重申警方是在香港下載該文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指本案攬炒有三個譯法-包括laam-chow&quot;&gt;控方指本案「攬炒」有三個譯法 包括「laam chow」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬其後展示戴耀廷4月21日文章〈攬炒的時代意義〉，萬德豪此次先表明是來自香港的《蘋果日報》，陳志全等人笑出聲。法官陳仲衡關注，文章標題英譯為「laam chow」，萬指本案中「攬炒」有三種譯法，分別為「mutual destruction」、「mutual sabotage」和「laam chow」，陳慶偉一度發笑。控方續引文章「很多港人的心態已轉化，準備來一次真正的攬炒，決心要死而後生」等，趙指有看過文章標題，並從Facebook轉發帖文節錄看過其中一句。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱戴耀廷在否決權上傾向本土抗爭派嗰邊&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱戴耀廷在否決權上「傾向本土抗爭派嗰邊」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢今早就新界東首次會議作供，指戴耀廷稱望以否決預算案作為籌碼與中共談判，預計當選後任期只有7個月，鄒家成並對傳統民主派作出「好強烈批評」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方下午續就香港島和新界西的情況發問。主控萬德豪展示戴耀廷的WhatsApp廣播訊息，提及2020年4月23日舉行新界西會議，並於會議舉行兩日後發訊息指下次會議在5月8日舉行，戴並稱「這是下次會議討論的文件，希望能表達得到大家最有機會達成共識的想法。或許這建議未必是大家最想見到的方案，但希望大家在這艱難局面，盡可能達成共識，相信這也是支持我們的選民的期望。大家若認為文件仍有不足，也希望大家能參與下次會議，一起來討論怎樣去改善它」，附件為「35+新西.docx」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問有否出席新西會議，趙稱能夠肯定沒有出席5月8日會議，至於4月23日會議則稱「我應該有出席」。李再問趙有否下載上述附件，趙指「而家警方攞得到呢個初稿出嚟，我就應該係有下載嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱本土派與傳統泛民就否決權討論有拉扯&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱本土派與傳統泛民就否決權討論有「拉扯」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示該份題為「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新西協調機制（初稿）」的附件，提及「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」。被問會上有否討論該條款，趙指印象中戴有提過「民意」要求用否決權迫政府回應五大訴求，而當時「本土抗爭派同傳統民主派都就住個議題有一個拉扯」，因此戴發初稿時亦有表明未必是大家最想見到的方案。趙續指認為戴作為會議協調人，是有「挨向」運用基本法否決權的方向。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，在「會積極運用」和「會運用」字眼，戴是傾向哪方？趙指戴初稿是用了「會積極運用」字眼。法官陳仲衡再問，在想運用否決權和有保留的兩方，趙想指戴傾向哪一方？趙答「佢傾向本土抗爭派嗰邊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡指，文件顯示「會積極運用」而非「會運用」字眼，這是否反映戴偏向抗爭派的立場？趙指「法官閣下，喺我角度我覺得係有嘅」，指因戴若有保留的話，「佢應該要釐清有關政權嘅一啲關注」，惟戴在草稿中已將會運用否決權字眼加上去，「如果未傾得完全大方向同意嘅話，喺我作為做調解員嘅操守當中，其實係完全成句係唔應該出現嘅」，鄒家成和林卓廷發笑。陳仲衡問，故在拔河中，戴是站在本土抗爭派那邊？趙同意這是他當時觀察到的情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問有否出席港島會議-趙家賢一度指記憶模糊後稱應該係有出席&quot;&gt;被問有否出席港島會議 趙家賢一度指記憶模糊後稱「應該係有出席」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於港島區，WhatsApp紀錄顯示2020年4月17日第二次港島會議後，趙家賢翌日早上曾向戴耀廷查詢出席者名單，稱「有啲樣我會搞錯咗」，戴回覆的名單顯示有趙家賢名字。主控萬德豪問趙有否出席會議，趙靜默約15秒後稱有出席，但指看訊息後「都有少少模糊，因為我係用呢個圖象記憶嘅思維……」，林卓廷說「吓」，亦有被告發笑，趙並指訊息「字面上睇」，就應該指他當晚有出席會議，「但係有一啲新面孔我唔認得」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，他是否不肯定有否出席？趙稱「我而家思考緊」，林卓廷大笑。李運騰並指現時離會議近三年，理論上趙當時的記憶會較準確，陳慶偉亦指若趙沒有出席，當時看到自己名單出席在名單上應會很驚訝。趙在控方和法官澄清下，終表示根據訊息，「我應該係有出席個會議嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意否決預算案非港島會議討論重點區諾軒無參與否決權討論&quot;&gt;趙同意否決預算案非港島會議討論重點、區諾軒無參與否決權討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;與早前的會議一樣，趙家賢拜託民主動力總幹事黎敬輝幫忙記錄港島會議。控方展示黎於會議翌日凌晨近4時發送予趙家賢的重點筆記，提及會議出席者包括戴耀廷、徐子見、羅冠聰、楊雪盈、羅健熙、區諾軒、鄭達鴻、周世傑和南區區議會副主席司馬文；亦列出會上討論事項，包括Plan B和投票機制。萬德豪問記錄是否與趙的記憶吻合？趙指「剛剛你向我展示返有關呢啲資料嘅時候，我發覺討論係我都有印象」，但補充當天沒有全程出席會議，「遲咗去，早咗走」，逗留約1小時。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qo0CHt6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄭達鴻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在紀錄指，區諾軒會上提及「讓區議員知道選舉形勢不樂觀，要有戰意鬥志，否決財政預算案」。萬問趙當時有否聽過區這樣說，趙指「印象係冇聽過」，但不能肯定，林卓廷皺眉。趙並解釋，因司馬文說英文，故當天會上坐在他身旁翻譯討論重點。在法官詢問下，他指沒有印象有譯過區該句說話，「但反而我好有印象，司馬文係講過佢個人係反對否決財政預算案」，而戴則簡單回應其建議是根據《基本法》賦予的權力，其後該議題就被其他討論「蓋過咗」，黎亦因此沒有作紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，故筆記上唯一提及否決預算案只是上述區諾軒的話，而其他討論則沒有記載。趙重申這是黎開會後「一個好快嘅重點筆記紀錄」。李指，因此否決預算案議題並非會上重要的議題？趙同意，亦同意會上很多時間是花在討論替補機制、投票系統和投1票抑或4票，即初選的行攻工作。陳慶偉續問，戴耀廷在3月至5月嘗試在協調會議推動否決預算案，而戴和區諾軒又是「共同組織者（co-organizers）」，那在趙在場的會議中，區諾軒有參與否決預算案的討論嗎？趙答「回應法官閣下，喺我記憶所及，並沒有嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙家賢今早稱仍管有其書面供詞，法官陳仲衡臨散庭前提醒控方安排取走，萬德豪指已作出相關安排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（30日）踏入審訊第35天。趙家賢今繼續作供，提及戴耀廷以九龍東為初選協調試點，而區諾軒於2020年2月邀請民主動力參與九東協調，趙認為民動有辦民主派初選的經驗，遂代表民動接受邀請，列席協調會議提供意見。趙表示，戴耀廷和區諾軒是直至5月初才具體邀請民動承辦初選，因民動在3月至5月獲資深傳媒人蕭若元贊助舉行選民登記活動，蕭望透過選民登記，取得批發及零售界、飲食界及進出口界功能組別議席。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 各獲准保釋被告早上到庭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱2004年立會協調失敗-其後民主派就選舉協調有不同意見&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱2004年立會協調失敗 其後民主派就選舉協調有不同意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢今繼續作供。趙表示在2020年頭，戴耀廷就立會過半達致35+的民意，曾撰寫很多文章和做訪問，開始推動其計劃。趙指，立法會選舉奉行比例代表制，與區議會小選區、單議席單票制的協調和選出效果有很大分別，而民動過往曾進行立會選舉協調，如2004年新東立會選舉曾組成「鑽石名單」，望集中票源在同一名單讓多位現任議員連任，但選舉結果證明失敗，因有排名單較後的現任議員因剩餘票數不足而落選，故其後泛民主派就立會選舉的協調如何處理有不同意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱2020年前民動在立會選舉推動選民登記和做民調&quot;&gt;趙稱2020年前民動在立會選舉推動選民登記和做民調&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問及「35+」的意思，趙指當時整個形勢望在70席的立會取得過半數，故戴耀廷在2020年頭開始周圍聯絡不同政黨、政團、新興組織和政治素人。趙指，戴聯絡了九龍東區議會的正副主席，並開始與有意參選者「一齊坐低傾」，討論如何透過協調減少整個民主陣營在選舉的「衝撞」，集中票源讓每區有最多民主派當選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問民主動力為何會參與「35+」，趙解釋2004年協調失敗後，民動領導層和各主要參與協調的民主派政黨，在之後數屆立會選舉均「冇一個好正式嘅協調」，由各政黨各自參選；而民動則會聯同各政黨推出選民登記活動，到了2016年，更邀請香港民意研究所在提名期及投票日前進行民意調查。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪指希望趙能集中在「35+」，法官李運騰指理解趙在談及民動此前在立會選舉的工作，但認為趙可直接談及2020年的情況。李後總結趙是指2020年前民動角色是推動選民登記和做民調，趙答「冇錯嘅法官大人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱區諾軒邀請民動參與九東協調-望由九東較細選區開始&quot;&gt;趙稱區諾軒邀請民動參與九東協調 望由九東較細選區開始&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，明顯地2020年民動角色不同了，問民動是如何參與「35+」？趙答「我盡快去講，知道個重點嘅」，指2020年民動原本繼續以往工作，但戴耀廷想與九東進行討論，故當時區諾軒及九東區議會的正副主席就邀請民動一起參與討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，區諾軒在2月初邀請民動參與，區指戴耀廷望推動官方選舉前的協調，並望以初選形式處理。區並指，戴當然希望全港五大地方選區一起進行，但因就協調有不同意見，故「希望喺九龍東呢個比較細嘅地方選區開始傾先」，望九東「傾到個方向」後，就可進一步在其他選區繼續傾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在法官詢問下表示，九東只有兩個區議會，分別為黃大仙及觀塘，而時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻，及時任黃大仙區議會副主席黃逸旭是九東群組的管理員，他們並無政治聯繫，是獨立支持民主的議員。趙並補充，區當時提及「地區上」都邀請他參與討論，指的就是區議會正副主席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱民動角色分享1718年補選初選經驗-戴區二人5月初才具體邀民動辦初選&quot;&gt;趙稱民動角色分享17、18年補選初選經驗 戴區二人5月初才具體邀民動辦初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問趙家賢當時的回應，趙提及2017年底至2018年頭，因青年新政兩議員被「遞（應為褫）」奪議席，故九西及新東需進行補選，「當時係由我，以及民主動力去全權處理」協調民主派及本土派，並達成共識就補選進行民主派初選，亦有地區票站及選舉論壇。趙指，因此民動在九東的討論中是合適的角色去提供意見，並代表民主動力接受區的邀請，列席九東會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪再問民主動力在「35+計劃」的角色，趙指當時是代表民動分享在2017和2018年補選的民主派初選經驗，以讓與會者參考在2020年選舉中是否用初選形式進行。趙又指，當時民動尚未答應、其他參與者亦未同意辦初選，「個討論未去到呢度」，並指待戴耀廷和區諾軒在不同區的會議展開商討後，「我係去到5月初左右，先至好具體係由佢哋兩位作出邀請，去承辦個初選嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱2020年社會民意望民主派立會過半&quot;&gt;趙稱2020年社會民意望民主派立會過半&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙解釋，因為在2020年3月至5月頭，民動獲得「資深傳媒人蕭若元」的贊助推行選民登記活動，解釋當時「整個社會嘅民意都希望立法會可以過半」。陳仲衡問是由泛民取得過半？趙指會用「民主陣營」字眼，指「民主陣營」下包括傳統泛民主派、進步民主派、本土派和抗爭派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ATYtf7O.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 民動於2020年3月23日舉行記者會，稱獲蕭若元贊助，組織民主派的十八區區議員作選民登記行動&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問趙為何說社會上有此民意，笑言明顯社會上不是每人都是泛民主派。趙指「多謝法官閣下」，解釋應是支持民主陣營的市民望可在立會過半，取得主導權，並指區選大勝後，很多區議員在地區工作開街站，也會收到很多市民意見，「我想表達唔淨係透過傳媒或者網上嘅討論，而其實喺我哋叫『在地』，喺地區上實在地都係聽到相關嘅意見。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱蕭若元2020年贊助民動辦選民登記-望取得3功能組別議席&quot;&gt;趙稱蕭若元2020年贊助民動辦選民登記 望取得3功能組別議席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就蕭若元的贊助，趙指當時民主陣營若要爭立會過半，「技術上係有一啲嘅困難同工作需要處理」。他指，戴耀廷本身預計五大地方選區可取得「6 6 4 4 3」共23個議席，即需另取得13席才能過半數。當時泛民在部分傳統功能組別議席較「穩妥」，包括法律界、會計界、資訊科技界、教育界、社會福利界、衞生服務界，另超級區議會亦應能獲得3席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙並指，因此需要找方法選到其他功能組別議席，「先至可以夾埋35+嘅效果」。趙指當時「蕭若元前輩」提及批發及零售界、飲食界及進出口界3個界別，特別希望該3個界別可透過他贊助下，加大新增選民登記的效果，透過新選民讓民主派從建制派手中取得該些議席。趙並指，他與「蕭若元前輩」提出只做功能組別選民登記是有困難，認為應全港民主派區議員幫手，地方選區與功能組別同時做，指能提升香港民主。蕭同意，故由民動協調進行選民登記。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問，蕭望在該3個界別爭取支持，是民主陣營的秘密抑或廣為人知？趙指蕭有在網上一些節目提及。李運騰問為何要知道關於蕭的事情，萬德豪答是與民主陣營能否取得更多功能組別議席有關。惟陳慶偉認為不需相關證據，李運騰亦指除非功能組別選民登記是「35+計劃」的一部分，否則認為與案的相關性很低。萬續就另一議題發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（30日）踏入審訊第35天。趙家賢繼續作供，稱2020年2月受區諾軒邀請參與九龍東初選協調，庭上展示九東WhatsApp群組的紀錄，顯示早前被指為共謀者之一、前觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻是群組管理員，曾為會議找場地，亦曾替戴耀廷轉發會議摘要。法官問蔡是否會議的組織者，趙形容他是「好資深嘅議員」、「好好心、好幫手嘅大義工」，不認為他是組織者。趙亦強調，會議並非由民主動力召開，只是幫手聯絡傳統民主政黨；又指民主動力的「初心」一直是協助民主陣營集中票源爭取最多議席，而協調會議初期重點非否決權，戴耀廷是在後期才更着重討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙強調會議並非由民主動力召開-只是幫手聯絡傳統民主政黨&quot;&gt;趙強調會議並非由民主動力召開 只是幫手聯絡傳統民主政黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢作供提及，2020年2月初獲區諾軒邀請參與九東協調並列席會議，民動角色是提供意見。控方庭上展示從趙家賢手機檢取的「35+九東立選座談會」WhatsApp 紀錄，顯示群組由戴耀廷於2020年2月13日創立，群組管理員為時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻和黃大仙區議會副主席黃逸旭，成員包括區諾軒、戴耀廷、許錦成、施德來、莫劍成、黃之鋒、譚文豪、胡志偉、譚得志和蘇浩。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據紀錄，蔡澤鴻2月25日發訊息提及3月2日九東開會的資訊；而民動職員黎敬輝同日私訊趙家賢，提及上述會議資訊，控方指似是邀請「Jeremy」出席會議，趙指是「譚文豪」。趙其後回應「I whatsapped him lar」，指他已將訊息發給譚。趙補充，上述訊息由黎草擬，黎平時也會起草稿予他參考，而趙記得有跟黎說，「個會議並不是由民主動力去召開嘅」，並在法官詢問下重申，「個會議嘅發起召集，並不是民主動力」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，趙強調會議非由民動召開，那若組織者望邀請譚文豪，為何不自己邀請，要民動邀請？趙指，當時民動獲邀參與會議時，蔡澤鴻或戴耀廷曾提及想邀請各方人士，而因民動過往獲傳統民主派政黨授權做協調和交流，故趙指民主動力可幫手聯絡傳統民主政黨。趙並指，對誰將譚文豪加入群組沒有印象，但同意群組管理員及建立者也可加入成員。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 蔡澤鴻（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指蔡澤鴻是好好心的大義工-不認同是會議組織者&quot;&gt;趙指蔡澤鴻是好好心的「大義工」 不認同是會議組織者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問，趙家賢是否認為蔡澤鴻是會議的組織者？趙答「佢係一個好、好心去幫手嘅大義工」，李指不是說蔡是否受薪，而是問是否視蔡為會議的組織者，趙答「我不會」。李指但蔡是群組管理員？趙指正如剛才所述，「佢係一個好好心、好幫手嘅大義工」，因他在九東是「好資深嘅議員」，故「主要幫埋戴耀廷去管理個群組」。李問蔡也有提供開會場地？趙同意，指蔡有幫手找地方開會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示紀錄，顯示2月13日，蔡澤鴻提及「有『會議室』可用」，黃逸旭問「咁3月3日去蔡主席會議室？」。兩日後區諾軒再問哪天開會，戴耀廷說「照舊3月2日吧」。趙確認，首次會議於3月2日順安邨安逸樓地下會議室進行，但並非蔡澤鴻的會議室，而是蔡借來的場地，而2月25日蔡提及「如果大家唔介意，我會定出討論事項，供大家參考」，控方問訊息顯示討論事項由蔡定出？趙答「就咁睇嘅意思係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蔡澤鴻轉發戴耀廷文件-趙指蔡為好資深區議員故戴倚靠他助傳訊息&quot;&gt;蔡澤鴻轉發戴耀廷文件 趙指蔡為好資深區議員故戴倚靠他助傳訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據WhatsApp紀錄，譚得志和蘇浩均於3月5日被加入該群組。同日蔡澤鴻發出「35+九東.docx」，指「戴教授做咗會議摘要比大家傳閱」，胡志偉回覆「請大家細心閱讀」。被問是否知道附件是什麼，趙指根據訊息就是會議摘要，但沒有太大印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，文件由戴耀廷準備，為何由蔡澤鴻發出？趙指記得戴曾提及，因九東是各區第一個協調會議，而他認知蔡澤鴻是「好資深嘅地區議員」，故起初就訊息傳遞上，「會係倚靠蔡議員去協助」，紀錄亦顯示該附件是蔡澤鴻由戴耀廷處轉發。李問趙有否直接從戴收到該文件，趙指未能完全確定，重申戴將不同人加入群組名單，會按不同區轉發文件，也可能有不同版本。就此文件，他不能確認有否看過或有認知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢首次九西會議遲到半小時-確認黃碧雲代表賴仁彪余德寶李傲然等出席&quot;&gt;趙家賢首次九西會議遲到半小時 確認黃碧雲代表、賴仁彪、余德寶、李傲然等出席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;紀錄其後顯示，蔡澤鴻在3月15日發訊息提及下次九東會議的時間地點，而同日黎敬輝向趙發訊息提及九西將於3月24日進行首次會議。大律師沈士文質疑控方提問方式，認為若趙家賢沒有要求協助記憶，並不應展示相關紀錄，認為提問方式很奇怪。李運騰指明白傳聞證供的問題，但視乎控方如何使用證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後繼續就各WhatsApp紀錄發問，顯示黎敬輝在九西會議舉行的3月24日晚上7時許，曾問趙會否出席，趙說「coming」，黎並指「而家林建文開始」。黎其後於8時05分發訊息列出與會者名字，趙解釋他當日區議會要開會，故由助手先去，他遲了約半小時到達，而其助手告知他有誰出席，「佢係一個好好嘅僱員」，庭上傳來笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指李傲然九西會上提及較進取用盡議會權力-惟相關討論其後冇咗蹤影&quot;&gt;趙指李傲然九西會上提及較進取用盡議會權力 惟相關討論其後「冇咗蹤影」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據訊息，黃碧雲當日由代表出席，劉偉聰與其助手亦在場，亦提及何啟明和代表David Chu。趙指記得David Chu在場，何啟明則不太記得，但照寫法應在場。訊息亦提到公民黨副主席「Bill」賴仁彪、公民黨油尖旺區議會副主席余德寶，以及油尖旺區議員李傲然有出席，趙指李是剛當選的政治素人，在網上非建制陣營中有知名度和會發聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4LmVYTz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 李傲然（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙並指，去到時與會者正重點討論如何能在初選機制穩固選票，屬「確保勝算」的事務。他記得李傲然「有比較上進取去講覺得要用盡議會嘅一啲權力」，但再之後有其他討論，「令到有關嘅討論好似冇咗蹤影」。趙並確認，兩日後收到戴耀廷發出「35+九西」文件，題為「35＋立會過半計劃 民主派九西協調機制（初稿）」，提及「會積極運用立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙出席首次港島會議後不肯定有否收文件-但確認戴68發出最後版本協調文件&quot;&gt;趙出席首次港島會議後不肯定有否收文件 但確認戴6.8發出最後版本協調文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;香港島於3月26日舉行協調會議，趙家賢當天向黎敬輝轉發區諾軒有關港島首次會議的訊息，黎於7時40分指「區軒開始」，趙稱「Ok, coming」並要求黎記錄重點。趙解釋，「好明顯係因為我趕唔切去開嗰個會，所以我就要求佢去先」，並望助手幫忙將討論重點紀錄。趙最終於約8時抵達，會議於9時半至10時完結，黎其後向趙發出會議重點簡要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問趙之後有否收到任何有關會議的文件？趙指要看紀錄，「因為真係收到太多文件」。至於有沒有從區諾軒處收到，他指沒有印象，但區諾軒主力港島協調會議，「我深信佢同相關喺香港島參與協調會議嘅人有好充分嘅溝通」。至於有沒有從戴耀廷收到文件，趙指就當天會議不敢肯定，但6月9日正式公布初選的記者會前，他曾要求戴耀廷將所有區的最後版本協調文件主動發出，戴並於6月8日發出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢指民動初心是辦初選-助民主陣營爭取議席&quot;&gt;趙家賢指民動初心是辦初選 助民主陣營爭取議席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方亦引戴耀廷3月3日〈反制警察政權就要立會奪半〉文章，提及根據《基本法》，兩次否決預算案後特首必須辭職，「換句話說，立會若能奪半，反對陣營就會多了一個重要政治籌碼，就是以威脅否決整份預算案來換取特區政府在某些方面讓步。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢表示，有看過文章的標題和製圖，但整篇文章內文「我其實係啱啱頭先先至睇嘅，而頭先嗰段都係啱啱先至仔細睇到」。趙指，從戴耀廷公開講話宣傳，可知道他着重立會過半後運用《基本法》賦予立法會的憲制權利，與政府作出談判，「呢個係協調嘅一啲會議，叫做開頭嘅大半之前嘅認知」。趙續指到了協調會議中後期，就更加具體聽到戴耀廷及與會者「好着重去講要使用《基本法》賦予立法會嘅權力」，即過半後使用否決權，「而否決財政預算案係一個好好嘅政治籌碼同政府去談判」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，不太理解趙指協調會議「開頭大半」，是指特定一個會議，抑或整體的協調會議，趙指「抱歉法官閣下，講得唔清楚，係整體嘅協調會議」。趙續指，因本身民主動力就初選的理解，「我哋不嬲個初心就係做一個初選，係協助民主陣營喺官方選舉裡面能夠集中票源爭取最多嘅議席」，而若取得過半議席，即取得議會主導權，民主派過往建議的利民政策倡議，就可得到具體推動和實行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢指協調會議後期戴耀廷強調用否決權-指是好好嘅政治籌碼與政府談判&quot;&gt;趙家賢指協調會議後期戴耀廷強調用否決權 指是「好好嘅政治籌碼」與政府談判&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問及趙參與協調會議的時間，趙確認他首次出席是3月2日的九東協調會議，至於最後一次何時出席，趙則沉默數秒未有回答。陳慶偉其後總結各區的協調會議時間，趙指沒有全部出席，有部分是由總幹事或兼職職員代為出席。而他本人有親身出席九東第一和第二次會議，出席的最後一次會議應是5月5日新東會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉遂問，趙的印象是否指否決權在最初的會議並非重點，但到了後期則由戴耀廷討論和強調？趙指「確認嘅法官閣下」，補充九東首兩次會議對是否舉行初選未有共識，反而提議用退選，即投票日時按民調狀況由支持度過低的團隊退選，亦有討論替補機制。趙並無出席九東第三次會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tobRjdc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（30日）踏入審訊第35天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢繼續作供，表示事前對戴耀廷3月召開的首個初選記招並不知情，民主動力「完全排除在外、完全冇角色」，而民動在正式加入計劃前已發文談初選和立會過半，是為了在網上「吸like」，亦同意法官指是避免「尷尬」和不想民主動力「企埋一邊」。趙又指，有「使命感」協調民主派出選，稱若之後協調工作全由戴耀廷「做晒」，「民主動力係壽終正寢，係唔需要有任何工作。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，於2020年5月中下旬答應承辦初選，當時他要求戴耀廷承諾由民主動力「全權處理同控制」初選運作，戴「『口輕輕』答係冇問題」，惟趙稱之後初選流程有很多變異，「我相信之後主控會帶領我去講出嚟」，有被告聞言低聲起哄。趙亦批評，戴在民動未答應時已向其他人指已邀請他們，是「只講事實嘅部分」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱看直播才知道326初選記者會-民主動力事前無收過邀請&quot;&gt;趙稱看直播才知道3.26初選記者會 民主動力事前無收過邀請&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第二名控方證人、民主動力召集人趙家賢繼續作供。他今出入法庭時均向法官及主控官點頭，主控萬德豪亦曾點頭回應。趙於作供期間曾提及至少30次「法官閣下」，亦曾提及「主控官閣下」，並在法官提問或糾正時說「多謝法官閣下」、「多謝主控同埋法官嘅問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷與區諾軒於2020年3月26日召開「立會過半」記者會，是就初選召開的首個記者會。主控萬德豪問及，趙是否得知當天有記者會，趙指「我當時睇直播知道」，亦清楚聽到戴提及否決財政預算案是「大殺傷力憲制武器」。李運騰問這是否戴首次使用該字眼，趙指「當時聽直播先知道」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 戴耀廷與區諾軒等人於2020年3月26日召開「立會過半」記者會&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙並指，當時是從新聞軟件彈出的提示，得知該記者會有直播，「然後㩒出嚟睇」，萬德豪問即是純粹巧合（by chance）？惟大律師沈士文質疑趙已經回答，控方要接受。法官陳慶偉不接納，沈士文說他不是要提出反對，只是想說做法很危險，萬續要求趙想清楚才回答（think carefully before you answer）。趙重申是從電話新聞彈出的提示得知有記者會，但指他記憶有處模糊，不清楚當時會否有其他職員、或有民主動力委員或其他政界人士叫他去看。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱民動被記者會完全排除在外-翌日發文只是吸like避免尷尬&quot;&gt;趙稱民動被記者會「完全排除在外」 翌日發文只是「吸like」、避免尷尬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示民主動力於3月27日的Facebook 帖文，轉發同案被告朱凱廸對〈【基本法30年】譚耀宗：倘泛民議會過半觸發憲政危機 中央勢出手〉一文的回應。被問帖文由誰轉發，趙指「真係唔記得」，但指「唔係我就係總幹事」。趙續指，3月26日記者會的陣容是「重量級」，不同版塊、功能組別、專業界別的立法會議員，都陪同戴耀廷和區諾軒出席記者會，惟其實「我哋民主動力係冇人收到任何邀請」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再問，趙是否事前不知道有此記者會？趙答「係嘅法官閣下」，並指在該記者會前或後曾向區諾軒了解，獲告知原來當時就9月立會選舉的民主陣營協調工作，戴耀廷是獲得「民主派元老嘅充分支持」，「即係民主動力喺當時嚟講，係絕對冇獲得授權做任何協調嘅角色」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，「我哋當然之後要了解吓各方面嘅情況係點樣」，而該Facebook帖文，就是讓公眾看到民主動力「都叫做好似喺呢件事度係有跟進到」，又指「其實只係網上嘅做法，叫做係『吸like』，變咗公眾唔會知道，其實民主動力喺當時嘅記者會，係完全排除在外、係完全冇角色。」此時鄒家成發笑。李運騰續問，此舉是否可以避免趙感覺尷尬（to save you from some embarrassment）？趙答：「法官閣下形容得好準確」，庭上傳出笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪其後展示朱凱廸的帖文，提及「香港民主派在議會過半，代表香港人選擇與中共攤牌」。萬問這是否民主動力的看法？趙答「並不是嘅」，重申如上所說，就着記者會當時發生的事，「我哋完全排除在外、冇參與到」，而當時朱凱廸文章「好似比較上將一啲重點講咗出嚟」，但又不完全是民主動力的看法和意思，故採用轉發帖文的形式。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;未加入初選仍發文-趙指民動有使命感-若全由戴耀廷做晒會壽終正寢&quot;&gt;未加入初選仍發文 趙指民動有「使命感」 若全由戴耀廷「做晒」會「壽終正寢」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後主動提起民主動力3月19日一則Facebook帖文，「民主動力：有關立法會協調工作及回應民間要求初選安排的意見」，文中表示要回應社會對「光復立法會」協調工作的關注，提及民主動力受邀參與九東協調會議，九東同意以棄選機制作協調。趙確認文章是由民動職員起草，再由他修訂發出。李運騰再問，趙家賢發文時，是否知悉約一星期後會有上述記者會？趙指「我冇特別收到通知法官閣下」，解釋該帖文是民主動力就民間要求有初選安排，及就立會選舉協調工作的公開回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙重申，3月至5月民主動力正進行選民登記推廣活動。李運騰問，因此民動在發文的3月19日時，尚未正式成為「35+計劃」的一部分，即使他們曾受邀出席部分會議？趙同意，並指是5月中諮詢了兩個副召集人後才確認要承辦初選。李續問，既然民主動力尚未正式加入「35+計劃」，為何又會發文回應民間對初選的要求？指此事似乎與民主動力無關（none of your business）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙解釋，民主動力自2002年成立以來，就是民主派協調的組織和協作的平台，而這個主要的民主運動工作，「由創會嘅召集人喺2014年交到畀我去管理呢個組織嘅時候，我有個使命係希望可以繼續將個組織維持一個運作」，而有些傳統民主派政黨人士及支持者「都當然希望民主動力可以繼續幫手」。趙續指，他有個「使命感」，就是希望民主動力能在民主運動中，尤其是在協調出選的工作上有所協助，「或者換句話坦白講，如果之後嘅協調工作全部係由戴耀廷做晒、獲得授權嘅話，民主動力係壽終正寢，係唔需要有任何工作。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡問，即他們不想民動被排擠（sidelined）？法庭傳譯一度無法翻譯，陳慶偉遂以中文指是「企埋一邊」，趙答「同意係法官閣下準確嘅演繹」。李運騰指，因此當趙發現沒有被邀出席記者會，他們想看起來是一分子（appear as if a party），趙指會說是「回應」，以繼續參與民主運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指正考慮是否承辦初選戴已稱已邀請民動-批只講事實的部分&quot;&gt;趙指正考慮是否承辦初選戴已稱已邀請民動 批只講「事實的部分」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就民動被邀請承辦初選的過程，趙指戴耀廷與區諾軒於5月初邀請他與民主動力承辦初選，他表示需時考慮。惟當他們正考慮時，「戴耀廷已經喺啲協調會議上講，『我已經邀請咗民主動力去幫手啦』」。李問，即使當時未有正式邀請？趙指「係口頭（邀請），未有正式」。趙並指，戴當時對人講「事實嘅部分」，「事實係佢有邀請民主動力，但係佢冇講事實嘅後半段，係民主動力仲思考中，仲未有回應。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問，那趙或民動成員有否告訴參與者另一半的事實，即民動仍在考慮？李運騰補充趙家賢最後一次出席會議是5月5日。趙指「多謝主控同埋法官嘅問題」，指總幹事黎敬輝於之後會議聽到戴耀廷講法，有向他匯報，黎當日亦有嘗試表達民動仍在考慮中，「但似乎與會者唔係太過着重呢樣嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，他之後有再向戴耀廷說清楚「我哋仲考慮緊」，「請佢唔好再喺其他協調會議場合有咁嘅講法」，並認為客觀的效果「就係令到好多參與協調嘅人士，認為民主動力就會嚟緊幫手做個初選啦」，「當時間過咗一兩個禮拜，造成個事實認知就係：『哦民主動力會做初選啊嘛』」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴口輕輕答允民動全權辦初選但有變異-稱之後主控會帶領我去講&quot;&gt;趙稱戴「口輕輕」答允民動全權辦初選但有變異 稱「之後主控會帶領我去講」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙又提及，5月中下旬與兩名民動副召集人與戴耀廷會面，答應承辦初選時，「當時我要求戴耀廷要承諾，整個初選嘅運作係要民主動力可以全權處理同控制，而佢當時『口輕輕』答係冇問題，而我哋因而信任佢，所以就同意承辦呢個初選」。趙續指，「但當然之後係好多初選嘅流程都好多變異，我相信之後主控會帶領我去講出嚟」，有被告聞言低聲起哄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方問公民黨記者會內容-辯方指趙無出席-趙指望了解其思想狀態&quot;&gt;控方問公民黨記者會內容 辯方指趙無出席 趙指望了解其思想狀態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，萬德豪今亦問及趙家賢是否記得3月25日舉行公民黨記者會，趙答「我係之後嗰日先知道」，並指對會上說的話記憶「好零散」。萬續問，趙是否記得有人提及無差別否決預算案，大律師馬維騉反對指趙根本沒有出席會議，法官李運騰亦指，法庭有記者會片段及謄本，不認為需證人告知。惟萬德豪指，望能了解趙的思想狀態（state of mind），即他對其他黨派有關選舉言論的理解。李指趙已認罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉遂指應問開放問題，並改問趙能否說出該記者會的重點，趙表示是由黨魁楊岳橋帶領該黨數個代表見記者，稱會行使立法會權力，「佢哋係會同政府、依個政權抗爭，佢哋都會用一啲權力去否決一啲議案」，亦承諾積極參與整個民主陣營的協調。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">趙家賢：民主動力20年2月受區諾軒邀請參與協調 蕭若元曾贊助選民登記活動 趙家賢：不認為蔡澤鴻是會議組織者 指對方為「好幫手嘅大義工」 趙家賢：35+首次記者會民主動力「被排除在外」 翌日出帖為「吸Like」、免尷尬</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第卅四日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-29-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-34.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第卅四日】" /><published>2023-03-29T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-03-29T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-34</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-29-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-34.html">&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;趙家賢：戴耀廷「風雲計劃」「引領」本土抗爭派素人參選 爭區議會主導權營造「憲制抗爭」&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1zBZK99.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（29日）踏入審訊第34天。第二名控方證人趙家賢今正式作供，提及戴耀廷2018年提倡「風雲計劃」，以「向政府抗爭的政治理念行先」來尋找「有志之士」填滿區議會「白區」，旨在取得區議會主導權，將地區事務「政治化」並將撥款用於民主工作，及取得特首選委會議席。趙指想讓法庭知道，戴當時已從區議會「着手」，開始營造「憲制抗爭」的概念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，戴「引領」了很多本土抗爭派政治素人參選，並在反修例民怨下大勝，惟他們漠視區議會傳統、「口號式政治表態居多」，令議會變得「標籤化、民粹化、口號式」並帶入立法會選舉，趙認為戴從2018年起將該種形態「慢慢注入，然後『有機地』發展咗出嚟」。法官問戴耀廷推「35+」，是否希望將區選的成功「複製（copy）」？趙先稱「我唔會話係抄咗」，但指戴耀廷乘勢以其作為「大學者、大文豪」的做法去寫文章等，令形勢在立法會再進一步，惟趙其後改口同意。趙作供期間，不時有被告皺眉、搖頭和發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢開始作供-以基督教宣誓&quot;&gt;趙家賢開始作供 以基督教宣誓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第二名控方證人、同案被告趙家賢原定昨天開始作供，惟因法官陳仲衡身體不適押後至今。陳仲衡今步出時沒有配戴口罩，精神不俗，在延伸庭觀看直播的被告稱：「無戴口罩！」，而法官陳慶偉則有戴口罩。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今早10時04分，身穿黑色運動外套、深藍色長褲的趙家賢在3名懲教護送下步入法庭，他面無表情，步履略為緩慢，其後手舉聖經以基督教宣誓，並除下繫在頸上的口罩開始作供。趙作供期間大部分時間微微低頭，語速緩慢、聲線微弱。在趙出庭時，正庭的被告均注視着他，延伸庭的被告亦專心觀看螢幕；趙宣誓時，部分延伸庭被告發笑，包括黃之鋒及吳敏兒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;民主動力負責協調民主派參選-趙家賢及鍾錦麟任正副召集人&quot;&gt;民主動力負責協調民主派參選 趙家賢及鍾錦麟任正副召集人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪其後開始主問。他先問趙家賢是否於2021年6月認罪，趙同意，庭上被告均面露疑惑（萬在小休後糾正應是2022年6月，趙確認）。趙其後同意，他在香港獲得社會科學的學位，再取得公共行政碩士及博士。他在2004年加入民主黨，2007年參選區議會並當選，其後在2011、2015及2019年連任。趙2020年時為東區區議會副主席，也仍然是民主黨黨員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，他於2020年是民主動力的召集人，並指民動於2002年成立，是主要負責泛民主派的協調的非政府組織，曾多次協調民主派參與立法會及區議會選舉，推動香港政制民主化改革。民動2016年至2018年負責人包括他和鍾錦麟等，直至2020年由召集人到司庫的成員均沒改變，而被告譚文豪和尹兆堅至2020年亦是執委會成員。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 西貢區議會前主席鍾錦麟（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙表示，民主動力是一個「小型組織」，對外講法則是「蚊型組織」，有一名總幹事，一般是半職身分，工作量大時會變為全職；並會按工作量決定聘請多少兼職同事。趙表示，2020年時任總幹事為黎敬輝，負責各項行政工作，小至撰寫會議紀錄，大至大項目的行政統籌，若他請假則由兼職員工處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就召集人的工作，趙指是領導整個組織和主持開會，且因民動屬蚊型組織，很多時對外工作是與職員分工。被問職員是否向趙家賢負責，趙指「大致上係」，但他多數是透過總幹事去管理民動秘書處及整個兼職團隊，並由秘書處負責聘請兼職員工。趙又指，黎敬輝在非開會事宜是向他負責，會向他匯報，作為其直屬上司的趙亦會給他指示；但開會時黎則向民動執委會所有委員負責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢指鍾錦麟為其副手-望安排鍾承接其位置&quot;&gt;趙家賢指鍾錦麟為其副手 望安排鍾承接其位置&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問及民動開會次數，趙指通常兩三個月開一次，但疫情期間很多會議改期或延期，他就會直接諮詢副召集人鍾錦麟。區在李追問下，指該情況應在2020年1月開始，而且整個2020年情況都是如此。被問鍾的角色，趙解釋民主動力2003年區選起已主力區議會選舉協調工作，他會與鍾錦麟分工，趙負責香港島和九龍，鍾則負責新界地區。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，鍾是否向趙負責，趙指「我諗唔係用負責嘅字眼」，指鍾是「輔助」他。李問是否即鍾是其下屬？趙指「我諗用副手會正確啲」。法庭傳譯主任一度將「副手」譯作「assistant」，陳慶偉提議改為「right hand man」，李則提出是「第二負責人（second in charge）」。趙回應他本身想安排鍾承接召集人位置，同意鍾是他指定的承接人（desinated successor）。李再問，趙是否即訓練鍾任承接人，並給他指導？趙指「我唔敢用訓練……係等多啲時間去適應」，又指二人是交流以最好的方式做事，「我唔敢去講到係指導」。在延伸庭的黃之鋒聞後發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙又指，總幹事是受薪，惟副召集人均與他一樣用義工身分營運組織，「我同鍾錦麟都係組織嘅義工嚟」。趙形容鍾「好尊重召集人」，會給予趙意見及商談出最好的做事方式，趙就作最終決定如何指示職員處理；鍾協調後亦會向他匯報，「我哋都緊密聯繫處理返工作」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢指2012年佔中認識戴耀廷-稱戴常與民主派領導層見面推銷新想法&quot;&gt;趙家賢指2012年佔中認識戴耀廷 稱戴常與民主派領導層見面「推銷」新想法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪其後就「35+」計劃發問。趙確認有聽過該計劃，萬德豪問誰是主要推手（key promoter），趙微微低頭輕聲說：「戴耀廷」，並確認於2012年已因工作關係認識戴。法官李運騰問是否與佔領中環有關，趙同意，並主動補充指2012年戴提出佔中運動，期間他就香港政制發展進行了數次商討日。趙指自己當時為「香港最大間調解組織嘅副會長」，故他找了一些調解員朋友，而他自己亦是認可調解員，因此他與朋友到商討小組擔任促導員（facilitator）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xPZLxAl.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 戴耀廷為「和平佔中」發起人之一（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問，戴是否直至2020年都有與戴保持聯絡，趙稱在民主動力的工作上有接觸，並指戴在佔中後，變成民主發展「較前進概念」人士的「帶領者」。他補充，戴會透過支持他的民間組織，發展很多新的想法；戴亦經常性與民主派政黨的不同領導層見面，向他們「推銷」或作出建議，因此於政黨協調中，民主動力在政黨要求下需要與戴接觸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指民動望減低民主黨派選舉衝撞-邀各派人士入執委會-包括譚文豪及尹兆堅&quot;&gt;趙指民動望減低民主黨派選舉「衝撞」 邀各派人士入執委會 包括譚文豪及尹兆堅&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙再解釋，民主動力在民主派政黨當中，是作為協作組織的角色。而民動的成立，是因有數個民主黨派在選舉中有「衝撞」，他望能減低衝撞、促進協調，故民動中很多委員都是來自民主派政黨。李運騰問及實際上有甚麼「衝撞」，趙指區議會是單議席單票制，若一個選區有兩個民主派政黨參選，就會「分咗票」，導致建制當選。因此民主動力在選舉前的數年前已經要開始做協調工作，原因是「地區工作要去到好細緻嘅地區服務市民，唔係話突然間跳入個社區去做」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同案被告公民黨的譚文豪及民主黨的尹兆堅均是執委會成員，李運騰問譚是代表公民黨抑或只是個人身份，趙指他是「立法會議員」身份，因在區議會協調選舉工作中，公民黨已有其他人代表，認為有不同分工；又指譚可向民動提供公民黨訊息，但因工作較忙沒有很緊密的溝通。趙亦確認，是因各黨派在選舉有衝突，故任召集人時特意邀請不同政黨加入執委會，因此譚及尹均獲邀加入。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴耀廷2018年推風雲計劃-找認同其信念人士填滿白區&quot;&gt;趙稱戴耀廷2018年推「風雲計劃」 找認同其信念人士填滿「白區」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，民主動力主要做哪類型的協調工作，趙舉例指2019年的區議會選舉，他於2017年3月，已與各大政黨地區代表開會做協調工作。被問有誰參與，趙指各大政黨的地區代表都有出席，並有一個全港選區的名單，如果「撞區」，即同一選區A政黨及B政黨均望派人出選的話，民主動力就有一個「大黨讓細黨」的機制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙表示，自2013年至2017年情況都是如此，惟到了2018年開始就有變化，因當時戴耀廷提倡「風雲計劃」，打算就無人參選的選區「搵多啲嘅有志者去出選」，變相與民主動力一直與政黨和政團組織開會協調的模式出現「衝突」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sGoFYM6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 戴耀廷在2019年3月曾聯同其他公民團體舉行記者會，呼籲積極參與區議會選舉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指民動以往協調各民主黨派，但戴則是想在無人參選的地區培植（plant）參選人，趙稱「冇錯，法官大人」，解釋一般政黨的地區工作者，會有一段時間在地區「深耕細作」，惟戴的做法是找有志之士，「當然係搵佢向政府抗爭嘅政治理念行先」，此時黃之鋒發笑。趙續指，區議會選區有400多個，傳統民主派政黨的深耕細作模式不能覆蓋全部選區，而戴的計劃就是找「有志之士或認同戴耀廷信念的人士」，派人填滿沒有民主派政黨發展的「白區」，令民主派在2019年區議會選舉可贏取更多議席，挑戰本身會自動當選的建制派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指戴望將地區事務政治化取區議會過半議席選特首-開始營造以憲制抗爭概念&quot;&gt;趙指戴望將地區事務「政治化」、取區議會過半議席選特首 開始營造以憲制抗爭概念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問戴最終是否成功，黃之鋒再發笑。趙指「我講多少少內情先」，解釋戴曾公開表示望取得各個區議會過半數的主導權，令政府社區參與撥款可運用在民主陣營認為合適的公民社會工作上，推動公民社會，特別是民主概念的工作；此外，取得區議會議席過半數後，在「未完善選舉制度之前」，民主派區議員便可取得特首選委會內由區議員互選的一百多個議席。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 趙家賢在2020年區議會換屆後，出任東區區議會副主席&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指趙提及填白區、取得選委會議席及撥款等，問趙可否再解釋，趙稱「係，多謝法官大人」，並解釋戴耀廷當時「想將當時區議會選舉，講緊地區事務嘅野，透過佢嘅推動，係將佢政治化」，除了將地區文娛活動的撥款變成是推動民主的活動外，同時循憲制角度，戴認為區議會取得過半議席，便可獲得當時港九新界的特首選委會議席。趙並說：「我想要帶出呢個位比法庭知道呢，就係戴耀廷當時已經係想喺區議會着手，將佢嗰個用憲制做抗爭嘅概念已經開始營造出嚟」，趙補充是指2018至2019年的時候，鄒家成聞言搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問，因此2019年民主派在區議會取得壓倒性勝利？區同意。陳再問，故趙指戴的想法是在2019年前出現？趙答「佢係一步步去營造呢個嘅情況出嚟」，鄒家成再搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指戴耀廷引領本土派政治素人出選-令議會文化起變化-口號式政治表態居多&quot;&gt;趙指戴耀廷引領本土派政治素人出選 令議會文化起變化 「口號式政治表態居多」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，「我想講嘅就係，18、19年嘅時候我同佢（戴耀廷）會喺好多傳媒嘅訪問係有針鋒相對」，此時吳政亨發笑，鄒亦再搖頭。趙解釋，民主動力當時獲各個傳統民主派政黨授權「睇住區議會選舉地區嘅工作」，而他們深信每個選區「一定要擺時間落去發展、服務市民」，若只是短期派人「空降選區」會對社區發展不利，因地區工作者不會懂得如何在社區協作和與不同團體溝通。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，戴的風雲計劃「雖然佢最後嘅人數唔太多，但佢引領咗好多本土抗爭派嘅政治素人都有出選」，而當時政治大勢是反修例事件有很大民怨，故民主陣營在區選取得大勝，「喺之後嘅區議會，以及喺地區嘅論政、議政、表達意見嘅文化係有好大嘅轉變」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙解釋，在未有大勝之前，民主派議員的意見與建制派時有相撞，「但係我哋係地區為本」，故會以議案對社區有最大利益作為討論基礎。但到了2020年，即新一屆區議會上任後，「整個地區議會嘅文化係有好大嘅變化，新當選嘅，可能係由風雲計劃、或者係由本土抗爭派嘅一啲政治素人當選，佢哋嘅取態係好難去處理。」趙指，「佢哋係要口號式政治表態居多」，而且就社區傳統文化活動的撥款，若全部為建制派提出，他們就會以「派別分野」而「完全予以否決」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指區議會變得民粹化口號式本土派素人漠視傳統-指是由戴耀廷注入及有機發展&quot;&gt;趙指區議會變得「民粹化、口號式」、本土派素人漠視傳統 指是由戴耀廷注入及有機發展&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指他不太能跟上，問趙是否想表達本土派將區議會「政治化」，並會否決建制派提出的社區項目？區指「係嘅法官大人，我當時都觀察到係有呢個情況發生」。陳續問，即區議會變得不理智和政治化、沒有建設性，討論結果只是基於各派的意識形態？趙指「大致上係嘅法官大人」，並補充「本身做開地區議員嘅民主派政黨呢，並不是以呢一種嘅方式行事嘅」，但當整個議會文化「變到咁嘅時候，係好難去協作」。趙指，尤其是一些本土抗爭和政治素人，他們在各區議會的人數「仲多過」傳統民主派政黨，「所以係只可以係順住個形勢而行咁解」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙又舉例，他本身是東區區議會副主席，在協助主席處理會議進行時，本身做法是由主席或副主席讓議員提問，再到部門回應，「其實所有對答唔係議員直接問個官員、官員直接回答，係全部經主席去安排 」，故議員或官員發言後，也會有「多謝主席」的做法，「呢個無論係舊陣時乜嘢黨派都好，都會繼續秉承嘅一個做法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟趙指，到了2020年新一屆區議會，「某一啲都係政治素人或者都係本土新當選嘅，佢哋都完全……佢完全漠視咗呢一樣嘢」，此時何桂藍發笑，曾任東區區議員的鄭達鴻和李予信也對視而笑。趙續指，「佢哋對於一啲本身制度嘅傳統係不會加以重視」，而「整體呢個嘅文化」，加上議會內「標籤化、民粹化、口號式」的情況，「其實就會慢慢帶咗去會覺得要喺立法會選舉嘅時候，都應該有一個模式，都會慢慢個民意係偏向咗用咗呢個嘅方式去處理」。此時旁聽的前元朗區議會主席黃偉賢也發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙並指，「喺我個角度去睇，係戴耀廷喺18年開始，係將呢一種嘅形態去慢慢注入咗，然後『有機地』發展咗出嚟」，此時李予信邊笑邊搖頭，余慧明也以口型做出「吓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指本土派素人變得心雄戴乘勢以大學者大文豪推動-同意戴35望複製區選成功&quot;&gt;趙指本土派素人變得「心雄」、戴乘勢以「大學者大文豪」推動 同意戴「35+」望複製區選成功&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，故剛才主控問及「35+」，「就會慢慢個討論，就變咗一定要係集中票源去令到立法會有過一半數都係支持民主價值嘅人士」，何啟明皺眉。趙並指，尤其很多本土抗爭派和政治素人，他們可能只是落區兩三個月就高票當選，「因為係乘住當時反修例運動嗰啲對政府嘅不滿啦，所以變咗佢哋會……我哋俗語所講就係『心雄』咗」。法庭傳譯一度譯作「courageous」，趙補充是「雄心壯志」，萬德豪則稱是「ambitious」。陳慶偉則指，是「野心大咗」而非「雄心壯志」，指「雄心壯志」是正面的形容，「野心」則可以是好或壞，趙答「多謝法官大人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，戴耀廷是否希望將區選的成功「複製（copy）」？趙答「我唔會話係抄咗」，又指「其實當時佢係整個形勢大勝咗之後，佢就乘勢以佢作為『大學者、大文豪』嘅一啲做法，而佢就去寫文章等等，就去將整個形勢就攞嚟更加進一步去推，咁我哋就可以開始喺立法會再進一步啦」，趙提及「大學者、大文豪」時，多名被告面露愕然，有人發笑。趙並指，「嗰陣時我冇同佢有咩特別嘅辯論」，因2019年11月他耳朵受襲休養，過了區選，區議會事務亦開始繁忙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，故當時「整個政治格局或整個政治論述方面，我同埋民主陣營喺當時都冇特別參與」，而開始有「35+」的說法時，「咁戴耀廷就繼續順住呢個，我叫做『民意』啦，因為當時社會氣氛就係希望立法會過半，做出一啲改變」，就開始形成要在立法會選舉協調取得「35+」。陳慶偉再次問，故「35+」的想法，就是戴希望複製區選的成功？趙答「冇錯法官閣下」，並指除了社會形勢，戴耀廷「佢做嘅一啲步驟，令到成個形勢做成」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（29日）踏入審訊第34天。趙家賢今繼續作供，指民主派於2019年區議會大勝後，「作為學者，呢個『大文豪、大思想家』嘅戴耀廷，就想將呢個勝選嘅民意、民氣延續去立法會選舉當中」，有被告聞言皺眉和發笑。趙又指戴於2019年12月撰文談立會過半，並於翌年2至3月將民間的「35+」概念加以運用析述，相信戴當時開始對本案計劃有「初步框架」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，繼曾參與九東協調的前觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻，控方今亦確認時任民主動力總幹事黎敬輝是本案「共謀者」之一，惟他2021年7月已離港。法官李運騰認為情況非常不理想，指現已開審多時，籲控方提供一份共謀者名單，否則辯方難以得知控方依賴何人的言行指證被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指本土派素人區選大勝後變得心雄&quot;&gt;趙指本土派素人區選大勝後變得「心雄」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢在早上提及，戴耀廷在2018年推動「風雲計劃」，終「引領」多名本土派政治素人參選區議會並勝出，並指戴當時已開始營造「憲制抗爭」的概念。趙又指，素人令區議會變得「標籤化、民粹化、口號式」，表示「喺我個角度去睇，係戴耀廷喺18年開始，係將呢一種嘅形態去慢慢注入咗，然後『有機地』發展咗出嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，因此到了本案的「35+」，「就會慢慢個討論，就變咗一定要係集中票源去令到立法會有過一半數都係支持民主價值嘅人士」，何啟明皺眉。趙並指，尤其很多本土抗爭派和政治素人，他們可能只是落區兩三個月就高票當選，「因為係乘住當時反修例運動嗰啲對政府嘅不滿啦，所以變咗佢哋會……我哋俗語所講就係『心雄』咗」。法庭傳譯一度譯作「courageous」，趙補充是「雄心壯志」，萬德豪則稱是「ambitious」。陳慶偉則指，是「野心大咗」而非「雄心壯志」，指「雄心壯志」是正面的形容，「野心」則可以是好或壞，趙答「多謝法官大人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，戴耀廷是否希望將區選的成功「複製（copy）」？趙答「我唔會話係抄咗」，又指「其實當時佢係整個形勢大勝咗之後，佢就乘勢以佢作為『大學者、大文豪』嘅一啲做法，而佢就去寫文章等等，就去將整個形勢就攞嚟更加進一步去推，咁我哋就可以開始喺立法會再進一步啦」，趙提及「大學者、大文豪」時，多名被告面露愕然，有人發笑。趙並指，「嗰陣時我冇同佢有咩特別嘅辯論」，因2019年11月他耳朵受襲休養，過了區選，區議會事務亦開始繁忙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙再稱作為大文豪大思想家的戴耀廷想將勝選民意民氣延續至立會選舉&quot;&gt;趙再稱作為「大文豪、大思想家」的戴耀廷想將勝選民意民氣延續至立會選舉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪下午問及，趙曾指戴提出一個新想法，問戴有甚麼新想法，惟辯方質疑這屬引導性問題，指控方應問一些中立的問題。法官陳慶偉遂改問：「35+是否戴的新想法？」，趙表示在區議會選舉後，戴耀廷在接受媒體訪問及發表文章，提及對整個政局發展的評論及倡議。他又指，正如法官指民主派在區議會選舉大勝，「咁作為學者，呢個大文豪、大思想家嘅戴耀廷，就想將呢個勝選嘅民意、民氣延續去立法會選舉當中」，陳志全皺眉，延伸庭的黃之鋒亦面露驚訝發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指2月至3月35概念在民間出現-戴開始對計劃有初步框架&quot;&gt;趙指2月至3月「35+」概念在民間出現 戴開始對計劃有「初步框架」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，他記得戴耀廷在2019年12月底，曾撰文談及如何達成立會過半，之後在傳媒、各方論政、文章和評論等，除戴外也有很多人一起討論這方面的發展。趙表示，直至2020年2至3月，「更加有一個35+嘅概念喺民間出咗嚟」，認為戴再加以運用及析述，並指根據戴耀廷在文章及傳媒訪問的說法，相信戴在當時開始對本案的35+計劃有「初步框架」。法官李運騰一度指，希望證人能根據時間順序作供，而且相比起證人對政治氣候的個人判斷，法庭更需要的是具體事實（concrete facts）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認蔡澤鴻為35九東立選座談會群組的管理員&quot;&gt;趙確認蔡澤鴻為「35+九東立選座談會」群組的管理員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪其後向​​趙確認從其電話檢取的WhatsApp 對話紀錄，包括九龍東、香港島、新界西等多個群組訊息。就2020年2月成立的「35+九東立選座談會」群組，萬指紀錄顯示前觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻為列表上首名成員，名字旁寫有「admin（管理員）」，問群組是否由蔡建立，趙表示蔡是群組管理員，但未知道群組由誰建立。在延伸庭的吳敏兒微笑，眾被告亦有討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後萬德豪展示趙家賢與戴耀廷的對話紀錄，顯示兩人在2013年5月至2020年10月有對話。趙確認於2013年已認識戴，因2012年在工作上有接觸。法官李運騰引述對話指，兩人在2013年曾就佔中運動找調解員一事作討論，趙同意並指首個訊息是由他發給戴。趙亦解釋指當時的佔中政制商討有3個階段，自己在第一及第三階段均有協助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙解釋whatsapp的廣播訊息功能稱被戴耀廷加在7個廣播群組中&quot;&gt;趙解釋WhatsApp的廣播訊息功能、稱被戴耀廷加在7個廣播群組中&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉早前盤問時曾援引上述紀錄，指「35+新東final」文件曾發出，但訊息發出者為一串數字及「@broadcast」的字眼，不清楚該組字眼意思。趙家賢今解釋這是WhatsApp 的廣播功能，指他經常會使用，可將發送對象的電話加入廣播群組，而對方亦需將發送人電話加為聯絡人，而當他按下按鈕，名單上的人士就會分別收到私人訊息，並會有特別顏色顯示。法官李運騰問名單是否有人數限制，趙稱兩年前他尚未還柙時，最多可將200人列入名單。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，若發送對象沒有將發送者電話加為聯絡人，發送者會否得知對方未能接收訊息。趙指發送訊息後，按實訊息兩至三秒，會顯示廣播名單中誰人已接收及閱讀訊息。趙亦同意該名單可以儲存並於下次再使用，舉例指他曾建立名為「東區議員群組」的廣播名單，發訊息後相隔一段時間可再傳訊息。趙確認他只是以用家角度、而非專家角度理解有關功能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就紀錄上顯示7組數字和「@broadcast」，趙家賢笑稱「本人雖然並不是WhatsApp 專家」，但認為紀錄顯示他被戴耀廷加在7個廣播群組中，但他無法得知其他被列入名單的人。他亦解釋，以其理解警方IT組檢取其電話紀錄時，系統應將他與戴耀廷的對話或關係綜合於此。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱原打算分開公用及私人電話-最終兩部電話均用作與戴聯絡&quot;&gt;趙稱原打算分開公用及私人電話 最終兩部電話均用作與戴聯絡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續指，在趙家賢另一部電話亦檢取到他與戴耀廷的對話紀錄，該些紀錄是由2013年12月至2020年10月。李運騰問趙是否分別用兩部電話與戴聯絡，趙表示：「法官閣下，本身從政咁耐，係想分開一部私人電話，一部公用電話嘅」，李笑言「相信很多大律師都會這樣做」，眾人發笑，趙逐笑稱：「但大家見到係已經痴埋晒一齊啦！」，並同意間中會分別使用兩部電話聯絡戴。萬另問到民主動力的群組，趙承認該群組是由他建立，對話涉及2020年6月至7月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指民主動力總幹事黎敬輝為本案共謀者之一-官促提供共謀者名單&quot;&gt;控方指民主動力總幹事黎敬輝為本案共謀者之一 官促提供共謀者名單&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示趙家賢與民主動力總幹事黎敬輝，從2020年1月至2021年1月的WhatsApp 對話。惟大律師馬維騉關注，黎敬輝是控方證人，而他並沒有獲豁免起訴，認為黎因此並非本案共謀者（co-conspirator）之一，相關訊息很大機會只是傳聞證供（heresay）。控方早前確認本案依賴「共謀者原則」，並呈交針對各被告的證據列表，根據該原則，各共謀者的言行均可用來指證所有被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官其後下令趙家賢離席，趙走時向法官席兩次點頭。萬德豪遂表示，控方立場是黎敬輝也是本案的共謀者之一。法官李運騰指，若這是控方一早的立場，最好的做法應是將他的名字寫在公訴書（indictment）上讓所有人得悉，即使最終可能因證據不足而沒有起訴他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方日前亦首度指名字不在公訴書上、參與九東協調的前觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻是本案共謀者之一，李運騰指今次是第二次發生類似情況。他指明白本案或牽涉其他控方知道名字的共謀者，但這令法庭和辯方陷入非常困難的處境，舉例庭上數度提及張崑陽，相信控方也會說他是共謀者，惟其名字也不在公訴書上，反問辯方如何得知控方依賴何人的言行指證被告，形容情況非常不理想。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黎敬輝2021年已離港&quot;&gt;控方指黎敬輝2021年已離港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪表示明白，指應待審結才處理，又指大家都知道本案有更多共謀者。李運騰續指，現已開審多時，望控方能提供一份他們指控為本案共謀者的名單。萬表示，早前已提交「共謀者原則」下針對各被告的證據列表，相信辯方已清楚控方立場是指黎是共謀者；並補充指黎敬輝已於2021年7月離港，控方也不能做任何事。李指不是要控方即時修訂公訴書，但重申望控方至少能提供沒有出現在公訴書上的共謀者名單，又指共謀者原則是否適用將交由法庭決定，萬表示願意提供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉補充，一個人是否共謀者，以及他是否被控串謀是兩回事，如黎敬輝就被指為共謀者但沒被控，但望控方能讓他們得知誰是共謀者，讓法庭之後可就是否依賴相關言行作出裁斷。至於馬維騉的關注，陳慶偉指尚未知道控方打算如何使用該些訊息，李運騰指若辯方有爭議會稍後處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

This transition affects the future of the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act, a piece of U.S. legislation that aims to provide timely access to electronic evidence (e-evidence).&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Despite past disputes over data privacy and surveillance, both sides have found common ground – through the EU–U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)’s Declaration on Government Access to Personal Data held by Private Sector Entities – and created a forum for cooperation in digital trade through the Trade and Technology Council (TTC). Getting to this point, however, involved a complicated process, and despite real progress, the story is not yet over.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and the European Union are each other’s top trading partners. The transatlantic and data transfer relationship creates a $7.1 trillion economic relationship, so this is not a minor problem. All sides want to find solutions that permit digital trade to continue and that streamline the evidentiary process needed for law enforcement in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This white paper looks at the tensions between the desire for timely law enforcement access to evidence, European concerns over digital sovereignty, and the mutual desire for a strengthened transatlantic relationship. The nature of cloud services means that data is often stored on one or several servers outside of a user’s borders as well as outside of the country where a company’s headquarters may be located. This makes economic sense but raises legal questions when governments wish to access electronic evidence that is stored outside of their jurisdiction for an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;genesis-of-the-cloud-act&quot;&gt;Genesis of the CLOUD Act&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a new problem, and enforcement agencies in many countries have complained for years about the slowness of conventional processes, such as Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties when compared to the transitory nature of digital evidence. A 2013 internal government review on the United States’ ability to fulfill these requests noted it took approximately 10 months, with some requests taking much longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflict over government access to data in another jurisdiction came to a head in the 2013 Microsoft Ireland case. In 2013, the United States presented Microsoft with a warrant to disclose data – which the company found to be stored in a data center in Dublin. Given the data’s location, Microsoft argued that a U.S. court did not have the authority to issue a warrant for data stored abroad and asked the court to suppress the order. While the reasoning of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York that material control over the data – regardless of where stored – was enough for Microsoft to comply with the order, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found this to be an unauthorized extraterritorial application of U.S. law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States appealed the Second Circuit’s decision to the Supreme Court, referencing other courts had previously found requiring U.S. companies to comply with Stored Communications Act (SCA) warrants outside of the United States is a domestic application of the law. Before the Supreme Court ruled, Congress passed the CLOUD Act and made the Microsoft Ireland case moot. The CLOUD Act amended the SCA to clarify that communication service providers must comply with legal requests for data from the U.S. government, “regardless of whether such communication, record, or other information is located within or outside of the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the CLOUD Act confirmed the legality of U.S. government requests for data stored by U.S. communications service providers outside of the United States, it also created concerns in the European Union over extraterritorial application of U.S. law. Building on the mistrust over user privacy and data protection that was exacerbated in part by the Snowden revelations about surveillance, the CLOUD Act faced criticism and concern from EU officials worried that it would infringe upon European digital sovereignty. Digital sovereignty, or the control of technology operating under one’s jurisdiction, is a key goal for EU member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intent-of-cloud-act-agreements&quot;&gt;Intent of CLOUD Act Agreements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service providers have traditionally been hesitant to answer foreign government requests for data because of fears that they could be found in violation of domestic laws governing privacy and data protection. The CLOUD Act was intended to address this, however, with a second provision that allowed the U.S. government to enter into executive agreements with third countries for reciprocal expedited access to e-evidence held by providers based abroad. This provision was frequently misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bilateral agreements contemplated under the CLOUD Act were intended to remove these conflicts when both the requesting and supplying jurisdictions share similar privacy and civil liberties protections. An agreement under the CLOUD Act requires an assessment of the foreign country’s domestic law to ensure it respects “substantive and procedural protections for privacy and civil liberties” and limits who can be targeted. Any orders issued under the CLOUD Act must “be for the purpose of obtaining information relating to the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of serious crime, including terrorism” and must be subject to review or oversight by a judicial authority. This provision of the CLOUD Act was intended to create a quicker and more efficient way for law enforcement agencies to gain access to electronic data held outside of their borders by global cloud service providers. The act does not replace the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty process, but rather provides an additional method of cross-border data access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a shared transatlantic recognition of the problem, the United States has only been able to reach CLOUD Act agreements with the United Kingdom and Australia and is reportedly negotiating with Canada. This slow pace means that the environment for CLOUD Act negotiations is being reshaped by transatlantic developments and new agreements on data and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2019, a joint U.S.-EU statement announced the beginning of formal negotiations on an agreement for facilitating access to e-evidence in criminal investigations. This negotiation was supposed to happen in parallel with the European Union’s own framework for e-evidence – the E-Evidence Regulation. Initially, internal EU disagreements prevented the regulation from being enacted and the negotiations with the United States from proceeding. However, in January 2023, the European Council and European Parliament reached agreement on the draft regulation and the draft directive on cross-border access to e-evidence with similar authorities as the CLOUD Act. This signals real progress on reaching an e-evidence agreement between the European Union and the United States and the Department of Justice announced in March 2023 that negotiations had resumed with the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conflicts-between-eu-law-and-the-cloud-act&quot;&gt;Conflicts between EU Law and the CLOUD Act&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a U.S.-EU agreement on access to e-evidence, conflicts between the CLOUD Act and EU regulation remain. An initial assessment commissioned by European authorities of the compatibility between the CLOUD Act and EU legal framework identified the main potential conflict to be Article 48 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on transfers or disclosures not authorized by EU law. Article 48 outlines that a foreign court order would not be sufficient to make a transfer lawful unless “based on an international agreement.” The European Commission’s objectives for an international agreement include enhancing the legal certainty between the jurisdictions and allowing for the transfer of e-evidence on a reciprocal basis while ensuring respect for EU law. The European Commission argued in the Microsoft Ireland case (through an external brief) that Article 48 “makes clear that a foreign court order does not, as such, make a transfer lawful under the GDPR.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article 49 of the GDPR establishes the conditions under which an international transfer could occur if an international agreement is not in place. Specifically, the first paragraph of the article stipulates, among other potential conditions, that the subject is notified and provided consent, or the transfer is necessary for “important reasons of public interest.” A CLOUD Act transfer could also be considered lawful under Article 6(1)(d) when the transfer is in the vital interest of data subjects themselves (e.g., accessing personal data concerning abducted minors). The EU assessment concluded that an “international agreement containing strong procedural and substantive fundamental rights safeguards appears the most appropriate instrument to ensure the necessary level of protection for EU data subjects and legal certainty for businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress on a CLOUD Act agreement between the United States and the European Union was complicated by decisions made by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Since the 2013 Snowden revelations that exposed mass surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) for counterterrorism purposes, there has been increased concern in Europe over U.S. government access to data concerning EU citizens. In 2015, the CJEU invalidated the 2000 Safe Harbor Privacy Principles agreement between the United States and the European Union in a decision known as Schrems I – the name coming from Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems, who has launched several complaints to European data protection agencies over Facebook’s handling of user data. In the Schrems I decision, the CJEU cited the Snowden revelations as demonstrating “a ‘significant overreach’ on the part of the NSA and other federal agencies” and that data transfers to the United States could violate Article 7 – respect for private and family life – of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Schrems I, work to rebuild the legal basis for transatlantic data flows began. This resulted in the adequacy decision of the Privacy Shield framework, a renewed agreement between the United States and the European Union on privacy principles. However, in 2020, the CJEU invalidated Privacy Shield in a decision known as Schrems II, in which the European Union was principally concerned with U.S. regulations enabling certain signals intelligence activities. The decision referenced Section 702 of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the U.S. government to compel communication service providers to assist in the surveillance of foreign persons outside the country, and U.S. Executive Order 12333, which denotes when intelligence agencies can engage in foreign intelligence surveillance abroad. Schrems II outlined two necessary benchmarks for the transatlantic data flows to be in compliance with EU law: U.S. surveillance activities should be limited to what is necessary and proportional and should be subject to judicial redress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2022, the United States and European Union agreed in principle to the EU–U.S. Data Privacy Framework to address concerns raised in Schrems II. This framework was then implemented by the October 2022 U.S. “Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards For United States Signals Intelligence Activities” (EO 14086). EO 14086 pledges to “tailor U.S. signals intelligence collection to what is ‘necessary’ and ‘proportionate’ to protect both national interests and individual privacy and civil liberties” and enables a redress mechanism through the establishment of the Data Protection Review Court. In response, the European Union issued a draft adequacy decision, and it is expected that the legal framework for transatlantic data flows will be reinstated. The renewed framework highlights the common ground the United States and European Union have on access to data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;european-response&quot;&gt;European Response&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns with the CLOUD Act and the application of non-European laws to European jurisdictions sparked a flurry of action in Europe. Developed in 2020, the European strategy for data is an initiative to ensure European competitiveness and data sovereignty amid concerns over extraterritorial laws in the transfer of data. The strategy explicitly states that the application of the CLOUD Act is a risk to the data of EU citizens and businesses stored by cloud service providers and subject to third-country legislation. The strategy led to the creation of the Data Governance Act (DGA) and Data Act. While the GDPR provides a governance framework for personal data, the DGA and the proposed Data Act provide an additional framework for the reuse, transfer, and protection of nonpersonal data. Personal data is information relating to identifiable individuals, whereas nonpersonal data is information not related to an identifiable person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both acts aim to ensure that Europe benefits from the data it creates. The DGA looks to make more data available, combat technical barriers in data reuse, and advance trust in data sharing across the European Union. The Data Act tackles the question of who can create value from European data and where this can take place. In the DGA, international access and transfer of EU data is limited – compliance with a third-country decision that compels the disclosure of data held in the European Union must be based on an international agreement between the third country and the European Union or a member state. In the absence of an international agreement, Article 31 outlines that foreign access requests are honored only when they are deemed proportional and specific, subject to third-party court or tribunal review, and considerate of EU and member state legal interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal for the Data Act contains similar provisions – if no international agreement exists, the transfer “should only be allowed if it has been verified that the third country’s legal system requires the reasons and proportionality of the decision to be set out, that the court order or the decision is specific in character, and that the reasoned objection of the addressee is subject to a review by a competent court in the third country, which is empowered to take duly into account the relevant legal interests of the provider of such data” – and its recent revisions reportedly align language concerning international data transfers more closely with the DGA. These rules will complicate international transfers of nonpersonal data, as each request must undergo a review process by “competent authorities” designated by the member states to ensure that adequate safeguards for compliance with the DGA – and the Data Act once enacted – are in place. Potential conflicts between the CLOUD Act and the GDPR remain, and new legislation, such as the DGA and the Data Act, will further complicate the legal basis for nonpersonal data transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security-standards-for-cloud-service-providers&quot;&gt;Security Standards for Cloud Service Providers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European action is also focused on regulating cloud service providers with security requirements that include sovereignty provisions, and, in the case of France, forced technology transfer to local joint venture partners as a condition of market entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2021, the French National Cloud Strategy outlined the development of a “Cloud de confiance” label to further protect French data while enabling the use of innovative services. This label is based on the certification scheme SecNumCloud – a security standard for cloud service providers launched in 2016. The strategy outlined that the Cloud de confiance label would allow the creation of new cloud service companies with European ownership and foreign technology to ensure that cloud service providers operating in France provide both legal and technical protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France updated the sovereignty requirements in SecNumCloud in March 2022 following the strategy’s direction to focus on integrating protection criteria with respect to extra-European law. The provisions include joint ownership requirements to preclude majority foreign-owned providers from being SecNumCloud certified. Joint-ownership requirements similar to those used by China sparked a number of partnerships between French and U.S. companies to build joint cloud services with majority French ownership, such as between Google Cloud and Thales and between Capgemini, Orange, and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SecNumCloud contains provisions that go beyond cybersecurity requirements. Its considerations of foreign jurisdiction and control of data relate more to sovereignty than to cybersecurity. The updated SecNumCloud certification includes requirements for the “central administration or main establishment of the service provider” to be located in the European Union and localization requirements that the provider must store and process customer and technical data in the European Union. The SecNumCloud requirements have met with opposition from industry since they could impact security and raise costs. There are also concerns overs its localization requirements and immunity to extraterritorial legislation. Some analysts argue that SecNumCloud requirements “breach both France and the European Union’s (EU) commitments under the World Trade Organization’s General Agreement on Trade in Services.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) is also developing its certification scheme for cloud services (EUCS), as directed by Article 48 of the European Union’s Cybersecurity Act. The scheme is a cybersecurity certification system for cloud services with three assurance levels: basic, substantial, and high. The basic requirements are meant to define a minimum acceptable baseline for cloud cybersecurity; the substantial requirements are meant to define standards to mitigate against cyberattacks carried out by actors with limited skills and resources; and the high requirements are meant to define standards to mitigate against cyberattacks carried out by actors with significant skills and resources. In April 2022, the European Commission reportedly asked ENISA to include sovereignty requirements in the updated version of EUCS. The proposed sovereignty requirements would only apply to high level certifications. According to reporting on the draft requirements, the provider would have to be “headquartered in Europe, not be controlled by any non-EU entity,” and be “completely independent from non-EU laws.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although currently voluntary, the Directive on Measures for a High Common Level of Cybersecurity across the Union (NIS2 Directive), approved in November 2022, gives member states the ability to mandate compliance with EU certification standards, such as EUCS. The directive states that “in order to demonstrate compliance with certain requirements of Article 18, member states may require essential and important entities to certify certain ICT [information and communications technology] products, ICT services, and ICT processes under specific European cybersecurity certification schemes adopted pursuant to Article 49 of Regulation (EU) 2019/881.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drafting of EUCS has been criticized for a lack of transparency and accountability, and industry associations have raised concerns about the politization of the process in multiple joint memos. EUCS is also seen as problematic by European member states. Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden have raised concerns about the requirements. At the December 2022 TTC meeting, U.S. secretary of commerce Gina Raimondo offered the TTC as a potential avenue to present differing opinions over EUCS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ENISA will present an updated draft of the requirements to the European Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG) – a coalition of cybersecurity authorities in member states – which will then issue an opinion for ENISA’s consideration. The ECCG will then have three months to form a draft opinion, after which ENISA will have six months to present a final draft to the commission. EUCS is set to be implemented in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skepticism about these EU initiatives is driven in part by the fact that the location of data does not ensure the security of data. Best practices, such as the use of encryption, are what make data secure, regardless of where it is located. Inadequately secured data is vulnerable wherever it is located. Given the importance of the transatlantic relationship, further progress to bridge legal differences between the United States and the European Union should remain a priority on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concerns-over-european-action&quot;&gt;Concerns over European Action&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the European Union, there have been calls to discuss sovereignty requirements in cybersecurity certification schemes at the European Council level, rather than ENISA, to ensure adequate input from member states. Countries noted the political nature of these sovereignty requirements and requested increased transparency and conversation on the EUCS drafting process. Germany suggested these EUCS requirements be discussed through the European Council’s Horizontal Working Party on Cyber Issues or the Working Party on Telecommunications and Information Society. A recent document from member states explored alternative solutions to safeguard against the application of non-EU law in the context of EUCS, including more specific levels of assurances for critical uses and modifying pending EU legislation to discuss the issue at a political level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backlash from governments and industry is largely rooted in the potential damage from data localization requirements on innovation and security in the European Union. As U.S. companies account for 72 percent of the European cloud market, limiting Europe’s industry choice through these requirements will raise costs and create a gaps in capacity for European industry. The fate of Gaia-X, an initiative launched in 2020 to defend European interests and values in the cloud, suggests that both sides would benefit from a cooperative solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatives have been discussed to address European concerns about extraterritorial access to data. Companies in particular point to encryption over localization as the key protection for data. They have also accelerated partnerships with domestic providers to ensure local storage and compliance with country regulations. Google, for example, is specifically expanding their trusted partner cloud program to ensure collaboration with local providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data localization could limit access to cybersecurity resources, hinder incident response efforts, and create obstacles to information sharing. One of the first things Ukraine had to do in the face of Russian cyberattacks in 2022 was revoke its data localization rules and migrate data to the extraterritorially located cloud. There is a growing sense in Washington that digital sovereignty and cybersecurity are used as an excuse for protectionism (exacerbated by remarks from some senior European officials calling for an exclusion of U.S. cloud providers), but this is a dispute that can be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-ahead&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two principles that build on recent agreements can help guide transatlantic discussion to a mutually agreeable outcome:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-build-on-shared-values-established-in-the-oecd-declaration&quot;&gt;1. Build on shared values established in the OECD declaration.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the United States and European Union can build on the recent progress to build common understandings for sovereignty and for the requirements for streamlined access to digital evidence. There is an opportunity to build on the OECD’s Declaration on Government Access to Personal Data held by Private Sector Entities (agreed on in December 2022 after two years of negotiations). These joint principles apply to government activities, and for the United States, this includes requests made under the CLOUD Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The declaration marked the first intergovernmental agreement on “common approaches to safeguarding privacy and other human rights and freedoms when accessing personal data for national security and law enforcement purposes” and emphasized the countries’ “significant commonalities” on the topic. The principles include necessity, proportionality, transparency, oversight, and redress – areas that can be foundational in the creation of joint understandings between the United States and the European Union and a starting point for negotiations on a formal e-evidence agreement. These principles identify an emerging common language that can be built upon for a legally binding treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-use-the-eu-us-data-privacy-framework-as-a-model-for-joint-understandings&quot;&gt;2. Use the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework as a model for joint understandings.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent progress on the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework also points to joint understandings that can be key for the negotiation of an e-evidence agreement – the draft adequacy decision references U.S. criminal legal processes as providing adequate safeguards for European data. Prior to the implementation of these sovereignty requirements in the European Union, conversation with the United States on how to reach common ground will be key to EU innovation and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an open question as to whether pursuing CLOUD Act agreements with EU countries could be superseded by these agreements, and with the U.S.-EU discussion over data governance, there are encouraging signs. There are shared transatlantic concerns over crime and law enforcement which signal that agreement remains possible. The problem is not going away, and the outlines of a solution are visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 sent shockwaves around the world as states reacted to the return of high-intensity state-on-state conventional warfare on the European continent. Less attention has been paid to the unconventional aspects of this conflict – and yet, these are essential to understanding Russian actions and methods. The invasion itself can be seen as the intended culmination of a long unconventional campaign waged by Russia against Ukraine. The unconventional operations during the war have often been critical to Russia’s successive theories of victory, even as its conventional forces have failed to achieve their objectives on the battlefield. For those wishing to understand the Russian way of war and to learn lessons for their own defence, it is important to study this unconventional side of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unconventional warfare is defined for the purpose of this report as the conduct of covert and clandestine operations, psychological operations, subversion, sabotage, special operations and intelligence and counterintelligence activities aimed at contributing to a state’s military objectives. Describing these activities is complicated by the fact that Russian unconventional warfare fits within a distinct methodological tradition that uses precise but different terminology from other traditions. For example, in the US ‘unconventional warfare’ has a heavy weighting towards the sponsoring of non-state actors to overthrow a state. As shall be seen, the Russian attempt to subvert the Ukrainian state and thereby collapse resistance clearly fits within this concept of operations, but the combination of tools employed has a different weighting to what would normally be considered unconventional warfare. A consistent challenge in this special report is that Russian terminology for activities often has a very limited parallel in other traditions. On the whole – given that this is aimed at a NATO professional audience – this report uses British terms of art. Where it is necessary to use a specific Russian concept, this is explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report comprises two parts. The first spans Russia’s preparations and intentions as regards unconventional operations in Ukraine. It describes Russia’s agent network for conducting unconventional warfare in Ukraine, built up over many years, and then outlines how this network was intended to be used to enable the occupation and annexation of the country. The second part discusses how Russia used unconventional operations in light of how the war actually unfolded, including the counterintelligence regime on the occupied territories and the employment of special forces and irregular forces during the fighting. This report does not explore Russian operations in detail from 2014–21 but is instead focused on the build-up and execution of unconventional operations in support of the invasion in 2022. The aim is to detail Russia’s forms and methods, to enable them to be disrupted, and to provide an unclassified basis for discussing indicators, warnings and countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence from this report comes from extensive interviews – conducted both prior to and during the conflict – throughout Ukraine’s Intelligence Community, Security Services and Law Enforcement agencies. The report also draws on a large volume of material either captured on the battlefield in Ukraine or obtained elsewhere from Russia’s special services and the organisations and entities with which they interact. The evidence set deals with Russian activities observed between July 2021 and February 2023. Owing to the sensitivity of much of the evidence this report often necessarily extrapolates from incidents where it is possible to describe specific details to general patterns in Russian forms and methods. Where these extrapolations are made the authors have ensured that there is a consistent picture reported between Ukrainian agencies, available documentary evidence, and have in many instances checked the conclusions with non-Ukrainian agencies which are familiar with the forms and methods identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collection that targets organisations such as Russia’s special services is inherently fragmentary owing to the efforts these entities make to secure information on their activities. Writing about these subjects is further complicated by the sensitivities surrounding the evidence that has been collected and how it was obtained, which often prevents disclosure. The financial records of a front organisation for funding active measures, for example, may offer irrefutable evidence of an allegation that a body is funded by Russia’s special services. Declaring that such a document has been obtained, however, likely causes a change in funding arrangements disrupting future collection and will inevitably trigger an investigation by Russia’s special services into how such a document was obtained that may place a source at risk. A further methodological challenge is in being specific about the lessons to be drawn from a conflict. For instance, if a particular vulnerability is highlighted in Russian operations as implying a need to change the approaches of friendly services, this implies that friendly services adopt a similar form or use a similar method and potentially endangers their personnel. In navigating these dangers this report restricts its descriptions to general patterns and incidents rather than describing specific operations in detail. Where specific Russian activities are described, it is because it is deemed that the Russians know how such activities were identified. The report also focuses its analysis on the activities and vulnerabilities of the Russian conduct of unconventional warfare and does not describe how Russian successes or failures may require changes to the forms and methods of friendly services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this report is in places necessarily imprecise and far from comprehensive. Nevertheless, it is hoped that in outlining the scope and scale of Russia’s unconventional war against Ukraine, it will provide a useful resource for states that are targets of Russian unconventional operations to educate policymakers, strengthen societal resilience against Russian methods, disrupt Russian operations and prepare to deny the Russian special services opportunities in the event of hostilities. It is also hoped that understanding Russia’s unconventional operations will help to explain some of the more peculiar aspects of Russian decision-making and force employment of its conventional military during its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-the-theatre&quot;&gt;Setting the Theatre&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian plan for the occupation and annexation of Ukraine cannot be understood without appreciating the preconditions that Russia believed it had established through its protracted unconventional warfare against Kyiv. The strategy was premised on the orchestration of agents in place, built up over decades, but applied to a radically different policy from that for which most of Moscow’s assets had been recruited. As shall be detailed hereafter, Russia’s intended defeat mechanism was Ukraine’s internal destabilisation and disorganisation, which was supposed to disable the system of government and military command and control, undermine public trust in government institutions, reduce national stability and minimise aid to Ukraine from international partners. Under such conditions, the Russian military anticipated encountering little sustained or organised resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of proper logistics, the lack of fuel and ammunition, the vulnerability of long Russian convoys, poorly protected even from air raids, all indicate that Russia carried out the invasion as a military demonstration, without seriously considering the need to conduct full-fledged long-term combat operations. To a large extent, the small group of planners thought to repeat the success of the Crimean operation of 2014, which also made no sense from a military point of view and was planned based on the absence of military resistance from Ukraine. A vivid example of such neglect in February 2014 was the invasion of Ukrainian airspace by 11 Mi-24 combat helicopters and eight IL-76 military transport aircraft carrying Russian special forces to Crimea, which were not shot down by Ukrainian air defence only because the then leadership of the General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces refused to give an order. Russian attempts to land Russian airborne forces (VDV) on airfields near Kyiv in February 2022 fits perfectly into the same logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter, therefore, covers the structure of this agent network and how Russia intended to use it in the context of the full-scale invasion. Understanding why Russia thought it could succeed in this way is vital if such behaviour is to be deterred in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-agent-network&quot;&gt;Russia’s Agent Network&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FSB, which was deeply involved in the planning and execution of the invasion, appears to have been ordered to prepare plans to occupy Ukraine in July 2021. To do this the Fifth Service of the FSB took the 9th Section of the Department of Operational Information and turned it into a Directorate, increasing its staff from around two dozen personnel to over 200 reporting to Major General Igor Chumakov. The 9th Directorate was structured into oblast-facing sections along with thematic sections aimed at Ukraine’s parliament and another aimed at critical national infrastructure. The role of the Department for Operational Information is primarily planning, targeting and intelligence management: the assignment of priorities to handlers for their agents. The agents are not necessarily handled directly by the FSB Fifth Service. In the case of planning the occupation, therefore, the task of the 9th Directorate was not to establish and run an agent network, but rather to draw a detailed picture of the access achieved across Ukraine by Russia’s special services and then to plan how these existing agents were to be used during the invasion and subsequent occupation. Once this was done, it was necessary to provide instructions to agents’ established handlers as to what they were to ask their agents to do. This required meetings, and so in the autumn of 2021 Russian agents in Ukraine began to go on brief holidays at short notice to resorts in Turkey, Cyprus and Egypt where, coincidentally, they would meet with their handlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preferred method of Russia’s special services is – where possible – to minimise the running of agents from Russia and instead to recruit senior agents in place who run their own networks. The method of using such senior agents (agent-gruppovod) who build up client networks was highly recommended in Soviet classified manuals and instructions of the First Chief Directorate of the KGB (foreign intelligence service), and has remained the practice of the SVR, FSB Fifth Service and the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation – hereafter referred to as the GRU. If these individuals are politically, economically or bureaucratically senior in the target country, then they can recruit people not as Russian agents but as their personal clients who therefore unwittingly advance Russian interests. This is a form of false flag recruitment (verbovka na chuzhoi flag) where an agent may believe that they are being tasked on behalf of an official of their own country even though the taskings are ultimately contrived in Moscow. In the case of Ukraine, several senior officials and politicians performed this role – as shall be detailed shortly – having links with the Russian special services stretching decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internal destabilisation was attempted by agents of the Russian special services in Ukraine, including within the Ukrainian intelligence community, law enforcement agencies, other state authorities, political parties, public organisations and criminal organisations. Today, the Ukrainian intelligence community and its foreign partners have uncovered part of this agent network, which allows us to analyse the main tasks that the Russian leadership set for it, as well as to understand the main forms and methods it uses. At the same time, not all Russian agents and their operations have been exposed, and a significant part of Russia’s agents both in Ukraine and in other countries continue to actively operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andriy Derkach was a People’s Deputy in the Ukrainian Parliament with a long history of working with the Russians and advancing policies that aligned with Russian interests. He graduated from the Academy of the FSK (now FSB) in Moscow in 1993 before returning to Ukraine. His father was a senior KGB officer and for many years also head of Ukraine’s SBU. For several years Derkach headed Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear enterprise, during which time he signed several deals with Rosatom that created a dependency on the Russian nuclear industries. While this cannot be framed as espionage, the SBU was deeply concerned with his activities at that time and reported to then President Viktor Yushchenko about potential threats to Ukrainian national security. The head of Rosatom at that time was Sergei Kirienko, who is now first deputy head of the presidential administration of the Russian Federation and deeply involved in the coordination of Russian cross-government efforts on Ukraine’s occupied territories. It is believed by Ukraine’s intelligence community that influence on the Ukrainian nuclear energy industry in the interests of Russia and Rosatom was the main direction of Derkach’s pro-Russian activities before 2022. This would explain why Derkach is accused of being handled by Russia’s GRU, the primary responsibilities of which include the nuclear industry and Rosatom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s nuclear energy infrastructure played a significant role in Russia’s invasion plan and its public narratives about the conflict. As one of the justifications for aggression, the Kremlin publicly identified the threat that Ukraine plans to create its own nuclear weapons, and therefore one of the tasks of the Russian ‘special military operation’ was the denuclearisation of Ukraine, which included the intent to seize all nuclear power plants (NPPs), as well as some nuclear research centres. To prepare for these operations, the Russian special services recruited employees of nuclear facilities, including from units responsible for the physical security of the facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derkach’s first exposure as a Russian agent emerged when he participated in campaigns of covert influence aimed at undermining relations between Ukraine and the US. Thus, in 2019–20, Derkach made public several documents (most probably forged), as well as audio recordings of President Petro Poroshenko’s conversations with then US Vice-President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which suggested the presence of systematic US interference in the internal politics of Ukraine, and implied corrupt actions by high-ranking US officials in Ukraine. In 2020–21, the US Treasury Department imposed sanctions against Andriy Derkach for participating in a Russian foreign influence network, organising a disinformation campaign and meddling in US elections. According to the US government, at that time Derkach had been a Russian agent for over 10 years. In addition to Derkach, sanctions were also imposed on members of the Ukrainian parliament Oleksandr Dubinsky, Oleksandr Onishchenko, Prosecutor Kostyantyn Kulik, former Assistant to the Prosecutor General Andrii Telizhenko, and three other citizens of Ukraine. This group also tried to influence the US government. One of the tools of influence used for this purpose was an ‘anti-corruption group’ in the Ukrainian parliament, which was supposed to investigate the facts of corruption in the allocation of international aid to Ukraine. The ultimate goal of the anti-corruption investigation is believed to have been to stop or at least reduce international aid to Ukraine. Given Ukraine’s critical dependence on military-technical assistance from foreign partners, and above all assistance from the US, Russian special influence operations to worsen Ukraine’s relations with partner countries, and especially with the US, are a constant priority of the Russian special services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2022, the SBU made public the Derkach network, seizing a range of documents and outlining its assigned tasks. It appears that Derkach came under the control of the GRU in 2016 and was handled by General Vladimir Alekseev, the first deputy head of the service, and Admiral Igor Kostyukov, the head of the service. Derkach is alleged to have been tasked with the establishment of a network of private security firms which would assist in maintaining control in a number of towns by pathfinding and assisting Russian forces upon their arrival. For this purpose he is accused of receiving instalments of US$3–4 million per month from the GRU. Due to the need to preserve the secrecy of investigation, Ukrainian counterintelligence has not publicised additional information on what other functions Derkach had. At the same time it is clear that some of the most important Russian agents had close ties with Derkach and he could be directly involved in the recruitment of the most high-ranking Ukrainian officials in Russia’s agent network, in particular in the Ukrainian special services and parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, SBU Major General Oleg Kulinich, detained by counterintelligence in June 2022, also worked as Andriy Derkach’s deputy at Energoatom in the past and is a close friend of his family. Kulinich, who worked in the office of the Head of the Security Service of Ukraine, is accused of transferring data constituting a state secret to the Russian special services, exerting influence on the higher state leadership of Ukraine, recruiting other employees of the special services, as well as aiding the capture of the south of Ukraine, in particular by suppressing the information available in Ukrainian intelligence collection about the preparation of the invasion of the mainland from the Crimean peninsula. The main task of the Kulinich group was to weaken the national security system, in particular, the ability of counterintelligence to effectively detect Russian agents and to mislead the top military and political leadership of Ukraine about the true state of internal and external threats, the collection and transmission of information to the Russian special services about the defence system of southern Ukraine, the location of military objects, and personal data of employees of the Ukrainian special services and members of their families, as well as undercover agents and assets of the Ukrainian special services that operated in the occupied territories and the territory of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of his tasks, Kulinich is alleged to have exerted influence on behalf of Russia to shape the adoption of personnel and management decisions in the SBU system and other state authorities of Ukraine. In particular, thanks to his influence, Brigadier General Andrii Naumov, who is also accused of treason, was appointed to the position of head of the Main Directorate of Internal Security of the SBU (which supervises all SBU employees and can carry out surveillance, wiretapping and other special measures against SBU officers as part of its investigations). It is noteworthy that, among other things, Ukrainian law enforcement agencies accuse General Naumov of passing on secret information about the security system of the Chornobyl NPP to the Russian special services, where Naumov worked in the management for a long time. This information was used by the Russian troops during the seizure of the Chornobyl NPP and when using the Chornobyl disaster exclusion zone to launch an attack on Kyiv. Using his influence, Kulinich tried to secure the appointment of Naumov to the post of First Deputy Head of the SBU. One of the motives was to take control of the Counterintelligence Department of the SBU. Naumov left Ukraine a few hours before the Russian invasion and was detained in June 2022 in Serbia while crossing the border for the undeclared importation of a large amount of cash. According to the investigation, Kulinich was in contact with ex-Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine and ex-Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Volodymyr Sivkovich (a former KGB employee who is under US sanctions), who fled Ukraine after the Revolution of Dignity and permanently lives in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the other tasks that Major General Kulinich is alleged to have received from the FSB through Sivkovich was to exert influence on the higher political leadership of Ukraine to convince it of the need to abandon the course of joining NATO and to adopt a neutral status just prior to the invasion. Refusal to join NATO, according to the Russian special services’ plan, along with other Ukrainian concessions to Russia, should have been the impetus for anti-government protests, similar to the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, when President Yanukovych refused to integrate Ukraine into the EU. Mass protests were intended to simplify the task of the Russian special services to destabilise Ukraine internally and paralyse the system of state and military administration, providing the conditions for a Russian military invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task of setting the conditions for violent protest was exposed when, in January 2022, the Ministry of Internal Affairs arrested Colonel Yuriy Goluban of the Ukrainian National Police, formerly a member of the SBU’s Alpha unit, responsible for direct action. While serving in the Donetsk branch of SBU Alpha in 2014, Goluban had joined a pro-Russian militia, as part of the command of the Donetsk People’s Republic’s battalion ‘Vostok’. However, he successfully concealed these activities and later returned to Ukraine, joining the national police. Prior to the invasion, Ukrainian law enforcement accuses him of receiving money to organise protests in Kyiv and three other oblasts at which extreme right-wing symbols would be prevalent and in which the protesters would accuse the government of failing to confront the threat from Russia. The intent was to infiltrate these protests with paid criminals and agent provocateurs to spark violent confrontations with the police. The original idea was to present the protests as an attempted ‘far-right coup’ and to use them as a justification for the invasion. It was also intended to sow internal instability among the Ukrainian resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Russians were setting the conditions for street violence and internal destabilisation under an openly pro-Russia flag, in a manner consistent with their preferred approach of supporting extremes against the centre to drive polarisation and therefore control. This activity is alleged to have been orchestrated by a group around Viktor Medvechuk, leader of the OPZZH Party, and fellow members of parliament including Viktor Chornyi and Ilya Kiva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before joining the pro-Russia camp in 2019, Kiva pretended to be a radical Ukrainian nationalist known for his aggressive Russophobia. Immediately after the Revolution of Dignity, Kiva joined the leadership of the paramilitary organisation Right Sector, and soon after joined the National Police of Ukraine, where he headed the Department of Anti-Drug Trafficking, as well as the trade union of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In 2020, as part of Medvedchuk’s group, he created and headed the organisation Patriots for Life, which consisted mostly of representatives of martial arts clubs, criminals (including drug dealers) and former employees of special police units (including those who were dismissed for crimes during the Revolution of Dignity). The basis of the organisation was the representatives of the Combat Sambo Federation of Ukraine, the martial art of Soviet special bodies, whose honorary president was Viktor Medvedchuk himself. The task of the organisation is believed to have been to create provocations during mass events, as well as to radicalise the socio-political situation in Ukraine, including by provoking a violent confrontation with representatives of pro-Ukrainian organisations. After the Russian invasion of 2022, members of the organisation moved to illegal status and performed various tasks for the Russian special services in support of the Russian invasion. A similar model was also used by the Russians before the 2014 aggression, when the Oplot organisation, which also consisted of a mixture of athletes, criminals and law enforcement officers, was first used for violence against opponents of the Yanukovych regime, and later became the basis for the formation of Russian proxy forces in Donetsk. As with Derkach, Medvedchuk’s group also controlled security firms and detective agencies. Member of parliament Viktor Chornyi was responsible for this direction in the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Naumov was travelling with a renowned smuggler when he was arrested crossing the Serbian border speaks to a much wider phenomenon in Russia’s agent networks in Ukraine. Beneath the senior agents in the Ukrainian government there was a large support apparatus. This apparatus has been used for a wide range of functions, from reconnaissance to basic movement of cash, equipment, or the setting up of safe houses. In some cases, this includes Ukrainian citizens who have a loyalty to Russia. In many cases, however, the individuals in question are paid agents drawn from organised criminal networks. For years prior to the full-scale invasion, the Ukrainian Border Guard Service noted close relationships between Russian officers and smuggler networks across all of Ukraine’s borders. Often, however, the support apparatus did not need to conduct such covert activity. The movement of cash, for example, was easily facilitated either through the diplomatic bag of Russia’s allies before the invasion, or simply through the large number of companies owned by Russian agents in Ukraine, some of whose workers could set up channels for siphoning money to operations. It is important to note that while the support apparatus was less important for Russia’s invasion plans, it persists and is a critical enabler of ongoing Russian activity on Ukrainian territory. The one body of ideologically committed agents supporting the invasion was the Russian Orthodox Church. Beyond its efforts to support Russian information operations, its priests were widely recruited and run by the Russian special services and their monasteries and churches used as safe houses for equipment and personnel. The use of religion as cover is not only a widely established method of the Russian special services but also creates its own protection mechanism because of the political sensitivities of state targeting of religious institutions. For this reason, it took some time for the Ukrainian state to move to constrain the activities of these parts of Russia’s support apparatus even after the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These various strands of effort were coordinated by Volodymyr Sivkovich, the former deputy head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, who fled to Russia in 2014. On 20 January 2022, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken specifically singled out Sivkovich as central to FSB plans to handle senior Ukrainian agents. Sivkovich appears to have functioned as the handler for these senior Ukrainian officials reporting directly to Igor Chumakov in the 9th Directorate of the FSB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assessing-the-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-the-network&quot;&gt;Assessing the Strengths and Weaknesses of the Network&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the extent of Russia’s efforts – only a fraction of which are outlined above – it is noteworthy that Russia failed to bring about the destabilisation its plan called for. Even with the presence of powerful agents in state authorities, as well as prepared structures that could be involved in internal destabilisation, Russia has not managed to foment an internal political crisis in Ukraine. First, it was not possible to achieve the main prerequisites for full-scale protests. Despite pressure and influence, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not agree to renounce Ukraine’s bid for membership of NATO and make other concessions to Russia unacceptable to the majority of Ukrainians. Second, as part of intelligence sharing, Western intelligence services transmitted to Ukraine not only information about Russia’s preparations for a military invasion, but also about Russian intentions to destabilise Ukraine internally, as well as about persons who directly participated in it. Public release of information about such intentions was also an important element of neutralising Russian efforts. Nevertheless, despite senior Russian intelligence officials recommending the invasion be delayed until the summer of 2022 because the necessary conditions were not met, Moscow proceeded with its invasion. Russia’s belief that it understood Ukrainian politics may have been bolstered by the number of senior former Ukrainian officials resident in Moscow who had a clear motive in telling the Kremlin to proceed. According to information held by the SBU, the following representatives of the Yanukovych regime also cooperate with the Russian special services on a regular basis: ex-Minister of Defence Pavlo Lebedev; ex-head of the SBU Oleksandr Yakymenko; ex-Minister of Internal Affairs Vitaly Zakharchenko; and Andriy Klyuev, ex-head of the Presidential Administration. During the years working in the Ukrainian government, such persons had practically unlimited opportunity to infiltrate their own agents in all state bodies and to extract whatever information interested them. Nevertheless, Moscow’s decision to proceed without the necessary preconditions suggests two things: first, that Russia’s agents were exaggerating their influence on the Ukrainian state; and, second, that the Russian special services had been ordered to facilitate an occupation to a timeline, not to assess its viability. In other words, that the next phase of Russia’s plan proceeded even though the previous phase had not yet succeeded speaks to a command-driven process from the top and an institutional culture of following orders rather than the provision of honest advice from Russia’s special services to the executive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, until the last moment before the invasion, the Russian agents were preparing for the organisation of internal destabilisation, and the structures they created in Ukraine for this purpose were practically unprepared and unsuitable for use in the conditions of a long-term, full-scale military conflict – for example, as sabotage groups that could operate in the deep. Moreover, Russian military aggression and crimes against the civilian population have changed the attitude towards Russia not only among ordinary Ukrainians, but also among representatives of pro-Russian organisations. Even in the case of the Patriots for Life organisation, some members publicly condemned Russian aggression. Similar processes took place in 2014, when veteran structures created in Ukraine by the GRU (mostly along the lines of Dmitriy Sablin’s organisation ‘Boevoe bratstvo’) and the FSB (such as organisations of KGB special forces and organisations of Afghanistan veterans) after the start of the military conflict mostly remained loyal to Ukraine and even joined the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians recruited penetrations of the Ukrainian state at a senior level across its institutions. These penetrations were able to mobilise large numbers of subordinates to follow their instructions without necessarily knowing that they were working to further Russian interests. The networks centred on a core nucleus of senior officials who had interlinked histories and were mutually supporting. Yet, despite these successes, the FSB’s plans failed and it is important to understand why. Many had anticipated that the Ukrainian state would fragment from within. This did not happen, and many of these networks were disrupted or had key members detained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few observations about the Russian forms and methods employed reveals the strengths and vulnerabilities of their approach. It is likely that even these senior agents knew relatively little about the overall invasion plan, which was kept to a very small group of planners. While they may have surmised the overall thrust from what they were asked to do, it is not evident that they were read in. Most individuals who these principal agents controlled would have known much less. Prior to the invasion, it may be argued that the Russians maintained an extensive and robust network in Ukraine. Many conducting supportive tasks for the Russian special services would have thought they were following the instructions of a Ukrainian official. Those conducting illegal activities on behalf of Russian agents were often doing so under financial incentives. But the risk – hypothetically – for an employee of the national police in providing information to a Ukrainian official in another government department for a fee would be negligible and the financial reward potentially welcome. The problem for the Russians was that, first, the full-scale invasion fundamentally altered the context within which their unwitting agents, or agents recruited under false flags who lacked any ideological commitment to their cause, were judging the harms of operating under Russian control. The same police officer, for example, appreciating that the information they were asked to provide may be used to guide Russian tanks into Ukraine’s cities, may be less willing to have anything to do with the Russians and may see the risks of discovery as greater than the reward of some money. A criminal who previously saw little harm in acting as a courier across the Russo-Ukrainian border may nevertheless feel that they must protect their family if it is coming under air attack. Many of the networks therefore became unreliable in the early days of the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unreliability of the networks would likely have mattered much less if the Russian military had secured its immediate objectives. In a scenario where the Russian military was in control of Ukrainian cities and Russia’s principal agents were issued clear instructions for their networks, it is likely that the risk–reward calculus would have seen significant levels of collaboration achieved. Instead, as Russian troops failed to take their objectives, many networks either froze in place to be activated later or dissolved, as members of the network lost any incentive to work with Russia and broke contact with their handlers. Many agents remained in place, enabling reconnaissance, but could offer little by way of disruption. Most of the FSB’s planning had been premised on physically controlling the terrain and there was a lack of command and control for the unwitting agents recruited previously in a scenario where the FSB did not have a physical presence on the ground. However, while the Russian plan unravelled, it was not entirely flawed. In the areas where the Russians did occupy the ground, they demonstrated that they could build up a sufficient body of collaborators to exert control and run a robust counterintelligence apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-plan-of-activation&quot;&gt;The Plan of Activation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before detailing how Russia ended up using its agent network it is important to understand how it was intended to support the occupation of Ukraine. This is vital because, even though it differs from how events actually unfolded, the Russian invasion plan does not make sense without understanding Moscow’s intended defeat mechanism of the Ukrainian state. The difficulties experienced by the Russian military therefore cannot be understood without appreciating what Russian planners expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 24 February 2022, when Russian forces moved over the border, troops of the Eastern Military District confronted a detachment of Ukraine’s national guard responsible for securing the Chornobyl NPP. Seeking instructions, the detachment contacted Valentin Vitter, head of the plant’s security, who advised them to surrender – both to save their own lives given the disparity in force between them and the Russians, and to prevent damage to the facility. The plant was seized within two hours without a fight. This was not an isolated incident but recurred throughout southern Ukraine in the first days of the war. A similar process was also simultaneously attempted across the entire Ukrainian government, but to less effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the opening hours of the invasion, senior Russian officials phoned their Ukrainian counterparts to urge passivity to avoid bloodshed. Dmitry Kozak, for example, deputy chief of staff of the Russian Presidential Administration and head of the Committee for Transborder Cooperation intimately involved in the build-up of agent networks in Ukraine, phoned the Ukrainian Presidential Administration and urged surrender. On 25 February 2022, Putin publicly appealed to the Ukrainian military not to resist the Russian invasion, and instead to conduct a mutiny, to negotiate an end to the war with Russia. On 26 February, the Belarusian defence minister phoned his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksiy Reznikov, and conveyed a Russian offer to accept Ukraine’s surrender from Sergei Shoigu. On 22 February, the Belarusian defence minister had been involved in Russia’s wider attempt to deceive the Ukrainian government as to its intentions, personally assuring Reznikov that he would not allow an invasion to proceed from Belarusian territory. Over the first three days of the invasion, all of Ukraine’s General Officers received text messages or phone calls, often from counterparts on the Russian side whom they knew personally, to urge their inactivity to prevent bloodshed. Ukrainian officers at the rank of colonel meanwhile almost all received text messages urging inactivity or surrender, though these did not originate from known contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reporting about this outreach has often suggested that this Russian activity was supposed to bring about surrender of the higher levels of the Ukrainian state. This is to misunderstand the defeat mechanism. While a total surrender of Ukraine would have been desirable, the actual process by which the Russians anticipated occupation of the country was premised on the paralysis of the central Ukrainian apparatus combined with localised surrender of isolated Ukrainian units. The Russians mistakenly appear to have projected on to Ukraine the same top-down command culture of their own forces. A large portion of the middle echelon of officials that were Russian agents simply stopped responding to messages early in the invasion or else abandoned their posts, severing chains of command from the central government to tactical units. The advocacy towards Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to leave Kyiv and a wide range of other proposals that emerged from the bureaucracy were largely aimed at imposing decision paralysis on the centre. Meanwhile, Russia’s agents tried to convince local commanders and officials not to resist. They did not do this by presenting themselves as speaking on behalf of the Russians, but instead cited the local disparity in forces and the desire to save Ukrainian lives. The aim was to slow down a decision to resist for long enough to allow Russian forces to occupy key strategic centres. Resistance in this framework would be sporadic and isolated. In this context, the model for the wider Russian invasion plan may be observed in southern Ukraine – where it proved much more successful. Furthermore, since the task of Russia’s agents was to isolate Ukrainian units through obstruction and encourage junior paralysis and surrender, many of them withdrew their work from the government rather than actively operating to participate in the occupation. The intent was that they would emerge once the territory was occupied, rather than engage in some sort of coup or direct action before occupation was achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, that most Russian efforts were aimed at fixing and fragmenting resistance can be seen in the use of information and cyber attacks in the first days of the war. Rather than target critical national infrastructure or seek to inflict direct damage on Ukrainian systems – which was attempted later – the initial cyber attacks were largely aimed at communications systems that the Ukrainian state relied on. On the whole, they were unsuccessful because of the preparations made by the Ukrainian State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection. However, an example of a successful attack was against the company Viasat, which disrupted communications on the first day of the invasion, and highlights the primary object of much of these activities. The Russians were also partially successful in terms of information warfare, isolating Ukrainian communities through the release of misleading narratives aimed towards the mobilised civilians who the Ukrainian state armed to secure rear areas. These narratives emphasised the prevalence of sabotage groups and infiltrators: for example, the Russians started messages on Ukrainian social media calling for citizens to report suspicious markings on buildings. The result was a deluge of false positives swamping the capacity of Ukrainian law enforcement. This mirrored a persistent tactic from before the war whereby the Russian special services would make continual false bomb threats to Ukrainian law enforcement. Another consequence of amplifying paranoia was to instil fear into Territorial Defence Detachments and encourage incidents of friendly fire or at the very least slow down the movement of Ukrainian troops and officials through checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final critical element is that the one part of the Russian invasion plan where obstruction, isolation and negotiated capitulation could not be achieved in theory was Ukraine’s air defence system. Given the importance of projecting resupply and reinforcements by air into Ukraine, this had to be suppressed. Moreover, the striking of air defences and industry had a shock and awe value intended to encourage passivity. Thus, the one overtly planned conventional military component of the Russian campaign was the suppression and destruction of Ukraine’s air defences by the VKS and through a massive missile strike campaign using cruise and ballistic missiles. In the south, where older Ukrainian air defence systems were less mobile, this was largely successful. Elsewhere the Russians achieved the suppression and displacement of the air defences for several hours and, in some directions, it lasted for around 24 hours. Generally, however, the lack of appropriate training and equipment for this mission in the VKS meant that this effort failed and Ukrainian air defences recovered over the following two days. Given that Russia’s ground forces were intended to have occupied most of their key objectives within 72 hours, however, this would have been less problematic if the ground forces had not failed utterly to bypass or fight through Ukrainian troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the foremost causes of inaccuracy in pre-war military assessments of the likely trajectory of the fighting – both in NATO countries and in the Ukrainian military – stems from the assumption that the Russian forces would conduct a deliberate military offensive. For example, it was assumed that rail and logistics infrastructure would be targeted. Instead, because the aim was to fix and isolate Ukrainian units, there was very little attempt to destroy them in the first three days. The whole logic of the employment of forces was premised on the success of Russia’s unconventional operations and yet, as already discussed, the preconditions for that success in terms of the political destabilisation of Ukraine had not yet been achieved. There remains an unanswered question as to why the Russian leadership decided to begin the invasion without establishing the required preconditions. This may be understood as a strategic error of judgement by Putin personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk of Russia’s planning focused on what to do after the invasion. The details of the counterintelligence regime on the occupied territories is covered in the next section as these were observable in operation in those areas that were captured. Nevertheless, there was an element of the occupation plan that did not come to pass – the occupation of Kyiv – which also includes the intended use of special forces in the original invasion plan. As already outlined, the Russians intended to occupy Kyiv within 72 hours. The intent was for initial units to secure the main routes into the city and for airborne troops to then be flown to Hostomel airfield and to move to secure key zones within the city. Within each city sector these forces would provide cordons to control the movement of the population. The conventional Russian forces would then transition to screening and isolating the city, controlling the countryside and preventing reinfiltration by Ukrainian conventional detachments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind these troops were to come Russian Special Forces (SSO) and troops intended for repressive operations including the Rosgvardia – and in particular the Chechen Rosgvardia (Kadyrovtsy). The assignment of these troops to key roles on seized territory explains the relatively small level of infiltration and sabotage against military sites attempted in the opening phase of the conflict, which was anticipated as a standard element of Russian doctrine practised extensively in previous conflicts. Instead, most Spetsnaz deployed in conventional reconnaissance roles ahead of the battalion tactical groups, while special forces were largely intended to sweep in behind. The Russians were so confident that they would succeed in hours that their support apparatus had rented apartments around the key sites from which their special forces were supposed to operate in Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in Kyiv, the plan included three interconnected directions of operation. The first was the use of local agents to guide Russian SSO in capturing the executive and parliamentary leadership of the country. These were likely to be given show trials. Separately, the Kadyrovtsy were to engage in the hunting down of the Ukrainians believed to be organisers of patriotic resistance and those associated with the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. This was anticipated to be a dirty war, comparable to the conflict with the Chechen rebels following the fall of Grozny in 2000. The third line of effort was to be the pacification of the population. This depended on the isolation of communities through the control of egress and ingress through natural choke points in civic infrastructure. Within these isolated areas, the Rosgvardia were to manage protests and acts of civil resistance. There would not necessarily need to be violent suppression of protests, but the organisers of such protests could be identified and subsequently targeted by the Kadyrovtsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further task for SSO and VDV units was the seizure of Ukraine’s central bank, water and utilities, and the parliament. The intent was to allow Viktor Medvedchuk and other members of the Russian-aligned faction within the Ukrainian parliament to establish a movement for peace, to pass resolutions urging surrender to save lives and to save Ukraine, and thereafter to govern through the national parliament and through the regional parliaments and local administrations. The withdrawal of power, utilities and finance from regions that were considered problematic would be used to try and further isolate areas of persistent instability. Within this context, the foremost advocates for peace and therefore candidates for local government office throughout the country would be those officials who were part of the agent network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems with this plan are succinctly summarised by Lieutenant General Reshetnikov of the SVR, who observed that ‘the miscalculations were mostly political, as well as military: underestimation of the enemy, misunderstanding of the mood and functioning of this territory. There were, most likely, unjustified hopes. We were going to enter Kyiv, Kharkov, to bring to power reasonable representatives of the Ukrainian state. But what happened, happened’. The following chapter concerns what happened in those areas that the Russians succeeded in occupying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-unconventional-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;The Unconventional War in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having considered Russia’s preparations, the extent of its capabilities in Ukraine, and how it had conceptualised employing them, it is now possible to outline how these plans unfolded in practice and what can be learned about the forms and methods of the Russian special services when operating in the context of a large-scale conventional conflict. This should be considered in three parts: the functioning of the counterintelligence regime on the occupied territories; the use of special operations forces and irregular troops in combat; and the collection, analysis and dissemination of combat-relevant intelligence. This chapter will explore each of these topics in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-counterintelligence-regime-on-the-occupied-territories&quot;&gt;The Counterintelligence Regime on the Occupied Territories&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians implemented their occupation plan in the areas that they seized, allowing for the details of how it functioned in practice and its effectiveness to be studied. For each of the oblasts targeted for occupation, the FSB formed Temporary Operational Groups (TOGs) tasked with coordinating the occupation regime and its counterintelligence apparatus. Each TOG was commanded by an officer from the 9th Directorate of the Department of Operational Information of the FSB Fifth Service. The individual would usually be drawn from the section that had been tasked with targeting the oblast that they were to administer. In Ukraine these individuals operated under false names, which were usually generic. They would usually have a pair of deputies from the Fifth Service and beneath this core command group representatives from the other FSB services including counterintelligence, military counterintelligence and the FSB service responsible for the protection of infrastructure. They would also have a support staff. Each TOG was assigned detachments of Rosgvardia for cordoning and public order, Alpha detachments and other special forces troops for conducting raids, and troops including Chechen Rosgvardia detachments intended to conduct the elimination of high-value targets. This was a model that had been employed in and refined since the Second Chechen War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach to establishing the occupation administration was systematic. In the first instance, Russian forces were tasked with seizing all forms of records. This included public health, education, housing, tax, police, electoral and local government records. One of the first acts upon seizing the Chornobyl and Zaporizhzhia NPPs was the seizing of all hard drives from these sites. It also included private records from utility companies, insurance providers and NGOs. This data would be used to build a map of who was supposed to live where, who they were related to and whether they had any connections with the Ukrainian state. The population was divided into five core categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those deemed leaders of Ukrainian nationalism who were specified for physical liquidation on a high-priority target list, or for capture to enable show trials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those suspected of intending to support acts of resistance who needed to be recruited or suppressed including anyone associated with Ukrainian law enforcement, local government, the military or related to officials that were not actively collaborating.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those who were deemed apathetic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those actively collaborating with Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Individuals who were necessary for running critical national infrastructure and had to be controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within each town the TOG would appoint a garrison commander from the Russian military who would have an assigned detachment of garrison troops. These troops would occupy a building – usually the police or fire station – and set up facilities for detention, processing, interrogation and torture. The fact that the layout of these facilities is consistent throughout the country, and the equipment used in torture chambers, including specialised electrocution machines, were the same across multiple oblasts demonstrates that this was a systematic plan and not improvised sadism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the occupied areas different parts of the counterintelligence apparatus would begin to carry out their assigned tasks. Civic leaders including the owners of public utilities, schools and factories would be summoned to meet with a representative from the TOG and told that they must either collaborate in continuing to discharge their duties while reporting to the TOG or, in the case of educational institutions, enforcing curriculum changes, or they must resign. Among teachers in particular, if a school head was removed, the position was often offered to other staff if they were prepared to collaborate. If no collaborators could be found or the loyalty of a collaborator was suspected then these staff were usually replaced by a Russian who, in the case of public utilities, was usually an FSB officer from the service responsible for the protection of infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another part of the occupation administration was the information isolation of the communities being targeted. This was done in three ways. First, the Russian military would jam the frequencies by which people in the occupied area could access Ukrainian television and radio. Second, the telecommunications infrastructure was severed from Ukrainian infrastructure and reconnected to Russian infrastructure, enabling monitoring of telecommunication and internet traffic. Third, listening posts and metadata analysis against cellular telephones was set up to monitor the communications of local residents, prioritising those who attempted to route calls or messages from the occupied territories to the rest of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, garrisons were tasked with conducting house-to-house sweeps. This involved military units inspecting houses to confirm that the records seized accurately recorded who was at each address. They also searched homes for insignia, medals or uniforms indicating whether residents had previously had connections with the Ukrainian state and examined photographs and other personal effects to confirm the relationships between residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The occupation administrations and garrisons were aided in their activities by members of local law enforcement and civil servants recruited before the war as agents of the Russian special services. It is important to note that some pre-war assessments anticipated that these individuals would essentially seize local governments and thereafter hand them over to the Russians. In practice, there were far fewer recruited agents, and these were much too junior to bring about such an effect in most towns. Of the 800 Russian agents identified in the occupied parts of Kharkiv oblast, for example, the majority were junior officials in local government including in departments such as the forestry commission. Fewer than 100 local law enforcement officers collaborated. The Russians did not expect these individuals to simply continue running the oblast. Instead, they provided a network of informants and enablers who could perform several important functions. First, they had alerted the Russians to where repositories of documents were and could provide vital local knowledge about the community and its environs. Second, by reporting on the conduct of officials who had remained in place but were not directly collaborating, they could flag to the occupation authorities those who were apathetic as compared to those who might be actively working with the Ukrainian state or with resistance networks. A head teacher who said they would teach the new modules supplied by the TOG, for example, would be reported by a recruited agent in the school if they did not comply. In practice – as in the previously occupied areas of Crimea, and Luhansk and Donetsk – collaborators were a relatively small group but played an enabling role. The important point is that the FSB did not expect or require as part of its planning that the majority – or even a significant part of the population – welcomes it. Based on its experiences in Chechnya, the planning assumption was that 8% of the population needed to collaborate, whether proactively or under coercion, to enable the counterintelligence regime to be effective. The Ukrainian intelligence community, based on assessments of those areas where the Russians did establish control, concluded that the FSB was broadly correct in its requirements for local support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control through such a small part of the population could be asserted through violence. It is important to understand how violence was used, as it was applied differently to different targets. First, for those on the high-priority target list identified as Ukrainian nationalists the intent was to kill or capture them – spearheaded by Chechen units and the FSB. Because the Russians did not overrun Kyiv, Odesa, central Kharkiv and other major cities, most of the individuals on this list were beyond Russia’s reach and have remained so throughout the war, reducing the prominence of these activities. For those in senior positions or responsible for critical national infrastructure who were not active collaborators, the Russians worked to build leverage over them. In most cases this was first achieved through direct intimidation. Mayors, for example, were often taken in for questioning and received beatings, only to be released. Additionally, many persons in this category had members of their family detained and tortured. It was usually made clear to the person who was a target for leverage that other members of their family could also be detained, or the detained family members tortured further, if they did not comply with Russian instructions. This was also done by targeting Ukrainian officials within Ukrainian-controlled territory who had family members on the occupied territories. Generally speaking, the purpose of torture was to build leverage, evident from both the communications sent by the TOG to the target and as the victim was not subjected to questioning during or after their torture, but was simply tortured and then released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those suspected of being involved or likely to become involved in resistance, the process was more protracted and the outcome more varied. Those with ties to the Ukrainian state were detained and went through a process of filtration. This would usually begin with interrogation. Occasionally initial interrogations would involve violence and in a majority of cases there was a threat of escalation if the individuals were subsequently found to be conspiring against the occupation administration. Initial interrogation questions appear to have been formulaic and basic. Nevertheless, by building a picture of backgrounds, the FSB was laying the groundwork for network analysis. For individuals of concern the interrogation process was often escalated with a second round, sometimes conducted under torture. Here, the interrogators made use of the electrocution equipment established in the detention facilities and the questions would move from basic formulas to a more detailed examination of the individual. Some would be released after this process; others would be moved to facilities elsewhere, or in Russia itself, for further rounds of interrogation. Part of the logic of this displacement was that, if suspects were released after being displaced, they would have been separated from their friends and family. Thus, when they returned, it would be unclear to Ukrainian resistance networks whether they had been doubled and were now informing. A condition of release was often the provision of routine reports to the FSB. Moreover, their support network and contacts could thereby be examined as they invariably made contact with their closer friends upon their return to try and seek assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of filtration bore a remarkable resemblance to activities carried out under the Russian Ministry of Interior’s Directive 247 of 1994, a legally non-binding administrative decree issued during the First Chechen War which authorised the military to set up filtration points. Those passing through initial rounds of filtration would be documented and returned to their communities. Those deemed concerning could be detained and removed to filtration camps for further questioning and, in this process, separated from their families and support networks. Underpinning this system of repression in Ukraine was data. At the garrison level, most interrogation records and data were either held in separate databases or else were on paper or on laptops. They were not integrated datasets. Over time, however, as these case files on individuals expanded and as people were moved for interrogation, these files became more complex. Detainees describe how by their third interrogation it was evident that the questioning had shifted from formulaic questions, in the first round, to case-specific questions in the second round, and then questions that cross referenced with other’s case files by the third round. This cross referencing demonstrates that a counterintelligence indexing system was being used to build a network map of the population, allowing for interrogations to be crosschecked for consistency. By the time these datasets reached the TOG at the oblast level, there is evidence that data was ingested into ‘Spectrum’. Spectrum is the FSB’s digital architecture for its security and counterintelligence work on Russian territory. It ingests data from other Russian government bodies such as tax and court records, and police and border guards reports, as well as from other FSB systems such as ‘Magistral’, designed to harvest flight and shipping manifests, and SORM – the System for Operative Investigative Activities. Other sources of information include ‘PSKOV’, used for mobile phone tracking, billing and social media monitoring and ‘Sherlock’, an all-source database, including social media, mobile phone data and finances, which fuses various streams of government, commercially available and stolen data. Spectrum is essentially an app that functions as a portal to access several databases hosted on a range of commercially derived systems. Using Spectrum also allowed all FSB officers with the right permissions to draw on these interrogation reports and case files as the individuals moved around Russian-occupied territory or Russian territory. Thus, whereas when a suspect was detained their case file had to physically follow them, to be held by the detaining officers, the digitisation of the records ensured that the case files would always be available to FSB officers if an individual came to its attention again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the campaign of intimidation and suppression was collective punishment. In many towns occupied by Russian forces, local citizens either filmed them and uploaded the videos on to social media or else passed details about Russian troop movements to friends, family and the Ukrainian state. This was collected by the Ukrainian military and used for artillery targeting. In response, Russian troops conducted sweeps of all residents and examined their phones to establish whether they were sharing information with the Ukrainian military. If they were, then these individuals were detained and interrogated, often tortured, and in many cases executed. It is also important to note that Russian troops tasked with this were often scared and not especially thorough in their checks, preferring to detain on suspicion rather than on the discovery of proof. Many innocent civilians were therefore detained, tortured and murdered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brutality of Russian troops was not confined to those areas where there were ongoing Ukrainian artillery strikes. Even in those areas where no strikes were taking place, acts of resistance would often lead to apparently random people being lifted for interrogation in numbers. In some communities this essentially led many residents not to go out except for essentials. Given that this pattern was repeated in many towns, it seems systematic and to follow a cruel logic that, if acts of resistance bring about collective punishment, then those wishing to resist must not only factor in the risk to themselves but also the risk to their families, friends and community. The collapse in local businesses, social spaces and community also has a secondary effect. In towns where repression fractured normal life, the Russian occupation administration came to control shops, food distribution and services. Access to these things could be controlled, creating another coercive lever to not only suppress opposition but also to encourage collaboration. Fracturing a community enabled calculations of self-interest to force the local population to interact with, depend on and enable against its will the perpetuation of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These processes – integrating data from the occupied territories into the systems supporting Russian domestic repression, and displacing people into Russia itself – are consistent with Russia’s intent to eventually annex the occupied territory. The process of annexation was to be the same as had been applied to Crimea. First, a proportion of the population would be recruited or coerced into collaborating in the running of the local administration. Second, the area would be secured from military threats by the Russian military and from resistance activities by the harsh repressive measures. Third, this security would enable the wider elements of the FSB and Russian state apparatus to move on to the territory including law enforcement. Fourth, the collaborators in the local administration would be appointed to positions in rural and dispersed parts of Russia and replaced with Russians to directly administer the territory. Finally, the territory would be annexed. This process was not fully implemented because of the poor progress of the Russian military but did begin to be put into effect in Mariupol and other towns out of range of Ukrainian indirect fire. Beyond this point it was assessed that while resistance and sporadic insurgency might continue – as in Chechnya – it would not pose a threat to Russian control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-irregulars&quot;&gt;The Irregulars&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the invasion, the expectation was that Russia’s special forces would be employed in the conduct of strategic reconnaissance and special reconnaissance actions. As outlined, most of the relevant troops were instead held back to support the occupation administrations. When the occupation of much of the target territory failed, these troops were neither in position to fulfil their traditional role nor able to fulfil the role specified in the invasion plan. The actual employment of these troops therefore bears consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the number of Spetsnaz units in Russian formations had been expanding rapidly. Most military analysts anticipated that this would lead to Russian formations having a much stronger reconnaissance and direct action capability organic to their brigades. In the Second Chechen War, and in Syria, the Russian military had extensively employed Spetsnaz as reconnaissance troops to screen its advances and in other special forces roles. This was done for some formations during the invasion. For example, Spetsnaz punched into Kharkiv significantly ahead of the conventional forces. Although these formations could have been employed more widely in this way, the expansion of Spetsnaz units had contributed to a shortage of competent contract infantry for the wider Russian military – as most competent infantry had been pushed toward Spetsnaz and airborne units. For the invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin limited the number of conscripts in its battalion tactical groups, while the size of the invasion force prevented the concentration of personnel from across the force to bring those units committed to their full complement. As a result, many Battlegroups were significantly under strength. Russian armoured personnel carriers often contained as few as three infantry. This may not have been a problem if the purpose of the Ground Force was to shock and awe the Ukrainians into folding, enabling the mechanisms of repression to get into Ukraine’s cities and establish control. Once the Russian military found itself in heavy fighting, however, the shortage of infantry became a serious problem. The lack of effective line infantry units caused Spetsnaz units to be deployed mostly as light infantry, which also led to a high level of casualties among these units. Far fewer Spetsnaz were therefore available for special forces missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far from drawing away from this practice, the trend during the war has been for regular tasks to be taken over by irregular forces. The initial Russian invasion plan had envisaged the deployment of Chechen units to support the FSB in establishing the counterintelligence regime on the occupied territories. Once heavy fighting erupted these units were committed as assault troops on key axes, not least Mariupol. In a bid to stem casualties – especially among Russian assault forces – great efforts were put into mobilising battalions from the populations on the occupied territories of Donbas and Luhansk, largely commanded through parts of the Eighth Combined Arms Army. Casualties among these troops were excessive, especially when they were used to conduct mass infantry assaults against Ukrainian trenches in Donbas to fix and identify Ukrainian firing posts for more capable Russian assault troops moving in behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another force that was rerolled was Wagner. The Wagner Group had a peripheral role in the initial invasion plan, largely orchestrating volunteers among Russian partners in Syria and Africa as part of an information campaign to suggest that Russia had widespread international support. Since the invasion was supposed to be quick, Wagner was not initially withdrawn from the range of commitments it held in Africa, and even expanded some of these tasks – as in Mali – during the early phase of the war. The disarray among Russian conventional forces following their setbacks in the opening weeks of the war made it immediately apparent that there would be a shortage of military specialists and assault troops. At first, this led to Wagner moving personnel from its wider deployments into Ukraine and, since then, has seen Wagner embark on massive recruitment drives, including in Russian prisons. Wagner has also spearheaded bringing skilled Russian personnel back into service – such as pilots – often with offers of significantly inflated salaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prominence of Wagner and several other private irregular armies in the Russian forces bears scrutiny because most of these organisations originated as part of Russia’s special services. The Wagner Group emerged from a battalion of irregulars supported by the GRU in Donbas in 2014. In its operations in Africa and Syria, GRU officers would routinely embed into Wagner units, using them as cover or being the link with Russian conventional capabilities to enable Wagner forces. Given the political prominence of Yevgeny Prigozhyn, it would be inaccurate to say that Wagner remains entirely subordinate to the GRU. In fact, the GRU has often routed political recommendations to Putin through Prigozhyn rather than its own official chain of command. Instead, it would be fairer to say that the GRU and Wagner are strongly intertwined. Despite transcending the GRU’s chain of command, the supply of weapons and military equipment to Wagner is carried out by the structures of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation through the 78th Special Reconnaissance Centre and the 22nd Special Forces Brigade of the GRU. Alongside Wagner are other organisations, often built around specific capabilities such as UAVs. A good example is PWC Redut, largely led by former Wagner personnel, but organised around reconnaissance, intelligence and sabotage missions, and commanded by a GRU officer previously responsible for Wagner’s intelligence operations. It is anticipated that the number of private military companies sponsored by arms of the Russian government and associated entities is likely to increase over the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significance of special forces-enabled irregular units to the Russian military is exacerbated by the state of Russian industry. The Orlan-10 UAV, for example, has proven one of the most effective pieces of equipment in the Russian Army’s arsenal for ISR. Although it was developed by the conventional force, the manufacturer receives a significant proportion of its funding from the GRU. More importantly, the export-controlled microelectronics that the manufacturer needs must be procured illicitly through the front companies established and run by Russia’s special services. Another example is the procurement of loitering munitions from Iran. The burgeoning strategic relationship with Iran was initially enabled by outreach conducted and maintained by Russia’s special services with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Given that Russian defence industry is increasingly dependent on these structures, who gets equipment in the Russian military is also partly determined by their connections with the irregular organisations. This resource allocation in turn determines who has the capabilities to own battlespace and problem sets in the field. In time, Russia’s conventional forces may reassert control. National mobilisation may reduce the dependence on irregular formations. For military specialisms, however, it is likely that the foreign currency and equipment available to these units will see their importance to the Russian war effort remain high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia’s conventional Spetsnaz have increasingly been used as assault troops, the practices of Spetsnaz controlled directly by the special services have arguably reverted to a more Soviet approach and away from the Western special forces model that Russia has attempted to develop over the past decade. This has seen the employment of Spetsnaz in more intimate collaboration with human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;human-intelligence-and-reconnaissance&quot;&gt;Human Intelligence and Reconnaissance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The failure of Russian forces to occupy the target territory left a large body of agents in place. Similarly, for Ukraine, the overrunning of its territory saw a large part of the Ukrainian population stranded in areas under Russian control. This left in place the opportunity for resistance operations. Although the mechanisms for countering the threat from within Ukraine as compared with the counterintelligence regime on the occupied territories differ, the pressures on these Russian and Ukrainian networks have led to a similar prioritisation of tasks and adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proportion of Ukraine’s population prepared to resist the invaders was and is high. Although the will to resist is a prerequisite, however, it is not sufficient in and of itself to make resistance effective. In the early days of the invasion, for example, there were organised peaceful demonstrations in several occupied towns and cities. These had no effect, and the organisers were subsequently targeted for suppression. There has been value in graffiti and other demonstrations of the continued existence of the resistance movement, but only in sustaining the movement itself, rather than in having any significant psychological effect on the enemy. The organisation of sabotage and similar direct action is possible but also largely ineffective unless coordinated across multiple areas and carried out at scale. Any such operations tend to lead to the capture or disruption of the networks involved. Direct action therefore is used sparingly for two purposes: destabilisation of the counterintelligence regime on the territory; and the synchronised disruption of Russian units ahead of conventional forces moving into an area. Indeed, in most cases, direct action has actually been carried out by the special forces of Ukraine’s special services who are assisted by the resistance movement in their ability to transit and operate in areas. As these personnel can withdraw after carrying out an action, they pose less of a risk to the unravelling of the networks in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The much more useful and persistent value of the resistance movement is for reconnaissance and intelligence gathering. If carried out using the appropriate tradecraft, this can be executed without causing networks to be routinely unravelled by the counterintelligence regime. In the early days of the conflict, human reporting enabled the targeting of Russian units with artillery. Over time, the persistent human intelligence network held together by the resistance movement has been critical to the accurate targeting of Russian command and control and logistics infrastructure using the long-range precision fires supplied by military technical assistance from Ukraine’s international partners. The details of how the resistance movement is run is clearly operationally sensitive and is not detailed here. Nevertheless, it bears emphasising that the skills for running such networks are primarily those of human intelligence handling and covert communications and that the personnel best suited to this activity are mainly drawn from the special services rather than from the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian military has resorted to a similar prioritisation of tasks among its agent network inside of Ukraine. Direct action has not constituted the primary threat from these personnel, though it does occur. Instead, the value of this network has been in assisting with the targeting of both the Ukrainian military and critical national infrastructure, including the conduct of battle damage assessments of energy infrastructure. The existing agent apparatus provides a strong foundation for running such operations and often the targeting information can be passed by commercial encrypted messengers to Russian handlers in Europe or elsewhere before it is routed into Russia. Nevertheless, maintaining this activity does place a premium on human intelligence, covert communication and tradecraft. Reflecting this prioritisation there has been a restructuring within the GRU. Having suffered several exposures in recent years, especially surrounding the personnel of Unit 29155 responsible for sabotage and assassination, this unit has apparently been transferred out of the clandestine space. At the same time, Andrei Averianov – previously commanding 29155 – was promoted and assigned three units under his command with tasks similar to those of his previous centre. Averianov and his new units are part of the structure of the 5th Department of the GRU, which is responsible for human intelligence. It is important to note that in many respects this is a return to form after several years of trying to create a more Western-style special forces capability. According to extant GRU instruction manuals, special operations are best carried out by illegal intelligence assets, which makes special operations practitioners first and foremost human intelligence officers, who are also capable of organising direct action, rather than vice versa. Historically, the relationship between Spetsnaz and military intelligence was very close, and a significant number of GRU employees began their careers in Spetsnaz. The role of human intelligence is especially important for units directly subordinated to the GRU. Thus, some officers of Unit 29155, who were exposed and can no longer be used undercover, are now involved in remote recruitment and management of agent networks on the territory of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it may be said that the Russians do not have much trouble obtaining information about targets or locations. Their capacity to collect is significant. Assembling, analysing and disseminating this information, however, is a different matter. It is understood within the Ukrainian intelligence community that the GRU has established a targeting centre for coordinating its reconnaissance across Ukraine. Reports from human agents are routed to this centre for analysis. Here analysts produce a daily overview of detections, cross referenced with GRU geospatial intelligence and other collection methods. These digests are then either sent to the relevant military district command post and thereafter downwards to the fire control headquarters of a combined arms army and then to the artillery tactical group if the target was of a tactical nature, or to the VKS, Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol or Iskandr battalions for a deliberate long-range strike. The evidence suggests that the ingestion and analysis of detections by the targeting centre would work on a 24-hour cycle. The target packs then provided to the relevant echelon would be sent with limited contextual information to determine prioritisation – and targets were often struck in the order in which target packs were received rather than in an order reflecting the characteristics or value of the target. Often the distribution of these instructions and the target’s place in the series of tasks of the unit assigned to conduct the strike would take at least 24 hours. Sometimes this was much longer, especially where it required Russian naval assets to move to a position and launch Kalibr missiles. Furthermore, some targets struck were military installations many years ago, suggesting that there is a drive for the GRU to generate targets even when it does not have current intelligence. The result has been a persistent problem for the Russians with latency between their collection and their ability to strike targets. Despite the shortcomings of Russia’s targeting cycle, the fact that they have consistently found targets and have the means to strike them means that how to identify and break up these human reconnaissance networks is a key question for the rear area security of NATO conventional forces in the event of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In studying the forms and methods of Russia’s unconventional war against Ukraine, it is worth considering the strengths of the Russian special services, their systemic weaknesses and the extent to which they will remain a major threat in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with Russian strengths, it is evident that the Russian special services managed to recruit a large agent network in Ukraine prior to the invasion and that much of the support apparatus has remained viable after the invasion, providing a steady stream of human intelligence to Russian forces. The internal threat significantly constrained the political room for manoeuvre for the Ukrainian state prior to the conflict and this produced unfavourable conditions for preparing the population for war. There has, for many years, been a bias in many states to favour collection against Russian activities on their territories. The evidence from Ukraine strongly suggests that Russian subversion should be actively resisted and disrupted before it can build up the mutually supporting structure that existed in Ukraine. The Russian tendency to corrupt targets for recruitment and to recruit under a false flag appears to be an effective means of building large networks quickly, though the reliability of individual agents is arguably much less than those recruited for ideological reasons. The tendency to rely on a small number of elite agents who run their own networks also means that moving against these individuals has a disproportionate impact on Russian capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it is important to acknowledge that the threats outlined in this report – of high-level recruitment and the build-up of a support apparatus – is not a problem limited to Ukraine. During the course of the conflict both a senior signals intelligence analyst in the BND and a senior counterintelligence officer in the BND have been uncovered as Russian agents. The same methods are used, to some effect, widely. And the consequences of failing to counter this activity are significant. In April 2022 the authors of this report highlighted the extensive discussions in the Russian special services regarding their capacity to destabilise Moldova, in order ‘for destabilisation and the broadening of the front to protect [protract] and expand the economic and political costs on the West’. The attempt to destabilise Moldova appears now to be being attempted. It is important that states are proactive in preventing Russia building up these capabilities in their countries and, where this has been achieved, actively closing down these networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another strength of the Russian unconventional warfare capabilities is their systematic methodology for repression of occupied territories. Although crude and violent – having a terrible effect on the economy and quality of life in targeted areas – it does appear to be an effective method of constraining resistance activities to a manageable level and maintaining control. The evidence from Chechnya suggests that it may take a generation for resistance to be fully quashed, but that does not mean that resistance activities threaten the Russian position. It is also important to note that the digitised tools that have proven an effective enabler of this counterintelligence apparatus are exportable to other autocracies and may be a feature of Russia’s offer to elites in states where it wishes to maintain influence. For NATO forces, the strength of the counterintelligence regime strongly suggests that partnered resistance operations need to be calibrated towards reconnaissance rather than direct action unless the territory on which the resistance network is active is likely to be imminently liberated. Those interfacing with these networks need to prioritise skills in handling human agents and in covert communications if their networks are to remain survivable. Another key lesson is that any resistance network established prior to a conflict must be invisible to the bureaucracy of the state, or else it risks exposure through the capture of a state’s records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are also clearly considerable deficiencies in Russia’s approach to unconventional warfare. At a fundamental level the Russian special services lack self-awareness, or at least the honesty to report accurately about their own efforts. In the case of Ukraine, a plan was attempted that was critically dependent on unconventional methods when the preconditions for success had not yet been achieved. This reveals wider cultural problems in the Russian services. That they are directed to bring about an outcome without independently assessing the viability of the plan creates a reporting culture where officers are encouraged to have a significant optimism bias. Furthermore, there appears to be a systemic problem of overreporting one’s successes and concealing weaknesses to superiors. This is evidenced by the overly optimistic assessment of the proportion of Russia’s agent network that would be proactive in supporting Russia in the context of a full-scale invasion. The fact that this lack of self-awareness in the Russian services contributes to blunders can certainly be exploited by counterespionage officers, but is far from comforting as it leads to a situation in which the Russians are difficult to deter because they have an unrealistic estimation of the likelihood of their success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another significant vulnerability in Russia’s approach to unconventional warfare is that it is formulaic. When under pressure, the reaction has been to revert to tried and tested forms and methods from the Soviet period rather than to innovate. Furthermore, because of the scale at which these activities are attempted, once a particular form or method is exposed it tends to have been widely replicated allowing for the rapid detection of a wide range of unconnected activities. The Russian system does not appear to encourage treating each operation as bespoke. Although this does mean that Russian operations can scale quickly against an unsuspecting target, there is also a real vulnerability to an alert target because operations risk exposing one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this tendency to revert under pressure to established forms and methods, there is considerable dynamism and entrepreneurialism among Russia’s special services. As demonstrated by Wagner or the restructuring of the GRU’s clandestine capabilities while in contact, the services are quick to seize on opportunities and have the policies and permissions to do so. This is exacerbated by the political dynamic behind their employment, which is perhaps best captured in Ian Kershaw’s phrase describing the animation of the Hitlerite state as ‘working towards the Fuhrer’. The special services are encouraged to develop operations consistent with their understanding of Putin’s intent and, depending upon which is closest to his will and is more successful, there flows resource and attention. This kind of internal competition also allows Putin to reward or punish service chiefs and officials without their ever feeling truly secure. These dynamics make the special services highly active and willing to accept risk. It also distorts analysis, encouraging exaggeration of both their prospects in reporting and a catastrophism in ascribing failure to the scale of adversary efforts. It encourages blame shifting internally, limiting accurate after-action reviews. The upshot is that, while the Russian services may have failed in Ukraine, this is unlikely to prevent their being central to the coercive activities of the Russian state in the future, and countering them will remain no less important.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Efforts should be made to build our country into a cyber power. . . . The countries that take command of the internet will win the world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s efforts to dominate and potentially weaponize next-generation technologies are now garnering considerable attention. In October 2022, the Biden administration imposed wide-ranging restrictions on China’s access to advanced chip technologies, and it is considering additional actions on quantum computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and biotechnologies. These measures come on top of broader Western efforts to constrain China’s growing dominance in telecommunications and surveillance technologies, such as those provided by Huawei, ZTE, Hikvision, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond their implications for weapons systems, these efforts reflect concerns regarding whose technologies will underlie our increasingly digital societies and what those technologies might be used for. Only recently, however, have the risks posed by China’s internet platforms — social media, e-commerce, and search applications such as TikTok, AliExpress, and WeChat — begun to be considered. Like their U.S. counterparts (such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon), Chinese platforms facilitate user interaction and offer community, connectivity, shopping, news, entertainment, search, and many other now indispensable functions for our internet-reliant digital societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With TikTok’s explosive growth in the United States, there is a surge in efforts to ban the app at local, state, and federal levels. Much of the concern has focused on the data collection and surveillance possibilities the Chinese-owned app might provide to Beijing. While those risks are real, the influence capabilities of TikTok are, surprisingly, only just gaining attention. The focus on TikTok’s influence appears overdue given what we know about the influence wielded by platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Amazon. By many measures, TikTok is both more addictive and more influential than its U.S. counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nations such as Russia, China, and Iran have understood the soft powers of platforms for some time. They have used Western platforms to influence not only U.S. and other Western elections, but also social discourse and civil society. Studies show that these efforts have had measurable impacts by shaping online and offline civic action, initiating and fanning conspiracy theories, and promoting divisions in society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth and spread of Chinese platforms globally pose additional risks. In the West, these platforms are likely to be constrained through government regulation. But in much of the rest of the world, their proliferation offers China powerful influence capabilities that could be used (and in many cases already is being used) to undermine democratic institutions and processes, sow discord, and boost China’s image and interests. Given modern societies’ reliance on internet platforms, if Chinese platforms become preeminent in numerous countries around the world, they would contribute significantly to China’s command of the internet — and with it a commensurate diminishment of U.S. business, power, and global influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;internet-platforms-are-nearly-everywhere&quot;&gt;Internet Platforms Are Nearly Everywhere&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet has become indispensable to modern life, and platforms offering social media, e-commerce, and search functions have become an indispensable, almost indistinguishable, part of the online experience. This is true throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, nearly two-thirds (5.03 billion) of all people have access to the internet. For those not yet connected, significant efforts are under way around the world to bring digital connectivity to underserved communities. The vast majority of today’s internet users also use social media (4.7 billion, or 59 percent of the global population); while global internet users grew by 4 percent in 2021, social media users grew by 10 percent, more than twice that pace. On average, internet users spend a remarkable seven hours a day online — two and a half of those on social media, or 15 percent of an individual’s waking hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just social media. More than three-quarters of internet users between the ages of 16 and 64 also report using e-commerce (buying something online) each month. E-commerce is revolutionizing retail and with it global supply chains, logistics, and payment systems. Nearly 20 percent of all retail commerce is now handled through e-commerce platforms, and that number is expected to rise to 24 percent by 2026. In dollar terms, that equates to an increase from $5.2 trillion to $8.1 trillion over four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popularity of social media and e-commerce apps, however, is surpassed only by search engine apps such as Google. In fact, the majority of internet users (63 percent) cite “search” as the primary reason they go online. It is so valuable to individuals that, according to internet scholars Erik Brynjolfsson and Avinash Collis, the median price you would have to pay an individual in the United States to forego their ability to use internet search for one year was $17,000 — and this was before the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media, e-commerce, and search are three of the key functions that are both essential to and synonymous with today’s digital world. Platforms offering these features bring not only community, connection, and services, but have themselves become part of the essential infrastructure of the internet as portals to many other services and connections: advertising, maps, news, resources, websites, and much more. Moreover, platform companies such as Amazon are now extending their capabilities beyond user experience and services to cloud computing and content delivery networks (CDNs), essential infrastructure of our connected world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;platforms-are-architected-for-influence&quot;&gt;Platforms Are Architected for Influence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As these platforms have gained power in the global economy, their ability to shape what users experience has also come to light. Independent research, whistleblowers, and government investigations have detailed disturbing powers of influence that can be exercised through these platforms. For instance, a report by Avaaz found that four times more views were generated by the 10 most popular Facebook Covid-19 misinformation sites compared to content from the 10 leading international health institutions (e.g., the WHO and CDC). Amazon favors its products over those of third-party retailers selling on its platform, and its logistics business was found to have reshaped supply chains and logistics in the United States, largely to its favor. The European Union fined Google over 8 billion euros for favoring its products and services over those of independent companies using its platform. Perhaps more disturbing, multiple studies found that social media and search platforms have been able to sway voters in the United States and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, mounting evidence shows platforms have and exert powers of influence over social discourse, beliefs, and behaviors. They can affect elections and buying habits, undermine factual accounts, stir social discord, and shift political, social, and commercial behaviors. These powers partly arise out of the role platforms increasingly play as vital internet infrastructure and gateways, as well as key elements of social, commercial, governmental, and political interaction in modern societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These influence powers also arise out of the design characteristics of the platforms themselves. Social media, search, and e-commerce platforms are, in effect, designed as “architectures of influence.” They are explicitly built to engage users and keep them engaged through a powerful mix of data on those users, stimulation of the brain chemical dopamine, and algorithms that continuously test and refine stimuli to enhance engagement. This is the “business logic” of platform technologies — through data, dopamine, and algorithms they keep users attracted and engaged. This generates advertising and transaction revenue while also amassing saleable data and helping refine algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This underlying business logic gives rise to other levers of influence in platform architecture, such as “structural attributes,” the capabilities platforms possess to purposefully shape what users are seeing and experiencing. Platforms largely use three methods: surveillance, chokeholds, and moderation. Surveillance includes the ability to monitor users’ activities, their purchases, who they friend, where they are located, what information they exchange, and the like. Because platforms control the algorithms and the user experience, they are also able to “choke off” or limit access to content (chokeholds or chokepoints). Some of these chokehold powers are desirable or even legally mandated, such as preventing access to violent videos or child pornography. But platforms can also impose their own chokeholds, restricting content they deem undesirable, such as political messaging with which they disagree. Beyond surveillance and chokeholds, platforms exercise active moderation, which entails purposeful efforts to steer users to particular content and away from other content — for example, by promoting one product over another or one kind of political messaging over another. Moderation is the ability to purposefully shape and refine what users see and experience. Thus, platforms’ structural attributes, building on their business logic, give them considerable powers of influence over their users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final layer of influence architecture, called “leveraged affordances,” refers to platforms’ operation as open spaces that enable multiple users to exchange information with each other — and, in many cases, to seek to influence other users on the platform. Today, internet influencers drive billions of dollars in product sales, ignite trends, define fashions, and much more. But other users, leveraging the capabilities platforms offer to reach a broad audience, sow conspiracy theories, promote disinformation or misinformation, and seek to steer online and offline behavior — including voting and insurrections. These often involve the use of techniques such as bots, fake users, and flooding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 summarizes platforms’ architectures of influence, highlighting their business logic, structural attributes, and leveraged affordances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These design and performance characteristics of platforms create an environment where influence can be exercised by at least five different actors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the platforms themselves,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;users of the platform,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the sovereign nation from which the platform originates,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a host nation where the platform operates (outside its sovereign territory), and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cyber intruders or hackers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These actors may contest and counterbalance each other on the platform, but it is the platform business itself that becomes the final arbiter and thus is often the most critical actor — enabling, constraining, or exerting influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinese-platforms-and-influence&quot;&gt;Chinese Platforms and Influence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese platforms were built on the same principles as those of the West. Indeed, for a few years Western platforms competed in China with Chinese platforms. However, through a combination of regulatory constraints and intense competition, by 2010 most Western platforms were forced to or chose to exit the country. Western capital, however, did not: Through a series of finance-raising efforts on international and domestic markets, Chinese platform companies such as Tencent and Alibaba raised billions of dollars to fund next-generation innovation and their own domestic and international expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, China has some of world’s leading social media, e-commerce, and search platforms, which offer immersive and deeply compelling digital ecosystems that have brought products, services, connectivity, and financial access to hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens — not to mention users abroad. In fact, Chinese platforms have been at the forefront of digital innovation, bringing into the mainstream addictive short-video formats (such as TikTok), digital payment and credit scoring systems, QR codes, influencer-driven selling, community buying programs, and much more. For a number of years, China’s digital innovation has been regarded by industry observers as well ahead of that of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s powerful and innovative platforms — with their all-encompassing user experiences, data aggregation, and algorithmic manipulations — are also critical to the country’s domestic surveillance and control systems. Numerous studies have shown that in order to grow and flourish in China’s environment, these platforms have had to make concessions to and partner with the government. Today, China’s leading platforms are essential to the nation’s increasingly authoritarian surveillance and control architecture. While a host of technology firms are involved (from facial recognition software developers to broadband providers), platform companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu — through which citizens interface with technology — all play critical and instrumental roles as partners to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in blocking unwanted content, promoting government narratives, prompting “appropriate” behaviors, and reporting on users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether by choice, design, or compulsion, Chinese platforms are active — even pro-active — partners of the CCP. As a result, they have developed and continue to develop advanced forms of exerting or enabling influence. These practices are built into their business operations, culture, and technology architecture. Arguably, as seen with TikTok, their influence capabilities are significant and, in some respects, more robust than those of competing Western platforms. Drawing from their extensive domestic experience, Chinese platforms are notably more practiced in directly exerting and facilitating influence. Said another way, their “architectures of influence” are stronger and more attuned to wielding power than those of the West. The regulatory crackdown in China has served to further enhance the power of the CCP (the “platform sovereign”) to dictate what these platforms do and how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As these platforms expand beyond China, they have brought these capabilities and predispositions with them. For example, Tencent’s WeChat has around 200 million users outside of China. The app was found to be a highly moderated platform for Chinese influence operations through news channels, influencers, and censorship. The system is so insular and attuned to China’s interests that WeChat even censored messages from Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, who was rebutting misinformation the Chinese government had spread on the app — but his messages were never received by Australia’s WeChat users. In 2022, WeChat simply disabled Morrison’s access and sold the account to a Chinese company. Australia is not the only example. WeChat took similar action in Canada, censoring a Canadian parliamentarian’s post to her Canadian WeChat followers when she expressed support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. WeChat posts by users abroad have also invited harassment of their family, friends, and business relations inside China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WeChat’s user base may be influential, but outside China it is arguably small. However, its parent company, Tencent, is the largest gaming company in the world. Therefore, when Tencent censors live chats between its gamers — as it has been doing since at least 2018, blanking out words like Taiwan, Uyghur, Tibet, and other sensitive topics — this arguably has a significant impact across its 1.4 billion users globally. More striking is that Tencent has openly sanctioned gamers outside China who raise issues such as the Hong Kong protests. After Ng “Blitzchung” Wai Chung supported the Hong Kong protests during an official tournament, Hearthstone publisher Activision Blizzard (partially owned at that time by Tencent) “issued steep sanctions on the player,” and Tencent-owned Riot Games followed suit by “warning broadcasters and players to stay away from any ‘sensitive topics’ during 2019’s League of Legends World Championship. This included the Hong Kong protests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tencent’s companies are not alone in these efforts. ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, was found to be censoring negative news about China on another one of its apps, BaBe, in its Indonesian operations. TikTok itself had “moderation” guidelines that prohibited topics that China considers sensitive (such as Xinjiang, Tibet, and Tiananmen). These actions are not limited to social media platforms, however. China’s leading e-commerce firm, Alibaba, suspended its most popular Russian-language influencer, a Ukrainian, when he posted accounts of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that differed from the Russian — and Chinese — narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese platforms are clearly powerful influence engines, and they have been harnessed in support of CCP interests both inside and outside China. But are these platforms truly competitors of U.S. platforms on the global stage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinese-platforms-international-expansion&quot;&gt;Chinese Platforms’ International Expansion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese platforms have been expanding outside China since the early 2010s. This is especially so in emerging markets, where they have natural advantages stemming from their “mobile first” designs, integration of e-payments, and integration with the internet technology infrastructure (“tech stack”) that China is building through its Digital Silk Road (DSR). The DSR is the technology component of the country’s signature foreign-policy Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It seeks to expand markets for Chinese technology companies while building commercial, social, and people-to-people connectivity between recipient countries and China. The DSR offers countries easy financing, government support, and encouragement for Chinese technology companies expanding overseas, particularly in emerging economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese platform expansion has also been driven by strong commercial interests, competition, and abundant capital reserves. Along with far-reaching Chinese government support and encouragement, these companies have primarily used four methods to expand globally:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Service extensions: This involves the expansion of service offerings within a country (adding e-commerce to a social media platform, for example) or extending services to countries previously not served.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expanding technology infrastructure: This includes building data centers, content delivery networks, and cloud services in a country. In so doing, platforms are not only enabling or expanding their own service offerings, but more closely linking their operations to the tech stack often being built (and maintained) by other Chinese companies. This interoperability within the tech stack may serve Chinese interests if and when there is a decoupling between Western and Chinese digital technologies and ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engaging in venture capital: Venture capital (VC) investments have proliferated not only in China, but in many countries around the world. Some of this is through branded corporate venture capital (CVC), but much of this investment takes place through venture capital firms not visibly associated with the platforms. Investing through other VC firms enables the platforms to diffuse equity risks while capturing insights into innovative or disruptive technologies they could then acquire more directly. These investments also allow the platforms access to technologies and companies without direct brand identification. Thus, wherever there is significant VC activity, it is probable that the platform firms are present in branded and/or unbranded form.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minority and majority share acquisitions: Chinese platforms have been prolific investors and acquirers around the world. As of November 2022, for example, Tencent had made more than 1,100 acquisitions or investments globally, Alibaba more than 260, and Bytedance over 50.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet despite this near frenetic activity, as of 2022, few Chinese platforms could be considered “preeminent” in countries outside of China, meaning they do not comprise a significant majority of users in a given country. Western platforms (and some local or regional ones) dominate search, social media, and e-commerce. Unseating incumbent platforms is difficult due to strong network effects and high switching costs for users. Chinese platform companies have not fared as well as their Western counterparts in terms of common measures of platform leadership such as stock value, market share, and net revenue. Moreover, Chinese platforms face various additional challenges, not least among them the recent tech crackdown in China — a “rectification” that was officially completed in January 2023 — which forced many of these firms to restructure and redirect their investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of these challenges, however, Chinese platforms retain several advantages that — at least in emerging economies — may enhance their ability to eclipse Western platforms. These include their continued investments in and adoption of market-leading innovations (investments that are actually increasing), their integration with the Chinese tech stack in many countries (see Figure 5), and China’s efforts to rewrite internet governance and technology standards globally. Legal scholars Matthew Erie and Thomas Streinz refer to a “Beijing effect” in emerging economies, wherein the attractiveness of China’s vision of “digital sovereignty,” its construction and maintenance of countries’ internet architecture, and its efforts to reshape global technology standards will pull these countries ineluctably into adopting its version of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KA4U2zW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Chinese Successes at Every Level of the Tech Stack.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aspi.org.au/report/mapping-chinas-tech-giants-supply-chains-and-global-data-collection-ecosystem&quot;&gt;Samantha Hoffman and Nathan Attrill, Mapping China’s Tech Giants: Supply chains &amp;amp; the global data collection ecosystem, (Canberra: ASPI, June 2021)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are indeed signs that Chinese platforms are already gaining ground. The explosive emergence and global adoption of Bytedance’s TikTok app is one. With more than 3 billion downloads, it is now on par with or exceeds Facebook downloads, though not yet Facebook’s users. Tencent’s global leadership in gaming gives it an advantage in the development and creation of the next-generation internet (the metaverse), backed by local and national government agencies in China. Alibaba’s global gross merchandise value (the total value of goods and services sold on its platforms) is more than twice that of Amazon. These and other indicators point to potential disruption of U.S. leadership in these key infrastructural elements of today’s digital societies — at least in emerging economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;china-and-emerging-markets&quot;&gt;China and Emerging Markets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging market nations are of vital interest to the United States. They represent almost 80 percent of the world’s people, and by 2050 will host six out of the seven largest economies in the world. The seven largest emerging market economies (E7) will constitute 50 percent of global GDP by 2050, compared with just 30 percent for the G7. The United States and the West rely on many of these nations for more than trade and investment, however important that is to their own economic livelihood. Within international institutions such as the United Nations, these countries have a majority. For example, they hold 130 of the 193 UN seats; these countries will have an increasing voice at the United Nations on issues ranging from human rights to technology standards and security standards. Even more fundamentally, the United States (and the West more broadly) relies on many of these nations for security. For instance, there are around 750 U.S. military bases across nearly 80 countries, many in emerging economies. The Biden administration’s National Security Strategy makes clear the importance of these nations to the United States and to the current system of international institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic influence among these countries has been growing for years. In 2001, 80 percent of nations worldwide had a greater volume of trade with the United States than with China. By 2018, the situation had largely reversed, with 70 percent of nations having a larger volume of trade with China than the United States. Much of China’s expanded trade activity was welcomed in the West — and by the world at large — as a contribution to economic growth and prosperity and as a measure of China’s growing integration with the U.S.-led world order. That thinking has shifted over the past decade, especially since the Covid-19 pandemic. Today, the concern is with countries’ overreliance on China for critical factors in global supply chains, with its efforts to further its military capabilities through advanced technologies, and with its intentions to displace the United States as the leading global power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s investments in the BRI and DSR, the expansion of Chinese technology firms, and China’s efforts to influence global standards setting are just some of the ways it is seeking to create a more China-centric world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese platforms have significant powers of influence, they have used these powers in support of CCP messaging and interests, and they are expanding globally. While Western platforms are creative and nimble, there is a strong chance that China’s innovative and immersive platforms — boosted by the country’s broader digital expansion and its alternative vision of the internet — will become preeminent in numerous emerging economies around the world. Given these platforms’ record of promoting CCP messaging and content, there is a clear risk that U.S./Western business, power, and influence would be impacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What might that look like? Platform influence could shape what consumers buy; how supply chains do (or do not) operate; election outcomes; public sentiment on domestic and international issues; and a nation’s political, economic, and technological dependence on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a social media standpoint, preeminent Chinese platforms would be able to favor and promote messaging preferential to Beijing’s interests — potentially swaying everything from opinions to elections to social harmony. During the Covid-19 crisis, China spread disinformation that the virus originated from a military lab in the United States and then encouraged vaccine hesitancy around the world. When Russia invaded Ukraine, China promoted the view that it was an unprovoked war and that the United States and NATO had forced Russia into a “limited military engagement.” There is a long list of Chinese propaganda and disinformation efforts. Although the presence of alternative news sources currently allows some fact-checking and rebuttal, what will happen when alternative news sources and messaging are significantly diminished?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In e-commerce, slight algorithmic changes can also shift buying behavior and realign supply chains. What happens when the market for products and services favors Chinese providers over Western ones? Furthermore, to the extent companies in these nations rely on China’s internet infrastructure (some of it managed by Chinese platform firms), is it possible to slow order fulfillment from one source and accelerate it from another? When linked with China’s dominant LOGINK logistics platform, could customs clearances and port processing be affected as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In search functions, what might happen when access to a broad range of information sources is curtailed? Manipulation of search results has been shown to affect voter preferences, consumer behavior, and social discord. What about linkages to satellite mapping as China rolls out Beidou, its alternative to the Global Positioning System (GPS), and this becomes the default map software for apps? How might traffic flows, shopping, and investment be adjusted to favor one group over another?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the geopolitical level, these changes could have significant impact on Western businesses, as well as on support for the United States and the West among a nation’s population — and therefore from its government. Wavering support could undermine Western representation and interests in global bodies such as the United Nations, in standards-setting organizations, and even political and military alignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, these are extreme scenarios — but not implausible, given what we already know about platform powers and influence. There is a long tradition of weaponizing industry in geopolitics and geoeconomics, but the understanding of platform powers is just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;platforms-and-geopolitics&quot;&gt;Platforms and Geopolitics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political scientist Susan Strange set out the concept of “structural power” as a defining force in geopolitics and geoeconomics that “confers the power to decide how things shall be done, the power to shape frameworks within which states relate to each other, relate to people, or relate to corporate enterprises. The relative power of each party in a relationship is more, or less, if one party is also determining the surrounding structure of the relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strange outlines four sources of structural power: “control over security; control over production; control over credit; and control over knowledge, beliefs and ideas.” Social media platforms have demonstrated significant powers of control over knowledge, beliefs, and ideas. Digital payment systems, enabled by platforms, have exerted significant control over credit. E-commerce platforms often exert control over production (and distribution) of goods and services. To the extent security systems are linked to platforms, such as in Xinjiang and in the “safe city” installations China has supported around the world, platforms have a degree of control over security as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-policy-response&quot;&gt;U.S. Policy Response&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has several advantages and disadvantages in this contest over global structural power. Its strengths largely arise from U.S. values shared by many people around the world, including free speech, human rights, democracy, the rule of law, and rewarding innovation. It will need to leverage these strengths to sustain a digital world open to a variety of voices and business enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has several disadvantages as well. These include a growing perception that it is behind the times in addressing its own platforms’ local and global powers. Both Europe and China appear to be well ahead of the United States — and in line with popular opinion — in curtailing platforms’ privacy intrusions and algorithmic manipulation. While in China the government has retained the right to access this data and oversee algorithms, consistent with its overall surveillance and control infrastructure, the message it is sending around the world is that it offers a safer version of the internet than the United States can offer. This perception has been compounded by the absence of a strong U.S. role in internet governance and standards-setting organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the United States is largely unable to provide internet tech stack technologies and services at competitive prices equivalent to those offered by the Chinese. China often bundles its technologies into integrated packages that are difficult to compete against. Therefore, even if an emerging economy prefers U.S. technology, from a cost and performance standpoint it is likely to choose Chinese products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, in certain respects U.S. platform technologies are racing to keep up with Chinese digital innovations such as TikTok’s algorithms. Even Facebook’s efforts to build the metaverse may be surpassed by China’s. In the fast-moving world of digital innovation, and with China redirecting investment away from consumer applications toward industrial applications, Chinese innovation may slow. But, so far, that looks unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building from its strengths, the United States is nevertheless capable of shaping this contest and bolstering an open and inclusive internet. It should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Retake a leadership role with respect to data governance and privacy. The United States should lead in passing legislation that protects both human rights and the innovation economy for which it is famous, including laws regarding personal privacy and algorithmic transparency. This is admittedly challenging but will be essential to the legitimacy of U.S. platforms and technologies going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lead in international standards-setting institutions across the technology spectrum. Among these are the International Standards Organization (ISO), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers (IEEE), and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF). Open, transparent standards setting needs to become a priority for the United States. Ensuring U.S. voices and technologies are effectively represented at these standards-setting bodies will help prevent China from defining tomorrow’s technology standards in its sole interest. In addition, the United States should lead in issues of internet governance, making clear the benefits of an open and free internet compared to the closed and authoritarian “digital sovereignty” model China is promoting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase transparency with respect to both U.S. and Chinese platform influence. While there is growing attention to U.S. platform influence, there has been much less research and much less publicity on Chinese platform influence. The United States, international institutions, NGOs, and others need to devote at least as much focus to Chinese digital influence efforts around the world. This is not to shift attention away from the important work of bringing transparency to all platform influences but to ensure that consumers and users around the world understand the implications of Chinese platforms as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Play to U.S. comparative advantages. If U.S. and Western firms cannot compete with the performance and price points of Chinese technology, they have at least two options. First, the United States can provide technical assistance to emerging market countries negotiating contracts with Chinese firms. Such past U.S. efforts have already reduced costs, improved transparency, and provided for greater social and environmental benefits for certain BRI projects. Second, the United States can work with U.S. and Western technology companies to determine if price-competitive alternatives to Chinese technologies could be produced in third countries such as India, Vietnam, or others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invest in continued U.S. innovative leadership. The United States still has the most innovative economy in the world, as demonstrated by the impact of ChatGPT and the recent breakthrough in nuclear fusion. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act of 2022 (CHIPS Act), while a form of industrial planning, also aims to stimulate innovations in various new areas. Greater consideration should be given to U.S. tech industry partnerships with U.S. civilian and military institutions. This is how the internet was founded, and it is useful to keep in mind as competition increases to control the “structural powers” of the twenty-first-century world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The influence powers of internet platforms are now becoming much better understood. As new AI innovations are introduced, the ability of these platforms to shape what users see, believe, and act on will only increase. Chinese platforms are highly innovative and powerful influence engines that are also subject to the CCP’s interests. On their own, there is a strong chance they will rise to preeminence in numerous countries around the world. In combination with China’s build-out of internet infrastructure, its efforts to control standards-setting for internet governance and technologies, and the increasing possibility of decoupling between Western and Chinese technospheres, Chinese platforms stand an even stronger chance of prevailing. If they do, we can expect a shift in structural power from the West to the East, potentially helping realize Xi Jinping’s prediction that “the countries that take command of the internet will win the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;趙家賢原定今作供 惟因法官陳仲衡身體不適押後&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BMGOmBz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（28日）踏入審訊第33天。首名控方證人區諾軒昨作供完畢，另一名控方證人趙家賢昨午到庭閱讀數千頁文件，原定今早正式出庭作供。惟今早開庭後，僅法官陳慶偉獨自進庭，表示因法官陳仲衡今天身體不適（unwell），法庭會在今午4時半前通知各方續審的日子和時間，又表示「我對延誤非常抱歉（I am so sorry for the delay）」。聆訊不足一分鐘結束。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;各被告得悉今天審訊無法繼續均反應驚訝，有被告大聲說「哦」，何桂藍、余慧明等面露愕然，在延伸庭的吳敏兒向旁聽席「O嘴」，岑敖暉則露出無奈笑容，黃之鋒亦笑着與其他被告討論。各被告隨後返回囚室，各律師代表同樣面露驚訝，有人說「tragic」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉上周三（22日）起亦身體抱恙，戴上口罩，說話聲線較微弱，至昨天仍有配戴口罩。此外，李予信在本月1日因打泰拳受傷留院，法官認為不能在被告缺席下繼續審訊，決定押後，法官陳仲衡當時提醒獲准保釋的被告不要參與任何危險的運動，陳慶偉指「試想想這裡一天需要多少法律開支」，李運騰亦補充，不僅是律師，外面也有警察駐守，「我們說的是每天數百萬元」，相關做法似乎並不負責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">趙家賢原定今作供 惟因法官陳仲衡身體不適押後</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第卅二日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-27-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-32.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第卅二日】" /><published>2023-03-27T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-03-27T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-32</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-27-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-32.html">&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;控方指前觀塘區議會主席為共謀者 區諾軒完成作供&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/D3RU1va.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（27日）踏入審訊第32天。出庭第24日的區諾軒今作供完畢，控方庭上展示區受時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻所託，向組織者群組轉告有關九東會議的訊息，控方在法官詢問下確認視蔡澤鴻為本案「共謀者」之一，因他出席了多次協調會議，可推論對謀劃知情，多名被告面露驚訝。區其後指區議會主席角色有限，「唔希望人哋收個訊息畀我都有問題，令到好多人有不必要嘅擔心。」法官亦形容一眾組織者退出初選計劃，有如司機駕駛中途突然「跳車」，區指他即使「跳車」仍有留意事態發展，亦承認退出後因「有啲手尾要處理」曾出席港島區會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區作供完畢後，法官陳仲衡提醒區勿與將作供的還柙被告討論案情，區答「法官閣下，就我理解我唔會接觸到，亦都唔會接觸佢哋」，法官陳慶偉補充建議勿接觸任何受審被告，區表示明白，散庭時多人向今天67歲生日的梁國雄賀生日快樂。此外，另一控方證人、同案被告趙家賢下午獲安排到庭閱讀數千頁文件，他身穿黑色風衣、深藍長褲，套上人工耳、頸繫上口罩，於約2小時內讀畢文件，預計明早會宣誓作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指議員否決財案有很多原因如不滿財案或政府施政-若政府無回應五大訴求亦可能反對&quot;&gt;區指議員否決財案有很多原因如不滿財案或政府施政 若政府無回應五大訴求亦可能反對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今先接受代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀補問，其後進入控方覆問。區諾軒曾於盤問表示，「會」運用否決權有三個可能，包括「我淨係話我會否決財預算案」、「我會否決財政預算案係為咗爭取五大訴求」及「我乜都唔理，總之我點都係否決財政預算案㗎啦」。區今在覆問解釋，第三點指「無論財政預算案係乜嘢內容，都會投票反對」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rWFlY9A.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 彭卓棋&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問第一和第三點的分別，區曾解釋就第一點，否決預算案「可以有好多原因，重點係你為咗乜」，區今解釋，立會議員可能不滿意財政預算案內容、對政府施政不滿、或對某一項開支有質疑而否決預算案，故要視乎當事人「究竟係抱持乜嘢理由去否決」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第二點，區同意若預算案與五大訴求有關，如撥款成立獨立調查委員會，議員會審視預算案內容才決定是否否決；而若預算案內無五大訴求的內容，政府又無就五大訴求作回應，便會「推論」該名議員會投反對票。惟法官陳慶偉糾正應是「期望」而非「推論」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官稱退出初選如司機在駕駛中途跳車-區指跳車後亦有留意事態發展&quot;&gt;官稱退出初選如司機在駕駛中途跳車 區指跳車後亦有留意事態發展&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就區諾軒早前表示組織者曾在 Facebook 公開宣布「35+」計劃暫緩，周天行問，曾否作出將計劃撤回或暫緩的決定？區重申當時中聯辦和港澳辦發聲明譴責後，「我認為初選嘅計劃必須終止」，遂去戴耀廷港大辦公室稱要終止計劃及他會退出，望戴認同，戴則指「要一啲時間諗一諗」。區其後聯絡趙家賢談及相同說話，趙指若區退出，他也會退出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區其後在7月15日早上宣布退出，並向趙及戴提及，二人隨後都相繼在 Facebook 發文分別宣布退出初選和休息。周天行問及，有沒有宣布「35+計劃」停止？陳慶偉補充是指官方聲明。區指「只能夠睇呢三個 post、三個帖文，就冇再有進一步嘅聲明或者資訊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，故情況有如當一輛車在行駛，司機突然跳車？吳政亨、柯耀林、陳志全等多人發笑。區指因為「件事都係行進緊」，亦不知道立法會選舉會是什麼情況，笑言「我會話即使啲司機跳咗車都好，至少我，都有謹慎留意事態發展」，何啟明和陳志全等發笑，林卓廷則面露驚訝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指即使退出不同政團參與者仍會參選不知道三投三不投是否也停止&quot;&gt;區指即使退出不同政團參與者仍會參選、不知道「三投三不投」是否也停止&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再問，但車輛仍在前進？區指因為「時間過得真係好快」，重申到報名時有留意情況，包括大約有誰報名，但沒特別留意有沒有初選勝出者沒報名，而最後選舉亦延期。區又指，「有樣嘢我哋係難做嘅」，就是即使組織者相繼退出，但不同參與者也是不同政團的人士，「佢哋始終都係會參與立法會選舉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行一度再問，區指組織者退出是指哪個組織者，惟陳慶偉即不耐煩指「我們知道，我們不是那麼蠢」。陳續問，區是否知道「三投三不投」計劃也停止，區指不知道，同意只知道該計劃何時開始，但不知何時終結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指民主黨立場是一直同意否決預算案-官質疑胡志偉曾表示保留&quot;&gt;控方指民主黨立場是一直同意否決預算案 官質疑胡志偉曾表示保留&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒作供亦曾提及，曾與時任民主黨主席胡志偉見面，胡表示不希望簽官方協議，又指民主黨「冇理由政府話起學校、起醫院都要否決」。區在覆問下，指與胡見面是6月中「墨落無悔」聲明書發布後，法官李運騰問控方用意，周天行解釋想澄清時序。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官其後請區諾軒避席，問控方想帶出什麼，周指想說明民主黨一直同意否決預算案，而其立場沒有改變。陳慶偉質疑胡曾在見面時提及對否決預算案有保留，即不會無差別否決，如何能說民主黨立場一致，惟周指胡在論壇上曾提及參與協調會議以來，民主黨在否決預算案立場一致。李運騰再問為何需要知道會議的確實日期，周解釋因區在6月14日，曾在組織者群組提及民主黨會否決預算案，只是不會簽官方聲明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指蔡澤鴻是共謀者曾出席多次會議故知情-區指區議會主席角色有限不望引起擔心&quot;&gt;控方指蔡澤鴻是共謀者、曾出席多次會議故知情 區指區議會主席角色有限不望引起擔心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒其後再入庭，在陳慶偉詢問下同意根據與胡志偉的會面，民主黨對綑綁否決預算案的立場有保留。控方其後展示上述6月14日的訊息，區諾軒當時表示九龍東當晚開協調會議，時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻託他向大會報告5點，包括九東認為要發布公開協議，及民主黨立場是願意簽官方聲明；蔡又指望大會接納，否則「怕兵變」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰表示，該5點明顯是蔡澤鴻向區覆述的說話，問控方是否想指控蔡是其中一名共謀者（co-conspirator）？但他的名字並沒有在公訴書（indictment）上出現，即非本案被告。周天行表示，公訴書有提及與「其他人」串謀。李追問「其他人」是否包括蔡？周一度呆住，控方團隊向他耳語，周沉默數秒再答「是」，確認指蔡是共謀者。李追問有何基礎，周指因蔡出席了多次會議，根據證據可推論他對謀劃知情。彭卓棋、鄭達鴻、余慧明等多名被告一臉驚訝，被告欄亦傳來「吓？」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區其後確認，在6月14日發訊息前與胡志偉會面，並表示雖然胡有簽署九東共同綱領，但他到了選舉論壇亦有表示贊成政府建學校和醫院。區亦雙手合十，當時只是從蔡澤鴻收到上述訊息，正如他之前所述，「區議會主席角色有限，只係見證人，我唔希望人哋收個訊息畀我都有問題，咁就會令到好多人有不必要嘅擔心。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒宣布退出後仍出席717港島會議-解釋有啲手尾要處理&quot;&gt;區諾軒宣布退出後仍出席7.17港島會議 解釋「有啲手尾要處理」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就楊雪盈初選落敗仍違共識參選，區曾指港島候選人沒有透露誰是替補人選，惟確認楊並非任何人的替補人選。周天行欲問區是如何得知，惟李運騰指區已給出肯定的答案，陳慶偉亦指問題無關。周再問，楊最終報名立法會選舉，是否出於「Plan B」的安排？陳慶偉指計劃已經停止，惟周指戴耀廷當時雖表示要休息，但提及仍有工作未完成，故謀劃當時並未停止。李運騰指那應留待陳詞，陳慶偉亦指控方應在主問時便一早問及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後展示港島區的 WhatsApp 群組紀錄，李運騰關注7月17日有會議，問區有否出席，區確認。李問區為何在7月15日宣布退出後仍出席，區解釋當時港島「仲有啲手尾要處理」，尚未談好派4隊抑或5隊出選。李追問，故區即使公開宣布退出計劃，仍沒有完全退出？區答「喺嗰一刻係，但係之後我都冇再參與喇」，李再追問，即區宣布退出，但事實上沒退出？區重申「原本因為我係處理香港島嘅協調會議，咁我覺得係有啲手尾我要處理埋佢嘅」，但表示結果是「唔成功」。區亦不記得當天有沒有向與會者提及已退出計劃，但相信大家當時都知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方展示港島區whatsapp-徐子見曾提補底計劃楊提及會與徐報名參選&quot;&gt;控方展示港島區WhatsApp 徐子見曾提補底計劃、楊提及會與徐報名參選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續展示紀錄，指梁晃維、許智峯、鄭達鴻在準備「Plan B」，惟李運騰質疑在盤問無提及，又指控方即使在覆問，可發問的事宜亦有限。紀錄續顯示，徐子見在7月31日提及政府大規模DQ候選人，由於不肯定「Plan B」會否也被DQ，故前一日的會議談及要有「補底計劃」。周問港島區7月30日有否舉行會議，區指「佢哋最後係舉行得唔成功嘅」，亦指他沒有出席當天的會議，陳慶偉再問31日是不沒有會議？區指根據訊息「佢哋最後係開唔到會㗎」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;紀錄顯示，楊雪盈其後提及她會與徐子見一起報名參選，周天行問在此背景下，楊報名參選還是否違反共識？惟李運騰質疑區也只是根據 WhatsApp 回答，但最終是法庭而非證人作出推論，陳慶偉不准控方發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒完成盤問-稱不會亦不能接觸同案證人&quot;&gt;區諾軒完成盤問 稱不會亦不能接觸同案證人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後表示已完成覆問，區諾軒完成作供。他起身向旁聽席注視和點頭，離開前法官陳仲衡提醒，尚有還柙被告要作供，着區勿與其他證人討論案情，區答「法官閣下，就我理解我唔會接觸到，亦都唔會接觸佢哋」。法官陳慶偉補充不只是將作證的被告，亦建議區不要接觸任何受審被告，區答「明白，法官閣下」，離開前再向律師席方向點頭，隨兩名懲教人員離開。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;長毛今67歲生日-多名旁聽人士祝生日快樂&quot;&gt;長毛今67歲生日 多名旁聽人士祝「生日快樂」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪其後表示，下午趙家賢會在庭上閱讀文件，並對趙家賢在宣誓前閱讀沒有意見。代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉關注部分文件的呈堂性，指有文件並非從趙家賢、而是從民主動力職員黎敬輝擷取，惟控方曾表明不傳召黎。李運騰指文件呈堂性和證人是否可在庭上閱讀文件是兩回事，指辯方屆時可提出和就此盤問，而證人獲准閱讀文件亦不代表文件獲准呈堂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉遂下令休庭讓趙閱讀文件。散庭時，社民連陳寶瑩、陳皓桓和一名女童上前，向今天67歲生日的梁國雄高喊：「毛哥生日快樂」、「毛伯伯生日快樂！」，梁國雄亦揮手回應。今早入庭時黃浩銘、陳寶瑩等亦有賀梁國雄生日快樂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢下午於庭內閱畢數千頁文件&quot;&gt;趙家賢下午於庭內閱畢數千頁文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢下午獲安排在庭上閱讀文件，法官並不在場。記者於下午約2時40分獲准進入法庭，身穿黑色風衣、深藍長褲，套上人工耳、頸繫上口罩的趙家賢已坐在證人台，以手提電腦閱讀文件，被3名懲教看守。庭上有約10名旁聽人士及數名記者，沒有被告到場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢讀文件期間默不作聲，僅有一次向法庭職員確認進度。他於下午4時34分示意已完成閱讀文件，隨3名懲教沿被告欄步入囚室，離開時一度以右手揉大腿。案件明早續審，預料將傳召趙家賢作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方大狀未戴好假髮-官一度稱若不喜歡就扔進垃圾桶任事務律師&quot;&gt;辯方大狀未戴好假髮 官一度稱若不喜歡就扔進垃圾桶任事務律師&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方覆問時，法官陳慶偉一度打斷，要求其中一名辯方大律師戴好假髮，又指留意到不少新大狀在庭上從不留意他們的衣着。李運騰和陳仲衡均指，戴假髮應遮蓋前額的頭髮，陳慶偉並指，若該名大狀不喜歡假髮，可以將之扔進垃圾桶並轉任事務律師（“If you don’t like the wig, chuck it in the bin and become a solicitor.”）臨散庭前，陳仲衡再次提醒該名大律師戴好假髮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;港島會議改一人投一票-惟協議最終版本仍顯示一人投四票&quot;&gt;港島會議改一人投一票 惟協議最終版本仍顯示一人投四票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就彭卓棋代表大狀盧敏儀今早就控方新呈文件的補問，區確認港島區原本協議一人投4票，惟因投票程式技術問題，至5月19日的第三次協調會議「無奈接受」改為一人投一票。盧敏儀展示控方新擷取，由戴耀廷於6月8日發出的港島區協議「final」檔案「35+立會過半計劃 民主派港島區協調機制協議」，當中提及「以全票制選出他支持的四張名單」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀問，上述內容是否不反映第三次會議達成的共識，戴耀廷不知為何搞錯了。區同意，並確認6月9日記者會上他及戴均提及港島是一人投一票。盧續指，與會者被通知要改為投一票，但文件卻寫投4票，他們會非常疑惑和困惑，惟法官李運騰打斷指區不能代他人回答，改問區收到文件時有否發現與會上共識不同，區答「我唔知道，冇留意到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡提及文件第3點，指有意參與協調者可在5月中表明查詢，指文件似乎於5月前準備。區指不肯定，因文件不斷更新，但若核對初稿也無變化便可說於5月中前準備。盧續問，戴耀廷是否從沒提及有人對該點有疑問？區指戴「冇特別講」，並指二人均有出席第三次會議，理論上二人對港島一直想投4票的認知是相近，區本人也沒收到相關提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;協議稱名單不多於3人-惟彭卓棋名單有4人-辯方指彭故意不遵從共識&quot;&gt;協議稱名單不多於3人 惟彭卓棋名單有4人 辯方指彭故意不遵從共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀其後同時展示初稿和最終版本港島協議，均提及「選民參與的系統會以名單形式，不多於3名參選人」，區確認此條款為港島獨有。盧提及在首次港島會議，有女與會者關注她只是獨自參選，若候選人可將多人加入名單便可吸引更多選民投票，對她不公平，故與會者同意一張名單內不能多於3人。區指不記得誰提出，但記得有相關討論，而且一定是頭兩次會議內處理，亦沒有人反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧其後展示彭卓棋的提名表格，顯示其名單有4人，除他以外，還有何致宏、張嘉莉和李永財。盧遂問區是否同意，彭從初選一開始，已故意地（deliberately）不遵從共識？惟法官質疑區諾軒無法回答彭是否「故意」，區亦表示「我冇辦法知道」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰遂問盧，其案情是否彭卓棋「故意」不遵從共識，盧指案情是彭沒有遵從，惟陳仲衡指盧提及「故意」一詞，是問題的關鍵，又指若她無此意，問這樣的問題是很危險，盧最後同意這是其案情。區最後在法官詢問下，表示知道彭名單有4人，但「我哋唔為意呢個係一個問題」，當時亦沒有任何行動，並解釋初選出線只會計算頭四名的名單，而非個人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">控方指前觀塘區議會主席為共謀者 區諾軒完成作供</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第卅一日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-24-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-31.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第卅一日】" /><published>2023-03-24T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-03-24T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-31</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-24-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-31.html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第31天。區諾軒繼續接受盤問，重申初選文件無提戴耀廷「攬炒十步」亦無要求參加者支持「攬炒」，而他認同否決預算案致特首下台造成「憲制危機」，但不想將「攬炒」與《基本法》中否決財案致解散立法會的機制「混為一談」，強調當時真誠地認為戴耀廷想法「同我哋成班人搞初選無干」。戴曾形容立會過半否決權是「大殺傷力憲制武器」，法官陳慶偉一度指「大殺傷力武器」概念最早於20多年前出現，美國以此為由入侵伊拉克和推翻其政府，惟區稱沒想到該歷史背景，認為該說法只是戴對使用憲制權力的論述框架和包裝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦展示提名表格，法官陳仲衡關注參選人須聲明無因相關法例喪失參選或當選資格。區指知道有參選人曾被DQ，但他作為初選舉辦者「都可以叫係『打開門口做生意』」。陳仲衡一度質疑條款是否「window dressing measure（整色整水）」，區同意是採用「誠實制度」，又認為民主要素包括參選和被選權，「我哋冇諗過去DQ曾經被政府DQ嘅人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區重申初選文件無攬炒十步無要求參加者支持攬炒&quot;&gt;區重申初選文件無「攬炒十步」、無要求參加者支持「攬炒」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒繼續接受代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑盤問。陳世傑就「攬炒」發問，區同意，認為戴耀廷的「攬炒」概念整體而言是瘋狂。陳問「攬炒」是否與「35+」無關？區指雖然「攬炒」是戴的個人立場，但文章內容的確提及到初選的情況。此時法官陳慶偉表示，不太能理解辯方問題，指若無法達成「35+」，攬炒很大程度是幻想；李運騰亦指，本案控罪不是「35+」，而是「串謀顛覆」，而法庭不是要裁定被告是否「35+」參與者，而是有否同意顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑澄清問題，指「攬炒」的概念並非「35+計劃」的協議，區答：「我講過好多次，喺所有嘅初選文件入面，都冇話參加者要支持攬炒，或者有攬炒十部曲嘅內容喺入面。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指攬炒為攬住一齊死你燒我我燒你&quot;&gt;官指攬炒為「攬住一齊死」、「你燒我我燒你」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒曾在初選翌日出席電台節目，表示戴耀廷攬炒文章應與初選分開審視，陳世傑續問區認為「攬炒」的概念是否應與「35+計劃」分開審視？主控周天行指概念空泛（generic），望辯方澄清，陳慶偉亦問陳是要談及全部「攬炒十步」抑或其中一步，陳回應是「攬炒」的廣泛概念，視乎區諾軒如何定義，基本上即是「你做了傷害我的事，我就拖你落水（drag you down）」。陳慶偉則以中文指出，可以是「攬住一齊死」或「你燒我我燒你」，但認為大家都知道概念的廣義意思，沒有需要問證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑重申想問以區對「攬炒」的理解，是否認為應與「35+計劃」分開，陳慶偉則指區已多次提及，答案視乎背景，並非簡單的「yes」或「no」，而「攬炒」在不同時期有不同定義。李運騰亦指在戴耀廷發文前，「攬炒」只有一個相對有限的意思，但當戴發表〈真攬炒十步〉一文後，便有很不同的意思，成了一個過程（process）、一個更嚴重的問題（much serious matter）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區不想將攬炒與基本法解散立法會機制混為一談真誠認為戴看法與初選無干&quot;&gt;區不想將「攬炒」與《基本法》解散立法會機制混為一談、真誠認為戴看法與初選無干&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續問，若「35+」成功後否決兩次預算案致立法會解散，會否認為屬「攬炒」？區答：「我真係唔想將攬炒同埋呢個《基本法》嘅機制混為一談，呢篇文章係戴耀廷……」惟陳慶偉打斷指問題無關戴的文章。區續答：「我真係冇諗過呢個問題，我只係會話呢一個係造成咗香港一個好唔理想嘅後果。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再問，區會否認為兩次否決預算案致特首下台是造成「憲制危機」？區同意，李再問會否因此認為是廣義的「攬炒」？區搖頭道：「我唔想將呢個情況再引申去『攬炒』」，因為攬炒「人言人殊」，而且戴耀廷的「攬炒」是一個根據很多假設的沙盤推演，「我好想將呢一啲咁嘅概念區分開嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，區在電台節目上要求分開審視，實際上是想公眾知道些什麼？區解釋當時表達該看法，一來因為當時《國安法》已立法，「法律風險真係好高」；二來「我當時真誠地認為，呢一篇文章係戴耀廷嘅睇法，同我哋成班人搞初選無干」，並同意李運騰指，他想將「35+」與該文章分開（dissociate）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指大殺傷力武器說法源於美伊戰爭-區指沒想過視為對使用憲制權力的包裝&quot;&gt;官指「大殺傷力武器」說法源於美伊戰爭 區指沒想過、視為對使用憲制權力的包裝&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷曾提出立會過半作為「大殺傷力憲制武器」，陳慶偉續指，認為「大殺傷力武器」概念最早於逾20年前的伊拉克衝突出現，當時美國以此為由入侵伊拉克，以推翻當地政府（overthrow the government），並問戴提及該概念時，區如何理解。多名被告面露愕然，鄭達鴻發笑、鄒家成和吳政亨皺眉，亦有被告說「痴線」。區答：「我冇諗到之前嗰啲法官閣下講嘅歷史背景，我會視之為佢（戴耀廷）對於《基本法》憲制權力嘅論述框架（framing），佢對於使用呢種權力嘅一種包裝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱擁護基本法和保證效忠特區是參選及妥為當選必要條件&quot;&gt;區稱擁護《基本法》和保證效忠特區是參選及妥為當選「必要條件」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑其後就初選提名表格發問，其中第6點列明「會擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特別行政區」。陳問到區諾軒及其他組織者是否有謹慎確保加入這個條款？區同意，稱「我哋作為大會，我哋並唔想觸犯任何香港嘅法例」，又指初選期間「盡咗我哋嘅全力去防止任何犯法嘅行為發生」。區又指，若結合表格第5、6和7點來看，「我哋嘅意願，係希望參加初選嘅人都能夠妥為參與立法會選舉」，並指一個參選人能夠參選並妥為當選，「擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特別行政區」是「必要條件」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上展示表格第5、6和7點如下：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;5、我特此聲明，據我所知，我並無因《立法會條例》（第542章）第39條或任何其他法律喪失獲提名為候選人或當選之資格。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;6、我特此聲明，我會擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特別行政區。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;7、我並特此聲明，我是香港特别行政區永久性居民中的中國公民，並且沒有中華人民共和國以外國家的居留權。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續提及表格第5點，問初選參選人中有沒有人曾經被DQ？區稱以其所知有，不過他們作為初選舉辦人，「都可以叫係『打開門口做生意』。」這時被告席傳來笑聲及驚訝聲音，林卓廷無奈發笑並反問：「做生意？」區主動補充：「我知呢個比喻比較差，我意思係任何人都可以拎呢份表向我哋報名。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;提名表格須聲明不曾被dq-區承認是誠實制度沒想過按條款dq初選參選資格&quot;&gt;提名表格須聲明不曾被DQ 區承認是「誠實制度」、沒想過按條款DQ初選參選資格&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在陳仲衡詢問下確認，最終有曾被DQ者成功參加初選。陳續問，故第5點只是「整色整水（window dressing measure ）」？區指「我哋有呢個良好意願」，但收報名表時，「我哋冇諗過去DQ曾經被政府DQ嘅人」。李運騰續問，故就表格的第5、6及7點，是否沒有檢查的機制（checking mechanism）？區同意他們是使用「誠實嘅制度」，若參選人有作聲明，就不會被組織者查核。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡質疑，但組織者確實知道有人曾被DQ，區指誠實制度是要靠參與者留意條款，又強調：「我哋作為組織者，的確當時冇慎重去諗呢個問題」，因為「至少我相信民主嘅要素係包括參選權、被選權，我當時冇諗過因為呢啲條款要去取消人參與初選嘅資格」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，提名表格的第5、6及7點，是組織者自行制訂還是抄回來的？區指是趙家賢根據選舉事務處的報名表格模仿製作，是基於政府使用的真實報名表。李再問，第6點的「我會擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特別行政區」，是指擁護整個《基本法》？區同意。李追問：「即包括23條？」，區回答「係」。眾被告聞言起哄，其中林卓廷及陳志全等稱：「係囉！」，亦有人點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區重申協調會議目的非討論當選後做什麼無就運用否決權詳細討論&quot;&gt;區重申協調會議目的非討論當選後做什麼、無就運用否決權詳細討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，區同意到了2020年5月，雖然立會過半的願景清晰，但對當選後做什麼仍有分歧。陳世傑指，區早前被問到泛民主派入議會後會否一致投票時，曾表示需詳細討論，問是否指5月時需要就此作更多討論？區指當時未有需要再討論這類事情，並解釋協調會議目的並非要討論當選後在議會具體做什麼，亦沒有就運用否決權作詳細討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑再問，就運用否決權是否沒有任何協議，區指「睇你點睇共同綱領入面第二條嘅條文」，即積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案。陳一度質疑，那只是「討論的項目」，又問區是否說「共同綱領」上有運用否決權的條款，區答「我哋喺啲文件度係睇到㗎，係冇得否認㗎」，強調在以「final.docx」命名的各區共同綱領上有出現該條款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區重申新東無就否決權達共識最終對文件條款也不滿意-5月初選焦點轉變惟參與者不被諮詢&quot;&gt;區重申新東無就否決權達共識、最終對文件條款也不滿意 5月初選焦點轉變惟參與者不被諮詢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續指，但新界東並沒有就運用否決權達成共識。法官陳慶偉指所有人都知道沒有共識，改為指是在協調會議上沒有共識，但不知何故「共同綱領」上卻出現了「共識」，區同意。區亦同意辯方指，文件是由戴耀廷準備，而區本人對運用否決權條款也不滿意（not satisfied）。陳續問，故在4、5月時，戴耀廷是否主要以個人的想法來前行？區指若以戴一直發表的文章為參照，會同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又引述區早前在 Trevor Beel 盤問下稱，起初認為戴耀廷撰文是「文責自負」，但後來看到參與者有不同意見，而戴「側埋一邊」，不斷指要用否決權和發展攬炒十步觀點，認為戴在組織工作上有問題。區同意，5月時「35+計劃」的焦點有所轉變，但參與者沒有被諮詢，並被鼓勵參與初選，惟陳仲衡指，有參與者對該轉變作出回應。區答「如果佢哋真係察覺到呢個改變」，並在李運騰追問下，同意5月5日新東第二次會議就「會運用」和「會積極運用」字眼的爭論，可視為有人察覺風向轉變。但區也再次確認，會議上沒有達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PHbMeNS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第31天。區諾軒繼續接受代表鄒家成的大狀盤問，同意鄒家成因對戴耀廷稱毋須簽聲明感憤怒，故發起「墨落無悔」，以向公眾展示抗爭決心。區同意，「墨落無悔」表明「會運用」否決權，與部分選區協調文件「會積極運用」字眼有別，同意有人或想比協議「行前一步」。新界東會上就否決權字眼未達成共識，但鄒家成在「墨落無悔」卻提及「協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領」，區在法官詢問下，表示懷疑是否有他不知情的「黑盒」過程，導致「共同綱領」和鄒家成用「會運用」字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，被問到拖延法案通過是否妥善履行立會議員職責，區表示立法會議員向市民問責，會用不同手法爭取選民所想，「無論投贊成定反對、認真審議定係去到拉布，都係佢哋向市民問責嘅方式。市民唔滿意嘅，下一屆就會選走佢哋。」法官則重申，控方立場不是說否決預算案就違法，只有「無差別」否決才違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意鄒家成對戴耀廷不要求簽共同綱領感憤怒-撰墨落無悔望展抗爭決心&quot;&gt;區同意鄒家成對戴耀廷不要求簽共同綱領感憤怒 撰「墨落無悔」望展抗爭決心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒繼續接受代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑盤問。陳世傑展示鄒家成在 Facebook 上的「墨落無悔」聲明書帖文，區確認自己曾就有關聲明回應，故有一定的理解。區同意該聲明是回應戴耀廷在6月9日記者會指參選人毋須簽聲明的說法，而鄒家成對此感到憤怒，不滿經過許多努力達成共同綱領後，卻沒有任何文件，於是發起「墨落無悔」，表達參選人需要簽署某些文件，以向公眾展示他們有抗爭的決心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nZHf5OW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ （鄒家成 Facebook Post 圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，該聲明的內容只是重複戴曾說的話，並無加插新的內容。惟法官李運騰指，鄒其實是想讓公眾知道戴沒有在會上說的話，因戴在會上沒有交代所達成的協議，區同意「呢個都係個分別」。區亦同意，「墨落無悔」無提及「無差別」否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指墨落無悔與部分選區共同綱領有別-使用會運用字眼較堅定&quot;&gt;區指「墨落無悔」與部分選區「共同綱領」有別 使用「會運用」字眼較堅定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，簽署聲明的人來自各個選區。李運騰續問，「墨落無悔」上的兩點聲明，與協調會議達成的協議是否相符？該兩點分別為認同「五大訴求 缺一不可」，「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」；以及「若支持度跌出各區預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」。區指第二點相符，但第一點卻不同，舉例聲明發起人之一的梁晃維是香港島候選人，但港島「共同綱領」是使用「會積極運用」而非「會運用」字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續問，那「共同綱領」（「會積極運用」）還是「墨落無悔」（「會運用」）使用的字眼意思較強？區指是後者，因為根據協調會議過程「『會運用』字眼係比較堅定」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續提及，區曾表示「會運用」否決權包含3個意思，包括視乎內容而用、為爭取五大訴求而用，及「無差別」地使用，而「墨落無悔」指的是第二個情景，區同意。區亦同意，聲明僅為「確保抗爭陣營參選人，有最基本的抗爭意志」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;新東無共識惟墨落無悔稱已取得共識-區懷疑有黑盒過程導致&quot;&gt;新東無共識惟「墨落無悔」稱「已取得共識」 區懷疑有「黑盒過程」導致&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰亦指出，聲明提及「我們認為，在初選協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領，乃一眾參選人之合作基礎」，似乎鄒是在提及會議上已達成的共識，區同意有這個意思。李追問，區曾指在新東所有協調會議後，就「會運用」或「會積極運用」否決權的字眼未有達成共識，但鄒卻似乎指已達成共識，究竟當時會上有否共識，抑或鄒是比起本來的共識「行前一步（went further）」？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區表示：「所以我嘅睇法係，喺當日嘅協調會議後，係咪有一個『黑盒』，就係有一個過程，最後係咪會導致到共同綱領或者鄒家成認為係用『會（運用）』嘅。」林卓廷一度說「吓？」，吳政亨亦用雙手掩嘴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李問區是否指發生了一些他並不知情的事？區同意，並解釋以梁晃維作為例子，是望指出有其他選區的共同綱領使用「會積極運用」字眼，但在「墨落無悔」出台後，簽署者卻表示「會運用」。李再問是否有人想比起達成的協議「行前一步」，區表示：「呢個係一個可能性」，亦同意這是個別人士的聲明，並非新界東的聲明。陳世傑續問，故聲明是否簽署者的「個人心願（personal aspiration）」？惟主控周天行反對指證人無法回答這個問題，法官亦指應留待陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指鄒家成會上向戴耀廷指議員一係投一係唔投-區指與其憶述有出入&quot;&gt;辯方指鄒家成會上向戴耀廷指議員「一係投，一係唔投」 區指與其憶述有出入&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒其後確認，在5月5日新東第二次協調會議上，鄒家成對戴耀廷提出使用「會積極運用」否決權的字眼有爭議。陳世傑指，當時鄒是表明否決權是由《基本法》所賦予，惟區指無法憶述到更多，但認為談及否決權時「必然係講緊《基本法》嘅權力」。陳再指，鄒其實是說議員在《基本法》下，「一係投，一係唔投（you either vote, or you don’t vote）」，區指「可以咁理解」。陳再指，鄒是想說，為何要用「會積極運用」這麼一個無說服力（lame）的用詞，應該更加肯定才對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時主控萬德豪起身，認為應問證人是否記得鄒曾這樣說過，而不是問對鄒想法的意見。陳慶偉要求區避席，指辯方有權指出案情，但認為根據新東會議的背景，鄒家成並非只提及可運用《基本法》權力，而是不同意「會積極運用」的字眼。陳世傑解釋，他想指出鄒曾在會上向戴指其用字不夠肯定，指作為議員「一係投一係唔投」，認為區在會上會對相關對話有認知。陳慶偉同意，但指區不能讀取鄒的思想，着他只問鄒家成曾否向戴提及相關說法，但就不要提及《基本法》權力的部分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒入庭後，陳世傑問，鄒成家在會上曾否向戴耀廷指「一係投，一係唔投」，區指與他憶述的句子有出入，重申鄒當時是質疑戴耀廷「點解係用『積極』而唔係用『會』，係咁多」，鄒家成發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問及逃犯條例條訂草案-區指法案委員會一片混亂&quot;&gt;辯方問及《逃犯條例》條訂草案 區指法案委員會一片混亂&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續就否決權發問，問泛民過往是否曾「否決（vetoing the budget）預算案」，惟法官李運騰指這與「反對（vote against）」預算案有分別，指過往泛民「反對」預算案，但因非議會多數，並不能「否決（veto）」預算案。區同意，如果有35名議員「團結一致否決預算案」，就是「veto」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續問及，區作為立法會議員時，是否曾就《逃犯條例》條訂草案投棄權票。區指他是反對《逃犯條例》，並投下反對票。李運騰問，當時是否曾就草案投票，抑或已被政府撤回？此時陳志全搖頭，被告席內亦有人討論。區回應政府於2019年10月宣布撤回，而草案曾進入法案委員會。李問有否進行首讀，區指「希望我冇搞錯，應該係」，但沒有上到大會和去到二讀，亦沒有表決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，他是反對該草案。被問如何反對，他指「我哋喺法案委員會不斷提出質疑」，又指「喺嗰個委員會入面一路都係一片混亂嘅，石禮謙好想入嚟，想入個議會，我哋民主派議員全力阻止」，多人發笑。林卓廷說：「大佬呀，我要打官司……」，並一度舉手，並湊近被告欄向律師說話。李運騰續問當時是否有舉行會議，區指當時「出咗一個叫『鬧雙胞委員會』」，陳慶偉指不需深究，李運騰亦指只望澄清當時雖沒有表決，但很多人已表達反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指立會議員向市民問責-無論投贊成或反對認真審議或拉布均是問責方式&quot;&gt;區指立會議員向市民問責 無論投贊成或反對、認真審議或拉布均是問責方式&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問，投票或不投票是否立法會議員的職責，區同意，但亦同意李運騰指，有議員是在議會製造各種麻煩，不希望會議舉行。區也同意，投票或不投票，及拖延法案通過都是議員的「權力」，陳世傑續問拖延法案是否妥善履行立會議員職責？惟陳慶偉質疑《基本法》沒列明議員有權拖延法案，區同意《基本法》沒列明，只列明投票的權力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，因此用「策略（tactics）」而非「權力」一詞會較合適？區指「立法會議員都係向市民問責嘅」，他們會用不同手法望爭取選民所希望的，「無論投贊成定反對、認真審議定係去到拉布，都係佢哋向市民問責嘅方式。市民唔滿意嘅，下一屆就會選走佢哋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方引林鄭稱否決議案是發揮憲制功能-惟官控方指控無差別否決才犯法&quot;&gt;辯方引林鄭稱否決議案是發揮憲制功能 惟官控方指控「無差別」否決才犯法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑其後引2016年7月時任政務司司長林鄭月娥會見傳媒的新聞稿，林鄭曾提及「條例草案或者我們的一些撥款項目提交了給立法會，但不幸被否決，這個我們接受的，這個結果我們是接受的，因為這是立法會發揮它憲制功能的一部分」，又指有關變性人的《2014年婚姻（修訂）條例草案》在社會和立法會引起很大爭議，故被否決，「這也是民主過程的一部分，所以特區政府是接受這個結果。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑問會否影響區對於否決權合法性的看法，惟法官陳仲衡指，不認為控方是指否決本身的行為是不合法，而是「無差別」否決才犯法，周天行同意。李運騰亦重申，控方已在開案陳詞和控罪清楚說明，只有當不考慮議案優劣，無差別否決議案，濫用立法會議員職權才是違法。陳遂沒有再繼續發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意特首下台和解散立會非其目的不關心任何人當選後工作計劃&quot;&gt;區同意特首下台和解散立會非其目的、不關心任何人當選後工作計劃&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑最後向區指出，「35+」從來不是關乎無差別否決預算案，區稱「要睇參與者點樣睇35+計劃」，陳再指，但根據組織者，這並非最初的目的？區指對他來說「一直都係揀選民主派代表進入立法會」。法官李運騰指，辯方將「組織者」當為一個整體，但區未必能代其他人回答，區附和「我只能代表我嚟作答」，重申他認為「35+」目標是為民主派爭取最大勝算。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑再指，「35+」並非要特首下台和解散立法會，區同意這並非他的目的，陳再指，「35+」並沒有預期參選人當選後不應做應有的職責，區答「我唔關心任何人當選立法會之後嘅工作計劃」，陳世傑遂表示完成盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官就九西第二次會議發問-區認無法區分出席者&quot;&gt;官就九西第二次會議發問 區認無法區分出席者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，法官李運騰詢問4月29日第二次九西協調會議上，提及戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步〉一文的詳情，當天是文章發布翌日。區笑言，「我真係諗唔起點解無啦啦會提起呢樣嘢」，只記得會議開始不久，類似是戴耀廷在介紹某些說法時，「張崑陽就話睇咗佢近日嘅攬炒十部曲文章」，其後戴就文章解釋，岑子杰並提出反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李問除了區、戴、岑和張外，當天還有誰在場？區略顯猶豫，指記得參與初選的人都有親身或派代表出席，但劉偉聰曾指他其實沒出席第二次會議，區承認「我係區分唔到嘅」，因他在錄影會面憶述兩次會議出席者都屬「總體的印象」，「所以我有記錯係唔奇嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第31天。區諾軒今接受代表柯耀林的大狀盤問，同意柯可被歸類為溫和民主派、亦非知名政治人物，被問到柯在新東初選得票不足1%是否因不夠激進，區指「攞得多票唔一定激進先得」，但同意柯並不激進；而對辯方指協調會議上參選人互相攻擊，但柯一言不發，區同意「柯先生係好沉默嘅」。辯方亦指出，民主選舉候選人常擺出「政治姿態」，但實際上無意實踐其主張，而柯簽「墨落無悔」是避免被攻擊，惟法官質疑區無法回答，辯方遂沒有繼續發問。審訊下周一（27日）繼續，控方透露另一控方證人趙家賢將作供，屆時他需先在庭上閱覽約8千頁的文件證物。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指認識柯耀林多年-他離開民主黨後成立區政聯盟-主要關注地區議題&quot;&gt;區指認識柯耀林多年 他離開民主黨後成立「區政聯盟」 主要關注地區議題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;下午由代表柯耀林的大律師葉海琅盤問區諾軒。西九龍法院附近的長沙灣潤發倉庫今發生三級火，葉甫站起就表示「附近有火警」，法官聞言發笑，陳慶偉笑言：「你想參與救火嗎？（“Do you wanna join the fire service?”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於盤問下，區指認識柯耀林多年，柯曾為民主黨成員，於2018年與部分成員離開民主黨，並在2019年5月與部分離開的成員成立「區政聯盟」，組織內有不同政治組織，包括「將軍澳民生關注組」、區政聯盟大埔團隊、北區團隊，以及「沙田區政」。區知道柯是屬於「將軍澳民生關注組」，亦得知組織內各人有不一致的政治立場，而各組織並不能互相代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，區政聯盟關注地區議題，多於影響全港的政治議題包括普選，其主要成員是區議員及地區工作者，並沒有立會議員，在初選期間亦主要關心地區事務。法官李運騰問到，柯是以個人身分抑或代表將軍澳民生關注組參選，區指柯代表區政聯盟參選。葉其後展示柯的提名表格，政治聯繫一欄顯示為「區政聯盟」，但李運騰質疑表格上無列明他是否代表區政聯盟參選；區回應指：「參選表格畀佢哋寫政治聯繫，我會視之為佢係代表該組織參選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區不知柯有否與戴耀廷見面討論初選&quot;&gt;區不知柯有否與戴耀廷見面討論初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡追問，初選中不只將軍澳的選民可投票予柯，新界東所有選民均可以，區同意。葉海琅其後指，雖然柯的政治聯繫是區政聯盟，但並非指他代表該組織參選，因他並沒有得到區政聯盟所有組織的同意（authorised），區表示：「我冇關心當時柯先生有幾代表區政聯盟。」葉續指，戴耀廷曾於2020年2月至3月與區政聯盟見面討論初選，但柯耀林並無出席，區表示不知道戴與甚麼人見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指柯首次會議中途離開-傳譯主任錯譯left為slept多人大笑&quot;&gt;辯方指柯首次會議中途離開 傳譯主任錯譯「left」為「slept」多人大笑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉海琅續指，同年4月14日的新東第一次協調會議，區政聯盟共4名成員出席，包括柯耀林、大埔區的區鎮樺、沙田區政的李永成及丁仕元。葉問區是否知道這麼多成員出席協調會，是因他們尚未決定多少人或誰代表參選，區指不清楚原因，他們亦無提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉續指，在協調會議上，參選人的討論主要關於私人恩怨的人身攻擊。法官陳仲衡追問會議歷時多久，區指兩小時，陳疑惑：「兩小時的人身攻擊？」李運騰續問區，在會議上是否有很多人身攻擊，區表示應該有，但笑言「真係唔記得具體係咩嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉指出，柯在會議上一言不發，區指：「就我憶述，柯先生係好沉默嘅。」葉再問，區是否記得柯在會議中途離開，這時法庭傳譯主任將「left（離開）」聽錯為「slept（睡覺）」，並錯譯為：「記唔記得佢瞓著咗？」，引起眾被告包括柯耀林和旁聽人士大笑，法官陳慶偉亦哈哈大笑，區諾軒亦笑到彎身指「我唔記得……」，傳譯主任則道歉稱：「Sorry.」最後區表示不記得柯有否在會議中途離開。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指柯因西貢區議會開會無出席第二次協調會-區稱與憶述有出入&quot;&gt;辯方指柯因西貢區議會開會無出席第二次協調會 區稱與憶述有出入&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉海琅其後就新東5月5日的第二次協調會議發問，區確認會議於晚上7時至9時，在教協位於旺角中僑商業大廈的會址舉行。葉呈上同日西貢區議會的會議記錄，列明出席者及出席和離開的時間，當中顯示柯耀林於早上約9時半出席會議，最後在晚上10時40分離開。李運騰打斷指這屬於傳聞證供，除非有人就此作證，否則不能作為柯沒出席的證據；加上區並無出席此會議，並沒有資格回答，但若這是辯方案情，可直接指出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉遂直接向區指出，柯沒有出席第二次協調會議，是因為他正出席區議會的會議。區表示：「同我憶述係有出入嘅。」至於同樣有出席該次區議會會議的范國威，區確認他沒有出席第二次協調會議。此時柯耀林聳肩。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意柯耀林為溫和民主派印象中並不激進-得票少於1&quot;&gt;區同意柯耀林為「溫和」民主派、印象中並不激進 得票少於1%&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉海琅其後展示柯耀林的提名表格，其選舉單張顯示「重整香港 港人至上」，葉指出其政綱並無提及「攬炒」的概念和否決財政預算案。葉續指，柯可被歸類為「溫和（mild）」的民主派，區回答：「就我多年對佢嘅認識，我同意。」葉亦指出，柯並非知名度高的政治人物，因他在初選中落敗，只獲1,489票，少於整體的1%，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉追問，柯得票少並落敗的原因是他並不夠激進？惟法官陳仲衡質疑，區無法代不投票予柯的人回答。法官陳慶偉則建議葉可轉用另一方式提問，指柯未能獲得足夠選票，是否可能因為他不夠激進？區表示：「攞得多票唔一定要激進先得嘅，不過就我對佢喺初選裡面嘅印象，佢並不激進。」林卓廷一度說「係囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意簽墨落無悔是以防參選人開空頭支票的措施&quot;&gt;區同意簽「墨落無悔」是以防參選人開「空頭支票」的措施&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉海琅亦問，即使取得立會過半，兩次否決預算案致特首下台的謀劃是否極之不可能實現？法官一度質疑相關問題已出現過很多次，區則回應：「我會話係基於好多前設先至去到最後呢一步嘅，換言之有唔少困難。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉其後問區，是否同意在民主選舉，候選人常擺出「政治姿態（political postures）」，但實際上無意實踐其主張（without any real intention to achieve）？法官陳慶偉質疑是否指柯說謊，並認為可改問：「參選人當選後，是否仍可能有很多因素影響他實踐政綱？」區同意。陳仲衡續問，故簽署「墨落無悔」是一項以防參選人開「空頭支票（empty promises）」的措施？區稱「可以咁講」。彭卓棋發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指柯耀林簽墨落或是政治姿態免被攻擊-官稱證人無法回答&quot;&gt;辯方指柯耀林簽「墨落」或是「政治姿態」、免被攻擊 官稱證人無法回答&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉續問區，柯耀林簽署「墨落無悔」有沒有可能只是一種「政治姿態」，以避免被人攻擊。但李運騰質疑區只能「揣測」，除非辯方是想指出區知道柯耀林沒有意圖實踐其政綱，指應留待陳詞交代。葉一度欲問其他參選人為何簽署，但法官再質疑區無法得知，且「墨落無悔」亦非大會文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉表示這是最後一條問題，陳慶偉反駁：「就算是最後一條問題，都要有技巧地問（“… you still have to ask in a skillful way.”）」，多名被告和律師發笑，林卓廷亦大笑。葉最終改問，「據你理解，是否同意有部份溫和民主派簽署『墨落無悔』，是不想讓選民以為……」，惟即被陳慶偉打斷，指問題並不好，李運騰亦指這太過揣測。陳慶偉最後無奈表示：「Listen, Mr. Cheung (應為 Mr. Yip). I need a break.」，多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢將於下周作供-需在庭上閱覽8千頁文件證物&quot;&gt;趙家賢將於下周作供 需在庭上閱覽8千頁文件證物&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;休庭之後，葉海琅表示沒有進一步提問，鄒家成一度面露驚訝張開嘴。代表李予信的大律師關文渭亦表示，將不會對區諾軒進行盤問。區諾軒離庭時，向法官、控方及旁聽席三個方向分別鞠躬三次。現時所有被告盤問完畢，尚餘代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀因控方新呈文件有少量問題補問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪續指，控方覆問預計約2小時，第二名控方證人趙家賢將於下周作供；而因為沒有一份所有被告均同意的同意事實，故需透過趙家賢將約8千頁文件證物呈堂，他需檢視全部8千頁文件。法庭原定下周一下午休庭，控方提議安排趙於該段時間在庭上以電腦閱覽，李運騰指需要超過半天，但萬表示只需少於兩小時。陳仲衡一度問萬：「你可以在兩小時內閱讀8千頁文件嗎？」萬回應若他熟悉該些文件是可以的。法官陳慶偉終批准申請，指屆時法官將不會到庭，只會派書記在場，而各辯方大律師及被告則可自行選擇是否到庭，並不得和趙家賢交談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（23日）踏入審訊第30天。區諾軒今繼續接受代表何桂藍的大狀盤問，就有參選人簽署「墨落無悔」聲明書，區指雖有保留但尊重，認為屬各人自由，但同意簽聲明可謂「內鬥」和綑綁他人，可以的話寧願沒有該份聲明，但同意即使無聲明，DQ的風險一開始已存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區又同意，發起「35+」初衷是不想浪費選票，並強調不是要推銷或販賣希望，因《國安法》落實、亦可能出現DQ，民主派或未能取得過半議席，同意謀劃可能會「失敗」。辯方問，故最後「35+計劃」只是一個夢？法官亦問是否「註定失敗」？區答「好難一概而論」。此外，區同意於2020年前一段時間已認識何桂藍，曾接受她訪問，同意辯方指她是「醒目的政治記者」；又同意35+計劃暫停後，各參選人做的的決定亦是「自主」的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒國安法後撰文指香港已經破局-定期選舉和高度自治受影響&quot;&gt;區諾軒《國安法》後撰文指「香港已經破局」 定期選舉和高度自治受影響&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今繼續接受代表何桂藍的大狀 Trevor Beel 提問。Beel 展示區諾軒文章〈思考後35+民主派的未來角色〉，區稱約於2020年8月撰寫，投稿《蘋果日報》刊登。文中提及「香港已經破局」，區解釋當時看到《國安法》已經通過，立法會選舉亦決定延期，他指的破局就是這意思。法官李運騰指，理解人們談及「破局」是希望達致新的局面，Beel 追問是破了什麼局？區指是「定期選舉」和「高度自治」，李運騰問即這兩樣東西已不再存在？區答：「至少受到影響啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指抗爭派政治立場未必完全統一不隸屬任何政黨&quot;&gt;區諾軒指抗爭派政治立場未必完全統一、不隸屬任何政黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒早前被法官問及「抗爭派」的意思，區以出席抗爭派記者會的人士歸類，形容他們在民主派系中站在「較進步」的位置，指「佢哋都好多元」，又指鄒家成、余慧明和何桂藍為抗爭派。Beel 問，「較進步」的意思是否「較積極（more proactive）」、「較肯定新意念（more assertive with new ideas）」？區答「立場上、行動上都有呢個意思」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 亦問及「多元」是否指「多樣化（diversity）」，區指抗爭派政治立場未必完全統一，同意 Beel 指集合了不同意見和想法的人，而出席抗爭派記者會的人並不隸屬任何政黨。Beel 其後一度提及，區諾軒2019年曾因議會上的行為而須守行為，他在法官詢問下指不是要質疑證人品格，並問區會否將自己歸類為較進步的陣營，區答：「喺我在任立法會議員期間，我都係相對喺一個進步嘅陣營裡面。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問區為袁嘉蔚助選是否支持抗爭派理念-區稱會替所有港島候選人助選&quot;&gt;官問區為袁嘉蔚助選是否支持抗爭派理念 區稱會替所有港島候選人助選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區確認，袁嘉蔚曾出席抗爭派記者會，歸類她為抗爭派，而他曾於7月為袁嘉蔚助選，何桂藍在場，在延伸庭的袁雙手掩面，其後發笑。法官陳慶偉問，這是否代表區諾軒支持袁的抗爭派理念？區指「我冇話特別支持邊個理念」，解釋因他曾任香港島立法會議員，故當時做了一個決定，即向所有參與香港島初選的候選人表示「我會公平分配時間為你哋所有人助選」，故當時他為袁助選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，袁嘉蔚有簽署「墨落無悔」，對區來說不是一個問題（not an issue）？區指「我冇關心任何人簽墨落無悔嘅簽署，呢個係各人嘅自由」，亦確認他沒有向簽署者表示任何反對，但補充曾於6月19日在 Facebook 發文回應抗爭派聲明發起人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱沒關心任何人簽墨落無悔屬各人自由-但同意屬內鬥寧願無&quot;&gt;區稱沒關心任何人簽「墨落無悔」、屬各人自由 但同意屬「內鬥」寧願無&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示該篇〈以正視聽——假如我有資格回應抗爭派立場聲明書發起人〉，區表示雖然內文對簽聲明者一些看法表達保留，但可顯示他沒有明顯反對他們立場。法官陳仲衡問，但文中提及「就不同黨派的公開回應，不見得有參與者對運用權力否決財政預算案態度保留。那大家反對的是誰？」，似乎區是同意參選人公開表達否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區引文中「就算所有人都聯署簽紙，只要有人到時反悔，除了譴責，根本無法阻止」，指當時有此說法，是尊重他們會運用否決權的動機；而他作為大會一分子，不希望人們繼續質疑大會，故指出看不到有人公開反對否決，以說服抗爭派聲明發起人。惟陳仲衡再指，若區只是尊重他們想法，不會說出「若35+攬炒，否決預算案重要」。區解釋該句是指若發起聲明者相信35+是為了「攬炒」、否決預算案是重要議題，就應該落力宣傳，文中亦有提及「參與者間繼續夾到出血，效益很少」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問他是否暗示「墨落無悔」是參與者的「內鬥」、一派嘗試綑綁其他人？區同意，鄒家成一度發笑。李再問，故可以的話，區會寧願沒有「墨落無悔」？區答「可以咁講」，並表示當日在組織者群組曾指「就算講否決預算案都好啦，係有一個詮釋嘅空間」，但若「不斷去叫人表態」，「就會將一種模糊性收窄」。Beel 續問，區諾軒本人是否不反對在立會過半後，以否決預算案作為談判籌碼？區指「我冇特別關心用唔用否決權嘅問題」，但「立會過半增加與政府談判的籌碼」是他的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官引區文章稱對大局為重投黃成智感羞恥指35初心是不浪費選票&quot;&gt;官引區文章稱對大局為重投黃成智感「羞恥」、指35+初心是不浪費選票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在李運騰提議下，庭上其後展示區6月9日在 Facebook 發布的〈人與人最可貴的 是建立制度 - 發起35+的初衷〉一文，區確認於同日的初選記者會後發布。陳慶偉問文章是否反映區參與「35+」的初心？區指文章用了很多主觀詞語，但主體想法沒有離開其初衷，並引文中「這是我發起35+協調的理由」及「失望是源自明明有過半數民意，多區卻太多人參選，分拆選票，得不到該正確反映的議席數」，區同意其初心包括不浪費選票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續問及文中「過了那麼多年，也為第一票是投給黃成智感到羞恥」一句，多名被告和旁聽人士發笑。區笑指「其實我都唔係好想令到佢尷尬㗎」，解釋他成年後投下的第一票，是2008年立法會選舉投給當時屬民主黨的黃成智。而他後來加入民主黨曾與黃共事數年，「我一時記唔起當時候佢做咗啲咩嘢，但係到最後佢係離開咗民主黨」，此時在旁聽席的民主黨劉慧卿笑說「唔係離開，係踢走」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，他稱覺得羞恥是因為「我唔認同佢嘅政治立場」，但當年投票給他是因「大局為重」。李運騰問，故區的想法是即使他不喜歡某個候選人，但仍會因想民主派爭取最多議席而投給他？區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱沒反對戴耀廷用會積極運用字眼-因認為範圍與講到好盡有差距&quot;&gt;區稱沒反對戴耀廷用「會積極運用」字眼 因認為範圍與「講到好盡」有差距&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續問，這是否也是區在6月9日後，沒有對戴耀廷指立會過半是「大殺傷力憲制武器」的說法表示反對的原因？區稱「可以咁講」。陳續指，區曾指當天是他與戴想法出現分歧的分界線，而當天記者會上沒有特別事情發生，問區是否為了在立會選舉爭取最多議席，故沒有反對戴的想法？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指「我要小心啲講戴耀廷嘅諗法係乜」，又望解釋當時他的認知，惟陳慶偉打斷，指理解區的想法是認為按《基本法》權力否決預算案沒有錯，區同意。陳續問，因此區當時同意戴的想法？區指當時認同「積極運用基本法權力」的字眼，是因他察悉到不同參與者有一個「政治立場的範圍」，「我相信呢個維度呢，呢個 spectrum，係同戴耀廷去講到件事係好盡嘅，係有差距嘅」，又指「我同佢（戴耀廷）合作都係事實」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後問及，若區認為運用《基本法》的否決權沒問題，故使用「會運用」或「會積極運用」字眼並不重要？區答：「喺《國安法》立法之前，的確冇為意到會係一個問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指不想推銷或販賣希望-同意國安法及dq下35或失敗&quot;&gt;區指不想推銷或販賣希望 同意《國安法》及DQ下「35+」或失敗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文中另提及「而從來，從來不見得有甚麼希望好賣。給你35+，國安法猶存，議會仍然可以DQ、不承認當選」，Beel 問「議會仍然可以DQ、不承認當選」有何意思。區指當時提「35+」，「都唔係話一啲好好推銷嘅希望」，李運騰問是否不想給予社會假希望，區指「我會話唔係去賣一啲希望」，因當時《國安法》立法，議員亦可能被DQ。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再問，因此區宣傳「35+」不是想帶來美好願望，而是前方仍有困難？區同意，指簡單來說，若真的出現DQ，「民主派好有可能去到新一屆立法會係唔夠35個議員」，同意李運騰指謀劃因此可能「失敗」。陳仲衡指，不過該段最後也有提及即使如此，「在九月贏最好的仗」，區同意是指立法會選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱dq風險一開始已存在-以黃之鋒為例指無墨落無悔亦可因政治聯繫無法入閘&quot;&gt;區稱DQ風險一開始已存在 以黃之鋒為例指無「墨落無悔」亦可因政治聯繫無法入閘&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，區發文時雖望盡力達成35+，但他其實意識到這是難以實現的？陳慶偉則指，當時一定有現實的前景，否則他們怎會搞初選？區其後同意，他撰文時對35+計劃能成功有疑問，並指是由「墨落無悔」發布後開始出現，但法官質疑他撰文時「墨落無悔」並未發布。區遂改稱撰文時《國安法》將立法，即使未有聲明也認為DQ的「風險一開始已經存在」，會設想某些候選人因政治聯繫無法參選。他舉例，黃之鋒「之前一路都冇得入閘」，據政府以往做法估計是因為他是香港眾志成員，故會預期參與九東初選的他「好難通過到個審查」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，在「墨落無悔」發出前，並沒有聽過參與者要求簽署聲明。法官陳仲衡問該聲明對他來說是否很出奇？區指因「墨落無悔」是公開聲明，並指他現時也無法確定指候選人或被DQ的輿論，是在6月9日記者會後或聲明發出後出現。區並補充，若說令計劃出現無法執行的問題，要視乎6月中後輿論有多大程度指出候選人有DQ風險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;35是否只是一個夢註定失敗-區好難一概而論&quot;&gt;35+是否只是一個夢、註定失敗？ 區：好難一概而論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，DQ是達致35+的障礙。Beel 問，如果在功能組別不能取得足夠議席，就不能得到足夠票數否決預算案？區指有兩個層面，包括民主黨有否足夠人參選功能組別，以及參選功能組別者抱持什麼立場，因如他早前所述，大部分民主派功能組別參選人「都冇話要否決財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，故最後「35+計劃」只是一個夢（“In the end the 35+ scheme was just a dream?”）？並不會發生？李運騰亦補充，即區知道35+是註定失敗（bound to fail）？區答「好難一概而論」，Beel 一度再追問那據他個人的感覺如何？惟陳慶偉指「Thank you, thank you」，李運騰亦指可留待陳詞，Beel 終沒有繼續發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意2020年前已認識何桂藍-此前曾接受何訪問&quot;&gt;區同意2020年前已認識何桂藍 此前曾接受何訪問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，於2020年前已認識任記者的何桂藍，此前也看過其文章。Beel 問據其文章，她是否一名「醒目的政治記者（astute political journalist）」，傳譯主任一度未能譯出「astute」，Beel 以帶口音的廣東話說「醒目」，多人發笑，區答「可以咁講」。區亦指，記得在2020年前何桂藍曾訪問他，但他不記得是哪篇訪問，Beel 提出是2015年區任區議員時，區指「有可能」，同意在2020年前一段時間已認識他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意戴耀廷是計劃領袖曾指區議會主席是協調會議公證人&quot;&gt;區同意戴耀廷是計劃領袖、曾指區議會主席是協調會議公證人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉亦就不同議題發問。陳指根據記者會片段，似乎計劃的領袖是戴耀廷，而涉案文章大部分也是由戴撰寫，區同意，亦同意他是被李卓人和李永達邀請擔任初選的協調者。陳續問，區會否視其謀劃中的角色與趙家賢相似？區答「相若，不過我哋負責嘅嘢始終唔同」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉又問及，初選記者會上曾有區議會主席出席，問他們在35+的角色是什麼，是組織者一部分，抑或角色較有限？區指「我理解就好有限嘅」，並指記者會上戴耀廷曾提及協調會議過程有區議會主席見證，「當有一日唔同嘅與會者有異議，咁佢哋就會作為一個公證人講返會議係乜嘢嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意35暫緩後各人決定為自主&quot;&gt;區同意35+暫緩後各人決定為「自主」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在陳慶偉詢問下亦同意，初選後數名組織者曾在 Facebook 公開宣布35+計劃暫緩。陳問計劃暫緩後，是否代表初選參與者已不再受他們簽過的聲明或共同綱領所約束？區答「呢個係我嘅睇法」。陳再指，因此在初選落敗的楊雪盈也會報名參選立法會，區指「或者廣泛啲嚟睇，當大會唔再運作，大家跟住做嘅決定，係自主嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒主動釐清預算案議事程序-確認任議員所提修正案全遭否決&quot;&gt;區諾軒主動釐清預算案議事程序 確認任議員所提修正案全遭否決&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，區諾軒昨被問及財政預算案議事程序，提及撥款條例草案先交草案委員會，其後財委會召開特別會議討論，議員可提出修正案。區今甫開庭主動就相關議事程序作釐清，指財務委員會舉行特別會議時，議員負責書面質詢政府，至於昨天提及的修正案則是在立法會二讀後的全體委員會審議階段表決，最後到三讀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，相關程序是否基於區諾軒對議事規則的理解，如想知道確實程序便要參考規則，區同意，並笑稱「我還柙兩年，都係盡力記得返我之前所經歷嘅議事程序」。Beel 其後指，區在2018年任立法會議員期間，曾就撥款條例草案提出約60個修正案，主席只接納其中14個作表決，區指不記得實際提出多少，但數字與他記憶類近，並確認他提出的修正案全部因分組點票而無法通過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區確認新東無就會運用或會積極運用否決權字眼達成共識&quot;&gt;區確認新東無就「會運用」或「會積極運用」否決權字眼達成共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒又確認，有出席新東4月14日和5月5日的兩次會議，首次會議主要談及協調機制，至少以取得6席為目標，但對最後派出6席抑或7席參選未達成共識，「留咗呢個尾巴。」區亦同意第二次會議就協調文件用「會運用」抑或「會積極運用」的字眼作討論，但沒有達成共識。Beel 續指，參與者是否對否決預算案沒有明確立場？區指他所憶述不同參與者的立場已在早前作供「講晒啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區亦確認新東曾於6月28日舉行選舉論壇，並同意自己出席過大部分論壇，只有一至兩次沒出席，但對出席了哪幾次已無印象。Beel 問區是否論壇組織者，區指「我幾乎係全盤負責」，並同意辦論壇目的是讓候選人表達自己的使命宣言（mission statement），令人投票予他們。Beel 問及，論壇上所有候選人唯一一致的訊息，是否鼓勵人們出來投票？區指「我冇特別計過邊個講、邊個冇講」，李運騰指區不肯定有否出席該論壇，不認為其證據有比重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法庭因咪高峰問題休庭逾一小時&quot;&gt;法庭因咪高峰問題休庭逾一小時&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，早上開庭後近一小時，法庭的音響系統出現問題，部分咪一度發出嘈雜聲音。法官提醒毋須發言的大律師關掉咪。其後於盤問期間，有咪再次發出更嘈雜的聲音，甚至覆蓋法官的說話，最後法官陳慶偉於10時41分下令休庭予職員維修。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;休庭期間，有兩名技術人員嘗試修理，更換部分放在律師桌上的咪高峰，又一度翻查說明書，Beel 一度笑說「我們找到元兇了（“We found the culprit.”）」。有職員於11時15分指將開庭，惟咪高峰再傳出雜音，職員於11時26分指將於12時開庭，終於12時10分開庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（23日）踏入審訊第30天。區諾軒今開始接受代表鄒家成的大狀盤問，重申「35+」主要目標僅立會過半，非令政權倒台，「冇諗過亦都唔想犯法。」區同意各區就否決財政預算案沒有達成共識，惟戴仍將相關條款加入協調文件，法官李運騰聞言指戴挺「硬銷」，區同意「係幾硬銷」，惟被問到文件是否非參與者共識，區則指「大家可能有分歧，我哋好難一刀切話嗰樣嘢係 yes or no」。辯方提出，戴耀廷發出相關協調文件只是「邀請各人同意」，惟區指該文件沒列明是「邀請函」；但區同意，新西參選人最終簽署協議並夾附在提名表格，是個人對於協調文件的「回應」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區重申35目標僅立會過半非令政權倒台冇諗過亦都唔想犯法&quot;&gt;區重申35+目標僅立會過半非令政權倒台、「冇諗過亦都唔想犯法」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大狀 Trevor Beel 下午完成盤問，輪到代表鄒家成的大狀陳世傑盤問。就「35+」的目標，區同意2020年初時希望香港民主有進展、有好的制度和政府，而「35+計劃」並非要令政權倒台，主要目標只是想立會過半，有更好的談判力，讓泛民對政府政策有更有意義的影響。區同意，參與計劃時「我冇諗過亦都唔想犯法」，並強調「我哋真係盡咗全力去避免觸犯任何法例」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CxlFBKI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 代表鄒家成的大律師 陳世傑&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就本案的協議，區同意要先訂立協議的範圍和條款，並在協調會議討論。陳世傑問，當中是否只有少數項目達成共識？區指「睇你講係咩項目」，「我會話討論嘅嘢實際唔係真係好多。」區同意，戴耀廷在會議擔任領導角色，但最終共識是由各區決定，亦同意有很多不同人參與，「唔係咁容易」達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就選舉論壇，陳世傑問部分人是否表達過「挑釁性」的看法？法官李運騰亦指，根據片段有候選人被其他人猛烈攻擊。區表示論壇上「的確係有一啲好 provocative （挑釁性）嘅辯論」，辯方問是否不是針對其他人，而是針對制度，李運騰問什麼制度，陳世傑答「共產黨」，李糾正中共是當權者（authority）而非制度（system），多人發笑。陳再指，即使參與者的看法可能是挑釁、激進甚或瘋狂，也只是代表他們個人的看法？區稱「可以咁講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意戴加入運用否決權字眼為紀錄-官質疑草擬方式指已達成協議&quot;&gt;區同意戴加入運用否決權字眼為「紀錄」 官質疑草擬方式指「已達成協議」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑其後展示「35+計劃」文件，區同意文件顯示計劃主要目的，包括「五大訴求 缺一不可」，及在立法會取得35或以上的議席，該文件曾在部分協調會議展示。區同意，就各區最後達成的4項共識，其中3項包括舉辦初選、目標議席數目和替補機制都有在該份文件提及，至於舉辦初選論壇則沒有提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，運用權力否決財政預算案的條款沒有在該份文件出現，而是在協調會議中途才由戴耀廷提出和加入文件，最初與會者反應「不是太熱烈」，亦沒有達成共識。陳其後展示「35+立會過半計劃 民主派港島協調機制（初稿）」文件，第二點提及參與協調者「認同若民主派能取得立法會一半以上的議席，會積極運用立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳問區，為何沒有共識下，戴耀廷仍加入上述條款，區指戴在不同區的協調會議都有提及運用否決權的事情。陳問是否作為「紀錄」，以表達戴曾在會上提出或討論過此項目？區同意，並認為是「暫時的討論紀錄」。但李運騰質疑，根據其草擬方式，似乎並非討論的項目，而是已達成協議，區指「可以咁講」。他亦同意法官陳仲衡指條款中有「認同」的字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官稱戴無共識下加入否決權條款挺硬銷-區都係幾硬銷嘅&quot;&gt;官稱戴無共識下加入否決權條款「挺硬銷」 區：都係幾硬銷嘅&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，港島協調機制初稿是在3月26日首次會議後不久發出，而在該次會議前，只有3月24日九西會議曾討論該條款，但並沒有達成共識，惟事後戴在九西初稿加入相關條款，李運騰笑指其實那是戴的主意，區指「可以咁講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問，文件表面上看來是已達成協議，但實際上沒達成協議，李運騰亦指若文件是作會議紀錄之用，戴耀廷將上述條款列入其中是「不正確」，區表示：「所以我會話戴耀廷『希望』人認同第二點」。李追問：「他的做法挺硬銷，對不對？（“He was rather hard selling, isn’t it?”）」林卓廷聞言大笑，陳世傑再問，即戴的想法與現實是兩回事？區稱：「咁你可以睇到佢不斷寫文，開會又講，咁都係幾硬銷嘅」，有被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續問，條款提及「五大訴求」中「重啟政改以達雙普選」一項最初是否「要求特首下台」，並於2019年夏天改變為爭取雙普選，區同意，並主動重提張炳良著書指「完全係講呢個過程」，陳世傑打斷指毋須深究。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指戴耀廷單方面聲稱協調文件達成共識-區好難一刀切話-yes-or-no&quot;&gt;辯方指戴耀廷單方面聲稱協調文件達成「共識」 區：好難一刀切話 yes or no&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑其後就戴耀廷於6月8日，在組織者群組發出以「final.docx」命名的各區協調文件發問。陳指，區曾形容該文件包含各區「共識」的說法是不正確，區回應戴耀廷發出文件後在6月9日記者會視之為「共識」。陳續指，這只是戴單方面聲稱的「共識」，區指至少文件曾在各區協調會議上提及過。陳續問各人是否還未同意文件內容，區指「所以我一路話，唔同人對於呢個講法係會有唔同嘅睇法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳其後展示一份已簽署的「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新界西協議協調」文件，問戴耀廷發出各區協調文件的「final」檔，是否只是意圖邀請各人同意（invitation to agree）？區表示：「如果你話要一個候選人簽紙嘅就係認同，咁新界西呢個佢就認同咗嗰個共同綱領」，但亦認為不同參加者有不同看法，要視乎6月9日記者會的內容。陳世傑重申當天記者會亦是戴的單方面聲明，區指難以表述的是始終戴有參加各區的會議，但他同意戴類似提及各人已達成共識並反映在協調文件上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續問，戴耀廷的說法是否不代表其他人同意？區表示：「我真係唔敢講有幾多人係認同或者唔認同」，只能指開會過程的確有表達過不同意見，「我當然亦都唔敢講係咪個個人都睇過（協調文件）並且係有佢（戴耀廷）嘅睇法」。陳續指出，最終版本的文件並不包含各區共識，區指「大家可能有分歧，我哋好難一刀切話嗰樣嘢係 yes or no」，林卓廷說「嘩」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意新東就否決權條款傾唔成-辯方指戴耀廷發文件僅邀請人同意&quot;&gt;區同意新東就否決權條款「傾唔成」 辯方指戴耀廷發文件僅邀請人同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在法官李運騰詢問下，確認自己有出席所有新界東的協調會議，因此會知道會上各人有否達成共識。李續問，據區理解，最終新東就「會運用」或「會積極運用」否決權的字眼達成了什麼共識？區答：「無論係用『會積極運用』定『會運用』，都冇辦法得到與會人士嘅共識」，此時鄒家成攤開雙手聳肩。李追問，事實上是否沒有就該條款達成任何共識？區指「佢哋傾唔成」，鄒家成發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李再問，區6月8日在組織者群組看到戴發出的「final」文件時，認為是甚麼？認為文件旨在記錄已達成的共識，抑或是戴邀請各人同意？陳慶偉再指或者是戴耀廷捏造出來（made up）？區表示他只留意到該些是檔案，「我冇特別將佢諗成係大家已經做咗共識」，又指「如果你話係邀請人，咁嗰個檔案就會話係一個邀請函啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指新西參與者簽文件屬個人對文件的回應非共識-區可以咁講&quot;&gt;辯方指新西參與者簽文件屬個人對文件的「回應」非共識 區：可以咁講&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳其後再展示已簽署的新西協調文件，指有人在其上簽署，是否代表他已閱讀和同意該份文件，而該份已簽署文件是對相類似「final」檔案的「回應」（response），區同意。陳再指不是稱這是新西的共識，強調文件只是由個人簽署、只屬個人的事，區指「可以咁講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，所有新西候選人報名時均有夾附共同綱領，李運騰問除了尹兆堅外，是否所有新西參選人均同時有簽署「墨落無悔」？區指沒有統計但應該是。陳慶偉再問，候選人個別自願簽署及提交有關聲明，但是否代表是新界西的共識？區指「我冇開過新界西個會議，但係佢哋有交呢份嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。其中陳慶偉今配戴口罩，疑身體不適，說話聲線亦比平常小。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（22日）踏入審訊第29天。區諾軒繼續接受代表何桂藍的大狀盤問，表示「墨落無悔」提及會用權否決預算案，是增加參選人被DQ的風險，但承認聲明上無提及「無差別」否決。區亦同意，雖然35+目標是要求政府回應「五大訴求 缺一不可」，但組織者對進入議會後的計劃無詳細討論、參與者亦無清楚說出過半後具體部署，亦沒有討論由誰帶領民主派。法官李運騰一度問，即使是戴耀廷也不能指揮？區指「可以咁講」，亦同意戴沒要求參選人簽文件，但「墨落無悔」就要作出表態，「係對組織者嘅一個異議」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，區同意戴曾提及以立會奪半作為「政治籌碼」，而區曾於訪問指拿到35+能「奪權」是「笑話」，他解釋香港「行政主導」、立會權力有限，即使民主派立會過半「仍受制於既有框架」；又指首次否決預算案後特首有權決定是否解散立法會，在第二次否決預算案後才必須下台。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱墨落無悔增加被dq風險-惟承認無提無差別否決財案&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱「墨落無悔」增加被DQ風險 惟承認無提「無差別」否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今繼續接受代表何桂藍的大狀 Trevor Beel 盤問。區早前同意辯方指，參選人被取消資格（DQ）是爭取立會過半無法移除的障礙，他今同意於2020年6月已意識到這個問題。法官陳仲衡指，若政府越早開始DQ，替補機制便越早開始啟動？區同意，指理論上候選人被DQ就要找到替補人選，並指若參選人在提名期被政府要求回答問題，「佢就應該要預計有機會被取消資格」，亦記得提名期中間，政府曾就部分人士提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，是否即參選人在選舉論壇的說話或會令他們被DQ？區指確切地說，若候選人「講咗一啲我暫且稱為超越紅線嘅說話啦，佢就會增加無法參選嘅風險」，而之所以用「風險」一詞，是因當刻他無法知道政府是否真會將相關言論視為DQ的理據。李運騰問「墨落無悔」聲明書是否其中一項？區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，區諾軒認為聲明書上哪點會令參選人有風險？區指如前所述，當時有輿論指若罔顧後果地否決財政預算案，會被視為不尊重《基本法》，但因無先例可循，故只能「主觀地估計」。辯方其後展示何桂藍在專頁發布的「墨落無悔」聲明書，區同意當中沒有提及「無差別」否決預算案，當時亦無法知道政府會否提問，但認為就提及「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」的第一點，會設想政府可能會問曾簽署聲明者，「請問佢係以乜嘢目的去運用否決權？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，「墨落無悔」於初選之前發布，當時並不知道誰會報名參選立法會，區同意。Beel 再問，那在6月份，區對DQ會否使「6 6 4 4 3」目標無法達成是否沒有很大關注？區回應：「我哋冇人有水晶球知道民主派一定能夠成功協調好，並且能夠妥為分配選票。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱初選其他文件不公開故政府無法就此提問對有參選人表態感好煩惱&quot;&gt;區稱初選其他文件不公開故政府無法就此提問、對有參選人表態感「好煩惱」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，35+目標是透過協調機制避免浪費選票，盡量爭取最多議席，而參選人公開作出聲明，會危及該目標。李運騰指，其實風險一直存在，只是「墨落無悔」將風險增加？區點頭，舉例「候選人本來冇一份資料畀政府提問佢嘅，但有咗份聲明，就有可能被政府拎嚟提問」。區同意李運騰指，初選有不同文件，包括「35+計劃」、及包含「會／會積極運用」否決權的共同綱領，該些文件向參與者發放但均沒有公開，故政府只能接觸到公開的「墨落無悔」並就此提問。區也同意，初選論壇上部分候選人的公開言論也會增加DQ風險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區早前提及，對2020年6月越來越多候選人作「政治表態」感到「好無奈」，認為「若果用咁多心機準備初選，到頭嚟候選人被取消資格，白費咗好多義工、好多人嘅心機」。Beel 問他當時是否對部分參與者感到不滿或不高興？區答：「我覺得好煩惱囉。」區並同意，他作為立法會議員曾否決預算案，「當時真誠地相信，（否決預算案）只係履行緊基本法賦予嘅權力啫。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉一度問，「墨落無悔」下的名字是誰加上去的，區答「真係唔知道」，有份發起聲明的鄒家成發笑。李運騰一度指，何桂藍的名字在岑敖暉後、彭卓棋前，表面上看來應是何簽完後再有人加名字在後面？區指根據FB帖文操作，只有管理者可以更改當中內容。李運騰指若他不知道，就不要猜測，區笑說「咁我唔好估計啦」，李又指因他們不熟悉FB運作，「你比我們年輕，我們想你或許知道」，區再笑說「我盡力協助大家」。李指沒關係，是控方而非區須證明，又指若果沒有證據，就是沒有證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意組織者無討論入議會後計劃-即使戴耀廷亦不能指揮泛民&quot;&gt;區同意組織者無討論入議會後計劃 即使戴耀廷亦不能指揮泛民&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒同意，新一屆立法會期開始5個月後，即2020年2月底至3月初是一般財政預算案首讀的時間。Beel 續問，但似乎組織者沒有討論過民主派在那5個月要做什麼？區答「冇討論過，太遠啦」。李運騰指，但迫使政府回應「五大訴求 缺一不可」的目標仍然存在？區同意，只是就如何達成沒有詳細討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 一度指，認為用要求政府「回應（respond）」而非「迫使（force）」的字眼較適合，李指「墨落無悔」是用「迫使」一詞，即使「回應」也是對威脅的回應（respond to a threat），或者「強烈說服（strongly persuade）」，法官陳慶偉則指是「威嚇（to cow somebody）」，李指可留待陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後指，根據區的證供，民主派當選後，沒有實質計劃或討論誰負責帶領其他人。區同意，並指據其觀察，「由2016年起，民主派嘅狀況就係咁」。區同意李運騰指是「分裂（fragmentation）」的狀態，並指當時立法會經常以「四大版塊」歸類不同民主派議員，同意李運騰指難以說有人帶領泛民主派。李再問，即使戴耀廷本人也不能指揮泛民（even Benny Tai himself is not in command of the pro-democratic camp, isn’t it?）？區指「可以咁講」。李再問，「墨落無悔」是否可視為挑戰35+組織者的決定？區回應，若戴耀廷無要求參選人簽署文件，但「墨落無悔」就要作出表態，「係對組織者嘅一個異議」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訪問提否定中共極權-區指政府做法好極端立會過半可籲政權勿走極權路線&quot;&gt;訪問提「否定中共極權」 區指政府做法「好極端」、立會過半可籲政權勿走極權路線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示區諾軒4月30日在 Facebook 轉載的《蘋果日報》訪問，〈民主派或五區齊初選定出線權 區諾軒：以「35+」否定中共極權路線〉。陳慶偉問，文章標題「以『35+』否定中共極權路線」有何意思，區指當時正值反修例運動，看到很多政府的做法「係好極端」，「若果民主派喺立法會攞到35+，可以話畀政權聽，唔應該再行極權或者極端嘅路線。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，文章第一段亦再提及「否定中共極權路線」，又指「明言標榜中間派人士若仍意欲尋找『好啲嘅特首』了事，不僅是保守，更是過份天真」，問區是否指中央選擇的特首是不好。區指當時有此說法，是因雙方都很「劍拔弩張」。陳慶偉指區某程度上是談及特首下台，區問可否閱覽訪問其他內容，笑言「我驚我……」。Beel 此時指，他展示文章是有問題想要問，問能否由他而非法官先問，陳慶偉指「No, thank you」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區其後表示，訪問背景應是中央重新詮釋《基本法》第22條（有關中央不得干預本港事務），當時政府一夜間更改新聞稿內容，「當時令我覺得，一國兩制下嘅高度自治空間，係有收窄嘅意思。」區續指，當時社會上一些政團如希望聯盟表示，「不如搵個中間啲嘅特首就可以解決到香港嘅問題」，但他認為只是揀選「中間啲」的特首「係冇辦法真係應對香港市民關心嘅問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱首次否決財案後-特首可決定是否解散立會-惟再否決便須下台&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱首次否決財案後 特首可決定是否解散立會 惟再否決便須下台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續引述區在訪問表示「在行政主導的體制下，議會極受局限，『所以話攞到35+係奪權，其實係笑話』」，問區「笑話」是甚麼意思。區指香港奉行行政主導制度，而立法會可運用的權力有限，根據《基本法》第47條有很多行政限制立法部門的措施，因此即使民主派於立法會有過半議席，「佢哋依然都係受制於既有嘅框架。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問到若立法會兩度被解散，特首是否必須下台？區表示「講到去最盡係會有呢個情況」，但他亦指若沒有記錯，第一次否決預算案後，解散立法會的權力是在「特首嘅手裏面」；而第一次解散後重選，若財政預算案第二次被否決，特首才須下台。Beel 一度問，若民主派被重選為多數派，是否代表獲香港人的支持（mandate）？區表示若市民「始終係投返咁多個民主派議員嘅話，咁呢個的確係市民嘅意願」。區並指，法律機制的假設，就是期望特首與立法會「最後能夠傾得成一個可以通過到嘅預算案」，而特首下台後，就要重選特首，期間或由政務司司長臨時代替特首職位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，因此根據《基本法》，是交由特首決定是否解散立法會，並假設特首是「合理（reasonable）」的？區重申特首「會去到一個位置，要決定解唔解散立法會」，因若繼續現時立法會組成，除非能與議員談得攏一個可通過的預算案，否則無法通過恆常撥款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意重選立法會結果由選民決定有人以否決預算案作為手段&quot;&gt;區同意重選立法會結果由選民決定、有人以否決預算案作為手段&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，不過爭議或是關乎預算案以外的東西，陳仲衡補充如「五大訴求，缺一不可」。區表示可以有這種情況，意指「通唔通過財政預算案係手段，其他嘅政治目標先係目的」。Beel 續問若立法會被解散，重選結果是否由選民投票決定？區指政治人物會互相「縱橫捭闔」、「博弈」，「但對市民嚟講，重選時佢哋始終要作出選擇嘅」，舉例指市民會考慮若長期沒有正常撥款，對於日常生活而言有很大壓力，同意最終是由選民決定是否重新投選民主派為大多數。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續問，35+組織者之所以有相關謀劃，是否因為民主派在區議會中大勝，因此亦想在立法會選舉勝出？區同意。惟 Beel 指，區議會與立法會的機制並不相同，前者是直接選舉，區同意，指立法會只有一半是直選，並奉行「比例代表制」；區議會則奉行「單議席單票制」，而「其中一個問題就勝者會過份被代表」。此時何桂藍鄒眉並面露愕然，其後掩嘴發笑，余慧明亦發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒同意各派系對過半後部署沒有具體答案&quot;&gt;區諾軒同意各派系對過半後部署沒有具體答案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文中另提及「而成功爭取議會過半後的具體部署，則是各派系必須說服選民投票前要回答的問題。區稱，按其觀察，不同派系代表都期望未來能於選舉組合出基本綱領，但具體做法仍未有共識」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問到不同派別最後有否就具體部署提出答案，區指直至舉行初選，各派系仍沒有清楚說出具體答案，雖然在協調會議中曾就共同綱領作出討論，但未有共識，至7月尾政府亦宣布選舉延期。Beel 一度指，組織者和參與者就像計劃一個行程，但不清楚抵達後要做什麼，區指「所以我呢篇文章都係講，唔同嘅派系，有唔同嘅想像，而佢哋係未傾清楚嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後續就各方的不同想像發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指戴耀廷目的是談判-區同意開天殺價落地還錢為談判策略&quot;&gt;辯方指戴耀廷目的是「談判」 區同意「開天殺價，落地還錢」為談判策略&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，辯方今亦展示戴耀廷3月3日文章〈反制警察政權就要立會奪半〉，提及「立會若能奪半，反對陣營就會多了一個重要政治籌碼，就是以威脅否決整份預算案來換取特區政府在某些方面讓步」。Beel 問，故戴耀廷目標是「談判」？區指文章有提「談判」，但要留意其基礎是以奪半作為政治籌碼，故若沒有否決預算案作為籌碼就沒有條件談判。Beel 指，即沒有過半就不能談判？區指「唔係話完全冇嘅」，指即使民主派過往一直在立法會佔少數，各黨派都可以與政府交涉。李運騰舉例即透過製造各種麻煩拖延議案？區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，在政治談判中，為了取得成果，雙方都需作出讓步。Beel 再問，為了讓自己有較強的位置，並不會向對方透露自己的底線？區認同有這種策略，指「有句廣東話叫『開天殺價，落地還錢』」。Beel 再問，區是否預期若政府作出讓步，民主派都會讓步？區指「如果大家肯一人行一步，就係啱啱我哋所講嘅談判」。李運騰指即一個手掌拍不響（it takes two to tango），若某方寸步不讓，就不能進行談判，區同意。李再問，區在論壇有否聽過參與者談及「先破後立」，區指「冇辦法忽然連繫到每一個言論」，但在李詢問下同意有聽過「破局」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再問，民主陣營的訴求是否普選，區同意。Beel 一度提及政府可能的回應，但被陳慶偉打斷，指 Beel 最終是要求證人揣測政府會做什麼，李運騰補充更是要揣測反對派會否同意妥協，但那涉及太多假設。李並指，認為 Beel 已成功提出有人或許想談判。Beel 表示會問最後一條問題，指普選是否五大訴求中最重要（paramount），惟李運騰再打斷，指證人只能代表自己，而非其他人回答，尤其他已表明民主派陣營光譜廣闊，Beel 遂沒有繼續再問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZNoz1nf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（22日）踏入審訊第29天。區諾軒繼續接受代表何桂藍的大狀盤問，認為主張否決預算案向北京施壓的攬炒一派，是「表達緊一種絕望」，因覺得長時間無法實現理想的香港，要用盡抗爭手段爭取「破局」，「置諸死地而後生。」區指「攬炒」是「雙輸局面」，並形容戴耀廷「攬炒十步」說法是「講到出晒界」。區解釋不認為需「置諸死地」時，一度指香港是「金絲雀」，法官指從沒有聽過，區續指記得有中共元老提及：「香港係一個紫砂茶壺，係冇必要打爛佢嘅。」翻查資料，前全國政協主席李瑞環曾以紫砂茶壺評論香港回歸，指有老婦將祖傳紫砂茶壺賣掉前，以為骯髒而將茶垢抹掉，結果令茶壺一文不值。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，庭上就翻譯問題爭議，其中提及攬炒一派主張「寧願你（北京）做得最赤祼」，法庭傳譯主任將「最赤祼」譯為「the most horrible things」，何桂藍起身反對，指其代表大狀不諳中文，錯誤翻譯嚴重阻礙其理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱攬炒派寧願北京做得最赤裸-解釋無法實現訴求亦望政權用好核突方法應對&quot;&gt;區稱攬炒派寧願北京做得最赤裸 解釋無法實現訴求亦望政權用「好核突方法」應對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 繼續就《蘋果日報》2020年4月30日對區諾軒的訪問〈民主派或五區齊初選定出線權 區諾軒：以「35+」否定中共極權路線〉發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文中提及公眾或候選人都對「35+」有兩種不同想像：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「其一是透過議會過半提高民主派的議價能力及政治力量，爭取五大訴求，『至於點樣爭取係冇人傾落去嘅，亦都好難去傾，因為牽涉到到時個政治局勢係點』；另一種是不惜攬炒，否決《財政預算案》等向北京施壓，『寧願你（北京）做得最赤祼，咁你唔好再令香港存有任何幻想』。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區一度指對文章英譯本有異議，因攬炒一派主張被譯成「we」，「會令人誤會包括我在內，所有人都有呢種諗法。」李運騰其後問，攬炒一派「寧願你（北京）做得最赤祼，咁你唔好再令香港存有任何幻想」，「幻想」指的是什麼？區指戴耀廷自4月起一系列有關攬炒的文章可以代表這派人的想法，「佢哋會覺得，就算我冇辦法爭取到想要嘅嘢，我都要你做得最赤裸」，意思是「你就算唔畀我去實現我嘅訴求都好啦，你都要用一啲好核突嘅方法去應對」。法庭傳譯主任將「最赤祼」譯為「the most horrible things」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;最赤裸譯成most-horrible-何桂藍質疑法庭翻譯出錯影響律師理解&quot;&gt;「最赤裸」譯成「most horrible」 何桂藍質疑法庭翻譯出錯影響律師理解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時何桂藍舉手，指認為傳譯主任翻譯上嚴重出錯，將「最赤裸」翻譯成「the most horrible」是完全錯誤，但她的律師並不懂說廣東話。李運騰指可讓區諾軒先完成該部分證供，惟何再指這嚴重影響她律師的理解（“It is seriously impeding my counsel’s understanding.”）。李着她保持安靜和與律師溝通，又指可確保本案法官能理解中英文（bilingual）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區表示「我試吓諗吓一個啱嘅翻譯」，並提議「將現象向公眾揭露（expose the phenomenon to the public）」，法官陳慶偉指不是現象，直譯應是「赤裸（naked）」，主控周天行同意。傳譯主任則解釋用「the most horrible things」是根據文章的法庭核證英文譯本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指攬炒一派表達緊一種絕望置諸死地而後生&quot;&gt;區諾軒指攬炒一派「表達緊一種絕望」、「置諸死地而後生」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，區提及戴耀廷攬炒文章代表較激進者想法，是否包括〈真攬炒十步〉。區指該文章於4月29日刊出，他做訪問時尚未看到。李再追問「幻想」指什麼，是否代表中央沒有真誠（sincere）看待「一國兩制」？傳譯主任一度將「sincere」譯作「重視」，其後更正為「誠意地睇呢樣嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，主張攬炒一派「冇具體指涉政治制度」，而據其解讀，他們「其實係表達緊一種絕望」，「佢哋覺得咁長嘅時間都冇辦法實現到佢哋心目中理想嘅香港，所以要用盡佢哋抗爭嘅手段，去爭取一個破局。當然亦有一種意思就係，置諸死地而後生嘅意思。」李運騰問是想將什麼置諸死地？區答「我唔知我係咪一個啱嘅位置講，因為我唔係好詳細研究佢哋嘅論述」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區再欲解釋時，李運騰指 Beel 要就翻譯問題索取指示。就「赤裸」的翻譯問題，Beel 一度稱有如「國王的新衣」。陳慶偉則指，辯方最終要說明的只是有兩個派別的想法，認為「赤裸」的翻譯如何並不重要（neither here nor there）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/n8UeQ4R.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指攬炒非戴耀廷所創戴演繹其版本-惟已脫離參與者看法&quot;&gt;區指「攬炒」非戴耀廷所創、戴演繹其版本 惟已脫離參與者看法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;午休後，法官陳仲衡主動提到，英文以「浴火重生（“Phoenix is reborn from ashes.”）」來形容「置諸死地而後生」會否較恰當，區同意是恰當翻譯，林卓廷亦附和：「火鳳凰啊！」區並同意 Beel 指，新界東4月14日的首次協調會議上沒有人提倡「攬炒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，「攬炒」一詞於2019年社會運動已出現，並已有一段時間，區指最早出現「攬炒論」是在連登等網上論壇，並同意與他在訪問提到的「攬炒」語境不同。區亦同意 Beel 指「攬炒」一詞並非由戴耀廷所創，戴是「演繹咗佢一個版本」，而區在訪問提及的是近似戴的版本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，否決預算案本身是否不會導致「攬炒」，區認為可以分開看，指否決預算案可以是單獨行為，而戴的「攬炒」中，否決預算案只是其中一個元素。被問戴提及的「攬炒」與35+是否並無連繫，區重申認為戴文章所述已脫離參與者的看法，只是戴個人想法而非任何人共識，但可被視為戴當時演繹「35+」看法的「演進」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指立法會最多令政府沒有適切撥款但不會令政府完全唔能夠運作&quot;&gt;區指立法會最多令政府沒有適切撥款、但不會令政府「完全唔能夠運作」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再問及文中兩種想像，區表示就透過立會過半提高議價能力一派，「財政預算案否決權係一種籌碼或者係一種能力嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指戴耀廷在很多文章談及類似看法，並引戴4月文章〈香港攬炒大對決〉，提到民主派正密鑼緊鼓部署立法會選舉，望奪取一半議席，「民主派明言若能成功，在明年就會否決財政預算案，到時立法會有可能被解散，特區政府也可能停擺。民主派的策略是以『攬炒』去迫使中共及特區政府就『反送中』所提出的五大訴求作讓步」，問區所指「否決權是籌碼」的想法是否相似。區指他是第一次看這篇文章，並認為該觀點其實應是屬於主張攬炒一派的觀點，在2020年4月或更早已經出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，若預算案被否決，只是「可能」會導致立法會解散和政府停擺，但立法會不會直接令政府停擺？區解釋，立法會最多令政府財政沒有得到適切撥款（insufficient fund），但不會令政府「完全唔能夠運作」，而政府仍可向立法會申請臨時撥款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指攬炒導致雙輸局面-望透過死局達致浴火重生&quot;&gt;區指「攬炒」導致「雙輸局面」 望透過「死局」達致「浴火重生」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，區如何理解上文「攬炒」意思，區一度猶豫「其實我係咪真係適切去……」，並指如一定要回答，就會說是「由否決財政預算案到特區政府停擺呢個步驟」。Beel 追問，「攬炒」包含雙方遭受破壞的意思，那是什麼被破壞？傳譯主任譯為「即係『炒』啲咩呢？」，有旁聽人士發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續指，知道政府遭受的破壞，但另一邊是破壞什麼？區表示：「既然政府運作都得唔到撥款，咁市民都係會受害囉。」陳再問該破壞會否指民主制度的崩潰？區進一步解釋，2020年社會上有很大矛盾，民主路亦很難有寸進，就他理解「攬炒」的意思，「就係政府冇辦法得益，市民都冇辦法得益，民主派作為代表市民嘅代表，佢哋都冇辦法爭取到佢哋為市民爭取嘅嘢」。他續指：「呢種狀態係一種壓力，點解要有呢一種壓力，係因為要有一個更大嘅目標去爭取，希望任何一方都能夠透過各種方法離開呢一種壓力狀態，最終就有浴火重生嘅嗰個結果。」這時何桂藍竊笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李問，區是指「攬炒」如「死局」（deadlock），最後無人得益，只有雙方損失？區形容這是「雙輸局面，lose-lose situation」。李追問，是否為了避免雙輸，才希望透過「死局」來催生新的局面？區答「我會咁樣睇件事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方以冷戰作為攬炒例子-官不同意指應是互相威懾&quot;&gt;辯方以冷戰作為攬炒例子 官不同意指應是「互相威懾」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 一度問，故「攬炒」是否達致一個「平衡」？陳慶偉指問題太抽象，Beel 遂改為舉出1960年代的冷戰作為例子，指當時兩邊即使有核武器但均不敢使用，因為雙方均會死亡，而這便達致「平衡」。惟法官陳慶偉表示，這並非「攬炒」，而是「互相威懾」（mutual deterrence），以避免某些事情發生；法官陳仲衡亦指，若按下按鈕（發射核彈）的話，才會造成「攬炒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱香港爭取民主不應出晒界-一度指香港是金絲雀辯方指是生金蛋的鵝&quot;&gt;區稱香港爭取民主不應「出晒界」 一度指香港是「金絲雀」、辯方指是「生金蛋的鵝」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 繼而就戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步〉一文發問，問為何區指戴想法瘋狂。區指他一直說初選是協調不同民主派派系，而就算要討論運用財政預算案的否決權，亦是《基本法》列明的權力，「但你唔需要用得着將件事推到去要攬住中共跳出懸崖。喺香港爭取民主，係唔應該將呢啲講法講到…我形容為出晒界。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡追問：「鳳凰不需要浴火（毋需置諸死地）？（“No need to burn the phoenix?”）」，區同意，並指「既然以前我哋都話香港係一隻金絲雀…」，此時被告席傳來驚訝聲音，有人稱：「吓？」，林卓廷、鄒家成及余慧明等發笑。李運騰指：「我沒有聽過這個說法，只是聽過生金蛋」，林卓廷說「係囉」，Beel 稱：「是生金蛋的鵝（“The goose that lays the golden egg.”）」，多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區於是改稱：「我用個好啲嘅比喻啦，我記得有一位中共元老話，香港係一個紫砂茶壺，係冇必要打爛佢嘅。」這時何桂藍等再發笑。翻查資料，前全國政協主席李瑞環曾於1995年以紫砂茶壺評論香港回歸，指有老婦將祖傳紫砂茶壺賣掉前，以為骯髒而將茶垢抹掉，結果令茶壺一文不值。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問戴的文章是否對將要發生的事有錯誤的前設（flawed premise），是不現實的，區同意當中基於很多假設。李再問既然區認為戴瘋狂，有否告知他，區表示有告訴他，但已忘記對方的回應，不過戴並無提及自己有錯，區亦不排除辯方指，其文章是想引起社會討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指若無法律風險及延期選舉-立會選舉結果公佈後會視為功成身退&quot;&gt;區指若無法律風險及延期選舉 立會選舉結果公佈後會視為「功成身退」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在盤問下表示，沒有因協調初選收取報酬。Beel 續問初選結束後，他的工作是否已完成？區先指「我尤其係退出咗初選啦，咁之後我都會視一切已經完結啦」，李運騰澄清辯方是問他若沒有退出，會在何時視自己的工作為完結，又問他還有沒有剩餘工作要處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指若沒有法律風險及延期選舉，其工作包括在初選投票日後，就香港島、九龍西和新界東3區商討出選名單數目，因該3區協調未完成；找香港民意研究所做民意調查；立會競選後期亦要監察棄選機制妥為運行，中間當然也有無數行政或財政工作。區並指，「當立法會選舉結果公佈，我會視為功成身退。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區表示與吳璟雋為大學校友-相信他能給予好的意見&quot;&gt;區表示與吳璟雋為大學校友 相信他能給予好的意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在盤問下同意，退出初選是因為擔心初選的合法性。區提及曾約見時任政制及內地事務局政治助理吳璟儁徵詢補救措施，Beel 問他何時與吳見面，區表示要翻查行事曆，但發現已無法找到6月23日之後的內容，他不肯定是已刪除還是沒有輸入資料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，記得於7月13或14日，即退出初選前的一兩天，在灣仔星街一間餐廳與吳見面。區指他當日早上主動聯絡吳，對方建議短暫見面，同意二人為大學校友，在他畢業不久後的校友活動上認識，其後吳任政治助理時，雙方在公務上有來往。被問到為何要找吳，區指他為政制及內地事務局聯絡人，兩人亦相識，相信吳「會畀到我一個好嘅意見」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱中聯辦譴責後亮起紅燈-政治判斷解散初選&quot;&gt;區稱中聯辦譴責後「亮起紅燈」 政治判斷解散初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意當時已收到戴耀廷有關初選合法的保證，但7月13日早上，中聯辦及港澳辦發聲明批評初選涉違法，區亦擔心會違法。被問為何稱因「政治判斷」決定退出，區解釋自己對法律無專業認識，但官方機構開始指責初選涉嫌違法，「我多少要向所有參加者、所有義工負責」，故政治判斷是「一定要解散初選」。李運騰續問：「是否見到亮起紅燈？（red light is on）」，區同意，又指初選前已知政制及內地事務局局長曾國衛曾批評，「咁呢個都係警號嚟」，但他當時沒有細心冷靜思考。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡其後問到，區諾軒擔心初選違法，是指初選投票，抑或否決預算案、解散立法會及特首下台等步驟，區答「初選整件事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指卸任民陣召集人部署離開政壇-惟因眾志找plan-b而參與補選&quot;&gt;區指卸任民陣召集人部署離開政壇 惟因眾志找「Plan B」而參與補選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後問到，為何區要於2017年9月離開民主黨，區指當時民間人權陣線召集人的職務已完結，「我當時候已經部署離開政壇，我亦都搵咗人接區議會嘅班，我當時認為冇必要一定要留喺民主黨。」辯方指他數個月後參與2018年立法會補選，區同意，解釋因當時香港眾志要找「Plan B」參選（羅冠聰被DQ），「我當時認為如果用得着我嘅時候，就使用我啦。」Beel 問他為何不加入香港眾志，區表示其政治理念與香港眾志「不全然相同」，而且無黨派身份有助他與不同黨派合作，參與當時選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後就立法會程序發問，區同意可就議案投「支持」、「反對」或「棄權」，Beel 一度問因此沒有人有「否決權」，惟法官打斷指證據清晰，沒有需要發問。區其後同意自己曾反對預算案，惟 Beel 問他有沒有看到議員慣性投反對票、《議事規則》是否沒有規定他如何投票、他是否有自由意志投票時，陳慶偉均禁止發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱曾提修正案惟功能組別成日投贏我哋建制主席不接納民主派議案&quot;&gt;區稱曾提修正案惟「功能組別成日投贏我哋」、建制主席不接納民主派議案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 亦問及財政預算案流程，區同意撥款條例草案先交草案委員會，其後財委會召開特別會議討論，議員可提出修正案。他指他與泛民主派經常提出修正案，但能成功通過「真係唔係好多」，「因為我哋係少數，同埋（在分組點票下）功能組別成日投贏我哋」，鄒家成和陳志全等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區又舉例當時由建制派陳健波做財委會主席，陳很多時因重複或各種理由，不接納民主派議員的議案。李運騰一度問，所以議案未去到投票，而是根本未能呈上議會？區答：「所以我哋要及時遞交呢啲議案」，並指「總會有（民主派修正案獲通過），有時建制派都會支持」，視乎議案內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰最後指，本案已接近原定日數的三分一，仍然在盤問首名控方證人，關注審訊進度。Beel 指希望他不是唯一一個導致審訊延長的人，並指盤問快要結束，只會就協調會議、選舉論壇和抗爭派等發問，預計明早能完成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

The engine is the heart of the combat air power and integrated weapon systems. Jet engines require sophisticated design and manufacturing expertise — which has been built up in aircraft engine–producing nations over decades — and not only produce thrust, but also power avionics and aircraft systems.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;This paper examines major non-U.S. players in the engine market, with a particular focus on both allies and potential adversaries. It also analyzes how China has sought to translate its growing technological prowess into a military engine industrial base. Beginning with British sales of engine technology to China in the 1970s and supported by Russian assistance after the fall of the Soviet Union, Beijing has been making a long-term concerted effort to develop an organic, fully indigenous, manufacturing capacity — albeit with mixed success. Evidence suggests China will continue to focus on developing this capacity, raising questions about both its military capabilities and how the turbofan market may evolve with the entrant of a new competitor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military jet engines power some of the most important combat capabilities for air forces around the world. The development, testing, and manufacturing of jet engines is a significant technical feat that industries in only a handful of nations can achieve. But there is a potential, serious new competitor: in recent decades, China has spent billions of dollars to grow its organic capability. The global engine ecosystem — and its links to global technology proliferation — may have played a vital role in enabling China’s campaign of learning. This brief seeks to determine how the global military turbofan engine market operates and whether there are possible avenues for technology proliferation that China has exploited as it seeks to build an organic jet engine industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-european-military-engine-ecosystem&quot;&gt;The European Military Engine Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest jet engines were designed in Western Europe during the early stages of World War II, with both Germany and the United Kingdom making substantial investments in the technology. After the war, British jet engine technology was transferred to the United States as part of their partnership. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union was able to capture German technology, giving it its foundation in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western Europe’s leading aerospace firms maintain a strong presence in the international market, specializing in selling 4.5-generation aircraft and their respective engines. France and the United Kingdom lead in fighter exports to countries outside of Europe, as shown in Figure 1. Of the major European aerospace exporters, the United Kingdom maintained the largest market share from 1990 to 2018, with the number of French exports gradually overtaking their British competitors after 2018. However, the growing popularity of the United States’ F-35 among European nations may disrupt European aerospace firms’ opportunity to sell their fighters and accompanying engines to regional customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rolls-Royce, the United Kingdom’s only jet engine manufacturer, plays a significant role in the global military and commercial turbofan markets. In its military business, Rolls-Royce engines have powered successive generations of European fighter aircraft. The Eurofighter Typhoon and Panavia Tornado feature engines developed by cross-European consortiums, but ones in which Rolls-Royce took on the most complex design and manufacturing tasks. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) also purchases Rolls-Royce propulsion systems for the B-52, C130, and F-35B programs. Its military output is, however, a comparatively small share of the company, with its commercial engines business accounting for roughly 2.5 times the revenue as that of military engines in 2021. This gives the company flexibility and the ability to sustain itself even when commercial or military business fluctuates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safran, France’s leading jet engine manufacturer, powers the majority of the French Air and Space Force’s (AAE) aircraft. Safran’s defense enterprise is financially supported by a robust commercial business that allows the firm to develop innovative technologies in tandem with foreign firms to enable broader market access. It does not enjoy formal links to the United States, since France pursues a “buy European” approach to aerospace defense procurements. However, this means that within the European Union, Safran is the most successful and sophisticated manufacturer of turbofan engines. Safran’s most advanced turbofan engines, the M88, began production nearly 30 years ago and have gradually been upgraded to power the Rafale series of aircraft; newer iterations of the M88 have 20 percent more thrust than the original model. Safran is currently leading a consortium of European firms to produce a new engine to power a sixth-generation aircraft that will enter service with the French, German, and Spanish air forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European government and defense contractors are beginning to develop sixth-generation aircraft platforms, comparable to the DoD’s Next Generation Air Dominance platform. The United Kingdom, Japan, and Italy are embarking on a sixth-generation fighter-development effort, the Global Combat Air Program, that will embrace expertise from across the three nations (and their largest defense contractors) in an effort to deliver home-grown combat air power. France, Germany, and Spain have also agreed to cooperate on a fighter aircraft, in what will undoubtedly be a complex industrial coordination effort. These two programs represent the bulk of future opportunities for European engine makers in the military turbofan space. Depending on the size of these aircraft fleets, future business prospects for military turbofans across Europe could prove to be limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;propulsion-on-a-budget-the-soviet-union-russia-and-the-struggle-to-evolve&quot;&gt;Propulsion on a Budget: The Soviet Union, Russia, and the Struggle to Evolve&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet Union built upon the technology it had extracted from Germany at the end of World War II to become a player in the engine market. During the Cold War, it exported a significant number of weapons to developing states at an affordable cost relative to Western equipment, a price dynamic that partially explains the prominence of Soviet and Russian turbofan engines abroad. The majority of Russian or Soviet fighter aircraft in use today are powered by Soviet-era turbofan engines that are comparable to the United States’ Cold War–era powerplants, especially when it comes to reliability and service life. As a result, Russian engines are not competitive relative to their current Western counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet Union was also able to be somewhat selective in whom it sold arms to and refused to sell weapons to China for decades, largely on political grounds. Post-Soviet Russia, however, has not had such a luxury, as financial pressures began to threaten its aircraft engine industry. As a result, Russia began making significant sales to China in the 1990s, a decision that could imperil the future of Russia’s export market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/e92uiFA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Soviet and Post-Soviet Military Aircraft and Jet Engine Exports, 1990–2021.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers&quot;&gt;“SIPRI Arms Transfers Database,” Stockholm International Peace Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collapse of the Soviet Union presented the Russian aircraft engine industrial base with a myriad of organizational and financial challenges. The newly independent Russian government privatized the Soviet-era engine-design bureaus while dramatically reducing procurement. This prompted the design bureaus to engage in costly legal battles with Boris Yeltsin’s administration to protest privatization or to try to reorient their new businesses to producing aero-derivative gas turbines. In the latter case, these aero-engine design bureaus typically partnered with Western firms to develop new technologies better suited to commercial uses. This dynamic likely presented Russia with several opportunities to reverse engineer Western technological and procedural innovations. Eventually, these Soviet-era aero-engine design bureaus merged to form the state-owned United Engine Corporation (UEC) in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ongoing challenge for Russian engine production is its lack of capacity in machine tools, which are vital to the precision manufacturing required for modern turbofan production. This capability gap derives from the advent of advanced computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools, meaning Soviet machine tools lost their competitiveness in the global market. As a result, Russia imported about 80–90 percent of its machine tools from 2009 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia had been rebuilding its machine-tool sector by the time it invaded Crimea in 2014, the nation was left unprepared to offset its reliance on Western imports when associated sanctions took hold. Specifically, Russia produced 3,871 pieces of machinery in 2014, up from 2,945 in 2013 — though its output tumbled by 14 percent in 2015 to 3,367 pieces of machinery as sanctions limited imports of components. Russia has managed to evade these sanctions in some cases, including by using shell companies. In 2018, the Ufa Engine Industrial Association, one of the largest subsidiaries of UEC, imported a German universal-grinding machine despite U.S. sanctions on the company. This tool is capable of resharpening existing tools to meet current and future production needs. Additionally, UEC Saturn imported machine presses from Germany in 2019 to manufacture engine blades for gas turbines, which could be repurposed for military applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As sanctions continue to tighten, Russia will likely inch toward near-complete isolation from the international machine-tool market for both new machines and replacement parts. Its aircraft engine production capabilities will continue to atrophy unless an alternative to Western machinery is found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-slow-climb-toward-indigenous-engines&quot;&gt;China’s Slow Climb toward Indigenous Engines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and its People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) have made significant investments in advancing capabilities to develop advanced air-superiority platforms, including a focus on fourth- and fifth-generation aircraft, with the PLAAF striving to operate modern aircraft, including the J-10, J-20, and J-31, in the near future. China is now able to develop and produce advanced airframes, although it still lacks the capacity to build fully indigenous aircraft engines. While China has certainly made improvements, it still lacks the manufacturing expertise and tacit knowledge required to build modern turbofan engines. In the past, China primarily turned to the United Kingdom and former Soviet Union for jet engines, as shown in Figure 3. However, as China’s needs have grown, Beijing has embarked on an ambitious indigenization effort that uses tools from across government and industry to offset foreign dependencies for key capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ur3GB3h.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Chinese Imports of Military Aircraft and Jet Engines, 1990–2021.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers&quot;&gt;“SIPRI Arms Transfers Database,” Stockholm International Peace Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s indigenous production of jets is relatively new, as the nation historically relied on imports from Russia to expand its fleet. SIPRI data show these countries are still major trading partners, with most Chinese imports of aircraft and jet engines from 1990 through 2021 originating in Russia. These imports have shifted from delivery of complete jets to that of engines. In 2001, China procured four Russian AL-31F engines, and this figure grew to 45 per year by 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese attempts to indigenize engine production began in the 1970s. The country’s initial efforts consisted of licensed production arrangements with established Russian and Western firms that exported parts, assembly lines, and necessary knowledge to China, which carried out the final assembly without needing to develop its own engineering expertise. This process allowed Chinese industry to gain access to the tooling and technical knowhow that it later deployed to produce indigenous engines, though ones that lagged their Western counterparts significantly in terms of reliability and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it took until 2013 for the production line to produce homegrown engines, drawing on the tooling and manufacturing support of Rolls-Royce. In 1976, Rolls-Royce sold the rights and machinery to produce its Spey MK.202 turbofan engines, intended for use in Chinese tactical ground-attack aircraft, to the Chinese aerospace industry. It was expected that it would take about 10 years — not 30 — for China to start production of the WS9 engine, its version of the Spey. While China gaining this capability is certainly a concern, it also demonstrates how difficult it has been for China to successfully complete an allowed transfer of technology, let alone reverse engineer Western turbofan engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s changing political environment and the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 altered the nation’s relationships with the West, and Western arms-trade embargoes meant that the United States and other nations were no longer reliable trading partners. However, Rolls-Royce temporarily continued exports of its Spey engine to China due to the United Kingdom’s deliberately broad interpretation of the embargo, which allowed exports of components of tactical fighter aircraft. In the face of criticism in the House of Commons, the UK government defended this policy by arguing that it was conducting a rigorous risk analysis that included “the risk of reverse engineering or unintended technology transfer” as a possible condition for denial of license. China thus shifted its sights to a financially strained Russia still recovering from the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In 1992, Beijing and Moscow signed the Military-Technical Cooperation Agreement, which outlined joint cooperative efforts and signaled both states’ sustained national prioritization of bolstering each other’s air forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this period, cooperative activities included technical-exchange seminars, coworking events, the sharing of experts, and — most notably — the exchange of production capabilities, theoretically giving China the ability to meet its own demand. Russia agreed to aid China’s domestic production of SU-27 aircraft by giving it both a license to produce the airframe and entire assembly lines sourced from surplus Russian machine tooling. As part of this cooperation, Russians worked closely with Chinese engineers in a consultative capacity within China’s factories. China developed larger aspirations for its engine capabilities and initiated work on indigenous production of aircraft engines. Beijing began to reverse engineer the technologies of the SU-27 aircraft that Russia had provided and that would form the basis for the WS-10 engine, which China began to market as an indigenously made and produced engine despite being deeply reliant on foreign technologies for knowledge and inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Moscow discovered this unauthorized replication, the Sino-Soviet relationship began to deteriorate. In 2019, Yevegny Livadny, the chief of intellectual property (IP) projects at the Rostec State Corporation, publicly complained about China’s imitation of Russian engines and aircraft. Livadny’s comments exemplified broader Russian frustration that China was illegally reverse engineering many Russian technologies so it would not have to pay Russia for additional products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-modernization-efforts&quot;&gt;China’s Modernization Efforts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 2017 report, Chinese analysts concluded that Beijing’s strategy to imitate rather than gradually develop indigenous technical knowledge caused it to lag international competitors. The analysts asserted that “China has no mature products for aviation engines; compared with the world’s aero-engine giants, we cannot be a first-tier supplier,” and China is “at the end of our industrial supply chain: our technical level and profitability is limited.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are additional signs of a lack of Chinese domestic expertise. China began development on its most advanced engine, the WS-15, in the late 1990s, but it is only recently beginning to use it an experimental capacity. The engine made its first flight on a J-20 aircraft sometime in 2022, according to Liu Daxiang, a Chinese expert who spoke at the 2022 China Aviation Industry Conference. In addition to trying to develop an engine that meets the thrust-to-weight requirements of fifth-generation aircraft, Chinese aerospace engineers are struggling to achieve meaningful reliability. Currently, Chinese jet engines can at best achieve one-fourth the life span of Western engines. This calls their reliability into serious question and suggests additional strains on China’s industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China seeks to expand its engine-manufacturing capacity, developing and acquiring key competencies is a core goal for Chinese government and industry so they can overcome existing hurdles throughout the manufacturing process. To this end, Beijing has worked to harness expertise and equipment from outside China, including by forming partnerships with Western universities to gain critical aerospace experience and expertise. Building talented human capital in the aerospace sector is vital to indigenous Chinese jet engine manufacturing capabilities, and external experience and expertise will help Chinese engineers improve both manufacturing and engine-development techniques. The United States, along with select allies and partners, has recognized this route to gaining tacit aerospace knowledge and has been working to limit access to certain programs for students who may pose a proliferation risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;manufacturing-challenges&quot;&gt;Manufacturing Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One barrier to Chinese domestic engine manufacturing is the availability of machine tooling that is suitable for aerospace applications. While the engines can be made of components completely produced in China, they are manufactured on Western machines. The most complex machine tools, five-axis and seven-axis systems, require immense engineering talent to manufacture and operate, and Chinese aerospace firms still have to import these systems from abroad — including from German, Japanese, Italian, and likely Korean firms. This dependence on the West for the most complex machinery limits comprehensive indigenization and, as China recognizes, is a source of risk for the country’s aerospace sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, machine tooling is a strategic capability with direct ties to the strength of a country’s defense-industrial base. Access to advanced 5-axis and 7-axis machine tooling dictates the ability to manufacture products such as large aircraft structures, compressor blades on turbines, and inertial navigation systems. Russia’s failures to manage these technologies during the 1990s and early 2000s led to a plummeting demand in the face of the global market and technological advances from the West. This may serve as a cautionary tale to Chinese defense planners as they work to build secure, indigenous capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another barrier to large-scale Chinese jet engine manufacturing is lack of knowledge of how to optimize the manufacturing process, despite attempts to exfiltrate this information. In 2018, Chinese-American citizen Xiaoqing Zheng was convicted by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for his involvement in stealing trade secrets regarding turbine sealing, a dual-use technology that is commonly employed in the development of aero engines. In another case, Chinese intelligence officer Xu Yanjun targeted experts employed by Western aerospace companies to both provide sensitive manufacturing data and speak to Chinese engineers in an effort to improve the country’s manufacturing processes. However, China has not yet been able to use the stolen information successfully to indigenize its aircraft engine industry. According to David Markov of the Institute for Defense Analyses, “Many of China’s scientists, engineers, designers, and production managers . . . lack the know-how that comes from apprenticeship programs and decades of specialized experience,” as is increasingly evident by Chinese firms’ inability to successfully integrate stolen IP, especially from the aerospace industry, into their indigenous manufacturing processes, a problem that could take decades to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engine market remains strong worldwide, with several competitors offering value to commercial and military users. The global nature of the market has also created opportunities for the United States’ competitors, namely China, to onshore components of jet engine technology. Despite numerous instances of jet engine technology proliferation to that nation, there is little evidence to suggest that China has, or imminently will, reach parity with Western engine technology. However, there is robust evidence that it is making a concerted effort to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ primary strategic competitors, China and Russia, face different challenges in producing turbofan jet engines. Soviet aircraft engines were not designed to turn a profit and historically could count on government subsidies to finance production. After the breakup of the Soviet Union and the disappearance of these subsidies, Russian aircraft engine firms lost production capability — but not their knowledge base. China faces the opposite problem; its production capabilities are largely restricted due to a lack of technical knowledge rather than a lack of resources. China has actively pursued opportunities to gain this knowledge by copying the innovations of other firms, engaging in partnerships that involve technology transfer, and working with universities around the world to gain new insights. China’s public recognition of its existing challenges signals that this is a priority across its managed economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To close its capability gap, China has been able to import advanced machine tooling from nations such as Germany, Italy, and Japan, which have supplied China with key pieces of manufacturing equipment it cannot produce domestically. It has also resorted to espionage campaigns to capture necessary manufacturing expertise. However, despite these efforts — and partly due to the complexity of the manufacturing process — China has been unable to reach parity with Western firms. Historically, Chinese engines have been lagging their Western counterparts by roughly 30 years. In recent years, China’s efforts to develop maritime turbines, which rely on less complex but similar technology, seem to have taken closer to 15 years. While it may appear that the West has a comfortable lead over China in the turbofan market, strategic surprise is possible as the Chinese workforce becomes better educated and the government continues to make significant investments in the aerospace sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is likely to maintain an enduring advantage in the engine market. However, if China grows its jet engine capabilities, it could not only increase its military capability but also potentially become a new market competitor with a demonstrated willingness to sell products at reduced costs to drive out competition. To reduce the chance of strategic surprise, the United States and its allies and partners may find it advantageous to take steps to limit China’s rise in this critically important industry. In the absence of such measures, an increasingly fiscally desperate and politically isolated Russia — more likely to take long-term risks — may upend the status quo by transferring sensitive technology to China. Understanding the historical impact that Western sanctions have had on the Russian aerospace industry could provide a valuable framework for confronting China; however, there are many confounding variables in the Russian aerospace industry, and additional research is needed to fully assess that case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies and partners have two broad options for managing the rise of China’s aerospace sector. First, they can carefully control what information China has access to and continue to be vigilant in preventing the unintentional transfer of sensitive engineering information, including in a university setting. Given the size of some Western firms’ business in China, managing the flow of information may prove challenging, but these firms do have an incentive to keep China from gaining foreign manufacturing expertise that could limit its future expansion. Second, Western countries and firms could restrict Chinese access to machine tooling and associated design and manufacturing software. While export controls are not completely effective, limiting China’s access to manufacturing equipment would make it far harder for it to build out a domestic industrial base. However, there is an underlying structural challenge in this approach because some machine tools are inherently dual use, making it easier for China to circumvent hypothetical sanctions. As China continues to seek to exploit the global engine market in an effort to gain turbofan manufacturing independence, it is up to policymakers and individual companies to fight back and carefully control the gains China can realize from the global turbofan market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China was able to access — or indigenously develop — enhanced technology, it could begin to close the qualitive edge that the United States and its allies have enjoyed for decades. As the United States shrinks the size of its crewed fighter aircraft fleet in the coming decades, maintaining that edge will be increasingly vital as China’s air dominance fleet expands. If the United States and its allies are unable to safeguard key manufacturing and turbofan technologies, further investments in U.S. and allied turbofan innovation could help to make parity with the West a moving target and blunt Chinese technical and manufacturing advances.&lt;/p&gt;

Beijing’s actions divide U.S. allies and likely deter countries from adopting positions and policies that may draw the ire of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). This could complicate Washington’s ability to push back on problematic Chinese behavior in other domains, including, but not limited to, its human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong and its expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While problematic, China’s economic coercion should be viewed with a sense of perspective; indeed, Beijing’s behavior provides an opportunity to advance U.S. interests in multiple ways.&lt;/strong&gt; A careful analysis of eight cases of Chinese economic coercion since 2010 — against Japan, Norway, the Philippines, Mongolia, South Korea, Australia, Canada, and Lithuania — reveals that the most salient characteristic of China’s economic coercion is that it simply is not very effective. Granted that there is likely a deterrent effect on third countries — albeit hard to quantify — China’s economic coercion nevertheless has a poor track record of achieving its immediate policy aims, and when it does, it often carries long-term costs for China. While Beijing has shown an ability to adapt and escalate when its initial response fails, it also has demonstrated an aversion to incurring costs, at times abandoning coercive measures that become too costly. This may, in part, explain why China’s economic coercion did not impose significant macroeconomic costs on the targeted country in any of the cases examined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic coercion can also counterintuitively work in the interest of the United States. For example, Beijing’s bullying has harmed China’s image around the world, pushing countries closer to the United States. It also creates the perception that China is an unreliable economic partner, which in some cases has prompted allies and firms to adjust their supply chains away from China. A strategy to counter China’s economic coercion should incorporate these nuances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence theory suggests two possible paths for a counterstrategy: punishment and denial. While punishment through tit-for-tat retaliation is superficially appealing, it has several problems. First and foremost, it faces an acute credibility challenge. Because China has so far resisted imposing significant costs on targeted countries, the threat of a proportional response from the United States would be unlikely to impose sufficient costs to alter Beijing’s calculus. However, if the United States threatened an escalatory response, the threat would quickly become noncredible. Retaliation might also unintentionally enhance the legitimacy of China’s economic coercion, which is often presented to the Chinese population in nationalistic terms, and might deprive the United States of the diplomatic moral high ground. Importantly, retaliation is likely not the response that targeted countries want from the United States, as China’s preference for coercing smaller countries means that targeted countries, not the United States, would bear the brunt of any escalation on the part of Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence by denial — focused on resilience and relief for targeted countries — is more likely to mitigate, and over time deter, China’s problematic behavior by decreasing its likelihood of success, frustrating Beijing’s intent. That is, where deterrence by punishment seeks to prevent an action through threat of retaliation, denial achieves its deterrent end by conveying the infeasibility of an action. A counterstrategy premised on deterrence by denial has several advantages over one based on punishment. Most importantly, it is more credible, for two primary reasons: First, a deterrence-by-denial strategy allows the defender to act first, eliminating the advantage China gains from informally implementing its coercive measures and putting the defender on the back foot. Second, providing relief does not require the United States to directly harm its own firms or consumers, as punishment implies. In addition, a strategy premised on deterrence by denial is easier to multilateralize, promotes decoupling where appropriate, provides the United States a more effective diplomatic message, and better aligns with the norms of the international rules-based system the United States aims to uphold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The counterstrategy proposed in this report is based on the logic of deterrence by denial and has two mutually reinforcing components: preemptive “denial” policies that aim to harden vulnerable economies against Chinese economic coercion, and reactive “deflection” policies that aim to negate China’s coercion by providing targeted relief to accelerate market adjustments, minimizing the political and economic pressure China can impose on the target. Together these resilience and relief measures are designed to frustrate Beijing’s intent by making targeted countries less likely to comply and, over time, to deter Beijing from its coercive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, this report recommends that the United States take the following preemptive denial steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish an interagency CoerCom.&lt;/strong&gt; To pool knowledge and resources, coordinate, and centralize U.S. counter-coercion strategies and initiatives, the U.S. government should establish a new interagency committee known as the Committee on Countering Economic Coercion, or CoerCom.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a coercion-denial coalition.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should take the initiative by unilaterally setting up its own counter-coercion policies but encourage other Group of Seven (G7) advanced countries to follow suit, emphasizing denial over punishment. While broadly signaling support for coerced partners, the G7-centered coalition should be cautious about explicitly extending an economic security umbrella too widely, at the risk of losing credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review vulnerabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Governments and firms at risk of coercion should conduct economy-wide reviews to identify potentially vulnerable industries and sectors. The United States can aid allies and partners by providing technical assistance with their vulnerability reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinforce supply chain resiliency.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and allies should make defending against China’s economic coercion an explicit objective of supply chain resilience initiatives such as those that emerged in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negotiate free trade agreements.&lt;/strong&gt; Washington can help strengthen resilience to China’s economic coercion by negotiating trade agreements that offer meaningful market access to allies and partners. This would reduce China’s market power vis-à-vis the United States while also speeding market adjustments in cases of economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a U.S. anti-coercion instrument (USACI).&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should establish an anti-coercion instrument similar to the one under development in the European Union but comprised of new and existing relief tools, including a new coercion compensation fund.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage partners to develop their own authorities.&lt;/strong&gt; Countries vulnerable to economic coercion should preemptively expand the authority of relevant domestic agencies to provide relief to sectors and firms affected when coercion occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following “deflection” steps after an act of coercion are also recommended:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define actionable coercion.&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. president should be given the authority to determine what constitutes an act of economic coercion on a case-by-case basis. CoerCom would provide the president with a recommendation to inform that decision, while Congress would have the ability to overrule the president’s decision with an up-or-down vote.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deploy the USACI:&lt;/strong&gt; Once an incidence of Chinese economic coercion has been positively identified, CoerCom would provide the president with a recommended set of relief policies authorized under the USACI. CoerCom should also be tasked with identifying possible opportunities to incentivize and speed decoupling of the targeted country from China in critical-technology and other strategic sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support World Trade Organization (WTO) cases.&lt;/strong&gt; Whenever possible, the United States should encourage the targeted state to bring a case against China to the WTO, which the United States and other G7 members would sign onto as third parties. Rather than solve the problem by themselves, these cases would signal disapproval by the United States and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance diplomatic messaging.&lt;/strong&gt; In both its denial and deflection efforts, the United States needs to employ robust public diplomacy. Preferably in coordination with other G7 countries, Washington should make public its efforts to build resiliency against China’s economic coercion and to offer relief to targeted partners, causing Beijing to update its assessment of the likelihood of success.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to an effective U.S. deterrence-by-denial strategy is maintaining credibility: offering real incentives to vulnerable countries to strengthen their economic resilience; not overcommitting to respond in all cases or in ways that neither China nor partners find plausible but following through with relief quickly when actionable coercion occurs; and ensuring domestic political support for counter-coercion measures, while visibly working to secure broader allied support. The counterstrategy proposed here may be less immediately satisfying than tit-for-tat retaliation, but it is more likely to deter Beijing from its disruptive behavior over time, while preserving the moral high ground for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Dalai Lama visited Ulaanbaatar in 2016, Beijing canceled bilateral meetings with Mongolia on finance and infrastructure. That same year, Seoul approved deployment of U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile batteries to Korea, prompting Beijing to force approximately 90 percent of Lotte supermarkets on the mainland to close over “fire safety violations.” In 2020, after Canberra called for an investigation into the origin of Covid-19, China restricted imports of Australian wine, beef, and other commodities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China has grown economically, so too has its propensity to engage in economic coercion. Although Beijing’s behavior has often been met with criticism, there has been little coordinated response from the United States or the broader international community. However, even without a response, the effectiveness of China’s economic coercion against states has been decidedly mixed. While Mongolia mostly gave in to Beijing’s demands, apologizing and promising the Dalai Lama would not visit again, the current administration in Seoul has stated it will not abide by the previous administration’s promise to limit certain military activities. Australia remains defiant in the face of China’s coercion and has aligned even more closely with the United States, as seen in the September 2021 announcement of the Australia–United Kingdom–United States (AUKUS) trilateral security agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not to say that China’s use of economic coercion has not been damaging. The deterrent effect of Beijing’s behavior is difficult to quantify. Governments may be less likely to challenge malign Chinese policies — such as military aggression in the South China Sea or human rights abuses — if they believe they will suffer economic losses in key industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s coercive economic measures also have divided allies and cleaved domestic politics in targeted nations. When exports from one country are blocked, a third country often stands to benefit, as was the case when U.S. coal exports to China increased at Australia’s expense. At the same time, private sector industries, which bear the brunt of Chinese economic coercion, lobby their home governments to avoid making statements or implementing policies that might anger Beijing, even at the expense of liberal values and national security. Moreover, China’s behavior undermines the norms that govern the international economic system. Beijing’s capriciousness erodes the trust that underpins international commerce while at the same time damaging the legitimacy of multilateral institutions, which are ill equipped to handle China’s destabilizing economic policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing and deploying a comprehensive counterstrategy to China’s economic coercion presents an opportunity for the United States to strengthen its image on the global stage; uphold the norms and rules of the international economic system; improve its strategic position vis-à-vis China; and mitigate — and over time deter — China’s problematic behavior. Based on insights derived from a careful 16-month review of eight historical and ongoing cases of Chinese economic coercion, two expert roundtables, and a crisis simulation, this report proposes a counterstrategy grounded in the deterrence literature and built upon the two mutually reinforcing components of denial and deflection. Together, these will help the United States deter China’s problematic use of economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-coercion-a-form-of-economic-statecraft&quot;&gt;Economic Coercion: A Form of Economic Statecraft&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic statecraft is the “use of economic means to pursue foreign policy goals.” The tools of economic statecraft vary but most commonly involve leveraging control over the flow of capital or goods to affect the decisions of other states or bolster strategic competitiveness. Out of normal international economic activity emerges economic interdependence, which states can weaponize to achieve strategic rather than commercial ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic statecraft policies may be divided into two primary categories: those that induce and those that punish. Inducements might take the form of trade agreements that offer nations market access or provide development financing to enhance stability. By contrast, punishments are implemented to coerce or corrode the target. In the case of the former, the aim is to influence the actions of the targeted entity and, in the latter, to erode its capabilities. Threats of punishment may also be used to deter adversaries, while their implementation can signal resolve and enhance the credibility of future threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, the line between inducement and punishment is blurry, as interdependencies produced by inducements can create new vulnerabilities to punishments. For example, China can foster warm diplomatic relations by granting access to its large domestic economy or coerce other countries for perceived affronts to Beijing’s prerogatives, while the United States can leverage the global position of the dollar to punish rogue nations and nonstate actors through sanctions or offer development assistance to induce countries to follow Washington’s lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic coercion, then, is best understood as a subcategory of economic statecraft and entails, according to Daniel Drezner, a “threat or act by a sender government or governments to disrupt economic exchange with the target state, unless the target acquiesces to an articulated demand.” It is difficult to measure the effectiveness of economic coercion, but according to the literature on sanctions, the effectiveness of a coercive economic measure weakens after implementation as alternative markets are found, costs rise over time, political coalitions within the sending state fracture, and views of the sending state harden within the target state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the United States and China employ instruments of economic statecraft in coercive ways to achieve desired strategic outcomes, and both have increased their employment in recent years, consistent with the ever-greater precedence placed on geoeconomic competition in the international system. However, there are important distinctions between when, how, and why the two great powers engage in economic coercion (discussed further below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economic-coercion-with-chinese-characteristics&quot;&gt;Economic Coercion with Chinese Characteristics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s history of economic statecraft stretches back centuries. The tributary system, developed under the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and maintained by the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), defined China’s foreign relations on a hierarchical basis and was largely sustained by trade and economic interests. Under the tributary system, economic relations were intimately linked with politics: to access China’s market, foreign envoys were required to pay tribute and kowtow to the Chinese emperor. As the Qing dynasty weakened in the latter half of the nineteenth century, and as the treaty system emerged in the middle of the century, China’s tributary system broke down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even on the brink of collapse in the early twentieth century, with the tributary system dissolved, the Qing dynasty still attempted to use coercive economic measures to achieve foreign policy goals. In 1905 the Qing boycotted U.S. goods in response to U.S. immigration policy. The Republic of China (1912–49) pursued the same policies, and between 1919 and 1930 there were numerous boycotts of foreign powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, China experienced rapid export-driven growth and underwent significant social and economic change. International trade boomed due to reform and opening policies, and China assumed a central role in the globalized economy. It is no surprise that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) (1949–present) continues to employ economic statecraft, including coercion, in pursuit of political goals, especially given China’s comparative advantages in the economic domain. For Beijing, economic coercion offers a relatively low-risk way of asserting its influence and standing up on the international stage for what it perceives as its core interests; coercion is a tool of statecraft that the CCP is actively seeking to sharpen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better illuminate the drivers and characteristics of China’s economic coercion, eight cases were examined in this study; they are summarized below and spelled out in more detail in the annex. The covered cases span roughly the past decade and were chosen because they vary in cause, method, severity, duration, notoriety, and outcome. As such, the cases do not represent a randomized sample.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-1-cases-not-studied&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1. Cases Not Studied&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cases in which Beijing threatened but did not implement coercion are not included in this study, nor are cases where China’s coercion was aimed solely at private firms as an end in itself rather than as a means to affect the policy of a government. The former were omitted because without implementation, there are no data to collect on what coercive tools China prefers, their cost, or their effectiveness. With coercion implemented, it is more straightforward to trace not only China’s but also the targeted government’s decisionmaking. Still, it is important to note that China has a propensity to issue empty threats of economic coercion.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cases of China’s targeting of private firms for perceived offenses are omitted because they represent a different problem set in need of a different solution. Although private firms may be more likely to cave to Chinese economic pressure than governments, they do not formulate public policy. By contrast, governments formulate policy, but they are more insulated from China’s economic coercion. For example, Beijing might target the National Basketball Association (NBA) because of a policy choice of the U.S. government in an effort to manipulate the NBA into pressuring the U.S. government to amend the policy. If successful, this coercion of a private firm would have a real effect on U.S. policy toward China. However, China’s coercion in this case would need to satisfy two conditions to have that effect: first, the NBA would have to acquiesce and pressure the U.S. government, and second, the United States would have to amend its policy because of this pressure. Thus, it does not strictly matter in this case if the NBA acquiesces to Beijing’s position, so long as it does not affect U.S. policy, which it did not in the real-world case in 2019.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Therefore, a counterstrategy aimed at deterring China’s economic coercion of governments is not only more consequential but also does not necessitate preventing firms from acquiescing to Beijing’s demands to be successful. Instead, the objective should be to prevent targeted firms from swaying the targeted government’s position in a direction contrary to U.S. interests — a seemingly trivial but important distinction. That said, China’s targeting of firms for their own perceived transgressions is a common occurrence and, though not the subject of this study, it carries its own different set of costs and is deserving of attention.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;case-study-summaries&quot;&gt;Case Study Summaries&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are brief summaries of the eight case studies examined in this study, in chronological order of the start of each incident. A more complete description of the incidents and their resolutions can be found in the annex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAPAN: FISHING BOAT CAPTAIN ARREST (2010)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2010, a Chinese fishing boat crew was detained by Japan’s Coast Guard and its captain arrested following a chase near the contested Senkaku/Diaoyu Island chain in the East China Sea. After releasing the rest of the crew, Tokyo threatened to indict the captain over his belligerent post-detainment behavior, which challenged agreed protocols between Japan and China over Senkaku-related issues. China implemented a diplomatic freeze, canceled tourism to Japan, and tightened inspections on Japanese imports. China also reportedly began blocking exports of rare earth minerals to Japan. Notably, China had announced in July 2010 that it would curb global exports of rare earths. Four Japanese nationals were also arrested in China, though Tokyo denied that the cases were related. Japan released the captain without charging him. China demanded an official apology, which never came, but lifted the rare earths export ban shortly after. In the wake of the incident, Japan commenced efforts to diversify its rare earths supply chain. Today, the islands remain a source of contention between Japan and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NORWAY: LIU XIAOBO NOBEL PRIZE (2010)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2010, the Oslo-based Nobel Peace Prize committee, composed of five members appointed by Norway’s parliament, selected imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo as the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Seeking to preempt Chinese anger, Norway emphasized the Nobel committee’s independence. Before the Nobel ceremony, China sent letters to foreign dignitaries asking they not attend. China also expressed opposition to the committee’s decision and instituted a diplomatic freeze against Norway, including ceasing free trade talks and blocking the issuance of visas to officials. Afterwards, Norwegian salmon imports to China fell drastically, and Norway was excluded from a program of visa-free travel to Beijing available to all 27 EU members plus Switzerland and Iceland. Salmon exports were largely rerouted through third countries like Vietnam. Relations were normalized in 2016, with China lifting its diplomatic freeze, salmon restrictions, and most other measures. The two countries resumed free trade talks in 2018, but the talks have stalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHILIPPINES: SCARBOROUGH SHOAL (2012)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2012, Chinese and Philippine ships were entangled in a standoff over the Philippines’ attempted arrest of Chinese fishing crews near the contested Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. Manila called for international adjudication of the dispute, but Beijing refused. China began turning away shipments of Philippine bananas, leaving them to rot in port. The refusals, ostensibly related to a pest issue, were also extended to other fruits. China also cut off tourist flows to the Philippines. While an agreement was soon brokered to de-escalate tensions near the shoal, China’s ships did not leave the area. Manila filed suit with the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague. China responded with an import ban on pineapples and bananas, a diplomatic freeze, an enhanced travel advisory, and a fishing ban near the shoal. In 2016 the Hague ruled in the Philippines’ favor, but China rejected the decision. Manila was unable to rally support from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the Philippine president opted not to press the matter. Relations warmed in 2016, though Chinese-promised investments in the Philippines never materialized. The current Philippine president has voiced stronger opposition to China’s South China Sea status and has increased ties with the United States, but he has also shown interest in boosting bilateral economic engagement with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOUTH KOREA: THAAD DEPLOYMENT (2016)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2016, South Korea and the United States announced a plan to install THAAD in South Korea. The purpose of the missile defense system was to guard against the North Korean threat, but China expressed concerns about the system’s potential impact on Chinese national security. Chinese media called for the use of economic measures against Korea, including boycotts of Korean manufacturers Hyundai and Kia. China curbed South Korean cultural exports and reduced tourism. The THAAD batteries were ultimately installed in April 2017 on land procured by the Korean government from Korean conglomerate Lotte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China responded by forcibly closing almost all Lotte stores in China over alleged fire code violations, issuing enhanced travel advisories, halting subsidies for electric vehicles powered by Korean-produced batteries, and restricting commodity imports. Seoul responded by working to boost trade ties with ASEAN and India and by supporting its affected industries and encouraging reshoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relations were normalized following Korea’s October 2017 announcement of the Three Nos: no additional THAAD deployment, no participation in the U.S. missile defense network, and no trilateral alliance with the United States and Japan. The current Korean president campaigned on a harder stance toward China and has downplayed the Three Nos policy, while also working to expand Korea’s trade ties with ASEAN and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MONGOLIA: DALAI LAMA VISIT (2016)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2016, the Dalai Lama visited Mongolia and indicated that a Buddhist patriarchal reincarnation had occurred there. China strongly opposes any visits by the Dalai Lama to foreign countries and maintains a strict system overseeing Buddhist reincarnation matters. Ahead of the 2016 visit, China warned Mongolia not to allow the Dalai Lama a visa. After the visit, China ceased talks covering soft loan negotiations, infrastructure investments, and a debt repayment loan. China also instituted fees and transit costs on commodity shipments at a major border crossing, leading to massive delays. Mongolia soon expressed regret over the situation and indicated it would not invite the Dalai Lama back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUSTRALIA: ANTI–FOREIGN INTERFERENCE LAW/CALL FOR COVID-19 INVESTIGATION (2017/2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, legislation was introduced in the Australian parliament to combat foreign interference in Australian politics. In announcing the legislation and indicating that it was aimed at China, former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull used a famous Mao Zedong saying: “The Chinese people have stood up.” Following complaints from the Chinese government, he repeated it two days later in Mandarin. Beijing responded with a diplomatic freeze, along with reported trade restrictions against Australian beef and wine. Australia-China relations subsequently deteriorated further, with China responding with various trade and diplomatic measures over Canberra’s 2018 blocking of Huawei from domestic 5G infrastructure, the filing of a 2020 World Trade Organization (WTO) antidumping case, and a public call for an independent investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 virus in 2020. China’s measures have included import suspensions or delays of a swath of Australian products, including beef, barley, cotton, wine, timber, lobster, and coal. A list of 14 grievances that Beijing provided Canberra was also leaked in late 2020. The diplomatic freeze ended in November 2022, but trade tensions remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANADA: MENG WANZHOU EXTRADITION (2018)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2018, Huawei chief financial officer (CFO) Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada over a U.S. warrant related to charges of Huawei’s alleged efforts to evade Iran sanctions. The arrest prompted a strong response from Beijing, which detained two Canadian citizens; summoned Canada’s ambassador to China; issued enhanced travel advisories covering Canada; and introduced delays and import curbs on Canadian peas, soybeans, pork, and beef. China also revoked the import licenses of two leading Canadian canola exporters. In response, Canada enhanced its travel advisory covering China, launched a campaign to bring attention to the detention of its citizens, and provided support to its domestic industries. The situation was eventually resolved in 2021 when the two countries swapped prisoners. China also lifted its canola restrictions in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LITHUANIA: TAIWANESE REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE (2021)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2021, Taiwan announced that it would open a Taiwanese Representative Office (TRO) in Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius. Including Taiwan, instead of Taipei, in the name of the office challenged an established norm imposed by Beijing for relations with Taiwan. Lithuania had also recently challenged China in several ways, including withdrawing from the so-called 17+1 initiative. Between the TRO’s announcement and opening, China ceased providing permits for Lithuanian food imports, cut off freight to Lithuania from state-owned company CRCT (though Chinese state media denied that an order had been relayed), and pressured foreign investors operating in Lithuania to lobby against Vilnius’ plan. Lithuanian firms also reported having trouble renewing and closing contracts in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the TRO’s opening, China downgraded diplomatic relations with Lithuania and effectively instituted an embargo. Lithuania’s export-oriented laser industry was especially exposed, and its companies lost market share to competitors from Germany, France, and the Netherlands. In addition, some German firms that sourced components from Lithuania reportedly had their exports to China blocked. The European Union requested consultations at the WTO, and China soon instituted official bans on Lithuanian beef, milk, and beer. EU views toward China have hardened due to the dispute, and Lithuania-Taiwan relations have grown stronger. The European Union has also fast-tracked its anti-coercion instrument (see Box 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-2-eu-anti-coercion-instrument&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 2. EU Anti-coercion Instrument&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The European Commission released the European Union’s proposed anti-coercion instrument (ACI) in December 2021. It aims to deter third-party coercive economic measures leveled against EU member states. To do so, the ACI would authorize the commission to retaliate with a set of punitive economic tools. Potential retaliatory measures include, but are not limited to, restrictions on exports, imports, financial market access, and intellectual property protections, as well as possible increased tariffs and new quotas.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Under the negotiating position of the EU Council that was released in November 2022, the ACI currently stands as follows: The commission first determines whether a member state is experiencing economic coercion based on the legal definition set out in the proposal. The council then affirms the commission’s determination by qualified majority voting. If the council agrees with the commission’s determination, the commission proposes a set of proportional retaliatory measures, which the council votes on for adoption by qualified majority. Throughout the process, the commission must seek or remain open to negotiation with the coercing country. The countermeasures remain in place until the coercion ceases.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The EU Council’s negotiating position represents a dilution of the commission’s power as laid out under the first version of the ACI proposal, which would have granted Brussels authority to unilaterally determine whether coercion is occurring and unilaterally implement countermeasures. The revisions come after some member states expressed concerns that too much centralization in Brussels creates a moral hazard whereby smaller member states less exposed to China’s market may be incentivized to take overly antagonistic positions vis-à-vis Beijing. Supporters of the commission’s position fear that diluting the power of the commission will erode the deterrent effect of the instrument. The EU parliament and the council now must come to an agreement on the ACI before it is implemented through the normal legislative process&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;case-study-key-takeaways-characteristics-of-chinese-coercion&quot;&gt;Case Study Key Takeaways: Characteristics of Chinese Coercion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While each instance of China’s economic coercion is unique, there are certain distinct patterns that emerge across the cases studied:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s use of economic coercion is typically triggered by challenges or threats to territorial integrity, domestic political legitimacy, national security, economic security, and PRC citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beijing’s coercive economic measures are almost always deployed informally and are often accompanied by noneconomic measures, including diplomatic freezes and military posturing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China typically employs economic coercion against smaller economies and in sectors where it possesses an asymmetric advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, China’s economic coercion does not impose significant macroeconomic costs on the targeted countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout and between coercive campaigns, Beijing will often adapt, repurpose, and even withdraw coercive measures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consistent with the academic literature on economic sanctions, China’s economic coercion has generally proven unsuccessful. Where it has led to concessions, Beijing’s tactical success is often accompanied with strategic setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion of each of these characteristics follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIVE TYPES OF TRIGGERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government typically deploys economic coercion in response to perceived provocations rather than direct harm. These triggering events typically fit within one or more of five overlapping categories of perceived challenges or threats: threats to territorial integrity, threats to domestic political legitimacy, threats to national security, threats to economic security, and threats to PRC citizens (Table 1). For example, Japan’s detainment of a Chinese fishing boat captain after a collision with a Japanese coast guard vessel in the contested Senkaku Islands both challenged a Chinese territorial claim and, from Beijing’s perspective, threatened a PRC citizen. Beijing perceived both Norway and Australia as actively undermining the CCP’s political legitimacy when the Oslo-based Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo the Nobel Peace Prize and when Prime Minister Turnbull used what Beijing perceived as inflammatory language in paraphrasing Mao when justifying the anti–foreign interference bill targeting China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Beijing perceived another Australian challenge to its legitimacy in 2020 when Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for an investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 virus. Beijing viewed South Korea’s deployment of THAAD, equipped with radar systems capable of peering into the Chinese mainland, as a threat to its national security. Further, China perceived the arrest of Meng in Vancouver not only as an attack on an important PRC citizen but also part of a larger attack on a national champion critical to China’s economic security, Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/N4HMPsK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1. Triggers and Relevant Cases of Chinese Coercion.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violation of one or more identified triggers is not necessarily sufficient to trigger a coercive response. In fact, many challenges go unmet with coercion from Beijing. Although outside the scope of this report, Ketian Zhang makes the case that this variation in response comes down to a cost-benefit analysis on the part of Beijing. China weighs the trade-off between the need to demonstrate resolve and the economic and geopolitical costs of coercion. In cases where the need to establish resolve on an issue of national interest is high and the economic costs are low, China is most likely to use coercion. When the risk of geopolitical backlash to coercion is high, Beijing prefers to use nonmilitary tools such as economic coercion. This helps explain why, though China’s military has become stronger and more capable over time, China’s use of military coercion has declined while its use of economic coercion has become more frequent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INFORMALITY OF IMPLEMENTATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although China has in recent years begun to develop more formal coercive tools, Beijing has demonstrated a preference for exercising its economic coercion through informal channels. China relies primarily on administrative tools, as well as its influence over domestic state-owned enterprises (SOEs), media, and public opinion. Consequently, its economic coercion is frequently carried out through plausibly deniable means such as the selective enforcement of regulations by customs officials, informal notices to commercial actors encouraging them to undertake particular courses of action, tourism advisories, state-promoted boycotts of foreign corporations, or nationalistic threats from state media outlets such as the Global Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An informal approach to economic coercion carries several advantages. It allows China to take rapid action while retaining an element of ambiguity in its methods and intentions. The plausible deniability afforded by informal measures also allows China to avoid legal challenges, mitigate diplomatic costs, and quickly recalibrate should its coercive measures prove ineffective or too costly. Informality complicates the response of the targeted state, as it can be difficult in legal terms to distinguish state-sanctioned informal coercion from market forces and legitimate policy concerns. This frustrates states that seek recourse through the WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism, which has proven largely inadequate in addressing economic coercion. Advantages aside, it may also be the case that China simply lacks the formal regulatory mechanisms through which to implement its coercive measures, leaving it to rely on informal means. (See discussion below of Beijing’s recent development of more formal tools.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the benefits afforded by an informal approach, informality also has its disadvantages. Most acute is that informality exacerbates the already difficult problems of implementation and enforcement of sanctions. With no clear legal authority or regulatory prohibition, opportunistic firms, or those with the right connections, may decide to ignore or circumvent Beijing’s dictates, diluting the effect of China’s economic coercion. For example, Lithuanian laser firms reported that orders of equipment needed for scientific work were still being placed by major Chinese universities. A related problem is that without formal processes to justify its policies, China’s informal sanctions lack the imprimatur of legitimacy that formal measures carry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The informality of China’s approach is present across all of the cases explored above. After Canadian authorities arrested Meng, Beijing justified its restriction and enhanced inspections of Canadian canola imports on the detection of pests, while the trade restrictions placed on Norwegian salmon and Philippine bananas were likewise justified on sanitary and phytosanitary grounds. In the 2012 Japanese rare earths case, China appeared to place an unofficial embargo on rare earths exports to Japan just one day after Japanese prosecutors announced their intention to prosecute a Chinese fishing boat captain. While officials in Beijing flatly denied the existence of an embargo, flows of rare earth materials to Japan reportedly resumed five days after the captain’s release. Likewise, when the TRO opened in Vilnius, Lithuania simply disappeared as an option in China’s customs database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although China tries to maintain an element of plausible deniability in its implementation of coercive economic measures, Beijing will often obliquely link its coercive policies to the perceived offense. In cases where the offending policy decision was telegraphed beforehand, such as in Mongolia, Lithuania, Norway, and Japan, Beijing warned that taking the action in question would harm relations. Likewise, in some cases, China will communicate to the targeted country what it could do to normalize relations, as in the case of the 14 grievances with Australia and after Canada’s arrest of Meng, when Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested that releasing Meng would help resolve “the situation of the two Canadians.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Beijing has unveiled a number of formal economic coercion instruments. These include the Chinese Ministry of Commerce’s (MOFCOM) 2019 announcement of an unreliable entities list, mirroring the U.S. entity list; a unified export control law passed by the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) in October 2020; foreign sanctions blocking rules issued by MOFCOM in January 2021; and a more comprehensive Anti-foreign Sanctions Law passed by NPCSC in June 2021. While Beijing has thus far largely refrained from deploying its new economic coercion instruments, their existence threatens to put multinational corporations with a footprint in China in a legal bind that could raise the perceived cost of additional sanctions targeting China. They may also signal China’s desire to bring more formality to its economic statecraft. In January 2023, MOFCOM and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) reportedly began “seeking public comment on adding some manufacturing methods key to producing advanced solar wafers on to its list of technologies it prohibits exporting,” indicating that Beijing may be edging closer to using its formal instruments, at least in a defensive manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEPLOYMENT OF NONECONOMIC COERCIVE MEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing often deploys a portfolio of various noneconomic coercive techniques, both symmetric and asymmetric, in its efforts to pressure target countries. Among these are hostage diplomacy, nonviolent military/paramilitary coercion, diplomatic sanctions, and cyberattacks (Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hostage Diplomacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has demonstrated a troubling pattern across several cases of mixing economic coercion with hostage diplomacy. In addition to restricting Canadian agricultural imports, China detained Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig shortly after the arrest of Meng and released them nearly three years later only after the Huawei CFO obtained permission to return to China. Likewise, after detaining the fishing boat captain, Japan not only found its rare earth imports curtailed but also saw four Japanese businessmen barred from returning to Japan until Beijing deemed the issue resolved with the captain’s release. More recently, in the case of Lithuania, some have speculated that Beijing timed its reaction to the opening of the TRO in Vilnius with the return of the Lithuanian ambassador to Beijing. The ambassador then underwent a weeks-long Covid-19 quarantine that carried the implicit threat of further detention. Over the course of its years-long dispute with Canberra, Beijing detained two Australian citizens on suspicious grounds and upgraded the sentence of an Australian citizen imprisoned for drug trafficking to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nonviolent Military/Paramilitary Coercion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also flexed its military might alongside its economic power. During the 2012 dispute with the Philippines over the Scarborough Shoal, Beijing dispatched Chinese maritime surveillance ships as well as an armed coast guard vessel to the disputed waters while simultaneously blocking Philippine banana exports to China on sanitary grounds. After Japan detained the Chinese fishing boat captain, Beijing increased the number of Chinese maritime law enforcement patrols in the vicinity of the disputed Senkaku Islands. South Korea witnessed increased Chinese military aircraft incursions into its air identification zone as well as live fire drills and a Chinese missile weapons test in Bohai Sea after the deployment of THAAD. While not included in the case studies above, Beijing responded to U.S. house speaker Nancy Pelosi’s August 2022 visit to Taiwan with both import bans on agriculture products and unprecedented military exercises in the waters surrounding Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diplomatic Sanctions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic coercion is often accompanied with some form of diplomatic sanction. In the case of Norway and Australia, this amounted to a complete diplomatic freeze. Lithuania saw its diplomatic status downgraded from ambassadorship to chargé d’affaires, and Beijing recalled its own ambassador from Vilnius. After the Dalai Lama visit, China postponed upcoming bilateral meetings with Mongolia, and in the Senkakus dispute with Japan, China first suspended East China Sea oil and gas negotiations and then canceled parliamentary exchanges before suspending bilateral exchanges altogether. During the dispute over the Scarborough Shoal, China canceled high-level bilateral visits and held no formal meetings with the Philippine foreign ministry between 2013 and 2015. China also reportedly recalled its invitation to Philippine president Benigno Aquino for the China-ASEAN trade fair. In addition, Beijing canceled high-level meetings with South Korean officials, including the defense minister, following the 2016 THAAD deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberattacks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks have been another coercive tool deployed by Beijing alongside economic coercion. In the months following the opening of the TRO, Lithuanian intelligence reported, “China is increasingly using its cyber capabilities against Lithuania.” In the Scarborough Shoal dispute, Chinese hackers defaced the websites of the University of the Philippines, the Department of Budget and Management, and the Philippine News Agency. Just three weeks after awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Committee’s website was hit with a cyberattack. In the years that followed the decision, Norway was also targeted more frequently by cyberattacks originating in China than its Nordic neighbors; however, it is unclear how much of that was the result of the Nobel Peace Prize decision. South Korea and Canada likewise saw upticks in cyberattacks following the former’s decision to permit the deployment of THAAD and the latter’s arrest of Meng.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gluxONm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 2. Tools and Relevant Cases of Noneconomic Coercion.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PREFERENCE FOR TARGETING RELATIVELY SMALL ECONOMIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the cases surveyed, China displays a preference for using economic coercion against relatively small economies. With the exception of Japan, no coerced country’s gross domestic product (GDP) exceeds 15 percent of China’s, while two of the countries — Mongolia and Lithuania — do not even amount to 1 percent of China’s GDP combined (Table 3). China’s preference for targeting smaller countries is likely a consequence of several factors. The targeting of smaller countries helps ensure the secondary impact of China’s measures on its own industries is limited. In addition, smaller countries are often more vulnerable to Beijing’s measures, as trade accounts for a greater share of their GDP. Finally, from a deterrence and credibility perspective, it is more important that China demonstrates resolve in disputes with small countries so as to not appear weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8iLfKR1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 3. Size of Targeted Economies Relative to China.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators&quot;&gt;“World Development Indicators,” World Bank&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s targeting of Japan is a notable deviation from the pattern demonstrated across the other seven cases. However, there are several possible explanations for why China would turn its coercive measures on Japan, despite the size of its economy. First, the atrocities committed by Japan’s military regime against China during World War II makes Sino-Japanese relations uniquely sensitive. When Japan, from Beijing’s perspective, challenged a Chinese territorial claim and mistreated PRC citizens, China could not be seen to back down or would risk domestic nationalist backlash. Therefore, the need for resolve was high. At the same time, Japan was highly dependent on Chinese rare earth exports, which China was already looking to curtail for economic, strategic, and environmental purposes unrelated to the Senkakus dispute. Therefore, the economic cost of curtailing rare earth exports to Japan was to some degree already factored into Chinese policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that China has shown a particular aversion to targeting the United States with its economic coercion. The United States has on numerous occasions taken actions that could have triggered a coercive response from Beijing, but instead the response was weak, nonexistent, or aimed at a smaller ally or partner of the United States. For example, when Pelosi traveled to Taiwan to demonstrate Congress’s support for the island and its democracy, it was Taiwan, not the United States, that bore the brunt of China’s coercive measures. China’s sole direct response to the United States was limited to canceling channels of engagement on issues like climate and counternarcotics trade. Even other large economies, like France, have faced higher costs than the United States for similar actions Beijing perceives as an offense. For example, in 1992, the PRC government closed the French consulate and French Trade Commission in Guangzhou and excluded French firms from contract bidding in response to the French transfer of frigates to Taiwan. In that same span of time, Beijing appeared to have restrained itself from taking similar actions toward the United States despite the latter’s more frequent and expansive history of defense transfers to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is the 2019 addition of Huawei to the U.S. Department of Commerce entity list under the administration of U.S. president Donald J. Trump. The move directly challenged the core business operations of the Chinese telecoms giant, and while Beijing condemned the listing, it did not retaliate against the United States directly. Instead, China threatened coercion against foreign companies (not just those based in the United States) by announcing a notional unreliable entities list, analogous to the U.S. entity list. Likewise, Beijing’s response to the recent spate of export controls that the administration of U.S. president Joe Biden has placed on semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment has been similarly muted — though the aforementioned recent reporting suggests China may be considering retaliating against the United States by placing export restrictions on solar technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TARGETED AT POLITICALLY INFLUENTIAL OR SYMBOLIC INDUSTRIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing appears to target industries as much for their political importance as for their economic impact. By targeting industries with influential lobbies, Beijing aims to put political pressure on the target, increasing the likelihood of acquiescence to Beijing’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Philippines, China targeted Philippine banana exporters through inspection delays and suspensions. For the Philippines, bananas are a strategic export, and banana farmers, largely based on the southern island of Mindanao, wield significant political influence. The import suspensions threatened farmers’ livelihoods by interrupting strict business cycles. The banana lobby urged the Philippines government to appease Beijing in order to alleviate the situation. By putting economic pressure on influential industries, Beijing translates its economic leverage into domestic political pressure in the target country. Even if the economic impact of a coercive measure can be weathered by a target country, it may be more difficult for that country to withstand the increased domestic political pressure from powerful interest groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Lithuania, the Chinese government pivoted to targeting German firms in an effort to exert greater political pressure on Vilnius to acquiesce. Meanwhile, Norway found its globally prominent farmed salmon industry in China’s crosshairs. Australia’s wine industry, one of the largest in the world, was hit with tariffs of over 200 percent, losing access to its most lucrative market in China. Wine grapes are grown across Australia, and Australia’s powerful agriculture lobby represents their growers. In general, agriculture and commodities lobbies are politically influential. In addition to the Philippines, Norway, and Australia, China targeted agricultural products and commodities in Canada, Mongolia, Australia, and Lithuania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INSIGNIFICANT COST AT THE MACROECONOMIC LEVEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its size advantage, China so far has proven unwilling — or possibly unable — to impose significant economy-wide costs on the targeted country. That is not to say that China’s economic coercion has not imposed any costs. It has been costly for targeted firms such as South Korea’s Lotte, which suffered an estimated $1.78 billion in damages due to China’s coercive actions. The reduction in Chinese tourist visits also hit Korea’s tourism sector particularly hard, with some estimates placing the cost as high as $15.6 billion, as fewer Chinese tourists spent money shopping, dining, and lodging in South Korean establishments. However, there is reason to believe this estimate is overstated, as the underlying study fails to account for potential increases in non-Chinese tourism. For example, another study found that although arrivals of Chinese tourists to Jeju Island declined by 46 percent in March 2017, an influx of domestic tourists led to an increase in the total number of tourists visiting Jeju for that month. In addition, the Bank of Korea estimated South Korea’s GDP growth was just 0.4 percent less than it would have been absent China’s coercive economic measures. For context, the sanctions literature points to 2 percent of gross national product (GNP) as the threshold cost for sanctions to begin to have effect on the target. The U.S.-led multilateral sanctions regime that brought Iran to the negotiating table during the administration under U.S. president Barack Obama cut Iran’s GDP by 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s import restrictions have also led to decreases in trade in the targeted sectors between China and the targeted state. For example, the value of Canada’s exports to China declined $4 billion in 2019. Australia’s exports to China also decreased by approximately $4 billion dollars in the targeted sectors in the year following the call by Canberra for an investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 virus. Likewise, Norway saw a reduction in total exports to China of between $780 million and $1.3 billion between 2011 and 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while these declines may be costly for the affected sectors, the costs represent only a fraction of each country’s total value of exports. For context, Canada’s total exports were valued at $447 billion in 2019, while Australia’s were valued at $245 billion in 2020. Norway’s total exports reached $160 billion in 2011. In addition, trade diversion helps further offset the macroeconomic costs of China’s economic coercion. Canadian canola found its way to China via the United Arab Emirates; Norwegian salmon made an additional stop in Vietnam; and Australian coal was rerouted to markets in India, Japan, and South Korea. In fact, the Australian Department of the Treasury estimated that Australian exporters offset the $4 billion decline in exports to China with an increase of $3.3 billion of exports to new markets. Thus, the net loss due to China’s coercion was just 0.25 percent of the value of Australian exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, China’s coercion also has had little impact on the overall bilateral structure of trade with the target country. What is surprising is that in some cases trade between China and the target country actually increased during the coercive campaign. For example, South Korean exports to China went up by approximately 14 percent in 2017 amid the dispute over the THAAD deployment. In addition, a $7 billion investment by Samsung in its Xi’an operations was allowed to go through unimpeded. Indeed, China largely avoided targeting Korea’s export of intermediate inputs, which account for approximately 70 percent of Korea’s exports to China. Likewise, the overall value of Australian exports to China increased by 10 percent following Australia’s call for an investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 virus, and Norwegian trade with China reached a historic high in 2015. As was the case with Samsung, China also did not block ChemChina’s $2 billion purchase of a Norwegian silicon producer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEPLOYED IN CASES OF ASYMMETRIC ADVANTAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing prefers to target sectors where it has both an asymmetric advantage in the structure of trade and in which protectionist measures can directly benefit domestic constituencies. At the time China cut off its rare earth exports to Japan in 2010, Japan depended on China for more than 90 percent of its rare earth imports. The move to curtail rare earth exports appeared to garner domestic political support in China, as it corresponded to state initiatives to limit production that had preceded the Senkakus incident as part of a broader rethink of the environmental, economic, and strategic benefits of a more disciplined export strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing also appears to settle on imports for which it can easily find substitutes. Although China depended on Canada for more than 90 percent of its canola imports, it managed to make up for its losses by increasing imports from Russia, Ukraine, and the United Arab Emirates, and by dipping into its strategic agricultural reserves. Beijing also may have hoped the embargo would spur increased domestic production of rapeseed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China tends to target commodities in which it enjoys relatively low import dependency and can access an abundance of global suppliers while avoiding escalation in areas where it relies heavily on a handful of trading partners. Here the contrast between Beijing’s treatment of Australian coal and iron ore is instructive. China occupies near-monopsony status for Australian exporters of iron ore, accounting for nearly 80 percent of all Australian export sales in 2021. But although Australia cannot afford to lose the Chinese market, Beijing appears reluctant to exploit this interdependency — perhaps aware of the risks to economic growth, especially in the critical downstream infrastructure and property sectors, that a sudden halt to iron ore imports could pose for China. The global iron ore market is dominated by a handful of large producers in Australia and Brazil, who collectively dwarf Chinese domestic supply. From 2016 to 2020, China’s import dependency on iron ore averaged a staggering 80 percent, with Australian imports accounting for well over half of the total. In 2021, even amid heightened trade tensions, Australia continued to supply over 60 percent of China’s overseas iron ore purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, from 2007 to 2019, China’s import dependency in coal consistently remained below 10 percent. Moreover, China produces by far the most coal of any country in the world, with ex-China supply divided up among a long tail of smaller producing countries, among which Australia is an important but not indispensable provider. Even during a period of spiking demand and energy rationing in late 2020, the Chinese government allegedly persisted in blocking large quantities of Australian coal from entering its ports. That Beijing refrained from meddling with shipments of Australian iron ore implies certain limits to the Chinese leadership’s risk tolerance in weaponizing its buying power. Even when it holds a dominant share of global demand for a particular commodity, China may avoid direct confrontation if it lacks sufficient flexibility to ensure continued access for itself — especially if the commodity in question is vital to its investment-centric economic model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2017 editorial in the Global Times made explicit the case for asymmetrical targeting, arguing in response to South Korea’s announcement of THAAD deployment: “To the greatest extent possible, sanctions towards Korea must identify the areas where [we] can deliver significant unilateral losses to Korea, or those where the particular scope of damage to Korea is disproportionately larger than damage to China.” This asymmetry was reflected in Chinese targeting of Lotte stores, for which Chinese alternatives on the mainland existed, and tourism, as Chinese tourists made up the largest number of foreign visitors to South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INNOVATION, ADAPTABILITY, AND RISK AVERSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China has increasingly turned to economic coercion, Chinese policymakers have shown a propensity to experiment, refining their coercive tools and applying the lessons learned from one coercion campaign to the next. As a result, China has developed an expansive repertoire of coercive measures, which are often used in various combinations to affect the same target (Table 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/m080OCK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 4. Tools and Relevant Cases of Chinese Economic Coercion.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has demonstrated risk aversion in its deployment of its coercive economic measures. Indeed, China’s preference for economic tools over military tools is in part driven by a desire to limit escalatory risk. Likewise, when selecting sectors to target, China will often choose sectors in which it has some prior experience of manipulating commercial flows. For instance, prior to the Meng case, China had restricted Canada’s canola exports in both 2009 and 2016. Similarly, Chinese inspection authorities first flagged Philippine banana exports for sanitary concerns in March 2012, a month before the Scarborough Shoal dispute began in earnest. Philippine officials noted that the timing of China’s import stoppage was well planned and was likely indicative of the use of a targeting “template.” In focusing its coercive measures on previously targeted imports and commodities, Beijing gravitates toward tactics that proved effective in the past at an acceptable domestic cost. There is also the added benefit of enhanced plausible deniability: Beijing can better distance its actions from the political dispute at hand by pointing to a track record of prior regulatory interventions against a given class of imported product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China avoids implementing coercive tools that are costly domestically. For example, despite Australia’s asymmetric dependence on China’s market for its iron ore exports, China did not put restrictions on this critical sector of the Australian economy as it would have proven extremely costly for Beijing as well. When the domestic costs of coercive policies grow too expensive, China has adapted by dialing back or abandoning coercive measures, as was the case when Beijing lifted restrictions on Canadian pork imports after African swine fever decimated China’s domestic swine herds. However, when its coercive economic policies fail to achieve their intended effect, China has also shown willingness to escalate, both vertically and horizontally, and to experiment with novel tactics. The ongoing dispute with Lithuania exemplifies both characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lead-up to the Lithuanian government’s decision to open a TRO in Vilnius, China had been slowly applying economic pressure, first by cutting off credit insurance for Lithuanian counterparts of Chinese firms and then by blocking timber and grain exports. After the offending office finally opened, China intensified the pressure by effectively cutting off all trade with Lithuania. However, China’s initial punitive measures exerted little economic pain owing to the minimal amount of direct trade between the two countries: Lithuania’s exports to China account for just 1 percent of its total exports, and its imports from China make up just 3 percent of total imports. Beijing adapted by threatening informal secondary sanctions — a novel tactic — on European, primarily German, firms that sourced products from Lithuanian suppliers. This tactic led some European voices to call for Lithuania to back down and prompted the Lithuanian president to express regret over the name choice. However, Vilnius ultimately held firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOME TACTICAL VICTORIES BUT FREQUENT STRATEGIC SETBACKS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithuania’s refusal to back down reveals a final characteristic of China’s economic coercion: its frequent ineffectiveness. The TRO in Vilnius still bears its name. Australia likewise remains defiant and has only more closely aligned its foreign policy with U.S. policy through the creation of AUKUS. Where countries have acquiesced to China’s demands, China’s tactical victories have proven ephemeral and often come with a strategic cost for China. South Korea’s current president, for example, has criticized the Three Nos policy that his predecessor used to distance himself from the United States and has promised to pursue a tougher line against China while continuing the former administration’s initiative to reduce Korea’s economic dependence on China. Japan continues efforts to reorient its rare earth supply chains away from China, while Canada’s government has blocked Huawei from entering its 5G networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mongolia and the Philippines represent two cases where China’s coercion achieved some mixed success. However, neither campaign was costless for Beijing. Even though Mongolia was facing an economic recession and is located precariously between Russia and China, it was not deterred by China’s initial threats of economic coercion and still allowed the Dalai Lama to visit. Likewise, although Mongolia quickly capitulated to Beijing’s demands after the visit, China’s coercive campaign seems to have contributed to the election of the more anti-China candidate in Mongolia’s 2017 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic coercion was arguably more successful against the Philippines, preventing the arrest of Chinese crew members and securing control of the Scarborough Shoal. However, China’s coercion prompted the Philippines to challenge China’s territorial claims at the Hague, which ruled against China, undermining the legitimacy of its activities in the South China Sea. More recently, the Philippines announced it would allow the U.S. military access to four additional bases, reflecting a balancing back toward the United States in the face of an increasingly assertive Beijing. In addition, the mixing of military and economic tools makes it difficult to tease out causality, a task made even more difficult by the radical foreign policy shift toward greater engagement with China initiated by then-president Duterte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 5 offers a summary assessment of Beijing’s success in advancing its tactical and strategic interests in the eight cases of coercion studied. A narrative explanation of these assessments is included in the annex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEATURES MAKING CHINESE COERCION LESS EFFECTIVE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The literature shows that sanctions, in general, tend to be ineffective regardless of the country of origin. Moreover, many of the elements that contribute to sanctions’ effectiveness are not present in China’s use of economic coercion. In fact, several features of Chinese coercion undermine its effectiveness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unilateral instead of Multilateral&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China deploys its economic coercion unilaterally. Without multilateral buy-in, markets eventually adjust, eroding the impact of China’s sanctions. In contrast, sanctions implemented multilaterally are more effective, as it makes it more difficult for the targeted state to find new markets, increases the magnitude and duration of the cost, and grants the sanctions greater legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Low Cost Imposed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although “there is no one-to-one correlation,” the greater the costs imposed by sanctions, the more likely they will be effective, especially if deployed against a weaker country. However, China’s economic coercion thus far has not imposed severe economy-wide costs on the target country — in part because of its unilateralism but also due to China’s own risk and cost aversions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Economic and Political Strength of Target&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China targets smaller countries, these countries are not necessarily weak. The majority of the countries surveyed for this report have healthy economies and political systems. The two exceptions, arguably, are Mongolia, which was facing a recession at the time of the Dalai Lama’s visit, and the Philippines, which suffers from systemic political corruption. These are also the two cases in which China’s economic coercion was most successful at achieving its policy goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Targeting of Adversaries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of China’s economic coercion is also likely muted by its propensity to target adversarial countries rather than friendly ones. Sanctions are typically less effective against the former than the latter. On the one hand, when aimed at adversaries, sanctions tend to entrench the targeted countries’ negative views of the sanctioning regime, strengthening resolve. On the other hand, friendly countries value maintaining their relationship with the sending country and, therefore, are more likely to acquiesce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Poor Signaling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The informal nature of China’s economic coercion complicates signaling. Coercion is most effective when demands are clearly linked to reasonable and limited goals. However, if China explicitly ties its coercion to a trigger, this could undermine its plausible deniability. The informality of China’s coercion also seems to complicate its deterrent effect, as China is unable to say explicitly what the punishment will be for a transgression, instead preferring to speak in generalities about the damage an unwanted act or policy will do to bilateral relations with the target state. To be sure, the opposite could also be argued, in that the ambiguity surrounding the triggers of economic coercion may make countries more cautious about violating China’s core interest. China also has proven consistent in ceasing its coercion when desired concessions are made. In fact, the lack of clear signaling about what those concessions are may give China more room to negotiate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lack of Adequate Inducements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coupling sanctions with inducements can increase their effectiveness. China has attempted to do this but not always with great effect. For example, in the Norway case study, it was arguably the opportunity to resume free trade negotiations with China that prompted Oslo to issue the apology rather than the import restrictions on salmon, which by that time were imposing little, if any, cost on Norway. Likewise, after then-president Duterte decided to pursue reconciliation with China, Beijing announced $24 billion in investments in the Philippines. However, Philippines-China relations soured again after much of this failed to materialize, while Norway-China trade negotiations have since broken down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY CHINA CONTINUES TO COERCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China’s use of economic coercion is often inimical to its own strategic interest, the question arises: Why does China continue to engage in this behavior? Economic coercion sends a signal of resolve, and for every country that chooses to maintain its course in the face of Chinese pressure, many others might quietly adjust their policies to remain in Beijing’s good graces. While the counterfactual cannot be known, the CCP may persist in using such techniques despite their seeming ineffectiveness, at least in part because it values their highly intangible deterrent effect. This too would help explain China’s preference for disproportionate, rather than measured, responses. An example must be made by “killing the chickens to scare the monkey,” to quote the Chinese idiom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While again recognizing the difficulty of quantifying the effects of deterrence, it is far from clear that China’s economic coercion is an effective deterrent. China certainly has success cases. Nineteen states declined to attend the 2010 Nobel ceremony at Beijing’s request, for example. Nevertheless, in several cases, states targeted by China’s economic coercion have continued to pursue policies that run contrary to Beijing’s interests. Australia, for example, banned Huawei from its 5G networks, called for an investigation into the origin of the Covid-19 virus, and joined AUKUS. Canada likewise banned Huawei from its networks. Several other countries followed suit. While there may be a general, if difficult to measure, perception that states avoid making statements about China’s human rights abuses in places such as Xinjiang and Hong Kong out of fear of China’s retribution, there is also a measurable decline in public opinion of China around the world — for which Beijing’s bullying behavior may be at least partially to blame and which hypothetically should make it politically easier for politicians to stand up to China, diluting the deterrent effect of its economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the unclear deterrent effect, China’s seemingly counterproductive use of economic coercion might also be understood through the logic of “appropriateness” rather than the logic of “consequence.” States, like individuals, act not just according to expected outcomes but also based on the values they hold, regardless of the consequences. China increasingly views itself as a major power and therefore feels it cannot abide slights or challenges from lesser powers. In Beijing’s view, such provocations demand a response. The logic-of-appropriateness framework, in combination with China’s risk aversion, also helps explain Beijing’s preference for targeting small countries: just as small states are less likely to escalate, insubordination from small states is more intolerable to self-defined great powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with Chinese president Xi Jinping’s centralization of power, China has become more nationalistic. Its leaders have become even more sensitive to challenges to CCP legitimacy. The triggers of China’s economic coercion all relate to the party’s declared core interests. In a more nationalistic domestic political environment, failure to respond with sufficient force could challenge the careers of individual officials as well as the CCP’s domestic legitimacy. Therefore, although China’s use of economic coercion may impede its foreign policy objectives, to the extent that it also enhances the regime’s domestic legitimacy, Beijing may consider the diplomatic costs manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Beijing’s use of economic coercion is likely to continue. Through its dual circulation strategy, the CCP hopes to enhance China’s position in the global economy, deepen its resilience to external shocks, and gain economic leverage over its trading partners by reshaping global supply chains and boosting domestic consumption. At the same time, Chinese political rhetoric has steadily grown more nationalistic. Bolstered by the ever-improving capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), and with major political anniversaries looming, the party’s sensitivity to challenges to its core interests — especially its one-China principle — will likely increase. If China’s power continues expanding, Beijing will find it even less appropriate to tolerate slights from other smaller states. Assuming geopolitical tensions between the United States and China continue apace, a risk-averse Beijing will likely continue to prefer economic tools to more escalatory military ones in its efforts to coerce other states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China’s use of economic coercion is likely to proliferate in tandem with its economic power, how might its approaches to coercion evolve? First, Beijing may seek to expand its still-limited arsenal of formal coercion instruments, such as the Unreliable Entity List and Anti-foreign Sanctions Law. So far, the effect of such tools has been largely symbolic, with China’s leaders seemingly reluctant to antagonize foreign companies at scale — but this could change. While this greater degree of formalization could hinder China’s ability to adapt to changing circumstances and constrain its attempts to project ambiguity, increased use of formal measures could also complement informal pressures in ways that amplify the deterrent effect of China’s coercion tactics. Formality might also enhance enforcement and provide China’s coercive measures with greater legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing is also likely to continue to use economic coercion in conjunction with noneconomic tools, as shown in the PLA’s ramped-up exercises in the waters around Taiwan following Speaker Pelosi’s visit. Further, China may grow more comfortable in challenging the policies of larger countries, as shown by its de facto secondary sanctions against German companies in the case of Lithuania. The dual circulation framework indicates that China will likely continue to seek out sectors of target economies of high political salience where China enjoys an asymmetric advantage and can readily find substitute sources of supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-3-a-study-in-contrasts-us-versus-chinese-approaches-to-economic-coercion&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 3. A Study in Contrasts: U.S. versus Chinese Approaches to Economic Coercion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As the world’s largest economy and holder of the world’s reserve currency, the United States practices economic coercion. However, the United States’ coercive conduct differs from China’s in many important ways.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Unlike China, the United States conducts its coercive economic policies through formal legal instruments that typically allow for some form of judicial review. For example, policy guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) allows, under certain circumstances, sanctioned persons whose assets have been frozen to access a portion of those blocked funds to cover their sanctions-related legal fees. Whether economic coercion methods are initiated via executive order, the executive branch’s multistep rulemaking process, or congressional action, the U.S. government tends to publicly cite a legal basis and policy rationale, name the affected parties, and offer some form of written guidance for compliance.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the post-9/11 era, the United States has used financial sanctions as its coercive tool of choice, reflecting its centrality in the international monetary system. This contrasts with China’s preference for restricting access to its large domestic market, reflecting its comparative advantage in the global economy. Where China’s coercion has largely targeted democratic countries and private firms in response to perceived violations of China’s core interests, the United States primarily targets authoritarian governments, state sponsors of terrorism, and individuals and groups involved in criminal activity or human rights abuses. Also unlike China, which acts unilaterally, the United States prefers to act in concert with allies and partners. A recent example is the multilateral sanctions package levied on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. However, it is important not to gloss over the tensions U.S. economic coercion can create between the United States and its allies and the fact that the United States will act unilaterally at times.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Even before the Trump administration launched a trade war against the European Union when the United States placed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, U.S. allies and partners were the target of U.S. economic coercion, primarily via U.S. secondary sanctions. These controversial sanctions target foreign entities that transact with the original subject of a U.S. sanction in an effort to coerce multilateral cooperation and enhance the economic effect of the primary sanction. Secondary sanctions differ from other types of U.S. economic coercion, not only in their targets but also in that they are designed to have a deterrent effect rather than punish or obtain a change in the target’s behavior, which is the primary object in most instances of U.S. economic coercion. Although President Biden has sought to reemphasize allied cooperation after the unilateralism of the Trump years, with some notable successes, his administration has nevertheless demonstrated a willingness to act alone. The recent sweeping set of export controls blocking the sale of advanced semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China are a notable example.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The export controls on semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment from October 7, 2022, also highlight the increasing centrality of export controls in U.S. economic coercion. The Trump administration made use of export controls to target China’s techno-industrial base, starting with telecom giants Huawei and ZTE, before eventually deploying them against hundreds of firms with alleged ties to the Chinese military. The Biden administration has systematized and expanded the use of this tactic, with national security adviser Jake Sullivan arguing, “Technology export controls . . . can be a new strategic asset in the U.S. and allied tool kit.” His remarks followed the Biden administration’s use of export controls to deprive the Russian military of technologies and components needed to sustain military operations and previewed the more aggressive turn the administration was about to take against Beijing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In contrast to the United States, China has rarely used export restrictions in its coercive campaigns. The curtailment of rare earth exports to Japan and, to a lesser extent, the trade embargo of Lithuania are notable exceptions. The United States, thanks to its central position in high-tech supply chains, can also make use of the foreign-direct product rule (FDPR) to strengthen the effectiveness of its export controls. Much like secondary sanctions, the FDPR allows the United States to coerce multilateral cooperation by threatening to sanction exporters of products that contain U.S. technology or components.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As the world’s two largest economies, both the United States and China leverage their economic power to advance strategic goals and defend their national interests. However, there are important differences between why and how these two countries use economic coercion. These differences reflect not only the two countries’ differing comparative economic advantages, but also their different values and the United States’ access to a strong network of allies. In sum, U.S. economic coercion is more transparent, is grounded in domestic law, and often strives for multilateral implementation, even if that multilateralism requires coercion.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-a-counterstrategy&quot;&gt;Toward a Counterstrategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has publicly stated a desire to “identify and address economic coercion.” According to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the United States seeks a future where “countries are secure from coercion and aggression” and work to “stand together with others against economic coercion and intimidation.” U.S. ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel has been a leading voice in the administration on this issue. Commenting for this study, Ambassador Emanuel offered these thoughts on countering China’s coercion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China is increasingly deploying its economic muscle on behalf of political objectives, and there are no signs it will abandon economic coercion as a tool of statecraft. The evidence is clear. The policy tools vary. The current international response is lacking. Our policy toolkit needs updating. Clarifying authorities to support foreign partners will help us win this battle. By working with a coalition to support victims quickly, we show the value of a rules-based order and U.S. leadership. Economic coercion requires a collective response, and the coalition must be led by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress too has taken an interest in the issue. In the last Congress, legislation was introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate directing the White House to create an interagency task force dedicated to countering China’s economic coercion. This language was also included in the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, which will establish a task force led by the National Security Council. The new Congress has also seen legislation addressing China’s economic coercion reintroduced. Drawing on the lessons from the case studies in part one, this report contributes to the emerging policy debate on how best to counter China’s economic coercion by putting forward a counterstrategy for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-economic-coercion-and-us-interests&quot;&gt;China’s Economic Coercion and U.S. Interests&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any strategy to counter Chinese economic coercion must begin with a clear articulation of how China’s coercion impacts U.S. interests. While it is generally assumed China’s coercive actions run contrary to U.S. interests, a closer examination reveals a more complex relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s coercion challenges the rules-based international economic system that has allowed the United States, its allies and partners, and China itself to prosper in the post–Cold War era. China’s economic coercion can also divide U.S. allies and partners as firms in friendly countries often stand to benefit commercially from the economic pain inflicted on the targeted country. While it is difficult to know how powerful the deterrent effect is, fear of economic retaliation may make it more difficult for the United States to build coalitions that push back against China’s human rights abuses and territorial violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterintuitively, China’s use of economic coercion also intersects with U.S. interests. As China gains strength, its use of that strength to coerce smaller countries has harmed its global image. In addition, a new consensus in Washington has emerged regarding economic relations with China. During the Trump administration, decoupling in strategic sectors was controversial, but under the Biden administration, targeted decoupling has been formalized, systematized, and expanded. There is now strong bipartisan consensus that at least some decoupling from China is in the interest of the United States, with the debate shifting to how much and how best to achieve that. China’s use of coercion drives decoupling as countries and firms rethink their dependency on the Chinese market and seek to mitigate risk in the face of Beijing’s capricious and arbitrary behavior. Although there are limits to how much noneconomic diversification market forces will bear, China is at least in part playing “bad cop” with its coercive measures, pushing firms and U.S. allies to diversify without the U.S. government having to expend political and diplomatic capital. Further, as this report assesses, China’s economic coercion has a mixed record of achieving its tactical aims; even when successful tactically, it often harms China’s strategic interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic coercion, then, works both for and against U.S. interests. All else equal, Beijing’s bullying might enhance the image of the United States vis-à-vis China. However, China’s coercion is costly for targeted firms and sectors, and its use can deter allies and partners in ways that violate U.S. interests. In addition, while China’s economic coercion may create the perception that China is an unreliable economic partner, such behavior has not been sufficient to spur the level of supply chain adjustments and sensitive technology export limits deemed necessary to protect U.S. national security, in part because China forgoes targeting the critical technologies it needs in its coercive campaigns. Indeed, given the size and importance of China’s market, it is not feasible nor advisable for states to eliminate every economic dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China will remain enmeshed in the international economic order for the foreseeable future. Economic coexistence is necessary. The United States should therefore not tolerate China’s use of economic coercion. Nevertheless, a comprehensive counterstrategy should account for the ways that Chinese coercion can, at times, align with U.S. interests. In short, it should increase the costs for China due to its own self-defeating behavior while mitigating the harm to U.S. allies and partners and international norms and rules. A counterstrategy can achieve this by accomplishing the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reduce the economic and political pressure China’s economic coercion places on U.S. allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the extent possible, accelerate the hardening and decoupling of allies’ and partners’ sectors and supply chains, especially in critical technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Highlight U.S. efforts to assist targeted nations and draw attention to China’s problematic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strategy based on the concept of deterrence by denial is best suited to achieve these objectives and, in doing so, deter future acts of economic coercion by China. Unlike deterrence by punishment, which threatens to inflict penalties, deterrence by denial makes an action infeasible by decreasing its likelihood of success. In the context of countering China’s economic coercion, deterrence by denial has several advantages over deterrence by punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deterrence-by-punishment-versus-deterrence-by-denial&quot;&gt;Deterrence by Punishment versus Deterrence by Denial&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence is most often associated with punishment. That is to say, if to deter is “to prevent from action by fear of consequences,” the consequences to be feared, under a deterrence-by-punishment framework, are cultivated through threat of punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War doctrine of mutually assured destruction is the paradigmatic example of deterrence by punishment. Nuclear war between the United States and Soviet Union was avoided by the recognition that an attack on one would prompt a retaliatory strike by the other, making a first strike in neither’s interest. Although some have argued a similar logic of punishment should be applied to deter China’s economic coercion, attempting to counter China’s economic coercion by threatening retaliation in kind would face several challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PUNISHMENT AND THE WILLINGNESS DILEMMA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credibility is the foundation of any deterrence policy. For a threat to be credible, the sender must both be willing and able to carry it out. In the context of retaliating against China for its use of economic coercion, the United States, the world’s largest economy, with the deepest capital markets and most innovative technology sector, undoubtedly can inflict significant pain on China through the use of economic measures. The Trump administration’s trade war and the Biden administration’s export controls on semiconductors clearly demonstrate this ability. The issue, then, is not capability but willingness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of China’s economic coercion, signaling willingness to carry out threats is made more difficult by China directing its coercive measures at U.S. allies and partners rather than at the United States itself. It is one thing to threaten retaliation to a direct attack on the homeland; it is another to do so on behalf of a third party, especially when retaliation carries direct domestic costs while the attack on the third party does not. This is especially true in instances of Chinese economic coercion where U.S. firms and producers stand to benefit commercially from an ally’s misfortune. In the deterrence literature, expanding deterrence to include allies and partners is known as “extended deterrence” as opposed to “primary deterrence,” which aims only to deter threats on the homeland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Thomas Schelling, “the difference between the national homeland and everything ‘abroad’ is the difference between threats that are inherently credible, even if unspoken, and the threats that have to be made credible.” French general Charles de Gaulle captured the essence of this willingness dilemma in the context of extended deterrence when he asked U.S. president John F. Kennedy if the United States would, in the context of nuclear war, be willing to “trade New York for Paris.” Thankfully, the stakes are much lower in the economic domain than in the nuclear one. In the case of economic coercion, an analogous exchange might be between wines — Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon for Australian Shiraz — instead of cities. However, the comparatively low stakes complicate willingness and thus credibility in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A military attack on a treaty ally, or even a friendly non-ally, may have the effect of rallying the American people, making them willing to bear costs even if the United States is not threatened or attacked itself and thereby making a threat of retaliation on behalf of an ally a credible threat. The response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a recent, if imperfect, example. At the same time, given the high stakes involved in the military — and especially the nuclear — domain, even if a threat does not seem rational, it still may have a deterrent effect. If the odds were only one in 100 that the United States would have traded New York for Paris, would the Soviet Union still have wanted to wager all of Moscow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of economic coercion, China could probe the credibility of U.S. economic threats without fear of major consequences. Losing access to U.S.-sourced Napa cabernet seems a small price to pay when defending a core interest, while commercial harm to Australian Shiraz sellers seems unlikely to rouse the sympathies of the American people. Moving up the escalation ladder also does not necessarily represent a solution for the United States. Threats are more credible when they are proportional. If the threat is too extreme relative to the behavior being deterred, the target will dismiss it as unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed, though China’s coercive economic policies may be costly at the sectoral level, they rarely, if ever, have a significant macroeconomic impact on the targeted country. Therefore, if the United States were to threaten retaliation with policies that had a macroeconomic impact on China, it would represent an escalatory response, one that would carry significant economic costs and political risks for the United States due to the size and centrality of China’s economy. This strains the credibility of such a threat, especially when U.S. firms are not in Beijing’s crosshairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the threat of retaliation were limited to a proportional response, it is still unclear if the United States would be willing to follow through. The punitive economic measures the United States has implemented against China during the trade and technology war have been justified on the grounds of direct threats to U.S. national and economic security. Would these policies, which carry economic, diplomatic, and political costs, be accepted on the grounds that, for example, Norwegian salmon farmers need U.S. protection?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the United States follows through with similar policies in response to China’s economic coercion, it is unclear if this would alter Beijing’s behavior. Given that China has not abandoned its industrial policies in the face of U.S. tariffs and export controls, is it reasonable to assume China would acquiesce to perceived challenges to core interests? On the contrary, retaliation may actually help Beijing legitimize its coercion, which is often justified to the Chinese people in nationalistic terms, enhancing the resilience of its policies and maybe even their deterrent effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In threatening to retaliate, then, the United States faces a catch-22. If it responds proportionally, the additional cost incurred by China is unlikely to alter Beijing’s calculus. But if it threatens an escalatory response, it becomes more difficult to credibly signal willingness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The informal nature of China’s economic coercion poses another challenge to the credibility of a U.S. threat of retaliation. One strategy for demonstrating commitment to a threat is to ensure the adversary has the “last clear chance” to change their mind. This is often conceptualized as an army burning the bridge behind it to demonstrate it cannot retreat and to force its opponent to decide whether or not to attack. Through the Cold War to today, the United States has signaled its commitment to retaliate in response to an attack on an ally by stationing troops in allied countries where they would be in harm’s way in the event of an attack, making it more likely the United States would respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In masking its economic coercion through the use of informal measures, China is in effect ensuring the United States has the last clear chance to avert confrontation, giving Beijing an advantage in instances of informal economic coercion. Because it is nearly impossible to come up with a definition that clearly captures China’s economic coercion, the United States can always back out of its commitment to retaliate by simply agreeing with China’s assertion that economic coercion is not taking place. In addition, if a definition of economic coercion were put forward to bind the United States to a response, Beijing could simply find ways to engage in coercion without violating the letter of the law. It is therefore unclear how the United States could metaphorically burn the bridge. Private firms, unlike soldiers, cannot be positioned where coercion is likely to occur. Even if they could, it is unclear if they would even be a target, let alone trigger a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, identifying China’s economic coercion in practice will always involve some discretion, an element of “you know it when you see it.” This discretion is necessary to give policymakers flexibility in their response, but in that discretion, there is also always a path for retreat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COALITIONS AND THEIR DISCONTENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempting to build a coalition to retaliate faces its own set of challenges, not least of which is again the difficulty of establishing credibility. Every country in a hypothetical anti-coercion coalition would face its own willingness dilemma, making achieving consensus on retaliation more difficult than if the United States acted alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, if a targeted member country could simply trigger a coalition response, akin to NATO’s Article 5 provision, a moral hazard is created. Members that are relatively unexposed to China’s market may be incentivized to take unnecessarily provocative positions vis-à-vis China at the expense of members that are deeply economically intertwined with China, thereby exposing them to substantial risk in a retaliation scenario. Indeed, creation of a moral hazard has emerged as a primary concern among some member states as the European Union moves to implement its anti-coercion instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of a moral hazard also highlights another related potential problem with a retaliation-oriented coalitional approach: uneven costs and leverage. Not only are countries varied in their dependence on China’s market, but China is also varied in its dependence on different countries for different items. So not only are some countries at greater risk of China’s retaliation, but there are also countries that could be called upon to incur greater costs to punish China than others. Australian iron ore, for example, has been identified as a Chinese vulnerability that an anti-coercion coalition could exploit. China imports around 60 percent of its iron ore from Australia. In its coercive campaign against Canberra, Beijing did not target iron ore due to the prospective domestic economic cost. However, Australia also did not cut off iron ore exports to punish China, as that would likewise carry significant domestic costs for Canberra. Nor did Australia need to take this step: Canberra has not acquiesced to Beijing’s coercion, and China is now even beginning to make diplomatic overtures as tensions enter their sixth year. If Canberra is unwilling to cut off iron ore exports to China when directly targeted by Beijing, why would Australia be willing to do so when a third country is being coerced?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credibility challenges aside, it is not clear that U.S. allies and partners would be interested in joining a coalition with a mission of retaliating against China. As competition between the United States and China has intensified, U.S. allies and partners have resisted choosing between Washington and Beijing. The new multilateral economic groupings and frameworks established by the Biden administration, such as the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), have largely reflected this reality, with the White House refraining from explicitly linking their establishment to concerns about a more confrontational China. Even the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was presented as the economic component of the Obama administration’s broader pivot to Asia, kept the door open for Chinese membership should Beijing meet the agreement’s high standards. In addition, when deciding whether to join such an arrangement, countries would face a window of vulnerability during which China might try to coerce them. The formation of a retaliatory coalition would also play into PRC talking points about U.S. efforts to contain China and undermine its legitimate interests, again legitimizing Beijing’s coercive tactics. All of these factors may make third countries less than willing to join a U.S.-led coalition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the higher-level question of whether deterrence by punishment is the policy path that coerced countries themselves prefer. When facing China’s economic coercion, officials from coerced countries generally have expressed a preference for de-escalation and have speculated that U.S.-led retaliation could lead to escalation by Beijing — escalation that likely would not be directed at the United States but again at smaller U.S. allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE CASE FOR DETERRENCE BY DENIAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence by denial offers an alternative better suited to countering China’s use of economic coercion than deterrence by punishment. It not only is more credible and conducive to coalition building but also provides the United States with a superior diplomatic message. It faces fewer operationalization barriers and allows the United States and allies to capitalize on the self-defeating aspect of China’s behavior in a way that a deterrence strategy based on the logic of punishment fails to account for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence by denial aims to prevent an adversary from taking an unwanted action not through fear of punishment but rather through fear of failure. Importantly, especially in the context of countering China’s economic coercion, deterrence by denial shifts the onus of action from the defender onto the attacker, making it easier for the deterrer to signal willingness. It is the adversary that now has the last clear chance to avoid confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where retaliation is by definition taken after the fact, policies aimed at denying China success in its economic coercion can be implemented preemptively. Examples of such policies might include supply chain resiliency initiatives, identification and reduction of asymmetric dependencies in the terms of trade (to the extent possible), and deeper economic integration with allies and partners through the negotiation of free trade agreements to reduce the relative importance of China’s market. None of these measures need wait for an instance of Chinese economic coercion to be implemented, and no formal definition of Chinese economic coercion need be agreed on beforehand, depriving China of one of the primary advantages of the informality of its coercive measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For deterrence, both by denial and by punishment, to be most effective, the deterrer must clearly communicate its threats or, in the case of denial, its defensive measures. Telegraphing defensive steps, or possible punishments, allows the adversary to update their cost-benefit assessment of the action the defender is seeking to deter. In the military domain, if you want to deter an adversary from launching a missile strike, the adversary needs to know that you have a missile defense system before it attacks in order to update their assessment of the likelihood of success. Applying the analogy to the economic domain, knowing that a state is taking steps to reduce the likelihood of economic coercion being successful allows China the opportunity to update its cost and benefit analysis before implementing coercive measures rather than after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deterrence-by-denial strategy has the added benefit of turning what would be a weakness in a deterrence-by-punishment strategy into a strength. It is impossible to guard against every vector of attack. This is especially true in the case of China’s economic coercion. Given the size and importance of China’s market, it is neither advisable nor possible for states to completely decouple economically. Therefore, China will always have some levers that it can pull in an attempt to influence target states’ politics and policies. It should be expected, then, that China will probe for weaknesses in any economic defenses that are constructed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under a deterrence-by-punishment framework, failure to respond to Chinese provocation with retaliation would erode U.S. credibility and thus the deterrent effect of the framework. However, under a deterrence-by-denial framework, China can still attempt to coerce a target, but so long as the targeted country does not back down, the framework’s deterrent effect is not weakened but instead may be strengthened. Over time, a series of successes where China coerces and the target does not acquiesce can further enhance the deterrent effect as Beijing comes to see the futility of its actions. This is a phenomenon referred to in the literature as cumulative deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit afforded by the deterrence-by-denial approach is that even were it to fail in the sense that Beijing was undeterred, it would still mitigate the impact of China’s coercion on the targeted country. In doing so, not only would the costs to China increase, but it would also represent an opportunity for the United States to publicly shame or criticize China for its behavior, a tactic which has been shown effective in the criminology and counterterrorism contexts, where deterrence by denial has had an influential role in policy development. In addition, the more Beijing attempts to coerce, the more other potential targets should come to recognize the risks of economic dependence on China and the more willing they should become to work with the United States preemptively to adopt defensive strategies, reducing the effectiveness of future Chinese coercive actions and advancing U.S. efforts to decouple its allies from the Chinese economy in certain sensitive sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a deterrence-by-denial strategy has distinct advantages for multilateralizing a response to China’s economic coercion. Because it does not involve retaliating directly at China, states should be more willing to coordinate their policies, in part evidenced by the interest among allies and partners in U.S.-led supply chain resiliency initiatives, such as those in the TTC and the IPEF. Moreover, unlike in a deterrence-by-punishment strategy, states are not necessarily asked to take an action to help a third country but to take steps that are in their own direct self-interest, such as making their economies more resilient against external shocks. Indeed, Japan and South Korea, both previous targets of China’s economic coercion, have undertaken policy initiatives aimed at better insulating their economies from Chinese manipulation via China exit subsidies and the New Southern Policy, respectively. As mentioned, allies and partners do not need to agree on a definition of China’s economic coercion to coordinate on resiliency initiatives. Instead, all that is needed is mutual recognition that the problem exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-4-when-is-extended-deterrence-by-punishment-warranted&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 4. When Is Extended Deterrence by Punishment Warranted?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Should the United States ever pursue deterrence by punishment to counter Beijing’s economic coercion of a U.S. ally? A strategy of extended deterrence by punishment faces more acute credibility challenges and could lead to unwanted escalation. It also engenders greater difficulties mobilizing political support both at home and multilaterally. Still, it is worth exploring whether certain outlier cases might exist — short of a direct conflict between the United States and China — in which Chinese economic coercion may warrant either an ex ante U.S. threat of retaliation or ex post U.S. punishment response.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s economic coercion could credibly be met with a U.S. threat of retaliation in a scenario where the measures implemented against a U.S. ally are so severe that they cause serious macroeconomic damage. In such a scenario, U.S. interests would be significantly challenged, and the threat of a response that would inflict significant costs on China becomes proportional to Beijing’s actions. Further, other countries may be in favor of or in line with a retaliatory response given the scale of the damage.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;However, China’s economic coercion has never risen to such a level of macroeconomic damage despite arguably having opportunities in the cases of Japan and Australia. In the Japan case, China lifted its rare earths export ban before imposing severe costs to the Japanese economy. In Australia’s case, China did not target iron ore due to the domestic costs. Likewise, China opted not to take more severe measures against South Korea when it failed to target trade in “intermediary goods in the IT sector,” which also would have incurred domestic costs for China. This is consistent with Beijing’s observed pattern of minimizing costs to its own economy in its implementation of coercive economic measures.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chinese military writings provide some insight into the conditions under which China’s economic coercion might rise to a destructive threshold despite high domestic costs. The PLA’s Course Book on the Taiwan Strait’s Military Geography envisions a seizure of Taiwan enabling blockades of Japan. Military planners speculate, “If we can reduce Japan’s raw imports by 15–20 percent, it will be a heavy blow to Japan’s economy.” Moreover, a reduction in imports by 50 percent “can even create a famine within the Japanese islands.” Obviously, the United States would want to deter a Chinese-imposed famine on the Japanese islands, and the destruction of Japan’s “economic activity and war-making potential” would represent a direct challenge to U.S. strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;However, this hypothetical scenario also reveals that to inflict such severe economic damage, China must not only use military means against a U.S. treaty ally but also occupy Taiwan. The former already carries a direct threat of U.S. retaliation, while in the latter case the United States has increasingly signaled it would intervene with economic sanctions, if not militarily. In short, the severe macroeconomic damage that would make a U.S. threat of economic retaliation credible already crosses U.S. red lines and likely also crosses into the military domain — putting it outside the scope of the cases of economic coercion that this report seeks to address.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is harder to imagine scenarios short of war where China would inflict such severe economic damage, as China has proven itself averse to incurring costs from economic coercion. However, China’s central position within the structure of international trade — especially its growing market power over areas such as critical minerals, mature-node semiconductors, and global shipping and logistics — gives Beijing economic leverage over U.S. allies that the CCP is actively seeking to enhance. The CCP’s industrial policy goals, as best encapsulated in Xi Jinping’s aspiration to “create an enormous gravitational force for international commodities and key resources,” appear to envision a future in which China’s ever-greater economic centrality translates to a concomitant rise in its geopolitical influence. At the same time, Beijing is seeking to limit its vulnerability to external economic shocks. If successful, China may be more willing and able to inflict greater economic costs on states it perceives to have challenged its interests. That said, given the limited economic impact of China’s economic coercion observed so far, an escalation by Beijing does not necessarily translate into significant economic damage for a targeted country.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Another scenario where the United States might credibly threaten retaliation is one where a targeted ally requests the United States respond to China’s economic coercion with punitive measures. There is likely significant overlap between this scenario and a scenario where China’s economic coercion causes severe damage to an ally’s economy. In no cases surveyed in this report did an ally appear to request the United States retaliate against China on its behalf, nor did any try to retaliate against China themselves. On the contrary, targeted countries seemed to prefer de-escalation as a response. In some cases, former officials expressed a belief that U.S. retaliation would only make the situation worse. However, these officials also indicated they sought greater U.S. support amid these crises and were frustrated when support did not materialize. Any strategy aimed at helping U.S. allies and partners should take into consideration the views of those allies and partners.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operationalizing-a-deterrence-by-denial-strategy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Operationalizing a Deterrence-by-Denial Strategy: Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study proposes a counterstrategy premised on deterrence by denial rather than by punishment. The counterstrategy has two mutually reinforcing components: preemptive actions focused on building partner resilience (denying the coercer targets of opportunity), and reactive steps focused on providing relief to victims once coercion has occurred (deflecting the coercer’s intent). Together these components work to mitigate and over time deter China’s economic coercion. The counterstrategy considers the characteristics of and motivations behind China’s economic coercion. It acknowledges that China’s economic coercion is problematic but also recognizes that China’s coercion is not an insurmountable challenge and has a poor track record of success. It focuses on building resilience and providing relief to affected firms and nations instead of directly punishing China and in doing so mitigates costs to potential target countries while maximizing reputational and economic costs for Beijing. Over time, the aim of the strategy is to demonstrate to China the futility of its coercive actions, prompting Beijing to abandon its disruptive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PREEMPTIVE DENIAL POLICIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first pillar of the counterstrategy is preemptive denial. It involves implementing defensive resiliency measures to reduce partners’ vulnerability to Beijing’s prospective coercion. Acknowledging it is impossible to completely eliminate all vulnerabilities, countries can nevertheless seek to diversify markets and supply chains and proactively identify potential alternative markets should China attempt to disrupt normal commercial relations. These efforts would raise the cost of economic coercion for China while decreasing its likelihood of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific policies and tools of denial include the following, which should be put in place before any Chinese coercion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Establish an interagency “CoerCom.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is organizational. To pool knowledge and resources, coordinate, and centralize U.S. counter-coercion strategies and initiatives, the U.S. government should establish a new interagency committee: the Committee on Countering China’s Economic Coercion, or “CoerCom.” The committee would resemble the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) in structure. It would comprise cabinet members and directors from relevant departments and agencies such as the Departments of State, Treasury, and Commerce; units of the Executive Office of the President, including the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Office of Management and Budget, Council of Economic Advisers, National Security Council, and National Economic Council; and relevant governmental and quasi-governmental agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, and Export-Import Bank of the United States. CoerCom would make recommendations to the president on the policies and tools of denial discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Build a coercion-denial coalition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should take the initiative by unilaterally setting up its own counter-coercion policies. However, Washington should work to encourage the voluntary adoption of similar approaches by Group of Seven (G7) and other advanced industrial countries, with all such strategies focused on denial rather than punishment. As others set up their own counter-coercion programs, relief policies (discussed below) can be coordinated through G7 processes to enhance the quality and amount of relief flowing to a targeted country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next question that arises is to which countries should the United States and other G7 countries extend an “economic security umbrella,” offering them the promise of relief if they were to be economically coerced. In deterrence theory, there is often a tension between inclusivity and credibility. China may not find it credible that the United States would be willing to aid states with whom the United States does not have a strong strategic interest at stake. If the United States makes a commitment and then does not follow through, it raises questions about whether aid will be forthcoming if another country finds itself in Beijing’s crosshairs. If states lose trust in the U.S. commitment, then the deterrent effect of China’s economic coercion remains intact, as states will hesitate to challenge China for fear of retribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To maintain credibility, an explicit commitment might be limited to a subset of close treaty allies. It could be expanded out from there to include other allies and strategic partners, then perhaps to countries with which the United States has trade agreements. However, as policymakers decide to delineate U.S. commitments, the basic trade-off between inclusivity, on one side, and costs and credibility, on the other, should be kept in mind. Where the United States does not explicitly commit to providing relief to all countries, it could signal that in special cases where the coercion of a state outside the explicit “economic security umbrella” could still be eligible for relief should an interest of the United States be challenged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Review vulnerabilities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments and firms in countries at risk of coercion should conduct economy-wide reviews to identify potentially vulnerable industries and sectors. Vulnerable industries and sectors can be in part identified by considering patterns of China’s coercive behavior identified in the case studies. Such sectors include those in which China has an asymmetric advantage, has a strategic interest or domestic competitors or interest groups that benefit from protectionism, can readily find substitutes, and will not incur high costs, as well as sectors that are politically important in the targeted country. Table 6 offers a possible framework for assessing a given sector’s vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Fiz1Kw2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image7&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EnbTLB3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 6. Assessing a Sector’s Vulnerability to Chinese Economic Coercion.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can aid allies and partners by providing technical assistance with their vulnerability reviews. CoerCom can provide subject matter experts and coordinate efforts among partners. In addition to identifying vulnerabilities, potential disruptions can be modeled to help inform mitigation strategies. Preemptively identifying alternative markets should speed adjustments during a coercive campaign, reducing costs. Although China has rarely made use of export restrictions, it may look to do so in the future. Therefore, limited stockpiling of critical components by vulnerable firms may be advisable to limit disruption to operations and allow time to identify new suppliers. Much of the knowledge about the structure of supply chains rests in the private sector, so governments should provide incentives and share information so firms can undertake many of these mitigation strategies themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Reinforce supply chain resiliency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flurry of supply chain resiliency initiatives that were launched amid the supply chain disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and then accelerated by the war in Ukraine provide a model and a platform for states guarding against China’s economic coercion. China exercises its coercive economic leverage largely through other states’ dependencies on its market. Therefore, supply chain resiliency initiatives should factor vulnerability to Chinese economic coercion into their assessments when seeking to build resilient supply chains. Efforts to build supply chains less vulnerable to China’s economic coercion can be embedded in recently created and ongoing multilateral initiatives such as the TTC and the IPEF, both of which have dedicated supply chain resiliency components. In fact, the TTC has already explicitly stated its members seek to “build resilience to economic coercion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separate supply chain resiliency initiatives could be established to address China’s coercion, but there is a benefit of couching counter-coercion initiatives within broader ongoing supply chain resilience initiatives. Such positioning provides states with some diplomatic cover, making it less likely China will attempt to deter their participation. That said, it is important that China’s economic coercion receive dedicated attention as China tends to target items that ongoing supply chain resiliency initiatives may not cover. For example, there has been significant attention placed on securing semiconductor supply chains, but China has proven reluctant to target high-technology goods in its coercive campaigns, as doing so would harm its own economic development. Instead, China has shown a preference for targeting substitutable commodities and consumer goods that may not receive attention in a narrowly scoped supply chain resiliency context, which tends to focus on goods critical to national security and emergency preparedness. Likewise, ongoing supply chain resiliency initiatives that emerged after the Covid-19 pandemic also primarily focus on possible disruption of access to critical goods and inputs, whereas China, except for in the cases of Japan and Lithuania, prefers to block imports rather than restrict exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with government incentives, it can take years and be very costly for firms to diversify their supply chains. Japan’s diversification of its rare earth supply chain away from China following the Senkakus fishing boat incident is emblematic. In what may be the most ambitious supply chain relocation effort to date, Japan’s move required tens of billions of yen of state investment and a high level of state capacity and intervention in the market. After nine years and several setbacks, Japan has made a sizable dent in its dependency on China for rare earths. In 2020 Japan relied on China for 58 percent of its rare earths, down from 85 percent in 2009. Tokyo aims to further reduce that reliance to below 50 percent by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s efforts draw attention to the difficulty and costs of achieving even moderate levels of resilience and diversification. Japan’s case is also unique for a couple of important reasons. China’s export restriction on rare earths represented a severe threat to Japan’s economy. It therefore made economic and strategic sense for Japan to devote a large amount of resources to develop alternative sources. In most cases, however, China’s economic coercion has not proven extremely costly for the targeted country. Therefore, states considering diversifying their supply chains away from China to mitigate risk of economic coercion by Beijing need to ensure the cure is not worse than the disease. In some cases, the cost of diversification could be greater than the economic pain China is willing or able to inflict via economic coercion. In those cases, it is likely better to be prepared to provide relief to affected firms and sectors after coercion begins (the second component of this strategy, discussed below) than devote significant resources to preemptively diversify supply chains that may or may not be targeted in the future and, if targeted, likely would not significantly harm the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan also benefited from unique state institutions, such as the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and especially the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC), which led and managed Japan’s diversification operations. Other states may lack the capacity to replicate such an ambitious endeavor. Moreover, a broader shift to managed trade is not one that should be undertaken lightly. Japan’s dependency on China for rare earths represents a critical vulnerability. There may be other critical vulnerabilities that likewise require large initiatives to diversify. But these efforts should be narrowly targeted. In seeking to counter China’s coercion, it is important not to violate the very norms and rules of international commerce that the counter strategy is seeking to protect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Negotiate free trade agreements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can help strengthen resilience to China’s economic coercion by negotiating trade agreements that offer meaningful market access to signatories. Opening U.S. markets to allies and partners can help reduce dependence on China’s market and speed market adjustments in cases of coercion. Trade negotiations also present an opportunity for allies and partners to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities to China’s economic coercion. In addition, trade agreements offer the opportunity to proactively implement coercion-specific measures. Creative policy solutions might include temporary and additional tariff reduction by signatories on certain goods targeted by China if a signatory finds itself a victim of Chinese economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current unwillingness of the United States to negotiate free trade agreements cedes the economic arena to China, which through its own trade efforts is seeking to shape the international economic environment to one that increases foreign countries’ investment in China while insulating the Chinese economy from exogenous shocks — potentially enhancing its ability to carry out economic coercion campaigns against U.S. allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. Establish a U.S. anti-coercion instrument (USACI).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the European Union’s proposed ACI would empower the European Commission to put together a portfolio of proportional retaliatory policies in response to an instance of economic coercion, the United States should establish its own anti-coercion instrument. However, instead of being comprised of punishment-oriented tools, the USACI should be comprised of new and existing relief-oriented tools collapsed into a single instrument that can be tailored to respond to the unique circumstances of each specific incidence of Chinese economic coercion. This will provide the United States with the flexibility necessary to respond to China’s economic coercion. Specifically, the USACI should be comprised of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a. A new coercion compensation fund&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should create and fund a coercion compensation fund. When a case of economic coercion is identified and relief authorized by the president, the funds would be transferred to the targeted country to be distributed to affected industries and firms. CoerCom would recommend how much funding should be released and oversee the distribution of the funds by the targeted government. The funds are not intended to offset the entire cost of China’s coercion, but instead to provide some compensation to help cover the costs of finding new markets or suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not expected that this fund would need to be very large to be effective. For example, the two investment support packages that the Canadian government offered its agriculture producers in July 2019 totaled C$19 million, and given that Canada never relented to Chinese pressure, this amount of support proved sufficient. The Canadian case also demonstrates that this fund would not be the only relief flowing to affected firms and producers. Instead, U.S. relief would complement relief provided by the targeted country to its domestic industry (see below). In addition, as new markets are found, the need for funding would decrease over time. That said, more research is needed to provide an estimate of the appropriate size of a coercion compensation fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b. Existing relief tools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States already has numerous tools at its disposal that could be used to aid a targeted country. Preemptively identifying these tools and providing the authority to deploy them in cases of coercion would allow the United States to quickly provide more economic relief to the targeted country. Apart from providing relief, these tools can also help speed market adjustments, further undermining the effectiveness of China’s economic coercion. Their use has the added benefit of raising costs, both economic and reputational, for Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, CoerCom would be responsible for recommending which tools to use depending on the specifics of the ongoing case of coercion and the needs of the targeted country. A sample of some existing policy tools that could be deployed includes but is not limited to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM) products: The EXIM has several financing tools at its disposal to promote U.S. exports. These include working capital loan guarantees, loan guarantees for foreign buyers of U.S. exports, and export credit insurance for U.S. exporters. Eligibility for these tools could be expanded to include a targeted country’s buyers of U.S. exports and U.S. exporters seeking to increase their presence in or enter the market of a targeted country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sovereign loan guarantees: The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 provides the President the authority to provide sovereign loan guarantees, under which the United States guarantees the repayment of loans made to a foreign government. This allows the foreign government cheaper and easier access to international capital, which, in the case of coercion, the targeted country could use to aid affected firms and producers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tariff reductions: Under the U.S. Constitution, authority to adjust tariff rates is vested in Congress. However, Congress often cedes that power to the president to negotiate trade agreements through Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). Likewise, authority could be granted to the president to temporarily reduce tariffs on goods from a targeted country that are facing import restrictions in China. Eligibility for goods could be based on eligibility under Generalized System of Preferences as proposed under the recently introduced Countering Economic Coercion Act of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Political risk insurance: The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) currently provides coverage of up to $1 billion against losses resulting from political risk. This authority could be expanded to provide political risk insurance coverage to U.S. and foreign investors investing in sectors and firms in targeted countries that have been adversely affected by China’s economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legal services funding: The Department of State maintains the Transaction Advisory Fund, which provides funding to government agencies in eligible Indo-Pacific countries for legal advisory services in support of infrastructure projects. Funding under this program could be authorized to be made available in cases where China violates the terms of a contract to economically coerce a targeted country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deployment of these tools would be case dependent. For example, if China restricted the export of a key commodity or good, it would be appropriate to make use of EXIM tools to encourage U.S. exporters of the same or substitutable products to backfill demand. At the same time, under that scenario, it would not make sense to lower U.S. tariffs on goods exported from the targeted country. Instead, the use of tariff reductions would be appropriate in instances where China restricts its imports from a targeted country. In practice, import restrictions are China’s preferred coercive tools, and by reducing U.S. tariffs on those targeted goods, market adjustments can be accelerated, limiting the impact of China’s coercion on the targeted country’s exporters. Sovereign loan guarantees and political risk insurance could hypothetically be employed in either cases of import or export restrictions. Both would also be applicable if China were to restrict financing to the targeted country, as was threatened in the case of Mongolia with Beijing’s cancelation of negotiations surrounding Chinese loans and funding for infrastructure projects. In such a scenario, the United States could also release legal services funding to help affected countries negotiate or address violations of contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7. Encourage partners to develop their own authorities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries vulnerable to economic coercion should preemptively expand the authority of relevant domestic agencies to provide relief to sectors and firms affected when coercion occurs. As mentioned, Canada leveraged existing authorities to provide its agriculture industry with investment support packages to cover costs of finding alternative markets, and the European Union offered financing for affected Lithuanian firms. Identifying such tools ahead of time would allow targeted states to respond even faster. Where authorities to provide such relief do not exist, vulnerable countries should preemptively adopt them. Examples might include establishing a program of political risk insurance provided at a discounted rate to vulnerable firms, or concessional loans for affected industries to cover costs until new markets can be found. The latter would have been particularly helpful in the Philippines case, as banana farmers rely on revenue from harvest to buy seeds for the following year’s crop. When China blocked imports, the business cycle was disrupted, not only harming the current harvest but also affecting the producers’ ability to plant the following year. However, an injection of capital to provide farmers the funds to plant the next year’s crop would have limited the disruption caused by China’s action. Again, the United States could offer technical assistance to help partners develop their own relief instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REACTIVE “DEFLECTION” POLICIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the preemptive denial measures described above should reduce China’s incentives to coerce vulnerable countries, coercion is likely to continue to occur. Therefore, a second pillar of a deterrence-by-denial strategy is necessary: providing economic relief and other support to a targeted country or sector once coercion has occurred. By reducing the costs of China’s economic coercion and relieving political pressure on the targeted government, relief measures should make it easier for the targeted country to resist complying, “deflecting” Beijing’s intent. U.S. offers of relief also signal to other countries that if they challenge China, and China retaliates, they will receive support from the United States. This has the added benefit of reinforcing the resiliency-enhancing policies of the first component of this strategy, as reactive relief speeds market adjustments away from China, reducing targeted countries’ vulnerability to China’s economic coercion in the future. It also provides a means of raising the costs of coercion for Beijing, allowing the United States to indirectly punish China for its behavior without the downsides of direct punishment discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommended post-coercion “deflection” policies include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8. Define actionable coercion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To release economic relief to a targeted country, an instance of economic coercion must first be identified. This is easier said than done. While the academic definition of economic coercion is straightforward, China cloaks its economic coercion in informality, pointing to alternative explanations for the decline in commercial activity such as sanitary and phytosanitary violations. This makes it difficult to set out a strict definition of economic coercion that would implicate China’s behavior. As soon as a definition is set, China could find ways to coerce around it. Instead, to paraphrase Supreme Court justice Potter Stewart in Jacobellis v. Ohio, there will always be an element of “you know it when you see it” when seeking to define China’s economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the definitional challenges posed by China’s economic coercion, the U.S. president should have the discretion to declare an instance of economic coercion. The process could look something like this: The targeted state would request U.S. assistance in countering China’s economic coercion. CoerCom would then have a short timeline to investigate and submit a recommendation to the president, much as CFIUS does when making a recommendation to the president on a foreign investment in the United States. The recommendation would then inform the president’s decision as to whether coercion is occurring. Congress would have the opportunity to overturn the president’s decision through an up-or-down vote. Moreover, if relief is provided, Congress would have the ability to halt aid at any time through an up-or-down vote. This would ensure congressional oversight and help secure domestic political support for the relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9. Deploy the USACI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once an incidence of Chinese economic coercion has been positively identified, CoerCom would provide the president with the specific set of relief policies authorized under the USACI (see recommendation 6 above) that the United States can implement to help an ally. The size, composition, and the duration of the aid package would be case-dependent, allowing the United States to tailor its response to the severity and diversity of measures that China employs in its coercive campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relief provided to the targeted country does not need to offset the total cost of China’s economic coercion — nor should it, as this might create a moral hazard where the risks of doing business with China are not fully factored into firm-level and state-level decision making. Instead, the goal of relief is to ensure that political pressure from affected sectors and firms on the targeted government is reduced to a level that the targeted government does not acquiesce to China’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond immediate relief, CoerCom should be tasked with identifying possible opportunities to incentivize and speed decoupling of the targeted country from China in critical technology and other strategic sectors. Although Beijing has avoided targeting high-tech firms, it blocked the import of certain advanced lasers needed for both materials and biotech research as well as advanced manufacturing when it placed a de facto embargo on Lithuania. During the dispute with South Korea over the deployment of THAAD, it was reported that the South Korean government asked Samsung to reconsider its $7 billion investment to build a second memory fabrication facility in Xi’an. However, Samsung went ahead with the investment, and today Samsung’s operations in Xi’an account for 15.3 percent of the global output of NAND flash memory products. This seems like a missed opportunity to reduce dependency on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Lithuania case, Taiwan responded by setting up a $200 million investment fund as well as $1 billion in credit to incentivize joint ventures between Lithuanian and Taiwanese firms, mainly focusing on synergies between Lithuania’s laser industry and Taiwan’s semiconductor industry. The United States could consider setting up an additional dedicated fund to incentivize either joint ventures with U.S. firms or investment in the United States by foreign technology firms targeted by China’s economic coercion. The funding might also be attached to restrictions on future investment in China similar to the restrictions included in the CHIPS Act. In cases where a high-tech firm is not directly targeted, such as in South Korea, there is still an opportunity for the United States to advocate for the redirection of pending investments and publicize the risks of doing business with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging China’s economic coercion to speed decoupling in critical and emerging technologies has the additional advantage of imposing costs on China that Beijing has proven sensitive to, adding an element of retaliation to an otherwise relief-oriented counterstrategy. It also spares the United States from playing bad cop, expending diplomatic capital to convince reluctant allies to decouple from China in certain sensitive sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;10. Support WTO cases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever possible, the United States should encourage the targeted state to bring a case against China to the WTO. Then the United States and other G7 members should sign on as third parties, which is allowed under WTO rules even in cases where the third parties’ economic interests are not directly challenged, if the case represents a broader challenge to the integrity of the global trading system. For example, both Australia and Canada brought cases to the WTO in response to China’s coercive economic actions. China’s informal approach and the WTO’s broken appeals process mean that such legal cases are not an effective response to China’s economic coercion by themselves, especially because speed is an essential element of an effective sanctions-busting strategy. However, filing cases, in conjunction with the other steps recommended here, is a low-cost way to signal multilateral support for both the targeted country and international norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;11. Enhance diplomatic messaging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For deterrence by denial to be most effective, the coercer needs to be aware of the upgraded defenses of its targets so that its cost-benefit calculation can be updated. Therefore, the United States and other G7 advanced economies should make statements about, and otherwise publicize, their efforts to build resilience against China’s economic coercion. This messaging campaign need not be limited to the G7, but smaller more vulnerable states also need not be pressured to make statements that could be construed as taking a position against China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deflection policies should be accompanied by a robust diplomatic messaging campaign with three priorities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a. Deflecting the psychological impact of China’s economic coercion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic coercion has not imposed significant macroeconomic costs on targeted countries. However, the psychological impact can be large, potentially causing targets to acquiesce to Beijing’s demands when a more cool-headed analysis of the coercive measures’ effects would have reassured policymakers of their ability to absorb the costs. Beginning even before China threatens vulnerable/protected states and continuing throughout China’s coercive campaign, the United States should message its intention to provide, and highlight its provision of, aid and assistance to targeted countries. In doing so, it can erode the concern China’s coercion inspires in vulnerable countries, strengthening the resolve of the targeted state and weakening the deterrent effect of the threat of China’s economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b. Shaming China by drawing attention to its problematic behavior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing relief instead of retaliating affords the United States the diplomatic moral high ground. The United States should take advantage of this opportunity to draw attention to China’s problematic behavior and juxtapose it with U.S. efforts to provide economic relief to targeted countries. In theory, this should increase the reputational costs China incurs from its use of economic coercion and accelerate Beijing’s already declining image around the world. At the same time, drawing attention to China’s arbitrary and capricious actions may encourage firms to reconsider dependencies on China’s market, aiding diversification efforts. If, by contrast, the United States were to pursue retaliation against China, it would surrender the moral high ground and potentially help the PRC legitimize its coercive actions domestically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;c. Highlighting the ineffectiveness of China’s coercion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s coercion is already frequently ineffective. Providing relief will make it even less effective. Drawing attention to this should enhance deterrence by denial by both demonstrating to vulnerable countries they have little to fear from China and signaling to China that its policies do not achieve their intended effect and instead, in some cases, work against Beijing’s own interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF AN EFFECTIVE DETERRENCE-BY-DENIAL STRATEGY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intertwining Components&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denial policies can encourage states to adopt their own deflection policies, decreasing the burden on the United States and enhancing the sanctions-busting power of the counterstrategy. Supply chain resilience initiatives and free trade agreements, in particular, provide useful platforms. For example, trade agreements could include commitments by signatories to establish their own coercion compensation funds with clear processes for when and how they are deployed. Signatories might also commit to preemptively authorizing relative agencies and departments to provide concessional loans, export credit, political risk insurance, and so on to help speed market realignments in instances of coercion. Embedding such policy discussions in the context of a free trade negotiation or a multilateral supply chain resilience initiative has the added benefit of ensuring coordination and allowing for dissemination of best practices to prevent abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avoiding Moral Hazard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One theoretical risk to providing relief to firms targeted by China’s economic coercion involves placing firms in positions of moral hazard. Firms may not accurately price the risk of doing business in China because they assume the U.S. government will bail them out if they are coerced. This assumption could encourage firms that would have otherwise had incentive to diversify away from China to remain overly dependent on China’s market, thus preserving China’s economic leverage, which Beijing could translate into future geostrategic influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, states under the U.S. economic security umbrella might also be placed in a position of moral hazard. Again, the expectation of U.S. aid could encourage states to take positions on China that might be popular with domestic political constituencies but are nonetheless overly antagonistic. This could create needless diplomatic tension, constraining U.S. ability to engage with China when needed and expending U.S. resources in an unproductive manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite the theoretical arguments for these moral hazards, it is unlikely that either hazard would emerge under the proposed counterstrategy. The amount of relief provided is not intended to offset the total cost of China’s coercion; it is only meant to help speed market adjustments and decrease the amount of political pressure targeted firms might place on their home governments. It therefore seems unrealistic to expect that firms would not factor in the possible cost to their operations due to China’s propensity to engage in economic coercion. Likewise, the counterstrategy seems unlikely to encourage states to take overly aggressive positions vis-à-vis China for the same reason. The relief provided is not sufficient to remove all risks. Moreover, the processes in place for identifying instances of economic coercion should guard against frivolous claims of economic coercion. Unlike in a punishment-oriented strategy, there is little risk for unnecessary escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domestic Political Support&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any effective counterstrategy should have domestic political support. Without this, the credibility of the U.S. response could be undermined if targeted countries and China believe the United States will not follow through with promised relief due to domestic political opposition. The most likely stakeholders from which domestic political opposition could arise are U.S. firms and producers that stand to benefit from China’s economic coercion of foreign rivals and could be harmed by the proposed U.S. response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A paradox of China’s economic coercion is that while firms in the targeted countries are harmed, rival firms in the United States and in other allied countries can benefit. For example, exports of Californian and French wine to China reportedly increased after China restricted imports of Australian Shiraz. Providing relief to Shiraz producers in Australia then could rouse accusations from domestic producers of subsidizing foreign competitors. Likewise, reducing tariffs on targeted goods could cause domestic competitors to object. However, despite the possibility of some domestic political opposition, there is reason to believe that the counterstrategy would receive broad political support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, countering China has become a point of bipartisan consensus in Washington. Even though some U.S. firms and producers may see their interests undermined by the counterstrategy, their opposition would likely be muted, as members of Congress are loath to look weak on countering China. This dynamic can be seen in the Biden administration’s recent export controls on semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Despite the costs for domestic industry due to loss of access to China’s market, there has been no vocal opposition from Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the counterstrategy is designed to be both narrowly targeted and subject to congressional oversight, which should help ensure strong domestic political support. Again, the strategy is not intended to offset all costs of China’s economic coercion, just to provide sufficient relief to reduce political pressure on the targeted country by helping firms find new markets quickly. The limited nature of the relief should mitigate concerns that domestic industry might have that the U.S. government is subsidizing their foreign competitors. Likewise, the CoerCom review process for coercion claims should guard against free-riding concerns, while congressional oversight throughout the process is designed to ensure domestic constituencies potentially harmed by relief policies have an opportunity to raise concerns through their elected representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, on the denial side of the counterstrategy, there is strong bipartisan support for supply chain resilience initiatives. Although the current protectionist sentiment in Washington has impeded U.S. negotiation of new free trade agreements, most Americans still view free trade as a net positive for the economy. At the same time, with Americans increasingly supportive of efforts to counter China, positioning free trade agreements with allies as a key component of that effort, especially as a counter to malign Chinese economic influence, may represent a path back to a more robust trade policy. Moving forward on the preemptive denial components of the counterstrategy has the added benefit of signaling U.S. commitment, as discussed previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic sanctions literature indicates that sanctions lose their bite over time as new markets and work-arounds are found, political coalitions within the sending state fracture due to rising costs, and views of the coercing state harden within the target state. Therefore, it is imperative that relief reaches the targeted country quickly. This means that even if other G7 members adopt similar counter-coercion policies and commitments to aid targeted countries, the United States should still retain the ability to act unilaterally rather than waiting until consensus is achieved among partners on whether a case of coercion merits a response. After the United States acts, it should encourage allies to follow suit, beginning with G7 members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iterative Action&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be successful, the counterstrategy does not have to deter China as soon as it is unveiled. Instead, its deterrent effect can be strengthened by each instance of China’s economic coercion. Over time, China will come to see the futility and costs of its actions. At the same time, the counterstrategy will signal to allied and partner governments that the United States stands ready to support them. Moreover, each time China coerces, it represents an opportunity for the United States to help a partner country harden its economy to coercion by removing leverage that China might be able to exploit in the future. The two components of the counterstrategy — denial and deflection — effectively reinforce each other this way. Even if complete deterrence is not achieved, the strategy is flexible enough to promote U.S. interests by simply raising the costs and lowering the efficacy of China’s problematic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Credibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credibility is essential to any deterrence policy. As discussed above, in the context of countering China’s economic coercion, a deterrence-by-denial strategy is more credible than a deterrence-by-punishment approach. However, there are still steps that policymakers should take to enhance the credibility of the outlined counterstrategy, especially the reactive deflection component. Specifically, the relief must be released in clear instances of Chinese economic coercion. The counterstrategy’s credibility will be enhanced even more if that relief effectively prevents the targeted country from backing down. If, however, relief is not forthcoming or is ineffective, then China, as well as targeted countries, may come to question U.S. commitment. The result in this case may be that China is not deterred, while third countries self-censor to avoid provoking Beijing. The question of whether the United States will provide relief can be addressed by legislating that the United States must respond, as outlined in this proposed counterstrategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. policymakers should be objective about the threat posed to U.S. interests by China’s economic coercion. A careful examination of cases of China’s economic coercion over the past decade reveals that, while problematic, it has largely been ineffective. It imposes costs on the targeted sectors, but China’s own aversion to costs and risks, combined with the power of markets to adapt, limit Beijing’s ability to impose significant economy-wide costs on the targeted economy. That said, China’s economic coercion provides Beijing with an avenue through which to signal resolve and possibly deter third countries from adopting policy positions that run contrary to the party’s perceived interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even if China’s coercion does achieve some deterrence, it is still not in the interest of the United States to exaggerate the threat posed by China’s behavior. In fact, doing so may paradoxically play into Beijing’s hands. It could enhance the psychological impact of China’s coercion or the threat thereof, making the targeted state more likely to acquiesce and vulnerable states less likely to challenge Beijing. If the United States is tempted to employ tactics similar to China’s in an effort to deter Beijing’s problematic behavior, it may unintentionally legitimize China’s economic coercion while also upsetting allies and partners and further undermining the norms of the international rules-based order that the United States is seeking to protect and uphold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that China’s behavior should be tolerated. On the contrary, it should be deterred — and deterrence by denial, rather than by punishment, provides the United States with the best way to do that. As operationalized above, a counterstrategy centered around deterrence by denial would deter China’s economic coercion over time by raising the costs for China while also demonstrating to Beijing the futility of its actions. It would accomplish this by both proactively hardening states’ economies to China’s economic coercion through a combination of diversification away from China and closer economic integration with the United States (denial) and by setting up mechanisms that would enable the United States to provide financial relief to affected firms in targeted countries, thus speeding up market adjustments (deflection).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deterrence-by-denial approach has several advantages over a deterrence-by-punishment approach. First and foremost, it is much more credible, and without credibility, deterrence fails. It has the benefit of being more easily multilateralized. It allows the United States to maintain the diplomatic high ground while also avoiding the needless and counterproductive risk of escalation between Washington and Beijing. It also factors in the preferences of allies and partners that are targets of China’s economic coercion. Further, deterrence by denial plays to the United States’ comparative advantage, using the power of the market to bust China’s sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, in resisting the temptation to retaliate, the United States remains true to its values, upholding the norms of international commerce that have enabled an era of prosperity. As U.S. diplomat George Kennan states in the final paragraph of his 1946 “long telegram”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Finally, we must have courage and self-confidence to cling to our own methods and conceptions of human society. After all, the greatest danger that can befall us in coping with this problem of Soviet Communism, is that we shall allow ourselves to become like those with whom we are coping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japan-fishing-boat-captain-arrest-2010&quot;&gt;Japan: Fishing Boat Captain Arrest (2010)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 8, 2010, a Chinese fishing vessel rammed two Japanese coast guard boats during a chase in the contested Senkaku/Diaoyu island chain. Japan is the effective administrator of the seas around the islands as per a 1997 fishery agreement between Tokyo and Beijing, making the islands subject to Japanese domestic law. As a result, the Chinese crew was detained and the captain arrested on suspicion of obstructing Japanese law enforcement due to alleged malicious behavior. While the crew was released after questioning, the captain remained in custody as Japanese prosecutors considered whether to indict him. On September 20, Japanese prosecutors announced a 10-day extension of the captain’s detention. Prior to this case, Japan had detained “Chinese-origin intruders” but had never threatened indictment. In considering an indictment in this case, Japan challenged the mutually understood 1997 agreement and note verbale precedent that the two countries would separate fishery disputes from territorial disputes, and that flag state law, not coastal state law, would apply to fishing activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINESE MEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the arrest, China lodged diplomatic protests, ceased intergovernmental contacts, and tightened customs inspections on Japanese imports. Chinese netizens called for a boycott of Japanese goods, and Chinese travel agencies canceled package tours to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rare Earths&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 20, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson warned China would “take strong counter measures if the Japanese side clings obstinately to its own course and doubles its mistakes, and Japan shall bear all the consequences.” The next day, Chinese customs officials began blocking shipments to Japan of rare earths, which had previously accounted for about half of China’s global rare earth exports. In July, China announced a 72 percent cut in global rare earth export quotas. While China justified the July cut as part of its efforts to improve environmental protection and bolster domestic supply, Japan, the United States, and the European Union faced market disruptions. Chinese premier Wen Jiabao emphasized in the days before the September 21 cutoff that Japan would face consequences for potentially detaining the fishing boat captain, but after the administrative block he (and MOFCOM) denied that an embargo was in effect. Without an explicit comment or pronouncement from China of an export ban, Japan opted not to file a WTO case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arrests of Japanese Nationals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 23, Chinese state media reported that four Japanese nationals had been arrested in China’s Hebei Province on September 21 for illegally entering a military zone without proper authorization and filming military targets. The four businessmen, all employees of a Japanese construction company, were in China working for a Japanese government project to reclaim World War II–era chemical weapons left by the Japanese Imperial Army. The Japanese government stated that the incident was unrelated to the captain’s arrest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAPANESE RESPONSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 23, the Japanese prosecutor announced it was dropping the case “in consideration of the Japan-China relationship.” The fishing boat captain returned to China on September 24, accompanied by officials from China’s foreign and agriculture ministries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTERMATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 25, after the captain returned home, China’s foreign ministry demanded an apology and compensation from Japan. Japan responded that the request was “completely groundless and unacceptable.” On September 28, China lifted the de facto rare earths export ban on Japan. The day before, Japan’s trade minister stated Japan should diversify its rare earth imports. Tightened Chinese inspections of Japanese imports were eased until 2012, when a dispute between the two countries over Japan’s nationalization of the disputed islands reignited tensions. On September 30, China released three of the four arrested Japanese nationals after they admitted wrongdoing and apologized; the fourth Japanese national was released on bail on October 9. Today the islands remain a source of contention between Tokyo and Beijing, with the two countries acknowledging since 2014 that “different positions exist” on the islands’ sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Japanese Policy toward Rare Earth Supply Chains&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011, following China’s 2010 trade coercion efforts, the Japanese government announced a $1.3 billion public-private initiative on rare earths to diversify sources, develop new materials, and reduce waste. As of July 2022, Japan had decreased its domestic share of Chinese rare earth imports from 90 percent to 58 percent. It intends to reach 50 percent in the next three years. The public-private initiative also led to Japan’s 2016 rescue of Australia-based Lynas Corporation. Lynas, the only non-China rare earths producer at the time, faced major debt and was poised to collapse just one year after its sole non-China competitor, U.S.-based Molycorp, folded. Japanese entities, including state-owned JOGMEC and trading company Sojitz Corporation, slashed Lynas’ loan interest rates and extended its payment deadlines from 2018 to 2020. Today, Lynas is the world’s largest non-China producer of separated rare earth materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reappraisal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years following the 2010 incident, some questioned whether any coercion had occurred. Two studies argued that the disruption in rare earth exports observed by Japanese industry in September 2010 more likely resulted from China’s July 2010 plan to curb global exports than from the fishing vessel incident. However, the timing of the reported import slowdown clearly affected Japan’s perception of the situation, even if statistics are inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;norway-liu-xiaobo-nobel-prize-2010&quot;&gt;Norway: Liu Xiaobo Nobel Prize (2010)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 8, 2010, the Norwegian Nobel Committee, composed of five members appointed by Norway’s parliament, selected Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo as the recipient of the Nobel Peace prize. The committee selected Liu “for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China.” At the time, Liu was imprisoned in China after having been convicted in 2009 of “inciting subversion of state power.” The king and queen of Norway attended the ceremony on December 10, 2010, where Liu’s seat sat empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINESE MEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the ceremony, in November, the Chinese embassy in Oslo sent letters requesting foreign dignitaries not attend (ultimately, 19 countries did not send a representative). The day before the December 10 ceremony, China’s foreign ministry took aim at the Norwegian government, with a spokesperson stating, “By openly supporting the extremely erroneous decision by the Nobel Committee, the Norwegian Government has destroyed the political foundation and environment for cooperation in bilateral relations.” At a December 11 press conference, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Jiang Yu discussed the prize ceremony at length, further criticizing the Norwegian government. China then commenced an implicit diplomatic freeze that continued until 2016, ceasing free trade discussions and the conveyance of visas to Norwegian officials. In October 2011, the Chinese embassy in Oslo released a statement saying, “The current Sino-Norwegian relations [are] in difficulty because the Norwegian Nobel Committee granted last year’s Nobel Peace Prize to a Chinese criminal serving jail term in China, and the Norwegian Government supported this wrong decision.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salmon-Related Restrictions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 13, 2010, the Chinese government instituted new inspection and quarantine procedures for Norwegian aquaculture imports. On January 20, 2011, China’s inspection and quarantine authority released a notice to safeguard Chinese consumers by strengthening inspections and quarantines on imported salmon. Norwegian salmon fell from 94 percent of China’s salmon imports in 2010 to just 2 percent in 2016. Former diplomats also reported that Norwegian SOEs faced unjustified difficulties in obtaining contracts in China. In June 2012, a former Norwegian prime minister was denied a visa for a visit to China in what was assumed, but not explicitly confirmed, retaliation for the Nobel Peace Prize. In December 2012, China excluded Norway from a policy that allowed visa-free trips to Beijing for visitors from all 27 EU members plus Switzerland and Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NORWEGIAN RESPONSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 8, 2010, Norwegian foreign minister Jonas Gahr Stoere attempted to preempt China’s anger by emphasizing the independence of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. In June 2011, the Norwegian government reached out to China through the WTO to obtain clarification on the Chinese government’s salmon-related directives. China’s responses emphasized that the measures were not targeted at Norway specifically and that it had seen evidence of contaminants in Norwegian salmon. To bypass China’s strict and untimely salmon checks, Norwegian salmon exports to China were rerouted through Vietnam, with Norwegian salmon exports to Vietnam growing 17-fold between 2010 and 2013. In May 2013, there was speculation Norway might block China’s application for an observer seat at the Arctic Council, but China was ultimately admitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2014, high-ranking Norwegian officials explicitly declined to meet with the Dalai Lama when he visited Oslo that same month. Critics accused the Norwegian government of bowing to Chinese pressure, but the Norwegian government justified the decision to restore diplomatic relations with Beijing on the basis of advancing progress on human rights and climate change rather than a desire for economic gain. On September 11, 2014, with Chinese restrictions on salmon imports ongoing, Norway’s education ministry withdrew approval for a largely China-funded radar antenna in Svalbard, designed for research purposes, based on a holistic assessment of the technology’s potential uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTERMATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 19, 2016, Norwegian foreign minister Børge Brende visited Beijing to hold talks with Premier Li Keqiang. The two countries’ foreign ministries issued a joint statement, with Norway expressing respect for China’s “development path and social system” and promising “not to support actions that undermine [China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity].” Following Brende’s visit, China and Norway announced that bilateral relations were again normalized. In July 2018, China lifted its restrictions on Norwegian salmon. While Norwegian citizens remain excluded from China’s 72-hour and 144-hour visa-free transit policies, China agreed to resume bilateral free trade discussions in 2017. However, progress on negotiations seemed to stall in 2022. As of early 2023, the most recent talks were held in March 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;philippines-scarborough-shoal-2012&quot;&gt;Philippines: Scarborough Shoal (2012)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 10, 2012, two Chinese surveillance ships intervened to prevent a Philippine navy warship from arresting the crews of eight Chinese fishing vessels that had dropped anchor near the contested Scarborough Shoal, an island chain in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea. The motivation for the attempted arrest stemmed from the Philippine navy’s alleged discovery of illegally held aquaculture on one of the fishing boats. The incident led to a standoff between the Chinese patrol vessels and the Philippine warship. Although the warship departed on April 12, a Philippine coast guard vessel soon arrived on the scene to continue the standoff, and the two Chinese vessels were joined by a third.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINESE MEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2012, before the shoal incident, China’s import inspection and testing authority raised concerns with the Philippines regarding mealybugs in Philippine banana exports. On May 2, following the incident, the same inspection authority expressed concerns about mealybugs in Philippine papayas and pineapples, even though Philippine shipments to Japan and South Korea had reportedly been cleared without issue. On May 7, China’s vice foreign minister warned the Philippines that prolonging the shoal standoff would tarnish bilateral relations between the two nations. Two days later, the Chinese military’s official newspaper published an editorial warning against efforts to undermine China’s claims to the shoal. On May 10, China refused 1,200 containers of Philippine bananas, again over mealybug concerns, leaving the fruit to rot at customs and — according to Philippine business leaders — causing the Philippine agricultural sector to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales in a few days. At the time, China purchased more than 30 percent of Philippine banana exports. China’s enhanced quarantine measures soon extended to papayas, pineapples, and other fruits including mangoes and coconuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also on May 10, it was reported that China had paused tourism packages to the Philippines and had issued a travel advisory for its citizens traveling to Manila. At the time, Chinese tourists represented about 9 percent of Philippine tourism arrivals. On May 16, China enacted a seasonal 10-week fishing ban in the waters surrounding the Scarborough Shoal, ostensibly to limit overfishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHILIPPINE RESPONSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the days following the April 10, 2012, incident, the Philippines requested China agree to an international court adjudication of the territorial dispute. China refused. In May, the then-Philippine economic planning secretary said in response to curbs on tourism and fruit exports to China, “We are likely to see modest effects (on the economy), but we need to intensify our efforts to diversify our trade with other countries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTERMATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2012, the United States brokered an agreement to resolve the standoff. Although the Philippines withdrew as part of the resolution, Chinese vessels remained in the area in apparent violation of the deal, which a top Chinese diplomat would later claim had never existed. Beginning in July 2012, China blockaded Philippine access to the Scarborough Shoal and drove Philippine fishermen away, asserting full maritime control of the area. In September, during the fishing off-season, a Philippine coast guard surveillance flight observed Chinese marine surveillance ships and Chinese law enforcement vessels near the shoal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diplomatic Dispute&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a July 2012 ASEAN ministerial, Philippine efforts to ensure the joint communiqué reflected concerns over the 2012 shoal incident were stymied by then-chair Cambodia, a close ally of Beijing. On January 22, 2013, the Philippines unilaterally initiated proceedings at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague, challenging China’s sovereignty over the Scarborough Shoal and the legality of China’s de facto occupation of the area. In April 2013, following the appeal, officials in Beijing warned of negative ramifications for Philippine industries if the arbitration process progressed. Making good on the promise, China applied pressure on the Philippines through continued food safety accusations, which escalated into an import ban on Philippine bananas and pineapples. These measures ultimately caused a more than two-thirds decline in Philippine banana exports to China 2014 to 2016. In August 2013, China appeared to disinvite President Aquino from attending the China-ASEAN trade fair. In February 2014, Aquino called on the international community to increase support for the Philippines as it resisted China’s South China Sea policy. China issued yet another travel advisory against the Philippines in September 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hague Court Ruling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration concluded the China-Philippines case, ruling unanimously in favor of the Philippines and finding that China’s claims of sovereignty over the area bounded by the nine-dash line were invalid and unsupported and that Chinese physical obstruction of Philippine vessels in the region was unlawful. While Australia, Japan, and the United States issued a joint statement urging China to comply with the court ruling, ASEAN in its 2016 ministerial joint communiqué ignored the ruling entirely, instead calling for self-restraint and urging the negotiation of a code of conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China rejected the Hague’s legally binding court ruling, which lacked an enforcement mechanism, and continued to assert its sovereignty in the area. Following the ruling, Chinese tourist arrivals to the Philippines dropped by 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rapprochement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016 the Philippines elected a new president, Rodrigo Duterte, who as mayor of Davao City had been denied a visa to the United States for his controversial war on drugs. Duterte took office in June 2016 after promising on the campaign trail to both defend the Philippines’ territorial claims and reopen bilateral dialogue with China. As president, he went on to pursue a more aggressive pivot toward China, ultimately dismissing the Hague ruling. On a visit to Beijing in October 2016, Duterte stated that the Philippines and the United States were now separate and that a bilateral reconciliation with China was underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the October visit, China and the Philippines signed 13 bilateral agreements, with China pledging $24 billion in investments toward infrastructure, transportation, renewable energy, urban development, tourism, and more. In addition, the two leaders struck a deal allowing Philippine fishermen access to the Scarborough Shoal. Following Duterte’s visit, China-Philippine relations rapidly warmed: Philippine banana exports to China soared, and Chinese tourists returned in large numbers. However, little of China’s promised $24 billion investment ever materialized. In addition, in 2017 China expanded its presence in Scarborough Shoal and resisted Philippine efforts to build shelters on Sandy Cay near the contested Spratly Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of President Duterte’s term, it remained unclear whether China exerted de facto control over Sandy Cay, despite Duterte asserting it remained in Philippine control. In September 2022, Duterte’s successor, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., expressed interest in negotiating an agreement with China over oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea. In November 2022, U.S. vice president Kamala Harris visited the Philippine island Palawan, which borders the South China Sea and is close to the disputed Spratly Islands, in a show of support for the Philippines “in defense of international rules and norms as it relates to the South China Sea.” A week prior, the Philippines announced plans to increase the number of U.S.-Philippine joint military facilities from five to ten. Harris’s visit came just days after a Chinese and Philippine military confrontation over a piece of Chinese rocket debris that a China coast guard vessel seized from a Philippine navy ship. In addition, on February 3, 2023, Manila announced the United States would station military equipment at four more locations in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;south-korea-thaad-deployment-2016&quot;&gt;South Korea: THAAD Deployment (2016)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 8, 2016, the United States and South Korea announced an agreement to deploy the THAAD missile system in South Korea. Designed to intercept ballistic missiles, the installation was aimed at countering the growing threat posed by North Korea’s ballistic missile program. However, China opposed the deployment, raising concerns that it would undermine its nuclear deterrent by degrading its second-strike capability. Beijing also expressed concerns that the system’s radar would be able to peer deep into China’s territory. At a higher level, Beijing felt that Seoul’s decision represented a South Korean alignment with what it perceived as a U.S.-led effort to contain China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 7, 2016, the South Korean government announced it had selected land owned by Korea’s fifth-largest conglomerate, Lotte, as the installation site for the batteries. The government reached a land-swap deal with Lotte in November 2016, and United States Forces Korea delivered the THAAD system’s key components in the early morning hours of April 26, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINESE MEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s decision to pursue THAAD installation despite the PRC’s official and unofficial opposition and threats led to a series of trade restrictions and consumer boycotts on Korean imports. Beginning in August 2016, Chinese regulators imposed new restrictions on South Korean cultural exports, including movies, television shows, video games, and musical performances. In March 2017, the PRC National Tourism Administration warned Chinese citizens to “recognize the risks of outbound tourism and carefully select [their] travel destinations” following PRC allegations of Chinese nationals being “obstructed” from entering South Korea’s Jeju Island, presumably by South Korean customs or immigration officials at Jeju International Airport. That same March, the China National Tourism Administration reportedly instructed travel agencies to halt the sale of group tour packages. This came after the agency had initially urged them to curtail the number of tourists by 20 percent the October prior. The result was that Chinese visitors to South Korea — who accounted for roughly half of overseas visitors to South Korea in 2016 — dropped by more than 60 percent from March to October 2017 compared with the same period the year prior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A February 2017 editorial published in the Global Times argued that, due to WTO obligations and the PRC–South Korea free trade agreement, Chinese consumers, not the government, should act as the main forces in sanctioning Korea, and that companies like Hyundai would “face disaster sooner or later” should “PRC–South Korea conflicts continue to escalate.” The following month, South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia blamed a 52 percent year-on-year drop in March sales in China, which ultimately led to a 30 percent year-on-year drop in 2017 China sales, on low “consumer sentiment” in a joint statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 29, 2016, the PRC Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), MOST, and National Development and Reform Commission issued a joint statement announcing the government would subsidize 498 electric vehicle models, including some with batteries produced by South Korean firms LG and Samsung. However, the same day, the ministries inexplicably retracted their support for five models with these firms’ batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owing to its involvement in the THAAD land-swap deal, Lotte experienced the brunt of Beijing’s wrath through both consumer boycotts and stepped-up arbitrary inspections. As coercive pressures on Lotte intensified, the retail conglomerate found itself forced to close 87 of its 99 stores in China in response to alleged fire code violations. Chinese authorities also published a formal travel advisory against South Korea, and customs officials increased arbitrary inspections of Korean commodity imports. China largely refrained from initiating major new coercive policies after the May 2017 election of President Moon Jae-in, who had campaigned on restarting dialogue with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KOREAN RESPONSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hampered by a political crisis that culminated in the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye, Seoul initially took time to formulate its response. In March 2017, it launched a campaign to reduce export reliance on China by expanding its trade relationships with ASEAN and India. Shortly thereafter, the South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism announced measures to support the culture industry, including by expanding eligibility for subsidized loans to include companies suffering “damage from protectionism.” Seoul also filed a WTO complaint against China on March 19, though it ultimately elected not to pursue it further for fear it might hinder cooperation with Beijing over constraining North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. In April 2017, President Trump met with President Xi to clarify the U.S. position on THAAD and relieve pressure on South Korea. The following month, President Moon accepted a last-minute invitation to attend the Silk Road summit in Beijing. In July, Moon promised to extend to Korean manufacturing businesses that chose to reshore their facilities the same benefits as it gives foreign investors. South Korea’s trade minister also met with major Korean tech firms in September, reportedly recommending that Samsung’s management team review its planned $7 billion expansion in Xi’an.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dispute over THAAD thawed significantly after an October 30 speech in which South Korean foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha promulgated her government’s Three Nos policy of simultaneous opposition to additional THAAD deployment, participation in the U.S. missile defense network, and any future trilateral alliance with the U.S. and Japan. Just days before, the Moon administration had announced its plans to approve billions of dollars in new foreign direct investment from South Korean companies in China, including Samsung, as part of a “surprise package” intended to help ameliorate tensions. Moon met with Xi in November 2017 on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam, during which the two sides formally agreed to normalize relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTERMATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late October 2017, the Chinese and South Korean foreign ministries published statements agreeing to bring relations between the two countries back to normal. Although the THAAD batteries would remain in South Korea, Chinese tourism flows soon revived, Korean exports to China recovered, investment in China picked up pace, and the two governments renewed their $56 billion bilateral currency swap arrangement. Lotte, however, failed to recover from the episode and has since closed its last store in China. Following the dispute, the Moon administration unveiled its New Southern Policy, an effort to strengthen South Korea’s resilience to threats of economic coercion through trade diversification. Under President Yoon Suk Yeol, the New Southern Policy has transformed into the ABCD strategy (shorthand for Advance human capital, Build health security, Connect cultures, and Digitize Asian infrastructure), which seeks to expand South Korean economic and cultural engagement with Southeast Asia and India. Having campaigned on a promise to activate the as-yet unused THAAD system, he has also downplayed his predecessor’s Three Nos policy, saying it was “not a promise or agreement we made with China, but an explanation of our position.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mongolia-dalai-lama-visit-2016&quot;&gt;Mongolia: Dalai Lama Visit (2016)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a November 19–23, 2016, visit to Mongolia, the Dalai Lama told press that the rebirth of the Tenth Patriarch of Mongolian Buddhism, a sect of Yellow Hat Buddhism, had taken place in Mongolia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINESE MEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP views the Dalai Lama as a “splittist” who seeks Tibetan independence. China maintains that any hosting of the Dalai Lama by a foreign country constitutes interference in China’s core interests. Previously, Mongolia, due to its extensive cultural and historical ties with the leader of Tibetan Buddhism, had “ignored Chinese condemnation for Dalai Lama visits.” Prior visits in 2002 and 2006 saw China close its border and cancel flights from Beijing. Ahead of the Lama’s 2016 visit, the Chinese government urged Mongolia to deny the Lama’s visa to maintain “sound and steady ties.” Mongolia responded to Chinese warnings that the visit was a religious event and that the religious leader would not meet with government officials. In addition, the CCP’s United Front Work Department maintains a system to oversee and manage the reincarnation of Buddhist lamas. The Dalai Lama’s declaration challenged that system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On November 25, China indefinitely postponed bilateral meetings scheduled for the following week, which were set to cover soft loan negotiations and joint infrastructure projects. A week after the visit, China imposed fees and transit costs on Mongolian commodity shipments into China at a major border crossing, leading to major delays. China also canceled ongoing negotiations for a $4.2 billion loan to assist Mongolia with debt repayment. At the time, Mongolia depended on China for 84.1 percent of its exports and faced economic pressure exacerbated by currency depreciation, stark FDI downturns, and low global commodities prices. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson refused to draw a connection between the tariffs and the Dalai Lama’s visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTERMATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 21, Mongolia foreign minister Munkh-Orgil Tsend conceded, “The government feels sorry for this. . . . The Dalai Lama probably won’t be visiting Mongolia again during this administration.” In January 2017, China ceased its coercion efforts. A readout of a phone call between the two countries’ foreign ministers stated that Beijing “hoped Mongolia had taken this lesson to heart.” Tsend stated, “Mongolia . . . consistently holds that Tibet is an inseparable part of China, that the Tibet issue is China’s internal affair.” In February, the two foreign ministers met in Beijing to discuss future cooperation. Tsend reiterated that Mongolia would no longer permit visits by the Dalai Lama. However, the July presidential runoff election saw the election of the more anti-China candidate, Khaltmaagiin Battulga, who in August cast doubt on Mongolia’s commitment to its promise to prohibit visits by the Dalai Lama in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;australia-antiforeign-interference-lawcall-for-covid-19-investigation-20172020&quot;&gt;Australia: Anti–foreign Interference Law/Call for Covid-19 Investigation (2017/2020)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 7, 2017, Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull introduced legislation to Parliament aimed at countering foreign interference in Australian politics. The legislation followed the delivery of a classified Australian Security Intelligence Organization report addressing foreign influence in Australia’s political system. The anti–foreign interference bill, titled National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017, included an update to the legal definitions of treason, espionage, and sabotage; a ban on foreign political donations; and the institution of a foreign influence registry, among other measures. In a speech about the bill, Turnbull addressed media reports about interference by the CCP and vowed to target “covert, coercive or corrupting behavior.” Turnbull also explicitly referenced a 1949 speech delivered by China’s founder Mao Zedong, stating the people of Australia would “stand up.” After China’s foreign ministry criticized Turnbull’s statement, the prime minister repeated the phrase on December 9 in Mandarin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINESE MEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 12, 2018, several months after the anti–foreign interference law’s introduction, Prime Minister Turnbull acknowledged that Australia-China relations were suffering. Turnbull’s comments came the day after the Boao Forum for Asia, a major Chinese-hosted international conference, had concluded. No Australian ministers had received an invitation. Beyond Boao, contemporary media reports stated that China had instituted a broader diplomatic freeze, effectively blocking the issuance of visas to Australian diplomats by failing to issue formal invitations. The freeze extended to interactions between the Chinese government and the Australian embassy in Beijing, which took on a tone of “extreme formality.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s response also included trade restrictions. In May, a deal between China and Australian beef producers worth $500 million was halted. On May 22, the Chinese state-run outlet Global Times called for Beijing to cut imports of Australian beef and wine. On May 17, Australian wine producer Treasury Wine Estates reported its products faced heightened customs hurdles entering China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUSTRALIAN RESPONSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s anti–foreign interference law was assented to on June 29, 2018, and became law on December 10. Australia-China bilateral relations have remained on unstable ground since the dispute, and Australia continued to challenge China on several issues in the face of Beijing’s economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Further Disputes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei. Despite the threat of economic coercion, Australia again challenged China in August 2018 when it became the first country to exclude Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei’s equipment from domestic 5G infrastructure. China’s commerce ministry warned the move would have a “negative impact on the commercial interests of Chinese and Australian companies.” In February 2019, Chinese ports temporarily curbed coal imports from Australia, with ports in Dalian instituting a ban; a connection to the Huawei exclusion was posited at the time but not confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade and investment actions. Australia blocked Chinese investment in its largest gas pipeline on national security grounds in November 2018. In February 2020, Australia initiated an antidumping investigation into Chinese steel and aluminum products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Covid-19 origins investigation. In April 2020, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison again challenged China by calling for a WHO-led investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 virus. China responded by instituting import suspensions or delays of a swath of Australian products, including beef, barley, cotton, wine, timber, lobster, and coal. In June 2020, Morrison stated, “I’m never going to trade our values in response to coercion.” On November 18, 2020, a Chinese government document was “deliberately leaked” to the Australian press outlining 14 Chinese grievances against Australia. The list included reference to the anti–foreign interference legislation, the Huawei ban, a call for an independent investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 virus, and more. In December 2020 and June 2021, Australia brought cases to the WTO over Chinese measures against Australian barley and wine, respectively. China responded in June 2021 with a WTO case of its own over Australian remedial duties on several Chinese products, including railway wheels and wind towers. All three cases are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTERMATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2022, China’s diplomatic freeze toward Australia, which began in 2018 following the anti–foreign interference law’s introduction and continued in 2020 following Canberra’s calls for a Covid-19 investigation, ended when President Xi Jinping met with Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese on the sidelines of the G20. Albanese described the meeting as “warm” but stated it would not lead to an immediate resolution of the ongoing trade dispute. Albanese’s meeting with Xi was followed a month later by Australian foreign affairs minister Penny Wong’s visit to Beijing; Wong was the first Australian minister to do so in three years. It appears Australian-Chinese relations may be thawing slightly, without Canberra altering its policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;canada-meng-wanzhou-extradition-2018&quot;&gt;Canada: Meng Wanzhou Extradition (2018)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 1, 2018, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested Meng, the CFO of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. At the time, Meng was in Vancouver during a transit stop. Her arrest was prompted by a U.S. warrant on charges of financial fraud linked to the company’s alleged efforts to evade Iran sanctions and set up an extradition battle in the Canadian courts. The Chinese government considered the arrest an infringement on Meng’s rights, an abuse of the extradition treaty between the United States and Canada, and a politically motivated attack on a major Chinese company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINESE MEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Meng’s arrest, Beijing made diplomatic protests demanding the United States and Canada “correct their wrong behavior” and free Meng. On December 8, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Canada’s ambassador in Beijing and warned his country would face “grave consequences” if Meng were not released. Within a week, Chinese authorities had detained two Canadian citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, on charges of “engaging in activities that endanger China’s national security.” Although Beijing officially denied any connection with Meng’s extradition case, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry later linked the two cases by suggesting the release of Meng could lead to the release of the detained Canadians. A month after the arrest of the two Michaels, an appeals court in Dalian made the unusual decision to increase the drug smuggling sentence of Canadian citizen Robert Schellenberg from 15 years imprisonment to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 15, 2019, China released a statement advising against travel to Canada, resulting in a precipitous decline of Chinese immigration and tourism visa applications. In March 2019, China revoked the import licenses of two of Canada’s leading canola exporters, leading to a 70 percent decline in Canada’s annual canola seed exports to China. According to one study, the combined effect of lost business and lower prices cost Canadian canola producers between C$1.54 billion and C$2.35 billion from March 2019 to July 2020. Canada is the world’s largest canola seed exporter, and in 2018 China imported 94 percent of its canola seeds from Canada, accounting for 35 percent of Canada’s total exports of the commodity. To make up for the foregone supply, Chinese buyers increased canola seed purchases from Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and Ukraine. Beijing also curbed imports of Canadian peas and soybeans, while Canadian pork shipments encountered new administrative barriers in Chinese ports. The initial measures against Canadian pork and beef were expanded in June to include a suspension of all Canadian meat exports after inspectors allegedly found falsified customs certificates. China only lifted the ban on Canadian pork in November 2019 in response to a devastating African swine flu outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANADIAN RESPONSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the arrest of the two Michaels, the Canadian government issued a travel advisory citing the risk of subjective law enforcement faced by visitors to China. On December 22, Ottawa launched an international campaign to free Kovrig and Spavor, with the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, and Australia all issuing statements in support. In July, the Canadian agriculture minister announced new investment support packages for the country’s pork, grain, and oilseed industries aimed at helping domestic exporters find new markets. In August 2020, it was reported that crop shortages had boosted the price of Canada’s canola seed exports despite China’s coercive measures and that China continued to import Canadian canola indirectly through third countries. In July 2021, the WTO agreed to establish a panel at Canada’s request to examine China’s use of import barriers without having provided adequate scientific evidence of their stated rationale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTERMATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing finally released Kovrig and Spavor on September 24, 2021, as part of a U.S.-Canada-China diplomatic swap for Meng. Although Meng had been released on bail and kept under house arrest since December 2018, it was not until September 25, 2021 — after her lawyers had brokered a deferred prosecution agreement with U.S. officials in which Meng accepted some responsibility for the fraud claims against Huawei — that Canadian authorities allowed her to return to China. When the requested WTO dispute panel convened that same month, Chinese and Canadian officials shared they had agreed to open additional communication and to allow for an arbitrator to rule on potential appeals of the resulting panel report. In May 2022, Beijing finally lifted its three-year ban on imports from Richardson Oilseed and Viterra, Canada’s two largest canola producers. Ottawa requested the suspension of the WTO dispute settlement panel in August 2022, and as of October 2022 the bilateral canola trade appeared to have rebounded, with monthly shipments to China up 21 percent year-on-year. Canada has not softened its stance toward China following the dispute. In December 2022, Canadian foreign minister Mélanie Joly stated, “We will challenge China when it comes to international order being respected.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lithuania-taiwanese-representative-office-2021&quot;&gt;Lithuania: Taiwanese Representative Office (2021)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2021, Taiwan announced it would open a TRO in Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius. Although Taiwan maintains representative offices in other countries, including the United States, all other offices operate under the name Taipei in lieu of Taiwan, meaning the Vilnius office challenged an established norm. Under a center-right government formed after the October 2020 elections, Lithuania had taken other actions against China, including postponing a Beijing-supported deep-water port project, withdrawing from the 17+1 initiative, banning a Chinese state-controlled company from supplying Lithuanian airports with X-ray scanners, and amending laws to exclude “unreliable” digital telecommunications manufacturers and suppliers from Lithuania’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINESE MEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2021, following the TRO announcement, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office warned Lithuania “not to ‘send the wrong signals to Taiwan independence forces.’” On August 10, Beijing demanded Lithuania recall its ambassador to China, promising to withdraw its own ambassador from Lithuania as well. That same month, China reportedly ceased providing permits for Lithuanian food imports. Freight from China’s state-owned rail operator CRCT to Lithuania also ceased, though Chinese state media denied that an order had been relayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also reported in August that China had pressured U.S.-based Thermo Fisher Scientific, a major investor in Lithuania, to lobby Vilnius to reconsider its plan. In September, Lithuanian media reported that domestic companies in timber, grain, and other industries were encountering difficulties renewing and closing contracts with Chinese partners to purchase raw materials. In November, just before the TRO opened, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson stated, “The Lithuanian side shall be responsible for all the ensuing consequences.” Soon after the TRO opened on November 18, China downgraded its diplomatic relations with Lithuania and further restricted trade, effectively instituting an embargo, with Lithuania disappearing from China’s custom’s list. Customs data showed that trade in goods from Lithuania to China dropped 90 percent month-on-month and year-on-year. In December, the president of a major Lithuanian trade association said 60 companies were having trouble exporting products to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LITHUANIAN RESPONSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2022, amid ongoing pressure, Lithuania’s government blocked its state-owned rail operator from contracting with a Chinese-owned Spanish bridge-building company due to national security concerns. In late January, the European Union, of which Lithuania is a member, lodged a complaint at the WTO over China’s de facto embargo. Following the European Union’s request for consultation, China officially suspended imports of Lithuanian beef, milk, and beer without presenting cause. Also in January, German companies began to pressure Lithuania after China began blocking German imports over Lithuanian components, prompting the German-Baltic Chamber of Commerce to request that Lithuania seek a “constructive solution.” Lithuanian president Gitanas Nausėda admitted that the TRO name issue had been a mistake but did not call for a name change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lasers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Lithuania’s exports to China only accounted for around 1 percent of total exports prior to the restrictions, the slowdown had an outsized effect on Lithuania’s export-oriented industrial and scientific laser sector. Lithuania produces about 50 percent of the world’s ultrashort scientific lasers, and China accounts for 30 percent of the country’s total laser exports to manufacturing customers. After restricting imports from Lithuania, lasers produced in other countries, including Germany, France, the United States, and the Netherlands, were substituted in, hurting the Lithuanian industry’s competitiveness. Apart from its economic importance, the laser industry is also a politically influential industry in Lithuania that enjoys popular support for its work with the Lithuanian military and NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTERMATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s apparent embargo against Lithuania led to vocal support and investment commitments from Taiwan, the United States, and the European Union. For example, in January 2022, Taiwan announced it would establish a $200 million fund for investment in Lithuania, stating laser technology as a priority. However, it was unclear how much funding had reached Lithuanian firms by the end of 2022. That said, more recent reporting indicates that Taiwan remains committed to aiding Lithuanian firms. Despite acknowledgement from the Lithuanian government that China’s aggressive reaction to the TRO was unanticipated, Vilnius has not shifted its stance. Along with requesting consultation at the WTO (the case is ongoing), the European Union has fast-tracked its proposed ACI — a framework designed to deter coercion through engagement and, as a last resort, to retaliate with restrictions. While Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 shifted attention away from the dispute, Lithuania has remained close to Taiwan, with Foreign Minister Ingrida Šimonytė saying, “I don’t know whether this is something that, you know, that China can dictate.” In October 2022, Lithuania and Japan upgraded their diplomatic ties and launched a security dialogue. In November 2022, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz made oblique reference to Lithuania during a trip to Beijing, saying, “Economic measures against individual EU member states are directed against the entire EU single market.” Also in November, the head of the TRO in Vilnius stated Taiwan would invest around €10 million in Lithuanian company Teltonika to develop Lithuania’s semiconductor manufacturing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case - Japan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese prosecutors quickly dropped the legal case against the Chinese fishing boat captain and authorized his release, but Tokyo did not give in to demands to apologize or compensate China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s alleged restrictions of rare earth exports to Japan kickstarted a concerted policy effort to develop new sources of rare earth supply and rare earth substitutes for Japanese industry that continues to the present. Meanwhile, Japan has continued to exert its jurisdiction over contested areas of the East China Sea. In 2012 the Japanese government angered China by purchasing the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. Although the move may have been intended to prevent hardliners in Japan from developing the islands, Japan continues to exercise administrative control, and the United States has since affirmed the disputed islands are covered under Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan defense treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall assessment - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s loss of faith in China as a supplier of rare earths galvanized a decade-long push to reduce its exposure and create alternative sources of production across the supply chain. Although expensive and time-consuming, this effort seems to have succeeded at significantly reducing China’s share of Japanese rare earth imports and opening new opportunities for Europe and the United States to follow suit. Despite veiled threats to curtail rare earth exports in subsequent years, China has so far refrained from doing so. While Japan acknowledges “different positions exist” on the Senkaku/Diaoyu ownership question, it continues to exercise de facto control over the islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case - Norway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite China’s informal import restrictions, exports of Norwegian salmon continued to find their way to China via third countries such as Vietnam. Norway continued to affirm the Nobel committee’s independence, and while declining to meet with the Dalai Lama, Norwegian officials canceled the Chinese-funded research antenna in Svalbard. The joint statement on normalization of relations struck a conciliatory tone but may be merely symbolic. It took six years for China to extract. Norway never issued the apology China demanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since China has removed its salmon import restrictions and certain visa rules targeting Norway, relations between the two countries have warmed somewhat, with Norway and China in ongoing negotiations on a bilateral free trade agreement. However, given the apparent ease with which Norway’s salmon industry adapted to Beijing’s controls, the direct causal link between China’s coercive tactics and subsequent détente is ambiguous. Although Norway did not officially ban Huawei, it opted to contract with Erickson for its 5G network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall assessment - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall effectiveness of China’s coercion campaign is mixed. Norway’s domestic salmon producers appear to have largely circumvented the trade controls, but Beijing’s strong negative response destabilized the relationship and may have induced some nominal concessions from Oslo. However, it is difficult to contribute those minor concessions directly to China’s economic coercion. In fact, the possibility of restarting negotiations on the free trade agreement and restoring diplomatic channels of communication may have asserted a stronger pull on Norwegian officials than the ineffective trade restrictions. The concessions seem largely symbolic and did not deter Norway from choosing a provider other than Huawei for its 5G networks. The free trade negotiations may now be stalling due to Norwegian concerns about China’s intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case - Philippines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Win&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China prevented the arrest of the Chinese crew members and ultimately gained control of the Scarborough Shoal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2016 Hague ruling undermined the international standing of China’s South China Sea claims, but since it was unenforceable, the Scarborough Shoal remains under Chinese control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall assessment - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed win&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines is deepening its economic ties with China. China has successfully increased its holdings throughout the South China Sea, though it does not maintain exclusive control. The 2016 Hague ruling has not reshaped the South China Sea status quo. More recently, the Philippines announced it would be deepening its military cooperation with the United States by allowing the U.S. military access to more bases on Philippine territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case - South Korea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The South Korean government agreed to the Three Nos, but the THAAD deployments remained in place. Trade between Korea and China actually increased during this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic coercion contributed to a decline in the Korean public’s perception of China. President Moon initiated the New Southern Policy to decrease economic dependence on China. President Yoon campaigned on a more hawkish China policy and has insinuated that his administration may not continue to abide by the Three Nos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall assessment - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China failed to compel South Korea to renege on its agreement to allow the United States to deploy the THAAD missile systems. The concession in the form of the Three Nos that China did extract from Korea may not outlast the Yoon administration. In the long term, the United States succeeded in deploying the missile systems, which remain in place, while China damaged its image with the Korean public and further incentivized the Moon administration to decrease Korea’s economic dependence on China via the New Southern Policy, a policy the Yoon administration seems set to continue, if under a different name. China’s bullying behavior also pushed Korea into greater strategic alignment with the United States, a grave strategic error given that in the 2000s there were conversations in Seoul about deepening the relationship with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case - Mongolia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed win&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mongolia quickly conceded to Beijing’s demands after the visit took place, with a Mongolian minister quoted as saying, “Mongolia firmly supports the one China policy, consistently holds that Tibet is an inseparable part of China, that the Tibet issue is China’s internal affair.” However, China’s threats of economic coercion in the run-up to the visit were insufficient to prevent the visit from happening in the first place. Likewise, President Battulga quickly raised doubts about Mongolia’s commitment to never allowing a future visit by the Dalai Lama after his election in July 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed win&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic coercion likely contributed to the election of President Battulga in July 2017, the more anti-China candidate. However, Battulga was barred from a second term due to changes to the Mongolian constitution, and his successor Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh has sought engagement with Beijing. On November 27–28, 2022, Xi Jinping received Khurelsukh for a state visit, where the two leaders issued the Joint Statement on Advancing the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in the New Era between the People’s Republic of China and Mongolia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall assessment - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed win&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic coercion partially achieved its objective. Mongolia still allowed the visit to happen but quickly apologized. Likewise, though Mongolia has made good on its promise not to invite the Dalai Lama back, President Battulga’s comments raise questions about the commitment’s long-term resilience. Although there have been reports Mongolia is trying to distance itself from China, this does not seem attributable to the case of coercion but instead larger structural forces. Moreover, a November 2022 state visit and deepening bilateral economic relationship suggest Mongolian-Chinese relations are improving, not deteriorating. But, again, there are larger structural forces driving this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case - Australia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither China’s threats of coercive action nor its implemented controls on Australian imports appear to have swayed Australian policy or political rhetoric in a direction favorable to Beijing. Recent reporting suggests that China may be backing down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia has responded to China’s economic coercion campaign by persisting in its offending policy positions (the Huawei 5G ban, the anti–foreign influence law, calls for an investigation of the origins of the Covid-19 virus) while more closely aligning itself with the United States through plurilateral partnerships such as the Quad and AUKUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall assessment - &lt;strong&gt;Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The China-Australia trade dispute is still ongoing at the time of writing, but Beijing’s attempts to squeeze Australian imports have thus far failed to extract meaningful policy concessions. If anything, Beijing’s actions appear to have backfired by causing a hardening of attitudes both among policymakers in Canberra and the Australian public, with a more widespread perception taking hold of China as a strategic threat. Now it appears China may even be attempting to improve relations without Canberra backing down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case - Canada&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian authorities released Meng after the U.S. Justice Department agreed to defer judgment in exchange for Meng entering a “statement of facts,” in which she effectively admitted responsibility without pleading guilty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada later banned Huawei from its 5G networks, and in December 2022, the Canadian foreign minister stated, “We will challenge China when it comes to international order being respected.” The Canadian public’s perception of China also fell sharply after Meng’s arrest and China’s retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall assessment - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada and the United States have insisted politics did not interfere in the case. However, deferred judgments are reportedly rare when the defendant is a high-profile individual. This could indicate the United States felt its case was weak or that it simply hoped to relieve pressure on Canada. Nevertheless, Meng’s statement of facts could still be used in a future case against Huawei, and it seems China’s hostage taking, rather than its coercive economic measures, had the greatest political effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case - Lithuania&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lithuanian president conceded the name change may have been a mistake. The German-Baltic Chamber of Commerce, along with the German auto parts firm Continental, pressured Vilnius to change the name, and the Lithuanian laser industry was broadly unhappy with the decision. However, the name of the representative office remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithuania had been trending more hawkish toward China prior to the naming incident. Although a survey conducted several months after the name change showed a majority of Lithuanians disagreed with Vilnius’ decision, China’s aggressive response accelerated EU support for the ACI, ironically refocusing a policy debate that had its origins in the Trump administration’s trade policy. China’s coercion of Lithuania has also raised Lithuania’s profile in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall assessment - &lt;strong&gt;Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s coercion prompted the Lithuanian president to express regret. However, in the Lithuanian political system, the president has little power and, unlike the prime minister, is directly elected, making the office more beholden to public opinion. Interestingly, public opinion in Lithuania seemed opposed to the decision to provocatively name the representative office. That said, the Lithuanian government has expressed opposition to authoritarian systems, informed in part by Lithuania’s history as a Soviet republic, and it is doubtful China’s coercion has done anything to bolster Lithuanian perceptions of China. Should the European Union adopt the ACI, this would represent a rare speedy adoption of a major piece of policy by the commission.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;區諾軒對多名參選人「政治表態」感無奈、若被DQ會「白費好多人心機」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（20日）踏入審訊第28天。區諾軒今開始接受代表何桂藍的大狀盤問，同意依賴功能組別才能取得立會過半，而民主派要勝出該界別很困難、該界別亦不會違背業界利益投票，但組織者從沒討論如何爭取他們支持。區諾軒同意辯方指，戴耀廷將立會過半形容為「大殺傷力憲制武器」是「有缺陷（flawed）」，因民主派一致投票僅是戴耀廷的假設，而非各人「共同願景」，重申戴耀廷「盲點」是沒看到功能組別真正想法。區亦同意，若立會無法過半，功能組別和建制派阻礙民主派議案的格局將維持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒被邀協調初選-指曾任民陣召集人較中立能與各派交涉&quot;&gt;區諾軒被邀協調初選 指曾任民陣召集人、較中立、能與各派交涉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今開始接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問。Beel 先由2020年1月底的飯局問起，區確認，當初由李永達致電聯絡他出席，指將有立法會選舉，民主派要進行協調工作，問他「會唔會考慮出嚟傾吓」。Beel 問為何會選區諾軒協助協調？區承認當時他們曾考慮或邀請其他人選，而準則是望找一些不屬任何黨派、較中立的人士，可以與不同派系交涉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問區有何相關的背景或技巧。區指他曾為民主黨黨員、接替被取消資格的周庭參選立法會以及擔任民陣召集人，而民陣工作正正是在辦遊行或商討議題上與不同派系周旋，他過往的政治經歷令他有條件與不同派系交涉，該背景亦是他與李永達溝通時被李所認同。Beel 一度問區有否經驗建立「揀選候選人」的機制，惟區指描述不完全準確，更正為「建立一個機制去令到市民揀候選人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指飯局曾討論各區議席目標35係門檻35係目標&quot;&gt;區諾軒指飯局曾討論各區議席目標：35係門檻，35+係目標&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區承認，該次飯局是首次與戴耀廷見面，但此前已認識亦尊重他，同意出於禮貌和尊重，不會公開表達對戴的反對。區同意，飯局最初的目標是爭取民主派立會過半，有討論各選區取得「6 6 4 4 3」的議席，加上功能組別民主派現有議席，再贏多3到5席就能獲得35席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問飯局上是討論爭取35席抑或35+席，區指是後者，指「35係門檻，35+係目標」。Beel 續指，戴耀廷2019年12月的文章題為「立會奪半 走向真普選重要一步」，即爭取35席，故在飯局提及要35+，是更進一步？惟區指，雖然文章只提及「立會奪半」，但戴是「包含埋奪半底下一個質性上嘅意義」，即認為民主派奪半有「本質上的意義轉變」，亦提及作為多數派可以運用不同權力。區又指，「立會奪半一定唔只係35就完㗎」，強調民主派作為一個派別「參與選舉梗係要爭取最大嘅勝算啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意依賴功能組別取得立會過半-但組織者不曾詳細討論相關問題&quot;&gt;區同意依賴功能組別取得立會過半 但組織者不曾詳細討論相關問題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，若民主派只獲得35個議席，是否會陷入兩難，即要麼不選主席，要麼只餘下34票（因主席不能就預算案投票）？區答「所以一路都話，係民主派攞唔攞到多數議席嘅問題」，並在法官陳仲衡詢問下同意，在計劃期間沒有討論過民主派會否競逐立會主席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，在2016年立法會選舉，民主派地方直選和功能組別分別有18和7至9席，並需分別增至23席和13席才能取得立會過半，而飯局上雖有提過功能組別要贏取的議席數目，「但唔係重點。Beel 問，但他們應很依賴功能組別來取得過半議席？區同意，但指功能組別始終有太多不同界別，當時亦不清楚有誰會參選，「所以唔係一啲喺當時可以處理嘅事項。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，那在整個計劃期間，組織者之間有否討論如何爭取足夠的功能組別議席？區承認「冇認真地坐低詳細討論功能組別嘅問題，但喺戴耀廷嘅推算裡面，係有包括功能組別嘅因素在內」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒民主派勝出功能組別從來都難功能組別一向不會違背業界利益投票&quot;&gt;區諾軒：民主派勝出功能組別從來都難、功能組別一向不會違背業界利益投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示區諾軒4月帖文〈【功能組別 - 終極之戰】最後一個月，召喚所有BR人士搶攻〉，區籲「體育、演藝、文化及出版界」及「進出口界」的公司登記做選民。區同意當時留意到成為該兩個界別的選民門檻較低，而選民登記將截止，故籲市民登記以增加民主派在功能組別的勝算。Beel 提及，出版界的「三聯、商務、中華」有很多附屬公司但不屬民主派，區同意。Beel 並指出，因此要在該些功能界別爭取議席以取得立會過半是很困難（uphill battle），區答：「民主派勝出功能組別從來都難。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，另一困難是即使有足夠功能組別議席，但也不能要求他們按想要的方式投票。區指這是戴耀廷關心的問題，而「我從來都話，唔應該綑綁其他人當選後嘅工作」。Beel 續指，要求功能組別議員否決預算案，就像要求火雞支持過聖誕一樣（like turkeys voting for Christmas；意即「作出違背個人利益的決定」），因他們並不會違背業界利益。區指這是功能組別議員一直有的現象。區亦同意，不綑綁參選人否決是他辦初選的初心，亦同意有民主派當選後或不想否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指一致投票僅戴耀廷假設非共同願景-大殺傷力憲制武器概念有缺陷&quot;&gt;區指一致投票僅戴耀廷假設非共同願景 「大殺傷力憲制武器」概念有「缺陷」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，那區諾軒曾否想過，戴耀廷提出立會過半作為「大殺傷力憲制武器」，其實一開始就是有缺陷的（flawed from the outset）？即使作為「武器」，也只是「射空彈（firing blanks）」？區反問其意思是否「民主派現實上唔太可能一齊做到呢件事」，法官李運騰補充，Beel 的問題是若冷靜坐下來認真想想，便會立即發覺整個計劃都是不切實際（unrealistic）的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區回應，在3月的初選記者會，戴耀廷就運用否決權一事僅指不同人有不同想法，當時是「未傾得清楚」、「不經整合」，而後來戴耀廷的「盲點」是「冇睇到功能組別嘅人真正諗緊啲咩」。李運騰反問，但整個「35+計劃」之所以能實現，最基本不是假設民主派議員會作為一個整體投票嗎（will vote as one body）？區指這是戴耀廷提及「大殺傷力憲制武器」的假設。李問，但那不是各參與者的共同願景（common vision）？區再指「我認為大家係唔共同嘅」，並指若是共同，就不會出現協調會上的不同意見，之後6月亦有另一發展。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，他與戴耀廷辦初選的目標不同，他只想爭取立會過半，而戴則想更進一步，並在飯局提及立會過半作為「大殺傷力憲制武器」。Beel 再次問，區當時是否會發覺那概念是「有缺陷（flawed）」的？區答：「可以話係有瑕疵嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區承認組織者無討論如何爭取功能組別同意否決預算案當時的確冇關心&quot;&gt;區承認組織者無討論如何爭取功能組別同意否決預算案：當時的確冇關心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒其後同意，他與趙家賢「幾乎冇」就爭取功能組別支持的困難討論，只是就初選行政事務交流。至於戴耀廷，他們曾考慮是否讓社會福利界、教育界和衞生服務界參與初選，但只是對爭取的功能組別議席數量（13席）有「評估（assessment）」，並互相知會大約有什麼人出選，「但係冇詳細討論過點樣拎13席返嚟」，亦無討論背後困難。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 一度指，區諾軒主要集中在協調地區直選，區指「唔單止」，因他始終有參與沈旭暉的功能組別交流會。區並指，要爭取13席，即目標要從建制派手上贏取4席，相關參選人士包括進出口界林景楠、工程界黃偉信、批發及零售界張秀賢、飲食界林瑞華，他於6月尾得知周小龍有意參選體育、演藝、文化及出版界，建築、測量、都市規劃及園境界亦有人參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，故如何讓功能組別參選人同意否決預算案的議題曾否被組織者討論，抑或被放在一旁？區承認「當時的確冇關心」。Beel 再問，那他們有否預期有落選者會繼續報名參選立會？區指有預期，故設立了機制，如有人違反「就唔會得到35+嘅支持」，但區也同意不能阻止人參選，因此行為屬違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒預期立會無法過半-功能組別及建制派阻礙民主派議格局將維持&quot;&gt;區諾軒預期立會無法過半 功能組別及建制派阻礙民主派議格局將維持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後展示區諾軒於3月11日發表的文章〈暫別前，只想一齊贏一次（一）〉，提及民主陣營本身主張已有根本分歧，難以要求各派承諾什麼。區同意當時他對能否在立會奪半有疑惑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章續提到「功能組別壟斷立法會的格局，是回歸以來中共、港共一再僭越多數人意願的手段」。區解釋，功能組別投票基礎不夠廣闊，但在立會卻坐擁分組點票優勢，即議員提出的議案須地區直選和功能組別均取得過半數才能通過，以致過往大多數市民支持的政策，由議員提案後都會遭功能組別分組點票否決。區同意辯方指，功能組別是阻礙了地區直選議員的意願，而議會上三分一的建制派亦經常阻礙民主派提出的議案。Beel 問，他亦預期2020年立法會將發生同樣情況？區同意，指特別是立會無法過半，格局將會維持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章續提及，「推動立法會過半，是謀求改變吃人的格局」，區解釋，當時正值反修例運動，而過往立法會的確有很多由建制派提出的議案違反很多港人意願，故他形容是「吃人的格局」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DOL7j08.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（20日）踏入審訊第28天。區諾軒繼續接受盤問，表示參與者對否決預算案有不同意見，惟戴耀廷卻「側埋一邊」，不斷撰文提倡用否決權及「攬炒十步」，是「有問題」亦不尊重與會者意見。法官陳慶偉問戴的做法是否「不民主」，區重申對新東文件使用「會運用」否決權字眼感「好費解」，亦對新西文件採用「會運用」字眼「後知後覺」，難以接受過程是民主，還柙期間收到新西會議謄本亦「好難受」。他又指，從政以來一直「求同存異」、尋找「最大公因數」，但初選後期「似乎變成一派拉倒一派」，反問：「作為組織者，難道唔係要做一個中立仲裁嘅人咩？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指戴耀廷寫文章從不與組織者商討側埋一邊講否決權不尊重與會者意見&quot;&gt;區指戴耀廷寫文章從不與組織者商討、「側埋一邊」講否決權不尊重與會者意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒繼續接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問，同意依賴功能組別才能取得立會過半，而民主派要勝出該界別很困難、該界別不會違背業界利益投票，但組織者從沒詳細討論如何爭取他們支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問及，區諾軒在3月時曾否與戴耀廷談及達成「35+」計劃可能遇到的問題或障礙（pitfalls or obstacles），法官李運騰補充即包括功能組別出於業界利益或不會否決預算案。區指就投票的問題，當時是「從來冇討論過」，並一邊搖頭一邊用力說：「特別係戴耀廷出文章嘅時候，我覺得有個好大嘅問題就係，佢從來唔會搵我哋啲組織者去傾。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，35+的基本假設，是民主派運用否決權迫使政府回應訴求，但區當時已發現計劃的問題，即功能組別或不會否決預算案，而這會令計劃失敗。區同意當時已看到該問題，「所以我對於個計劃嘅理解，同戴耀廷對於個計劃嘅理解，係有差異嘅。」李問他有否與戴談及？區指他最初沒有關心該議題，是直至5月5日第二次新東會議後才首次與戴有衝突，因當時參與者會上出現分歧，故即使區一直認為運用憲制權力否決預算案沒理由違法，「但冇可能讓到唔同嘅聲音不被尊重。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區並指，「更何況係佢（戴耀廷）4月份出嘅幾篇文章」，包括〈真攬炒十步〉。區指，最初覺得一個人寫文章是「文責自負」，但當看到參與者有不同意見，「而佢側埋一邊，不斷地去講話要用否決權呢，仲要發展咗一個十部曲嘅觀點，我認為喺組織工作上面係有問題嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，故當時戴耀廷不純粹是一個協調者（facilitator），而是有所提倡（proposing something）？區同意。李再問，戴是將計劃帶領向一個方向（steering the scheme to one direction）？區同意。區重申，是5月5日新東會議後才第一次向戴耀廷指出計劃問題，而戴一直指「合法冇問題」。陳慶偉指，這與區是沒有矛盾的，因區也認為是合法，區同意，「但係喺尊唔尊重與會者唔同意見上面呢，我認為佢係做得唔啱嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問戴不理他人意見是否不民主-區休庭後認過程有不民主之處&quot;&gt;官問戴不理他人意見是否「不民主」 區休庭後認過程有不民主之處&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指那是另一範疇，但就計劃的方向而言，二人並無矛盾。區續指，戴耀廷在很多次協調會議「都好在意講佢對於否決權嘅睇法」，且無論與會者立場為何，也嘗試用「會積極運用」字眼迎合。區指他不關心亦沒有這樣做，亦因協調會上不同意見無特別採取任何行動，是直至新東會議出現較鮮明的矛盾才向戴「提出異議」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉表示理解，並指35+作為一個促進民主的計劃，戴耀廷試圖將計劃引向一個特定方向、不理其他人意見的做法似乎是「不民主」（acting undemocratic）的，林卓廷、陳志全、施德來等發笑。區猶豫片刻沒有回應，陳問「還是我是錯的？（Or am I wrong？）」，區指「我要好謹慎咁答」，多人發笑，陳慶偉着他休庭後再回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區對新東文件用會運用感好費解見新西會議謄本感好難受&quot;&gt;區：對新東文件用「會運用」感「好費解」、見新西會議謄本感「好難受」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒在休庭後表示，記得戴耀廷在6月9日記者會曾強調「我哋組織者冇偏埋一邊」。區續指想大家回顧有關新東會議的過程：「我到而家都……對於份文件最後用『會運用』感到好費解，如果佢見到與會者嘅矛盾，而佢又有建議過『會積極運用』，點解到最後會出咗『會運用』？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，雖然他沒有出席新西5月8日的會議，但還柙期間與所有被告收到新西會議的文字謄本，「我覺得好難受，因為個過程我正正係覺得有唔民主嘅地方。」區指，戴耀廷只是「好簡單」向組織者交待該次會議，在開會後致電他稱「新界西同新界東差唔多，但嗰分別係要4萬8千人投票啫」，此外沒有其他內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區解釋，戴指新西參與者認為要起碼有4萬8千人參與初選投票才會承認結果，若不夠票數就只作參考；但戴沒解釋新西和新東的相似性，亦沒有提及新西共識是採用「會運用」，區是直至6月19日參選人報名時夾附額外聲明，才首次知悉新西協議寫「會運用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱從政要求同存異找最大公因數-但初選後期似乎變成一派拉倒一派&quot;&gt;區稱從政要求同存異、找最大公因數 但初選後期「似乎變成一派拉倒一派」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，6月14日與時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻正煩惱九龍東「兵變」問題，最後只能被動接受，而戴就在群組表示同意，並補充新西都會提交額外聲明。區指，當時戴已曾開新西會議，「佢係知道佢哋會咁做架啦一早，而佢亦都知道，當用到『會運用』嘅時候，即使新界西嘅人同意都好，我唔會同意，其他區嘅人亦都有唔同嘅意見。」區並指，「以上嘅過程，我到而家都係後知後覺，我好難接受嗰過程，可以叫做民主。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，但民主有時也是一個「互相讓步（give and take）」的過程，實際上不認為能在某件事上達到一致的聲音，始終要做一個決定，即使不會令所有人滿意。區續指，「喺我從政唔同嘅階段裏面，一路話畀我聽，要求同存異，搵共識要搵最大公因數。但初選去到後期，似乎變成一派拉倒一派。而作為組織者，難道唔係要做一個中立仲裁嘅人咩？」陳慶偉表示明白，並指區的立場與戴可能有不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gddospG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（20日）踏入審訊第28天。區諾軒繼續接受代表何桂藍的大狀盤問，同意擔心候選人因表明否決預算案而被DQ，故「參選人應該小心言行」，惟2020年6月越來越多候選人作「政治表態」，他「感到好無奈」，認為若DQ會「白費好多人嘅心機」。對於戴耀廷主張政府不回應「五大訴求」才否決預算案，區認為視乎政府能否「釋出善意」，不過法官李運騰指政府有否「回應」是由議員而非35+組織者決定，因議員進入議會後組織者便很難控制他們。辯方同意，指本案謀劃是「空洞（hollow）」的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱無份草擬35計劃文件-惟呢份文件冇唔高興&quot;&gt;區稱無份草擬「35+計劃文件」 惟「呢份文件冇唔高興」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒繼續接受代表何桂藍的大狀 Trevor Beel 盤問。Beel 就取消候選資格（DQ）發問，被問到2020年1月的飯局有否談及DQ問題，區指「冇印象」，但表示自2016年開始，民主派參選立法會也有一定風險被取消資格，故爭取立會過半無可避免要預計有替補機制。區與戴耀廷其後在作為試點的九東協調會議提及此問題，頭兩次會議亦主力圍繞替補機制討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示「35+計劃」文件，區同意文件由戴耀廷準備，在九東首次會議上傳閱，文件上有提及替補機制。區同意，他與趙家賢均「冇份參與草擬」文件，於會議上才首次看到。Beel 問，區對戴沒有諮詢二人下就準備這份重要的文件，有否被激怒或生氣？區指「呢份文件冇唔高興」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱擔心候選人因表明否決財案被dq認為參選人應小心言行&quot;&gt;區稱擔心候選人因表明否決財案被DQ、認為參選人應小心言行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，區當時認為候選人被 DQ 的主要原因是什麼，會否認為情況沒完沒了（ad infinitum）。法官陳慶偉關注與案件的關係，及證人能否回答，法官李運騰改為問，組織者曾否想過即使有替補的人，也可能出於同樣原因被DQ。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區表示，最初大家包括他在內也是「心存樂觀」，因區議會選舉大部分民主派參選人也沒有被DQ。但到了大約6月開始，有輿論表示若表明妄顧後果地否決預算案，會被視為不尊重《基本法》、有被DQ風險，區指當時擔心若有候選人作相關言論會被DQ。Beel 指區議會和立法會的情況不同，但區認為兩者情況相近，並指「民主派亦都應該有汲取教訓」，因早在2016年已有本土派人士被DQ，故「參選人應該小心言行」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱對6月越來越多候選人作政治表態感無奈若被dq白費咗好多人心機&quot;&gt;區稱對6月越來越多候選人作政治表態感無奈：若被DQ白費咗好多人心機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，那區認為DQ的問題是否爭取立會過半無法移除的障礙？區指，初選參選人被DQ「係會令到民主派部署出現好大混亂」，「所以當6月份越嚟越多候選人去作出政治表態呢，我感到好無奈」，何桂藍一度「O嘴」。區並指「若果用咁多心機準備初選，到頭嚟候選人被取消資格，白費咗好多義工，好多人嘅心機」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，但據當時替補機制，若有人被DQ會有人替補，區同意。Beel 一度問，但替補者與被DQ者應有類似的立場？惟陳慶偉指問題沒有需要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱各區均決定辦公民投票指戴耀廷fb發文前從來唔會問我哋&quot;&gt;區稱各區均決定辦公民投票、指戴耀廷FB發文前「從來唔會問我哋」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後引戴耀廷3月的 Facebook 帖文，提及民主派討論立會奪半安排有三個可考慮方案，包括「初選」、「排名加棄選」及「棄選」。Beel 問，戴耀廷在發文前有沒有與他商討不同方案？區略激動道：「戴耀廷擺上 Facebook 之前從來唔會問我哋嘅」，鄒家成、施德來、柯耀林等多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區確認，沒有就帖文與戴耀廷討論，但文中三個方案都有在各區會議討論，而九東亦一度採用「棄選」，即不搞初選、只進行民意調查，若得不到足夠支持就公開宣布停止選舉工程。區並確認，各區雖有討論其他方案，但最後都決定辦初選，而最遲的九東也在5月4日的第三次會議決定辦初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問決定辦初選後是否所有人都得採用同一機制，區指各區是各自討論，但後來戴耀廷想統一公民投票系統，如香港島與會者一直提倡投4票，但到了5月19日的第三次會議，要「特登處理由4票轉為1票」，與會人士無奈接受。陳慶偉問為何說「無奈」，區解釋因投4票是由司馬文建議，香港島與會者亦很支持，但後期因投票程式緣故，「大家覺得之前傾咗嘅事情，冇辦法實現」，故只能無奈接受。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後問及，新界東會議對初選機制是否沒有達成共識？區指至少決定了辦初選及目標議席為6席，只是要否爭取第7席需待初選投票日後再討論。辯方問，但公民投票是否相較其他選項被戴耀廷重點提及？區指「我只能話佢推動呢件事情上冇阻力」，並只有九東一區最初指不搞公民投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意五大訴求曾改動要短期內達成係好困難&quot;&gt;區同意五大訴求曾改動、要短期內達成「係好困難」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後就五大訴求發問。區同意，五大訴求內容曾經改動，特別在政府於2019年10月撤回《逃犯條例》後。Beel 舉例，如特首下台的口號由爭取普選取代？區同意「曾經有過相類似變化」，Beel 再指各人對五大訴求理解不同，區指「要視乎佢講嘅五大訴求係邊五大訴求」。法官陳仲衡指，無論如何，要短期內達成五大訴求是幾乎不可能的，區答「係好困難」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，能否說若政府不回應五大訴求，才會考慮否決預算案？區答「如果你話戴耀廷嘅主張嘅話呢，可以咁樣推演」，李運騰問區是否指其他人可能有其他說法？區再笑說：「睇吓個當事人係主張乜嘢講法」，同意可從選舉論壇觀察。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指政府回應視乎能否釋出善意-官指有否回應非組織者決定&quot;&gt;區指政府回應視乎能否「釋出善意」 官指有否回應非組織者決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再問，區如何理解政府的「回應」？區指最基本是政府能否「釋出善意」。他舉例，五大訴求其中一個訴求是「撤回暴動定性」，他任立法會議員時曾與朱凱廸提出私人條例草案，修改香港暴動法例以跟從國際標準。區指當然就政府而言「係好難去接納嘅」，「但如果接納嘅，係唔係就已經係回應部分關於撤回暴動定性嘅訴求呢？」，又指當時提出草案後被不少人批評，「因為佢哋覺得我哋認同咗暴動呢個概念。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，故若政府就一至兩項訴求作討論，也算是回應的一種？區指「都係有回應」。李運騰續指區諾軒面對的困難，是到底政府有否作出回應、或回應是否足夠，是由議員、而非35+組織者決定（“… up to the legislators to decide, not up to the organisers of 35+.”），因為一旦議員進入議會，組織者便很難控制他們（have very little control over them）。Beel 同意，指謀劃就是「空洞（hollow）」的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒確認初選文件無提及政府停擺及林鄭下台&quot;&gt;區諾軒確認初選文件無提及政府停擺及林鄭下台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再問，區辦初選的目標是否從來不是讓政府停擺？區答「我冇講過要政府停擺」，Beel 續問，那初選組織者在口頭或文件上是否從沒提及想政府停擺？區表示「初選整體由記者會到文件，我所憶述，就冇整體講過一次要政府停擺」。區亦表示：「初選文件以及相關新聞稿，都冇提及要林鄭月娥特首下台。」&lt;/p&gt;

After 7 years of negotiations, only 5 months passed between its political agreement and the European Parliament voting to freeze its ratification in May 2021.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Despite its short tenure, the deal offers an ideal window into Germany’s evolving debate on China in the post-Merkel period. It would have deepened EU-China economic ties, and, as this brief shows, was not universally popular within Germany at the time — despite German chancellor Angela Merkel’s leadership in pushing it through to a conclusion and suggestions by some European states that the CAI privileged the interests of Volkswagen and other German manufacturers. Examining the landscape of reactions to the CAI within Germany, this brief uncovers the dynamics at play as Berlin reconciles its deep economic ties to China with Beijing’s increasing tendency to act in ways that contravene European economic and political interests and values. These dynamics suggest that risk assessments of China in Germany are evolving in an uneven and gradual way that will shape the aperture for transatlantic coordination on China in the near term. U.S. policymakers seeking to enhance opportunities for joint action on China should expand venues to deliberate Beijing’s behavior and take care to ensure that the three parts of their invest-align-compete approach to China are working in concert, and not at odds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-provisions-of-the-cai&quot;&gt;Key Provisions of the CAI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negotiations over the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) began in January 2014 and spanned 35 meetings across seven years. The CAI would have replaced the individual bilateral investment treaties (BITs) — which regulate how host states treat foreign investors hailing from the treaty partner — that most EU member states hold with China. Brussels sought a comprehensive BIT to secure greater access and more predictable conditions for European firms and rectify the low levels of European investment in China; while bilateral trade in goods and services had grown substantially, when CAI negotiations kicked off China only accounted for 2.1 percent of overseas EU foreign direct investment (FDI), “way below what could be expected from two of the most important economic blocks on the planet.” For their part, Chinese policymakers were cognizant of China’s growing role as a capital exporter and wanted to put regulatory mechanisms in place that would protect Chinese investment access abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of limited progress, negotiations proceeded particularly quickly in the final months of 2020 as Chinese president Xi Jinping personally intervened to offer market-access concessions and salvage the deal before a new U.S. administration more willing to work with allies and partners on China entered office. German chancellor Angela Merkel proved an eager partner in this eleventh-hour push, leveraging the final days of Germany’s EU presidency to secure an in-principle agreement. During the last days of December, Merkel jointly announced the deal with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European Council president Charles Michel, and Chinese president Xi Jinping. The CAI was put forth for ratification in the European Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement had a relatively short tenure in public debate. In March 2021, Beijing sanctioned 10 individuals and four entities within the European Union in retaliation for EU sanctions that same month targeting Chinese individuals and entities involved in the persecution and mass detention of Uighurs in Xinjiang. This tit-for-tat move was a turning point in European debate on China, leading to a steep rise in strategic mistrust in Brussels and many EU capitals. As EU representative for foreign and security policy Josep Borrell put it, Chinese retaliatory sanctions “created a new atmosphere . . . a new situation” in EU thinking toward China. The president of the European Chamber of Commerce (EUCC), Jörg Wuttke, observed a “mood shift” in Berlin by early 2021. This move also pivotally shaped the trajectory of the CAI. In May 2021, the European Parliament voted to suspend ratification while China’s sanctions remained in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the geopolitical context was an important part of the debate over the CAI within Germany (as the next section shows), China’s concessions to EU investors under the CAI also proved controversial. The text of the agreement was made public on January 22, 2021, and the specific market-access commitments were released on March 12, 2021. The CAI’s core provisions can be split into three categories: market access, a level playing field, and sustainable development. Several provisions within the annexes are also worth introducing since they were hotly debated during the ensuing discussion of the deal within Europe, particularly in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;market-access&quot;&gt;Market Access&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CAI followed a “positive list” approach, specifying areas of the Chinese economy open for European investment. For the most part, these were “almost entirely a confirmation of earlier openings by China, either under the aegis of the WTO [World Trade Organization], or through the successive issuance of several ‘negative lists’ for foreign investment,” while new market openings were limited. Arguably, the CAI “prevents backsliding” by binding China under the power of an international treaty to preserve existing openings for EU firms in the future. EU negotiators also pointed to the “ratchet clause” — which stipulated that any further opening China offered investors of other nations would automatically be extended to EU investors — as a win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;level-playing-field&quot;&gt;Level Playing Field&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section of the CAI was its most popular among European businesses and policymakers. China addressed several longstanding complaints by European businesses in China, agreeing to: ban forced technology transfer, mandate transparency over subsidies in services, require state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to act on commercial bases and not discriminate against foreign firms in their procurement and sales of goods and services, and grant EU firms access to China’s standards setting bodies. Some analysts were skeptical of such promises, given what they saw as China’s weak record of compliance with prior international commitments in some of these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sustainable-development&quot;&gt;Sustainable Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the CAI, the European Union secured commitments from China not to lower or fail to enforce certain environmental and labor standards to attract investment. Specifically, China agreed to renew efforts to combat climate change and implement its promises under the 2015 Paris Agreement, as well as to make “continued and sustained efforts” to ratify outstanding International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions (No. 29 and No. 105) banning forced labor. As of the start of 2020, Beijing had reportedly refused to make commitments in this realm. As a result, EU negotiators presented this commitment as a “very strong signal” of China’s intent to improve practices in the environmental and labor domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;special-provisions&quot;&gt;Special Provisions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two further provisions are worth noting since they featured extensively in the debate about the CAI within Germany. The first is a provision in the annexes, which largely enshrined existing restrictions on European NGOs, business chambers, and foundations in China; in it, China also reserved the right to demand that senior executives of foreign nonprofit organizations in China be Chinese citizens. The second provision restricted the rights of European law firms in China, specifying that they were required to entrust Chinese law firms to deal with Chinese legal affairs on behalf of foreign clients, rather than provide representation or advisory services to them directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;germany-reacts-to-the-cai-202021&quot;&gt;Germany Reacts to the CAI: 2020–21&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the CAI was announced, EU-China relations were in a far different state than they had been seven years earlier. Beijing was cracking down on democratic freedoms in Hong Kong through a series of new regulatory measures; the scale and nature of Chinese internment practices targeted at the Uyghur population in Xinjiang were coming to light; Chinese “wolf warrior” diplomats were causing a stir on social media and in many European capitals; and throughout 2020, as Covid-19 spread across the European continent, China benefited financially and ideologically by selling personal protective equipment (PPE) to Europe for a profit, spreading disinformation about the virus’s origins, and highlighting tragedies to suggest the West was in chaotic decay. Commenting on the CAI’s suspension in May 2021, European trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis noted, “We cannot ignore the wider context of relations between the EU and China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a month before the CAI was announced in principle, U.S. president Donald Trump, who had ruffled feathers in European capitals for his “America first” rhetoric, was voted out of office in favor of Joseph Biden, whose appointees immediately began communicating a desire to work with partners and allies to preserve the liberal international order from threats — chief among them China. The incoming administration made its hesitation to the CAI clear prior to inauguration day. Just eight days before the European Union and China announced the agreement, Biden’s incoming national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, implied reservations by sharing that the Biden team would “welcome early consultations with our European partners on our common concerns about China’s economic practices.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CAI was introduced at this nexus: amid transformative changes in China’s international and domestic policy behavior and amid renewed prospects for transatlantic relations represented by the new U.S. administration. As a result, debate about the CAI within Europe — and among national governments, industry associations, and European civil society more broadly — concerned both the substance of the deal and its timing. The following sections examine how political, business, and civil-society communities within Germany, Europe’s largest and most influential economy, reacted to the CAI, drawing on not only interviews with members of these communities but also statements by the major German political parties, key German business and industry associations, and German civil society organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-reactions&quot;&gt;Political Reactions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German political debate on China is driven by coalitional and interparty politics, industry and civil-society positioning, geopolitical developments, and China’s own foreign and domestic policy behavior. The approaches to the CAI within each major political party in part confirm that political debate on China is now broadly driven by what analyst Roderick Kefferpütz has described as a “tug of war” between those who favor Merkel’s longstanding, engagement-centered approach to China and those who prefer a more values-driven foreign policy. The two frameworks for China policy do not fundamentally disagree on the facts of the Sino-German relationship — for example, that China is an important trading partner and that its rising crackdowns at home and assertiveness abroad are concerning. But the two camps differ in how to engage China based on these facts. As parties, Alliance 90/The Greens (the Greens) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) tend more toward a “dialogue and toughness” approach, as German minister of foreign affairs Annalena Baerbock put it on the 2021 federal-election campaign trail. Within Germany’s historically largest parties, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) — allied with the Christian Social Union (CSU) in Bavaria — and the Social Democratic Party (SPD), there is more disagreement on the best course of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the following sections show, the reactions of these four major German political parties to the CAI highlight these dynamics. Mirroring the diversity of policy positions found among the major U.S. political parties, each party had members that were more supportive and less supportive of both the CAI and of reevaluating Germany’s approach to a changing China. Nevertheless, some trends are evident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fdp-and-greens-led-the-criticism&quot;&gt;FDP and Greens Led the Criticism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political attention to the CAI was limited when it was agreed in principle — perhaps because this was during the winter holiday period — but grew in early 2021 after the full text was made available and China imposed surprising, retaliatory sanctions. None of the major parties were opposed to the CAI outright, but the Greens and FDP argued against ratification in its agreed form. These parties viewed the timing with skepticism: The announcement came as a new U.S. administration eager to work with Europe on China-related trade and investment issues was entering office and arguably delivered Beijing a diplomatic win amid concerning foreign and domestic policy developments. Beyond this, especially as the text was released, both the Greens and FDP concluded that the CAI represented a missed opportunity to press for greater alignment with European values in China’s market orientation and human rights practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beyond this, especially as the text was released, both the Greens and FDP concluded that the CAI represented a missed opportunity to press for greater alignment with European values in China’s market orientation and human rights practices.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese countersanctions on European entities got the ball rolling on a coordinated FDP response, which in June resulted in Breathing New Life into the CAI: 12 Liberal Demands for a Politically Viable Investment Deal with China, written by Sandra Weeser, a member of the Economic Affairs and Energy Committee in charge of trade policy, and Gyde Jensen, an FDP colleague who was serving as chairwoman of the Committee on Human Rights and Humanitarian Aid. Within the FDP, Jensen and Weeser faced little internal pushback to their critiques. As one interviewee argued, this reflected an increasingly skeptical party stance on China, owing not only to the party’s transatlanticist tendencies and growing concern about China’s human rights behavior, but also its core electorate, which included small- and medium-sized “Mittlestand” companies wary of growing competition at home from Chinese industry. According to the interviewee, the inclusion of calls to expand other trade agreements — including the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada and the Free Trade Agreement between Mexico and the European Union — in the 12 Liberal Demands report reassured the most ideologically pro-free trade elements of the party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Greens did not produce a similarly formal, standalone set of demands for the CAI, quite a few members spoke out against the deal. Reinhard Bütikofer, a German Greens politician serving as a member of the European Parliament, immediately questioned its hasty conclusion and later drew attention to a wide range of deficits he saw in the text. Bütikofer was not alone in his criticism. However, it is worth noting that some Greens were less critical at the time. One interviewee pointed to prominent Green Party Bundestag member Jürgen Trittin as an exception in this regard. Trittin reportedly saw the timing as unproblematic in a transatlantic context because the United States had recently secured its own economic concessions from China. That said, even Trittin felt that this “window of opportunity” in EU-China relations had not been utilized to its full advantage and argued that certain provisions in the CAI were inadequate in light of recent developments in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon reviewing the CAI, the Greens and FDP primarily responded to its chapter on sustainable development. China’s commitment to “make continued and sustained efforts to pursue ratification” of ILO conventions on forced labor were seen as insufficient, especially in light of the clear violations of these conventions that had come to light in Xinjiang. In an April 2021 interview, then-candidate for chancellor Annalena Baerbock argued that in the CAI, “the European side has not adequately addressed the issue of forced labor in relation to the oppressed Uyghur minority.” Margarete Bause, then serving as spokeswoman for human rights and humanitarian aid for the Greens’ parliamentary group, called the CAI a “mistake” due to the human rights situation in China. FDP lawmakers involved in organizing the party’s response to the deal, including Jensen and Weeser, had been following developments in Hong Kong and Xinjiang for some time with concern. In commentary on the CAI, the Greens and FDP repeatedly suggested more could be done to address Beijing’s forced labor practices in Xinjiang. While demanding that the CAI’s sustainable-development section be strengthened, including by forcing China commit to ratifying the relevant ILO conventions within a fixed timeline, many politicians from these two parties also advocated for additional initiatives to address these practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside the sustainable-development provisions, the FDP and Greens largely saw China’s market-access and level-playing-field commitments as steps in the right direction but inadequate to justify ratification. Members of both parties critiqued the continued lack of reciprocity promised by the deal, expressed skepticism based on China’s track record of not observing WTO rules, and argued that level-playing-field provisions needed to be combined with robust investment protections to ensure an improved situation for European firms. Other concerns, expressed in the FDP’s 12 Liberal Demands, included the restrictions on NGOs in Annex II, Article 9, and the prohibition on foreign law firms practicing Chinese law, which enshrined what the FDP saw as overly restrictive Chinese laws in treaty form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cdu-and-spd-grand-coalition-support-with-individual-critiques&quot;&gt;CDU and SPD: Grand Coalition Support with Individual Critiques&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDU and SPD were more muted than the FDP and Greens when it came to China during the 2021 federal-election campaign, which kicked off early that year when the CAI was still in play. This is reflected in party election manifestos: China was mentioned 22 times in the FDP manifesto and 16 times in the Greens’, while the CDU/CSU mentioned the country only seven times and the SPD only four. Nevertheless, trends can be distilled from individual lawmaker statements about the CAI and party statements on China in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Merkel’s leadership, the CDU supported the deal throughout the final year of her chancellorship. Despite individual criticisms regarding timing and substance, the CDU/CSU parliamentary group released an endorsement statement wherein Deputy Chairwoman Katja Leikert cited “worrying” developments in the human-rights situation in China but dismissed suggestions that the CAI should be leveraged to force meaningful improvements. Leikert argued it would be “naïve” to expect an investment agreement to “bring about a system change in China” and that Chinese commitments of any variety on this front “must be seen as the positive intermediate steps that they are.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chancellery and top CDU ministers took steps to boost support for the CAI within Germany. Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Peter Altmaier, a member of Merkel’s cabinet, immediately lauded the CAI as a “trade policy milestone” promising greater market access, legal certainty, and a better competitive environment in China. Merkel’s public defense of the deal was arguably limited, but she did attempt to drum up support in more targeted settings. In a speech to CDU/CSU lawmakers in May 2021, just after European trade commissioner Dombrovskis announced he would no longer actively pursue ratification, Merkel argued that despite human-rights concerns vis-à-vis China, the CAI remained a “very important undertaking” promising German companies more reciprocity in terms of market access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflective of the party today, some CDU members expressed reservations with the deal’s timing and what they saw as an inappropriate continuation of Germany’s business-first paradigm. In the CAI debate, individual CDU lawmakers questioned whether China would actually address forced labor, a key concern of the FDP and Greens. Norbert Röttgen, a CDU politician who had led the push against Huawei’s role in Germany’s fifth-generation (5G) wireless infrastructure in 2019, expressed alarm from his vantage point as chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the Bundestag that allowing the CAI to proceed as is, with China merely committing to “efforts” to ratify the ILO conventions on forced labor, would be akin to concluding an agreement in which “forced labor is implicitly accepted.” Nevertheless, there was no organized opposition to the deal within the CDU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the CDU’s governing coalition at the time, the SPD did not oppose the CAI upon its in-principle agreement. Some in the SPD were seeking to distance the party from Merkel’s business-first approach to China, while maintaining dialogue and engagement at the center of its approach. Germany’s muted reaction to Beijing’s draconian crackdown in Hong Kong was an important turning point for this group. In the wake of events in Hong Kong, Nils Schmid, the SPD’s spokesperson on the Committee on Foreign Affairs and who had played a role in Germany’s 5G debate, critiqued Merkel’s China approach for being “out of date” and argued it was time to retire the idea that “as we deepen our economic ties with China, it will become more liberal.” Spearheaded by Schmid, together with prominent SPD politicians Metin Hakverdi and Christoph Matschie, in June 2020 the SPD parliamentary group released a position paper on China calling for a tougher stance. While endorsing the European Union’s three-part approach to China as a partner, competitor, and systemic rival, the authors argued that systemic rivalry should condition both partnership and competition, rather than having Germany approach China as “a partner on Monday, competitor on Tuesday, rival on Wednesday.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, some wings of the SPD favored continuing a pro-engagement approach akin to Merkel’s, which had historically been the party’s stance. On the 2021 campaign trail, SPD candidate (now chancellor) Olaf Scholz — who had a track record of promoting trade and investment with China during his years as minister of finance and mayor of Hamburg — arguably downplayed the need for a departure from past policy. As members of a historically pro-labor party, many SPD politicians were particularly conscious of the employment and profit opportunities tied to trade and investment with China. For example, one interviewee pointed to the fact that SPD stronghold Lower Saxony holds an ownership stake in Volkswagen, which employs nearly 300,000 Germans and remains heavily invested in China. The SPD’s 2021 federal election platform signaled the perceived importance of continuing to “conduct dialogue with China on cooperation and competition in a . . . constructive and critical manner.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SPD did not issue a formal party position on the CAI. Its lack of organized opposition arguably reflects the diversity of views about China and the deal among its members but also suggests cautious but lingering optimism about deepened trade and investment ties with China despite geopolitical developments — in alignment with the CDU, its coalition partner at the time. Individual lawmaker statements support this conclusion. Even while expressing concern that China’s behavior was running antithetical to CAI promises, SPD member and chair of the European Parliament’s Committee on International Trade Bernd Lange argued that “a trade and investment agreement offers the possibility of dialogue and the gradual change of facts.” In an interview in September 2021 on what German trade policy toward China should look like, Bernd Westphal (the economic and energy policy spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group) did not mention the then-frozen CAI but did emphasize that the SPD sees “China as an important trading partner” and that Germany should focus its efforts on “integrating China into the rules-based world trade system.” Revealingly, FDP and Greens representatives answered the same question by discussing the various barriers they felt needed to be addressed before the CAI could even be reconsidered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;business-community&quot;&gt;Business Community&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expectations for the CAI among German industry had been high. Even the China-invested companies most in favor of continued engagement and fearful of Chinese retaliatory behavior supported calls by the federal government and business associations for greater reciprocity and a more level playing field in China for European and Chinese companies. While they had long advocated for better operational conditions for their firms in China, major German associations such as the Federation of German Industries (BDI) and Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry (DIHK) intensified this push as Chinese firms began leveraging European economic openness to sell and invest within the European Union — and as Beijing launched industrial policy plans such as Made in China 2025, which sought global leadership in fields of German economic advantage. Accordingly, while encouraging progress in CAI negotiations, German industry associations cautioned European negotiators that quality would be as important as speed; as the DIHK put it, any agreement would require an “ambitious offer by China,” leveling the playing field and reducing market asymmetries, to be meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By these metrics, German business associations found the CAI underwhelming. Despite calls for substance, “in the end, it was only speed,” as BDI executive board member Wolfgang Niedermark put it in April 2021. Few German firms found major “wins” to point to, especially in market access, a member of the business community shared. Market-access deliverables fell short of true reciprocity — and in many cases duplicated existing openings, primarily serving to “legally safeguard . . . access to market areas where liberalization has been under way for quite some time.” German business associations noted that longstanding complaints of their members in China had gone entirely unaddressed in the CAI, including in the fields of government procurement, intellectual property protection, and cross-border data transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This did not prevent the community from officially supporting the CAI. Business associations saw the deal as an important, if marginal, symbolic move toward improving investment planning and security. The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) called the CAI an “important step . . . in a process toward ever-improving framework conditions for fair competition” in China and felt it “must be ratified as quickly as possible.” The Chemicals Industry Association (VCI) “[welcomed] the agreement.” The Machinery and Equipment Manufacturers Association (VDMA) called the CAI a “bird in the hand” whose provisions represented a “first step in the right direction.” As a BDI representative put it in April 2021, “It’s all a piece on our way to have rule-based cooperation between China and us. And we are not enthusiastic, but we think it is a good thing to have such an agreement.” Another member of the German business community held that despite its deficits, the CAI was “one part in an overall strategy that moves us forward in a certain direction.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, German industry largely welcomed its core provisions as a step forward, while acknowledging they were just that: a step that would need to be combined with others to level the playing field for European firms in China. Almost immediately, the attention of these major business associations vis-à-vis the CAI turned to how to achieve additional business community objectives following its as-is ratification. Friedolin Strack of the BDI, for example, argued in April 2021 that a “CAI phase two” would be necessary: “We have reached a certain step, but we need more steps. We should make clear at every occasion (and we in BDI try to do that) . . . that we do not leave China in this position of feeling comfortable in this role of a Party-driven economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to its perceived deficits, when the CAI was frozen due to tit-for-tat sanctions in spring 2021, the German business community did not see this as a big loss or organize to lobby against the freeze. On balance, Chinese concessions were not seen as substantial, and businesses largely remained interested in the Chinese market with or without an EU-China investment agreement in place. As BDI’s Niedermark put it after China sanctioned EU officials, a failure of the CAI would “not mean that we have to stop our engagement or could not even invest more in China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;civil-society&quot;&gt;Civil Society&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German civil society — including NGOs, foundations, and think tanks — meaningfully entered the national debate on the CAI after March 2021, once the full text was published and China implemented retaliatory sanctions on EU entities. This group was in some ways the most outspoken in its criticism of the deal. Civil-society actors had not been extensively engaged during negotiations; although the directorate-general for Trade at the European Commission had convened “civil society dialogues” beginning in 2017, these reportedly “served primarily as a communication tool and mostly attracted business representatives.” As a result, the initial reaction was one of surprise at the NGO provision. As Bertram Lang, a researcher at Goethe University with expertise on civil-society issues in China, shared, “When the Annexes were published . . . there was mostly astonishment, because NGOs didn’t really have the CAI on the radar.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprise among civil society was soon accompanied by criticism, even if some groups expressed this cautiously and privately. As Tagesschau reported, German political foundations — many of which had offices in China — found the annex’s NGO provision “irritating” and “threatening,” a symbol that this community was not seen as important enough to be included in negotiations. But they were also immediately concerned about implications for their operations within China. As Lang shared in an interview, foundations reacted strongly to this provision partially because “they read it as if the next day, they would have to appoint a [Chinese] senior executive” to lead their operations in China in order comply with Chinese law. As noted above, the NGO provision would also affect businesses and industry associations such as the BDI, and this helped fuel media attention to the issue within Germany in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Surprise among civil society was soon accompanied by criticism, even if some groups expressed this cautiously and privately.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think tanks also drove criticism of the deal. For example, while seeing the market access and level-playing-field provisions as positive developments, Mikko Huotari and Max Zenglein of the influential German think tank, the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS), argued that the “(geo)political context and what’s not in the agreement” meant that it was not “the deal the European side had hoped for when negotiations started seven years ago.” On the eve of the CAI’s in-principle agreement, a group of 14 EU-China experts at German and other European think tanks and research organizations suggested that concluding the CAI at the end of 2020 would symbolically endorse Beijing’s political trajectory after a year of shocking developments in its international and domestic policy and that “Europe will thus lose leverage not only on issues critical for its future competitiveness but also on fundamental value issues.” Noah Barkin, managing editor at the Rhodium Group and a visiting senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, shared in an interview that criticism grew over time, particularly after China imposed sanctions on European entities, including MERICS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-window-into-evolving-german-debate-on-china&quot;&gt;A Window into Evolving German Debate on China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing remains interested in the CAI, particularly as support for stricter investment screening grows in many European capitals. The most immediate hurdles to the agreement are China’s sanctions and implementation of the ILO conventions, as attention in Europe has grown substantially over the past year toward Beijing’s human- rights practices. These hurdles to the CAI will be difficult to overcome as promise fatigue grows in European capitals. China’s commitments to uphold international economic norms or respect European values and interests are increasingly viewed with skepticism — a trend accelerated by Beijing’s tacit support for Russia during the Ukraine war despite its stated support for sovereignty and territorial integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;These hurdles to the CAI will be difficult to overcome as promise fatigue grows in European capitals.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dynamic is evident in how European leaders have reacted to China’s more recent efforts at signaling commitment to CAI ratification. In meetings with sanctioned EU organizations and individuals in fall 2022, Beijing reportedly communicated that outstanding restrictions would not be strictly enforced. Reflective of the wide range of concerns with China and the CAI, however, this did little to move the needle. Furthermore, although Beijing announced in April 2022 that it would ratify ILO conventions 29 and 105, arguably following through on its promises to make “efforts” toward ratification, many European policymakers did not see this as a gamechanger. Ongoing concerns about China’s human-rights practices, as well as an overall sense of skepticism regarding promises from Beijing, had taken hold in many corners of the German and European parliaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a bilateral investment deal between Europe and China looks unlikely as of 2023, the Biden administration will be seeking to maximize transatlantic coordination in the years ahead as U.S. strategic competition with China accelerates. The CAI’s trajectory uncovers several realities about the dynamics of German debate on China that U.S. policymakers would do well to keep in mind going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, the primary determinant of German sentiment on China will be Beijing’s actions.&lt;/strong&gt; Souring German (and European) sentiment toward China is not the result of U.S. pressure, despite Chinese assessments to the contrary. The key driver is the trajectory of a changing China. China’s ratification of ILO conventions in 2022 did little to convince European policymakers that Beijing was newly committed to improving its human rights practices, for example, because its policies in Xinjiang were telling another story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, pull factors remain strong for many German enterprises in China, preserving a pro-engagement voice in the national debate.&lt;/strong&gt; Today, while German companies are wary of a growing set of risks to their business operations in China and increasingly exploring options for diversification, they remain interested in China as a production site, source of innovation, and market. Larger German firms (and their top suppliers) with meaningful China exposure continue to invest heavily in the country. Many German firms are adapting to growing geopolitical tensions by localizing staff, supply chains, and data flows and taking advantage of local research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and partnerships with Chinese firms to tailor their products and services. A representative of one business association observed that while the field itself may be shifting and becoming less level, given rising Party-state intervention in shepherding economic resources toward strategic ends, “there is still a lot of political and economic will to . . . play on that playing field” among German companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These pull factors explain why China-invested German corporate heavyweights recently “butted heads” with the Greens-controlled Foreign Office and Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action over government missives to diversify away from China and an intensified emphasis on systemic rivalry in some corners of the Traffic Light Coalition, which they see as risking retaliation from Beijing and jeopardizing profits in China. It also suggests that this pro-engagement lobby will remain a player in German debate on China going forward. The fault line within the German business community on this topic, several members of this community suggested, may increasingly be between those companies with a China presence and those without, as investing in China is becoming harder due to German government pressures, market competition, and a changing Chinese regulatory environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nevertheless, and third, support is widespread among German businesses (and government officials) for an enhanced EU and transatlantic toolbox of defensive measures designed to level the playing field and bring China more in line with the multilateral rules-based system.&lt;/strong&gt; German industry felt the CAI failed to secure comprehensive improvements in these areas, and associations called for additional instruments to level the playing field, such as stronger European investment screening and anti–foreign subsidy measures. As a representative of German business put it, “We’re all in heavy favor of sharpening our tools because . . . it’s a much better diplomatic deterrent and a clearer way of working together.” Another representative held that supranational tools were widely supported given prioritization on improving reciprocity and leveling the playing field: “China reacts to strength.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-takeaways-for-transatlantic-cooperation-on-china&quot;&gt;Recommendations: Takeaways for Transatlantic Cooperation on China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration would do well to recognize these realities as it seeks to enhance transatlantic cooperation on China in the years ahead. Cooperation should be approached incrementally, with recognition that while risk assessments of China in the European Union’s largest member state are evolving, they are doing so in an uneven and gradual way, with significant disagreement over the speed and scale of policy change. Some of the largest businesses remain ambivalent about national directives that push the country toward targeted economic and technological decoupling from China, such as Germany’s recent supply chain due-diligence law and proposals to eliminate government investment guarantees and screen outbound investment. And as negotiations over Germany’s China strategy clarify, differences remain between and within the major German political parties regarding adjustments to policy toward Beijing. These realities do not mean German policymakers are inattentive to the risks associated with a changing China but — as in any democracy — will create pressures on political parties and lawmakers that may naturally condition the scope and speed of policy response to these risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional channels for U.S.-EU consultation about China’s foreign and domestic policy developments and the risks they pose are needed.&lt;/strong&gt; From the perspective of the European Union, worrisome trends include but are not limited to the following: China’s tacit support for Russia in the war in Ukraine; expanding influence in international organizations, including those intended to protect and preserve human rights; military assertiveness across the Taiwan Strait, a key maritime trading route; economic coercion against both European states and its neighbors in the Indo-Pacific; efforts to export Chinese policing and security practices to authoritarian regimes; and influence operations in Europe — all of which overlap with U.S. concerns about China’s rise. The number of substantive venues for regular dialogue on China have increased under the Biden administration. For example, the EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council first met in September 2021. The high-level EU-U.S. Dialogue on China was launched in May 2021 and the now meets regularly. More frequent government exchanges on China, as well as regularized Track 1.5 and Track 2 dialogues, could serve as an additional basis for sharing information about the Chinese actions and initiatives that are most destabilizing, determining which can be jointly addressed most feasibly, and developing effective policy approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The overall health and stability of the transatlantic relationship will be vital for coordination on China, so care should be taken to anticipate and address spillover effects from the U.S. “invest-align-compete” approach to China.&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. policymakers need to ensure that the “invest” and “compete” components of this three-part framework are not working at odds with its desire to deepen alignment with key partners and allies. Recent U.S. export controls on China, as well as the Inflation Reduction Act, triggered frictions with Europe not only because they affect the economic prospects of European firms, but also because they were reportedly carried out with insufficient consultation and communication about these consequences. Putting the merit of individual policies aside, ensuring regular attention to implications for broader transatlantic ties in U.S. economic and technology policymaking — especially as this becomes a more important part of U.S.-China strategic competition — will preserve the goodwill needed for further coordination on China down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（17日）踏入審訊第27天。辯方昨展示戴耀廷發出的新界東協調文件，區諾軒指不知悉亦不同意使用「會運用」否決權字眼，在盤問下認感覺被戴「騎劫」。區今主動表示，「我諗過我覺得唔應該用『騎劫』呢個字眼去定性呢件事，始終唔想再用呢類詞語，結果又傷害戴耀廷」，指文件和自己過往兩年認知「存在落差」、自己如「蒙在鼓裏」，並直言報名表列明須認同他及戴主導之協調會議共識，「我終歸難免有把關嘅責任。」辯方又引 WhatsApp 紀錄，顯示新東文件曾於2020年4及5月以廣播功能發出，惟區承認不在廣播名單亦沒有收到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;昨認感被戴耀廷騎劫-區諾軒今改稱不想用該字眼傷害戴耀廷&quot;&gt;昨認感被戴耀廷「騎劫」 區諾軒今改稱不想用該字眼傷害戴耀廷&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒繼續接受代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉盤問。辯方昨於庭上展示戴耀廷2020年6月8日在組織者群組發出的「35+新東final」文件，以「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新界東協調機制協議」為題，列明「會運用」權力否決預算案，區承認昨才得悉字眼非「會積極運用」，會上亦有質疑否決預算案的聲音。被問戴耀廷是否「騎劫」反對意見，區表示「確實係有呢個感覺」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉今再指，區當時沒有開過檔案，因為若有開，他並不會同意當中字眼，亦會有所行動。區同意，並主動補充：「噚日辯方律師問我有冇一個騎劫嘅感覺，我諗過我覺得唔應該用騎劫呢個字眼去定性呢件事。始終唔想再用呢類詞語，結果又傷害戴耀廷」，陳志全和何桂藍等微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區認新東文件會運用字眼與過往兩年認知有落差認蒙在鼓裏&quot;&gt;區認新東文件「會運用」字眼與過往兩年認知有落差、認「蒙在鼓裏」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，「但係我認知當時嘅情況係，若果呢份文件係當時候係咁樣寫，確實同我認知協調會議中與會者的意見，存在落差」，並指想大家留意「報名表始終有一句係咁寫嘅，『參與者須要認同由戴耀廷和區諾軒主導的協調會議共識』，我終歸難免有把關嘅責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問，區是否不知道為何文件會寫「會運用」？區指當文件昨天出現在他面前，「甚至可以講，同我過往兩年幾對件事嘅認知，存在落差。」李問會否可能是初稿或草稿，區指若是初稿，應會有「（初稿）」字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後問，就「騎劫」的答案，區諾軒是否昨晚回去認真想過，再答一個更好的版本，區同意。馬指他較關注區當時的感想，問區案發時是否的確有「被騎劫」的感覺。法官李運騰指區當時不知情，如何能有相關感受；陳仲衡亦指，「騎劫」一詞是由馬維騉提出，並非由證人自己說出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指：「可能我回應得唔好啦，因為我唔知道個稿件原來寫『會運用』，我冇理由喺當時會出現一個被騎劫或者任何負面嘅感覺，我只能形容當時嘅情況我係蒙在鼓裏。」李運騰問區說「蒙在鼓裏」是什麼意思，區解釋即當時新東協議最後採用「會運用」，而他並不知道。馬維騉一度指，原意今天完成盤問，但如區在周末再有其他進一步想法並在下周補充，或要再盤問他，惟法官陳慶偉即說「no」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;35新東及35新東final分別於4及5月已發出-區均不知情&quot;&gt;「35+新東」及「35+新東final」分別於4及5月已發出 區均不知情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續就戴耀廷和趙家賢的 WhatsApp 訊息發問，顯示「35+新東final」的文件曾於5月7日發出，但訊息發出者為一串數字及「@broadcast」的字眼，亦沒有顯示接收者。法官問及意思，控方解釋是 WhatsApp 廣播功能，該數字是從廣播名單而來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續問，不論發布者是誰，「35+新東final」文件是否於5月7日已存在，而區並不知道，區答「真的不知道」，且直至拘捕前都不知道。區亦確認，「35+新東final」的文件，確實沒有在包含所有新東參與者、他亦是成員的「35+計劃新東訊息發布區」中發布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後再次提及戴耀廷和趙家賢的 WhatsApp 紀錄，問區是否並非廣播名單內，區指「我真係冇印象我係喺呢個廣播群組裡面」。李再引該紀錄，顯示名為「35+新東」的文件於4月16日由某人以廣播發出，即首次新東會議的兩日後，亦沒有顯示接收者，區指他沒有收過該檔案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區認沒收到有關新西會議廣播訊息我諗大家都覺得想當然我係知道&quot;&gt;區認沒收到有關新西會議廣播訊息：我諗大家都覺得想當然我係知道&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒並主動提及該紀錄另一條訊息，有關新西協調會議將在5月8日於石景澄、林廷衞議員聯合辦事處舉行。區略激動指：「我就肯定100個 percent 係冇收過（該訊息），我由案發去到今時今日，我呢一刻先知道元朗安寧路世宙3號地舖原來係石景澄林廷衞議員辦事處」，並指「我一路以為係張可森議員辦事處」。李運騰指，法庭不清楚該資訊是否正確，區同意，但強調「如果呢個訊息我有收過，我就會聯繫到呢個地址同呢兩位議員嘅名」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指區稱他沒有出席過任何新西會議。區答「係啊，但我作為初選嘅主要協調人，我可以好肯定同法庭講，新界西嘅開會通知，呢一個訊息，我係冇收過」，說時並苦笑。陳慶偉續問區作為組織者，有否特別原因沒有收到該些訊息，區先指因他不在廣播群組內，陳再追問區不獲告知是因為溝通錯誤、分工、抑或其他原因？區再略激動苦笑：「我諗大家都覺得想當然我係知道囉，我而家真係真感情，我蒙在鼓裏。」彭卓棋、施德來等發笑，有被告笑着重複：「真感情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指據分工主力負責港島-唔係好關心新界西&quot;&gt;區指據分工主力負責港島 「唔係好關心新界西」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區確認，新西會議的時間地點均不是他決定，而他沒有出席新西會議是因「唔係好關心新界西」，指他當時主力負責香港島，「我的確冇辦法出席所有協調會議。」陳仲衡問他有否向戴耀廷及趙家賢表達他沒興趣，區指沒有，「但係根據當時分工，我知道自己嘅責任係要搞好香港島嘅協調會議」，他事前亦知道戴耀廷會出席新西會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，法官李運騰庭上亦有向區諾軒展示不同文件，就「民主派九龍西協調機制（初稿）」，區記得戴耀廷在首次九西會議後傳予他；至於「民主派九龍西協調機制協議」，他指沒有「初稿」字眼，理解為「終定本」，並指很大機會在戴耀廷6月8日發出時看過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「民主派新界西協調機制協議」，區指很有信心6月8日戴耀廷傳送時沒開過檔案，因他是在報名期才知道新西使用「會運用」字眼。李其後再將「民主派新西協調機制（初稿）」及「民主派新界西協調機制協議」一同展示，區直言「真係未見過」該份初稿，「我又係第一次見。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（17日）踏入審訊第27天。區諾軒繼續接受代表陳志全的大狀盤問，區同意戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉一文是對未來的「預測」，又指是戴的「狂想」，因屬「好唔現實嘅預測」。法官問是否戴的「藍圖」，又指戴認為該十步是「香港宿命」，區則指認為是「final fantasy（最終幻想）」，多名被告大笑。區又認同，文章最後提及香港社會停頓、血腥鎮壓等，「的確係講到好末日預言」，並重申不支持戴的推測，包括第一步的大規模DQ，自言他因有人被DQ才能當選立會議員，「我一直都相信，唔應該有呢啲事情發生。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方就多篇戴耀廷文章發問-指立會過半可與政權討價還價提及望特首下台&quot;&gt;辯方就多篇戴耀廷文章發問 指立會過半可與政權討價還價、提及望特首下台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒繼續接受代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉盤問。馬就多篇戴耀廷的文章發問，其中2020年3月3日在《蘋果日報》的〈反制警察政權就要立會奪半〉，區同意戴表示若反對陣營在立會奪半，可以否決預算案來與特區政權討價還價。法官李運騰問總結戴耀廷說法有何用意，馬指是嘗試顯示戴耀廷的想法如法官陳慶偉所言有「演進（evolvement）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指辯方應展示戴耀廷在 Facebook 分享，由「攬炒藝術家」於《立場新聞》發布的〈9%乃林鄭倒台關鍵〉，區指是第一次看到該文章，但按字面知道有想林鄭倒台的意思，並指戴到了3月31日的〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉一文才提及最終目標要特首下台。李問案發期間戴耀廷有否顯示想林鄭下台，區答「佢有提及過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴文章提齊上齊落-區指實際做不到協調機制有分歧&quot;&gt;戴文章提「齊上齊落」 區指實際做不到、協調機制有分歧&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後展示戴於3月10日在《蘋果日報》發表的〈齊上齊落 目標35+〉，區認為標題公允反映戴的看法，但「實質嘅情況我就唔覺得做到齊上齊落啦」。他引述文章指「這是一個有公民參與的協調機制。在這大原則下，細節仍有待確定」，指戴期望機制可行，但實際上未確定細節。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他又引戴指「若參選的人及團體不參與協調或不按協調的承諾行事，選民不積極參與兩個階段的公民參與程序，這艱巨的目標都難以達到」，指雖戴望達成此艱巨目標，但實際上當時「我哋都見到協調機制發展係有分歧嘅」。法官陳仲衡指，戴提及立會過半，民主派可「達到一個里程碑，有了新的根據點可向下一個里程碑邁進」，但沒提是什麼里程碑。區指的確沒清楚說明，但該句首提及「真普選的路途還遠」，真普選亦是五大訴求之一。區亦確認，該文章沒有用到「大殺傷力憲制武器」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬其後展示3月31日的〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉，提到戴形容選票是「武器」，指他在2013年提出公民抗命是「大殺傷力武器」，又指若反對派立會過半，會成為「大殺傷力憲制武器」，區確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方就真攬炒十步發問-區同意為戴耀廷預測&quot;&gt;辯方就〈真攬炒十步〉發問 區同意為戴耀廷預測&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後引4月28日〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉一文，戴提及「按我的推算，這條香港攬炒宿命路的時間線可能是這樣」，並列出十步。區諾軒同意，戴是「講緊一啲可能，而呢啲可能係未發生嘅」，亦是對未來事件的預測（prediction）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續就該十步發問，其中第一步於2020年7至8月發生：「政府廣泛取消民主派人士參選立法會資格，包括現任議員。民主派由 Plan B 繼續參選」，區同意戴預料在提名期有大規模取消資格，並在法官詢問下同意「Plan B」是之前提及的替補機制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第三步在10月發生：「特首及律政司開展司法程序DQ民主派議員，但因法庭需時處理，故民主派繼續主導立法會」，區同意戴預測9月選舉進行後會有議員被DQ，而司法程序是指司法覆核，「例如話你宣誓唔夠真誠」。法官陳仲衡指認為重點是民主派在DQ後仍主導立會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問攬炒十步是否戴耀廷藍圖-區形容為最終幻想六步已經太遠&quot;&gt;官問「攬炒十步」是否戴耀廷「藍圖」 區形容為「最終幻想」、六步已經太遠&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第四步及五步提及否決所有政府撥款申請和財政預算案，特首解散立法會；第六步則指：「立法會重選，民主派或要派出Plan C參選，因Plan B也可能被DQ，但仍取得35席以上」。馬維騉指，明顯這是戴的「癡心妄想（wishful thinking）」，惟李指區不能對此評論，陳慶偉亦指辯方起初已指出這只是戴的預測。法官陳仲衡問，但在本案而言，參選者是否不可能達到第六步，因最多只有 Plan B。區指有參選人預備 Plan B，「但講 Plan C 真係太遠啦。其實呢六步都已經太遠啦，有咁多前設。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指辯方並非問及是否可行，並改問區會否同意這是戴的「藍圖（blueprint）」或「預測（prediction）」。區答「我會話係佢嘅狂想」，鄒家成、何桂藍等多人發笑。李運騰問即使是狂想，但也是戴很希望實現（very much desired）的？區回應：「我點解會咁講，係因為係啲好唔現實嘅預測囉」，林卓廷重複說「預測囉」，鄒家成和吳政亨亦交談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續問，是否即是戴耀廷的「幻想（fantasy）」？法官陳慶偉指，對馬而言是「幻想」，但對戴耀廷而言是「香港宿命」，正如文章標題。李運騰亦補充戴認為是香港的最終宿命。區再說：「對我嚟講，我真係覺得呢個係狂想，所以係 fantasy」，隔了一會再說：「Final fantasy（最終幻想）」，即引來多名被告笑出聲，余慧明掩嘴大笑。李運騰指，認為區已不能再就戴的想法有再進一步回應，除非戴有跟他直接說，否則區的估計不會比我們好多少（“His guess is as good as ours.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區認戴耀廷攬炒十步如末日預言不支持其推測&quot;&gt;區認戴耀廷攬炒十步如末日預言、不支持其推測&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後問及第八至十步，提及大舉拘押民主派領袖，街頭抗爭更激烈，出現血腥鎮壓、發起三罷令社會陷入停頓，西方終對中共實行制裁。馬問，是否如聖經《啟示錄》中的「末日（apocalypse）」，並笑言只是比喻，而不是實際上的世界末日。區諾軒指戴有提及街頭抗爭很激烈、令香港社會陷入停頓，「的確係講到好末日預言。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續同意馬指，他並不希望攬炒十步在港發生。馬續問，是否連第一步大規模DQ也不想？區凝重答：「我係一個因為人哋被取消資格而當選嘅立法會議員，我一直都相信，唔應該有呢啲事情發生」，何桂藍發笑。馬問，故戴是否不支持任何一步在港發生，法官陳慶偉更改問題為區並不支持戴耀廷的預計或幻想？區答「我並不支持其十步推測」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷指攬炒可指特首辭職政府停擺中共宣布一國兩制結束&quot;&gt;戴耀廷指攬炒可指特首辭職、政府停擺、中共宣布一國兩制結束&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後指，該文不是戴首次提及「攬炒」，續要求展示4月14日的文章〈攬炒的定義和時間〉。文中戴指「攬炒的定義，可以是指立法會被解散和特首辭職，也可以是指特區政府運作停擺，亦可以是指中共正式宣佈一國兩制結束」，區確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，戴在文中問立會過半能否帶來上述後果，之後並回答該問題，提及全國人大可釋法讓中央政府解散立法會及成立臨時立法會，防止政府停擺，「一旦中共這樣做，那是實質宣佈一國兩制結束，也會產生攬炒結果。」李並指，戴其後提及攬炒的時間，指民主派在約一年間需兩次取得立法會過半議席，才能做到攬炒，而「除非中共肯讓步，不然它是難以阻止攬炒，只是攬炒不會即時發生，很大可能是在2021年底才爆發」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續問，那是戴的幻想抑或預測？區指文中與戴後來攬炒十部曲發生的步驟「都係相近嘅」，並在馬維騉詢問下確認，攬炒至少有上文所述3個意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（17日）踏入審訊第27天。區諾軒繼續接受盤問，辯方指民主派取得立會過半後或令政府寸步難行，而政府有兩種「解決方法」，包括與民主派磋商，或以拘捕和DQ等方法「將多數變為少數」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方就政改方案發問，區主動引述前香港運輸及房屋局局長張炳良著書，指政改需獲特首同意、立會三分之二議員支持及更重要的中央政府同意。法官李運騰問是否令「五大訴求 缺一不可」更難實現，區指因此「睇咗咁多嘢、反思咗咁耐，我都係覺得香港嘅民主路係要透過談判，大家一齊傾，凝聚社會共識，大家先至有機會」，有被告聞言嘆氣。此外，被問到陳志全案發時有否「鬥黃」，區指陳有現任議員優勢，「我會話佢無誘因鬥黃。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指據往績陳志全非支持攬炒一派-但稱就本案不望主觀評論被告&quot;&gt;區指據往績陳志全非支持攬炒一派 但稱就本案不望主觀評論被告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒繼續接受代表陳志全的大狀馬維騉盤問。區曾受訪提及參選人對「35+」有兩種想像，一是透過議會過半提高民主派議價能力爭五大訴求，另一種是不惜攬炒和否決預算案向北京施壓。馬問陳志全是否不支持攬炒的一派？區指「我如果公允啲去講呢，往績嚟講，我係會咁歸納嘅」，但指始終本案談及案發期間各人行動，「所以我唔希望我自己用主觀嘅評論，去評論每一個被告。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指陳志全為現任議員-無誘因鬥黃無印象言行比過往激進&quot;&gt;區指陳志全為現任議員 無誘因「鬥黃」、無印象言行比過往激進&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續就「鬥黃」發問，區曾同意該詞指人們試圖表現得越激進越好。馬問比起「鬥黃」所指的鬥爭，形容比賽的「比黃」是否更合適，區指若放在選舉競爭，「黃」指部分支持者的信念，亦可是比賽的一種。馬續問，根據案發時政治氣氛，參選人是否認為表現得越激進就能獲越多選民支持？區指視乎政治人物定位，並同意對素人而言尤甚。法官陳仲衡一度質疑是否問及意見，區指那是「政治常識」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續引區諾軒 Facebook 文章〈我對立法會協調的「囚徒困境」理解〉，提及「無論知名度、議事經驗、往績，做過議員一定比未做過的好，這叫做現任優勢（incumbency advantage）」，區同意現任議員比素人更有優勢，因可參考往績、從社會議題看到其表現、其政治理念較清晰、透過多年服務聚集支持者，公眾亦可知該人是否勤力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，陳志全為兩屆立法會議員，公眾會熟悉其政綱，區同意，並同意陳作為時任立法會議員享有「現任優勢」。馬問陳是否沒有「鬥黃」，區表示「我會話佢冇誘因鬥黃」，亦指沒有印象陳的言行比過往激進。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷716宣布休息-官問誰指示及付款予香港民研做民調-區認是問號&quot;&gt;戴耀廷7.16宣布休息 官問誰指示及付款予香港民研做民調 區認是「問號」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就區諾軒退出初選，區確認在7月15日於 Facebook 宣布退出初選工作，趙家賢翌日亦退出，戴耀廷同日在 Facebook 宣布休息。區表示事前曾去戴耀廷的港大辦公室商討，戴指要「諗一諗」，二人其後沒再討論，區並在宣布退出時將其聲明連結發送至組織者群組，戴沒有特別回應。法官李運騰問，故區只能從戴的公告得知其決定，區同意：「不過相信佢係受我影響嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示戴耀廷7月16日的帖文，提到初選協調的主要工作已完成，「因過去幾個月的勞累，我希望在未來的一段日子，爭取多一些休息時間，也可以更專注於學術的工作。」帖文亦提到選舉日前兩周會開始進行民調，結果會在9月2日公布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，若區和趙退出、戴亦休息，誰繼續進行民調？區指已委託香港民意研究所。李再追問：「但誰會向他們發指示和付款？」區答：「呢個係一個問號嚟」，黃碧雲、楊雪盈等多人發笑。區指民調始終要開支，他不確定民主動力有否「畀定一個民調嘅錢」，「有關問題可以問返民主動力。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡亦指，戴在帖文沒有提及要「退出」初選，只是指當時餘下需要做的已不多，望爭取多些休息時間。區同意，故「以事論事，我就轉述咗『休息』呢個字眼」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;立會選舉延期後陳志全辭任-法官問及僅35名民主派當選情況&quot;&gt;立會選舉延期後陳志全辭任 法官問及僅35名民主派當選情況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全最終報名參選立法會。區諾軒確認原定9月的立法會選舉延期，現任議員續任至少一年，惟陳志全當時沒有延任並辭職。馬維騉其後就立法會程序發問，問反對派取得立會過半，是否可預期立法會和各委員會主席均由民主派擔任？區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡即指，立法會主席一般不會就預算案投票，若「35+」望否決預算案，是否不會投選民主派任主席？區指不一定，要視乎當時環境，如建制派是否有足夠議席；並同意若民主派只有剛好35人當選並任立會主席，只有34人能投票。法官李運騰指馬的問題有太多前設。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問民主派過半是否令政府寸步難行-區稱取決政府是否願意商討&quot;&gt;辯方問民主派過半是否令政府寸步難行 區稱取決政府是否願意商討&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬表示，若民主派和建制派各有35席，情況會很「棘手」（tricky），但若有多於35席，會預期民主派佔據立法會大部分重要職位，區同意。馬續問，若反對派獲得多於35席，能否說會令政府「寸步難行」？區指取決於政府與立法會多數派是否願意「一齊傾」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指過半後政府或以dq拘捕等將多數變為少數&quot;&gt;辯方指過半後政府或以DQ、拘捕等「將多數變為少數」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，若上述情況出現，有兩種「解決方法」，一是政府與反對派磋商（negotiate），二是政府以不同方法，將立會的「多數變為少數（reduce the majority into a minority）」，有被告發笑。法官陳仲衡問是什麼意思，馬解釋變成少數有很多方法，包括DQ。李運騰問馬是否假設法庭會容許這樣發生？馬說認為政府比法庭更有權力，多人發笑，李亦微笑，馬即指雖有人發笑，但他無意作出諷刺（sarcastic）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，認為問題不恰當，又反問辯方指所謂「消除多數（remove majority）」的意思是「殺了他們？（“By killing them?”）」，着馬要問得更具體，多人發笑。馬指在極端情況下，可能是拘捕和DQ。陳慶偉問馬最終問題為何，馬指對現時答案滿意，沒有再追問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意政改須獲三分二支持-引張炳良書指香港民主路要談判才有機會&quot;&gt;區同意政改須獲三分二支持 引張炳良書指香港民主路要談判才有機會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後指，預算案一般過半數便能通過，惟政改方案則須三分之二議員支持才能通過，亦與達致普選息息相關，區同意。陳仲衡問，故35+目標從不是要取得立會三分之二以推動政改？區確認：「冇咁講過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問區，是否必須多於三分之二才能啟動政改，而特首如不獲足夠支持，也不能以自己想要的方式（in its own way）推動？區同意，指可參考《基本法》第64及74條，又指因此這麼多年來，「我哋成日話民主派係關鍵少數，就係因為民主派有起碼三分之一嘅議席。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，故政府事實上在推動政改上沒有話語權（does not have a say），而是取決於能否獲三分之二議員支持？而即使特首想推行政改，亦不是他一人說了算？區同意，並問法官能否引述一位學者說法，陳仲衡着他指出，又指「相信不是D1（戴耀廷）吧」，有人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，前香港運輸及房屋局局長張炳良在2022年（應為2021年），曾出版《Can Hong Kong Exceptionalism Last?（香港的例外會長久嗎？）》一書，提及香港要實現民主政制，根據既有機制是要凝聚社會上的共識：「首先特首要同意咁做、立法會要有三分之二議員支持（換言之係香港大多數嘅政治團體），更加重要嘅係要得到中央政府嘅支持，起碼要通過呢三個窗口，所以特首很難一個人說了算。」區急促談及書本內容時，傳譯主任一度大聲打斷：「慢慢嚟唔該」，多名被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，這是否令「五大訴求 缺一不可」更難實現（more unrealistic），因特首的想法並非決定性（determinant）？林卓廷說「嘩」。區續說：「所以……睇咗咁多嘢、反思咗咁耐，我都係覺得香港嘅民主路係要透過談判，大家一齊傾，凝聚社會共識，大家先至有機會。」林卓廷聞言一度嘆氣低頭，鄒家成亦攤開雙手聳肩和發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意引權力及特權法成立調查委員會同須三分之二議員支持&quot;&gt;區同意引《權力及特權法》成立調查委員會同須三分之二議員支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，若是由議員而非政府提出法案，則需在地方選區和功能組別均取得過半支持才能通過，區同意，指出是「分組點票」制度。馬續指，同樣情況亦適用於引用《權力及特權法》成立專責委員會作調查，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意陳志全投票前會詳閱議案文件&quot;&gt;區同意陳志全投票前會詳閱議案文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉最後向區諾軒指出辯方案情，指陳志全每次在投票前，都會仔細考慮議案及預算案的內容。主控萬德豪質疑問題太籠統和問及個人意見，法官陳慶偉遂改問：「你與陳志全曾在立法會共事，以你們的關係，他是一個盡職盡責（conscientious）的議員，他是否於投票前均會仔細審視相關文件？」區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區表示無聽過陳志全提及會無差別否決財案&quot;&gt;區表示無聽過陳志全提及會無差別否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指出，以區諾軒所知，陳志全從沒說過任何關於會無差別否決預算案的言論。控方問是否談及二人對話，法官李運騰遂將問題改為：區有沒有聽過陳志全提及，若當選的話會無差別否決財政預算案？區表示沒有聽過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬再指出，若政府願意提出落實普選、全民退休保障計劃、反性傾向和種族歧視、同性婚姻等議案，陳志全是否必定會投票支持。李運騰打斷指他將太多問題放在一起，令問題過於揣測（speculative），陳慶偉亦指辯方已指出陳投票前會仔細考慮法案文件，「你怎能問這條問題（指陳必定會支持）？」林卓廷大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬最後再指，若政府推動與陳志全政治主張相符的議案，陳會支持，李運騰質疑他是否有必要問，即使證人回答亦沒有價值，又指馬的第一條問題已達到目的，最後馬表示已完成盤問。案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;墨落無悔稱支持度低須停選舉工程-區認屬政治常識多年嚟選民都做策略投票&quot;&gt;墨落無悔稱支持度低須停選舉工程 區認屬政治常識：多年嚟選民都做策略投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，馬維騉今亦就陳志全在 Facebook 張貼的「墨落無悔」聲明書發問，區同意該聲明的作者在選詞用字上沒有諮詢過他，對曾否諮詢過戴耀廷亦沒有相關資訊，並同意馬指「墨落無悔」與初選組織者無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;聲明列明，參選人「若支持度跌出各區預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」。被問讓支持度低的參選人避免浪費支出是否政治現實或常識，區指「如果你覺得自己冇辦法當選，就冇必要繼續花費落去」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問，落敗者不能繼續選舉工程不正是「35+」其中一個目標嗎？區解釋協調機制分為兩階段，首階段是初選勝出者據協議數目報名參選立會，其中新東目標贏6席、派7隊參選；第二階段則是正式選舉前，據民調結果決定最後支持6隊還是7隊參選，若排名低於第7隊，就不能繼續參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，因此「墨落無悔」相關要求基本上是與35+「共同綱領」的所謂共識相符？區指「係有呢個背景喺裏面」，並同意陳仲衡指35+其中一個目標亦是不希望浪費選票。馬維騉總結，勝算低者停止選舉工程、避免浪費選票均是過往選舉已沿用的政治常識，區指該想法是基於多年來香港選民都會「策略投票」，集中選票予最有勝算者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「墨落無悔」列明「我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，馬維騉一度問該「會」的意思是強或弱，惟陳慶偉指區並非作者不能回答。區亦同意李運騰指出，港島楊雪盈在初選落敗後仍報名參選，是有違「35+」精神。楊的名字有出現在「墨落無悔」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;35公民投票文件無提否決權-惟區不同意是提名表列明參選人須認同的文件&quot;&gt;「35+公民投票」文件無提否決權 惟區不同意是提名表列明參選人須認同的文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉亦展示陳志全的提名表格，當中列明「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」。區早前在大律師沈士文盤問下同意，沒有一份文件以「民主派35+公民投票計劃」命名，據其理解該「計劃」是指涉各區共同綱領。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉今展示從趙家賢電話搜得、題為「民主派35+公民投票」的文件，談及初選提名和投票的日程和安排、各區目標議席等，又指在中央直接為港制定《國安法》的情勢下，參選人被DQ風險大增，籲所有熱愛民主的港人積極參與投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指案發時曾看過該文件一次，推斷應在6月頭到中旬寫好，確認文件沒有提及使用否決權，亦無提及「35+計劃」的意識形態。李運騰問文件對象是參選人還是大眾，區指「我連份文件畀邊個我都唔清楚」，最初想過是否予傳媒；至於文件由誰撰寫，區稱：「好大機會係民主動力嗰邊嘅人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續問，故提名表格條款上「民主派35+公民投票計劃」是否指這份文件，區不同意，重申他一直的理解都是指各區共同綱領。區亦同意，新東就否決財政預算案沒有共識，僅對舉辦初選、議席數目、替補機制及舉辦選舉論壇有共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">區諾軒改稱不希望使用「騎劫」字眼 「結果又傷害戴耀廷」 區諾軒：「攬炒十步」是戴耀廷狂想、Final Fantasy 多名被告大笑 辯方指民主派奪半或被DQ拘捕 區諾軒引張炳良書指「民主路要談判先有機會」</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第廿六日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-16-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-26.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第廿六日】" /><published>2023-03-16T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-03-16T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-26</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-16-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-26.html">&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;區諾軒稱感覺被戴耀廷「騎劫」、指完全實現五大訴求「唔現實」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zN4NaTg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（16日）踏入審訊第26天。區諾軒繼續接受代表陳志全的大狀盤問，辯方庭上展示戴耀廷發出的新界東協調文件，列明「會運用」權力否決預算案，區諾軒稱此時才知悉並非「會積極運用」；又指他和社民連陳寶瑩等曾在會上對否決預算案提出質疑，被問是否認為戴耀廷「騎劫」會上反對意見，區指「確實係有呢個感覺」，指戴沒有尊重會上不同聲音。區又強調不能勉強人否決，形容戴耀廷有「盲點」，因戴沒有像他一樣接觸功能組別候選人並理解他們真正需要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，區表示雖「五大訴求 缺一不可」是示威者口號，但要完全實現是「唔現實」，指「政治始終係要有談判同妥協」，「民主嘅路始終係要一步一步走」；又指情況「接近一個死局」，舉例有大學校長曾與特首商討設立獨立調查委員會亦未能實現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱2019年12月戴耀廷文章主要目標-為立會奪半後爭真普選&quot;&gt;辯方稱2019年12月戴耀廷文章主要目標 為立會奪半後爭真普選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今繼續接受代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉盤問。就初選的背景，馬指據區所說，初選源於戴耀廷2019年12月的文章〈立會奪半 走向真普選重要一步〉，並問戴耀廷願景的主要目標，是否立會奪半後爭取真普選？區答「公道」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，雖然馬問及區對文章的理解，但事實上法庭亦可有自己的理解，並主動提出文章也有提及「不求一次決戰就取得勝利，而是一點點地削弱中共對香港的箝制」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉指他並非要斷章取義，着區看文章如何開始和收結，並問文章予「一般讀者」的印象。惟法官陳仲衡再打斷，指「我們都是讀者」，辯方只能問及區的個人印象。馬再改問區，戴是否很想實現普選，區指在文章中「佢希望達致真普選嘅目標係好明確嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱完全實現五大訴求不現實接近死局&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱完全實現五大訴求不現實、接近死局&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒同意爭取真普選是反對派自2014年已有的目標，亦是「五大訴求」之一，「五大訴求 缺一不可」是示威者常用口號。馬維騉續問，會否有人即使只有一兩個訴求獲回應亦會接受，區稱「我唔排除社會上面有一定程度嘅人咁諗」。馬續問區：「你不會幻想（dream）全部五大訴求獲得回應吧？」李運騰反問「那不正是35+的目標嗎？」，問辯方是否真的要問那個問題，馬確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KLoaBFK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 代表陳志全的大律師 馬維騉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指：「我認為現實政治上完全實現五大訴求係唔現實嘅，因為始終都要政府回應，我亦都相信政府唔會完全接受晒五大訴求嘅全部內容。」李運騰兩度問區是否即不認為有合理機會能實現「五大訴求 缺一不可」，區答「政治始終係要有談判同妥協」，又言「睇你點睇當中嘅訴求啦，就我而言，最終極嘅目標係我要真普選啦，但民主嘅路始終係要一步一步走嘅」，並指：「如果你問我喺2019到20年嘅情境底下，政府忽然話聽日就有普選呢，係唔現實嘅，至少喺程序上面都有好多個關卡要走，亦都要顧及香港社會各界嘅意見。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱大學校長曾與特首談及設獨立調委員會-惟未能實現&quot;&gt;區稱大學校長曾與特首談及設獨立調委員會 惟未能實現&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指不是談普選，而是認為「五大訴求 缺一不可」能否落實，區搖頭並加重語氣：「係一個好難嘅機會。」李問是否即是一個死局（deadlock）？區稱「接近一個死局」，舉例指除撤回《逃犯條例》以外，相信最易達成的目標就是「設立獨立調查委員會」，惟2019年8月一班大學校長去禮賓府談及相關問題，「似乎終歸都未能實現」，「所以五大訴求係唔容易實現嘅目標。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉指上述文章只是提及「走向重要一步」，相信在政治現實上沒有人會認為真普選會在一夜間實現，區同意是「合理的理解」。法官陳慶偉續指，戴耀廷文章亦有提及立法會有「財政權」和「調查權」，能否說當時運用「財政權」已在戴耀廷腦海出現、是其議程的首位（top of his agenda）？區回應「有喺佢個腦海裏出現」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒確認與戴耀廷不曾就初選諮詢陳志全&quot;&gt;區諾軒確認與戴耀廷不曾就初選諮詢陳志全&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續就2020年1月區諾軒與戴耀廷的飯局發問，提到戴當時辦初選，是望作為推行公民投票制度的「試點案例（pilot case）」，區同意。馬續問戴是否望選民能透過公民投票就社福議題表達意見，區指戴是想設立一個公民表達意見的平台，「內容係冇前設嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，戴耀廷和區諾軒在2020年2月至4月開始接觸有意參選的民主派，並形容為「游說階段」。區修正為「諮詢」，並指該階段於3月已完結，而當時是諮詢人們是否有意參與初選，及若辦初選會有何關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意在此「諮詢階段」，無論他或戴耀廷均沒有諮詢陳志全意見。他同意馬指，2至3月通常是立法會議員就預算案辯論的時間，投票一般在4至5月進行，而陳作為盡責的議員，無疑忙於開會，但區也知道陳志全有意參與2020年立法會選舉新界東選區。區在李運騰詢問下，亦表示首名接觸的人力成員是譚得志，曾透過《D100》 電郵聯絡他出席九東協調會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳志全派代表出席新東會議區冇印象首次會議有否談及否決權&quot;&gt;陳志全派代表出席新東會議、區「冇印象」首次會議有否談及否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續就新界東於4月14日及5月5日的兩次協調會議發問。區同意他兩次均有出席，首次有近20人，第二次起碼超過20人，而陳志全只派代表出席，首次派議員助理蘇浩。辯方指陳在第二次會議派蘇浩和劉嘉鴻出席，區指他只記得蘇，不記得有劉，亦對蘇兩次會議曾否發言「冇印象」。辯方問及有否在會上傳閱35+文件，區指就新界東而言，「我係直程呢啲文件嘅發送我都係冇印象嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8HCuXF2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 陳志全&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，「冇印象」在首次會議，運用否決權的議題有否被提出或討論。至於第二次會議，他同意會前社民連黃浩銘曾致電他要求勿認同否決預算案，而會上鄒家成提出為何用「會積極」而非「會」的字眼，並特別指向與會的民主黨和街工，有人提出「行禮如儀」；在該討論下，代表社民連的陳寶瑩「企出嚟，講出佢質疑嘅立場」，即若政府推行全民退保社民連會支持，街工盧藝賢亦表示該黨望保障草根基層收入，不會否決對基層有利的預算案，林卓廷的代表莊榮輝則稱中委會無授權他去處理相關問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，他其後提出質疑，指「唔能夠勉強人哋一定會否決財政預算案」，因若談及「35+」，無可避免會包括功能組別參選人，而他們有其業界利益。區指戴耀廷沒有針對他的看法回應，但有做整體的回應，即嘗試以「會積極」的用字迎合各人分歧。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區質疑不能勉強人否決-稱戴耀廷想法有盲點無理解參選功能組別人士需要&quot;&gt;區質疑不能勉強人否決 稱戴耀廷想法有「盲點」、無理解參選功能組別人士需要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續問，那戴的看法是否與3月31日〈立會過半是「大殺傷力憲制武器」〉文章背道而馳？陳官指戴在2019年12月的文章提及可運用「財政權」和「調查權」，其後「演進」至3月31日文章，只談及一種權力（財政權）。區先答「推論而言，可以咁講」，但續指「我諗佢又好，大家都好，都未必諗得咁嚴密」，重申戴的動機是想「說服唔同分歧」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區並指，「我會話佢（戴耀廷）嘅矛盾，反映佢有一個盲點，就係佢有冇真係聽過想參選功能組別嘅人真正嘅需要」，並解釋自己當時表示不能勉強人否決預算案，「就係因為有接觸呢一班人（功能組別參選人）。他（戴耀廷）是沒有（接觸）的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪一度指，區諾軒「嚴密」一字被翻譯作「serious」，但應用「meticulous」，區舉起左手稱「我提議係 rigorous」，多名被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問社民連及人力政治主張有何不同-區諾軒稱問題難答二者同屬進步民主派&quot;&gt;官問社民連及人力政治主張有何不同 區諾軒稱問題難答、二者同屬進步民主派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續提及，2016年立法會選舉，陳志全與社民連梁國雄組成選舉聯盟參選，區同意兩黨政治立場相似，直至2020年亦同樣。馬續指出，陳志全的代表於第二次新東會議，亦有表達與社民連相近的看法，區指「抱歉我係冇印象嘅，不過如果佢係出嚟講返個會係啲乜，咁我覺得都係合理嘅 」。馬問雖然區不記得，是否預期該代表會有相似看法？控方指證人已答過，亦是問及其意見；法官陳慶偉着馬留待陳詞，李運騰亦指即使證人答出辯方想要的答案，也只是個人意見和估計，不認為對議題有幫助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時陳慶偉問，「我只是好奇，他們（社民連和人民力量）政治主張有何不同？」區猶豫：「嗯……」多名被告大笑，有人說「好難答」，區亦俯身向證人台，邊低頭邊笑說：「真係好難答。」李運騰再問，區指兩黨經常攜手合作，那兩者有何分別。區雙手合十思考片刻，笑說「我試吓講啦」，陳慶偉一度指如他不知道可以提出，指可能只是政治上的便利（political convenience）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，可以將兩黨歸類為「進步民主派」，李運騰問是否即一個比另一個「進步」，區再答：「但大家都知道佢哋兩個政團成立嘅歷史，人民力量係由社民連分裂出嚟嘅，所以政治議題上面應該係有一啲睇法嘅分別嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉指區就分裂的說法並不正確，何桂藍面露驚訝。陳慶偉問因此區是不知道兩者分別？區指2016年後「的確好難有清楚嘅分別」，因人民力量只餘下陳志全任議員，社民連則沒有，「我哋好難從平常嘅立場、行為去評價佢哋嘅分別。」馬其後指，若說兩黨屬同一政治光譜，唯一的分別只是個人的差異，區答：「佢哋叫做光譜相似啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱庭上看辯方展示文件-才知道新東採用會運用字眼&quot;&gt;區稱庭上看辯方展示文件 才知道新東採用「會運用」字眼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後就新界東協調文件發問。馬維騉首度展示一份「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新界東協調機制協議」的文件，問戴耀廷是否曾在第二次新東會議後向所有與會者發送，區指「冇呢樣嘢」。馬再指是於會議兩日後發送，區稱「我冇印象」，亦表示「我的確係未睇過呢份文件」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰反問：「從來沒有？」區指，戴耀廷在6月9日記者會前曾在組織者群組發出各區協調文件，他曾開過但不確知是哪個，而當時印象是各區文件內容類似，均提及「會積極運用」《基本法》權力，僅新界西後來改為「會運用」權力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過辯方展示的文件，顯示「參與此協調機制的個人或團體，認同若民主派能取得立法會一半議席，『會運用』基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求，特赦抗爭者、令相關人士為警暴問責、及重啟政改以達雙普選」，區承認「我都係啱啱睇到呢份文件」，才得悉新東是用「會運用」字眼，與其印象不一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰要求展示組織者 WhatsApp 群組訊息，顯示戴於6月8日下午約1時半，接連發出「35+新西final」、「35+九西final」和「35+新東final」等多個檔案，問區辯方展示的是否該附件。區重申當時應沒有開過檔案，否則他就會注意到新東文件使用「會運用」的字眼。惟他亦表示，現時檔案呈現面前，會令他思考辯方展示的文件或就是戴發出的文件。馬維騉指相關檔案是從趙家賢的手機擷取。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區認戴耀廷以會積極字眼迎合人-惟無法解釋文件為何不用會積極&quot;&gt;區認戴耀廷以「會積極」字眼迎合人 惟無法解釋文件為何不用「會積極」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續問，故該份文件提及「會運用」權力否決預算案，是否未有反映新東第二次會議上不同黨派的矛盾看法？區同意，指「我至少睇唔到點樣大家同意『會運用』呢個字眼」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區亦同意，戴耀廷曾在各區會議用「會積極運用」來迎合不同人分歧，指該權力「可以用，可以唔用」，若政府不聽民意就可運用，形容「比起唔講任何嘢都行前一步」。區同意該情況與他昨天稱若有人對預算案感到滿意，或不會否決的說法相符。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，即在新東第二次會議，戴耀廷是想使用「會積極」的字眼以盡量迎合更多人？區同意，但指「我的確解釋唔到」為何辯方展示的文件並沒有「會積極」的字眼，而該文件亦沒有顯示為「初稿」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問戴耀廷是否騎劫反對否決預算案意見-區確實係有呢個感覺&quot;&gt;辯方問戴耀廷是否騎劫反對否決預算案意見 區：確實係有呢個感覺&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉再問，使用「會運用」一字，是否即無視反對的意見？區稱「可以咁理解」。馬再問，是否在「騎劫（hijack）」協調會議？法官李運騰打斷問是指誰在騎劫，是戴耀廷、其他人抑或區諾軒。馬續指，是戴耀廷騎劫協調會議上部分反對意見，區點頭：「我確實係有呢個感覺。」李運騰指法庭不關注感覺，而是區諾軒是否知悉，區猶豫說：「我唔講……點講呢……總的來說……」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬問區怎能知道是否騎劫，只能談及印象，惟李運騰指每個人都可以有他的印象，但法庭不是按印象來作裁決，質疑區的印象有何證據價值。馬回應望指出文件無法準確反映會議，李運騰則指可以是疏忽（oversight），但要問作者才知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續問，區指感覺被「騎劫」，是否指文件沒有充分反映會議內容，區表示據他案發時的立場「我冇理由同意一個『會運用』《基本法》權力嘅字眼嘅」。李運騰再問文件是否不能反映會上不同意見？區同意，解釋「我嘅唔同意係建基於與會人士有唔同嘅意見」。他並略激動指，他在6月9日記者會沒有反對「會積極運用」的字眼，是因為其意思有一定的彈性，「但係你係用『會運用』嘅時候呢，我就會有個感覺，係咪冇尊重到會入面唔同嘅聲音。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問會是否可指可能或必定等-區會就係會&quot;&gt;辯方問「會」是否可指「可能」或「必定」等 區：會就係會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續提及，區諾軒曾供稱「會運用」權力否決預算案可有三個意思，包括「會否決」、「會為了爭取五大訴求而否決」和「會無差別否決」，而區亦曾指用「會」一字可減低但不是消除「模糊性」，區同意，並稱「睇你『會』嘅目標係咩啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續問，區會否同意「會」一字，可解作「可能（may）」、「必定（shall）」及「會（will）」的意思？區答「會就係會」，陳志全等發笑。馬再指，但會或不會運用否決權的可能性是否仍存在，惟控方及法官均指證人已回答，區並再補充：「我從來講法係如果『會運用』就係『會運用』，但『會運用』係為咗乜嚟運用……」陳慶偉指那就是另一回事，即「動機」的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區認無就會上否決預算案意見與陳志全聯絡無向其助理查證&quot;&gt;區認無就會上否決預算案意見與陳志全聯絡、無向其助理查證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後展示「35+計劃新東訊息發布區」的 WhatsApp 紀錄，顯示陳志全只曾發出兩個訊息，包括向區諾軒就選舉論壇的安排說「Thx」，以及在初選後的2020年7月13日，發布一個「info.gov.hk」的政府網頁連結，區指沒有印象有開過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬問及，區有否向陳志全確認他知悉協調會議上的內容，區答他「冇記得咁詳細」，但應該有通知所有持分者，他們才能來開會；至於會上就否決預算案的不同意見，區承認「冇就有關事宜同佢（陳志全）有直接聯絡」。馬再問區有否向陳的助理查證，他有否將會上的不同意見向陳志全準確傳達，區指他沒有特別查證。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒無與陳志全討論選舉論壇&quot;&gt;區諾軒無與陳志全討論選舉論壇&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒早前亦稱，港島區協調會議有人民力量成員出席，區確認該區最終沒有人力成員參選。馬續指區的說法出錯，只因該些人曾在很久以前任譚得志義工，才誤以為他們是人力成員，並指其中一名女士叫「Dorda」。區指他不認識，亦不記得有誰出席，只記得有兩名中年男女，有人一開始表示「想學吓嘢」，但再沒有參與會議的討論。區亦表示，就選舉論壇沒有與陳志全特別有私人對話，主要依賴群組發布的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">區諾軒稱感覺被戴耀廷「騎劫」、指完全實現五大訴求「唔現實」</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第廿五日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-15-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-25.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第廿五日】" /><published>2023-03-15T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-03-15T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-25</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-15-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-25.html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第25天，區諾軒繼續接受代表黃碧雲及林卓廷的大律師沈士文盤問。初選提名表格要求參選人認同協調會議共識及擁護《基本法》等才能參選，區今指該「協調會議共識」視乎各區而定，而九龍西和新界東就否決預算案「確有分歧」。提名表格亦要求參選人認同「民主派35+公民投票計劃」及其目標，區指是指涉各區提及否決預算案的「共同綱領」，但承認此前沒有文件以此為名或提及相關字眼，他亦沒有向參選人解釋。區亦同意，林卓廷和黃碧雲在表格夾附的單張沒提及否決預算案，林卓廷在論壇上亦曾指視乎具體議案投票，區同意他不會無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒同意參選人毋須就否決預算案條款回應&quot;&gt;區諾軒同意參選人毋須就否決預算案條款回應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今繼續接受代表黃碧雲及林卓廷的大律師沈士文盤問。就協調文件，區同意組織者沒要求參選人就協調文件上「會積極運用權力否決財政預算案」的相關條款作出回應，該份文件亦沒有公開，戴耀廷在6月9日記者會上亦指參與者毋須簽署任何文件。他並同意辯方指，參選人沒需要公開回應相關條文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就提名表格，區諾軒同意由趙家賢草擬，他和戴耀廷審視及認可才發布，提名期是在6月9日記者會後4天，於6月13日至20日舉行，區並確認收到黃碧雲及林卓廷的提名表格。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;提名表格稱認同民主派35公民投票計劃-區指涉各區共同綱領&quot;&gt;提名表格稱認同「民主派35+公民投票計劃」 區：指涉各區共同綱領&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文其後引述提名表格，顯示「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」及「我特此聲明，我會擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特別行政區」條款，區確認參選人要同意相關條款才能參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就條款提及的「民主派35+公民投票計劃」，沈士文指其名字與最初的「35+計劃」文件（註：該文件沒提否決預算案）相似，區同意。法官陳慶偉問「35+計劃」與「民主派35+公民投票計劃」是否指同一份文件，區指前者是協調會早期的文件，但「我哋始終冇辦法迴避6月9號記者招待會，戴耀廷係有指涉到有一份文件，而去到嗰陣時呢，（該份指涉的文件）已經係去到各個區嘅共同綱領啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DDJmMoF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 戴耀廷（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，故「民主派35+公民投票計劃」是否只是一個「一般性（generic）」的說法，抑或是指向一份特定的文件？區重申根據6月9日記者會，指涉的文件「已經去到各區嘅共同綱領」。陳續指提名表格或於記者會前設計，是否設計時已考慮該記者會的內容。區指始終是由民主動力負責設計，亦的確沒有水晶球知道記者會發生的事，但重申該條款的精神，「就係總結協調會裡面討論嘅過程，以及希望參與者同意最後嘅共識」，並同意當時「會／會積極」運用否決權條款已包括在各區共同綱領內。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，條款中提及「及其目標」，組織者心中有沒有特定的「目標」？區重申「都係去返各區嘅共同綱領」，並同意法官李運騰所指，包括「五大訴求，缺一不可」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱文件無註腳需解說才明白指涉為何-區認無向參選人解釋&quot;&gt;辯方稱文件無註腳、需解說才明白指涉為何 區認無向參選人解釋&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文其後展示九西的共同綱領，題為「35+立會過半計劃 民主派九龍西協調機制協議」，並指曾出現「35+計劃」文件及協調機制初稿。區確認計劃過程中的確曾出現過幾個文件版本，但沒有一份文件以「民主派35+公民投票計劃」為題，或提及該字眼。法官陳仲衡一度指，理解一直都是同一個計劃，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續指，由於表格上就「民主派35+公民投票計劃」沒有註腳（footnote），而整個計劃亦沒有文件提過此字眼，是否代表參與者需組織者解說，才會知道該字眼指涉什麼文件？區回應，文件的確沒有明確指涉，「若當時有人叫我解釋，咁我就會指涉返去共同綱領嗰份文件」，但他在陳仲衡詢問下，確認當時沒有收到這樣的要求，他亦沒有向其他人解釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;提名表格要求認同協調會議共識-區指視乎各區而定九西新東就否決財案有分歧&quot;&gt;提名表格要求認同協調會議共識 區指視乎各區而定、九西新東就否決財案有分歧&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文又指，條款的重點為「共識」，即參選人要同意協調會及35+計劃的「共識」，區指毋庸置疑該句的邏輯關係是以「共識」為先。沈續指，故如協調會議上就否決預算案沒有共識，那表格上認同的共識亦不包括否決預算案。區答「所以要睇返參選人本身嘅睇法係乜嘢」，沈指即是要視乎個別選區共識？區指「可以咁樣理解」。他並同意，九龍西和新界東就否決預算案「確有分歧」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文其後展示黃碧雲和林卓廷夾附在提名表格的選舉單張，其中前者寫有「反抗專政 緊抱自由」，後者則有「查警黑 制警暴 止警謊」、「五大訴求 缺一不可」等，區確認，兩者均沒有提及否決預算案，亦與他早前供稱所理解的民主黨立場一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林卓廷黃碧雲選舉單張無提否決預算案林論壇稱視乎具體議案投票&quot;&gt;林卓廷黃碧雲選舉單張無提否決預算案、林論壇稱視乎具體議案投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈再引述初選論壇上，林卓廷回應嘉賓對他不會全面抗爭的質疑，林稱「我諗我哋要睇番具體嘅議案，具體嘅政策」，又指「如果政府話『每個香港人派三萬蚊』，我覺得一定要投贊成票喎，冇理由留返啲錢畀政府去做大白象工程㗎嘛」。法官陳慶偉問，根據林的回應，是否同意他不會無差別否決預算案，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文其後指，組織者是否收過74份提名表格，區指「我冇真係數過，但的確收到好多」，並同意每名參選人都要簽署提名表格，至於同一張名單之後的候選人要否簽則不確定。辯方其後展示林卓廷名單中黃凱盈的提名表格，區遂確認所有名單上的人都要簽署提名表格，並同意5個地方選區、超區和衞生服務界共74名參選人均簽署提名表格，並同樣表示支持及認同計劃共識。法官陳仲衡問，那黃凱盈要否未付1萬元按金，區答「應該係一個團隊畀一次嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前自辯的劉偉聰盤問後祝區諾軒順利，沈士文今盤問結束後亦向區諾軒致謝，祝他平安、健康（“Thank you Mr. Au, I wish you peace and good health.”），法官陳慶偉着他之後不要再提該些言論（“Can you skip all those remarks in the future?”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒其後接受代表施德來的大律師黃廷光盤問，案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第25天。區諾軒接受代表陳志全和施德來的大狀盤問，同意至今仍視陳志全為朋友，指陳「唔係真係好激進」，核心政治信念是推動同志平權、亦爭取實施全民退保，認為政府若推行全民退保，而陳衡量後認為整體利多於弊，有贊成預算案的可能。區亦同意，民協是影響力較小的溫和民主派，施德來是「和理非」，在法官詢問下解釋「和勇不分」是令反修例運動持續的條件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在法官陳慶偉詢問下亦表示，他2020年7月15日退出初選工作後，原打算於同年10月赴日展開博士生的生活，指當時「我嘅人生計劃係離開政壇」。陳續問，區是否不會親眼見證整個「攬炒十步」的過程，區答「唔會，同埋我都唔想（此事）喺香港發生」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區至今仍視陳志全是朋友-指同志平權是其核心政治信念&quot;&gt;區至今仍視陳志全是朋友 指同志平權是其核心政治信念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今接受代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉盤問。馬先表示會問簡單問題，望區諾軒簡潔回答，區稱「我會努力」，馬並稱會以「Raymond」來稱呼陳志全。區諾軒在馬的提問下同意，與陳志全曾任立法會同事，二人屬民主派，就社福議題有相近立場，亦經常一起工作、吃飯、定期交談。馬其後問，二人是否有一同玩「Pokémon GO」的手機遊戲，陳志全、余慧明、林卓廷等多名被告發笑，區亦俯身笑稱「係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/np0hT7b.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 陳志全&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意視陳志全為朋友，直至現在仍是，認為他友善、理性，亦是立法會其中一個最勤力的議員，指「佢嘅工作係受到梁君彥肯定嘅」，林卓廷等起鬨，有人發笑及說「嘩」。馬維騉指，其實就是時任立法會主席梁君彥讚陳志全是民主派最勤力議員，而幾乎眾所周知，陳的會議出席率近乎100%，區均指「正確」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，民主派可被稱為泛民、非建制派及反對派，而陳志全於2012年當選新界東立法會議員，不久後「出櫃」，公開宣布他是一名男同志。馬續指，陳志全幾乎整個任期都非常積極推動同志平權，亦很重視同志權利，區同意，指這是其「核心嘅政治信念」，亦同意陳為推動性小眾議題需經常與政府及建制派合作，舉例政府曾找陳志全做諮詢，陳亦曾與葉劉淑儀交流，區亦同意同志平權議題是「全方位」，涉稅務、出入境、房屋等問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，如果政府就反歧視或性小眾平權等作回應，陳志全是否會毫不猶豫支持，區同意，亦同意陳亦希望政府實施全民退休保障，並就該議題與社民連和他自己均站在較前線的位置。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指陳志全唔係真係好激進&quot;&gt;區諾軒指陳志全「唔係真係好激進」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，陳志全2016年續任立法會議員，他是人民力量主席，與譚得志一同主持電台節目，分別綽號「慢必」和「快必」。馬續問，從二人姓名是否可反映他們不同，區說「據我認識佢哋都係唔同嘅」，馬欲繼續追問，惟陳慶偉指不相關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區其後同意，由於人民力量比傳統泛民較為「進步」，故可歸類為「進步民主派」，亦同意因陳志全是該黨唯一立會議員，故是該黨的「標誌」。馬維騉問陳是否並非激進（radical），區答「佢都唔係真係好激進」，陳志全苦笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱退出初選工作後原計劃離開政壇-不會見證亦不想攬炒十步在港發生&quot;&gt;區稱退出初選工作後原計劃離開政壇 不會見證亦不想攬炒十步在港發生&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後提到區是公共政策博士，其研究範疇包括亞洲的全民退保。此時法官陳慶偉打斷指，區曾稱於2020年7月15日退出初選工作，那他研究生的計劃是怎樣的？區指，「我本身打算喺2020年10月嘅時候，開始我博士生嘅生活」，計劃飛去日本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指，原本立會選舉於同年9月舉行，假設一切如期舉行，區是否仍會在立會選舉後飛去日本？區答：「我本身已經計劃咗離開香港，甚至可以咁講⋯⋯當我決定離開、退出呢個35+工作啦，我嘅人生計劃係離開政壇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，換言之，即區不會親眼見證整個「攬炒十步」的過程？（“You would not see the 10 steps mutual destruction through?”）區搖頭答：「唔會，同埋我都唔想喺香港發生。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒同意若政府推全民退保-權衡利害後會支持&quot;&gt;區諾軒同意若政府推全民退保 權衡利害後會支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續就全民退保發問，區同意他重視全民退保，社民連亦曾表示若政府推行全民退保，會支持預算案。馬續問區，若政府在預算案推行全民退保，他會否投下支持票？區答「我會支持」，「如果我仲係立法會議員，我就會喺財政預算案度投支持票」。法官李運騰笑着問，「不論議案內容？（Regardless of the content？）」吳政亨、陳志全和彭卓棋等隨即大笑，區答：「因為政府會做全民退保嘅政策，所以我會支持呢個預算案。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續指，預算案可能有其他項目，如要求議員減薪，區續指「呢個就係同政府談判嘅重要啦」。李運騰問是否只能全部贊成或反對，不能選擇性支持？區指終歸會去到投「贊成、反對或棄權」的議程，但此前有很多程序可以向政府討價還價；而議員雖沒有提案的權力，但也可促請政府修改方案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，是否即預算案內其他項目不能提反對，區指若有反對的項目，可以在二讀和三讀提出修正，包括刪減預算案的預算。李問政府不同意怎麼辦？區答：「我會權衡利害，若果全民退保嘅益處大於我唔想要嘅一啲項目，我都會投支持。」馬維騉總結即議案是「好大於壞（doing more good than evil）」，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區舉民政事務委員會撥款例子-指曾在立法會說服並獲陳志全支持&quot;&gt;區舉民政事務委員會撥款例子 指曾在立法會說服並獲陳志全支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續問，以區諾軒與陳志全的友誼，若政府在預算案推行全民退休保障，是否預期陳會支持。法官陳仲衡質疑區在不知道預算案內容的情況下不能回答，主控萬德豪亦指證人不能就此發表個人意見。法官陳慶偉續指，若不知道預算案所有項目的內容，相信區不能回答「他的朋友 Raymond」會否選擇否決預算案，因為這純粹是一個「互相讓步（give and take）」的過程。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，但認為公允地說，有一件事可予法庭參考。他續指曾任南區區議員的自己，很支持政府推動的一億元重點項目工程，而他於2019年9月任立法會民政事務委員會副主席，曾與時任民政事務局局長劉江華開會商討一年議程，當時他向政府保證，若政府將一億重點工程與南區工務工程，包括黃竹坑泳池興建優先放上議程，讓他在離任前能順利討論，「我會說服民主派嘅議員贊成，亦都唔好喺財委會嗰度作出冗長嘅提問。」區指，最終相關項目有放上議程，亦順利在財委會通過，而「陳志全就係其中一個我說服到嘅民主派議員」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問政府推全民退保陳志全是否會支持-區稱若認為利多於弊有可能&quot;&gt;辯方問政府推全民退保陳志全是否會支持 區稱若認為利多於弊有可能&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒早前供稱，陳志全和社民連梁國雄曾在政府答應派1萬元後停止拉布。馬維騉再次問，以區和陳的友誼，若政府在預算案推行全民退保，是否預期陳會支持。區指「如果佢認為（除全民退保外的其他項目）利多於弊，咁佢都有投贊成票嘅可能」，法官陳仲衡指他是回答可能性，區同意「始終冇發生」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬再問，陳志全如此重視同志平權，若政府提出保障性小眾權利的議案，陳是否毫無疑問會贊成？法官陳慶偉指不會容許此問題，李運騰亦指太過籠統及屬猜測（speculative），陳慶偉補充是「高度猜測（highly speculative）」，馬指會留待陳詞。李運騰續指，區已回答會權衡利害，陳仲衡亦指辯方似乎是在度身訂造一份陳志全會投贊成的預算案。馬維騉指他只是強調陳志全的政治主張，惟陳慶偉着他回去想想，明早再問些更好的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指辯方問題猜測-辯方反駁控方案情亦是猜測-官指視乎證據&quot;&gt;控方指辯方問題猜測 辯方反駁控方案情亦是猜測 官指視乎證據&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，馬維騉是否想表示陳志全就預算案是有商量的餘地（open to negotiation），並會理性考慮對預算案立場，問他為何不直接問。馬同意是他盤問其中一個目的，續問區諾軒會否同意陳志全在未知預算案的內容下，並不會無差別否決預算案。主控萬德豪即指問題高度猜測和假設性，區不能就此表達個人意見，陳慶偉同意，惟馬反駁，控方指被告會無差別否決預算案也是高度猜測。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指會將馬維騉的抗議紀錄在案，並指曾予馬時間思考，惟馬拒絕並問了一條非常差的問題（very bad question）。李運騰終指，控方案情能否成立視乎證據，指舉證責任在控方，若案情屬猜測亦不能成立，但那是法律的議題。案件明續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區形容民協溫和施德來是和理非-指和勇不分令反修例運動持續&quot;&gt;區形容民協「溫和」、施德來是「和理非」 指「和勇不分」令反修例運動持續&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃碧雲和林卓廷今早完成盤問後，區諾軒接受代表施德來的大律師黃廷光盤問。就民協的政治立場，區同意民協是較溫和的民主派，主要由區議員組成，較着重基層工作和民生議題，特別是深水埗的基層。區續指，2015至2016年許多公屋商場被領展轉賣予財團，民主派有聯合關注行動，他當時與民協合作並認識何啟明，施德來亦有參與其中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒同意認識施德來，並曾於2017年一同到台灣出席會議，當時施是民協主席。區指經多次合作，認識施的立場，指他曾因馮檢基而參與過好幾次立會選舉，馮其後離開民協，施「可以話係民協裡面嘅新生代」，又形容他是務實的區議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃廷光問施德來是否「和理非」，區點頭：「佢都係好和平、理性、非暴力嘅」，坐在施德來旁的彭卓棋隨即望向施發笑。此時法官李運騰問，區有否聽過「和理不分」，後更正為「和勇不分」，多名被告如彭卓棋、鄭達鴻等發笑，有人笑言「好嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，反修例運動參與者可分為和理非及勇武兩類，後者指「好主張直接行動嘅人」，他們不排拒暴力行動，法官李運騰問及例子，區指當時有人參與暴動或掟汽油彈。李運騰續指在初選論壇上不時聽見「和勇不分」，問區如何理解，區指反修例是持續的社會運動，很多時公眾集會出現暴力場面，「就有我哋叫做和理非嘅人去參與和平嘅遊行，呢種情況交替出現」，指「和勇不分」是令運動持續的條件。區同意據其理解，施直至2019年社會運動，亦一直維持和理非的主張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zSelj6N.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指民協影響力較小即使砌亦和平-同意與戴耀廷最初無接觸民協&quot;&gt;區指民協影響力較小、即使「砌」亦和平 同意與戴耀廷最初無接觸民協&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃廷光其後問區，有否聽過民協口號「又傾又砌」，區直言「聽過，而且好熟悉」，指「傾」是指民協很主張透過談判去爭取權益，但他們亦不排拒「砌」，即透過社會行動爭取權益。區並形容，民協是「好有歷史」的政黨，「即使講『砌』都好，都係一啲好和平嘅行動。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意在2016至2020年，民協沒有任何成員是立法會議員，亦同意他與戴耀廷最初接觸的民主黨派中，並不包括民協。黃廷光問為何不接觸民協，區指當時接洽目的是想了解不同人初步想法，「確實冇可能人人都接觸晒」，但不是刻意不接觸民協，之後辦協調會議也有開始聯絡民協成員。法官陳慶偉其後問及，區諾軒是否因民協影響力較小而沒有接觸，區同意民協是小政黨，影響力亦較小，並指當時連民協將有誰出選亦不掌握。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱第三次九東會議無詳細討論否決財案-戴提議加相關條款不獲參與者回應&quot;&gt;區稱第三次九東會議無詳細討論否決財案 戴提議加相關條款不獲參與者回應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後就協調會議發問，指區諾軒庭上供稱曾出席3次協調會議，但錄影會面提及只出席兩次。區解釋當時沒機會依賴 WhatsApp 紀錄及電話行事曆，答出並非正確的答案，但後來依賴予各被告的案情重組記憶，便確認有出席過3次。辯方指區沒有出席第三次會議，區稱「我記得我係有出席嘅」，又提議可按相關 WhatsApp 紀錄核對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指若辯方認為區是不誠實或記錯，便向他指出，黃廷光指並非去到那麼遠，只是看到有不妥的地方就盤問。法官其後要求區避席，關注辯方提問的相關性，黃廷光指不肯定區有出席第三次會議。李運騰質疑施德來若在場，為何辯方會不肯定，又指辯方有證據便可提出，但辯方承認其實沒有證據。陳慶偉又問及相關證供的意義，辯方指若區在場便會聽到戴耀廷提及否決預算案的話題，惟陳指辯方直接指出戴在會議沒有提及否決預算案便可，反問為何要轉彎抹角（beating the bush）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒其後再次入庭，黃廷光改問戴耀廷是否首兩次會議均沒有提及否決預算案，區同意，亦同意即使第三次會議戴有提及否決預算案，也沒有討論詳細內容，指「35+目標」非該次會議重點，而是談及如何宣傳。區在李運騰詢問下表示，戴耀廷當時指因為其他區都已在文件加入會積極用權否決預算案的條款，「所以九龍東都不如加返啦」，但沒有任何參與者作出回應，之後該條款亦加入九東「final」文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後問及九龍東候選人交表時夾附的共同綱領，區指是在參選人交表後，「我先為意有呢一份嘅文件」，並同意該文件並非官方文件，但與其他協調文件有一定相似性，均提及認同「五大訴求 缺一不可」，及會積極運用權力否決預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kim-jong-uns-political-control-of-the-north-korean-regime&quot;&gt;Kim Jong-un’s Political Control of the North Korean Regime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim Jong-un has consolidated power and appears more confident than ever. More than a decade ago, this outcome would have been largely unexpected, given that Kim Jong-un was relatively young (around 30 years old) and had only three years to prepare for leadership when his father, Kim Jong-il, suddenly died in December 2011. By comparison, Kim Jong-il was in his early 50s and had been in a grooming process for over 20 years when he took charge of the country when his father, Kim Il-sung, died in July 1994. Despite assessments that power consolidation would be challenging for this young, untested leader, Kim Jong-un attained six important titles that gave him firm control of the party, the state, and the military within the first six months of his rule — a period when he would have been the most vulnerable to attempted coups or other challenges to his leadership. In this regard, the recent surfacing of Kim’s daughter, Kim Ju-ae, could signal the start of a leadership grooming process of greater duration than what Ju-ae’s father enjoyed (elaborated below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since taking power over a decade ago, Kim Jong-un has used a number of tactics to further cement his hold on power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kim has relied on his nuclear and missile arsenal as an instrument of control. This has given him the capacity to both generate support and demonstrate confidence internally while signaling to foreign leaders that they will face significant risks if they challenge him.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kim has conducted brutal periodic purges of the leadership, including the executions of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, in 2013 and his minister of defense, Hyon Yong-chol, in 2015; the assassination of his brother, Kim Jong-nam, in 2017; the replacement of all of North Korea’s top military generals; and the reported purge (and possible execution) of former foreign minister Ri Yong-ho in recent months. These actions have been used to remove the confidants of his father and any others Kim has perceived as a threat and replace them with Kim loyalists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kim has “retired out” elder statesmen and arranged marital alliances for individuals in his close circle to orchestrate a generational shift within the regime. For instance, the son of Choe Ryong-hae, who currently serves as chairman on the Standing Committee of the Supreme People’s Assembly and first vice president of the State Affairs Commission, is reportedly married to Kim Jong-un’s sister, Kim Yo-jong.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To increase his popularity among the citizenry, Kim Jong-un has drawn on nostalgia among the public for his grandfather, Kim Il-sung. The grand-elder Kim had a grandiose and charismatic personality and ruled during a time when North Korea was not plagued by famine (as it was during Kim Jong-il’s rule) and had strong relations with its Cold War patrons, China and the Soviet Union. Kim Jong-un has made efforts to dress like his grandfather, and there have even been rumors that he underwent plastic surgery to look more like him.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kim Jong-un has tightened state control on information inflow into the country to enhance socialist ideological grip over its people and drive the country into further isolation. In December 2020, for instance, North Korea passed the “Law on the Elimination of Reactionary Thought and Culture” to clamp down on foreign influence. Anyone caught consuming or possessing foreign materials or cultural goods such as movies and dramas will be heavily punished. The law also banned foreign speech, hairstyle, and clothes, which Kim called a “dangerous poison.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Kim Jong-un’s successful efforts at power consolidation, the situation remains unpredictable and opaque, and it is likely that Kim’s confidence masks inner insecurity. His brutal form of rule comes with the heavy baggage of knowing that he needs to “clean house” periodically to ensure that officials around him are not only loyal but will fear consequences if they are ever tempted to challenge his leadership. Economically, Kim faces the dilemma that all dictators face: regime survival and prosperity necessitates a degree of economic opening, but the process of opening could precipitate the regime’s collapse. Furthermore, Kim’s moments of peak popularity with the public (to the degree they can be measured) have coincided with periods when the economy was improving and growing. The combined effects of the Covid-19-induced lockdown starting in January 2020, international sanctions, and severe weather in recent years have created the worst economic contraction since the period of the great famine of the 1990s. Collectively, these conditions make it likely that elites and the general public resent or even despise Kim, though they cannot express this outwardly. As a result, even as Kim displays a facade of boldness, he probably worries deep down about the security of his rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Kim faces the dilemma that all dictators face: regime survival and prosperity necessitates a degree of economic opening, but the process of opening could precipitate the regime’s collapse.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this situation, it is important to identify and look for future indicators that Kim Jong-un’s hold on power could be waning. These might include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;elite defections;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;erratic purges (shifting from Kim’s usual vacillations of promoting and demoting officials to something more dramatic and irregular);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;enhanced information and ideological control;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;increased defections or refugee outflows;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;generational tensions; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;public protest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last of these remains unlikely due to the regime’s extreme level of social control. However, given recent unpredicted popular protests in China against Covid-19 lockdown measures, social protest should remain on the list of possible developments that could weaken Kim’s control over the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-known-unknown-kim-jong-uns-health&quot;&gt;The Known Unknown: Kim Jong-un’s Health&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the biggest unknown concerning North Korean leadership is Kim Jong-un’s health, a variable that could take the form of death or incapacitation and that directly affects the trajectory of the other two variables: control and succession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim Jong-un has a number of health issues, including obesity, chain smoking, high blood pressure, gout, and a family history of diabetes and heart disease. When Kim met South Korean president Moon Jae-in at the Mount Paektu summit in 2018, he reportedly struggled to walk to and from the buses, perspiring profusely and breathing heavily. Kim lost some weight at one point, but more recently he seems to have gained it back (though it is important to keep in mind that, culturally, this might be viewed a sign of vitality in North Korea rather than a risk factor for an early death).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite his numerous medical conditions, it is difficult to speculate about when or how Kim may die or become incapacitated. The regime is opaque by design, and North Korea is one of the hardest intelligence targets in the world. The Central Intelligence Agency did not know about the passing of Kim Jong-un’s father, Kim Jong-il, until North Korea’s public announcement two days later. Periodically, Kim Jong-un “disappears” — as he did for a number of weeks in May 2020 — prompting much speculation about his condition. But even with the high level of attention these moments attract, top North Korea watchers rarely, if ever, have clear insights into the actual situation. Among experts, the perpetual answer to questions about Kim’s health is: “we do not know.” He is currently almost 39 years old (from experts’ best understanding), and his father and grandfather lived to the ages of 70 and 82, respectively. Considering that his father and grandfather had many of the same medical conditions as Kim Jong-un, he could be around for decades to come. Or, as one expert in the workshop noted, Kim “could just be one little sugar wafer away from [his] demise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important factor in determining the impact of Kim’s health on regime stability will be the timing of his death or incapacitation, specifically whether it occurs in his old age following a lengthy period of leadership transition or takes place unexpectedly and suddenly with no clearly identified successor. The latter situation would be the most precarious in terms of creating the potential for a failed succession process and regime instability. That said, while succession crisis scenarios must be kept in mind, one expert noted that the most probable outcome if Kim Jong-un were to die today would be a relatively smooth transition of power, perhaps to Kim Jong-un’s sister (discussed in further detail below). As in the past, the system is likely to perpetuate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;plans-for-leadership-succession&quot;&gt;Plans for Leadership Succession&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North Korean constitution does not enumerate a succession process; it is not institutionalized in the state. Yet there was a clear process to the two past successions prior to and following Kim Il-sung’s sudden death in 1994 and Kim Jong-il’s sudden death in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is currently no clear successor to Kim Jong-un. However, a number of developments in recent years have brought succession questions to the forefront, including the public debuts of Kim Jong-un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, his sister, Kim Yo-jong, and his 10-year-old daughter, Kim Ju-ae.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The North Korean constitution does not enumerate a succession process; it is not institutionalized in the state. Yet there was a clear process to the two past successions prior to and following Kim Il-sung’s sudden death in 1994 and Kim Jong-il’s sudden death in 2011.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel experts agreed that Kim Jong-un’s sister, Kim Yo-jong, would be the most likely transitional leader if her brother were to die or be incapacitated in the near term. Kim Yo-jong has had significant power within the system for a number of years. While her debut on the world stage occurred around 2018, she had been running the powerful Propaganda and Agitation Department since at least 2015. By 2020, Kim Yo-jong assumed an even more significant role at the Department of Organization and Guidelines, where she oversaw important daily decisions on personnel matters such as who would be monitored, demoted, promoted, punished, or banished. She was also authorized to run South Korea policy and U.S. policy. By 2021, Kim Yo-jong reportedly returned again to her prior position in the Propaganda and Agitation Department. She seems to be ambitious, in contrast to her older brother, Kim Jong-chul, who lacks interest in politics and was passed over long ago as a possible heir. Optics also indicate that Kim Yo-jong is powerful and trusted by Kim Jong-un. In the heavily choreographed events surrounding the leader, she is the only individual who moves freely, guiding others on where to stand and making spontaneous moves such as fetching an ashtray for her brother. These menial acts counterintuitively suggest a degree of power for Yo-jong that no one else has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transfer of power to Kim Yo-jong would mark the first horizontal transition of power, as well as the first female leader of North Korea. The past two successions have been vertical, passed from one generation to the next. While these would both be significant firsts, there are currently no other members of the family within this dynastic system who seem as capable or interested in leading as Kim Yo-jong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other figure who has received significant succession-related attention in recent months is Kim Jong-un’s daughter, Kim Ju-ae. She first appeared in public by Kim Jong-un’s side in November last year at the inspection and launch of a Hwasong-17 missile. Kim Jong-un reportedly has three children, one son and two daughters. Kim Ju-ae, the second child and first daughter, is estimated to be 10 years old. She was the child who Dennis Rodman famously held when he visited North Korea in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim Ju-ae’s now-frequent public appearances are highly unusual, given the Kim family traditions of extreme privacy. Basic information about the children of North Korean leaders had been guarded as a close secret in prior generations. The first photo of Kim Jong-un and his siblings was not released until April 2009, and Kim’s name was not announced until 2010, one year before he took power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unveiling of Kim Ju-ae at this particular time, and at her particular age, has generated a great deal of speculation about Kim Jong-un’s possible intentions. Some have said that Kim’s introduction of his daughter provides a means to humanize him or to make him appear fatherly and responsible as a custodian of the country’s nuclear weapons. Others have suggested that Kim Ju-ae’s debut serves as a signal, both internally and externally, that North Korea’s status as a nuclear state and the Kim family’s hold on power are secure and will be passed on to future generations. The parading of Kim Ju-ae could also be a useful distraction from further advances in North Korea’s weapons programs. A more extreme yet still plausible explanation is a power struggle between Ri Sol-Ju and Kim Yo-jung. As Kim Yo-jung’s political power within the regime began to grow, Ro Sol-ju may have wanted to keep her in check and make it clear that her children are in the succession line. All of these explanations, or some combination of them, seem plausible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Kim Ju-ae’s debut serves as a signal, both internally and externally, that North Korea’s status as a nuclear state and the Kim family’s hold on power are secure and will be passed on to future generations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that Kim Ju-ae’s recent public outings mark the early stages of a succession process, though there are reasons to be skeptical of this explanation, particularly given her young age. As one expert noted, “Ju-ae would need a phone book to . . . reach up and touch the nuclear button. She’s probably not first in line right now.” Furthermore, Ju-ae’s term of endearment, the “most beloved,” does not necessarily imply that she is considered the most qualified leader. If Ju-ae’s public debut was an aspect of grooming, there would likely be more deification of her, such as showcasing her abilities to lecture scientists on fissile material or get multiple holes in one on the golf course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it remains possible that Kim Ju-ae could be her father’s designated successor. The number of appearances with her father have proliferated since the beginning of 2023. Even though she has an older brother, who would be the most expected choice, given the vertical, male lineage of North Korean leaders that has prevailed thus far, his father might not deem that he is up for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the possibility that Ju-ae’s older brother is the actual successor. Under this scenario, the older brother is being protected from public scrutiny, perhaps attending a boarding school in Switzerland as his father did, while Ju-ae serves as a useful distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One panelist noted the possibility that the intelligence on Kim’s children has been faulty, and Ju-ae has no older brother — after all, he has never been seen in public, so there is no firm evidence that he exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two possible explanations for the patterns surrounding the women in Kim’s life. Kim could genuinely be a North Korean version of a “liberated man” seeking to empower women. But the opposite could also be true, that Kim’s elevation of a number of women reflects his insecurity. According to this line of reasoning, in a patriarchal society such as North Korea, women are less threatening to Kim than men. He can therefore use women to show that he has a support system around him and that there is a generation ahead of him. At the same time, his female cadre sends the message that he’s “still the man,” both literally and figuratively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the situation with Kim Jong-un’s health, there is no way to know for sure why Kim has chosen to raise the profile of his daughter at this time, or women within the regime more generally. Given these levels of uncertainty, all possibilities should be considered, even the ones that seem unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most conversations concerning North Korea in recent months have focused on its nuclear and missile programs. This is understandable, given the unprecedented 95 cruise and ballistic missile tests North Korea conducted in 2022, alongside preparations for a seventh nuclear test. The regime started 2023 with a battery of ballistic missile tests in February as well. But an examination of who is controlling the country’s nuclear weapons and missile systems is equally important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the current situation is deeply concerning, it is worth considering whether Kim Jong-un’s sudden demise would bring better unknowns. Is this something to hope for or something to fear? Perhaps the answer is both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two specific pieces of advice for policymakers grappling with how to manage leadership uncertainty in North Korea. On the one hand, it is important to focus on the current leader, the one “in front of the curtain now,” for “that’s the one we have to deal with.” At the same time, in considering the future of North Korea, it is important to keep a number of scenarios in mind, including the less likely “wild-card” ones. Balancing these two imperatives will help to ensure that policymakers are prepared to deal with whichever leadership scenarios the future may bring — from an extended period of Kim Jong-un’s rule to an abrupt succession and regime instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assumptions about leadership are baked into all policy decisions on North Korea. They should be made explicit and periodically revisited when considering various policy options. Exercises such as this CSIS workshop — mapping out a range of possibilities concerning three pivotal “known unknown” leadership variables — help to serve that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;區諾軒：不同意強迫他人否決財案做法 對無法維護多元聲音感內疚&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/u6412FS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（14日）踏入審訊第24天。區諾軒繼續接受盤問，同意「會積極」用權否決預算案的字眼由戴耀廷「發明」，但加入協調文件後新東及九西無進一步會議討論和達成共識，林卓廷及黃碧雲亦無簽署「墨落無悔」或「共同綱領」。區並認為民主派應維持多元性，故不同意當時部分人強迫他人同意否決預算案的做法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒同意他與戴耀廷是「35+計劃」的「主要推手」，他自己主要負責行政。法官李運騰問誰是「大腦」，區指「較少爭議嘅就係戴耀廷負責咗好大部分佢對於35+嘅理解」，即論述工作，又指戴在理論和主要發言人方面都是較主要位置。區主動補充，初選期間接觸較多相對保守的參選人，甚至社民連及民主黨等會託付於他，並突然表示：「我自己覺得好內疚，我係維護唔到多元嘅聲音。」官一度指不需深究該點（“You don’t need to go into that.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒新東第二次會議曾指不能勉強人否決財案&quot;&gt;區諾軒新東第二次會議曾指不能勉強人否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今繼續接受代表黃碧雲及林卓廷的大律師沈士文盤問。區早前供稱與戴耀廷辦初選「初心」不同，他的目標是協調民主派爭取立會過半，戴則着重運用否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區今確認，他在所有協調會議都沒有主動提出立會過半後否決預算案，並只在新東第二次會議提出質疑，表示「始終民主派有好多唔同人參選，唔同人有唔同諗法」，而功能界別參選人會顧及界別利益，「唔能夠勉強其他人否決財政預算案」，但不記得有誰回應。沈士文問上述是否他反對綑綁參選人否決預算案的例子，區表示：「我係有表達過唔同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈總結，故區諾軒在整個35+計劃的態度，是任何人都可以就否決預算案提出他們的看法，但不能強迫和綑綁其他候選人去否決？區指他的確不想綑綁其他人，但「公允地講句」，到了6月9日初選記者會，他的確無反對過戴耀廷對否決預算案的看法，此後也沒有反對，重申當時沒想到會犯法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區重申會積極運用字眼為戴耀廷發明-惟加入後新東九西無會議討論&quot;&gt;區重申「會積極運用」字眼為戴耀廷發明 惟加入後新東九西無會議討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，在6月8日，戴耀廷已將各區協調機制的「final」文件檔發予組織者，上有「會／會積極運用」權力否決預算案的條文，問區既然有不同看法，加入該條款是誰的主意？區重申是戴耀廷的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文再引述區諾軒錄影會面謄本，提及戴耀廷發表〈真攬炒十步〉後他即向戴提出質疑，並在新東第二次會議後，向戴及趙家賢反映兩個政黨的意見，指他們作為初選主事者，沒理由不理不同人看法而「表達一個咁激進立場」，戴則回應認為「積極運用《基本法》權力否決預算案」字眼是作為「大家討論嘅平衡點」，可予不否決的空間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒在法官詢問下確認該兩黨為民主黨和社民連，而「激進立場」是指戴耀廷在〈真攬炒十步〉提及一定要否決預算案致解散立法會和特首下台，並搖頭指：「當時候我哋開過咁多嘅協調會，佢（戴耀廷）冇理由唔知道唔同與會人士嘅意見。」區同意李運騰指，他與戴耀廷出現爭論（argument），但二人沒有直接在協調會議上交鋒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒重申，文件上否決預算案條款並非參與者的共識，這亦解釋了為何「會積極運用」字眼有一定程度彈性。他同意該字眼是戴耀廷的選擇和發明（choice and invention），戴在對否決預算案有爭議時使用該字作為「討論的平衡點」。但區承認，該字眼加入協調文件後，新界東和九龍西已無進一步會議及討論；並同意只知道戴有向其他人發送協調機制初稿，但「確實唔知道」他發送予誰人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱最遲於2020年3月24日-會積極一字已出現於協調文件&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱最遲於2020年3月24日 「會積極」一字已出現於協調文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問，由戴耀廷於6月8日發出各區協調文件的「final」檔，到各人報名參選、出席論壇、舉行投票，有沒有參選人提出要修改該份文件？區稱「我冇掌握到相關嘅資訊」，但同意新界西和九龍東候選人報名時夾附了共同綱領。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續就「會積極運用」字眼的源起發問，區表示在3月26日的初選記者會上，戴曾提及「我哋可以諗吓點樣運用基本法嘅權力」，但就他所知不同人有不同想法；當天晚上戴在首次港島協調會議提出相關議題，司馬文表示反對，戴遂開始以「會積極運用」的句子嘗試說服司馬文。區指據其憶述，「會積極」字眼在港島最早就是於當天提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於其他區，其中最早於3月2日舉行首次會議的九龍東，區指當時只就沒有否決預算案字眼的「35+計劃」文件討論，至3月尾的第二次會議，亦是爭拗替補機制等，無印象有討論否決權；是在不遲於5月4日的第三次會議，戴耀廷才「忽然話因為其他區佢都已經加咗（會積極運用權力否決預算案字眼），所以佢就想九龍東都加返」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於在3月24日舉行首次會議的九龍西，會上傳閱「35+計劃」文件，會後再傳閱有「會積極運用立法會權力」字眼的協調機制初稿。區在李運騰詢問下同意最遲於2020年3月24日，「會積極運用權力」用字已出現在初選的文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意林卓廷黃碧雲無簽共同綱領-與民主黨墨落無悔後不綑綁否決立場一致&quot;&gt;區同意林卓廷黃碧雲無簽共同綱領 與民主黨「墨落無悔」後不綑綁否決立場一致&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續指，戴耀廷於6月9日記者會表示參選人毋須簽署任何協議，是否因為參與者對否決預算案有分歧。區回應「就我理解，當時候係驚取消資格嘅問題」，沈追問意見分歧會否是其中一個原因，區再稱「佢應該冇咁諗」，指戴回答提問時曾指不會製作一份文件令政府取消參選者資格。區並同意，林卓廷和黃碧雲報名時沒有簽署或夾附任何共同綱領。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續問，二人行為是否與區諾軒對民主黨立場的理解一致？法官李運騰質疑問題假設民主黨對黨員有統一的政策，但事實上胡志偉本人報名時也夾附了共同綱領。沈遂改為提及，區諾軒早前供稱理解民主黨立場是望保留彈性，不綑綁否決預算案，至「墨落無悔」也沒有改變，區同意。沈遂問，據區理解黃碧雲和林卓廷沒有簽署及夾附共同綱領，是否與民主黨該立場一致？區確認，指二人報名時「都見唔到佢有轉變」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指墨落無悔及三投三不投非35一部分&quot;&gt;區諾軒指「墨落無悔」及「三投三不投」非「35+」一部分&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文其後續就「墨落無悔」聲明及「三投三不投」發問。區同意「墨落無悔」聲明是對戴耀廷記者會上稱參選人毋須簽聲明的回應，與35+計劃「毫無關係」。沈續問區作為組織者，是否不同意部分參選人試圖強迫其他人同意否決預算案？區指「民主派應該維持多元性，所以我唔同意當時嘅一啲做法」，他亦確認不止林卓廷和黃碧雲，「成個民主黨都冇簽（墨落無悔）𠻹。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「三投三不投」，沈士文提及吳政亨曾以「李伯盧」為筆名，於2020年7月3日在《蘋果日報》刊登關於「三投三不投」的廣告，區表示從報章得知，並在盤問下指除「墨落無悔」聲明「一定唔係大會嘅一部分」，「我都唔認為三投三不投係大會（35+計劃）嘅一部分嚟」，此時鄒家成與吳政亨交談，吳亦一直微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後指，區明顯沒有參與「三投三不投」，不能代表組織者之一的戴耀廷指戴與吳政亨沒有同意將該運動作為35+的分支計劃（sub-project），區答「我只能講我自己啦」，吳政亨發笑。沈士文一度問若「三投三不投」是「35+」的分支計劃，戴是否會告訴區，惟官稱問題太長，辯方無再繼續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指不知三投三不投財政及宣傳詳情惟認不包括在35財政&quot;&gt;區指不知「三投三不投」財政及宣傳詳情、惟認不包括在「35+」財政&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續指，「35+」的組織者／協調者是否包括區諾軒及戴耀廷，區同意，同時補充還有民主動力，並主要是他及戴耀廷透過趙家賢聯絡民主動力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問及，區有否留意到「三投三不投」與「35+」的財政、架構及管理層面上有任何聯繫，區表示戴耀廷只提及曾與李伯盧聯絡，至於當中財政及宣傳上的詳情「我一概不知」。李追問，「35+」的主要推手（primary mover）是否區及戴，區回答「可以咁講」；至於趙家賢及民主動力，則是他們找來協助辦初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問「35+」的財政由誰主管，區回應是民主動力，他們負責整理要申報的資料，最後攤分並向選舉事務處申報有關開支。陳仲衡續指，若「三投三不投」是「35+」一部分，那相關支出必然會納入「35+」財政，區回應雖然他並非負責財政，但以其理解，「三投三不投」是不包括在相關申報資料中。至於「35+」的籌募資金上，區表示由民主動力負責計數及宣傳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指戴耀廷負責咗好大部分對於35嘅理解在理論及主要發言人均有主要位置&quot;&gt;區指戴耀廷「負責咗好大部分對於35+嘅理解」、在理論及主要發言人均有主要位置&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問及區諾軒與戴耀廷如何分工，區指他主要負責出席協調會議，以及聯絡不同派系人士、就他們的需要作溝通，同時負責整個選舉論壇的舉辦。李問是否屬於行政方面，區指「可以係一個較主要嘅部分」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續問，誰是計劃的「大腦（brain）」，是區抑或戴？區表示：「我諗較少爭議嘅就係戴耀廷負責咗好大部分佢對於35+嘅理解」，解釋「我意思係論述嘅工作」；至於組織的工作，「佢當然有出席好多嘅協調會議，以及相關嘅活動啦，佢亦都係主要負責聯絡香港民研嘅人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李問，那「35+」的「理論思維（theoretical side）」方面由誰負責？區指從整個計劃期間的公開言論，戴耀廷的確負責較主要的位置。最後就「主要發言人（main speaker）」，區表示：「毋庸置疑，佢（戴耀廷）係一個較主要嘅位置嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱獲保守參選人託付-惟內疚維護唔到多元聲音&quot;&gt;區稱獲保守參選人託付 惟內疚「維護唔到多元聲音」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區接着主動補充，「大家可以見到隨住初選嘅情節發展啦，相對保守嘅參與者或者唔同嘅參選人，我係接觸得比較多嘅，甚至係佢哋個別亦都託付於我。」李運騰追問是否指黃浩銘？區解釋「包括社民連同埋民主黨」，並突然指：「我自己覺得好內疚，我係維護唔到多元嘅聲音。」李運騰一度指不需深究該點（“You don’t need to go into that.”），有被告發笑，在延伸庭的袁嘉蔚則露出「O嘴」的表情。沈士文續問區，他是否知道黃碧雲及林卓廷沒有支持「三投三不投」？區指自己沒有留意，亦非適合的角色去談及此事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

Any future operational plans assuming that a war will be short-lived may run against a capable and determined adversary willing to wage a prolonged conflict.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;That is what has happened in Ukraine, where Russia’s plan for a quick decapitation strike and absorption of further territory was thwarted by the fierce resistance of the Ukrainian people with the support of allies and partners, led by the United States. It is now a war of attrition. The protracted nature of the war has prompted questions and reflection on the readiness of the U.S. defense industrial base, though the current conflict is not yet an exercise in industrial mobilization. To date, the robust support that the United States has provided to Ukraine has primarily come out of stockpiles, drawing the United States down to levels that have triggered concerns as to whether there are sufficient residual inventories for training and to execute war plans in the case of a conflict in which the United States is directly involved. It is no longer a question of whether the U.S. industrial base is prepared to rapidly surge production in the case of a direct conflict with a capable adversary — it is clear that it is not, and that is because the necessary investments have not yet been made to make it so.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In World War II, the United States served as the “Arsenal of Democracy” — a term President Franklin D. Roosevelt used to refer to the key industrial role U.S. industry played in the Allied war effort — but it took more than five years for the industrial base to fully gear up for the war effort.[1] If the United States were to be directly engaged in conflict, the time it could take to surge production represents a serious vulnerability. Why is surging production so complicated, and why would it take so long?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before this conflict, concerns about the shallow depth of U.S. precision weapon inventories, the preferred weapons of defense planning scenarios, loomed in the Pentagon and Congress. This vulnerability is just now being elevated by policymakers. Language in the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) authorizes an increase in the acquisition of new munitions, for example, including with multiyear buying authorities. Reaching the programmed number may take years to finish at current production rates , so discussions are increasingly about the need to surge production levels as a solution, and the U.S. Army is taking steps to support this. However, years of underinvestment mean that the industrial base may not be sufficient to both refill and increase stocks while meeting demands from allies in the timeframe that can have a warfighting impact at the speed of relevance. Furthermore, the commercial defense industrial base itself faces an incentive structure that motivates a least-cost production model at the expense of capacity and delivery speed, which means that manufacturing slack has been eliminated to the extent possible. While this incentive structure is designed to ensure that the Department of Defense (DOD) can invest in as broad a range of capabilities as possible and to carefully allocate taxpayer funds, it has reduced the ability of the defense industrial base to surge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a formal requirement with clear targets for higher sustained volumes — and with issued contracts — defense contractors have not risked investing in the production capacity that is now needed. This issue is pervasive across the defense manufacturing ecosystem, not just for munitions. Refilling inventories in a reasonable timeframe or preparing for surge more generally may require contractors to invest in additional capacity to allow for production to increase. It is thus worthwhile to review the steps required to boost production rates so that policymakers have an understanding of what it takes to surge and, more specifically, what types of investments are required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question that must be addressed when considering surge production for any capability is whether existing factories and facilities have the necessary capacity to expand in-house production. Generally, an increase in production using existing facilities and workforce would be the most cost-effective approach, so assessing capacity is a key first step. The fixed costs of production (e.g., facilities and machine tools) may be useable for up to three shifts. If the factory is not at full capacity and has space for additional production requirements, more workers can be hired or additional shifts can be added. Recruiting and retaining workers is more challenging when unemployment rates are low and workforce participation rates are already high. In early February 2023, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is 3.4 percent. One major defense contractor reported offering $10,000 bonuses to existing workers for identifying new skilled mechanics who join the organization, and paying long-distance relocation costs for the new skilled touch labor employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the factory is running three shifts at full capacity, there is the potential to increase production by using industrial engineers to look for new ways of doing the work, to speed up assembly, or to otherwise find efficiencies. The search for production efficiencies is not a new one, so one challenge is that the increasing automation and adoption of production approaches such as lean manufacturing may have already taken all significant slack and unnecessary expenses out of the system, an approach driven both by advances in industrial engineering and by government contract incentive structures that focus on reducing costs. There may still be room for improvement, particularly if the factory is able to use robots where increased automation is possible. Changing production approaches might require additional training for the workforce, along with coordinating with a union if there is a represented workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing capacity within an existing facility will require an increase in other inputs besides labor. Deliveries of raw materials, parts, subassemblies, and whatever components go into the goods being produced will need to increase to support the new production rate. Increasing production at final assembly sites requires an increase in the full range of inputs. If supply chains are constrained, increasing production may be difficult or even impossible. For some subcontractors, their defense production may represent a small portion of their total output, and increasing the percentage of their output sent to defense contractors may not make economic sense if it harms their relations with other, more profitable customers. Aerospace is the largest market for titanium, but the metal has multiple consumer uses, including in automobiles — and there is a single U.S. producer of titanium sponge and titanium castings. Castings and forgings have been identified as a risk item by all services of the U.S. military. Semiconductors are used across the entire spectrum of manufacturing and have lead times of up to six months. Requirements for U.S.-sourced subcomponents, down to the material level, complicate production growth; contractors cannot just turn to the open market to look for new suppliers without a rigorous qualification process. Government regulations for defense contracting require U.S.-sourced subcomponents, generally down to the material level. Some munitions materials have such adverse environmental impact that they are not available in the United States, causing dependence on foreign sources and critical points of failure. Thus, investments in increasing the supply of manufacturing inputs are fundamental to a successful manufacturing surge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of munitions production, the DOD retains some manufacturing capacity in-house, such as artillery shells and chemicals that go into making explosives and propellants. In these government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) facilities, the commercial entity that manages the GOCO may have limits on investments in facilities and tooling that may not exist in contractor-owned and contractor-operated (COCOs) sites. The operating contracts for GOCO plants have a relatively short durations (5 to 10 years), which limits companies’ assurance that they can recoup and profit from investments, if they are allowed to make them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If additional factory space necessitating capital expenditures is required, there may be a corporate review process for approval before decisions are made. If the plan is approved, the new facility may either be built at the same site or at a different location. Building the facilities at the same site offers certain economies of scale, especially in terms of management. For example, plant management can take responsibility for the additional production space, the same human resources staff can oversee the process of recruiting, hiring, and training new employees, and new workers can get trained by existing production employees. Likewise, the quality assurance staff can oversee the quality processes for the new production lines. While additional personnel may be required in each of these functions to support the capacity increase, the institutions themselves are in place. For the facility itself, issues with the local community or federal regulatory agencies regarding permits, environmental impact assessments, and other technical challenges may have already been addressed. The local community may have longer-term relationships with, and thus greater trust, in plant management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are also downsides to collocating additional production space. If factories have already expanded their radius of recruitment because of the low local unemployment, additional workers may be difficult to find. Building in a new location also has the benefit of reducing the risk of having a single point of failure. For example, climate-related emergencies such as tornadoes and hurricanes have the potential to wreak significant damage, although factories may be hardened against all but the most unusual events. Human-caused disruptions such as terrorism or adversary attacks represent other risks. In one historical example of hardening against such disruptions in the 1950s, a second production for the California-built F-86 Sabre was developed in Columbus, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the decision is made to build in a “greenfield” site, the first step is to identify the location. Some states and localities may offer subsidies to attract new business, such as direct investments, tax rebates, and investments in roads. Some may have labor laws that are more advantageous to employers. It takes time for a company to collect and analyze this information. Some types of production also have very specific constraints, which may shape location decisions. Shipbuilding needs to occur on the coast, and appropriate land can be very scarce and subject to additional environmental constraints relating to littoral environments. The construction of nuclear-powered ships and submarines brings additional complications, which will contribute to the difficulty of any increase in submarine production to support AUKUS. Another example of such an issue is choosing the site location for factories working with energetic explosive material, as these will need to be located at a distance from population centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new facility will also need to be designed, and there might be a time lag if a competition for the architect is held. Plants should be designed with industrial engineering considerations in mind, so space limitations should not constrain the manufacturing approach. Plans can be started in advance of the location decision, but there may need to be some changes based on the specific site. A variety of building permits will need to be obtained before building can commence, and there may be additional necessary permits depending on the production processes, such as those involving paint with volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Getting permits can be time-consuming and require support from counsel to work through the procedure and deal with any rejections. After the building is constructed, additional inspections by government regulators will likely be required before work can start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before building commences, a competition may be held for different construction companies to ensure best value and lowest costs. Once a contractor is chosen, some work may start immediately, but there may be items necessary for building construction with long lead times due to supply chain challenges. Building a facility to support construction may have specific requirements that take additional time and expertise, such as extremely level floors or advanced air filtration, along with the usual requirements, including electricity, plumbing, internet connectivity, landscaping, and fire alarms. New roads, a rail link, a runway, or other local transportation infrastructure may be necessary to facilitate the delivery of inputs into the plant and finished items to the customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As complicated as the above process is, the time to develop and build additional infrastructure may not be the biggest schedule constraint. For complex production processes, advanced machine tools can take years between order and delivery and may need to be sourced from overseas. This includes machines such as multi-axis metal cutting machines, lasers, and autoclaves. Particularly large machines and hard tooling can require additional support in the building foundation as well as overhead cranes to move heavy parts. Production planning and ordering machine tools does not need to wait until the building is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new site will require new plant management and whatever other on-site support functions are needed to run the factory. Manufacturing touch labor in defense production may require extensive training and specific certifications on skills such as welding, where it can take years to move from apprentice to mastery. In addition to the time necessary to recruit and hire new workers, on a greenfield location where most or all workers are new, it will take time to bring them up to speed and train them to work together as a team. Along with touch labor, other production elements such as industrial engineering, test, and quality control may need to be identified and staffed. Some individuals may be willing to move from other sites either temporarily or permanently to help start up the new location. The U.S. government will also need to staff on-site regulatory functions such as the Defense Contract Management Agency and Defense Contract Audit Agency. This is not something that the defense contractors themselves can control or accelerate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same supply chain challenges associated with increasing production capacity within an existing plant also pertain to a new facility. Suppliers will also need to surge, and in turn, their subcontractors will need to surge. Even if the necessary excess manufacturing capacity is present, components or key materials may have limited sources and those sources may be shared by multiple product lines that might be surging at once. This is not something that prime contractors can control, although long-term relationships with suppliers, including training on best practices to develop flexible responses for changing demand, can help. That will not address the question of deconflicting requirements if multiple systems rely on the same subcontractor, especially where there is a single U.S. source. Which system takes priority will be a question that needs to be resolved. Furthermore, there are difficulties in bringing new suppliers into the defense industrial base ecosystem, including concerns about losing intellectual property rights and challenges due to the stringent government regulatory environment, such as cybersecurity requirements laid out in the cybersecurity maturity model certification guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the supply chain, one strategy could include certain kinds of stockpiling of supplies — for example, maintaining inventories of materials like steel, that could be used in times of surge. This approach should focus on inputs that do not face the risk of obsolescence. In spite of long lead times for items like semiconductors, stockpiling is not a solution for those because of the rapid technology refresh in that sector, and stockpiles will risk being outdated and useless. For those, the government might encourage creating incentives for industry to develop preferred customer status with suppliers so that they can trigger priority access in the event of need. It should be noted that stockpiling or maintaining inventories of final products also comes with costs in both potential obsolescence as well as warehousing costs and regular maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building capacity for any type of defense manufacturing — not just munitions — is complicated by the lack of a clear market signal. For consumer goods, companies can make predictions about the long-term viability of a product and estimate the return on investment of building additional capacity before making decisions. Defense production is different. The DOD is generally the only U.S. buyer for defense goods, and government policies often reduce or eliminate the contractor’s ability to sell in the commercial market — that is, to foreign militaries. If a contractor invests its capital to increase capacity, and a surge in DOD requirements never materializes or results in signed contracts, the contractors would not be able to recoup their investments in that now excess capacity, and an increase in cost structure may impact their ability to successfully compete for future contracts. Multiyear contracts can provide additional fidelity to future demand, but the DOD needs congressional approval before issuing multiyear contracts, and Congress imposes limits on their use, although the 2023 NDAA authorized them for certain munitions purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the hardest questions when planning for surge are who is going to pay for it, and how. The question of funding any necessary increases in capacity will need to be answered before capacity can be increased. A long-term commitment on the part of Congress and the services will be necessary for defense contractors to make these investments. In addition, the government will need to ensure that future contracts support the maintenance of excess capacity — of slack — rather than continually drive to low-cost solutions. The clear challenge here, as ever, is competing priorities. Investing in increasing the surge capacity for existing systems may reduce the government’s budget for modernization investments that will produce capabilities needed in the future fight. Finally, since most of the companies in the defense industrial base also produce for the commercial industrial base, they may not want to tie up capital by maintaining slack capacity if the incentives are insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that a strategy of working with allies can alleviate some of the strain on the domestic defense industry. “Ally-shoring” or “friend-shoring” — one approach that has been identified to take advantage of any existing capacity in the industrial bases of close allies — may be able to accelerate the potential for surge. Of course, this relies on whether there is slack capacity overseas, which would need to be assessed. Depending on how production is allocated, this can free up U.S. facilities for more advanced weaponry where export controls and intellectual property concerns could push production to stay in the United States while allocating existing capabilities to overseas suppliers. The key negotiating points to address will be deciding what is produced where, which country or which companies pay for necessary amendments to infrastructure, and how technology transfer considerations are handled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next war that the United States faces may not be one where it enjoys a distinct capability advantage, as in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Allied Freedom. For a long war against a more capable adversary, the United States may need to more directly draw on its industrial base, with production going directly from the factory to the front. After a year of supporting Ukraine primarily out of existing stockpiles, there are signs that political leadership recognizes the need to awaken the “Arsenal of Democracy” in continued support of Ukraine and to refill the “empty bins.” Engaging the United States’ larger manufacturing sector for a longer-term production increase will be a more significant effort. Developing an implementation approach to do so — an operational or “OPlan” for mobilization — is something that planners should work on now. The challenges of supporting Ukraine should show us that we are certainly not thinking about this too early, and hopefully not too late. If there is a future conflict, the nation will have to go to war with the industrial base that it has at the time. The World War II model of engaging the industrial base in five years may not be sufficient for a conflict with a highly capable adversary with a strong industrial base, a strategy of onshoring all the components of production, and near-monopoly power over critical subcomponents, including critical materials used in defense production across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China seeks to fully control Taiwan through three distinct but interrelated campaigns: persuasion, coercion, and compellence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;American policy’s focus on compellence marginalizes strategies that counter China’s persuasion and coercion campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China is more likely to achieve its goals through persuasion and coercion or a form of compellence, such as a blockade of the island, short of an amphibious invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US must urgently rethink its defense of Taiwan so that it blocks all three roads to Chinese victory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US policy to defend Taiwan from Chinese aggression is overly focused on the risk that China will attempt an amphibious invasion of Taiwan. The US is not paying sufficient heed to Chinese efforts to regain control of Taiwan through persuasion and coercion, and US strategies to block a Chinese invasion may actually undermine efforts to block the persuasion and coercion roads to Chinese success. Xi Jinping likely prefers to accomplish his aims by means short of war. Those roads offer Xi the prospect of success at much lower risk and cost than fighting a war. The US must develop strategies to defeat these campaigns while deterring an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing faces a difficult set of choices between military considerations and geopolitical dilemmas that US discussions of a putative Chinese invasion often fail to consider adequately. A militarily optimal Chinese invasion strategy would require that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) strike American bases in Japan, a US treaty ally, and Guam, US territory, early in a conflict. Such attacks would bring the US fully into the war and expand the conflict to include Japan and other East Asian states. American strategists may worry that the US would not commit fully even after Guam was attacked or that the Japanese would try to remain neutral, but neither scenario is likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi has no reason to be confident in outcomes that would be optimal for China. Such attacks, after all, would be even more radical moves than Vladimir Putin’s have been in Europe. American strategists cannot take for granted that the US and its allies will behave optimally, but Xi cannot dismiss the possibility that they would. He will thus face an unpleasant choice once he decides to invade — accept the risk of expanding the war greatly or leave fully operational the bases from which a possibly devastating US military response might come. These considerations, among others, make strategies of persuasion, coercion, and military isolation short of invasion far more attractive to Xi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s persuasion and coercion campaigns target the will of Taiwan, the United States, and America’s allies to support and defend the island. Ongoing Chinese demonstrations of military capability accompanied by “lawfare” — the weaponization of legal arguments for political purposes — and information operations aim to convince the American people, US allies, and the Taiwanese people that the Taiwan issue is a domestic Chinese matter that other countries should leave to Beijing to “resolve.” They also try to demonstrate that Taiwan is not defensible and that any use of force to resist Chinese aggression would result in a catastrophe for Taiwan and any intervening force. China’s persuasion campaign works to rewrite history and convince other nations of things that are not true in order to erode resistance to its aggression against Taiwan. China’s coercion campaign is a form of “violent bargaining” meant to use means short of large-scale war to force other nations to comply with its demands and defer to its interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also aims by persuasion and coercion to set the conditions for a campaign of compellence: the use of force through blockade or invasion. That is why it is vital Washington not allow Beijing to isolate Taipei, push America into a standoff defensive posture that pulls the bulk of its military forces outside the Chinese anti-access and area-denial (A2/AD) zones within which US forces are most at risk, and undermine US efforts to build a coalition. A blockade accompanied by other means of isolating Taiwan is an attractive option for China. Beijing could force ships en route to Taiwan to stop for inspections, disrupting the supply of resources to the island. The Chinese Communist Party could then attempt to use the PLA to convince the American people and US allies that a US response to break the blockade would be escalatory. Chinese persuasion and coercion campaigns are meant to induce precisely such responses should Beijing escalate to the overt use of force on a limited basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US must urgently reorient its approach to defending Taiwan against all three of China’s roads to controlling the island. Deterring and ability to defeat an invasion are necessary but insufficient conditions for success in maintaining the status quo: a de facto independent Taiwan. US approaches to those challenges must reinforce rather than undermine US and coalition efforts to defeat China’s persuasion and coercion campaigns. US strategy for defending Taiwan must defeat each of China’s interrelated campaigns separately and all of them together. Policymakers must explain and defeat Chinese information operations aimed at the American and global publics so that they understand and can resist China’s persuasion campaign. The US must demonstrate its commitment to the defense of Taiwan to its own public, Taiwan and potential coalition partners, and Xi himself. America must defend the rules-based international order specifically as it applies to Taiwan against the incremental escalations of Beijing’s coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been moving along three roads to fully integrating Taiwan into the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and extinguishing Taiwan’s autonomy: persuasion, coercion, and compellence. American policy has focused increasingly on preventing China from seizing Taiwan by force — blocking the compellence road. But China can still secure its goals through persuasion and coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Xi Jinping likely prefers those roads to the much riskier path of overt military attack on the island. Blocking the Chinese roads through persuasion and coercion is not a marginal task, nor is it inherent in the effort to deter or defeat a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. The current US approach to blocking the compellence road may in fact increase the likelihood that Xi will reach his objectives by these other two paths. The US must urgently rethink its approach to the problem of defending Taiwan’s autonomy so that it blocks all three roads to PRC victory rather than focusing on only one — at the expense or even to the detriment of defending Taiwan against ongoing persuasion and coercion campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;persuasion&quot;&gt;Persuasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can easily overstate the Chinese preference for “winning without fighting” or ascribe to Chinese military thought an intellectual patent on an idea that other societies and cultures value and share. Frequent and facile references to Sun Tzu’s aphorism that “those who render others’ armies helpless without fighting are the best of all” contribute to this danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that repetition of this aphorism has made it seem trite, however, does not strip it of its force in Chinese thought. The concept of buzhan ersheng (不战而胜) — to “subdue the enemy without fighting” — has been a cornerstone of Chinese strategic thinking for centuries. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has pursued a massive military reform and modernization program since 1993 in preparation for modern, great-power warfare, even as Beijing has intensified a coercion campaign that uses real and threatened power to achieve its aims. But China has not abandoned the psychological strategies that helped the CCP successfully topple the Republic of China (ROC) during the Chinese civil war and take over mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of so shaping an adversary’s understanding of the world that it voluntarily chooses one’s own preferred course of action is a highly evolved part of Chinese strategic thought and practice. The idea of causing the enemy to perceive its own benefit in choosing the path most favorable to oneself is heavily discussed in Sun Tzu, encapsulated in the observation that “what causes opponents to come of their own accord is the prospect of gain.” Mao Zedong translated that aphorism into an accessible analogy, describing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;three ways to make a cat eat a hot pepper: stuff it down the cat’s throat, disguise the pepper by wrapping it in cheese, or grind the pepper up and spread it on the cat’s back. In the latter case, the cat will lick itself, thinking it is doing something for itself when it is actually doing what you want. This is the essence of strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soviet theorists expanded on this idea in considerable and meticulous detail under the rubric of “reflexive control.” Soviet writer Vladimir Lefebvre described reflexive control in the following manner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In making his decision the adversary uses information about the area of conflict, about his own troops and ours, about their ability to fight, etc. We can influence his channels of information and send messages, which shift the flow of information in a way favorable for us. The adversary uses the most contemporary method of optimization and finds the optimal decision. However, it will not be a true optimum, but a decision predetermined by us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflexive control is at the heart of Russian information operations and hybrid war theories. The CCP has long studied and learned from Russian thought and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mao’s theory of how to prevail in war was based on what he called the “three magic weapons.” The CCP, or politics, is in the lead. It wields armed force together with “the united front” to “storm and shatter the enemy’s positions.” Armed force is calibrated to support the ongoing work of political struggle to defeat an enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA has always had robust political warfare units alongside its conventional units. Its General Political Department (GPD) was devoted to undermining enemy morale and building international support. The GPD helped build the United Front with the Kuomintang (KMT) against the Japanese while subverting the KMT military to further its aims in the Chinese civil war. The GPD was reorganized in 2015 into the Central Military Commission’s Political Work Department. Its responsibilities are to conduct the “three warfares”: public opinion warfare, legal warfare, and psychological warfare. This department, along with the new Strategic Support Force, where the PLA’s cyber, space, electronic warfare, and information warfare units reside, is responsible for conducting political warfare in peace and war, including the ongoing coercive campaign against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s theory of victory rests on the destruction of Taiwan’s morale: If Taiwan believes that the US will not or cannot help undermine China’s escalating threats, it will have to accede to Beijing’s demands. Taiwan is a small, isolated island with little acceptance as an independent state. It is sui generis in international relations. Absent US support, it is not difficult to imagine morale on the island collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s persuasion campaign is thus aimed at not only Taiwan but also the US and its key allies and partners. Beijing continues to use all the tools at its disposal to drive general acceptance of the reality it desires to instantiate — that Taiwan is part of China, not an independent country, and that all other states agree with that premise. Its goal in doing so is to achieve preemptive recognition of its objectives and thereby collapse Taipei’s will to resist by demonstrating that Taiwan is fully isolated and alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This objective is the primary motivation behind the CCP’s constant efforts to rewrite history and current events in what often appears to be a ham-fisted way. The CCP has thus continually portrayed itself as the victim and the US and Taiwan as the aggressors in the cross-Strait dispute, despite enormous concessions and diplomatic generosity by Washington and Taipei. This argument resonates in parts of the nonaligned world and among potential US partners who would rather stay neutral in a conflict over Taiwan and more broadly in the US-China global competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as the CCP engages in highly destabilizing shows of force, it accuses the US and Taiwan of violating an “agreement” that was never made, in which the US supposedly recognized Beijing’s right to control Taiwan’s affairs. A brief excursion into the actual history of PRC-ROC relations — and America’s relations with both — is necessary to understand the scope and scale of Beijing’s revisionism as part of its persuasion campaign to isolate Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ROC, not the PRC, was China’s sovereign government after the fall of the Qing dynasty. Though the ROC never controlled all the lands it claimed, it had all the trappings and juridical elements of a state for most of the period in which it ruled mainland China. The ROC conducted all official diplomatic business for China before the CCP’s victory in 1949. The ROC was part of the grand alliance in World War II and a charter member of the United Nations Security Council. Consistent with the prominent role it was to have after the war, the ROC, not the CCP, accepted the surrender of the Japanese on Taiwan. The CCP only came to power after its violent rebellion against the duly constituted ROC government run by the KMT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP prevailed on the mainland, but the ROC survived and retreated to Taiwan. The CCP governed, had sovereignty, and was the legitimate ruler only over the mainland of China, while the KMT had sovereignty and legitimate rule over the island of Taiwan and the offshore Matsu, Pescadores, and Quemoy islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP consistently denies and attempts to persuade others to deny the historical and geopolitical reality that there have been two Chinas since 1949: an ROC on Taiwan and a PRC on the mainland. The US recognized the ROC (including its claims to rule all of China) from 1949 to 1979 and the PRC (which also claims to rule all of China) from 1979 onward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift in US recognition did not change the reality of the two Chinas. The US made a policy choice to accommodate the PRC, a decision that had no bearing on the continued reality that the ROC legitimately governed Taiwan. Though the US made an enormous concession to its erstwhile enemy by switching its official recognition from the ROC to the PRC and abrogating its treaty with the island, the ROC still ruled Taiwan and had sovereignty over its people. The shift in US recognition was not accompanied by a formal agreement that the CCP was the legitimate ruler of Taiwan and that the ROC was therefore illegitimate. Beijing demanded such an agreement, but it only received an “acknowledgement” from Washington of the CCP’s position that Taiwan was a sovereign part of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when the US broke formal ties with Taipei — but still refused to recognize the CCP’s formal claims — the US Congress protested and enacted with bipartisan support the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), which provides the legal basis for strong if unofficial relations with Taiwan today. The US thus never officially recognized China’s claim of sovereignty over Taiwan. Washington’s robust political, commercial, cultural, and educational ties with Taiwan are required by law. The PRC knows this yet insists that the US can somehow stop supporting Taiwan. Further, the US has a legal requirement to help Taiwan resist coercion. The TRA was passed in 1979, yet China continued with the process of diplomatic normalization. It thus implicitly acknowledged that US unofficial relations with Taiwan are part of what Washington calls “our one China policy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP not only denies this reality but also portrays itself as an aggrieved party, despite the concessions the US has made to its demands. The US shifted its recognition from the ROC to the PRC at a time when China was especially weak: ravaged by Mao’s Cultural Revolution, threatened by the Soviets with nuclear war, and readying for war with a Vietnam that was becoming hegemonic and hostile. It has still not acknowledged this tremendous US concession, but rather continues trying to force more change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand Beijing’s persuasion campaign, it is useful to understand what the US did not agree to in its “One China” policy and what Congress insisted on through the TRA and associated actions. First, the US does not take a position on Taiwan’s sovereignty. It insists that the dispute over sovereignty between Taipei and Beijing is to be worked out peacefully, without preconditions. That is why the TRA’s language requiring the US to resist Chinese coercion of Taiwan is so crucial: Washington has always maintained that Taiwan should not have to negotiate with a gun pointed at its head. That the US does not take a position on sovereignty does not negate Taiwan’s sovereignty; under international law, Taiwan is a sovereign entity. The US is making a reversible policy concession to the PRC in not officially recognizing the ROC, and it certainly never agreed to the “One China” principle (as opposed to America’s “One China” policy), which Beijing tries to persuade countries to accept. The supposed “principle” is that Taiwan has always been part of the PRC. The principle is a lie — Taiwan has never been part of the People’s Republic of China. It has been part of past Chinese empires (as well as Dutch, Portuguese, and Japanese empires), but it has never been part of the political entity that is the PRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the US never agreed to cut off unofficial ties with Taiwan or limit the seniority of officials who conduct the operations of this unofficial relationship. Indeed, the presidents of Taiwan and the US can meet if they so choose. Such meetings cannot have the trappings of official state meetings because treating the Taiwanese leader as the president of Taiwan would violate America’s definition of its “One China” policy — not because it would violate international law or any promise to Beijing. Yet the PRC protests meetings between lower levels of the US government and Taiwanese officials, increasingly through demonstrations of force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, while the US stated in a 1982 diplomatic communiqué that it would cap arms sales to Taiwan, it made abundantly clear that this cap was contingent on China’s commitment to peace as manifested in China’s military posture. But China’s military posture has grown more menacing. Given Washington’s historic position that it will calibrate its Taiwan policy based on the threat China poses to Taiwan, the US has no formal obligation to limit its military relationship with Taiwan. It has limited this relationship as a concession to China. But it can exercise with and train the ROC armed forces, and it can sell any military equipment it deems necessary to keep the peace across the strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the US never agreed to limit Taiwan’s international political and economic identity. Washington can push for Taiwan’s participation in any international organization for which statehood is not a requirement. China has in the past acquiesced to Taiwan’s participation as a separate legal entity in the World Trade Organization. China, not the US, has changed policy. Beijing is trying to persuade the US and its allies that the “One China” principle governs cross-Strait relations, that Taiwan is part of the PRC, and that the US is abrogating promises to China to this effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US must undermine this persuasion campaign and provide its allies with the political cover to develop the kind of relations with Taiwan that they want, free from Chinese intimidation. There is simply nothing provocative about this policy. The US promised not to unilaterally confer diplomatic recognition on the ROC, and it is abiding by that promise. On the other hand, the PRC is not abiding by its promise of peacefully resolving its differences with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;coercion&quot;&gt;Coercion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP has not been content to rely on persuasion to secure final control of Taiwan, of course. It has long accompanied its persuasion campaign with an expanding coercion effort. This effort fits with Thomas Schelling’s definition of coercion as a kind of “violent communications about intentions and commitment.” Schelling’s insight was that the power to hurt gives states tremendous bargaining power. Expounding on his work, scholar Tami Davis Biddle evokes one of the most memorable scenes in modern cinematic history to explain how coercion works: In The Godfather, Don Corleone tells his consigliere that he will make a noncompliant movie producer an “offer he cannot refuse” to get him to do something he otherwise would not do. Following a famous scene involving a decapitated horse’s head, the producer subsequently hired the don’s friend for an important role in an upcoming movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie producer felt he had to comply or face more harm. This cinematic example helps illustrate the PRC’s coercion tactics toward the US and Taiwan. No serious analyst doubts that Beijing is willing and able to inflict harm against Taiwan and the US if they do not comply with its demands. The act of being coerced is thus a psychological process. The coercer must manipulate the mind of the coerced. As Schelling says, the power to hurt is a bargaining power. The willingness to use it is diplomacy — “vicious diplomacy, but diplomacy.” This strategy is an exploitation of fear. Arguably, a state’s leverage over another is at its greatest when its adversary believes it has not yet used all its power, that any display of force is a restrained one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The PLA’s Theory of Coercion.&lt;/strong&gt; The PLA has been interested in US theories of coercion since the first Gulf War. Coercive strategies fit well with a CCP strategic culture that emphasizes the ability to manipulate an adversary’s psyche through stratagems. According to Mark Stokes, in the late 1990s the PLA began to theorize that US aerospace coercion was related to China’s own concepts of stratagem, which it calls moulüe (谋略). Military force could be used to attack “an opponent’s cognitive processes.” Military strategies of this kind require specific calculations of where pressure or manipulation can be applied to achieve political objectives. The PLA theorizing about coercive tactics closely resembled Mao’s writing about the so-called magic weapons of warfare. Force and political manipulation were tightly sewn into strategies that manipulate the enemy and make them concede before all-out warfare is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLA theorists wrote about the coercion of Taiwan in the context of achieving limited political objectives, short of what could be achieved through an invasion and occupation of the island. Force would be modulated based on the objective and level of resistance to it. Deterring de jure independence requires a certain level of force; forcing agreement with different forms of unification requires more force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These PLA writings coincided with the onset of the PLA modernization program in 1993. By the beginning of the 21st century, the PLA was deploying a lethal, precision-guided missile force positioned across the Taiwan Strait, enabled by a modernizing comprehensive command, control, communications, and computers and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (known as C4ISR) program. Indeed, the PLA aerospace force was the leading edge of the modernization program. At the same time, the PLA was developing anti-access and area-denial (A2AD) capabilities that raised the costs of US intervention on Taiwan’s behalf. The political message to Taiwan was clear: The PLA could inflict great harm on the island, and the US would not want to risk making a costly defense of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the PLA acquired new capabilities, it developed new options to deter Taipei’s moves to formalize its de facto independent status, co-opt Washington to contain such perceived moves by Taiwan, and set conditions for intensification of the use of force across the strait. PLA authors stressed that the threat or actual application of force is necessary to ensure its goals regarding Taiwan, and Washington understood the consequences of crossing Beijing’s ever-changing political thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA continues to debate the efficacy of demonstrations of power to affect political dynamics. The 2020 version of the Science of Military Strategy describes weishe (威慑), often translated as “deterrence,” as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a method of military conflict to achieve a political goal based on military strength . . . and determination to use strength [that] makes the other side face unworthy or even unbearable consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intended political outcome of this method of military conflict is to make the adversary “give in, compromise, or surrender,” ideally without having to engage in large-scale fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA may use military conflict at a low level to achieve a political goal. The Science of Military Strategy identifies “warning military strikes” as part of strategies to both forestall adversary actions and coerce compliance. Indeed, limited uses of military strikes against precise and specific targets can showcase the ability and determination to achieve military and political objectives and may obviate the need for larger military campaigns and operations. The PLA does not see itself as moving through distinct phases of war, from “shaping” and “influence” operations to “kinetic” use of force operations. Rather, it intertwines shaping and influence operations with kinetic operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All militaries are instruments of politics, but in the PRC the relationship has historically been more direct. The PLA is the party’s armed wing, not China’s professional military. The PLA’s foundational purpose is to help the party win political struggles and develop new political realities. In turn, the CCP’s main purpose is to expand its power over territory and peoples. The party’s history as an insurgency engaged in “people’s war” informs its current conduct as it expands its writ over Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan’s case, the CCP seeks to expand its political power over new territory and 24 million additional people that is has never ruled. This is difficult to do and would require much more force than any of the other populations and territories it now controls. The PLA is thus a crucial tool, and intensifying applications of actual — rather than “only” demonstrations of — force may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coercive campaign offers the PRC distinct advantages over a campaign to invade and occupy Taiwan. It also provides Beijing flexibility to continually redefine what it considers the bounds of acceptable political behavior by Taipei and Washington. First, unlike a campaign of brute force annihilation, Beijing can redefine success if it needs to. Second, Beijing’s negotiating leverage keeps increasing as the PLA grows stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The coercive campaign offers the PRC distinct advantages over a campaign to invade and occupy Taiwan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP’s coercion campaign has expanded even as Taipei has made concessions. The ROC abandoned its claim to be the sole legitimate ruler of all of China in 1991. In effect, Taiwan declared peace, abandoning its stated policy of unification through force, and aligned its polity with geopolitical realities. The overwhelming majority of Taiwanese residents did not come to Taiwan during the KMT retreat, and they had no say and little interest in perpetuating the Chinese civil war. They disagree with Washington’s “One China” policy and never had a say in its foundational 1972 statement that “all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but One China.” Yet they have accepted it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A substantial group of voters now supports Taiwan’s newer Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), an erstwhile opposition party that rose to power as part of the independence movement in Taiwan. But the once-oppressed DPP voters made an enormous concession by accepting that they were citizens of the ROC, not of a new state called Taiwan. The ROC is a preexisting political entity whose existence the CCP recognizes in practice even while denying its right to rule over anything. Any declaration of the existence of a new Republic of Taiwan would seem to Beijing a declaration of independence and therefore an escalation rather than a concession. But the US does not support such a political escalation and thus this option is all but impossible. Rather, the US supports the political status quo, which means that the ROC rules Taiwan and the PRC rules mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taipei also suspended martial law in 1987, which had been put in place to fight Communist subversion and infiltration. It made political changes to better reflect the reality that its government only has sovereignty over the people and territory of Taiwan, though it did not formally amend its constitution to relinquish its claims to mainland China, which ironically would have angered the PRC. The ROC thus set the conditions for a diplomatic breakthrough across the strait. Officials from each side of the strait met to work out practical matters of cooperation, from the governance of postal services to consular services. The two sides implicitly agreed to compromise on a political formulation, now referred to as the 1992 Consensus. They agreed to disagree on the meaning of “One China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ROC’s unilateral abandonment of the threat of force and the forfeiture of claims of jurisdiction over the mainland should have been the basis for a lasting peace. But Beijing’s response to Taipei’s cessation of a state of hostilities was an escalation of its coercion campaign. Before Taiwan’s first democratic election in June 1995, Taiwan’s president, Lee Teng-hui, made a high-profile visit to his alma mater, Cornell University. The PRC then conducted a series of missile tests in the waters surrounding Taiwan and other military maneuvers in response to what CCP leaders called Lee’s attempts to “split the motherland.” The US and Taiwan had never formally agreed to limit the visits of Taiwan presidents, and the US does not agree that there is a “motherland” that Taiwan is trying to “split.” There has never been a single political CCP-run entity that included Taiwan. This was a provocative escalation by Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC initiated another set of missile tests in the run-up to Taiwan’s first presidential election in 1996 in an attempt to frighten Taiwan’s electorate into voting against Lee and compel the US to rein in what they called Taiwan’s pro-independence forces. In 1999, Lee suggested the two sides negotiate on a “special state-to-state basis” in an effort to break Taipei and Beijing out of a diplomatic stalemate, just seven years after its partial breakthrough. The response from Beijing was a stepped-up rhetorical assault with escalating military maneuvers. Beijing focused on Lee’s use of the term “state-to-state,” despite Lee’s use of the modifier “special” to connote something less than official country-to-country relations. His creative formulation was meant to co-opt independence-minded Taiwanese while providing Beijing with a face-saving way to conduct relations with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s efforts to normalize relations based on a reasonable diplomatic formula that recognized CCP rule over the mainland while avoiding declaring Taiwanese independence were seen in Beijing as dangerous “splittism” (the term the CCP uses for political separatism). Beijing pocketed Taiwanese concessions as it had previous American concessions, but it failed to make any concessions of its own. Moreover, the PRC treated these concessions as provocations justifying further demands and coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This response was delivered by the Chinese General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the height of the US effort to integrate China into the global economy and establish warm commercial relations with Beijing. It occurred as the US dramatically downsized its military following the end of the Cold War. There was certainly cause for Beijing to worry about the military balance with the US after America’s thumping of Saddam Hussein’s military in 1991 — and the prodemocratic rhetoric of both the George H. W. Bush and Clinton administrations. But US actions indicated that the threat to the PRC was receding rather than growing. The Chinese coercion campaign thus began during a time of peace and prosperity for Beijing, when it enjoyed friendly relations with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries and companies had rushed into China to explore commercial opportunities while the PRC embraced foreign expertise and know-how. The Soviet Union had collapsed, removing a long-standing threat to Beijing’s north. Beijing’s ideological problem remained, however: Democracy in Taiwan undermines the CCP’s core tenet that democracy is unsuitable for the Chinese cultural context. The existence of a legitimate constitutional government actually ruling Taiwan, moreover, discredited the CCP’s claim to speak for all Chinese people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having received US and Taiwanese concessions as if they were acts of escalation, the CCP learned during this period of peace and Western outreach and engagement that threats of force could push the US to pressure Taipei. The US sent ships to the Taiwan Strait in response to Chinese missile tests in 1995 and 1996, to be sure. But the PRC convinced then-President Clinton to publicly affirm China’s position on Taiwan, rather than Taipei’s or Washington’s, while speaking on Chinese soil in Shanghai. Beijing demanded that President Clinton repeat the so-called three nos: that the US would not support (1) Taiwan independence, (2) “Two Chinas” or “One China One Taiwan,” or (3) Taiwan’s efforts to participate in international organizations in which statehood is a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The events of 1995–97 also exposed the PRC’s relative military impotence at that time, as the PLA had no military answer to the arrival of US warships in the strait. But Beijing accomplished the political outcome it sought, despite its military weakness, through an apparent escalation that was not backed by actual capability. It made a political demand of Washington based on a military bluff, and Washington complied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A DPP government under Chen Shui-bian was elected in 2000, partially in reaction to China’s military intimidation. As the CCP’s pressure grew on the Chen government, Taipei pushed for greater recognition of Taiwan’s independence. Yet Beijing convinced President George W. Bush to publicly rebuke Taiwan’s president in the company of PRC Premier Wen Jiabao, humiliating Chen in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Xi became general secretary of the CCP in 2012, his initial approach to Taiwan was relatively moderate. Taiwan was governed by a KMT leader, Ma Ying-jeou, who sought more conciliation with Beijing. Xi and Ma met in Singapore in 2015, the first meeting between the leaders of Taiwan and China and a notable Chinese diplomatic olive branch to Taiwan. Moreover, Xi did not protest when Ma took the public position that the two sides had “agreed to disagree” about the meaning of “One China,” another apparent PRC concession. The formula of “One China, different interpretations” was apparently back on the table. This formulation was in essence the same as Lee’s “special state-to-state relations” comment in 1999, as the leaders of the government of Taiwan and China met as coequals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This history is not merely of academic interest. To counter CCP revisionism, US policymakers need to understand it. And, as a matter of policy, the US should insist that Beijing does not get to choose which elected leaders of the ROC it deals with. To date, the US has not called on the PRC to return to the negotiating table with the current Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen based on this precedent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s relatively conciliatory approach to Taiwan did not survive Ma’s presidency, however. When Tsai succeeded Ma in 2016, Xi reverted to the previous CCP posture of threats and demands. During his meeting with Ma, Xi said that “as long as the 1992 Consensus and its core values are acknowledged, we stand ready to have contact.” Tsai did not explicitly accept the language of the 1992 Consensus, charting a different course from an agreement made by her political opponent’s party. This is, of course, the prerogative of any new government. China’s Taiwan Affairs Office criticized her and demanded that she recognize the PRC’s “One China” principle. Tsai nevertheless went as far toward conciliation as Taiwan’s new politics would allow. By 2016, the electorate in Taiwan had little connection to mainland China. The grandchildren of the old KMT were voters who had grown up in a democratic Taiwan. Ties with China were akin to those of Canadians with the US: a shared culture, history, and language but little else, despite the CCP’s insistence otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Beijing was warning Washington about Tsai’s “separatist” and independence proclivities, Tsai conceded in her May 2016 inauguration speech that “the new government will conduct cross-Strait affairs in accordance with the Republic of China Constitution, the Act Governing Relations between the People of Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, and other relevant legislation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This statement was another major concession by a Taiwanese leader. That Tsai represented the native Taiwanese DPP yet accepted that the ROC and Taiwan were the same entity was a difficult internal political maneuver. Crucially, she embraced the reality that the PRC governs the mainland and the ROC on Taiwan does not; she thereby opened the door to diplomatic solutions similar to those of her predecessors. But for Tsai, the meaning of “One China” was to be negotiated, not simply conceded to the PRC. Washington encouraged Tsai’s concession, but it never insisted that the CCP make any similar compromise or live up to Xi’s implicit acceptance of the “different interpretations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi has years of experience dealing with Taiwan as a former party secretary of Fujian province, directly across the strait from Taiwan. He is versed in Taiwanese politics and knows that Tsai went as far as she could go on the issue of “One China.” Yet he chose to escalate the coercion campaign, blaming Tsai for recalcitrance. The US and its allies should have made a more concerted effort, beginning then to call on Xi to return to the negotiating table and not escalate his disagreements with Taiwan’s new government through force and diplomatic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after Tsai was elected, Beijing pressured Panama and São Tomé and Príncipe to shift diplomatic relations from the ROC to the PRC. Beijing shut Taiwan out of international organizations, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Criminal Police Organization, among others. During Tsai’s presidency, the CCP has pressured companies ranging from United Airlines to Snickers to call Taiwan a province of China or face economic penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing also accelerated its campaign of military coercion following Tsai’s accession. The PLA increased the frequency of bomber circumnavigations of Taiwan in late 2016 and made such circumnavigations an enduring reality for the Tsai administration. By late 2017, PLA bombers and support aircraft circumnavigated the island. Beijing modified a civil aviation route near the centerline of the Taiwan Strait in January 2018 to allow commercial airlines to fly over open ocean in the strait, severely taxing Taiwan’s air defense system and air traffic controls. Since February 2018, the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) intensified a pattern of flights through the Miyako Strait, off the east coast of Taiwan in the Philippine Sea, and the Bashi Channel. These flights demonstrate the PLAAF’s ability to “break” the first island chain and establish air dominance over key lifelines for Taiwan and its geographical connection to the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2019, two PLAAF fighters crossed into Taiwan’s side of the median line — an unofficial boundary between Taiwan and the PRC not challenged by the Chinese military since 1999. The military maneuvers were accompanied by statements from China’s Taiwan Affairs Office and the PLA’s Eastern Theater Command about their necessity to guard against “separatists,” as if the PLA were conducting legitimate counterterror operations. In September 2020 a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman stated, “There is no so-called median line in the Strait.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This line had been another means of keeping peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The CCP’s violation and rejection of it was an incremental move to claim the waters and air around Taiwan as its own. The PRC continued this coercive campaign by increasing air incursions into the Taiwanese Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). Taiwan recorded 969 incursions by Chinese warplanes into its ADIZ in 2021 — more than double the roughly 380 carried out in 2020. In 2022, total Chinese air incursions into the ADIZ were 1,115. The PLA continually issues threatening messages in native Taiwanese dialects and allows military commentators to describe the ability of their jets to decapitate the Taiwanese leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These PLA operations are part of Chinese cognitive warfare, what Taiwan calls “cognitive domain warfare” or renzhi yu zuozhan (认知域作战). A Taiwan defense analyst has captured the purpose of this aerospace campaign: “PLA exercises first create an environment of fear, and then the responsibility of causing tension is blamed on ‘Taiwan’s ambitious politicians.’” The CCP aims to influence Taiwanese and American politics through the tension it creates. In manipulating the information space through demonstrations of force, its goal is to get important audiences in Taipei, Washington, and allied capitals to believe more pliant Taiwanese leaders could make this threat go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP has thus put the Taiwanese under the constant threat of ever-escalating violence and political pressure. One purpose of these shows of force across the strait is to coerce the US to change its policy, curtail its relations with Taiwan, come closer to the CCP’s definition of what “One China” means, and force Taipei to come with it on that journey of concessions. The second purpose is to wear down Taiwan’s resistance, undermine DPP rule, and persuade the Taiwanese of their own accord to elect and follow leaders who will concede to China’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC can fully secure its objectives vis-à-vis Taiwan if it achieves either aim. Taiwan cannot continue to resist growing PRC pressure without the active support of Washington and its allies in and beyond the region. If Beijing can reduce or break that support, Taiwan will have no option but to give the PRC what it desires. The CCP can succeed even more fully if it can actually break the will of Taiwanese supporters of policies of autonomy and resistance and elevate compliant Taiwanese politicians to power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US policy risks making a grave error by seeing China’s expanding military operations around Taiwan only through the prism of preparations for an invasion. Those operations may be part of such preparations and may help with them in various ways, but they are also strategic undertakings in their own right and are directly aimed at accomplishing Beijing’s goals. Developing strategies to deter or defeat a Chinese invasion of Taiwan may be ineffective or even counterproductive in preventing the PRC from subjugating Taiwan through a combination of these coercion efforts and the continuing persuasion efforts that accompany them, as we consider below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strategy to protect Taiwan’s autonomy and freedom from Chinese control requires blocking the persuasion and coercion roads to PRC domination of the island and deterring or defeating the compellence road. A US counter-persuasion and -coercion strategy should be focused, tightly sequenced and phased, and deliberate. Chinese political and economic moves to undermine Taiwan’s isolation should be coordinated with demonstrations of US and allied force that can ensure open strategic lines of communication and resupply around Taiwan. The increasingly myopic focus on the supposedly imminent Chinese invasion threat can seriously hinder or prevent entirely the development and implementation of such a strategy. This outcome may be in part what China seeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;compellence&quot;&gt;Compellence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC has unquestionably been developing the capability to compel Taiwanese capitulation by force if coercion and persuasion fail, but Xi’s determination to move to compellence and the imminence of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan both require more rigorous interrogation than either is currently receiving. It would be more strategically apposite for the US to approach concerns about an impending Chinese invasion in the context of ongoing Chinese persuasion and coercion approaches. An invasion or other compellent strategies are possible, but such scenarios would be escalations of current campaigns carrying significant risks and downsides for Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrow focus on the threat of Chinese invasion, moreover, marginalizes an alternative compellence strategy that would flow far more naturally from China’s persuasion and coercion efforts — a strategy of isolation. The US would do well, therefore, to take a step back from the increasingly frantic discussion of ways and means to deter or stop a cross-Strait invasion and instead reconsider the PRC strategic context from which any such decision and operation would emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China did not begin its military modernization with the express purpose of invading Taiwan. As we have stated, the PLA modernization campaign started in the early 1990s, when the PRC observed America’s military modernization demonstrated in the deserts of Iraq and Kuwait. The Gulf War shocked the world’s major militaries by demonstrating that a highly trained, professional, all-volunteer force equipped with precision strike and stealth capabilities could humiliate the world’s fourth largest army rapidly and with extremely low casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian military theorists were seized by this phenomenon and pushed for the modernization and professionalization of the Russian military in the following decades. Many other countries began abandoning long-held conscription practices and turning to professional volunteer militaries equipped with more advanced technology. The Chinese did the same and for the same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;US policy risks making a grave error by seeing China’s expanding military operations around Taiwan only through the prism of preparations for an invasion.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense analysts have grown increasingly concerned that the PLA has a set goal of 2027 to invade Taiwan, based on comments by outgoing commander of US Indo-Pacific Command Adm. Phil Davidson (ret.). But the primary importance of 2027 is that it is the 100-year anniversary of the PLA’s founding and is thus likely a deadline for it to reach new modernization milestones. The PLA can likely already conduct an invasion if ordered, albeit with high risk; as the modernization process continues, and in every year that passes, the PLA will have more capability to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA’s modernization effort is general-purpose, rather than narrowly optimized for a cross-Strait invasion. It began at a time when the PRC was pocketing US and Taiwanese concessions and increasing its demands; it continued through periods of apparent Taiwanese and American conciliation of Beijing and through periods of easing of tensions between Beijing and Taipei. Xi may have accelerated the expected date of completion of this decades-long general military buildup, shifting it into a specific preparation for a particular invasion scenario, but there is no direct and publicly available evidence of this assessment. US policymakers would do well to question the notion that this program’s date of completion represents some kind of specified invasion date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modernization program naturally enhances the PRC’s military abilities to invade Taiwan even against US resistance, but it also enhances the PLA’s abilities to pursue another form of compellence — isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolation.&lt;/strong&gt; A strategy of isolating Taiwan by air and sea flows naturally from China’s ongoing persuasion and coercion efforts. Those efforts explicitly aim to get the last few states that diplomatically recognize Taiwan to shift their recognition to Beijing. They aim to cajole states and businesses to accept and promulgate the Chinese version of the Beijing-Taipei relationship, rather than Taiwan’s — a form of informational isolation. That aim includes efforts to prevent other heads and senior leaders of foreign states from visiting Taipei or receiving Taiwanese officials in their capitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is thus in part also a strategy of diplomatic isolation. And Beijing constantly presses other countries to refrain from providing Taiwan with military equipment — a form of military-cooperation isolation. One set of aims of the current coercion and persuasion efforts is thus to use means short of the actual use of force to cut Taipei’s connections to the outside world, other than those that might run through Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The natural next escalation in these efforts is not invasion, but rather adding the overt use of force to complete the isolation. Beijing could declare a quarantine or blockade of Taiwan on some pretext and deploy its maritime power and airpower to enforce such a policy. The blockade need not be total from the start. The PRC could begin by deploying ships covered by aircraft around the island to inspect all vessels entering and leaving Taiwan’s ports for some claimed contraband — advanced weapons systems, perhaps. Beijing could similarly insist on inspecting aircraft, although attempting to enforce such a demand without actually shooting down civilian aircraft would be challenging. How many civilian aircraft, on the other hand, would continue operating through skies full of PLAAF aircraft threatening to down them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If such initial efforts failed to bring Taipei to a position satisfactory to Beijing, the PRC could escalate further to an actual blockade. Taiwan is unalterably dependent on external resources to survive, so it is almost impossible to imagine that a protracted blockade could fail to secure Taipei’s surrender on almost any terms Beijing might dictate. Moreover, given its unique lack of official status in international affairs, it may be especially vulnerable to demonstrations that it can be isolated. It would be difficult to muster the kind of defiance that Britain did under attack from Nazi Germany: Taiwan lacks Britain’s long history and strategic traditions, general cohesion, and unbreakable morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This form of compellence not only is the most natural and obvious progression from the current PRC campaigns but also seems to present a far more attractive balance of risk and reward to Beijing. It does not in principle require the PLA to engage in combat. If Taiwan’s supporters make clear they will not challenge such a blockade, then Taiwan might surrender without fighting. If either Taiwan or its supporters decide to challenge it, moreover, they run the risk of appearing to have fired the first shot, provided the PRC has arranged matters such that running the blockade requires shooting at ships or aircraft blocking routes to ports or airfields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the PRC has not managed such an arrangement, then the PLA might need to shoot first, but it might begin by hitting a civilian plane or ship. Such an action would obviously incur outrage and opprobrium, on the one hand, but it would also place Taiwan and its partners in the position of having to decide how to respond. That position would likely be uncomfortable, as competing pressures to respond to the Chinese action and support Taiwan would be offset by fears that the pro-Taiwan coalition would be initiating a war. To see this dynamic at work, we have only to look at the extensive Western discourse about the fears of prompting Russian escalation by providing defensive systems to Ukraine following Moscow’s unprovoked and illegal invasion. The West’s early wavering about supporting Ukraine against a blatantly illegal and unjust invasion requires considerably more attention than it has received, since it offers Beijing encouragement as it considers escalation toward Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isolation strategy has some downsides for Beijing, to be sure. It would be an obvious escalation to the use of force and could trigger the US and regional states to mobilize for war, thereby depriving the PRC of the element of surprise it might otherwise hope to achieve at some level in a no-notice invasion scenario. If the US and its partners responded to the isolation rapidly and in force, Beijing could find it has made the prospects of a successful invasion much worse by bringing its adversaries’ advanced military capabilities into the vicinity of Taiwan without interdicting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC would thus need to be prepared to choose either of the two most plausible actions in response to the deployment of considerable US and allied firepower toward Taiwan: de-escalate and await another moment or escalate to regional war. If the strength and determination of the US and partner response seemed to Beijing too high to challenge, then the PRC could back away, accept a temporary defeat, and develop alternative approaches for another try later on. Beijing could prepare in advance to mitigate the unpleasantness of having to climb down by defining a lesser political objective that it could be reasonably sure to accomplish — or plausibly claim to have accomplished — before it had to back away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC could alternatively ensure that its initial preparations for the isolation campaign include preparations to escalate to major conflict if a US-led coalition challenged it seriously. This approach might not be easily distinguishable from preparations for a full-scale invasion in that it would likely include putting in place all the capabilities needed to exclude US-led forces from the vicinity of Taiwan and drive off or destroy any already near the island. It might include the preparation of an invasion force, depending on whether Beijing believed it could achieve its aims by the escalatory application of the isolation approach. The PLA would face a potentially much worse military position at the start of such an escalation than it could hope to face in a surprise invasion scenario, but Beijing might also calculate that the threat of invasion could reduce the willingness of the US-led coalition to push matters to full-scale war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time-space relationships could also be central to any PRC isolation approach. The PRC appears to believe it is developing a strong network of collaborators and fellow travelers in Taiwan and that its own political warfare elements on the island may be able to paralyze initial Taiwanese responses and quickly sap the island’s will to resist. An isolation strategy would almost certainly begin with the successful isolation of the island by air and sea; any response to break blockades or quarantines would likely take days or weeks to negotiate and then bring into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial shock of isolation could engender strong psychological effects, especially if China manages to cut Taiwan’s internet connectivity and other means of communicating with the outside world. Beijing might calculate that its efforts and agents could bring Taiwan to surrender before the US is able to break through Taiwan’s isolation. The PRC leadership is moderately likely to be wrong in such a calculation; overestimating one’s ability to break the will of an adversary is one of the most common mistakes in coercion and compellence strategies. But miscalculation would change the outcome, not the decision to make the attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Beijing pursued an isolation strategy, it would undermine the prospects of an immediate escalation to full-scale attack. But this approach is still attractive as it offers the possibility of achieving Beijing’s aims without having to engage in a complicated amphibious invasion. An isolation strategy poses a potentially higher risk that the PRC might have to back down in an embarrassing fashion, but it offsets that risk by offering a climbdown before major hostilities break out and therefore before China suffers significant combat losses. It also flows most naturally from the long-standing persuasion and coercion campaigns China has been pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invasion.&lt;/strong&gt; Xi might nevertheless decide not to bother with isolation efforts, instead driving straight toward his final objective via invasion. The Chinese idealized version of this strategy would of course be attractive to Beijing: A brief period of increased tension covers the execution of well-planned and rehearsed PLA mobilization for an invasion. A short air-missile campaign shatters Taiwan’s defense and government structures while Chinese political warfare agents on the island become active, wrecking any hope of coherent Taiwanese preparations for defense. The massive Chinese fleet sweeps quickly across the strait and begins disembarking troops and vehicles onto Taiwanese beaches almost before Taipei knows what’s happening, and Chinese troops raise the PRC flag over government buildings in Taipei while policymakers in Washington and Tokyo debate what to do. Xi makes a speech from the Presidential Office in Taipei, and “splittism” is forever defeated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that even Xi seriously entertains this fantasy. The statements and actions of American and Japanese leaders and officials offer no reason for Xi to be confident that the US and Japan (or Australia) would stand idly by and watch this spectacle. On the contrary, from the PRC’s perspective, President Joe Biden has been setting informational and military conditions to prepare to defend Taiwan against an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi has clearly also been observing the disastrous Russian invasion of Ukraine that highlighted additional factors of concern. The Russians thought they had thoroughly penetrated Ukrainian society and government with their own agents and fellow travelers and built a campaign on the assumption that Ukrainians would not fight. They were wrong on all counts. The Russians also wildly overestimated their own military capabilities and competence and underestimated the inevitable effects of battlefield friction. The PLA is almost certainly more competent and able to handle friction than the Potemkin army with which Russia invaded, but friction is real in any war and the more so in complex large-scale amphibious invasions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese military leaders and Xi himself must therefore take seriously the possibilities that Taiwan will fight and that the political warfare efforts on the island will be only partially successful, that the US and its allies will respond with force rapidly and determinedly, that the PLA will not perform optimally, and, even if nothing else does, that the friction inherent in war will lead to setbacks and losses. None of these observations are groundbreaking. They serve only to say that Xi must recognize the high risks associated with invading Taiwan — unless he is a thoroughgoing fool, which he does not in any way appear to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear enough that an island of 24 million people cannot hope to defeat the massed forces of a country of 1.4 billion. The best that Taiwan on its own could hope would be to inflict painful losses on an invading Chinese force. Properly equipped and determined to fight, Taiwan might be able to do so. We shall set aside further consideration of this aspect of the scenario, however, to focus on those that are more dangerous to Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debate roils the US national security establishment about America’s capacity to stop a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Some argue that the PLA’s ballistic, cruise, and now hypersonic missiles render America’s aircraft carriers hopelessly vulnerable and that China’s air and missile arsenal and A2AD systems force the US to rely on bases far from Taiwan and on long-range standoff missiles alone, ultimately dooming any chance the US might have to stop the attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much hinges in these scenarios on when and whether Beijing would attack US bases at Guam and Okinawa, at least, and on assumptions about America’s ability to use bases in South Korea and the Japanese home islands. If the US retains the ability to use Guam and Okinawa, so the reasoning often goes, then it might be able to challenge the PLA’s ability to cross the strait or at least to impose losses that Beijing would find unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These discussions are important for considerations of invasion scenarios. One struggles to recall a successful amphibious invasion in the era of combat aircraft conducted without at least localized air supremacy. Amphibious ships are large, vulnerable targets whose sinking entails the deaths of hundreds or thousands of soldiers and the loss of large amounts of vehicles and supplies. Few if any militaries have been willing to risk sailing them to shore in the face of enemy aircraft or an enemy’s ability to concentrate volumes of high-payload munitions on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China cannot deprive the US of all ability to strike a PLA landing force. Long-range stealth bombers can refuel out of the A2AD bubble and fire missiles, some of which will almost surely hit and destroy their targets. US attack submarines and other platforms can fire volleys of cruise missiles that PLA air defenses will not completely shoot down. If China invades and the US is determined to defend Taiwan, the PLA will take losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale and consequences of those losses depend heavily, however, on whether the US can use its carriers and regional bases. The more of those assets the American military can use, the more severe the damage it can impose on the invasion force, possibly up to and including its destruction. That is one of the reasons many discussions of a Chinese invasion scenario assume that the PLA would attack US bases on Guam and Okinawa, at least, and possibly on the Japanese home islands. They often assume that South Korea would not allow the US to use its bases on the Korean Peninsula in a war that, in principle, interests Seoul very little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese military technocrats would likely prefer to begin the attack in this fashion and deprive the US of as much regional capacity as possible. The geostrategic advisability of doing so, however, rests on political rather than military considerations. Would the US absorb an attack on Guam and not thereafter regard itself as at war with China? Would Tokyo regard attacks on US bases on Japanese territory as bilateral US-China affairs that do not constitute acts of war against Japan? Would the US, having lost immediate use of its other regional bases, not activate the US–Republic of Korea mutual defense treaty (which, unlike the US treaty with Japan, actually is mutual and obliges Seoul to come to the aid of the US if the US is attacked in the region)? Would Seoul refuse that activation, thereby risking the loss of its most important ally?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As both Russia and the allies have learned, no prewar assumption holds after a war begins. Ukraine’s fighting will is beyond what analysts imagined before the conflict, the US and NATO are equipping Ukraine far beyond what was thought possible, Washington has reinforced NATO forces on the eastern flank, and there are now two new NATO members under consideration. Turning back to Asia, it is hard to imagine South Korea wanting to remain neutral once Australia, Japan, and the US (and possibly some other NATO countries) are in the fight; in a scenario in which US ships, territory, and allies are struck, the US will likely pay whatever price its allies Thailand and the Philippines demand for the use of their airspace and bases in their territory. The issue of South Korean sympathy for Taiwan (or lack thereof) is a red herring. Seoul will have to make decisions in the context of the viability of its long-term reliance on the US and America’s allies — and the possible impact of refusing US requests for help on that reliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely Xi and his lieutenants have considered the geopolitical consequences of trying to succeed operationally. If not, the China problem may be bigger than most analysts realize. In that case, either Xi is as isolated and delusional as Putin was before invading Ukraine, and therefore is undeterrable, or his grand strategic objectives have changed. From building up comprehensive national power and making incremental gains to undermine US alliances and reshape the world order, Xi would have transformed his grand strategy into one of forcefully obtaining hegemony in Asia. If Xi’s objectives have changed in such a fashion, then the US should not be preparing to counter only an invasion of Taiwan but rather a series of Chinese campaigns for hegemony. The assumption of this report is that China’s strategy toward Taiwan is part of a unification campaign, a close cousin of the successful Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang campaigns, and that any other gains Xi thinks he can secure from successful unification are secondary and opportunistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might restate these considerations more straightforwardly. A PRC invasion plan that relies on attacking Guam and US positions in Japan early in the conflict would immediately bring China into open war with the US, Japan, and possibly South Korea. US policy analysts might broodingly fear that the US and its regional allies would allow even such attacks to glance off them from a geopolitical standpoint and work to treat the war as a “Taiwan crisis” with no larger ramifications. We needn’t get into that argument ourselves to observe that Xi would, again, be a complete fool to be confident of such a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serious political and military leaders in Beijing must thus consider that a decision to invade Taiwan immediately confronts them with a second extremely thorny decision: Either Xi accepts the much greater risks to the success of the military operation if China does not attack US bases at once, or he must accept the real possibility that the limited invasion of Taiwan could rapidly become a full-scale regional or even global war with the US and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;An invasion would be an extraordinarily risky undertaking to any Chinese leader not besotted with his own power and deluded by stupid or dishonest generals and political advisers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not by any means intend to suggest that Xi might not decide that either risk is acceptable; he might. We certainly do not mean to say that strong and prompt US responses or US and American-allied escalations are certain or would be successful. Those arguing that, as things stand today, China could invade Taiwan and the US couldn’t stop the invasion might be right. Calls for increasing America’s military capabilities to defeat such a Chinese attack at acceptable costs to the US and its allies are surely cogent and should be heeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even this cursory examination of some of the invasion-scenario implications suggests that it would be an extraordinarily risky undertaking to any Chinese leader not besotted with his own power and deluded by stupid or dishonest generals and political advisers. Most leaders would prefer less risky approaches that offer the promise of securing the same outcome at lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US policy therefore cannot accept as a given that Xi is simply preparing to invade and that, when the PLA is ready, he will. We must instead reopen the aperture to see other plausible roads Xi could take to seizing Taiwan and develop strategies to block all of them rather than focusing on only one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This discussion would be of merely academic interest if preparations to defeat the cross-Strait invasion also included blocking the persuasion, coercion, and isolation-compellence roads. Unfortunately, though, the approaches generally advocated to stop the invasion actively undermine efforts to block Xi’s other roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the invasion scenario is the only one the US and its allies plan to block, the temptation will grow to pull back from the Chinese A2AD bubble, abandon reliance on Guam and Okinawa, and focus on increasing America’s long-range strike capabilities. Maximizing perceived operational effectiveness would override geopolitical necessity. Such a move would potentiate the PRC’s persuasion, coercion, and isolation efforts. It could be the case that these efforts actually enhance America’s ability to defend Taiwan and therefore increase the likelihood the US would come to Taiwan’s defense, although we question both assumptions. But would it seem that way to the Taiwanese?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual optics of that strategy involve withdrawing visible US presence from the near vicinity of Taiwan, after all. The more imminent war becomes, under this approach, the faster US carrier battle groups steam away from the island, the more US strike aircraft fly north and west from Okinawa and Guam, and the more American military bases throughout the region move into defensive rather than offensive postures. The Taiwanese would be remarkable people indeed to observe those phenomena, see the growing concentration of Chinese military assets around their island, and conclude that they should be ready to fight to the death, confident that America will be with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Openly accepting the premise that US carriers cannot survive Chinese attacks also means openly stating that moving carriers toward Taiwan, Japan, or through the strait is always an American bluff and should not be seen as a serious demonstration of Washington’s willingness or ability to fight. The utility of such freedom of navigation operations could be questioned in any event, but accepting the widely held premises about the poor US prospects for defeating a cross-Strait invasion today makes them worse than meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These discussions all tend to undermine the likely effectiveness of any strategies the US and its partners might develop to try to block the persuasion and coercion roads to the conquest of Taiwan, but they don’t preclude the construction and implementation of such strategies. Even advocates of the standoff approach to defending Taiwan against invasion, after all, generally agree that the US should develop such counterstrategies even if they also generally dismiss the significance of Chinese persuasion and coercion campaigns through their confidence that invasion is inevitable and even imminent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most serious problem with focusing narrowly on preventing the cross-Strait invasion from standoff ranges is that it almost invites Xi to try the isolation strategy. Breaking blockades requires presence. The US certainly could use long-range precision weapons to sink Chinese ships blocking or interfering with merchant vessels trying to move into and out of Taiwan’s ports — until those Chinese ships move too close to those merchant vessels to permit their safe destruction. And driving PLAAF aircraft out of Taiwan’s skies is not likely a task that can be undertaken from far-over-the-horizon bases except by destroying all the PLAAF bases on the mainland from which such operations are conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even assuming that that is a feasible military undertaking, it nevertheless would move the US rapidly toward the tremendously escalatory step of conducting a large-scale air attack on the Chinese homeland. Any approach to breaking the blockade with standoff munitions, finally, requires the US to use an immediate lethal approach to respond to a Chinese effort conducted, possibly, with less-than-lethal force. It could put the responsibility for escalating to a shooting war on the US, even though China created the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main problem with approaches seeking to break a blockade from standoff distances is not that doing so is impossible but rather that promising to do so is insufficiently credible. It is almost impossible to imagine a scenario in which the Chinese begin to interfere with Taiwan’s communications and trade with the rest of the world, whereafter the US instantly responds by sinking Chinese ships. Beijing’s isolation strategy would almost inevitably have some time to work before a serious US response along these lines even started — let alone before it succeeded, if it could. Xi might miscalculate the odds of securing Taiwan’s concession in that interval, as we have observed above, but the relatively low risks he would run compared with those entailed in a full-scale invasion make it more plausible that he would accept the risk of miscalculation here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a solution to the conundrum these challenges pose to the US: Design a counterinvasion strategy that includes a counter-isolation strategy. The far-over-the-horizon counterinvasion strategy is a problem only if it precludes or excludes counterisolation efforts. The US should and, indeed, must have far-over-the-horizon capabilities in any scenario. But it must also develop ways to operate within China’s A2AD zone, including within the range of China’s hypersonic missiles. It must be able to meet a Chinese blockade effort centered on nonlethal force with a nonlethal counter-isolation effort of its own. It must avoid the optics of withdrawing its military power from the theater as the threat of Chinese attack grows and instead, ideally, create the object of credible military power flowing toward Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recognize that these demands are easy to make and hard to meet. We have no specific suggestions to offer about how to do so technically or tactically. Our purpose in this report, rather, is to say that actually keeping Taiwan free is even harder than it seems to many. We cannot reduce the problem to one specific scenario, and we actually must focus on solving extraordinarily hard military problems to enable strategies that can defeat not only the most dangerous courses of action Beijing might pursue but also the most likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（10日）踏入審訊第23天。區諾軒今接受代表港島區參選人楊雪盈和彭卓棋的大狀盤問，區諾軒同意楊雪盈政治議程主要提倡文化及動保政策，而楊雪盈並非任何港島候選人指定的替補人選，卻在初選落敗後報名參選立法會，是有違「35+」共識。區諾軒又同意，港島協調會議、初選提名表格及「35+」文件均無提及戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步〉一文，而否決預算案亦從來不是港島會議的重要議題，亦無聽過彭卓棋稱當選後會無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方一度欲問，能否說戴耀廷是將有意參與初選者「帶上船」，再試圖將否決預算案的說法「強加」在他們身上，惟法官指區諾軒無法回答該問題，辯方終無繼續就此發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒同意楊雪盈政治議程倡文化及動保政策&quot;&gt;區諾軒同意楊雪盈政治議程倡文化及動保政策&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表吳政亨和余慧明的大律師石書銘表示完成盤問，續由代表楊雪盈的大律師張耀良進行盤問。區諾軒同意，於2015年首次認識楊雪盈，當時楊有意參選灣仔區議會，向他諮詢競選的意見，楊成功當選後亦不時向他諮詢擔任區議員的意見。張耀良問，故區對楊的政治議程和任區議員的志向有一定認識，區稱「我係知道嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 楊雪盈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，楊雪盈是獨立候選人，沒有任何攻治聯繫，於2019年區選再次當選。張耀良續指，楊的政治議程與其他候選人略為不同，她在論壇自我介紹為有藝術教育背景，並在公眾服務特別提倡有關藝術和設計的議題，區同意，形容楊「好關注文化政策」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區確認，楊是非政府組織「香港文化監察」的主席，在任時曾推動不少文化政策，形容她很關注香港陶瓷業和泥窯的地方保育。他亦同意，楊曾於2018年成功爭取政府撥款10億，將低用量或少用的政府大樓改作文化用途；亦有倡議動物保護，爭取用政府無使用的土地拯救動物。張耀良問，上述是否其政治議程的主要政策，區指「可以咁講」，並解釋自2015年起有與楊恆常見面作直接溝通，故對相關事實的認知是由楊告知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意楊雪盈初選落敗後仍參選立會-有違35共識&quot;&gt;區同意楊雪盈初選落敗後仍參選立會 有違35+共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張耀良續就35+計劃發問，區諾軒早前供稱楊雪盈曾派代表出席一次協調會議，楊本人曾出席兩次。張續問，據區的記憶，楊雪盈會上是否不曾對戴耀廷有關否決預算案和五大訴求的看法表達意見？區指「佢冇表達」，亦「冇乜點表達」其他意見，但曾於第二和第三次會議對替補機制表達較強烈意見，當時羅冠聰提倡以「靈童制」，即候選人指定的方式替補被DQ者，但楊雪盈和徐子見不同意，認為應用「排名制」，即第二高票數的人作替補。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區確認，楊雪盈最終於初選落敗，但在2020年7月報名參選立法會。張耀良一度問及楊是否有違「主流」做法，惟法官陳慶偉和李運騰均指沒有所謂「主流」。區其後確認，港島區在第二、三次會議投票取得共識，決定採用「靈童制」，但未決定派出名單數量，而其他選區均預設「靈童制」。法官李運騰遂問，楊雪盈最終報名參選立法會，是否即有違35+共識？區答「係，因為根據靈童制，要係勝出者指定一位替補人選，你先至得到35+支持」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官追問替補人選-區稱有預備惟無沒透露是誰-但楊雪盈不是&quot;&gt;法官追問替補人選 區稱有預備惟無沒透露是誰 但楊雪盈不是&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在法官陳仲衡詢問下，表示袁嘉蔚和梁晃維均是被DQ的初選勝出者，他一度不肯定鄭達鴻有否被DQ，問「鄭達鴻係咪都因為公民黨嘅緣故 DQ ⋯？」鄭發笑。翻查資料，鄭當時亦被DQ。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰再問，楊雪盈是否不曾被任何初選勝出者指定為替補人選？區確認。法官陳仲衡續問，港島候選人有否指定候補人選，區則答：「根據 WhatsApp 紀錄，佢哋各自表示預備咗，但佢哋最後都冇講係邊個。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上早前提及，初選參加者報名時須交一萬元按金，若違初選共識便會沒收。法官陳慶偉續問，楊的一萬元按金有否被充公？區答：「呢個唔係我管理範圍，唔好意思，可以問返民主動力嘅代表」，陳志全等發笑。陳仲衡最後問，區諾軒是否知道，楊是不是港島候選人的替補？區肯定答：「不是。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱彭卓棋與戴耀廷因初選首次會面-不肯定戴曾否發訊息&quot;&gt;區稱彭卓棋與戴耀廷因初選首次會面 不肯定戴曾否發訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀其後開始盤問。區諾軒確認，2020年3月26日舉行的首次港島區協調會議，是港島區首次及唯一一次提及運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案，亦確認港島區候選人只有一個於2020年6月29日成立的 WhatsApp 群組。區並確認彭卓棋曾出席港島全部3個協調會議，亦是該群組成員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉提及，區曾提到此前有群組發放訊息。區解釋，是戴耀廷利用 WhatsApp 的廣播功能個別通知候選人，而非互相交流的群組，並在法官李運騰提問下確認，除了九龍東一區於3月已成立「35+九東立選座談會」群組，其他地方選區的 WhatsApp 群組均在6月才相繼成立，此前均由戴耀廷個別發放訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒確認，他與戴耀廷3月在李永財議員辦事處與彭卓棋團隊會面，是戴與彭的第一次見面，而除非二人私下有會面，否則他們其後的見面只是在協調會議中。盧敏儀問及，在區在場的情況下，戴和彭是否沒有交換電話，區稱「我冇辦法講到咁仔細」，盧再問，故區是否不知道戴曾否向彭發訊息，區指只能從大方向說，戴耀廷慣常於每次協調會議向各參與者交換電話號碼，並向他們發放訊息，只是他不能精準說出戴曾否找某些人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒確認初選提名表格35文件及協調會議均無提真攬炒十步&quot;&gt;區諾軒確認初選提名表格、35+文件及協調會議均無提〈真攬炒十步〉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀續提及，區曾於宣布退出初選工作翌日，在港台節目指戴耀廷於〈真攬炒十步〉一文的觀點應與初選分開審視，並問事實上，是否在任何提名表格、35+計劃文件和港島區協調會議均沒有提及過該篇文章，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧續問，那能否說〈真攬炒十步〉一文，與初選其實是「分開（separate）」的？主控周天行站起身，指「分開」一詞太籠統，法官李運騰亦澄清，辯方問題是否指「攬炒十步」並非初選一部分（not part of the 35+ project）。法官陳仲衡指，該文章所涵蓋的範圍似乎比35+更廣泛，問題應為「35+」是否文章的一部分。法官陳慶偉着辯方重新考慮問題，李運騰補充否則會適得其反（backfire）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀指對答案感到滿意，即35+計劃任何文件和港島區協調會議都沒有提及〈真攬炒十步〉一文，區其後再次確認，「文件同香港島嘅協調會都冇（提及戴的觀點）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問戴耀廷是否強加否決預算案想法在參與者-官指證人不能回答&quot;&gt;辯方問戴耀廷是否強加否決預算案想法在參與者 官指證人不能回答&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀其後再問，能否說戴耀廷是將有意參與初選的人帶上船（took people interested in primary on board），再試圖將否決預算案的說法強加（impose）於上了船的人身上。法官陳慶偉指，其問題太長和費解，亦不認為區諾軒能回答，「他怎能知道戴耀廷是否將看法強加於其他人身上？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧遂改問，戴是否先接觸有興趣參選的人，而港島區協調會議的討論焦點在於初選機制，如參選人被「DQ」後的替補機制、選票數量，否決財政預算案從來不是重要議題。區確認，重申否決預算案只是於首次會議由戴耀廷提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱無聽過彭卓棋提會無差別否決預算案&quot;&gt;區稱無聽過彭卓棋提會無差別否決預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續確認，彭卓棋是獨立候選人，無政治聯繫，而案發時他與彭互相認識，彭亦從無向他提及一旦當選，會無差別否決預算案。盧敏儀再問，有否聽過彭向其他人提及該看法，區再指「所有被告問我都係咁講架啦，由返當事人公開嘅言行去決定，我只係有資格去評論我同佢嘅交流」，並確認他在場下，沒聽過彭向其他人表示會無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審，至現時為止，鄭達鴻、梁國雄、吳政亨、余慧明、楊雪盈及彭卓棋6人已完成盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WT6r3HP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（10日）踏入審訊第23天。區諾軒續接受九龍西何啟明及劉偉聰盤問，區同意在九西首次協調會議，否決預算案的議題僅由戴耀廷「單向」介紹，而在第二次會議除張崑陽和岑子杰外，其他人沒有就此表態，最終各區亦沒有就否決財案達成共識，承認會議上有「分歧」。區又形容，何啟明所屬的民協為溫和的傳統民主派，亦「從來沒有看李伯盧（吳政亨）為（初選）組織者的一部分」，吳聞言微笑。至於自辯的劉偉聰，指出他並無如區所言出席第二次會議，區指不排除記憶有錯，但已盡力記憶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意首次九西協調會議-否決預算案議題不獲關注&quot;&gt;區同意首次九西協調會議 否決預算案議題不獲關注&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何啟明的大律師阮偉明進行盤問，指出何啟明首次出現在本案中，是在2020年3月24日九龍西首次協調會議，當時會議主要討論協調機制，包括誰可參選、預計勝出議席等，戴耀廷曾提及否決財政預算案，但該議題沒有得到任何關注，會後亦沒有達成任何共識，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6s6xGFA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 何啟明&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阮續指，第二次協調會議於4月29日舉行，是在戴耀廷發表〈真攬炒十步〉一文的翌日，惟焦點仍在協調機制，區同意。阮再指，當時張崑陽曾提及戴的文章，戴並因此作出回應，但此外其他人士對該議題不感興趣，區同意，並補充岑子杰曾提出質疑，但「除此之外就冇其他嘅嘢啦」，之後亦沒有第三次協調會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;初稿提否決預算案僅戴耀廷單向介紹-除岑子杰張崑陽外無人表態&quot;&gt;初稿提否決預算案僅戴耀廷「單向」介紹 除岑子杰張崑陽外無人表態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒同意，戴耀廷首次會議準備的「35+計劃」文件，提及初選機制，但沒有觸及否決預算案。而在首次會議後，戴曾向與會者發出「35+立會過半計劃 民主派九西協調機制（初稿）」文件，該文件加入會運用權力否決預算案的條文，但區不知道戴是否實際上有發給所有人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指根據該初稿，似乎否決預算案的議題曾在首次會議提及，但問區，事實上是否不曾有任何相關討論？區指「我只能夠話戴耀廷介紹嘅時候有講過」。阮再指，事實上相關議題只是「單向」地由戴耀廷介紹，而非與會者之間有「討論」，區稱：「既然冇其他人回應，咁其實都係一種單向性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問，初稿在與會者間傳閱後，有沒有人就否決預算案提出反對。區指「就我憶述，就冇其他人對呢個文件有特別嘅討論」，亦「冇特別有人提出反對」。李運騰續指，一般開會議程均會通過前一次會議的紀錄，惟區指，九西第二次會議並無相關程序，並再重提該次會議「最鮮明」反對否決預算案是岑子杰，他指社民連支持全民退休保障，此外「我冇記得其他人講其他嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區早前亦稱，張崑陽在會上表示支持財政預算案，辯方續問，能否說會上沒有人同意張崑陽的說法，亦沒有人反對岑的說法？區再謂：「我諗只能夠話大家都冇表態囉。」他確認，當天會議何啟明、劉偉聰、馮達浚、黃碧雲與毛孟靜助理都有出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區確認協調會議共識不包括否決預算案69才達成協議&quot;&gt;區確認協調會議共識不包括否決預算案、6.9才達成協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就協調會議的共識，區重申各區會議最終達成4項共識，包括同意舉行初選、目標議席、替補機制及會舉辦初選論壇，其中九龍西目標贏4席，但打算投票後再決定出選名單數量。辯方續指，上述4項共識並不包括否決預算案，區指「的確喺會議之間係有分歧」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒早前供稱，戴耀廷於6月9日初選記者會前，曾在組織者群組發出各區協調機制文件，內有「會積極運用／會運用」權力否決預算案的字眼。辯方再問該些文件是否理應代表由戴耀廷達成的共識，但明顯地參與者就否決預算案一點沒有達成共識，區表示，只能說戴發出該些檔案後「呢啲檔案被視為共識」。阮偉明續指，6月9日初選記者會談及初選機制細節，能否說當天才就35+達成協議？區答：「可以咁講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指從無視李伯盧為初選組織者一部分&quot;&gt;區諾軒指從無視「李伯盧」為初選組織者一部分&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阮偉明其後就不同概念着區澄清。就「攬炒」，區同意民主派的光譜廣闊，故不同人對「攬炒」有不同理解。就「墨落無悔」聲明，區指與任何協調會議的討論結果「完全無關」，只是因應戴耀廷於6月9日記者會表示參與者毋須簽署共同綱領，所衍生的結果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於戴耀廷撰文提及立會過半是「大殺傷力憲制武器」，區指戴案發期間持續使用該字眼形容其主張，惟區本人從未講過相關字眼。區續稱，根據《基本法》第49至52條，立法會的確「有一套好完整嘅機制」處理立會與特首之間的關係，包括否決財政預算案後解散立法會及特首須辭職，而戴於文章亦清楚解釋該權力，並「說成是武器」。李運騰追問區「武器」的意思，是攻擊性（attacking）或防禦性（defending），區指應採納文章就此方面的解釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後欲就「三投三不投」運動作盤問，李運騰指區與該運動無關，惟辯方指區是初選組織者。李續問，區有否以任何形式參與「三投三不投」，區表示沒有，而且「我從來沒有看李伯盧（吳政亨網名）為組織者的一部分」，吳政亨聞言微笑，握緊右拳往下輕輕一振。法官再問，是否即不視吳政亨為「35+」組織者，區再答「正確」，吳政亨望向鄒家成笑及戚眉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒形容民協不止是傳統民主派-更站在較溫和位置&quot;&gt;區諾軒形容民協不止是傳統民主派 更站在較溫和位置&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問，區諾軒作為初選組織者，是否盡力確保初選合法，區諾軒指「我的確盡過最大嘅努力」，並就辯方提出的《個人資料（私隱）條例》、《選舉條例》、社交距離有關法例及《基本法》，「我都記得我有唔同嘅措施，嘗試努力地避免唔同嘅法律風險」，惟組織初選時尚未訂立《國安法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最後，區確認與何啟明認識，但二人並不相熟，並知悉何為民協成員。被問及是否將民協歸類為傳統民主派，區形容「佢哋不單係傳統嘅民主派，更加係企喺較為溫和嘅一部分」，並憶述他與民協「最緊密的合作」就是關注領展議題，強調公屋資產私有化是民生問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰會議曾指初選性質不民主指沒如區稱出席第二次協調會議&quot;&gt;劉偉聰會議曾指初選性質「不民主」、指沒如區稱出席第二次協調會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後輪到自辯的大律師劉偉聰，法官陳慶偉問他希望最先或最後進行盤問（「“Do you wish to go first or go last?”」），劉回應指「我希望現在開始盤問（“I wish to go now.”）」，引起眾人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IgXnIY1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
▲ 大律師 劉偉聰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒在盤問下，確認案發時他與劉只知道對方的名字，而劉有出席首次九龍西協調會議，亦記得劉曾在會上關注初選因局限某些人參選，故性質有「不民主」之處。劉續指，區曾稱他有參與第二次會議，惟事實上他並無參與當天會議。區指「我只會話我係憑住我嘅記憶去作供」，法官李運騰問區是否同意劉的說法，抑或他亦不肯定，區指「我的確冇更加多嘅證據話佢係有出席，如果我真係錯嘅，我好歡迎大家否定」，多名被告發笑。李運騰再問區是否可能記錯，區指不排除這個可能，「但我已經盡全力去記憶整件事嘅經過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰指直至控方提供方收到協調機制初稿-區稱相關檔案是戴耀廷視為共識&quot;&gt;劉偉聰指直至控方提供方收到協調機制初稿 區稱相關檔案是戴耀廷視為「共識」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就區諾軒稱，戴耀廷在會後將九西協調機制初稿發送給與會者，劉偉聰問有沒有可能戴沒有發送予所有人。區指只知道戴會後發給與會人士，但無參與整個過程，無法知道是否每人都「妥為傳達」，並在法官陳仲衡提問下，指他無收到任何與會者投訴指無收到文件。劉偉聰續指，其實直至控方向他提供，他一直無收到該份文件。李運騰問區能否確認劉收到該份文件？區重申只知道戴當時有將文件發送，惟不肯定是否有送達予劉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉偉聰續問及，區指6月9日記者會前戴耀廷向組織者傳送的協調機制檔案「被視為共識」，問是誰視之為共識？區說是「戴耀廷當時視之為共識」，林卓廷等發笑。區並同意，到了第二次會議，組織者及與會者並無就此作進一步討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰指35和35公民投票為兩個概念&quot;&gt;劉偉聰指「35+」和「35+公民投票」為兩個概念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉偉聰其後指，區諾軒在證供多次提及「35+」和「35+公民投票」，兩者其實是不同的概念，前者指立會過半的政治願景，後者指2020年7月11及12日的投票，區同意「的確可以有兩個概念」。區亦同意，初選可被視為泛民主派內的比賽，爭取出線在正式選舉參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉盤問結束後，向區表示：「祝你在將來的聆訊順利。（“I wish you the best in your future proceedings.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區辦初選初心協調民主派爭立會過半組織者無有效策略爭五大訴求&quot;&gt;區辦初選初心協調民主派爭立會過半、組織者無有效策略爭五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文下午盤問區諾軒。沈先指出，區諾軒曾在盤問期間提及「初心」一詞，並指追問35+計劃的真正目標非常重要，因為這解釋了許多人在2020年3月至7月的反應及行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈其後指出，有關「35+計劃」的真正目標，有一條重要的分界線，就是該計劃僅關乎泛民在立會選舉作協調，以免浪費選票，而非關注立會過半後會做什麼，區回應「呢個係我初心」。法官陳仲衡指出，「35+」亦要求參與者認同「五大訴求」，區形容是「環境使然」，因當時正值反修例運動，五大訴求是民主派爭取的訴求，但他同意辯方指，要求認同五大訴求事實上也只是像口號或願景一樣，沒有如何達成的實質計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，本案謀劃根本的難處，在於一方面望有越多民主派參與越好，但同時參與者光譜非常廣闊，要落實達成五大訴求的計劃幾乎不可能，區同意。沈續指，因此組織者辦「35+」，純粹集中於透過協調取得立會過半。區同意此為初選「最基本的目標」，至於取得過半後如何爭取五大訴求，組織者「的確傾唔到一個有效嘅策略去應對呢個問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱與戴耀廷立場差異-區望爭民主派最大勝算戴着重運用憲制權力&quot;&gt;區稱與戴耀廷立場差異 區望爭民主派最大勝算、戴着重運用憲制權力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文問及，組織者無法達成共識，是在計劃開始前，抑或在整個35+過程發生？區諾軒指在謀劃開始前，即使是最初的飯局，「哪怕戴耀廷嗰陣已經有講佢對於否決預算案嘅睇法」，但其他與會者亦只關心如何增加民主派最大勝算；而之後接觸不同持分者，因當時有許多新晉政治人物、不知道他們想法，故協調會議上「唔同人都有唔同嘅睇法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，因此在35+計劃開始前，組織者對立會過半後如何爭取五大訴求並沒有達成共識？區回應：「起碼我同戴耀廷好清楚睇到我哋係有立場上嘅差異」，並指「我哋嘅共識就係去搞初選」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問該差異的意思，區解釋對戴耀廷來說，「一開始佢就好着重關於憲制上面點樣去運用權力」，包括否決預算案，並在文章鮮明表達；但區在整件事行進期間，「我嘅行為係說明得好清楚，我係要去做協調，我係要去爭取民主派最大勝算。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指否決預算案爭議於4月尾出現-惟同意有參與者無表態&quot;&gt;區指否決預算案爭議於4月尾出現 惟同意有參與者無表態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒同意，在籌辦初選早期，約3月至4月中，大部分參與者對否決預算案和如何落實五大訴求均不感興趣。雖然九東首次協調會議於3月2日舉行，但當時作為試點，「傾得掂初選機制，已經係難能可貴」，否決權議題「當時只係佢（戴耀廷）一個人喺度講」。直至4月尾至5月，部分協調會議出現「風向轉變」，包括4月29日第二次九西會議、及5月5日第二次新東會議，會上才就是否否決預算案作爭拗。但區同意，上述兩次會議均沒有達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續問，即使風向改變，當時是否仍有人對該議題無興趣？區同意「的確有相當人士冇興趣參與當中討論」。法官一度提及，「冇興趣」可指同意但無發聲、不同意但無發聲、或完全不感興趣，區同意，並指各參與者是「冇講嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區確認最初35文件無提否決預算案冇違反我初心&quot;&gt;區確認最初35+文件無提否決預算案、「冇違反我初心」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文其後展示「35+計劃」的文件，指「35+」的「初心」化成該文件。主控周天行一度指，區說的「初心」是指他個人的初心，並非「35+」的初心，法官李運騰表示他們理解，法官陳慶偉亦指，區辦初選的「初心」，狹義來說只是爭取民主派立會過半，與戴耀廷的「初心」不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區確認，該份文件曾向所有與會者傳閱，而他與戴耀廷發出前，均知悉及認同該內容，「佢（戴）製作呢份文件，而我都完全同意。」沈續指，文件標題「有選民參與的民主派立法會選舉協調機制」，已清晰反映「35+」目標，並問文件內容是否「反映你（區諾軒）的初心，而不是戴耀廷的初心」？區答「我能夠講冇違反我初心」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，戴在區的初心以外，還想利用立會過半來否決預算案，不過該主張沒有在「35+計劃」文件出現。沈遂問，參加者會否因此理解初選目標只是爭取立會過半？區指視乎他們接收的訊息，「你話係早期嘅訊息，又或者係呢份（「35+計劃」）文件嘅訊息，固然仍在我初心之中」，林卓廷和吳政亨等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區認無鮮明反對戴耀廷主張未立國安法的確冇為意會觸犯法例&quot;&gt;區認無鮮明反對戴耀廷主張：未立《國安法》，的確冇為意會觸犯法例&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續問，區諾軒是否一直都反對戴耀廷在「35+」的政治議程，區指「我冇認同佢理念」，但後來戴耀廷在很多記者會「不斷講關於否決權嘅講法，我亦都冇喺嗰啲時候作出鮮明嘅反對」。陳慶偉續問，那能否說區同意將否決權與35+計劃綑綁？區指「我終歸冇反對到呢樣嘢，因為當時候的確未立《國安法》，我的確冇為意到當時候呢一啲嘅主張，係會觸犯法例」，又指他亦「誤解咗」，因以他對《基本法》的理解，否決權是行使憲制上的權利。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴耀廷積極用權說法迎合不同意見予不遵行的空間&quot;&gt;區：戴耀廷「積極」用權說法迎合不同意見、予不遵行的空間&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文其後展示區諾軒錄影會面謄本，提及某次協調會議後，他曾向戴耀廷及趙家賢反映兩個政黨的意見，並指他們作為初選主事者，「冇理由唔理唔同人嘅睇法而去表達一個咁激進立場」，戴回應認為「積極運用《基本法》權力否決預算案」能給予政治團體或參與者「唔去遵行」、「唔去否決嘅空間」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒在盤問下表示，與二人會面是在5月5日的第二次新東協調會議後進行，當時民主黨、社民連、街工都有表示不同意否決預算案，會議前社民連黃浩銘亦曾着他勿答應會否決預算案。區說，「既然人哋託付我，我就要將呢個意見講畀戴耀廷聽」，並略帶激動指：「因為喺呢件事之前，佢（戴耀廷）已經不斷喺報章出文啦，甚至令我感覺到脫離咗一啲參與者嘅睇法啊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在錄影會面又解釋，戴主張「積極」一字是作為「大家討論嘅平衡點」，說法同時包含「可以不遵行否決財政預算案呢個承諾」。區確認，重申戴耀廷提「積極運用權力」的意思，是「你可以用，你可以唔用，但若果政府唔聽呢個意見，我就會行使呢個憲制權力」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，戴是以此迎合兩派陣營意見，包括望運用否決權的一方，及望保留彈性、視乎預算案內容才決定是否否決的一方，並同意戴是試圖告訴人們有空間可不運用否決權。沈士文其後指，戴耀廷沒有提及「積極」字眼是任何會議的共識，區同意「的確冇任何選區達成呢個共識」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱戴耀廷用否決權論述屬演進&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱戴耀廷用否決權論述屬「演進」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰其後就戴耀廷對否決權想法的時序發問。區同意，戴於2019年12月的文章首次提及立會過半後行使否決權，但並非很確切的說法；其後3月26日，與初選記者會同日舉行的港島區首次會議，戴提倡運用否決權但遭司馬文反對；戴其後不斷提倡在文件加入「會積極運用」權力否決預算案字眼，並鑒於其他區亦加了相關字眼，在不遲於5月4日第三次九東會議，將相關字眼加入九東文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，按此時序，會否同意運用否決權是戴耀廷持續（consistent）的主張，區指不會用 consistent 來形容，而是會用「evolvement（演進）」形容，指戴在2019年12月的文章僅提出運用憲制權力的可能性，至於談及特首下台的相關步驟，是在3月31日〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉一文才出現。不過區同意，直至他錄影會面上提及的5月5日會面，戴耀廷仍然解釋採用「積極運用權力」是作為「大家討論嘅平衡點」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;胡志偉曾稱憂政黨利用初選綑綁民主黨-惟墨落無悔後仍維持立場&quot;&gt;胡志偉曾稱憂政黨利用初選綑綁民主黨 惟「墨落無悔」後仍維持立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒曾提及，「墨落無悔」聲明發布後情況有變。沈士文就此發問，區確認「墨落無悔」發布後，黃之鋒曾主動詢問他民主黨對聲明的回應，坐在延伸庭的黃聞言與譚凱邦及馮達浚交談。區並確認，當時回覆黃3點，包括他並無與任何民主黨成員確認；預計民主黨不會同意聲明；及民主黨已表明不會無差別否決財政預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區補充，他在與黃之鋒會面前，曾與民主黨主席胡志偉會面，重申胡當時憂慮將有更多非官方聲明出現，擔心其他政黨或團體會利用初選將民主黨綑綁、令該黨受制肘；又指該黨過往立場，是對政府議案開設新的人事職位大多有保留，因為「易請難送」，但若政府要「起醫院、起學校」，無理由要否決預算案。但區同意，即使「墨落無悔」發布後民主黨被游說，但該黨依然維持上述立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方引區論文指民主黨為傳統民主派-區稱不知道黃林曾否收協調文件&quot;&gt;辯方引區論文指民主黨為傳統民主派 區稱不知道黃、林曾否收協調文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文其後提到，區諾軒曾就傳統及激進民主派的差別進行研究，該論文在今年發表，名為〈Cooperate but divided at heart: Analysis of an opposition elite survey during autocratization〉。區確認文章中，黃碧雲被歸類為傳統民主派，民主黨亦被歸類為傳統民主政黨，並指出傳統民主派比激進民主派「較親中（pro-mainland）」，民主化手法亦「較溫和（moderate）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區亦確認，黃碧雲及林卓廷2020年時為立法會議員，而二人分別從未出席九龍西及新界東的任何一次協調會議，均為其代表出席。沈士文問區是否知道戴耀廷有否將協調機制文件送達二人，區表示不知道新界東的情況，至於九龍西，戴耀廷曾告知他在首次會議後有將文件發放給與會者，惟他不知道戴實際上有否發放。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件押至下周二（14日）下午續審，沈士文表示預計當天能完成盤問。至現時為止，鄭達鴻、梁國雄、吳政亨、余慧明、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰8人已完成盤問區諾軒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">區諾軒稱楊雪盈落敗後仍參選有違35+共識、港島會議及文件無提及〈真攬炒十步〉 區諾軒：否決財案為戴耀廷「單向」介紹 從不視吳政亨為組織者 區諾軒稱辦初選「初心」與戴耀廷不同、民主黨「墨落無悔」後維持不無差別否決預算案立場</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第廿二日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-09-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-22.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第廿二日】" /><published>2023-03-09T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-03-09T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-22</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-09-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-22.html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（9日）踏入審訊第22天。辯方今就區諾軒的學術和從政背景及初選背景發問，區同意「35+」是以往民主派追求政改的延續。惟法官多番打斷提問，質疑問題與案無關，又指對香港政治運動歷史沒有興趣，籲勿將審訊當作政治平台提倡政治主張，辯方回應本案無可避免觸及政治。區又同意，五大訴求除了撤回修例和成立獨立調查委員會等5項，亦有人提出官員為警暴問責和時任特首林鄭月娥下台，解釋五大訴求概念「含糊」，各人有不同說法，組織者亦「冇清楚傾過」定義。法官陳仲衡問是否不去定義就能取悅所有人，李運騰亦問是否即如聖誕樹，想掛什麼上去都可以？引來被告大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方就區諾軒背景及立會選舉發問-官稱對政治運動歷史無興趣&quot;&gt;辯方就區諾軒背景及立會選舉發問 官稱對政治運動歷史無興趣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表吳政亨和余慧明的大律師石書銘今繼續盤問區諾軒。區在盤問下，確認他過去10年在香港民主運動有較投入的角色，他2009年、即22歲時加入民主黨，2014年前亦曾參與「左翼21」活動，形容該組織是一班有志於社會公平分配的年青人，開讀書會、關心時事和政府政策。他確認，他於中文大學修讀政治與行政學系學士和碩士，專攻比較政治和公共政策，並於東京大學修讀公共政策博士，研究亞洲全民退休保障，他亦曾於香港城市大學專上學院任客席講師。法官陳慶偉一度質疑問題不相關，惟石書銘指望就引發35+的民主運動背景發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於政治參與，區確認於2011年當選南區區議員，2012和2016年參選立法會議員，並在香港民主運動活躍，曾於2017年任民間人權陣線召集人，並曾兩度參選民主黨主席，並於2018年補選當選立法會議員，但任期只有1年9個月，其後被終審法院取消資格。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，根據其學術背景及政治參與，他對香港追求政治改革的歷程非常熟悉亦有親身參與，而「35+」計劃建立一套民主派協調機制，亦是香港漫長政改歷史的其中一章。區同意，初選協調機制是因應比例代表制的制度建立，而民主派每屆都是「多票、少議席」。石書銘續問，對泛民主派來說，要求普選是否有《基本法》的基礎，惟法官李運騰質疑，區能否代其他人回答，法官陳慶偉亦提醒石只是代表吳政亨和余慧明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘表示明白，惟欲就初選的脈絡發問。陳慶偉指，「我們對香港的政治運動歷史沒有興趣，我們只對本案控罪有興趣。（“We are not interested in the political history movement in Hong Kong, we are only interested in the charge.”）」石指控罪只能在政治的背景下理解，陳慶偉指他明白，「我們不需要你教」，李運騰亦指石書銘的問題在主問已觸及，可直接問其他問題。石書銘指尚有許多細節未觸及，望能提供一個完整的圖畫，惟陳慶偉再着石直接發問，又指法庭不需區諾軒就香港的政治改革講課（“We don’t need a lecture from him on political reform in Hong Kong.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒同意35是政改延續-官再打斷發問指不應倡政治主張&quot;&gt;區諾軒同意35+是政改延續 官再打斷發問指不應倡政治主張&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘續問，35+是否以往民主派追求政治改革的延續，區同意。石再問，直至2019年，民主派陣營是否已對政改進程感到挫敗，法官李運騰再打斷，指區只能代表自己說話，法官陳慶偉亦着石「不要利用法律程序作為政治平台（“Do not use this proceeding as a political platform.”）」。石遂改問區曾否與其他團體討論，惟陳慶偉再指問題太空泛。石書銘重申，本案核心無可避免觸及政治議題（“The crux of the matter in this case inevitably touches on political issues.”），他不是要以此作為政治平台。陳慶偉表示明白，但指其盤問有限度，重申不應以此為平台提倡任何政治主張，並駁回其問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘指他並非提倡任何政治主張，並改問為何區諾軒及戴耀廷等組織者推動35+。惟陳慶偉再指區已在主問答過該問題，即望為民主派建立協調機制。石再問有否其他原因，惟陳慶偉打斷着他問下一條問題。李運騰指石如想提出其他原因可以指出，石回應想問開放式問題，惟陳慶偉不准他繼續發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒同意五大訴求概念含糊-組織者冇清楚傾過定義&quot;&gt;區諾軒同意五大訴求概念「含糊」 組織者「冇清楚傾過」定義&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒其後在盤問下，同意35+的性質是要爭取立會過半，向政府問責並要求政府回應公眾訴求，而以上兩項都是當時社會所缺乏的。他亦認為，當時初選組織者和參與者都有過相關看法，並主動提及他2020年4月30日在《蘋果日報》的訪問，指當時有兩種聲音，一邊是支持攬炒和否決財政預算案；另一邊是要爭取立法會過半，以增加談判空間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就區在訪問提到藉35+爭「五大訴求」，石書銘指五大訴求是否即「撤回《逃犯條例》修訂」、「成立獨立調查委員會」、「撤回暴動定性」、「特赦被捕者」及「爭取雙普選」，區同意，並指尚有另外兩點，包括「相關政府官員為警暴負責」，及「林鄭月娥下台」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，是否即除了五大訴求，還有另外的訴求，區指這是當時他聽到的訴求，並同意法官陳慶偉指，五大訴求的概念「的確係含糊嘅」，「因為呢啲訴求有時有，有時冇。」李運騰指他不太明白，問五大訴求其實是否有多於五個訴求？此時施德來點頭，陳志全亦發笑。區否認，指當時社會輿論的確不斷講五大訴求，「至於係邊五個，唔同人有唔同講法」，林卓廷亦邊笑邊點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，「五大訴求」是35+目標，初選組織者曾否定義五大訴求，區指「的確冇清楚傾過，但係喺嗰七樣嘢裡面」，並同意李運騰指，「五大訴求」是像「口號」一樣。陳仲衡續問，是否若不具體定義何謂「五大訴求」，便可取悅所有想要「五大訴求」的人，區確認「當時嘅公眾討論的確係咁嘅情況」。李運騰又形容，是否即如聖誕樹，想掛什麼上去都可以？此時被告大笑，區並稱「都離唔開呢七條樹枝」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒其後在石書銘盤問下，同意林鄭月娥下台與爭取雙普選兩訴求有較多「可取代性」；而要求政府官員為警暴負責亦與要求獨立調查委員會查警暴相似，兩者實是「五大訴求」的另一種演繹方式。石書銘其後欲再問，35+計劃如何落實區提及的目標，惟再被陳慶偉要求問下一條問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官稱對辯方盤問感困惑-提醒應與案相關&quot;&gt;官稱對辯方盤問感困惑 提醒應與案相關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;小休後，法官陳仲衡表示對石書銘的盤問感到困惑（puzzled），法官李運騰指，看不到辯方問題與控罪或余慧明角色的相關性，又指若石書銘不作解釋，難以容許他繼續發問。石書銘指控罪與被告取得立會過半的「非法手段」相關，惟李運騰強調，控方案情不僅談及取得立會過半，而是指被告串謀目標是「無差別」否決預算案。石書銘指，故希望理解初選組織者的看法和如何理解否決預算案，惟李運騰提醒，他只是代表吳政亨和余慧明，而吳並沒有盤問，着他只集中在自己的當事人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰又指，若石書銘認為35+計劃不違法，則應向證人指出，又指石是在兜圈，並非處理35+的合法性問題，望他能善用法庭時間。法官陳慶偉其後問，石在結案陳詞希望有什麼陳述，石回應望指出整個「攬炒」的概念並非控方所指的「非法手段」及可「顛覆國家政權」。李運騰質疑證人是否可回答相關問題，陳慶偉亦多次問石期望證人回答什麼，石指望區回答就舉辦初選的想法，以說出初選的脈絡（context），惟陳慶偉指該說法太過空泛（hollow）。石解釋，望證人就初選的合法性作供，法官重申問題必須相關和集中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KiqgAHb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（9日）踏入審訊第22天。區諾軒續接受盤問，表示認為《基本法》精神是政府和立法會「互諒互讓」，他亦曾期望立會透過談判與政府解決反修例風波；並將「攬炒」一派歸結為「不斷透過施壓要求政府妥協」，意指「你唔合作，我都唔合作囉」。辯方問及，抗爭派曾否表示若政府回應五大訴求，便不會否決預算案，區表示無相關資訊，又指除非與被告有私交，否則「我唔係一個適當嘅角色去評論人（立場）」。辯方再問激進陣營是否以否決權作籌碼，區指政治人物通常都會實行所說的事，「不過當然都有啲政治人物話，『我講吓咋喎』」，法官和被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指基本法精神是政府與立會互諒互讓-曾期望透過談判解決反修例風波&quot;&gt;區指《基本法》精神是政府與立會「互諒互讓」 曾期望透過談判解決反修例風波&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表吳政亨和余慧明的大律師石書銘今繼續盤問區諾軒。石書銘就戴耀廷2019年12月的〈立會奪半，走向真普選重要一步〉一文發問，提及「立會奪半若能成功，最重要的不是能直接改變香港制度的本質，而是令立法會轉變為一個守護香港核心價值的重要堡壘」，問區諾軒作為初選組織者，當時是否抱持同樣看法，區指「我的確認同過呢篇文章，所以先開始同戴耀廷合作」。石問區為何認同，惟法官陳慶偉指與案無關，石解釋與本案串謀的目標相關，惟遭陳打斷並着他問下一條問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘其後引文中提及，「立法會最強大的力量是財政權 ⋯⋯ 因此，民主派在立法會奪半，應可運用立法會的財政權，迫使特區政權在運用公共資源上考慮公民的真正需要。」區同意戴耀廷於2020年1月的飯局提及該觀點。石其後就立法會議員向政府議案提出修訂的權力發問，惟再遭法官陳慶偉多番打斷指不相關。區其後確認，議員提出私人條例草案需要政府同意，議員亦不能對財政預算案提出修訂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒曾受訪指，當時對35+有兩種想像，分別是支持攬炒和否決財政預算案，及爭取立會過半以增加談判空間。石書銘續問，立會過半是否讓議員可增加與政府談判的空間，讓政府回應民生議題？區解釋，《基本法》第49至52條詳細談及關於立法會與政府處理財政預算案的機制，他一直對條文的解讀，是「當中嘅精神，其實就係政府同立法會大家，互相互諒互讓」，並在出現分歧時透過談判處理。區並舉例他任立法會議員時，曾就預算案與施政報告等與特首或財政司司長會面，形容「一個良好嘅政治制度，應該要做到呢一點」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，若沿着該談判空間的思路發展下去，「我的確曾經期望過，新選出嚟嘅立法會，會同政府一齊透過談判解決反修例風波。」惟區亦指出，「攬炒論嗰一派係另一種睇法，我會歸結為不斷透過施壓，要求政府妥協。」他並指，該兩種看法，在多年民主運動亦有出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問向政府施壓是否仍有討論空間-區舉人力社民連例子稱視乎情況&quot;&gt;辯方問向政府施壓是否仍有討論空間 區舉人力社民連例子稱視乎情況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘續指，無論談判或施壓其實都是一體兩面，法官陳慶偉着他留待陳詞再述，又指「我知道你不喜歡這個答案」，惟石回應他其實喜歡該答案。石續問，區提及有陣營不斷施壓要求政府妥協，但是否仍有討論空間？區舉例，以往人民力量和社民連均被歸類為較激進的政團，並在政府是否派錢的議題上以拉布爭取訴求，對施政構成影響，惟其後政府決定直接派錢予市民後，他們亦決定停止拉布，「所以一切都係要睇情況而定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問及，直至初選論壇，是否仍然有該兩個陣營存在，區指「相信總有候選人係可以歸類喺兩個陣營裡面嘅」，但認為仍要視乎他們當時言行，才會有較公允評價。石書銘續問，那對較激進陣營來說，若政府回應五大訴求，是否便不必然否決預算案。控方質疑問題屬揣測、區無法回答，法官陳仲衡亦指論壇上沒有相關言論，其問題充滿假設性，陳慶偉亦重申「籠統的問題只會換來籠統的答案」，亦沒有證案價值。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指認為並非適當角色評論被告立場&quot;&gt;區諾軒指認為並非適當角色評論被告立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，區諾軒其實已回答了石的問題，即視乎各人言行。區同意，並指「呢幾日因為⋯⋯我相信嚟緊都會有唔少嘅辯方律師，會問我佢哋嘅當事人究竟係咪持守某個立場，我越諗越覺得，我唔係一個適當嘅角色去評論人，除非我同佢有私交，而可以提供到佢嘅諗法畀法庭」，何桂藍一度露齒笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘再問，以區觀察，是否同意有激進陣營的參與者以否決權作為籌碼，區答：「政治人物通常都係講乜嘢就實行啲乜嘢，不過當然都有啲政治人物話，『我講吓咋喎』，所以呢個問題真係好難答」，法官陳慶偉隨即發笑，多名被告包括鄭達鴻、林卓廷、余慧明和鄒家成等也忍俊不禁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問有否抗爭派稱若回應五大訴求就不否決財案-區稱無相關資訊&quot;&gt;辯方問有否抗爭派稱若回應五大訴求就不否決財案 區稱無相關資訊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘再問，區曾否聽過激進陣營表示若政府回應五大訴求，他們或不會否決預算案，區指「始終係未發生嘅事」，又指「若果有人真係咁講，我哋就要相信囉」。法官陳仲衡補充，據庭上播放的片段，曾否有任何抗爭派人士表達過相關看法，區指看不到相關片段，「好難話呢個可能出嚟」，又指「我嘅難處的確係，當事人冇特別咁講，佢又冇同我私交」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問及，那區在不公開的協調會議曾否聽過抗爭派人士有相關說法，區則重申，雖然戴耀廷有提及「會積極運用」等字眼，但3至4月的氛圍尚未去到討論是否否決預算案，並指「的確冇人係喺嗰個時候特登講話如果政府做啲乜，我就唔用（否決權）啦。」李運騰再問，那在其他任何場合，區有否聽過任何抗爭派人士提過相關說法，區再稱「我真係冇相關嘅資訊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱攬炒意思為你唔合作我都唔合作囉&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱「攬炒」意思為「你唔合作，我都唔合作囉」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘其後就「攬炒」發問，區同意「攬炒」意思為雙方互不讓步，導致雙方有損失。石其後引述2020年《立場》的戴耀廷訪問〈【選舉近了】面對 35+ 憧憬與「囚徒困境」 民主派有可能協調嗎？〉，提及2016年立法會選舉民主派名單數目創新高，卻導致「攬炒」局面：「前車可鑑，有沒可能避免因『囚徒困境』引致的『攬炒』結局？戴耀廷的構思，是辦一個『有公民參與的協調機制』⋯⋯」石指「攬炒」一詞亦用來形容2016年選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，上文「攬炒」涉及對象是民主派之間，問區〈真攬炒十步〉一文所涉對象為誰，區指是政府與民主派之間。陳續指「攬炒」的意思要視乎脈絡，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石續問，「攬炒」是否視乎雙方的互動，一方作出行為，另一方再回應。區解釋，「囚徒困境」中雙方合作能得益，「如果大家都唔合作，就係一種攬炒」，理解「攬炒」意思為「你唔合作，我都唔合作囉」。區並認為，35+中部分民主派若高舉「攬炒」，會解讀其動機是指「你唔合作，我都唔合作囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘一度再問，若指戴耀廷4月文章提及「攬炒」，是指若政府不回應五大訴求，泛民才拒絕合作，該說法是否公道，法官陳慶偉指他應問戴耀廷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（9日）踏入審訊第22天。區諾軒繼續接受盤問，法官李運騰臨散庭前表示，對本案進度非常關注，指他於9月底需處理另一宗案件，惟本案自開審後24天，仍在處理首名控方證人的盤問。大部分辯方律師均認為，原定的90天足夠完成雙方案情，自辯的劉偉聰亦指感到樂觀，指他自被捕後每天也樂觀地生活，其中鄒家成、施德來、黃碧雲和林卓廷擬作供。法官陳慶偉指，若計及相關法律爭議、求情和裁決等，料審訊或需延至聖誕節。翻查資料，黎智英及《蘋果日報》3間公司涉勾結外國勢力案定於9月底開審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官關注審訊進度-指同意事實除首5段外均需舉證&quot;&gt;法官關注審訊進度 指同意事實除首5段外均需舉證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今繼續接受盤問，臨散庭前，法官就案件進度與雙方商討。法官李運騰表示，對案件進度感到非常關注，指現時已是審訊第20多天，惟仍在處理首名控方證人，並只是第二名辯方律師進行盤問。他並指，他9月底有另一宗案件要處理，今早亦推遲了一宗原定8月開審的謀殺案，並向律師索取未來兩年日程，因他不認為本案能於8月初完成（“I see no prospect of this case finishing in early August.”）。翻查資料，壹傳媒創辦人黎智英與《蘋果日報》3間公司被控「串謀勾結外國勢力」等罪，原定今年9月25日開審，李運騰為該案主審法官之一，本案主控周天行亦為該案主控。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰要求控方估計審訊需時多久，周天行指，現時尚餘3名被告證人，至於其餘為程序而需要傳召的證人（formal witness），則視乎雙方同意的事實。控辯雙方早前讀出4份同意事實，當中黃碧雲、林卓廷和何桂藍同意的部分較少。李運騰指陳仲衡製作了比較列表，除了頭5段，幾乎其餘的段落均需控方舉證。法官陳慶偉指尚有逾100名證人，被告席傳來「吓」，控方確認名單上有100名證人，但希望其他證人證供能「相對上」較短。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，「相對」是一個相對的概念，李運騰亦笑指，一百年「相對上」較一千年為短，控方說法對法庭無甚幫助，問控方有否較實際的估計。陳慶偉指控方不可能有「實際的估計」，只能有「大概的估計（guesstimate）」，又問能否於聖誕前完成審訊，被告發笑。李運騰並指，法庭的底線是不希望押後續審（part heard），周天行回應，認為審訊能於8月前完成。李運騰其後指辯方或有更好的估算，並逐一問辯方的看法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施德來黃碧雲林卓廷及鄒家成或作供&quot;&gt;施德來、黃碧雲、林卓廷及鄒家成或作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大部分辯方律師認為90日足夠雙方案情。代表吳政亨和余慧明的大律師石書銘指，就區諾軒的盤問只餘下5至10分鐘，盤問其他證人需2至3天，亦不預計會傳召辯方證人。代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀指，盤問區諾軒會於1小時完成；代表何啟明的大律師阮偉明亦指，就區諾軒的盤問會很簡短，亦不會傳召辯方證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表施德來的大律師黃廷光指，認為90日審期足夠，而施德來或會作供及傳召一名辯方證人，預計需時3日；代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文則指，區諾軒的證供是3名被告證人中最長，其餘的會較短，認為90日足夠，而黃林二人或會作供，料需時3日。代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑則指，鄒或會作供，但無法估計控方案情需時多久，因現時還在接收新的材料。代表柯耀林的大律師葉海琅指，或會傳召一至兩名證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉，及代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大律師黃宇逸，均認為90日足夠，黃宇逸並指盤問區諾軒只用了1.5天，預計其他證人會更短。自辯的劉偉聰則表示，「我感到樂觀，這也是我被捕後度過每天的方法（“I am optimistic, that’s how I live everyday since my arrest.”）」，認為90日足夠處理整宗案件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指計算裁決求情等-案件或於聖誕才能完成&quot;&gt;官指計算裁決求情等 案件或於聖誕才能完成&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過亦有辯方認為90日不足夠。代表楊雪盈的大律師張耀良認為控方過於樂觀，料在90日審期外尚需多20至30日，而他需時少於1小時盤問區諾軒。代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 指，會就「共謀者原則」作爭議，亦可能作中段陳詞，認為在90日審期外或需多10日進行法律爭議。代表李予信的大律師關文渭則指，預計會審至9月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰最後苦笑指，雙方似乎只認為90日只足夠完成雙方案情，惟他與主控周天行均須處理9月的案件，若屆時本案審訊未完，將會面對重大困難，又指不是希望責怪任何人，但望雙方均做好準備。法官陳慶偉則指，要處理所有證據、法律爭議、結案陳詞、求情及裁決等，案件或需延至聖誕才能完成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明天續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">辯方就區諾軒背景及民主運動提問 官多番打斷質疑無關、稱對政治運動歷史無興趣 辯方問政府若讓步抗爭派是否不一定否決財案 區：我唔係適當嘅角色評論 官關注審訊進度、料審至聖誕 鄒家成、林卓廷等4人擬作供</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
