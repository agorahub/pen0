On this matter, the work of the UN Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination, has been of significant importance (hereinafter, UN WG on Mercenaries) Additionally, the UN Human Rights Council has consistently emphasized the need to strengthen oversight mechanisms to address these evolving challenges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This contribution elaborates on three specific trends that appear insufficiently prioritized in current regulatory discussions, highlights existing regulatory gaps and challenges, and calls for urgent regulatory attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maritime-security&quot;&gt;Maritime Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the emerging trends in private military and security operations posing significant challenges to existing regulatory frameworks governing Private Military and Security Companies (PMSCs) concerns maritime security. The UN increasingly identifies maritime security as integral to international peace and legal order, as evolving threats expose growing regulatory gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PMSCs have played a central role in responding to piracy and terrorism targeting commercial shipping and maritime trade routes, shifting their operations from traditional land-based activities towards increasingly complex roles in international waters. Protection provided by PMSCs not only reduces the risk of piracy attacks on contracted vessels but also lowers the likelihood of attacks on nearby vessels by approximately 7%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, with significant downsizing of the industry, a consequence of reduced high-risk areas, regulatory problems observed are related to regulation of the floating armories (FAs). While the UN Working Group on Mercenaries addressed a number of regulatory challenges related to use and operations of maritime PMSCs (2022), operations of the floating armories continue to raise concerns. Recent incidents of sinking vessels used as FAs close to conflict areas, without international oversight of transfer/management of stockpiles on them, raise further concerns about their regulation. While the International Maritime Organization does not have specific regulatory framework guiding operations of FAs, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) addresses criminal jurisdiction on board of a foreign ship, which is quite limited in relation to territorial waters, and shifts responsibility mainly to regulate activities and operations of FAs to Flag states. As Flag States do not have (in general mode) particular oversight mechanisms of FAs, nor do they perform their audits, there is a clear gap in oversight of the global operations of FAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, considering oversight of weapons and operations of maritime Private Security Companies (PSCs), there are concerns that even though some Flag States have quite a comprehensive regulatory framework regarding registration and certification of maritime PSCs, they often lack oversight capabilities, and depend on documented reports only. For instance, inspections of vessels using PSCs staff, to verify if arms are properly stored, if they are operational, or living/working conditions of the staff operating on vessels, are not a common procedure. Additionally, concerns over PSCs employees’ rights relate to difficulty reporting potential abuse, lack of payment or poor working conditions incompatible with Flag State national laws. This is a consequence of widespread hiring by maritime PSCs across the globe, including in less developed countries, unaware of their rights under Flag States national law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these constraints are becoming more important in a context where PMSCs are increasingly recognized as critical non-state actors in maritime security, and questions arise regarding their de facto substitution of state responsibilities in this domain as well as lack of international regulatory mechanisms responsible for global oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;weapons-procurement-and-transfers&quot;&gt;Weapons Procurement and Transfers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second emerging issue concerns the role of PMSCs in arms procurement and transfer activities. The arms trade network has changed and PMSCs possess an increasing capacity to procure arms and facilitate weapons transfers to states and non-state clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many states have legal, regulatory, and contractual provisions in place regarding PMSCs involvement in the “sub-delegation” of the acquisition of arms and weapons that follows tracing, recording, and “end-certification” processes, some do not. PMSCs involvement in arms procurement risks undermining existing arms control regimes and oversight mechanisms, the majority of which are State-focused, as well as falling outside of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instruments such as the Firearms Protocol, Arms Trade Treaty, and the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons do not recognize the possibility of PMSCs engaging in weapons transfers. Similarly, the Montreux Document “best practices” and the ICoCA “Code of Conduct” – neither of which legally binding instruments – place the responsibility of arms acquisition and transfer on contracting, home and territorial states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conflict and/or weak governance settings, PMSCs have engaged in acquisitions and transfers on behalf of States that do not follow established procedures of registration and end-user certification. This entails the use of brokers, intermediaries, and the fabrication of documentation. PMSCs have also acquired weapons via state “re-routing” (i.e. the diversion of a legal state-state transfer, that is re-routed onto the PMSC for use, sale, transfer). This complicates the traceability, end-user verification process, and control over arms transfers. These practices have been flagged as creating heightened risks of diversion to sanctioned armed groups, in violation of UN Security Council arms embargoes.Of particular concern is the growing nexus between PMSCs and “grey and black markets, networks and financing”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging technologies, such as uncrewed aerial systems and 3D printed weapons “ghost guns”, represent a new frontier not only in weapons development and manufacturing, but also in the expanding operational capabilities and commercial activities of PMSCs. PMSCs have been connected to the supply and sale of such additive components as a means of self-funding, raising concerns about PMCSs connections to illicit networks, their ability to raise illicit funds, and the circulation of unmarked, unverified weapon components and technologies. Moreover, the increasing availability of dual-use technologies — applicable for both civilian and military purposes — further complicates oversight, blurring the line between legitimate trade and unauthorized proliferation, and challenging existing export control regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PMSCs are also increasingly engaged in utilizing digital tools and cyber-technologies for surveillance, intelligence gathering, operational planning and targeting in conflict and non-conflict situations. This growing reliance on cyber-enabled services is likely to persist and expand, yet currently unfolds within a largely unregulated international legal framework. In some cases, PMSCs have even been implicated in the development and operation of offensive cyber capabilities, raising significant concerns under international law governing cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;predatory-recruitment-practices&quot;&gt;Predatory Recruitment Practices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another emerging trend concerns the growing prevalence of exploitative or predatory recruitment practices. The involvement of PMSCs in conflict, post-conflict, and proxy war contexts has intensified recruitment efforts, facilitated by globalized labor markets. While recruitment often adheres to national and international standards, there is increasing evidence that PMSCs exploit vulnerabilities among prospective recruits, leading to abusive and coercive labor practices, in violation of applicable human rights obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Global South has become a key labor pool for PMSCs, exacerbating existing inequalities based on citizenship, socioeconomic status, gender, social class, and race. These disparities render PMSC personnel particularly vulnerable to exploitation and labor rights violations. This practice became even more evident in the aftermath of COVID-19, as migration of individuals seeking better employment opportunities in other countries increased; and also among prisoners, in many cases serving sentences in states different from their own nationalities, where they are offered amnesty or pardon deals in exchange for enlisting in PMSCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recruitment is often conducted through internal databases, digital platforms, and targeted branding campaigns using provocative messaging and promises of lucrative compensation to attract highly specialized freelance personnel. However, emerging reports document instances where promised benefits are not delivered, where fraud and coercion occur, and where these practices amount to violations of international human rights norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concluding-remarks&quot;&gt;Concluding Remarks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid diversification of PMSC activities underscores the urgent need for the international community to confront not only the traditional challenges associated with the outsourcing of military and security functions, but also the increasingly complex regulatory gaps emerging in new operational domains. These developments reveal a clear trend: PMSCs are no longer confined to conventional combat support or logistical roles but are extending into areas that directly affect the rights and safety of civilians, the integrity of international legal regimes, and the sovereign functions of States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulatory vacuum that persists across multiple domains –including maritime security, arms transfers, and labor practices–, poses serious threats to international human rights and international humanitarian law. This vacuum reflects not only regulatory gaps, but an erosion of the state’s monopoly on legitimate force, challenging attribution, effective control, and state responsibility. Without clear, enforceable international standards, PMSCs may continue to operate in legal grey zones, shielded from effective accountability mechanisms while exercising functions that often approach, or even replace, core State responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the work of the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group on PMSCs takes on renewed urgency. A robust, legally binding international instrument is indispensable to establish clear obligations for States, to regulate the transnational operations of PMSCs, particularly in emerging, hybrid, non-traditional domains, so as to ensure human rights abuses are prevented, and provide adequate access and remedy to justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effective regulation of PMSCs is not merely a technical legal challenge; it is a matter of upholding the foundational principles of international law, protecting human dignity, and preserving the accountability architecture upon which global peace and security depend. The current moment presents a critical opportunity for States, international organizations, and civil society to forge a comprehensive, future-proof regulatory framework that meets the evolving challenges of private military and security governance.&lt;/p&gt;

Would there be survivors? Would your iPhone work? This briefing dispels common misconceptions about high-altitude nuclear explosions and summarizes the current state of research on the subject.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, no party has used nuclear weapons in war since 1945. Treaties limiting nuclear tests and weapon inventories during the Cold War highlighted the pragmatism of world leaders. As memories fade, and nascent nuclear states mature, the potential for their use (or misuse) rises. In a strategic environment with multiple nuclear-armed states of various sizes and incentives, it is important to understand the science underlying the use of nuclear weapons in novel and unexpected ways. As opposed to the ground bursts of World War II, their use in the sky has potential to achieve certain objectives without catastrophic loss of life. Due partly to the lack of testing and partly to a somber reluctance to consider this potentiality, many misunderstandings persist. There is a need to address prevailing myths about the use of high-altitude nuclear explosions and provide realities rooted in the existing research on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waging war against an enemy with dominant digital communications systems is a recipe for defeat. Modern digital communications structures enable lethal kill-chain targeting cycles, seamless command and control, and precision guidance that dominate the enemy. This reality makes the space and cyber domains a primary target in future warfare. All tacticians seek to degrade their adversaries’ communications in war, but few consider the literal “nuclear option” that could fundamentally upend the current communications ecosystem. High-altitude nuclear explosions (HANEs) allow an actor to degrade modern communications, either on the ground or in the sky. Closer to the ground, HANEs create a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) that could shut down power plants, cellular towers, and electronic devices. Higher in the sky, HANEs produce radiation that can damage or destroy satellites. If a state actor (or rogue element) decides that access to digital systems or the space domain is giving its adversary an unfair edge, it might decide to use a HANE to negate this advantage without directly killing a single human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The norm against using nuclear weapons endured for decades, but recent saber-rattling and proliferation trends suggest this restraint is fragile. Would adversaries consider launching a HANE attack that destroys and degrades electronics without direct loss of human life? Would such an attack be perceived as a breach of the international taboo on nuclear weapons use? This paper examines existing research on HANE effects to dispel misconceptions and clarify the potential consequences of such a scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hane-effects-101&quot;&gt;HANE Effects 101&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A HANE is a nuclear detonation above 30 kilometers (19 miles), where the density of air is low enough that energy from the nuclear weapon interacts with its surroundings in a markedly different manner than a “mushroom cloud” of a detonation nearer to the ground. These detonations create damage to electronics within the Earth’s atmosphere through their production of HEMPs. E1, the most damaging HEMP mechanism created by HANEs, results because the air density is extremely low around the explosion, unlike at lower altitudes. Therefore, electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances in a downward direction before interacting with air molecules (Figure 1). Many of these interactions result in ionization, or the freeing of electrons, which cause a burst of electromagnetic energy as they are deflected by the Earth’s magnetic field. This burst of energy, or EMP, occurs over a large area, where it causes damage and disruption to electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/268Z0IJ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Creation of the E1 Field of a HEMP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HANEs can damage or destroy satellites through two primary mechanisms. First, high levels of prompt radiation from gamma rays, X-rays, and neutrons can travel relatively unimpeded directly to satellites due to the low density of the atmosphere (Figure 2). This is limited to satellites within line of sight (LOS) of the HANE, with the Earth shielding many others. The amount of prompt radiation, or dose, that a satellite receives increases with increasing yield and decreases proportional to the square of the distance from the explosion. Second, free electrons resulting from an explosion can become trapped in artificial radiation belts due to the Earth’s magnetic field, creating a hostile environment for satellites passing through. These electrons can be trapped for years and may drastically decrease the lifespans of satellites orbiting through them, even if they were initially outside of the HANE’s LOS. Additionally, this radiation belt presents challenges in reconstituting space with new satellites due to the lasting effects. For example, a new satellite designed to last two years may only last a couple of months due to the new trapped radiation. Shielding and radiation hardening can significantly increase the amount of radiation dose required for damage from both of these mechanisms; however, it is not practical to completely shield from the prompt effects of a HANE of sufficient yield and proximity. Additionally, shielding to the level required to protect against HANE effects is generally only seen in military satellites because it is currently cost-prohibitive for commercial applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AtIxi0J.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-ground-or-both&quot;&gt;Space, Ground, or Both&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altitude is the key factor determining whether the most significant effects of a HANE are experienced on the ground or on satellites. An explosion at a height of 30 kilometers (19 miles) would create an appreciable, though not maximal, EMP and have minimal effects on satellites. Satellites in this scenario are largely unscathed due to the attenuation of prompt radiation in the Earth’s atmosphere and further distance from low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Peak HEMP E1 occurs close to 75 kilometers (47 miles) above the surface and starts to drop off considerably after 100 kilometers (62 miles), as shown in Figure 3. While the strength of the HEMP decreases considerably above this height, the ground area affected increases (Figure 4). Higher altitude HANEs, such as the previous U.S. test Starfish Prime at 300 kilometers (186 miles), affect a larger area but have a much weaker associated HEMP. These higher explosions will also have significantly greater impacts on satellites due to a lack of attenuation in the atmosphere, their closer proximity to many satellites in orbit, and the increasing field of view of satellites at risk with increasing altitude (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;myth-1-no-one-would-use-a-nuclear-weapon-even-at-high-altitude&quot;&gt;Myth #1: No One Would Use a Nuclear Weapon (Even at High Altitude)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The constraint against nuclear explosions held true for over 70 years and made sense when the costs of international repercussions outweighed the benefits from use. For decades, the structuralism of the global order constrained adversaries. Post–World War II geopolitics rarely degenerated into great power combat because it was not in any nation’s interest to do so. Structures such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization provided forums where countries could achieve political objectives without resorting to violence. In 1963, the United States, Soviet Union, and United Kingdom signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT), which prohibits nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere, outer space, and underwater. After the Cold War, globalism guaranteed collective gains for states willing to abide by international norms. Thomas Friedman described a “Golden Straitjacket” that offers nations wealth and progress if they abide by the rules and norms of the international order. Multiple indicators—from the Russian invasion of sovereign European territory and threats of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine to the United States stepping back from international bodies—suggest this era is nearing its end, and nations should prepare for the dynamics of a post-globalism era. It is impossible to predict when a pariah state will finally decide that its national interests are better served by destroying the tools the rest of the world depends upon. However, the reasons for their restraint appear to be decreasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use could be precise or haphazard. A rational state actor would wait until the optimum time to use latent capabilities to uproot the world order. While one state could use a bevy of tools, such as cyberattacks and anti-satellite weapons, to temporarily disrupt satellite and internet access without permanent destruction, another state actor may consider the large, destructive effects a single HANE offers. And while the leaders of each of these nations have thus far restrained themselves, there is the possibility that a coup or uprising could result in more unpredictable leadership that would use available tools in unpredictable ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War, the space domain remains accessible to all sides, allowing advanced communications, weapons guidance, drone operations, and data integration. This semi-permissive access is not guaranteed in future warfare. Russia and its precursor, the Soviet Union, have a history of surprising scientific breakthroughs that upend geopolitics. In 1957, the Soviet Union shocked the world with the launch of Sputnik, the first artificial Earth satellite. In 2021, Russia destroyed one of its own satellites with an antisatellite missile, foreshadowing a future threat to the United States’ vast orbital communication infrastructure. In 2024, after withdrawing from multiple arms control agreements, Russia launched a satellite in orbit that could employ a nuclear weapon. U.S. Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy Vipin Narang stated that the prospect of this space weapon poses “a threat to satellites operated by countries and companies around the globe, as well as to the vital communications, scientific, meteorological, agricultural, commercial, and national security services upon which we all depend.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is also actively studying the effects of space-based nuclear weapons. The Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology (NINT), a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) research and development institute, published a paper detailing the effects of a space-based nuclear weapon on LEO satellites like the Starlink network. Another NINT paper noted, “A combination of soft and hard kill methods should be adopted to make some Starlink satellites lose their functions and destroy the constellation’s operating system.” From the figures in that paper, one can identify optimal altitudes for various military effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;myth-2-hemps-will-disable-everything-electronic&quot;&gt;Myth #2: HEMPs Will Disable Everything Electronic&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Call of Duty franchise offers HEMPs as an option during battle. When a player uses one, it disables all the opponent’s command and control capabilities, such as their map, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assets, and even their electronic weapon sights for a fixed period. While Call of Duty brings attention to the topic of HEMPs to a wider audience, it misrepresents them in many ways. First, the in-game EMP consistently shuts down everything electronic. In reality, HEMPs create stochastic effects—which have a probability pattern that can be analyzed statistically, not predicted precisely. For example, one device could be destroyed, while an identical one meters away is spared due to having a slightly different orientation. Additionally, the HEMP effects from Call of Duty are transient, lasting under a minute, but would actually be varied over time. Many electrical components would be instantaneously and permanently damaged and never come back online, while others would be only temporarily disrupted. The misrepresentation of EMP effects seen in Call of Duty is not unique. Similar themes are seen in movies such as The Matrix, GoldenEye, and Ocean’s Eleven. The general public often overestimates the effects of a HEMP since these examples are often their only exposure to this subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of a HEMP on devices depend on the intensity of the EMP field, the orientation of the device with respect to that field, the inherent shielding of the device, and the sensitivity of the device’s microelectronics. The amount of energy collected depends on several factors, including its size and orientation to the pulse. Long cables, antennas, and railroad tracks would be able to collect a significant amount of energy that could damage large systems, such as large power transformers. While devices such as cellphones are small collectors, some components, such as semiconductor diodes and transistors, may be more sensitive to pulses from a HEMP. Three people standing next to each other with three different phones could have three different outcomes. One’s circuits may be relatively undamaged, with the owner noticing no internal disruption, while a second has issues that resolve after a restart, and a third person’s phone loses functionality critical to operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While two of the phones in this example are not destroyed, much of their functionality may be unavailable due to the modern, interconnected network of systems required. Gamma rays and X-rays can ionize atoms in the atmosphere, which can disrupt radiofrequency waves passing through them for anywhere from seconds to hours, depending on the frequency. Communications infrastructure, such as cell towers, may be inoperable due to damage from a HEMP, which could also disrupt the electrical power generation required to operate communications infrastructure. Finally, communications satellites at low Earth orbit—less than 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles)—may also be disrupted or destroyed depending on the altitude of the HANE creating the HEMP. This is the orbital region most affected by HANEs and is advantageous for many communications satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to pinpoint the exact damage that could come from a HEMP due to the complex mechanisms and limited test data. It is important for decisionmakers to understand that there will be significant disruption and damage to electrical devices, but that it will not be ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;myth-3-a-hane-harms-the-user-as-much-as-the-target&quot;&gt;Myth #3: A HANE Harms the User as Much as the Target&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HANEs have the capability to harm their user through both effects on their satellites and HEMP effects within the Earth’s atmosphere. Regarding the former, a common supposition exists that it would not make sense for a state to use a HANE in space because it would damage or destroy its own satellites as well. First, this assumes that all states are as reliant on satellites as the United States. Many nuclear-armed states are not. The United States is currently dominant in the satellite sector and has made multiple decisions and investments to maintain its strategic advantages in this domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, states can employ HANEs in ways that limit the amount of damage to their own satellites. For example, an actor could choose to detonate a HANE that optimizes damaging enemy satellites while minimizing collateral damage to its own based on satellite locations at the planned time and location of the detonation. However, given that there are thousands of satellites deployed in LEO—and that the prompt radiation field of view (as shown in Figure 2) means a HANE could affect up to 20 percent of LEO satellites—it is impossible for most states to avoid destroying a portion of their own satellites and causing significant damage to those of their allies and commercial entities. Additionally, trapped electrons could still affect many satellites that had been shielded from the HANE by the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To minimize space effects, a state could pursue a lower-altitude HANE, such as at around 30 kilometers (19 miles), to primarily target HEMP effects within the Earth’s atmosphere. If employed over the battlefield, HEMP attacks would likely disrupt both friendly and enemy units. In certain cases, this could benefit the user if it is less reliant on susceptible electronics. However, it may be more suitable for attacking a target nation that is physically separated from the battlefield. For example, Russia could employ a lower-altitude HANE over the United States to disrupt its geographically distant battlefield efforts in Eastern Europe. Attacks like these could significantly impact an enemy while costing little in terms of technological fratricide or direct loss of human life and could potentially have less chance of large-scale escalation than the use of a surface nuclear weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reality-1-hanes-offer-a-less-provocative-option-than-ground-based-nuclear-detonations&quot;&gt;Reality #1: HANEs Offer a Less Provocative Option than Ground-Based Nuclear Detonations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HANEs do not have the same direct effects on human lives. As they are detonated at an altitude where the atmosphere is very thin or nonexistent, this means no significant air blast will arrive on the ground and harm civilians or infrastructure. Additionally, very little prompt or delayed radiation will make it to the Earth’s surface due to attenuation or absorption by the atmosphere. The airblast, thermal, and radiation effects from traditional surface or near-surface detonations could lead to the direct deaths of millions of people and could prompt an equal or greater retaliatory strike on the state that originally employed such a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HANEs offer a favorable option by avoiding these direct lethal effects on civilians. They can be targeted to primarily affect electronics on the ground, satellites, or a combination of both. Those detonated between the sweet spot of 30–50 kilometers (19–31 miles) above sea level create HEMPs that impact electronics on the ground but have less effect on satellites. This could be a desirable option for a state that wants to limit damage to its own satellites and minimize escalatory concerns associated with damaging nuclear command, control, and communications (NC3) satellites. HANEs detonated above that altitude also have the potential to destroy LEO satellites, causing catastrophic global economic effects and potentially affecting NC3 systems in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reality-2-hanes-will-still-cause-human-suffering&quot;&gt;Reality #2: HANEs Will Still Cause Human Suffering&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the detonation would not directly kill humans, the indirect effects likely would. The long-term loss of power plants, cellular towers, and access to satellites would have profound effects on the affected population. In 2008, the U.S. congressional commission released a study on HEMP effects on U.S. territory. It noted, even 17 years ago, that the “pervasive use of electronics of all forms represents the greatest source of vulnerability to attack by EMP.” The report offered a somber acknowledgement of the long-term consequences of a HEMP attack on the United States:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A single EMP attack may seriously degrade or shut down a large part of the electric power grid. . . . Electrical power is necessary to support other critical infrastructures. . . . Many people may ultimately die for lack of the basic elements necessary to sustain life in dense urban and suburban communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, Congress implemented several recommendations for U.S. power grids. These mitigate the risk but are unlikely to completely defend against loss of life. Additionally, less-developed nations remain vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reality--3-the-effects-of-hanes-can-be-anticipated-and-mitigated&quot;&gt;Reality # 3: The Effects of HANEs Can Be Anticipated and Mitigated&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple steps policymakers can take to mitigate the effects of HANEs in future conflicts. Satellite effects can be reduced by focusing on radiation hardening to include shielding, physical changes of circuitry, and redundancy. Radiation-hardening components designed to withstand extreme post-HANE environments are currently a niche market for critical military satellites. The emphasis on hardening could be expanded to a broader set of devices, especially as many commercial satellites are starting to be used on the battlefield. HEMP effects within the Earth’s atmosphere can also be mitigated. Increased emphasis on HEMP testing could identify the most vulnerable systems early in the acquisition process so that these systems are designed with increased HEMP survivability from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the impact of HANEs can be mitigated through decreasing dependency on electronic systems and training. Military leaders should be wary of single capabilities that may be susceptible to an enemy HANE. Leaders should incorporate training scenarios for their soldiers that recreate degraded environments where some key capabilities are taken away, such as radios and GPS. Additionally, soldiers can be trained on how to minimize the effects of an EMP, for example, by ensuring there is redundancy in their communications pathways. They can also be trained in how to troubleshoot, identify, and (if necessary) repair damaged components of a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While HANEs’ exact impact and long-term destruction will vary, this paper seeks to highlight what is known and dispel popular misunderstandings about them. In the past, global agreements formed a bulwark against the use of nuclear devices, but states are now relooking at their nuclear inventories and considering using these powerful devices in unconventional ways to achieve their goals. Leaders can no longer ignore this threat and the relevant effects posed by HANEs. Military leaders need to be cognizant of their effects on warfighters and capabilities, and local leaders need to understand their effects on power plants and civilian life. While the impacts of HANEs are difficult to grasp, there are tangible ways for U.S. policymakers and military leaders to mitigate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite deterrence efforts, cyber threats continue to escalate, highlighting the need for greater accountability from and cost imposition on malicious actors. The U.S. 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy emphasizes imposing costs on malicious actors and reinforcing alliances; the Republic of Korea’s (ROK) 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy also prioritizes offensive cyber defense and global cooperation. Since 2018, U.S. Cyber Command’s “Defend Forward” policy has resulted in 40 Hunt Forward operations across 21 countries, exposing threats from major adversaries. Similarly, the European Union’s updated 2023 Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox stresses situational awareness and the importance of holding persistent threat actors accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attributing cyberattacks and formulating response strategies are inherently political processes shaped by national security priorities, diplomatic relations, and geopolitical considerations. Governments must balance deterrence with escalation risks, ensuring proportionality and international legitimacy. It is therefore difficult to establish a single, uniform standard for response. Nevertheless, consistent policy is necessary, as the absence of clear frameworks increases political burdens, delays decisionmaking, and results in inconsistent responses that can confuse allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A national framework for classifying cyberattack severity enhances objectivity, guiding policy decisions and facilitating mutual understanding between nations. Although South Korea has shown strong political will to respond to malicious cyber activities, it lacks a clear legal and policy framework for response procedures. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a Cyberattack Severity Classification Framework (CSCF) to objectively assess and categorize cyberattacks, supporting informed decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;purposes-of-the-cyberattack-severity-classification-framework&quot;&gt;Purposes of the Cyberattack Severity Classification Framework&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Political Decisionmaking and Strengthen the Framework for Cost Imposition and Accountability:&lt;/strong&gt; The CSCF supports the ROK government’s political decisionmaking regarding cost imposition and accountability for malicious actors and their state sponsors at the international level. In doing so, the framework helps facilitate sustained international engagement in cyber threat mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a Basis for International Cooperation:&lt;/strong&gt; Publicly sharing a national cyberattack severity assessment framework promotes transparency. By aligning with common evaluation criteria, the CSCF supports mutual understanding, helps partners better interpret intent, and strengthens situational awareness, playing a crucial role in advancing international cooperation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study, part of a project to enhance ROK-U.S. cybersecurity cooperation, aims to classify cyberattack severity at the national level to support shared understanding and coordinated responses. It reviews government-led models and simplifies criteria around core items for clarity and efficiency. Case studies of state-sponsored cyberattacks in the United States and ROK over the past decade will test the framework’s applicability. Although the CSCF is limited by its reliance on public data, it seeks to support cost imposition efforts and to provide a foundation for international cooperation against cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;national-and-international-methodologies&quot;&gt;National and International Methodologies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;United States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;presidential-policy-directive-41-ppd-41-us-cyber-incident-coordination&quot;&gt;Presidential Policy Directive 41 (PPD-41): U.S. Cyber Incident Coordination&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PPD-41 (2016) aims to enhance national security by managing and coordinating responses to significant cyber incidents. The United States defines a significant cyber incident as a group of related events, rather than a single isolated incident. PPD-41 introduces the Cyber Incident Severity Schema (CISS) to establish a unified federal understanding of incident severity, supporting coordinated national-level responses to significant incidents. CISS outlines six levels—Emergency, Severe, High, Medium, Low, and Baseline—based on the scope of the incidents and their impact on national security and public safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scope and Impact: Evaluates the level of observed or potential effects on national security, public health, critical infrastructure, the economy, and public confidence&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observed Actions: Categorizes incidents into preparation, engagement, presence, and effect phases&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intended Consequence: Assesses attacker intent and potential damage scope&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-cyber-incident-scoring-system-nciss&quot;&gt;National Cyber Incident Scoring System (NCISS)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the NCISS provides a consistent method of assessing cyber incidents and prioritizing the response to them across federal agencies. It assigns risk scores to incidents, which then guide response priorities and resource allocation. However, the NCISS struggles to assess simultaneous related incidents, relying on expert judgment instead of predefined criteria, which can cause inconsistencies and reduce objectivity in assessments. The NCISS uses the same six-level severity scale outlined by the CISS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Functional Impact: Effect on organizational operations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observed Activity: Behavior of the threat actor&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Location of Observed Activity: Network areas where malicious activities are detected&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actor Characteristics: Capabilities and intentions of the threat actor&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Information Impact: Sensitivity of compromised data&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recoverability: Resources required for incident recovery&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cross-Sector Dependency: Connections between critical infrastructure sectors&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Potential Impact: Scale and significance of the affected organization&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;European Union&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nis-directive-20&quot;&gt;NIS Directive 2.0&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NIS Directive 2.0 (2022) establishes a unified framework for network and information security across the European Union. It covers a wide range of critical infrastructure and essential services vital to public safety, economic stability, and national security. Entities are required to assess and report cyber incidents that cause or could cause severe operational disruptions, financial losses, or significant harm to individuals or organizations. The scope of critical infrastructure and essential services includes sectors such as energy (electricity, oil, gas, and hydrogen), transport (air, rail, water, and road), banking and financial systems, healthcare, water supply, digital infrastructure (e.g., domain name systems, content delivery networks, and cloud), information and communication technology service management, public administration, and space-related organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact on service operations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Financial impact&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact on other individuals or organizations (material or nonmaterial)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Importance of affected networks and information systems to the entity’s service delivery&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Severity and technical characteristics of the cyber threat&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extent of impact on service functionality&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Duration of the incident&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Number of affected service recipients&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether the entity has experienced similar incidents previously&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether the incident was due to malicious or unlawful acts&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Possibility of cross-border impacts&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cybersecurity-incident-taxonomy-cit&quot;&gt;Cybersecurity Incident Taxonomy (CIT)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU CIT, proposed by the NIS Cooperation Group in 2018, offers a standardized framework for classifying cybersecurity incidents at strategic and political levels. It aims to enhance coordination of incident response activities across the European Union and facilitate cross-border information sharing and cooperation. According to a 2022 Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) report, many European Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) or relevant bodies are utilizing the EU CIT in their processes. Notably, Estonia has adopted the EU CIT as a national model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attack Target: Sector affected by the cyberattack (e.g., energy, transport, finance, healthcare, water, digital infrastructure, government services)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Threat Severity: Technical risk level of the threat&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact Severity: Societal or economic damage level&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-diplomacy-toolbox-cdt&quot;&gt;Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox (CDT)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDT is an EU framework designed to prevent, deter, and respond to malicious cyber activities, promoting solidarity and mutual support among member states. The CDT emphasizes the importance of shared situational awareness and information sharing among EU member states, aiming to improve the understanding of the European Union’s threat environment and encourage the use of the CDT to support decisionmaking. It strengthens coordinated strategies to counter persistent cyber threat actors, reinforces the international obligation of due diligence, and introduces additional response options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;categorization-model-for-cyber-incidents-cmci&quot;&gt;Categorization Model for Cyber Incidents (CMCI)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in 2023 used the CMCI to classify cyber incidents based on severity and potential impact. It ensures effective resource allocation and response coordination across sectors, including government, critical infrastructure, businesses, and individuals. The NCSC and National Crime Agency (NCA) oversee assessments. Severity levels are classified into six tiers, similar to the U.S. CISS model, based on the scope of affected targets (e.g., nation, institution, individual) and the level of socioeconomic impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;National Security Impact: Disruptions to essential services, potential harm to life or national security&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scale of Disruption: Level of interference in services or operations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic and Social Impact: Financial losses, data breaches, privacy violations, and social consequences&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attack Target: Categorizes affected entities such as critical infrastructure, government, enterprises, small- and medium-sized enterprises, and individuals&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-regulations-2020-cr&quot;&gt;Cyber Regulations 2020 (CR)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cyber Regulations 2020 were established under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 to counter cyber activities threatening the United Kingdom’s integrity, economy, and security. These regulations allow the United Kingdom to impose sanctions on individuals or entities involved in cyber threats, including asset freezes and travel bans. Although the regulation does not explicitly define assessment criteria, it outlines the definition of relevant cyber activity and types of cyber activities, which form the basis of the assessment criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intent: Whether the attack aimed to cause harm&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scope of Impact: Number of affected people or systems&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target: Whether the attack was on critical infrastructure or essential services&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;France&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-cyber-attack-classification-scheme-ncacs&quot;&gt;National Cyber Attack Classification Scheme (NCACS)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France’s Cyber Review (2018) introduced a cyberattack classification system to enhance threat assessment and response coordination. The NCACS highlights the need for a clear understanding of cyberattacks and rapid analysis of attack techniques for proportionate responses. Its classification scheme aims to enhance shared understanding, support decisionmaking, and promote international cooperation on cross-border incidents. The framework prioritizes impact-based evaluations, covering completed or imminent attacks that require urgent responses. Severity levels, compatible with the U.S. CISS, are classified into six tiers based on the scope and impact of cyber incidents. However, the NCACS incorporates international legal considerations, including the possibility of an armed attack under UN Charter Article 51, with the most severe level designated as “possibly assessable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact: Effect on national interests, security, the economy, and the environment&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical Capability: Attack sophistication and methods used&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intent: Motivations behind the attack&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target Risk: The affected entity’s significance&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scale: Attack severity and widespread effects&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Repetition: Frequency and relation to past incidents&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Canada&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;government-cyber-security-event-management-plan-gc-csemp&quot;&gt;Government Cyber Security Event Management Plan (GC CSEMP)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada’s Federal Cyber Incident Response Plan differentiates between general and critical incidents, with critical incidents addressed under the GC CSEMP (2023). The GC CSEMP ensures coordinated cyber incident management across government systems, led by the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security and the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat’s Office of the Chief Information Officer (TBS-OCIO). It includes the Injury Test, which assesses cyber incident severity and scope, and the Risk Assessment, which evaluates potential exposure. This report focuses on the Injury Test, which sorts incidents into four levels based on their scope and severity. Each level is defined by the extent of damage across five areas—public health, financial loss, government services, national security, and reputation—to provide clearer understanding of the attack’s severity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Severity: Degree of harm across domains such as public health, financial loss, government services, national sovereignty, national security, and reputation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scope: Extent of impact in terms of the number of affected individuals, organizations, facilities, or systems; the geographic area (e.g., international, national, multiple sectors, single sector or jurisdiction, individual or small business); and the duration&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Australia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-incident-categorization-matrix-cicm&quot;&gt;Cyber Incident Categorization Matrix (CICM)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) developed the CICM to prioritize incident response and ensure appropriate measures. Continuously updated, it is used by the Australian Cyber Security Centre to classify and manage cyber incidents effectively, as well as provide annual cyber incident statistics. Severity levels are classified into six tiers based on the intensity of cyber effects and the significance of the affected organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cyber Effect: Evaluates impact based on attack success, persistence, and intent (e.g., disruption to critical systems, broad or localized compromise, coordinated or isolated low-level attacks, or failed attacks)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Significance: Assesses the importance of affected organizations (e.g., the general public, small to large organizations, educational and research institutions, local to federal governments, critical infrastructure, and national security systems)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cybersecurity-incident-classification-guide&quot;&gt;Cybersecurity Incident Classification Guide&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To standardize incident reporting and enhance security, China issued the Cybersecurity Incident Reporting Administrative Measures Draft (2023) under the Cybersecurity Law, defining severity levels and standardizing response procedures for government agencies, critical infrastructure operators, and network service providers. Similarly to GC CSEMP, severity is classified into four levels whose severity is defined across five dimensions—system disruption, data leakage, social impact, economic loss, and harmful information spread—to support rapid decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;System Loss and Functional Disruption: Network failures affecting critical operations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Information Leakage and Data Loss: Exposure of state secrets and sensitive information&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social Impact: Number of affected people and essential service users&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic Loss: Direct financial damage&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harmful Information Spread: Dissemination of illegal or harmful content&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary and Comparison&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-characteristics-of-national-frameworks&quot;&gt;Key Characteristics of National Frameworks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States assesses cyber incident severity through the CISS framework, integrating PPD-41 and the NCISS. The NCISS uses a quantitative, weighted scoring system to promote consistent assessment practices across the federal government and critical infrastructure sectors. CISA conducts evaluations based on reports from affected entities to ensure consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union classifies incidents via the NIS Directive, CIT, and CDT, sharing core criteria. The CIT, adopted by some member states like Estonia, supports standardized classification and information sharing. Both the NIS Directive and CIT classify attacks on critical infrastructure and essential services as critical threats, clearly identifying relevant sectors and applying broad coverage. One limitation is that these guidelines—particularly the CIT and CDT—are non-binding recommendations, and therefore not applied consistently across all EU member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom classifies cyber incidents through the CMCI and Cyber Regulation, which evaluate attack targets as well as economic, operational, and social impact. The sanctions regulation also considers attacker intent (malicious or unlawful) to ensure accountability and cost imposition on threat actors. Similar to the U.S. system, the NCSC and NCA carry out categorization to promote consistent assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France employs cyber incident severity classification to support proportionate responses to malicious activities, emphasizing situational awareness and international cooperation. The NCACS is designed to be compatible with the U.S. CISS, aiming to enhance mutual understanding of cyber threat levels in the context of international coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada’s GC CSEMP assesses threats and risks using a matrix-based system to determine response levels. Similarly to the United Kingdom, Canada classifies attack targets by scale and considers the transnational scope of incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s CICM prioritizes victim importance and impact, using a simplified approach. The government maintains and updates its matrix, publishing annual statistics on the severity of cyber incidents in Australia to enhance awareness. The 2023 update categorizes impact by scope, focusing on supply chains, shared services, and critical infrastructure. Australia’s framework remains adaptive to changing cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has introduced a cyber incident classification guide and is developing supporting legislation. While it is similar to international models in most assessment criteria, China’s system emphasizes controlling harmful information, in line with state information policies. The framework includes quantitative standards, enabling rapid identification and reporting of major cyber incidents, though the basis for these standards is not explicitly provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;core-criteria&quot;&gt;Core Criteria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across countries, cyber incident assessment criteria generally outline three tiers of importance. Core criteria—such as the scope and importance of the target; attacker intent; impacts on operations, the economy, society, and national security; potential loss of life; and scale and duration—are prioritized in most frameworks. Frequently considered but less emphasized are secondary factors like technical capabilities and incident frequency. Finally, other factors—such as infrastructure dependencies, attack success, harmful information dissemination, and recoverability—are selectively used depending on the context and purpose of the assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While national goals vary, many countries acknowledge the value of severity classification frameworks for crisis response, resource allocation, and international cooperation. Notably, models like the European Union’s CDT, the United Kingdom’s regulatory framework, and France’s NCACS show how classification can support accountability and diplomatic engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cyberattack-severity-classification-framework-cscf&quot;&gt;Cyberattack Severity Classification Framework (CSCF)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assessment-criteria&quot;&gt;Assessment Criteria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSCF criteria are based on international frameworks and focus on core criteria to improve efficiency and consistency. While international models incorporate a wider range of factors, this framework prioritizes core criteria by grouping them into three main categories—attack target, attacker intent, and impact—comprising a total of seven sub-criteria, all organized into three levels for simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack Target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Scope&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assesses scope by affected entity range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High: Nationwide or multinational impact&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium: Regional or multi-organization impact&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low: Localized or single-organization impact&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Importance of Affected Targets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assesses the criticality and sensitivity of the affected organizations and systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High: Organizations crucial to national security, such as critical infrastructure or government agencies, based on the critical infrastructure sectors defined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the ROK’s Act on the Protection of Information and Communications Infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium: Large-scale private sector organizations, including major enterprises. The criteria for defining large enterprises in the ROK and the United States are as follows (though they may differ by industry in both countries):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;South Korea: Large-scale enterprises are defined by the Korean government as organizations with total assets exceeding 10 trillion KRW.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;United States: Large enterprises are generally defined as those with more than 500 employees or annual revenue exceeding $47 million, according to the Small Business Administration (SBA).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low: Smaller organizations or those with limited national significance&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attacker Intent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Intent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assesses the goals and motivations of the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High: Goal-oriented attackers—including state-sponsored groups or international hacking organizations—conducting long-term operations for political or economic gain&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium: Criminal actors pursuing monetary gains&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low: Opportunistic or unintentional actors with no clear objectives&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Functional Impact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assesses the disruption or degradation of critical functions and services. Time thresholds, such as the recovery time objective (RTO) or maximum tolerable downtime (MTD), are used as benchmarks. The time thresholds may vary depending on the importance of the organization and system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High: Significant damage or prolonged interruptions, such as system downtimes exceeding the RTO or MTD&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;South Korea: The RTO for critical government systems can be set within three hours. The Ministry of Interior and Safety in South Korea has set the MTD for government systems at three hours.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;United States: The RTO for national or mission-essential functions is generally set within 12 hours. According to NIST Special Publication 800-34 Rev. 1 (Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems), the recovery time for functions that are national, primary, or mission-essential must be within 12 hours to ensure operational continuity.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium: Partial damage or interruptions, such as disruptions contained within the RTO or MTD limit&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low: Minor or no impact on functions and services&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Information Impact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assesses the compromise of data integrity, confidentiality, or availability:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High: Breach of classified or sensitive information&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium: Breach of non-classified or general information&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low: Minor or no impact on information&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. Economic Impact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assesses the financial and economic damage caused by cyberattacks. The thresholds used are reference values informed by the U.S. CISA report Cost of a Cyber Incident, which systematically analyzes financial impacts (with a methodology detailed in Appendix A of this paper).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;South Korea: Financial loss exceeding 20 billion KRW (approximately $15.7 million) or affected population of more than 10 million individuals&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;United States: Financial loss exceeding $157 million or an affected population of more than 72 million individuals&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;South Korea: Financial loss between 5 billion and 20 billion KRW (approximately $4 million to $15.7 million) or affected population of 1–10 million individuals&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;United States: Financial loss between $40 million and $157 million or an affected population of 8–72 million individuals&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;South Korea: Financial loss below 5 billion KRW (approximately $4 million) or an affected population of fewer than 1 million individuals&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;United States: Financial loss below $40 million or an affected population of fewer than 8 million individuals&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7. Political and Social Impact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This considers the implications for national security, reputation, public relations, and societal responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High: Severe impacts, including extensive media coverage, significant social media backlash, substantial drops in presidential approval ratings, or a decline in international trust indices&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium: Moderate impacts with notable effects on public perception or international relations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low: Minor or localized effects with limited public attention&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;weighting-of-assessment-criteria&quot;&gt;Weighting of Assessment Criteria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, a cyber operation’s classification as a use of force or severe attack depends on scale, effects, and target. And the UN GGE and OEWG, two international initiatives on cyberspace norms, emphasize that attacks on critical infrastructure pose significant risks and are considered particularly severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A survey conducted by the OSCE identified impact and damage scale as the most critical criteria for assessing cyberattacks, followed by attack target. Similarly, a 2022 survey by the National Security Research Institute (NSR) in South Korea found that experts ranked attack sector, importance of the damaged system, and damage scale as the top factors influencing cyber severity assessments (detailed in Appendix B of this paper).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prioritization aligns with a broader consensus that cyberattack assessments should focus on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact, including social, functional, and economic consequences&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target, especially when critical infrastructure is affected&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSCF reflects importance by letting the number of items in each category influence the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scoring-and-severity-levels&quot;&gt;Scoring and Severity Levels&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSCF determines severity by assigning scores to assessment criteria, with a maximum score of 35 points. Each criterion is scored on a three-tier scale based on severity: High (4–5 points), Medium (2–3 points), and Low (0–1 point). The framework uses the total score across all criteria to categorize cyber incidents into six severity levels—Normal, Low, Medium, High, Severe, and Critical—aligning with the CISS used in the United States and France. The United Kingdom and Australia also follow a similar six-tier classification model. Using comparable severity levels helps promote mutual understanding of assessment results among nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BeUCN0h.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Cyberattack Severity Level&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cumulative-effects&quot;&gt;Cumulative Effects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks from major adversarial states are often parts of broader strategic campaigns rather than isolated incidents. These operations typically unfold within the “gray zone,” staying below the threshold of armed conflict to avoid direct retaliation. Attackers employ long-term reconnaissance and persistent access, expanding their targets from individual systems to interconnected networks to achieve their strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing cyber incidents in isolation risks underestimating their intent and cumulative effect. To address this, viewing a cyberattack as part of a broader campaign not only strengthens the assessor’s ability to make political attributions but also provides a deeper understanding of the attacker’s strategic objectives and operational patterns. In line with this, U.S. PPD-41 recognizes that a series of related incidents with cumulative effects may qualify as a Significant Cyber Incident, and NATO’s 2021 Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy acknowledges that such activities could, under certain conditions, be classified as an armed attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating cumulative effects into the severity assessment process also helps mitigate a key limitation of the CSCF: the potential perception that low-level or sub-threshold attacks will go unaddressed. By accounting for the cumulative effect of recurring or persistent malicious activity, the framework conveys that even seemingly minor incidents may be evaluated and incorporated into broader strategic assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To evaluate cumulative effects, a composite approach should be applied across the assessment criteria. For each criterion, the scope should be aggregated across incidents; the importance of affected targets should be assessed based on the most critical target; intent should reflect the most hostile objective; and impacts should be accumulated to reflect the overall effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-studies&quot;&gt;Case Studies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper’s case study applied the CSCF to 21 cyberattacks over the past decade, primarily targeting the ROK and United States, focusing on critical infrastructure and state-sponsored hacking activities. The results are presented in Table 3. While the initial assessment covered 21 cases, 2 incidents were re-evaluated by applying cumulative effect, bringing the total to 23 entries in the table. Entries 1 through 8 correspond to the ROK and 9 through 20 to the United States. Entry 21 involves a German target, included for cumulative analysis, while entries 22 and 23 reflect re-assessed cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment presents EuRepoC’s cyber intensity and impact scores as a comparative benchmark to provide context for the CSCF results. Where EuRepoC scores are unavailable, the corresponding table entries are marked as blank. EuRepoC, an open-access database supported by EU member state governments, measures cyber intensity based on direct effects and sociopolitical severity, while its impact indicator evaluates broader consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EuRepoC’s cyber intensity is categorized into three levels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1–5: Low/Moderate (Green); 6–10: High (Yellow); 11–15: Very High (Red)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impact is classified into five levels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1–5: Minor (White); 6–10: Low (Green); 11–15: Medium (Yellow); 16–20: High (Orange); 21–25: Very High (Red)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, cyberattacks ranged from Medium to High severity according to the CSCF, with cases like the KHNP Hacking (Entry 1) and the Pyeongchang Olympics Hacking (Entry 3) showing notable social and political impact. Although the KHNP Hacking caused limited direct disruption, it triggered public alarm by targeting nuclear facilities, and led to the development of South Korea’s cybersecurity strategy. It was classified as High severity under the CSCF. However, according to EuRepoC, both cases were rated within the Low/Moderate intensity range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean hacking groups were responsible for the most severe attacks on South Korea, particularly the 2023 Andariel IT Company Breach (Entry 7) and the 2024 Defense Contractor Breach (Entry 8), both of which targeted military intelligence and defense technology. The Defense Contractor Breach received the highest scores under the CSCF due to its significant informational and social impact. In contrast, according to EuRepoC, Entry 7 was rated as Low/Moderate in intensity and Low in impact, while Entry 8 was assessed as High in intensity but still rated as Low in impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, facing more frequent and severe cyber threats compared to South Korea, exhibited higher severity levels in CSCF-based assessments, with attacks classified as Medium to Severe. High-profile cases such as SolarWinds (Entry 13), Colonial Pipeline (Entry 17), Volt Typhoon (Entry 18), and Salt Typhoon (Entry 19) reached Severe under the CSCF due to their impact on national security and critical infrastructure. Additionally, the Hive Ransomware Attack (Entry 14) was rated Severe according to the CSCF, since it caused significant financial and operational disruptions. In contrast, according to EuRepoC, the Hive Ransomware Attack was rated as Low/Moderate in intensity and Low in impact. For the remaining cases, while some were assessed as High in intensity, all were rated Medium or lower in impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases in which cumulative effect is applicable under the CSCF include the 2022 Defense Manufacturer Attack (Entry 6), and the 2024 Defense Contractor Breach (Entry 8), both by North Korean groups targeting South Korean defense contractors; and the 2024 Diehl Defense Breach (Entry 21) involving a German missile supplier, which also fits this pattern. Though individually limited, their cumulative effect within the “North Korea Defense Breach Campaign” justifies a reclassification to Severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2015–2016 DNC hacking incidents (Entry 10) in the United States are attributed to Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear as part of Russia’s election interference efforts. Along with the post-election spear-phishing attacks (Entry 11) by the same threat actors and with the same political aim, these incidents can be collectively referred to as the “Russian U.S. Election Interference Campaign.” When assessed as a broader campaign, the impact increases and may justify a Severe classification under the CSCF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the CSCF and EuRepoC showed a similar relative ranking of cases—those rated highly under the CSCF generally also received higher ratings under EuRepoC. However, EuRepoC tended to assign lower absolute intensity and impact scores compared to the CSCF. This alignment in severity levels was slightly closer in U.S. cases, while ROK cases showed some differences, likely due to EuRepoC’s EU-centric focus on large-scale impacts. Since political and economic impacts vary by national context, frameworks like the CSCF—which present reference points informed by such context—are better suited to national-level assessment. In particular, because the importance of the attack target is a critical factor in national security considerations, the CSCF has enabled more appropriate severity assessments in such contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cZSpmS0.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: CSCF Case Studies Over the Past Decade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSCF provides a systematic framework for assessing cyberattack severity, thereby enhancing situational awareness and supporting the ROK government’s political decisionmaking. It promotes international understanding, facilitates national cost imposition efforts, and supports joint responses. This approach aligns with the strategic goals of the ROK-U.S. Cybersecurity Cooperation Framework, which emphasizes countering and deterring malicious cyber activities while holding responsible states accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSCF was developed through comparative analysis to identify core criteria and organize them into three categories: impact, target scope, and intent. The framework also offers detailed sub-criteria with reference points based on publicly available data. When applied to cases, high-profile incidents such as the Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon were classified as Severe, effectively capturing their national security implications. Moreover, when multiple attacks by the same hacking group with similar objectives were assessed cumulatively as part of a single campaign—such as the North Korea Defense Breach Campaign—the attacks’ severity levels increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case study results underscore the need for a national-level classification framework that reflects country-specific contexts. The CSCF is particularly well-suited for evaluating the severity of cyberattacks in South Korea, especially from a national security perspective. Such a framework enhances understanding of domestic cyber incident severity and can serve as a foundation for improving mutual understanding in the context of future ROK-U.S. cybersecurity cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks have grown in scale and complexity over the past two decades. Unlike traditional military deterrence, deterrence in the cyber domain lacks clear red lines and established response thresholds, and allows a degree of anonymity. As a result, few cyberattacks have led to meaningful consequences, and major threat actors continue to exploit cyber capabilities. Therefore, active national-level responses that impose costs and ensure accountability are essential. Ultimately, response depends on national resolve, operational capacity, and coordinated action among like-minded nations. Nevertheless, continued research is needed not only to support political decisionmaking but also to foster international consensus. In addition, ensuring consistent assessments requires a dedicated agency for ongoing evaluations—as seen in the United States and United Kingdom—highlighting the need for a similar system in the ROK. Such an agency should share assessment results with stakeholders and foster a unified understanding of cyberattack severity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When countries design their cyber defense strategies, they do so on the premise that they can defend against malicious cyber operations only after the impacts of such acts materialize. Instead of taking this reactive posture, however, the United States spearheaded a paradigm shift to a proactive posture in 2018, when the Department of Defense (DOD) developed the “Defend Forward” strategy. This posture has since been maintained in the United States, and was reaffirmed in the introduction of the 2023 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy. Variations on this approach have been adopted by some countries, including the Republic of Korea (ROK). South Korea introduced a proactive approach to cyber defense in its 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy, some aspects of which mirror the DOD’s Defend Forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proactive cyber defense is just one option available to countries responding to cyber threats. In general, response options are various and can be structured with a range of typologies. For instance, options can diverge into defensive and offensive responses; defensive responses, in turn, can be classified as either reactive or proactive. Public attribution and countermeasures under international law are examples of reactive defense; proactive defense can include active cyber defense and other threat-hunting activities. In certain circumstances, alternatives to proactive cyber defense can be more effective. This paper is based on this conceptualization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For proactive defense, countries need to glean insights into adversaries’ acts in cyberspace before their impacts reach the intended targets. These insights are mostly embedded in physical infrastructures that adversaries exploit for malicious cyber operations—facilities primarily located in foreign territories. That is why working with allies and partners is crucial for proactive cyber defense. Fortunately, South Korea and the United States have made a great effort to cooperate in this space over the last few years. Such cooperation is primarily based on the alliance between the two countries. This paper aims to explore areas in which South Korea and the United States must deepen their collaboration to bolster their proactiveness in cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;moving-toward-a-proactive-posture&quot;&gt;Moving Toward a Proactive Posture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2019 National Cybersecurity Strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the administration of former South Korean President Moon Jae-in unveiled South Korea’s first National Cybersecurity Strategy. The defensive stance outlined in the 2019 strategy can be characterized as reactive rather than proactive. The strategy’s second strategic task, “enhancement of cyberattack response capability,” offers a glimpse into this reactive stance. According to the 2019 National Cybersecurity Basic Plan, an implementation plan of the 2019 strategy, the administration, with a view to enforce cyberattack response capabilities, undertakes to (i) secure cyber deterrence by managing vulnerabilities and taking steps for attribution; (ii) fortify readiness against massive cyberattacks by revamping the framework for national response and developing cyberattack detection technologies; (iii) seek comprehensive and active means of response through international cooperation with like-minded partners and reinforcement of cyber warfare capacities; and (iv) improve cybercrime response by enhancing investigation and prosecution capabilities. In sum, the 2019 strategy appears to have been crafted without consideration of the proactive defense concept. The 2019 strategy is significant in that it represented the first-ever national cybersecurity strategy in South Korea and established a governance framework where the National Security Office of the Blue House took the lead in national cybersecurity. However, its strategic ideas concerning cyber defense seem to have remained at a rudimentary stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2024, then-President Yoon Suk Yeol’s administration made public the second National Cybersecurity Strategy, which shifted South Korea’s approach to an offensive posture. In the 2024 strategy, the country set the “development of offensive cyber defense and response capabilities” as one of three primary objectives crucial to fulfilling its strategic vision of acting as a “global pivotal state.” To that end, South Korea set forth five strategic tasks, one of which is “enhancing offensive cyber defense activities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the 2024 strategy calls its defensive posture “offensive cyber defense,” the strategy’s posture is not so offensive that such naming is necessary, particularly considering the subtasks that South Korea is indeed planning to carry out to fortify “offensive cyber defense.” The strategy’s subtasks are specified in the National Cybersecurity Basic Plan, which details the activities that the administration intends to implement in pursuit of offensive cyber defense. These include establishing public attribution; tracing threat actors’ cyber infrastructure; issuing joint advisories; and collecting and analyzing threat intelligence over attack origins, among other things. Although some of these subtasks may have offensive elements, these activities do not comfortably fit under the term “offensive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, inadequate naming could give rise to mischaracterization and misinterpretation, and thus escalation. It is hard to draw a clear line between the defensive and the offensive in cyberspace. In the spectrum of cyber activities, purely defensive actions such as firewall protections sit at one end, while offensive operations to destruct or destroy targets sit at the other end. It is hard to tell where on this spectrum the administration’s “offensive cyber defense” sits. Given this, use of the term “offensive” may risk signaling that South Korea would resort to the spectrum’s offensive extreme, which is not the intention reflected in the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to enhance offensive cyber defense, the Yoon administration’s strategy highlights three main activities, some of which can be regarded as reflecting a proactive approach. The first is attribution. In the strategy, South Korea stated that it will identify the perpetrators of cyberattacks that impair national security and national interests by mobilizing the legal and technical capabilities necessary for attribution. The country also emphasized that it will use scientific evidence to identify actors behind cyberattacks and hold them accountable for their malicious behavior. To this end, South Korea is set to establish a procedure and standard for attribution and employ it to build a foundation for international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second activity highlighted in the strategy is the strengthening of joint deterrence with partner countries. The administration seeks to maximize deterrence of threat actors through the issuance of joint cybersecurity advisories, which South Korea has actively issued with partners over the last few years. For instance, in July 2024, South Korea issued a joint cybersecurity advisory on APT40—a group sponsored by China—with the relevant ministries of Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In the same month, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States issued a joint security advisory on the activities of the Andariel, a hacking group under the Reconnaissance General Bureau of North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third activity is preemptive and proactive response through active detection and attack origin analysis. This reflects an approach similar to the United States’ Defend Forward. South Korea’s strategy gives its intelligence agency and its military a preemptive and proactive mission to detect and analyze the sources of cyberattacks, catch signs of attacks in advance, and quickly share information with relevant ministries. To implement this, the 2024 National Cybersecurity Basic Plan states that South Korea will develop technologies to identify threat actors and track their bases, infrastructure, and activities. Notably, there is a nuanced difference between attribution and the identification of the source of a cyberattack. The former is a procedure necessary to impose responsibility—i.e., legal or political costs—on persons or states conducting malicious acts in cyberspace. On the other hand, the purpose of source identification is to proactively track down the source of the attack before the intended target is affected, reducing the impact (if any) on the target’s network. With this third element, South Korea can be seen as taking a step toward proactive cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;organizational-framework-and-proactive-cyber-defense&quot;&gt;Organizational Framework and Proactive Cyber Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, the National Security Office (NSO) is responsible for coordinating overall cybersecurity-related tasks as well as setting up and reviewing mid- to long-term policy directions. Under the coordination of the NSO, governmental agencies and departments carry out their respective cybersecurity-related responsibilities. In particular, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) and the Cyber Command under the Ministry of National Defense (MND) play central roles in proactive cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As South Korea rearranged its cybersecurity strategy in 2024, the National Intelligence Service Act and its presidential decree, the Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, were amended accordingly and entered into force. As a result, the NIS’s four major cybersecurity duties became more refined and streamlined. First, the NIS performs intelligence activities for national cybersecurity. That is, the NIS collects, prepares, and distributes intelligence on international hacking organizations or state-sponsored hacking groups (NIS Act, Article 4(1)(1)(e); Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, Article 3(1)(a)). Second, the NIS takes measures to identify, deter, and block threatening cyber activities conducted by North Korea; foreign states, nationals, or organizations; transnational actors; or South Koreans affiliated with any of these entities (NIS Act, Article 4(1)(3); Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, Article 3(1)(b)). Third, the NIS takes preventive and responsive measures against cyberattacks and threats on public entities (NIS Act, Article 4(1)(4); Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, Article 3(2)(a)). Fourth, the NIS is entitled to establish and operate a consolidated response governance in which public and private entities jointly work to manage and respond to crises (Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, Article 6 bis (4)). In the event of a crisis, the NIS’s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) serves as the Cyber Threat Task Force (CTTF) tasked with responding; in times when there is no active crisis, the agency functions as the National Cyber Risk Management Unit (NCRMU).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of South Korea’s proactive cyber defense, Article 6 bis of the Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty must be highlighted. This article was newly introduced in the revised Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty in 2024. According to paragraph three of Article 6 bis, the director of the NIS may take necessary steps to proactively identify, deter, and block activities against national security and interests. Such measures under this provision may include tracking and neutralizing foreign and North Korean bases. This provision provides a legal basis for the NIS’s proactive cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s Cyber Command also assumes cybersecurity tasks, mostly those related to national defense. The Cyber Command was established under the MND to take control of these duties in 2011 (Presidential Decree on Cyber Command, Article 1; the Cyber Command was originally established in 2010 under the Defense Intelligence Command of the Ministry of National Defense. In 2011, the Cyber Command became a unit directly subordinate to the Ministry of National Defense, per the Presidential Decree on Cyber Command enacted in that year). The Cyber Command’s duties include planning and executing cyber operations and related cybersecurity needs; developing and establishing frameworks necessary for cyber operations; and collecting, analyzing, and utilizing cyber threat intelligence (Presidential Decree on Cyber Command, Article 2). In addition, the Defense Counterintelligence Command under the MND supports cyber defense and information warfare (Presidential Decree on the Defense Counterintelligence Command, Article 4(5)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s governmental structure for cybersecurity is illustrated in the graphic below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-us-approach-and-defend-forward&quot;&gt;The U.S. Approach and Defend Forward&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crux of proactiveness in the United States’ cyber defense is reflected in the “Defend Forward” posture. In 2018, the year after President Donald Trump began his first term in office, the DOD’s cyber strategy introduced Defend Forward, which represented a new approach: the idea of moving as close as possible to the origin of an adversary’s activity as a way of defending against it. Defend Forward was first introduced in the 2018 vision document of the U.S. Cyber Command: Achieve and Maintain Cyberspace Superiority: Command Vision for US Cyber Command. According to the document, the United States will defend forward to disrupt and stop malicious cyber operations—including activities below the level of armed conflict—at their origin. The United States emphasizes that although Defend Forward involves activities on the adversary’s network and not the U.S. network, this is still a defensive activity, not an offensive one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defend Forward is inextricably linked to the concept of persistent engagement. The United States introduced the philosophy of persistent engagement in recognition of the fact that Cyber Command needs to engage with enemies on an ongoing basis in order to disrupt or impair their capabilities. The goal of persistent engagement is to identify and stop overseas cyber threats before they reach the U.S. network. Persistent engagement is designed to ensure that Cyber Command’s Cyber National Mission Force takes and maintains the initiative to succeed in the daily competition with enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spirit of Defend Forward and persistent engagement is reflected in a metaphor from General Paul Nakasone, former commander of U.S. Cyber Command: “Our naval forces do not defend by staying in port, and our airpower does not remain at airfields. They patrol the seas and skies to ensure they are positioned to defend our country before our borders are crossed. The same logic applies in cyberspace.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration continuously adopted Defend Forward under Pillar II (“Disrupt and Dismantle Threat Actors”) of its 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy. The strategic tasks in Pillar II aim to mobilize all powers to prevent malicious cyber actors from threatening national security and public safety. The United States elaborated that it would expand private sector participation in neutralizing malicious cyber activities and promote cooperation with international partners. The DOD signaled that, in line with the 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy, it will continuously defend forward by disrupting the malicious cyber activities and degrading their supporting ecosystems. (In the same year, General Nakasone stated that “There was a huge inflection point in 2018 with the Defend Forward [strategy]. I don’t see, necessarily, a huge change in the strategy coming out.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rok-and-us-cyber-defense-approaches-differences-and-commonalities&quot;&gt;ROK and U.S. Cyber Defense Approaches: Differences and Commonalities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are both shared features and divergences between the proactive cyber defense approaches of the ROK and the United States. In order to identify possible areas for cooperation between the two countries, these commonalities and differences need to be analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Differences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the U.S. and South Korean approaches have different backgrounds. One of the underlying reasons for the United States’ paradigm shift toward a proactive posture is the failure of the U.S. cyber deterrence strategy prior to 2018. In early cybersecurity strategy formulations, the United States primarily perceived acts that reached the use-of-force threshold as severe cyber threats. However, the malicious cyber operations to that point—such as the 2014 Sony Hack, the OPM breach, and the DNC hack—had been below the level of use of force. Minor but frequently occurring cyber incidents, meanwhile, had been neglected but were having cumulative and erosive impacts on national security. Recognizing this threat landscape, the United States devised the strategies of Defend Forward and persistent engagement in order to contest daily competition in cyberspace. In contrast, South Korea’s embrace of a proactive stance is not rooted in such reflection. Rather, South Korea took note of the inherent nature of cyber threats. In short, the hyper-connectedness of cyberspace makes complete prevention and defense against cyber threats too constrained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the origin of South Korea’s approach, it is evident that the major threats the country has experienced are not at or above the level of use of force. For instance, in May 2024, one terabyte of data from South Korea’s Supreme Court was stolen by Lazarus, North Korea’s hacking group. Yet physical and tangible damage—which would normally be calculated to assess whether an incident justifies use of force—was not caused. However, significantly sensitive personal information was leaked, including information on resident registration, marriage, and medical certificates. These types of damage could have a knock-on impact that could threaten national security. Accordingly, South Korea’s cyber defense posture must be calibrated to adequately disrupt such low-level activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, leadership frameworks for defending proactively also differ between the two countries. In the United States, a single leader serves as the director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the commander of the U.S. Cyber Command. This dual-hatted leader coordinates Defend Forward operations by integrating intelligence. However, the roles of the South Korean NIS and Cyber Command are not integrated for the purpose of proactive cyber defense. Although the NIS’s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) can operate a consolidated response system in which public and private entities can cooperate to manage and respond to crises (Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, Article 6 bis (4)), this framework is primarily crisis-based, requiring a certain threshold to operate. In addition, the NIS and Cyber Command are entitled to engage in proactive defense separately under national law, although cybersecurity intelligence can be shared between them (Regulation on Cybersecurity Duty, Article 5). As a result, who takes the lead in proactive defense and how the authorities cooperate is not well-defined in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commonalities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both countries, intelligence collection on cyber threat sources is key for successful proactive defense. Gathering intelligence—thereby gaining insights on adversaries’ weaknesses, intentions, and capabilities—is a crucial step for defending forward as close as possible to the origin of adversary activity. In its 2024 strategy, South Korea also highlighted an intent to bolster reconnaissance and intelligence on the sources of cyberattacks. Preemptively catching indications of malicious activities by detecting and analyzing sources is underlined as one of the subtasks of proactive cyber defense. By proactively discovering adversaries’ malware and tactics and degrading their capabilities to conduct malicious cyber operations, South Korea and the United States could prevent such activities at the source before reaching their networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If threat hunting is limited within one nation’s border, the success of proactive defense is limited as well. A proactive defense posture thus necessitates partnering with foreign countries. Indeed, the United States’ Defend Forward requires the country to conduct activities outside of U.S. networks—both in allies’ and partners’ networks and in those of adversaries. Thus, the U.S. Cyber Command views partnerships as an integral component of Defend Forward. In this vein, hunt forward operations—defensive cyber operations conducted at the invitation of a host nation—must be highlighted. Upon invitation, the U.S. Cyber Command’s Cyber National Mission Force deploys a team to a host country to observe and detect malicious cyber operations there. As of March 2023, hunt forward teams had been deployed on at least 47 missions in more than 20 countries. With a view toward enhancing capabilities to collect and analyze threat intelligence, South Korea is planning to expand the exchange of threat intelligence with foreign intelligence agencies. Compared to the United States’ rich experience in partnering with other countries for proactive cyber defense, including in hunt forward operations, South Korea has limited experience in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operationalizing-cooperation-for-proactive-cyber-defense&quot;&gt;Operationalizing Cooperation for Proactive Cyber Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ROK-U.S. Alliance and Proactive Cyber Defense&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this moment, many uncertainties hang over the alliance between South Korea and the United States, as well as the paths of their respective national cybersecurity strategies. President Trump has commenced his second term in the White House and is reshaping his country’s cybersecurity resources. South Korea is currently standing in the fog of uncertainty created by this political transition. Many have cast doubts on President Trump’s willingness to promote U.S. alliances, including the partnership with South Korea. Furthermore, experts have been raising concerns that the absence of leadership in South Korea will put the ROK-U.S. alliance in peril.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the following two principles cannot be reversed. First, the principle that the ROK-U.S. alliance applies to cyberspace must stand. Fortunately, South Korea and the United States still seem to share a common understanding that their alliance—which has lasted over 70 years—must be sustained. The foreign ministers from Seoul and Tokyo and the U.S. secretary of state met in February 2025 and discussed the necessity of enhancing the strength of their countries’ alliances to ensure peace and prosperity. In addition, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to strengthening extended deterrence cooperation through the ROK-U.S. and Japan-U.S. alliances. In this vein, the Strategic Cybersecurity Cooperation Framework (SCCF), a legacy of President Yoon and President Biden, must be underscored. On April 26, 2023, the two presidents created the SCCF, signaling their agreement that the ROK-U.S. alliance applies to cyberspace. Whatever the cooperation framework, South Korea and the United States must consider this a cardinal principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the proactive posture in cyber defense must not be abandoned. Strategic thinking evolves as cyber threats evolve; accordingly, defense has been evolving from reactive to proactive as countries adapt to the nature of cyberspace. In the words of cybersecurity experts Eric Talbot Jensen and Sean Watts, “cyberspace’s structural feature of interconnectedness and its core condition of constant contact creates a strategic necessity to operate continuously in cyberspace.” This means, as General Nakasone has put it, that we must not just “wait for cyber attacks to affect” our networks. In effect, it is hard to imagine that the United States and South Korea would abandon their proactive postures and reassume reactive postures, since this would go against the evolution of strategic thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laying Out South Korea’s Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the previous analysis of the similarities and differences between the two nations’ proactive approaches, this paper suggests five major considerations for South Korea to prioritize in its cooperation with the United States. Some of these are intended for both countries, while others are priorities specifically on the South Korean side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the two nations need to think about a suitable cooperation framework for proactive cyber defense. Under the SCCF, the two countries undertook discussions of how the Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States and the Republic of Korea (MDT) applies in cyberspace. When it comes to the two countries’ cooperation on proactive cyber defense, however, the MDT’s role would be limited. That is because the provisions under the MDT largely address armed attack situations. The treaty contains only six articles that strengthen the two countries’ efforts for collective defense. Article I outlines the two countries’ commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes and non-use of force, echoing the corresponding principles under the UN Charter. Articles II and III touch upon the two countries’ cooperation when one or both are threatened by an armed attack. Article IV regulates the right to deploy U.S. forces in the territory of South Korea. The final two articles contain miscellaneous provisions on ratification, entry into force, and termination of the treaty. As illustrated earlier in this paper, proactive defense posture has been introduced in national policy mainly due to cyber threats occurring below the use-of-force threshold. Of course, proactive cyber defense is not exclusive to low-level threats, but its necessity is most pronounced at that level. Consequently, South Korea and the United States need to pursue a cooperation mechanism that enables them to proactively defend against malicious operations, including those posed below the use-of-force level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, South Korea and the United States need to define the main threat actors against which they intend to proactively defend each other. According to the 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy, South Korea is mainly introducing an offensive response directed at threats from North Korea. Unfortunately, the real threat landscape is a bit different. For instance, pro-Russian cyber actors conducted distributed denial-of-service (DDos) attacks against ROK governmental websites, including that of the MND, after North Korea dispatched troops to Russia. In addition, damage caused by China’s cyber operations has been increasingly acknowledged as severe. Whether or not to explicitly indicate threat actors in a policy document depends upon a nation’s strategic calculations. South Korea and the United States, however, must identify and agree upon a common threat actor against whom proactive defense can be meaningfully employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To identify common threat actors, South Korea and the United States should be able to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of proactive defense measures against these threat actors, considering diverse elements like infrastructure footprints, geopolitical relations, and technical capabilities. Based on such assessments, South Korea and the United States could pinpoint shared threat actors against which collaborative proactive defense would yield a successful impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, South Korea and the United States must discuss how to successfully build collective inoculations of their networks. Proactive cyber defense aims to defend against malicious acts before they impact a country’s networks; to achieve such a goal, technical capabilities must be geared up well and outputs of technical analysis must be appropriately shared. At times, such technical measures for proactive hunting must be disseminated worldwide. To this end, cybersecurity advisories can be useful. By inoculating their own networks or global networks, the two countries can compete with malicious actors under more favorable conditions. Accordingly, South Korea and the United States must engage in dialogue on how to collaboratively raise their own technical capabilities and share these capabilities with the world for proactive defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, South Korea needs to rearrange its organizational framework for proactive defense and efficient intelligence sharing. Although the U.S. NSA and Cyber Command have different roles in national cybersecurity, they are directed by a single leader. This allows the United States to speedily leverage threat intelligence in cyber operations like Defend Forward. Moreover, the outputs of the command’s work during hunt forward operations are appropriately shared with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security, and private companies. Releasing adversaries’ malware obtained during hunt forward missions to the cybersecurity community makes that malware less effective because reactive defense can be used to detect and defeat it. In this way, the United States’ proactive cyber defense can inoculate U.S. networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, measures for proactive cyber defense are not carried out within one integrated framework. The NIS and Cyber Command are entitled to engage in proactive defense separately under national law. The consolidated response framework led by the NIS’s NCSC, in which public and private entities can cooperate, functions primarily on a crisis base. This organizational framework may hinder timely intelligence sharing among relevant agencies and private entities. Considering the advantages of the United States’ dual-hat leadership and its extensive experience in intelligence sharing, South Korea’s organizational structure must be reexamined and coordinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, the legal limitations of proactive cyber defense must be explored. Proactive cyber defense entails actively detecting and analyzing the sources of malicious cyber activities. Unfortunately, these sources are physically located in other countries’ territories and subject to the sovereignty of these states. Even though the international community has not reached a common understanding of how and when a state’s territorial sovereignty can be breached through activities in cyberspace, South Korea needs to engage in proactive defense activities within these legal considerations. In this vein, South Korea may gain lessons from the United States’ “away game” experiences (operations that, like Defend Forward, involve activities outside U.S. networks). The United States’ experiences in away games are richer than those of other countries, and some of them are publicly available, with details of successful cases sometimes disclosed. South Korea may reference the United States’ legal logic in such situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As cyber threats evolve, the tools that states devise in response evolve accordingly. Proactive cyber defense is a tool that is well-adapted to cyberspace’s inherent features and threats. South Korea introduced a proactive defense posture in its 2024 National Cybersecurity Strategy, with an ultimate goal similar to the United States’ Defend Forward. The concept of proactive cyber defense requires cooperation among states, as it requires tracking traces left by malicious actors globally. Given this landscape, cooperation with the United States—the most experienced country in proactive defense—is imperative for South Korea. In conclusion, this paper, as suggested above, proposes five key areas for the two nations’ cooperation to promote proactive cyber defense. South Korea and the United States need to (i) establish a suitable cooperation framework for proactive cyber defense; (ii) define the main threat actors against which they intend to proactively defend each other; and (iii) discuss how to successfully build collective inoculations of their networks. Furthermore, South Korea needs to: (i) rearrange its organizational framework for proactive defense and efficient intelligence sharing and (ii) explore the legal limitations of proactive cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

But the window of opportunity is closing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American disengagement from Ukraine has prompted European leaders to reaffirm their commitment to supporting Kyiv and emphasise the high stakes for European security. Nevertheless, European capitals are pessimistic about what can be achieved without significant American backing. In the absence of a clear European theory of victory, policy remains aimed at delaying Ukraine’s defeat without a clear vision of what Europe should be trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet a concerted effort by European states over the next year could lay the foundations for the enduring security of Europe; pushing Russia to a point where it will struggle to reconstitute its military sufficiently to threaten NATO for the foreseeable future. There is a closing window of opportunity within which a more dangerous future for the continent can be foreclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;europe-without-a-buffer-zone&quot;&gt;Europe Without a Buffer Zone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future that dominates planning within NATO is one in which Russia imposes an outcome on Kyiv, compromising Ukraine’s independence. Having withdrawn its forces from Ukraine to put them through large scale exercises, the Russians could have a minimum viable force to threaten European states in the context of US redeployments to the Indo-Pacific within two years. Rebuilding its officer corps given extensive losses will take up to seven years, over which time the Russian military will regenerate much of its frontline equipment, so that the severity of the threat that must be balanced by NATO increases with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukraine can hold on for another year, continuing to attrite Russian forces, however, then Russia may be pushed beyond its ability to readily recover. Russia is already approaching the exhaustion of its stockpiled Soviet-era armoured vehicles by the end of 2025. In 2026 the Russian Army will have to replace losses by producing new equipment. Recruitment is currently at an all-time high in Russia with between 35,000-47,000 people joining the military per month, but the bonuses needed to induce enlistment have peaked, while much of the enthusiasm to join has been driven by a perception that the war will soon be over. To keep up recruitment, Russia is already looking beyond voluntary enlistment. Russia cannot further increase payments as the Kremlin has emphasised that it will not be spending more on defence. If the war looks to be protracting, it will struggle to keep up the rate of recruitment. In terms of both equipment and personnel, the key to Russia’s ability to rebuild combat power is money, which is overwhelmingly generated through the oil and gas sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economic-hurdles-for-russian-forces&quot;&gt;Economic Hurdles for Russian Forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s exposure to disruption of oil and gas exports is significant. With sanctions restricting Russia’s ability to borrow on the international market, it cannot afford to run a sustained budget deficit. Following President Donald Trump’s raft of tariff announcements, the price of oil dropped below $60 a barrel – the level against which Russia’s budget is benchmarked – causing President Putin and his defence minister to emphasise in speeches that the military would need to work within their current means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe, however, has the capacity to significantly strain Russia’s finances and thus the sustainability of the war. Most of Russia’s oil exports are moved by sea, and over 60% of that traffic flows through the Baltic Sea where they must pass through Danish waters. Sanctioning vessels associated with this trade can cause them to be de-flagged and once de-flagged Denmark could ban them from transiting its waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia would invariably seek to export oil via other ports, but limitations on available infrastructure would still see a significant decline in exports. This could be further reduced through the threat of secondary sanction to ports that receive and offload Russian oil. Russian oil represents a small fraction of these ports’ business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s economy and thus its ability to sustain the war can be further degraded through Ukraine’s long-range precision strike campaign. Many of the sub-systems used in Ukraine’s manufacture of long-range weapons are European and Europe can invest to expand supply, enabling Ukraine to target a wider range of Russian infrastructure. Resourcing the strike campaign is in many ways a win-win scenario for Europe. If Russian air defences defeat the strikes, Russia burns through its stockpiles of surface to air missiles – thereby making the conventional deterrent offered by European air forces more credible – while if the strikes succeed, they both reduce Russian revenue and its capacity to build weaponry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These effects will take time to impact Russia, but if implemented with alacrity they would confront the Kremlin with hard policy trade-offs in 2026. It would, in short, provide the basis for bringing Russia to the table to negotiate, rather than simply playing at Potemkin peace-talks in which Russia restates its maximalists demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;holding-ground-to-buy-time&quot;&gt;Holding Ground to Buy Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is only possible if Ukraine can hold. At present, the rate of Russian advance is accelerating and Russia’s summer offensive is likely to put the Armed Forces of Ukraine under intense pressure. Nevertheless, most of the capabilities that Ukraine depends upon for its defence today – from drones to artillery and even aircraft – are not directly dependent upon the US. In the short-term Europe can cover most of Ukraine’s needs so long as it can purchase some critical weapons types from the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the medium-term Europe must address fundamental weaknesses in its defence industrial base. Investment in explosives and propellent production for instance is essential, as highlighted in the UK’s recent Strategic Defence Review. The good news is that this is critical to support Ukraine and to rebuild NATO’s conventional forces so investment in this area is not wasted irrespective of how the threat develops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that US disengagement makes Europe’s security more precarious has seen understandable efforts across the continent over the past five months to try and engage with Donald Trump. This has softened some of the administration’s more abrupt actions. But it has not altered the underlying trend that the US is going to pivot from Europe. It is time the continent crafts a vision for how it can underwrite its own security and put the steps in place to realise it. That vision begins in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past January, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation issued updated guidance about North Korea’s IT labour networks, noting that they “…have been observed using artificial intelligence and face-swapping technology during video job interviews to obfuscate their true identities.” Iran, too, is finding success in augmenting its global spear-phishing and social-engineering campaigns with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While banks and other financial institutions are increasingly supplementing their compliance and monitoring capabilities with AI, most are geared towards financial crime and sanctions evasion as it currently stands, not as it is heading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-once-was-a-question-of-emerging-technology-is-now-a-real-threat&quot;&gt;What Once was a Question of Emerging Technology is Now a Real Threat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is reshaping entire sectors of the global economy and changing how the world conducts business. Healthcare, manufacturing and finance, to name a few, stand to benefit from AI-enabled solutions that can make quick sense of complex data. The banking and finance sectors have been some of the earliest adopters, deploying AI tools to detect fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions evaders. According to one recent survey of financial leaders, nearly 77% of banks have adopted or plan to adopt AI tools to augment their fraud detection, risk and compliance functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, however, is that criminals, too, are rapidly deploying AI-enhanced tools, and with promising results. A recent study, for example, found that AI-enabled spear-phishing campaigns were nearly as effective as those generated by humans. Although exact figures are unknown, another survey suggests that a growing and significant number of fraud schemes involve the use of malicious AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rapidly evolving landscape presents a significant challenge for global sanctions implementation and enforcement. While financial institutions and governments have invested heavily in AI to detect illicit activities, the very same technology is now being weaponised by adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-radical-evolution-of-sanctions-evasion&quot;&gt;A Radical Evolution of Sanctions Evasion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past several decades, sanctions-evasion methods have generally followed similar patterns with little in the way of significant innovation. Both North Korea and Iran heavily rely on obfuscation methods like the use of shell and front companies, falsified documentation, such as end-user certificates, and third-party countries to get around US and international sanctions. Often these methods take advantage of legal and regulatory gaps in monitoring and enforcement (for example, the use of secrecy jurisdictions) or the adoption of novel technologies. North Korea, for example, has become prolific in its virtual currency theft operations that generate revenues for its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, How are Sanctions-Evaders Adopting AI?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one, AI can automate complex tasks, generate realistic deceptive content, and create layers of obfuscation that are significantly harder to penetrate. Most importantly, this can be accomplished at a scale and speed that most monitoring and enforcement mechanisms are unable to handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While conventional methods of sanctions evasion, such as the use of shell corporations, document falsification, and exploitation of offshore jurisdictions, remain prevalent, AI introduces a novelty and level of obfuscation that make detection far more difficult. Manually establishing and managing hundreds of interconnected shell companies, each with unique and non-overlapping details, is a monumental task prone to human error, which investigators often exploit. AI, however, can generate and manage vast networks of synthetic entities, complete with varied digital footprints, making them appear more distinct and significantly harder to link back to a common controlling interest – overwhelming traditional investigative techniques and rule-based detection systems, which are often designed to identify known patterns of illicit behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider, for example, that one of North Korea’s largest sanctions-busting networks, Ocean Maritime Management, consisted of dozens of shell companies registered in jurisdictions across the globe. AI-enabled systems could feasibly create hundreds, if not thousands, of such networks – all mathematically optimised to avoid monitoring and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just shady corporate structuring – malicious AI threatens all aspects of sanctions-evasion, including trade-based sanctions and export controls. Falsifying the nature, origin or destination of goods is a common tactic in trade-based money laundering and sanctions evasion. AI can be used offensively to analyse customs codes, tariff schedules and regulatory frameworks across multiple jurisdictions to identify the most effective and efficient ways to misclassify sanctioned goods or dual-use items to avoid detection or minimise duties. Furthermore, falsifying key shipping documents, such as bills of lading, certificates of origin and packing lists is a well-established method of sanctions evasion. Generative AI – a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content, such as text, images, videos and code based on user input – can produce convincing and internally consistent sets of fraudulent documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-anyone-ready-for-this&quot;&gt;Is Anyone Ready For This?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past month, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which is the global standard-setter for anti-money laundering, counterterrorist financing, and counterproliferation financing standards – released a report that provides important updates on the methods that WMD proliferation networks use to source dual-use goods and technologies and access the global financial system in contravention of international sanctions. Although the report acknowledges the potential threat of AI-enabled sanctions evasion, it notes the topic is “too nascent to draw conclusions”. Unfortunately, this lack of forward thinking may impinge global counterproliferation financing efforts. According to FATF, only 16% of countries assessed are deemed to have effectively implemented recommendations related to proliferation financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that governments, international organisations and private sector institutions currently are building and deploying AI-enabled solutions to look for sanctions-evasion now, and not how it is expected to evolve. The focus must adapt from looking for established red flags and typologies to anticipating adaptive, AI-driven obfuscation strategies that can learn from detection attempts and modify their tactics accordingly (in other words, adaptive adversarial AI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, however, several significant obstacles stand in the way of getting ahead of AI-enabled sanctions evasion. One is contending with outdated compliance and monitoring infrastructure across disparate sectors. Some jurisdictions, for example, still maintain paper-based customs monitoring systems. Many financial institutions, especially those in the developing world, still rely on individual reviews of suspicious activity. Such methods are highly vulnerable to AI-enabled attacks that can scale to levels that utterly overwhelm compliance, monitoring and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another is finding a balance between data privacy and consumer protection on the one hand and regulations that may hamper rapid adoption of AI-enabled tools on the other hand. The Financial Action Task Force, for example, found that while the use of AI can help “public and private sectors improve the effectiveness of their risk-based implementation of the FATF Standards” such tools must remain “compatible with international standards of data protection, privacy, and cybersecurity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some jurisdictions, regulatory approaches tend to be more sectoral, relying on existing authorities to address AI-related risks within their domains. The US, for example, remains a patchwork of regulations – often inconsistent from state to state and lacking overarching Federal regulations. While critics have claimed this approach threatens consumers, others have claimed that over-regulation would stifle innovation and adoption speed, threatening America’s economic positioning with the AI sector. The European Union has taken a decidedly different approach, with its landmark AI Act, which essentially establishes a risk-based framework for AI across industries and categorizes AI systems by risk level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the question for policymakers is whether regulation will hamper or enable the ability of monitoring and enforcement systems to keep pace with the evolution of sanctions evasion, driven by adversarial AI. What we know for sure is that the era of AI-enabled sanctions evasion is here, and those that police sanctions implementation and evasion need to fundamentally rethink how they respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the June 2025 war ended, it was the peak of conflict between Israel and Iran. Until 1979, the two states had mutually beneficial relations but following the Islamic revolution this conflict has existed between them. Iran has seen Israel as its nemesis. The Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei and many Iranian top officials do not recognise Israel’s right to exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict has been a top concern for Israel, which has been especially worried about Iran’s nuclear project. Over the years Israel had attempted to slow Iran’s nuclear program before it could produce nuclear weapons, by employing covert tactics such as cyber-attacks and assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders have been warning about the threat Iran imposes. It eventually brought this recent confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maj. General Eyal Zamir suggested in May 2022 a strategy against Iran. In the June 2025 war, as chief of staff, he led the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in a confrontation that started with a major Israeli attack. Israel’s spearhead was the Israeli Air Force (IAF) including its air defence, and Israel’s intelligence community. Israel launched two strikes inside Iran in 2024, which were not focused on Iran’s nuclear program but on Iran’s advanced antiaircraft batteries, the S-300, which were neutralised. Then, Israel sought a very short and limited round of confrontations. The June 2025 war was a much bigger campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran has allies and proxies across the Middle East, but Hezbollah and Hamas became much weaker after absorbing significant blows in 2024. Those groups were not involved in the more recent confrontation between Israel and Iran. The pro-Iranian groups in Iraq also stayed out of the war. Only the Houthis continued to confront Israel, but in a very limited way. The combination between the decline of Iran’s partners and the weakness of Iran’s air defences gave Israel a rare opportunity to strike. At the same time, Iran was closer than ever to producing nuclear weapons. Israel was concerned that it might be its last chance to stop Iran from having nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel managed to convince its American patron to allow Israel to hit Iran hard. The United States had provided Israel with highly valuable military and political support during the campaign and then, after more than a week of battles between Israel and Iran, the Trump administration bombed three Iranian nuclear sites. The United States had to take into account various constraints, on several levels, like the cost of the war, the need to save munitions for a possible fight with Russia and/or China, and to deal with domestic opposition to the US participating in the war – including inside the Trump administration. No wonder the United States had sought, and quite quickly managed, an end to the confrontation. Israel and Iran also had good reasons to avoid a long war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;israels-constraints&quot;&gt;Israel’s Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel has strong ties with its American patron, but the US – perhaps quite soon – may have pulled back from the June 2025 war. Israel did not want to be left alone during a tough fight with Iran. It required Israel to end the war soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel always tries to run a short war for several basic reasons, including economic ones. Israel’s economy is trying to recover from the long and highly costly war in Gaza (which costed Israel so far more than $67 billion). The June 2025 war had costed Israel hundreds of millions of dollars a day, and the cost of property damage in Israel was recently estimated at around $1.5 billion. Israel tried to adjust its economy according to the constraints of the confrontation. Yet Israel needed to end the war with Iran soon, or else its economy might have faced a major crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israelis have grown used to a state of emergency certainly since October 7, 2023, when Hamas and then Hezbollah confronted Israel. Those groups receive aid from Iran so they can fight Israel. The June 2025 war was directly between Israel and Iran. The Israeli public is exhausted after almost two years of war. They would have stood firm as long as the people believed the losses and damage they absorb are worth the outcome of the confrontation with Iran. If Israel had officially insisted its goal is to topple the Iranian regime, it would have been a tall order. The Iranian regime might have been strong enough to survive, and eventually the Israeli public would have therefore felt they are losing, in that sense. The same would have happened if the Israeli public were convinced Israel can quickly defeat Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are up to 15,000 Jews who live in Iran. They have not been harmed, but during the June 2025 war there was fear among them. If the confrontation had continued – and especially if it had escalated – the situation for Iranian Jews might have got worse. This negative change might not have been initiated by the Iranian regime, because it would have made the regime look bad, but some Iranians might have taken the law into their own hands to assault Jews. Outside the Middle East, as the war would have gone on, there would have been a growing risk that the Iranian regime or its supporters might have attacked Jewish communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel and the United States could have conducted more air strikes, adding to it raids with special forces and cyber-attacks. Israel also could have continued to assassinate leading Iranian nuclear scientists and top officials. Yet those efforts require a lot of resources and time and there is no guarantee they could have stopped Iran from producing nuclear weapons. Israel, sometimes together with the United States, already tried many of those methods during the last two decades, which only delayed Iran’s nuclear program. Israel could have also tried to assist the Iranian opposition to bring regime change in Iran, which is a complicated task that would too require a long time, and might not succeed. President Trump suggested the possibility of regime change in Iran. However, the United States might hesitate here, following its bitter experience in trying regime change in Iran’s neighbours, Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran is more than 1,500 km away from Israel. The IAF reaches Iran, but the IAF was built to fight near Israel, not far away. Israel’s fighter-bombers: the F-15, F-16 and F-35 can use drop tanks, but the IAF needs tankers for a long fight. The IAF has a half-century-old Ram (Boeing 707) tanker aircraft that had conduced around 600 aerial refuelling missions during the recent confrontation. Yet since they were too few of those tankers some Israeli aircraft were refuelled by US tankers. Israel seeks to get the new Boeing KC-46 tankers, but before they arrive, the IAF would have struggled to keep a high rate of sorties over Iran in the long run, without significant US assistance. In addition, despite the IAF’s impressive efforts to maintain its aircraft, the IAF must operate following almost two years of fighting, with all its demands on the IAF. Its fighter-bombers are sophisticated and complicated weapon systems, but some of them have been in service for two decades or more, which could make it a challenge to keep them operational if the fight with Iran had been prolonged. Israel had to be careful not to wear down the IAF in a long confrontation with Iran, particularly if in the near future Israel faces a sudden and severe crisis, let alone a war on another front. The IAF would still have been able to fight, but the IAF would have been weaker, which might have made it difficult for the IDF to win at a low cost. Meanwhile, it is possible, if the confrontation with Iran had gone on for months, eventually one or more Israeli aircraft might have been lost. If an Israeli air crew had to abandon its plane because of Iranian anti-aircraft fire, lack of fuel, technical problems or some accident, this crew might have ended up in Iranian hands, which would have been a blow to Israeli morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IAF does not have heavy bombers so there is a limit to how much damage the IAF could inflict. It is another important constraint in a long war. The IAF would also need all kinds of bombs if the fight had gone on. Recently the Director General of the Ministry of Defense, Maj. Gen. (res.) Amir Baram, met with the CEOs of the main defence industries and top officials from the Ministry of Defense. They discussed accelerating the production of key munition needed for a long campaign. Yet there are limits to how many bombs – or the materials to make them – Israel can produce or import. The same is true with the Israeli air defence, which might have ran out of Arrow missiles as the fight had continued. Israel might have had a serious munitions shortage, despite all the US aid in this matter. Although Iran is Israel’s main enemy, the IDF cannot spend too much ammunition in fighting Iran. Some reserve must be saved in case there is a confrontation on another front. After Israel was shocked on October 7, 2023, it must be ready for other nasty surprises that might lead to a war. The United States too has similar considerations, which can delay or reduce the amount of munitions it can deliver to Israel. The US military already has munitions shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is strategic, economic and military constraints would have made it hard for Israel to handle a long war, which could have happened, especially if Israel’s goals were not practical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;irans-calculations&quot;&gt;Iran’s Calculations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran has much more territory, population and natural resources than Israel. Israel’s size is around 22,000 km2 and it has 10 million people while Iran’s is more than 1,600,000 km2 and has around 90 million people and enormous natural gas and oil reserves. Israel’s gas reserves are much smaller. Despite all those advantages, Iran would have struggled to run a long fight due to several factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran could not have been sure if, when, and how much the United States would have continued to strike Iran. President Trump might have assumed Iran is so weak, that he can force it to do what he wants, by continuing to bomb it. Trump also did not forget Iran tried to assassinate him. An ongoing, let alone massive, US offensive against Iran would have changed the power of balance against Iran. Iran had to prevent that by ending the confrontation before it would have been too late for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranian regime might have been desperate enough, if the war had gone on, to try to close the Strait of Hormuz, where around 20 million barrels of oil pass per day, which is about 20% of global petroleum liquids consumption. Blocking those straits would seriously disrupt the oil market. The United States could break this siege by force and retaliate against Iran. This fight would have started with the Strait of Hormuz, but it could have expanded into a bigger fight that would have included striking targets all over Iran such as its nuclear sites. Over time, such escalation could have jeopardised the survival of the Iranian regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IAF gained air superiority over Iran’s skies. Iran’s air force is old and cannot match the IAF. The IAF also neutralised a large part of Iran’s air defence. Iran could not have afforded a long war in which Israel can bomb in Iran whenever and whatever it wants. This enormous advantage would have allowed Israel to strike various targets including going after senior officials, up to the supreme leader. This was a huge risk for the regime, that also humiliated it in the eyes of its people, which increased the danger they might topple it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran strikes Israel with drones, but in the last two years the IAF has gained experience in shooting them down, which was evident in the success in this action by the IDF in the June 2025 war. Iran’s main weapon, their surface-to-surface missiles, caused some casualties and damage but Israel began to destroy the launchers. To begin with, Iran had less than 2,000 missiles that could reach Israel and far fewer launchers. Since the IAF had control over the skies of Iran, despite Iran being a huge country, the IAF was able to find and hit those launchers with increasing efficacy. Iran was aware it had to end the war before it was unable to strike Israel with missiles, and by the end of the confrontation Iran was firing far fewer missiles than at the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran’s economy depends on exporting oil. If Israel had severely crippled Iran’s oil production, Iran could have sold much less oil. For Iran, it was a very good reason to stop the war before this happens. Furthermore, the Iranian economy has been struggling for many years now, not only because of sanctions but also due to corruption, mismanagement and giving priority to foreign adventurers instead of taking care of the Iranian population. Iran has to manage enormous economic challenges such as an energy crisis, while Iran’s currency, the Rial, is at an all-time low. The Iranian regime was aware that if its economy deteriorates even more, due to losing its main income through the difficulty of selling oil, it will increase the probability of an uprising. In recent years there were several waves of demonstrations in Iran. Another outburst might be powerful enough to undermine the Iranian regime. Preventing this requires the Iranian regime to focus on improving its economy by making reforms and removing sanctions, which meant ending the war soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the confrontation had continued, European powers that signed the JCPOA might have suspected that Iran would try, secretly or not, to produce nuclear weapons after or even during the war, to protect itself from attacks. This would have raised the chances that in October, the ‘snapback’ mechanism might be implemented, reinstating UN sanctions against Iran. It was another key economic concern for Iran, adding to the pressure on her to end the war quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, from the perspective of the Iranian regime, they made huge compromises in 1988, ending the war with Iraq, and in 2015, signing the JCPOA, and they have now done another by ending the war – before the cost would have been too high for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian foreign policy, traditionally nonpartisan, is increasingly shaped by domestic political divides, complicating alignment with global powers. This also fuels unpredictability, especially in relation to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil’s political right is looking to align with Washington in a bipolar world order, while its political left still seeks multipolarity through the Global South and with the help of the Global East. If, contrary to many expectations and current Brazilian policy, the world becomes bipolar, Brazil may be forced to pick sides, challenging its tradition of balanced diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the world appears to be heading towards multipolarity, this would fulfil a long-held Brazilian foreign policy objective. However, Brazil faces regional dynamics that, perhaps paradoxically, resemble bipolarity, as South America remains only a secondary, or even tertiary, zone for great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosting major forums like the G20, BRICS, and COP30 puts pressure on Brazil to deliver more consistent global messaging, limiting its room for strategic flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 6–7 July, the BRICS Summit will be held on Brazil’s southeastern coast, in Rio de Janeiro, sandwiched between last November’s G20 Summit in the same city and this November’s COP Summit in the Amazonian city of Belém. Brazil’s role in presiding over leading fora of multilateral diplomacy draws attention to different facets of left-wing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s policy. Lula, now serving his third term as president, has positioned Brazil as a vocal advocate for climate action, Global South cooperation, and a more multipolar world order. These platforms offer his government a chance to demonstrate global leadership and score some wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Briefing Paper examines whether Brazil’s traditional approach – marrying the abovementioned foreign policy positions with basic alignment with the United States – remains sustainable in the face of today’s shifting global dynamics. The challenge lies not only in balancing between two powers – the US and China – but also in navigating two different international structures, bipolarity and multipolarity, at both global and regional levels. Adding to the complexity, Brazil’s outlook is also subject to major swings due to the increasingly partisan slant in its foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis is divided into four parts. First, Brazil’s current push for multipolarity is addressed. Second, the development of a distinctly Brazilian foreign policy vision is outlined, particularly in the context of its evolving relationship with the United States and its views on Brazil’s hemispheric and global roles. Third, this vision is examined in light of Brazil’s current objective of global multipolarity – particularly through BRICS – and its preference for multilateralism in settings such as the UN and its climate regime, the WTO, and the G20. This is also compared with India’s behaviour on both regional and global stages. Fourth, the sustainability of Brazil’s current path is assessed: a path that entails keeping Washington close enough while simultaneously pursuing a world that is not necessarily aligned with US interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil currently faces both ample opportunities for diverse partnerships and challenges in avoiding open alignment. As much as Brazil may have publicly pushed for reforming international institutions, it has been a relative beneficiary of the pre-existing rules-based order and a less divided world. Thus, this analysis concludes with the conjecture that other global powers will find it increasingly difficult to comprehend the ambiguity of Brazil’s alignment, and that Brazil itself may struggle to maintain its balancing act. European actors, in particular, would do well to study Brazil’s experience closely, both as a warning and as a model, to avoid repeating missteps or overlooking structural tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brazils-push-for-multipolarity&quot;&gt;Brazil’s push for multipolarity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil’s 2025 BRICS presidency got off to a flying start in January, when Indonesia joined the organization. With its 280 million people and $1.4 trillion GDP, Indonesia strengthens Brazil’s pursuit of multipolarity and its multi-aligned stance in global affairs. For Brasília, Jakarta’s accession marked a major diplomatic win and underscored Brazil’s emphasis on BRICS as a framework for cooperation in the Global South – a Global South in which Brazil sees itself as a, or the, major leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet BRICS remains divided on its basic orientation. Russia, Iran, and China openly challenge the Western-led international order, while Indonesia has now joined India and Brazil as a major multi-aligned member, one that emphasises strategic autonomy. This underlines the bloc’s strikingly diverse composition, which also includes Egypt and the United Arab Emirates – both close strategic allies of the US – while South Africa and Ethiopia, which are currently suffering from cooling relations with the United States, are the final two of the group’s fully declared ten members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia is a case in point when discussing the strategic ambiguity surrounding the group. While Brazil refers to Saudi Arabia as a member, Riyadh has neither accepted nor declined the invitation to join. For Saudi Arabia – as well as for many other BRICS partners and applicants – ambiguity remains a strategic hedge in an evolving world order. Nonetheless, the current BRICS members already account for a higher share of global GDP in terms of purchasing power parity terms than the G7 core. To make matters more interesting, this shift comes at a time when this Western rival to BRICS appears increasingly divided, as seen in its June summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This growing juxtaposition between BRICS and the G7 raises broader questions about the structure of the international system. Brazil’s role in BRICS depends not just on the country’s partnerships, but also on how power is distributed globally. A central tension emerges here: is the world heading towards multipolarity or bipolarity? Although not taking a definitive stance on the question, this paper examines how countries may need to prepare for both scenarios. For Brazil, this question is particularly pressing, as in a more multipolar world, it may aspire to emerge as a pole of its own; in a bipolar world, it may have to choose, or at least balance, between two superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this analysis, bipolarity refers to a global or regional system defined and driven by two countries. At the global level, for example, even the rapprochement between the United States and Russia can be seen as a sign of such bipolarity, as Washington seeks an understanding with Moscow that would allow it to focus more energy on Beijing. However, the very existence of such a Muscovite lever – one with the world’s largest arsenal of nuclear weapons – suggests a considerable element of multipolarity in the emerging global order, where power is distributed among several influential states rather than concentrated in two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional dynamics complicate the picture further, as the structure of the international system can appear very different depending on the perspective. For example, India is situated at the heart of multipolarity, both in the Indo-Pacific and in Eurasia. Brazil, by contrast, is geographically removed from the hottest spots of geopolitical contestation. As a result, it is more vulnerable to the pressures of systemic bipolarity than countries located in regions shaped by several great powers. This means that Brazil must actively seek out and build multipolarity, pursuing partnerships with other actors, including parties such as the European Union. While doing so, it must also follow a path that reconciles its global ambitions with domestic and regional constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brazil-the-us-and-the-quest-for-global-status&quot;&gt;Brazil, the US, and the quest for global status&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand Brazil’s amorphous ambitions for global leadership, it is first necessary to comprehend how its relationship with the United States has evolved. Beneath the surface of Brazil’s foreign policy discourse lies an undercurrent of jealousy that has the potential to turn into resentment: Why them and not us? Both countries are continental in scale, and Brazil also entered modernity in overdrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the Napoleonic Wars, Brazil was merely a Portuguese colony, lacking even a printing press. Then, from 1808 to 1821, the Portuguese Court ruled from Rio de Janeiro. In 1822, Brazil gained independence under an emperor, the son of the King of Portugal. The resulting Empire of Brazil had two overarching policy objectives: actualizing territorial integrity and preserving slavery in the New World, even after European kingdoms turned against the slave trade. In 1889, Brazil abolished slavery and emerged as an aristocratic republic with a predilection for localized civil war, but also continued territorial expansion, especially in the Amazon region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Brazil fought on the side of the Allies in World War I and took part in the League of Nations, its foreign policy remained largely focused on internal and regional affairs. A more multifaceted approach began to emerge in the mid-to-late 1930s, co-created with Washington in the context of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Good Neighbor Policy. Roosevelt sought a partnership with Brazil, soon convinced the country to join World War II, and in 1947, President Harry Truman signed the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance. Known as the Rio Treaty, it formalized collective defence in the Americas and helped inspire the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an auspicious decade for both US-Brazil relations and Brazil’s rise as a global player. However, from the perspective of then-capital Rio de Janeiro, one crucial shortcoming stood out: Brazil failed to secure a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Despite early US support, Brazil lacked the international recognition needed to secure the seat. This failure has shaped Brazil’s foreign policy ever since. Why did the quest fail, and how could that wrong be rectified?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quest for global status via a permanent seat on the UNSC has remained, on and off, a mainstay of Brazil’s foreign policy vision. Similarly, its relationship with the United States – with the bicentennial of diplomatic ties celebrated in 2024 – has remained a constant, if sometimes one-sided, question. Washington’s view of Brazil has shifted over time: at certain points, the US has hoped that Brazil would play a more prominent role in South America or the broader Americas, and at other times, it has found Brazil’s efforts, at best, a hindrance to its own goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proximity has not always bred harmony, and during the Cold War, for example, bilateral ties were often controversial. One notable episode was Brazil’s participation, during its military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985, in the US-led intervention in the Dominican Republic. The relationship between the two great federal republics of the Americas has alternated between cooperation and phases of Brazilian assertiveness, including the pursuit of an autonomous foreign policy and regional leadership, if not against, then at least not for the purposes of the United States. The latter tendencies were particularly pronounced during the eight years of the first and second Lula presidencies (2003–2010).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 21st century, Brazilian foreign policy has taken an increasingly partisan turn. In recent years, the country’s political right has seen itself aligning with the United States bilaterally. For example, under hard-right President Jair Bolsonaro from 2019 to 2022, the last Trump administration designated Brazil a Major Non-NATO Ally. By contrast, Lula’s return to office has created more distance between Brasília and Washington, even though President Joe Biden intervened to help secure the Brazilian election in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With hardening partisanship, Brazil’s foreign policy vision is becoming increasingly complex. It is also shaped by the rise of a near-peer rival to the United States – China – and several international regimes built around Beijing. The most important of these is BRICS, an organization whose future is essential to Brazil’s grand strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet there is a risk. To avoid being seen as openly aligned against the United States, Brazil must succeed in portraying its BRICS engagement as cooperation within the Global South, rather than as an anteroom for entering the Global East – the bloc of countries openly challenging the United States and many of its friends and allies. As a pair of shrewd analysts have put it, the outcome of the ongoing battle for the direction of BRICS will help determine the future of the global order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brazil-in-brics-and-beyond&quot;&gt;Brazil in BRICS and beyond&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Global South has arguably been among the greatest beneficiaries of the last quarter – if not the last half – of a century of globalization. While many countries commonly regarded as part of the Global South still struggled with a myriad of financial crises at the turn of the millennium, many of them have now not only secured seats at the tables where international policy is made but also built alternatives to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, it is useful to distinguish between the Global South, which may not be part of the Global West or North, but does not necessarily seek to challenge them, and the Global East, which increasingly does. This distinction is important for two reasons: first, there is overlap in membership between the two groups; and second, the Global East has arguably been the greatest winner of the 21st century. China’s growth is already legendary, but even under wartime sanctions, Russia’s economy has proven remarkably resilient. In recent years, the Global East has shifted from simply growing its share of the global economic pie to translating economic gains into geostrategic capabilities – a shift that has not gone unnoticed in European capitals, much less in Washington. From the first Trump administration through Joe Biden’s four years in office, the United States has sought to hamper the economic growth of not only its clear foes such as Russia, Iran, and North Korea, but also, increasingly, that of its principal systemic challenger: China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complicate matters further, leading lights in Washington now see even the prosperity of many longstanding allies as something of a threat. This signals a shift towards a more confrontational understanding of global power and creates a challenging scenario for Brasília, regardless of who is in power – and even despite Brazil’s trade surplus with the United States. In response, President Lula has insisted that BRICS is not aimed against anyone, and therefore no country should have any reason to turn down an invitation or use the organization to its own advantage. However, others seem to see things differently. Saudi Arabia’s fence-sitting is one example, but Argentina’s outright refusal to accept an invitation to join in 2023 – following the electoral victory of Javier Milei, a right-wing president aligning the country more closely with the United States – suggests that some governments do indeed see BRICS as politically charged, or as standing in opposition to Washington and allied capitals. This also speaks to the evolution of BRIC into the so-called BRICS+, with the plus sign symbolising not only growing membership, but also expanded ambition. What began as a forum for those seeking simple recognition has evolved into economic cooperation and increasingly ventured into the realm of geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While both Brazil and India have at times resisted the expansion of BRICS and its overt geopoliticization, they have ultimately chosen to remain within the changing organization – or perhaps concluded that they have nowhere else to go. For Brazil, this became particularly apparent during its G20 presidency in 2024. Although it managed to highlight poverty and hunger – and even build an alliance around these issues – it achieved little in terms of furthering the reform of international institutions. In contrast, Brazil has devoted more of its international efforts in 2025 to BRICS, a platform increasingly associated with a more confrontational stance towards the Global West or North. The contrast is telling: as such, the G20, born of the Global Financial Crisis and an institution that has sought to balance a variety of interests, may be turning into a relic of High Globalization. BRICS, by comparison, reflects a more disruptive vision for global governance. If the G7 has continued to exist alongside the G20, then why not BRICS?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps paradoxically, emerging multipolarity, at least at the regional level, seems to be challenging multilateral governance frameworks. Brazil and India – both prominent actors in the Global South and founding members of BRICS – offer contrasting examples. While Brazil, located in a relatively peaceful area, has largely existed in a region shaped by bipolar great power dynamics – with China steadily displacing the United States in areas such as trade and finance – India is living through multipolarity in its region, surrounded by multiple nuclear-armed rivals. This is perhaps why both US and European policymakers have expressed more empathy towards India’s strategy of multi-alignment. In a tougher neighbourhood, New Delhi’s balancing strategy is approached with more understanding than Brazil’s, even when it blends increasing military cooperation with the United States with military-industrial and energy engagement with Russia, and a generally sceptical approach to world-trade regimes. Meanwhile, Brazil, despite its support for multilateralism and participation in institutions like the WTO, is afforded less leeway – even though it has clearly condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, despite some odd remarks from its presidents. Compounding this, Brazil’s economic performance has lagged, while India is on a path to overtake Japan as the world’s fourth-largest economy, possibly as early as 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Brazil’s past role as a potential bridge between the West and the Global South has become less plausible in a world where the West itself is more divided and where the United States has, once again, withdrawn from the Paris Agreement. This matters because, in late 2025, Brazil will also host the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, an event intended to showcase its global climate leadership. Climate diplomacy has been a central part of Brazil’s multilateral identity ever since the Rio Conventions of 1992, although the Lula government’s sustainability commitments are in tension with its interest in expanding fossil fuel exploration – including in areas near Belém, at the mouth of the Amazon River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these contradictions, Brasília’s intention is to double down on Brazil’s legacy of leadership through multilateralism and to re-emphasise sustainability. The inclusion of Indonesia in BRICS during the first days of Brazil’s presidency suggests that its leadership in the Global South can also yield tangible results. Brasília, indeed, seems capable of moulding the world in a direction it desires. Whether that direction aligns with Washington or other Western capitals is another matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions-between-alignment-and-autonomy&quot;&gt;Conclusions: Between alignment and autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can Brazil simultaneously maintain sufficient alignment with the United States while also pursuing an increasingly independent stance in the region and the world? Answers to this question are becoming increasingly contradictory and contentious. Yet Brazil’s relationship with the United States continues to influence its aspirations for both regional and global leadership. Ultimately, Brazil still needs Washington’s vote for a hypothetical permanent seat on the UNSC, and more immediately, Brasília’s interests lie in avoiding alarm over its current trajectory. But this balancing act will only become more difficult as Brazil seeks further multipolarity and asserts itself as a leader in the Global South. While Brazil’s geopolitically quiet neighbourhood has often been advantageous, it may also result in relative blindness to the outcomes and stakes of the tug-of-war between multipolarity and bipolarity. Three reflections remain on this outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, US-Brazil relations offer a case study on how partnerships with the US can inform broader alignment strategies, especially in the context of national foreign policy traditions breaking down along partisan lines. Brazil has been at the forefront of a recent trend of alignment based on ruling parties rather than a broader sense of national interest. As a result, US-Brazil relations now clearly fluctuate depending on who holds power in both countries. For example, if the Brazilian Right returns to power, further alignment with Trump’s United States can be expected. Such alignment would also enjoy support from a significant portion of Brazil’s increasingly ideological public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further complication lies in Brazil’s judiciary, which has constrained both the power of the country’s own executive and the influence of US tech companies. This has resulted in a major rallying cry in Washington and Silicon Valley. The European Union and its member states would do well to examine the Brazilian case to avoid some of the same pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China’s growing influence is a reality that Brazil must navigate, especially in the realm of trade and investments. Brazil’s total exports to China are already more than double those to the United States, and within a few years, the US share may shrink to just one-third. While this means that the US trading relationship is diminishing in importance, there is a good chance that Brazil will still benefit from such a shift, as global trade tensions create new openings: US tariff policy has made China buy more soy, Japan more beef, and perhaps even France will drop its opposition to the EU-Mercosur deal. Despite never having been known for the lowest tariffs, Brazil has long supported rules-based trade, and the country is generally well-placed in Trump’s view of the trading world – with the US holding a slight surplus in bilateral trade. Still, this will be a difficult adjustment for Brazil’s foreign policy outlook. This raises a third and vital point below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s geopolitical climate, Brazil may simply end up aligning against the United States, perhaps even accidentally. This could happen, for example, if Brazil continues to pursue multipolarity in a world that – contrary to most current projections – shifts towards bipolarity. Under such circumstances, the very pursuit of multipolarity could draw Brazil closer to China, the beneficiary of today’s anti-hegemonic policies. While Brazil may try to avoid unnecessary confrontation with the United States today, this is no easy task for a government that also seeks to express disagreement for the sake of what it perceives as a greater good. As Lula said during a March 2025 visit to Japan, “Trump is not the world’s sheriff – he’s only president of the United States,” adding that protectionism must be overcome if free trade is to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is clear who the main target of such a statement is, it can also be interpreted as a message to Brussels. Brazil has waited more than a quarter of a century for a trade deal with the European Union; and for just as long, it has decried Europe’s fluctuating interest in both the country and the deal. Without ratification of the EU-Mercosur agreement, Brazil’s distance from not only the United States but also from other parts of the Global West will only grow. Europe would do well to heed such calls for cooperation and build common cause with Brazil and other countries of the non-aligned – or at least less-aligned – Global South whenever possible. The recent trade agreement with Chile is a good start. But without more substantial change, Brazil may ultimately shift from a tradition of constructive diplomacy to openly challenging Western-led institutions. In such a world, the reform of global governance would not be achieved through compromise but, at best, through the ascension of the Global South or, more troublingly, the rise of the Global East. For these reasons, Europeans should also endeavour to develop a vision of global order that is ameliorative and does not run counter to their own interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, any European vision should be one that Brazil could share and one that helps tether the country to global institutions. Such an outlook would prepare the international system for a world in which Brazil may no longer be able to pursue multipolarity and maintain alignment with the United States at the same time. In a period of intensifying bipolar rivalry, Washington is likely to resume demanding clear alignment from its friends and allies – even if, at present, it is sending mixed signals about its own alliances and other commitments. As such, Brasília – and the viability of its double-edged foreign policy – is something that all global observers should watch. Luckily, Brazil has recently made this easier by assuming the presidency of several international forums. Being under the spotlight also makes it harder to practise any form of strategic ambiguity; instead, the country’s contradictions and challenges are now in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since launching its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Russia has relentlessly attacked Ukraine’s energy system, along with other infrastructure. In November 2024 alone, Russia fired 350 missiles and over 2,500 drones at the Ukrainian power grid. As a result of these attacks, the total damage to the energy infrastructure—heating, power, and oil and gas—at the end of 2024 was estimated at $20.5 billion, while the cost to rebuild according to EU standards amounts to $67.8 billion. Combining the occupied, destroyed, and damaged power capacities, Ukraine has lost a total of approximately 27 gigawatts (GW) of its pre-war installed capacity of 56.1 GW. Ukrainian citizens and businesses entered recent winters with less than half of their power generation available, forcing authorities to introduce restrictions on the supply of electricity. Emergency measures—such as repairing damaged generation capacity and deploying thousands of backup diesel generators—have provided stopgaps to the current dire situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid this crisis, energy decentralization as a strategy for survival has moved to the forefront of expert discussions. Small, distributed power units, ranging from 5 to 100 megawatts (MW) each, are regarded as the only way to prevent a nationwide blackout and ensure a stable electricity supply to people and businesses. In addition, these small units are not an easy target for Russian missiles. Importantly, decentralization also aligns with Ukraine’s long-term commitment to a more sustainable and balanced energy mix. According to Ukrainian and international experts, rebuilding Ukraine’s grid on the old, centralized model with outdated coal plants and dependence on imported fuel is not an option. Instead, Ukraine has a unique opportunity to build a modern energy system relying on a more balanced and efficient mix, strengthening its future energy security and economic resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next two years are critical for Ukraine’s energy security. As Russian attacks persist, Ukraine is racing to winterize its grid and add new generation capacity. At the same time, there is significant work ahead for the Ukrainian government—both at the national and subnational levels—in terms of regulations, reforms, and incentives to address Ukraine’s energy challenges. The international donor community and foreign investors are watching developments in the country very closely, as they will be key players in achieving Ukraine’s vision. For the United States, supporting Ukraine’s energy modernization aligns with its strategic interests in the country and the broader region: It creates markets for U.S. firms, strengthens Ukraine’s resiliency, and diminishes Russia’s ability to cripple the Ukrainian economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building off prior work conducted by CSIS, this paper discusses how to rebuild Ukraine’s energy system to ensure access, strengthen security, and promote sustainability. The paper provides a description of the country’s future energy mix, the policy and regulatory reforms needed, and the role that international partners—including the United States—can play in its modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ukraines-future-energy-mix-outlook-and-challenges&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s Future Energy Mix: Outlook and Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine inherited a Soviet energy model, characterized by a centralized, state-owned monopoly with huge generation facilities serving the entire country. Ukraine’s power system was dominated by large nuclear, coal, and hydroelectric plants feeding a Soviet-era grid, run by state-owned companies (e.g., Energoatom for nuclear power and Ukrenergo for the grid) and a few private conglomerates, such as the Donbass Fuel-Energy Company (DTEK). Ukrenergo operates the national grid centrally, which was synchronized with the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) grid post-2022. Local generation was minimal, aside from some industrial cogeneration, and municipalities had little role in electricity beyond distribution utilities. As a result, fossil fuels and nuclear energy dominate the energy mix (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centralized nature of Ukraine’s energy system has advantages such as economies of scale, better coordination, and reliance on proven technologies. However, it is vulnerable to large-scale disruptions, including grid failures or attacks, which can lead to widespread blackouts. The system also suffers from high transmission losses, as electricity must travel long distances from power plants to users. In addition, the system is inflexible and slow to adapt to changes in demand or new technologies. Building and maintaining them also requires significant investment and high capital costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dgV8v3S.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Ukraine’s Energy Supply, 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While nuclear power currently provides approximately 50 percent of electricity generation and remains a cornerstone of Ukraine’s energy system, policymakers are increasingly emphasizing the need to diversify energy sources and decentralize power generation. The aim is to reduce dependence on a few large facilities, including high-risk nuclear sites, and shift toward a more distributed, resilient mix of renewables, storage, and flexible backup sources. Experts argue that the only way to modernize the system and ensure Ukraine’s long-term survival is to build numerous local power facilities (ranging from 5 to 100 MW) instead of relying on a few large power plants. Post-invasion, there is an opportunity to allow more independent power producers and community-level generation. According to recent studies from the Energy Community and the International Energy Agency, the target energy mix for Ukraine includes adding gas and biomass units, batteries, wind, and solar photovoltaics (PV) over 10 years. If realized, this vision would significantly increase electricity capacity from varied sources by 2035, enhancing the system’s efficiency and sustainability. A more diversified energy portfolio, including fossil fuels, renewables, and nuclear power, will be essential to building a more sustainable future for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, nevertheless, nuclear, large-scale hydroelectric, and gas-fired power will remain essential pillars of Ukraine’s base load capacity. While small-scale, distributed generation is crucial for the system’s resilience, it is equally important to recognize the role of centralized energy sources for Ukraine’s energy security. Plans are underway to construct new reactors, including small modular reactors (SMRs), to replace aging infrastructure and enhance resilience. Additionally, natural gas-fired power plants provide flexibility to balance the grid, especially during peak demand periods. Biomass and gas-fired generation would be a good addition to renewables, helping to cover evening and wintertime peaks of consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy-reforms-and-financing&quot;&gt;Energy Reforms and Financing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support a more modern energy system, the Ukrainian government has enacted regulatory reforms, including tax and customs exemptions for importing energy equipment. In June 2024, Ukraine’s cabinet of ministers approved a National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) for 2025–2030, with investment needs estimated between $41.5 billion and $50 billion. The plan aims to reach 27 percent renewable energy in the final energy consumption by 2030, up from the current 10 percent. The NECP includes adding approximately 10 GW of new renewable capacity and cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 65 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Shortly after, the government of Ukraine announced a $20 billion plan to achieve these targets—aiming to increase the share of renewables in electricity generation from the current 10 percent to 27 percent by 2030—reflecting both wartime necessity and EU Green Deal alignment. Moreover, in August 2024 the cabinet of ministers approved a Strategy for the Development of Distributed Generation until 2035, aiming to enhance grid resilience through decentralized energy solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, to enable local authorities to contribute to the modernization of the energy system, in January 2025 the Ukrainian parliament adopted Law No. 9381, which simplifies regulatory procedures and stimulates investments to build a decentralized and sustainable energy sector. The law’s provisions aim to (i) promote the development of a distributed energy system so that it is more resilient during wartime; (ii) simplify the connection of new power generation capacities, including renewable energy sources; and (iii) increase the transparency and predictability of energy projects. This law also aligns with the European Union’s Ukraine Facility requirement that 20 percent of the funding is directed to the recovery, reconstruction, and modernization of subnational needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To develop the renewable power sector, Ukraine will require $20 billion in new investments by 2030. Approximately half of that capacity will replace generation destroyed by Russia’s attacks, and the other half will support growth and energy diversification. Notably, these figures assume significant private sector participation. With domestic public finances strained by wartime budget deficits, Ukraine will have to rely on international financial institutions (IFIs) and private investors to supply most of the financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some financing is underway even under wartime conditions (see Box 1). These cases illustrate how donor-backed risk mitigation tools and local financial institutions can jointly scale clean technologies. However, international partners expect Ukraine to implement clear reforms as conditions for renewed investment, such as removing local content requirements that often deter foreign companies from entering the market. Moreover, to attract sufficient financing, investors expect a stable regulatory framework, and unfortunately, Ukraine’s energy policy remains unpredictable. In the late 2010s, a very generous feed-in tariff (FiT) spurred a renewables boom, only to be followed by retroactive FiT cuts and unpaid debts to renewable producers in 2020–2021. This eroded investor confidence. An attempted transition to an auction-based incentive system was delayed for years. When pilot renewable auctions finally took place in late 2024 and 2025, they failed to attract interest. There were no bidders for solar or wind projects, and only one small hydro project secured a contract. The reasons are clear: policy instability, payment arrears, and flawed auction design. Investors have seen the “rules of the game” change repeatedly in Ukraine: FiT rates were cut by the parliament, contracts were not honored in full, and a 2020 mediation memorandum of understanding with renewable associations was not fully implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In early 2025, OKKO Group (a Ukrainian holding company that owns a large network of gas stations in Ukraine) secured €157 million ($176 million) in international finance through the European Union’s Ukraine Investment Framework (UIF) to develop clean energy projects, demonstrating how blended finance mechanisms under the Ukraine Facility can unlock large-scale private sector involvement.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Similarly, the Ukrainian energy company KNESS secured a €9.6 million ($10.35 million) loan from Oschadbank (also known as the State Savings Bank of Ukraine)—supported by a European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) guarantee—to build large battery systems that help stabilize the electricity grid.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Eco-Optima is constructing the Sokal Wind Farm in Lviv Oblast, with €40 million ($43.2 million) in financing from Oschadbank, including a €24.8 million ($28.3 million) green letter of credit facilitated by the EBRD.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Additionally, Energy Trade Group (a Ukrainian private company comprising a conglomerate of businesses specializing in the trading of gas and electricity) is building a 93 MW wind farm in Kirovohrad Oblast, financed with €26 million ($30.6 million) from the large state bank Ukrgasbank, the EBRD, and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), utilizing financial instruments such as an EBRD credit risk guarantee.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DTEK Renewables (a Ukrainian company managing the renewable energy assets of DTEK Group) received a €67 million ($76.5 million) loan from a consortium of Ukrainian banks—led by Oschadbank, together with PUMB (First Ukrainian International Bank, a leading bank in Ukraine owned by SCM Holdings) and Ukrgasbank (a leading Ukrainian state owned bank)—to construct five battery energy storage systems (BESS) across Ukraine by 2030. This is the largest domestic infrastructure loan for a BESS project in Ukraine. The project will deliver 180 MW of energy storage capacity in 2025, with a total 200 MW planned—enough to serve 600,000 households.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine needs to pursue a series of comprehensive market reforms and provide insurance mechanisms and guarantees that can reassure investors of the stability and predictability of the renewable energy sector. At the moment, Ukraine is overhauling its renewable energy auction program. In April 2025, the parliament introduced Draft Law No. 13219, proposing a shift from two-way contracts for difference (CfD) to one-way feed-in premiums (FiP), extended auction timelines, and more flexible participation rules. Concurrently, the government approved annual auction quotas for 2025–2029, starting with 330 MW in 2025—including 150 MW for wind—and scaling up to 400 MW by 2029. However, current auction quotas remain modest relative to national targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/v25KMpq.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: How Auction Quotas Reflect Needed Generation Capacity vs. Transmission System Operator (TSO) Estimates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As illustrated in Table 1, government-approved auction volumes for 2025–2029 will cover only a fraction of Ukraine’s total renewable capacity needs by 2030: 5 percent for solar, 30 percent for wind, and 20 percent for biomass/biogas. This gap will require complementary mechanisms: direct private investments, donor-supported tenders, and long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with major producers. For instance, Kazakhstan has signed a 25-year PPA with TotalEnergies for the 1 GW Mirny wind project, which includes a 600 megawatt-hour (MWh) battery energy storage system and is expected to supply electricity to 1 million people. Similarly, Uzbekistan has entered into a 25-year PPA with Voltalia for the 526 MW Artemisya hybrid project, combining solar, wind, and battery storage to meet the electricity needs of approximately 2.5 million inhabitants. These models could offer valuable insights for Ukraine’s renewable energy strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond cumbersome regulations, another challenging area affecting energy projects is currency stability and convertibility. Currently, Ukraine has currency controls due to martial law. Investors worry about being unable to repatriate profits in hard currency. Ukraine will need to gradually lift these controls and possibly hedge currency risk. The National Bank of Ukraine, with International Monetary Fund support, could set up a currency swap facility or guarantee that investors can convert a specific amount of hryvnia to dollars or euros at a predictable rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, Ukraine has introduced tax incentives to bolster renewable energy investments. As of July 27, 2024, the government enacted laws exempting certain energy-generating equipment from import duties and value-added tax (VAT), including PV panels, lithium-ion batteries, inverters, and specific components for wind turbines. However, complete wind turbine units remain subject to VAT and import duties, which may affect the competitiveness of wind energy projects. These exemptions are valid during the period of martial law but are set to expire on January 1, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final challenge in rebuilding and maintaining the energy system is the availability of a skilled workforce. The war has displaced millions of Ukrainians, including engineers and electricians. For instance, a Ukrainian-American microgrid provider noted that many of the “best electricians left the front lines for safer places,” leading to maintenance issues with backup generators in hospitals. Rebuilding the energy sector will require mobilizing and training a new generation of workers—from construction crews to power system operators. Ukraine’s education and training institutions need to ramp up programs in renewable energy technology, engineering, and project management. Workforce readiness also means ensuring safety and security for personnel working in conflict zones—another reason why many projects focus on relatively safer western and central regions for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these hurdles, workforce capacity is growing. Ukrainian companies and municipalities have gained experience operating microgrids and modular systems during the war, and many professionals are contributing their expertise remotely. With strategic support, Ukraine can cultivate the human capital needed to operate a modern decentralized grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-subnational-governments&quot;&gt;The Role of Subnational Governments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, Ukrainian cities had little autonomy in energy matters: The system was top-down. But the war has thrust local governments and mayors into a critical role in keeping the lights on and serving as frontline leaders during the energy crisis. Due to the war, they have had to improvise solutions to maintain heating and lighting for local businesses and residents. The wartime experience has demonstrated the huge value of government decentralization, with empowered local authorities responding and targeting resources for communities in need. Mayors have spearheaded installing local generation and backup systems. Local governments are now drafting “resilience plans” that include building renewable energy at municipal facilities, procuring portable generators, and even exploring municipal utilities. The decentralization of political power in Ukraine in recent years has allowed local councils to enter partnerships and pilot projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving a more decentralized and sustainable energy future will undoubtedly require the involvement of subnational governments: regions (oblasts), districts (rayons), and municipalities (hromadas). If the concept of energy cooperatives is fully legalized, it will empower villages or city districts to develop shared energy resources. Ukraine is looking to models from the European Union (like German energy cooperatives) for guidance. The U.S. experience with co-ops and municipal utilities could also be instructive, illustrating how local entities can run parts of the energy system effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mayors often serve as vital connectors between national initiatives and local demands. These governments can identify suitable land or rooftops for solar projects, streamline permitting processes, and cofinance initiatives through city budgets. For example, the city of Vinnytsia in central Ukraine has championed the integration of renewable energy into the city’s district heating system and is actively advancing plans for a municipal waste-to-energy facility. Another example is Mykolaiv—a southern city near the front line—which installed 5.5 MW of its own generation capacity (a mix of diesel gensets, solar PV, and battery storage) to power critical facilities like water pumping stations. The city’s water utility now has solar panels to ensure potable water supply even if the main grid fails. Such projects illustrate how mayors are leveraging decentralized energy sources to provide essential services to their citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, most Ukrainian municipalities cannot fully fund large energy investments on their own and must attract outside capital. Communities are “open for business” and eager to pilot innovative energy solutions, with donor support. Demand is high at the local level for decentralized solutions—from villages to large cities, there is an appetite to generate their own power if financing can be found. Many Ukrainian cities have concrete clean energy projects with future revenue streams (e.g., selling power to the grid or cutting energy bills for city services) (see Box 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, mayors are also promoting transparency and good governance to bolster investor confidence and attract private finance. For example, the city of Mykolaiv, in partnership with the European Union’s Anti-Corruption Initiative, launched a public website to track international aid funds and updated procurement regulations to root out corruption. By improving accountability, cities aim to be “investment-ready” for donor-funded projects and public-private partnerships. As Mayor Oleksandr Syenkevych puts it, “Mykolaiv is ready to be a reliable partner” for energy reconstruction programs. However, there is a need for a national platform to connect cities, investors, and banks—essentially a matchmaking mechanism so that willing cities and private financiers can find each other. This could be as simple as a central project listing database or a more sophisticated endeavor such as an investment facilitation office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic role of mayors goes beyond individual projects: They are important partners in managing and sustaining decentralized energy systems in the long term. A microgrid in a town will likely be operated by the local private utility or the municipality, so local capacity and ownership is critical. By involving mayors in planning and financing discussions now, donors and investors ensure there will be buy-in in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-2-examples-of-decentralized-energy-projects-in-ukrainian-cities&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 2: Examples of Decentralized Energy Projects in Ukrainian Cities&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mykolaiv Solar Water Utilities Project: 5 MW solar PV and 1 MWh battery to power the city’s Vodokanal (water pumping and treatment facilities). Status: 1 MW already installed with local funds; in May 2025, the Nordic Environment Finance Corporation (NEFCO) approved a €7.2 million ($7.8 million) grant to scale up the project across multiple water infrastructure sites in Mykolaiv. Value: Ensures continuous access to potable water during blackouts by reducing reliance on grid electricity and diesel. The solar-battery combination strengthens climate and war-related resilience for essential services. Long-term cost savings are expected through lower electricity bills and reduced operational risks.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Vinnytsia Waste-to-Energy Plant: Proposed 10 MW facility aims to convert municipal solid waste into electricity and heat, generating an estimated 80 GWh annually. Status: A feasibility study has already been completed, and the city is currently seeking approximately $30 million in public-private partnership investment. Value: The project would significantly reduce reliance on landfills while delivering around-the-clock energy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Khmelnytskyi region currently hosts multiple operational solar farms, adding up to roughly to 14.9 MW of capacity on city‑owned land. Value: The region is clearly scaling both solar and storage capabilities, and co-locating batteries with PV installations is part of their strategic resilience approach.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;financing-options&quot;&gt;Financing Options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond regulatory reforms, the involvement of subnational governments, and investment in workforce capacity, Ukraine will require substantial financial resources to realize its energy vision. This financing gap could be narrowed through a combination of guarantees (such as price floors or insurance), development finance, and innovative partnerships with Western companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, Europe and the United States have been strong partners to Ukraine by providing financial and technical assistance for the restoration of its energy infrastructure from Russian attacks. Europe is further stepping up with the Ukraine Facility, a $56 billion program for 2024–2027 to support recovery. Crucially, at least 20 percent of EU grant funding must go directly to subnational projects—rebuilding regional and local infrastructure, including energy systems. This reflects a recognition that empowering cities and communities is vital for effective reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the World Bank Group and the EBRD are heavily involved in Ukraine’s energy sector recovery. They are considering mechanisms like a “Premium Support Fund” to ensure renewable auction winners get paid, as well as the Electricity Price Guaranteed Fund (EPGF), which is currently under elaboration by the EBRD. The concept of the EPGF is essentially a donor-funded mechanism to guarantee minimum revenue for the power plant. If market electricity prices fall below an agreed minimum (the auction strike price), the fund pays the difference to renewable producers, ensuring revenue stability. If prices are higher, producers keep the majority of the upside, while paying special premium or commission to the fund (i.e., no “reverse payments” back to the state, unlike the current CfD scheme). This EPGF would be initially capitalized by grants from the European Union, IFIs, and others. One entity, perhaps the EBRD, would manage it, providing transparent administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of future U.S. funding to support the energy sector, the Trump administration is in the process of evaluating its foreign assistance priorities and hence aid is currently on hold. This includes winding down the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Energy Security Project and other technical assistance programs in Ukraine. While U.S. foreign aid retrenchment is part of a broader government efficiency agenda, the administration continues to emphasize “energy security” in geopolitical terms—chiefly, reducing dependence on hostile powers and promoting stable energy markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting Ukraine’s energy recovery not only undermines Russia’s leverage but also opens avenues for U.S. investment in Ukraine’s critical mineral resources, as evidenced by the recent U.S.-Ukraine Mineral Resources Agreement, signed in May 2025. This agreement provides the United States with preferential access to Ukraine’s valuable natural resources, tying future aid to shared profits from its vast reserves of rare earth minerals, oil, gas, and other hydrocarbons. Such strategic economic partnerships reinforce U.S. interests in the region and contribute to global energy stability. In addition, developing Ukraine’s mining resources will require complementary investments in transport infrastructure and energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means U.S. support for Ukraine will favor facilitating private investment and trade (e.g., exporting U.S. liquefied natural gas technology and modular reactors) over direct aid. The U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC), which has a mandate to mobilize private capital in challenging environments, could become a key player in Ukraine in the near future. The DFC can provide political risk insurance, project financing, and loan guarantees to U.S. investors and Ukrainian ventures, effectively filling some of the void left by the U.S. Agency for International Development’s closure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among a range of financial tools, the DFC has the ability to provide up to $1 billion in insurance and financing support per project. For instance, the DFC could back a political risk insurance facility specifically for Ukraine’s energy sector—covering risks such as war damage, expropriation, or breach of contract. It can also deploy equity stakes in funds or projects, essentially giving a U.S. government seal of approval that can crowd in other investors. It can also guarantee loans made by banks to Ukrainian energy projects, lowering interest rates. One idea is setting up a “Ukraine Clean Energy Fund,” where the DFC and European partners seed a fund that coinvests in dozens of decentralized energy projects alongside private investors. This diversifies risk and provides a one-stop vehicle for investors interested in rebuilding the energy sector under a facility with professional management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, joint U.S.-Ukrainian private sector initiatives can be part of the financing. An urban investment platform can be set up where U.S. and Ukrainian firms form consortia to bid on projects in municipal energy projects. The feasibility of joint investments is high in areas like wind, where Ukrainian developers have experience and U.S. firms have capital and technology. However, it is contingent on risk mitigation: Without guarantees on political risk and a clear signal from the U.S. government (such as a special envoy or task force to promote U.S. investment), many U.S. private investors will remain hesitant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opportunities-for-us-ukraine-collaboration&quot;&gt;Opportunities for U.S.-Ukraine Collaboration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukraine rebuilds and transforms its energy system, it can incorporate lessons from the decentralized and flexible approach seen in the United States and the European Union. In the case of the United States, its energy system has evolved since the 1880s, resulting in a diverse and decentralized electricity model in many parts of the country. While the United States also has large power plants, it features robust independent power producers and distributed energy resources like rooftop solar, battery storage, and gas microturbines. Hundreds of microgrids—over 700 as of 2024—operate across the United States, especially for campuses, military bases, and critical facilities, providing resilience during outages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key elements of the U.S. model that could inform Ukraine’s future energy system include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role of Municipal Utilities and Co-ops:&lt;/strong&gt; In the United States, many towns and cities own their electric utilities or are served by rural electric cooperatives, which gives localities influence over generation choices. U.S. municipal utilities (like in Austin, Texas; Sacramento, California; and other cities) have successfully built solar farms, battery projects, and even owned shares in wind farms to serve their cities. Knowledge sharing or twinning programs could help Ukrainian mayors and utility managers adopt best practices in governance and energy planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microgrid Technology:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. companies are global leaders in microgrid controls, battery energy management, and gas engine generators. Collaboration could involve technology transfer—for example, U.S. firms supplying control systems that allow Ukrainian local grids to island, or disconnect, during an attack and then reconnect. The recent example of U.S.-Ukrainian firm New Use Energy delivering solar and battery units to Mykolaiv’s trauma hospital is a case in point. Scaling this up, U.S. providers could partner with Ukrainian firms to deploy hundreds of such microgrids at clinics, water systems, and telecommunications towers across Ukraine. This would directly support the goal of a decentralized grid as called for by the Group of Seven Clean Energy Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Sector Culture:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. energy projects typically rely on private capital with various risk mitigation instruments. Ukraine can emulate models like public-private partnerships for energy infrastructure. For example, a city could concession a solar plant project to a U.S. investor under a long-term agreement where the city agrees to purchase power (a municipal PPA). Such models are standard in the United States (e.g., cities buying solar power from private solar farms to meet renewable goals). To facilitate this in Ukraine, standardized contracts and credit enhancements will be needed (e.g., if a city’s credit is weak, a donor agency could guarantee the payments).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology Transfer:&lt;/strong&gt; From smart grid equipment to small modular reactors (SMRs), U.S. companies have technology that Ukraine is interested in. Notably, Ukraine’s NECP mentions exploring hydrogen, energy storage, and SMRs by 2030. U.S. firms like NuScale or Westinghouse (already working with Energoatom on nuclear fuel) could pilot SMR deployment in Ukraine’s context, perhaps at a retired coal plant site. On a smaller scale, U.S. solar and battery manufacturers can find a market as Ukraine rebuilds—this aligns with U.S. industrial policy to support domestic clean technology manufacturing. Facilitating export-import of this equipment, possibly via U.S. Export-Import (EXIM) Bank financing or the DFC, would accelerate Ukraine’s energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy and Market Design Support:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. regulators (such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state utility commissions) and grid operators (such as PJM—Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, the largest grid operator in the United States—and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc [ERCOT]) have extensive experience integrating renewables and ensuring grid reliability. Ukrainian energy regulators and the Ministry of Energy can benefit from technical advisory exchanges. For example, learning how U.S. markets handle capacity payments, ancillary services, and demand response could help Ukraine update its electricity market to reward flexibility—a key for balancing renewables. Although Ukraine is already a member of the Energy Community (an organization bringing together the European Union and nine neighboring EU candidate or potential candidate countries to create an integrated regional energy market based on a legally binding framework) and synchronizes with ENTSO-E (the European grid), insights from the United States on how to develop a competitive market (and cautionary lessons from California’s early blackouts or Texas’s 2021 freeze) could also be valuable as Ukraine reimagines its energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joint Ventures and Investment:&lt;/strong&gt; Perhaps the most impactful collaboration is through joint investment projects, with U.S. investors partnering on municipal energy projects. One example is Vinnytsia’s solar farm proposal: The city has land available and demand for a 50 MW solar farm with battery storage to stabilize its grid. A U.S. investor could team up with a Ukrainian developer under the DFC’s political risk insurance to build it, with power sold under Ukraine’s upcoming auction or a contract with the city. Similarly, waste-to-energy plants in cities like Khmelnytskyi (which has a major nuclear plant and is exploring using nuclear heat for district heating) could use U.S. waste-to-energy tech. These projects could be structured as profit-sharing enterprises where both the U.S. and Ukrainian private sectors invest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, U.S. stakeholders should approach Ukraine’s energy modernization not from the traditional foreign aid lens, but as strategic commercial opportunities. For U.S. energy companies, this is a timely opportunity to enter a new and expanding market, build lasting partnerships, and support democratic allies through economic engagement. Partnering with Ukrainian municipalities offers a chance to deploy innovative technologies in real-world conditions, while contributing to the resilience and recovery of critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in Ukraine today lays the foundation for long-term business growth and aligns directly with U.S. interests in energy security and global competitiveness. This dual benefit—advancing national interests while opening new commercial avenues—should appeal to both Washington policymakers and the U.S. private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-ahead-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead: Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s energy future hinges on providing a stable regulatory environment, resolving pending issues and off-taker agreements (i.e., arrangements between producers of renewable energy and their buyers), empowering subnational governments and cities through direct funding and technical aid, and leveraging private sector joint ventures for technology transfer and investment. This final section provides specific policy recommendations to operationalize these solutions, ensuring that Ukraine’s energy transformation moves from planning to implementation, even amid uncertainty. The following are key recommendations for U.S. government agencies, Ukrainian authorities, and international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Ukraine’s Energy Market Reforms:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine needs to implement energy market reforms, and EU partners—together with the U.S. Department of Energy—can support this process by providing technical assistance, including the following actions:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assist Ukraine’s energy regulator, the National Energy and Utilities Regulatory Commission (NEURC), in developing reliable tariff methodologies that ensure cost-recovery for renewables and eliminate payment backlogs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encourage Ukraine to implement proportional curtailment compensation and priority dispatch for renewables to boost investor trust that their assets will not be arbitrarily shut off without compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assist in critical reforms under Chapter 15 (Energy) and Chapter 21 (Trans-European Networks) of the EU Acquis (the EU body of laws), including steps to liberalize energy markets, strengthen independent regulation, modernize and integrate energy networks with Europe, and accelerate the energy transition. Ukraine still needs to implement several energy reforms to align fully with EU standards, related to the following issues:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The electricity and gas markets remain only partially liberalized. Wartime interventions, price caps, and a remonopolization of the gas sector under martial law continue to distort competition and hinder a truly open market.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;NEURC’s autonomy remains limited. Although legal reforms have been enacted, the commission still operates under executive control, and with at least one plotted vacancy and a lack of transparent replacement procedures, it has yet to achieve the independent, EU-compliant regulatory structure required for Chapter 15 alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the renewables sector, Ukraine has introduced market-based support schemes (auctions and feed-in premiums), but these are not yet fully operational. Their proper implementation is crucial to attract investment and settle outstanding debts to renewable energy producers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In parallel, Ukraine must modernize its electricity grid and expand cross-border interconnections, as wartime damage and inadequate network tariffs have impeded the investments needed for a reliable energy infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finally, building up strategic energy reserves remains a priority. While Ukraine adopted an oil stockpiling law in line with EU requirements, implementation is incomplete and minimum reserves are not yet maintained. Similarly, Ukraine must finalize its gas security of supply framework, including legal transposition, emergency planning, and strategic storage targets, to fully comply with EU rules.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand Engagement in Municipal Energy Projects:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the importance of subnational governments in Ukraine’s energy modernization, donors could engage more directly with city-level projects. For example, they could:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encourage the EU Ukraine Facility and World Bank to allocate grants or subsidized-interest loans for municipal energy programs, through existing frameworks like the Ukraine Municipal Infrastructure Program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Embed technical advisors, such as retired utility executives or engineers, with key cities to help mayors plan and execute energy projects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fund a Project Preparation Facility specifically for energy that helps Ukrainian communities conduct pre-feasibility studies, permitting, and tendering for clean energy projects—creating a pipeline of “bankable” projects ready for auction or direct investment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complete a small auction or reverse auction for municipal projects to build confidence for larger ones. For example, solicit bids for 100 MW of biomass and solar and battery storage projects across several city sites, with cofunding from an international donor. Ensure that the contracts are awarded quickly to start construction without major delays.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facilitate Partnerships with Businesses:&lt;/strong&gt; Business associations operating in Ukraine—such as the American Chamber of Commerce Ukraine, the European Business Association, and the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council—could act as conveners and facilitate alliances between U.S., European, and Ukrainian businesses and subnational governments. The activities they could pursue include:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Organizing trade missions and virtual pitch sessions where Ukrainian municipalities can present projects to U.S. and European companies and investors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launching a “U.S.-Ukraine Energy Partnership Exchange” by bringing Ukrainian mayors and energy officials to visit U.S. microgrid sites, while sending U.S. city energy managers to Ukraine, if security permits. These exchanges would build relationships that support technology transfer and twinning arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Up an Electricity Price Guarantee Fund:&lt;/strong&gt; Work with allies to create an Electricity Minimum Price Guarantee Fund for Ukraine’s renewable projects. Such a fund could address off-taker risk and unlock several billion dollars in private investment. The European Union or United States could contribute seed funding (e.g., via a DFC-administered fund) to help reach an initial $300 to $500 million target. Managed by a multilateral entity, this fund would guarantee a floor price for power from renewables, ensuring revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand U.S. Financing Options:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should authorize and encourage institutions such as the DFC and the EXIM Bank to deploy their full suite of tools in Ukraine. Specifically, it should:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expand DFC’s insurance products covering energy projects. The DFC could also invest in private equity funds that cofinance dozens of renewable and battery installations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include Ukrainian clean energy projects in the remit of the EXIM Bank for export credit support. For example, the EXIM Bank could finance U.S. equipment sales for a solar farm in Ukraine with sovereign or city guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extend the U.S.-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund to cover energy infrastructure including grid upgrades, renewables, and storage, which involves minerals such as lithium, cobalt, copper, and rare earths used in batteries, turbines, and power networks. This would accelerate Ukraine’s EU‑compliant energy transition and support the resilience of U.S. critical raw materials supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address Workforce Gaps Through Training:&lt;/strong&gt; Workforce development should be built into every investment by promoting on-site training for Ukrainian technicians and prioritizing the use of local labor. Donors and investors could make skilled worker training a condition of funding—for example, pairing a solar plant project with the training of local electricians. Training not only helps ensure projects are properly staffed and run smoothly, but also strengthens Ukraine’s pool of skilled workers. The United States could support this effort by helping expand Ukrainian vocational programs in fields like solar installation and electrical engineering, potentially through online courses offered by U.S. community colleges or companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Up a Monitoring System:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, donors and partners, in collaboration with Ukraine, could establish a strong monitoring system to track progress on reforms and the implementation of energy projects. This system would help identify setbacks early and enable timely adjustments. For instance, if a strategy is not working, such as auctions failing due to war-related risks, stakeholders should be ready to pivot, possibly by adopting negotiated PPAs or increasing donor guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has a unique opportunity to transform its energy system into a decentralized, secure, and sustainable model. Such a transition would not only strengthen the resilience of its infrastructure against future Russian threats but also accelerate its integration into the Western energy market, advancing both Ukraine’s energy independence and U.S. strategic and economic interests in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of evolving geopolitical pressures and rising energy demands, this report from the Energy Security and Climate Change Program explores why integrating the electric grids of Europe and the Mediterranean is essential to European energy security and climate change goals. It examines the drivers of interconnection, such as decarbonization, economic resilience, and digital transformation, and the technical, regulatory, and political challenges to such integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on insights from a high-level convening in Athens, Greece, cohosted by CSIS and the German Marshall Fund of the United States, the report examines the Mediterranean region’s role in linking European energy markets to renewable-rich regions in North Africa. Several planned cross-border projects are positioned to not only supply clean energy to Europe, but also to strengthen political cooperation, attract foreign investment, and spur economic development in partner regions. As this report details, grid integration has emerged as a cornerstone of Europe’s long-term energy strategy, helping to respond to climate change, address energy prices, and mitigate strategic vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;geopolitics-connectivity-and-energy-security-an-athens-conversation&quot;&gt;Geopolitics, Connectivity, and Energy Security: An Athens Conversation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 31, 2025, the German Marshall Fund of the United States, in collaboration with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, hosted a conference in Athens, Greece. Sponsored by the Public Power Corporation S.A. (PPC), this meeting was the third in a series of convenings that had begun a year prior in Washington, D.C. But this one came at a precipitous time, as President Donald Trump and his administration were rapidly realigning the foreign policy of the United States and its stance toward Europe. The urgency and uncertainty of the moment forced participants beyond convention and toward a survey of the new ground on which the politics of energy will play out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Leverag[ing] technological progress and steep cost curves to produce homegrown renewable electricity … coupled with expansion and modernization of our power grids contributes to the affordability and energy security of the region.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OLD ALLIES, NEW RULES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s approach to transatlantic issues has awed European leaders. In February, Vice President JD Vance gave a speech at the Munich Security Conference that offered a stinging critique of European political leaders and their approach to domestic and international politics. The Trump administration seemed dedicated to withdrawing security support for Europe to force the bloc to stand up for its own defense. The administration’s haste to reform the transatlantic relationship, alongside its aim to force peace between Russia and Ukraine, felt to many in Europe like abandonment. Trade conflicts added an economic dimension to the perceived antagonism. Liberation Day, which came just two days after this conference, threatened a 20 percent tariff on European goods entering the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panelists in Athens agreed on the urgent need for Europe to establish a strategy for engagement with the United States and chart its own path forward in global affairs. With a rapidly receding United States, they pointed out, European leaders will need to find ways to manage internal strife and political dynamics to focus on essential goals: funding defense, ensuring economic competitiveness, and dealing with the new economic nationalism of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, panelists on either side of this reorientation were optimistic about the prospects for Europe and the transatlantic relationship that will emerge under these new conditions. Panelists observed that pressure from the United States could incentivize Europe into deeper internal collaboration around key areas: security, economic competitiveness, and energy. They also noted that the more independent Europe which emerges could be a larger economic and geopolitical force than the Europe of today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I think two enduring feature of Trumpism that are not just going to be a feature of this administration, but likely continue going forward is greater transactionalism and more nationalism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I actually think Europe’s going to emerge from this stronger definitely on the security front. And I actually think the pressure from Trump is going to drive a lot of economic reforms in Europe that’s going to make Europe more competitive. So, I’m actually bullish on Europe. I would buy Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Transatlantic relations is going to go through an incredibly rough patch over the next year and I think it’s going to get so bad that we’re not sure that we can repair it. And that involves everything from Greenland to trade, tech fights over Twitter, and troop withdrawals. But I think that Europe comes out of this in some ways stronger and it may be actually beneficial to Europe in the long run.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I land where my colleagues land, which is I think that the transatlantic relationship will emerge from this period intact. So be patient. Don’t write us off. We will stick around.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-charles-kupchan-senior-fellow-council-on-foreign-relations&quot;&gt;– Charles Kupchan, Senior Fellow, Council on Foreign Relations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The burden sharing point is an old one. Multiple administrations have brought this to Europe with more or less success. His style is perhaps a little different, but nonetheless the message is not that much different, pay more do more, et cetera.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While U.S.-European relations are tumultuous today, panelists thought it would be a mistake to discount the lasting transatlantic alignment, even as the rules and expectations that may govern it will change. The relationship between the United States and Europe is defined by a shared history and deep economic, social, and cultural integration. Shared U.S.-European interests reveal that working together will yield benefits for both. And the core of the new cooperation could be energy security and innovation, where the two blocs have been aligned and able to cooperate across multiple administrations and presidencies. In the near term, such cooperation will likely require a more pragmatic, project-based, approach—where investments in infrastructure and technology innovation can realize benefits for both the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF SOUTHEAST EUROPE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central theme in the conversations was how countries in Europe could transform the now three-year energy crisis into an opportunity to establish a comprehensive, long-term, energy framework for the continent. The challenges to doing so are significant. Europeans still pay high prices for energy, and the threat of energy insecurity looms. The costs of investment in energy now must be weighed against the need to invest in economic security and reestablish a defense industrial base. And Europe maintains a legal and political mandate to respond to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panelists highlighted three key tools for addressing those challenges: policy alignment, innovation, and interconnection. On policy, panelists pointed to the need to align energy strategies at the European level, so that the 27 EU member countries could act together. With more cross-border mechanisms for exchanging energy, Europe can plan to use its resource endowments more efficiently, reducing costs and leveraging technology and markets to develop energy in line with climate goals. With sufficient interconnection, Europe could capture wind or solar when each is most available and reduce the high prices that have plagued smaller markets like those in eastern and southeastern Europe. In adding innovative energy storage technologies and complementary gas infrastructure, Europe can realize a more secure energy sector and economic competitiveness. To execute this will take the same level of coordination and commitment of purpose that Europe displayed after the 2021 energy crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A European approach to energy will have to extend beyond European borders. The conference’s location in Athens gave panelists the opportunity to explore the ever-changing geopolitical landscape in southeastern Europe and the role the region will play in broader energy and geopolitical events in the coming years. Greece already acts as a connecting point between the Mediterranean and the countries of eastern Europe, providing trade in oil and refined products, access to gas via the ports on the Mediterranean, and exports of plentiful electricity. As renewable capacity in the region increases, Greece also has the capacity to play a key role in the supply of clean electricity into Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;policymaker-highlight-nikos-tsafos-deputy-minister-of-energy&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Policymaker Highlight: Nikos Tsafos, Deputy Minister of Energy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“The challenge that we face is on the one hand we have a climate pressure, but we also have the pressure of energy costs and competitiveness. And so a big part of our job as policy makers is how do you juggle those different things? Because the more you do in one way, the more difficult it might be to do something else.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“The trouble for a country like Greece in thinking about the connectivity with especially essentially North Africa is the scale of North Africa is so much greater than what we can absorb. So if you bring electricity from Egypt and you just bring it to Greece, there’s just too much. So really for us, it’s about refashioning the European network.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several interconnections that will link southern Europe to North Africa and the Middle East are already being planned and promoted. These proposed interconnections will serve not just one market, but all of Europe via connections through countries like Greece. In shifting the conversation from supplying Greece to supplying much of Europe, regional and international connections will emphasize the significant political and geopolitical advances that come from deeper power integration. Large interconnections require trust, stability, and security at either end. And they can bring economic opportunity and investment to developing or conflict-damaged societies. By fostering energy partnerships across traditional boundaries, Europe has an opportunity to build more than infrastructure. It can build lasting frameworks for regional cooperation, economic development, and security. Southeastern Europe, and Greece, will be at the heart of this revolution. As Alexandros Paterakis of PPC has observed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Greece is where it is. It’s at the southeastern tip of Europe and it’s in the middle of the crossroads … whether it’s North Africa or Middle East, I think at this point in time there’s no going back. Integration or connectivity as we mentioned before will have to happen at this level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INNOVATION AND INTEGRATION: THE PATH FORWARD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, it has become increasingly evident that the economic frontier is heavily reliant on the expansion of the electricity system. The expansion of data centers to power artificial intelligence (AI) is the most immediate concern, as companies and countries are chasing opportunity in a brand new industry. Speaking of one recent PPC initiative in West Macedonia, Georgios Stassis remarked,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We announced just last week the development of a mega data center in the area of West Macedonia, an area where our former mines were located. Initially, our mega data center will have the capacity of 300 megawatts and gradually we’ll move to the level of 1,000 megawatts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on, however, is energy demand growth that will come from multiple sources. Improving productivity from AI portends potentially rapid economic growth and energy demand growth to match. Meanwhile, rerouting and reshoring manufacturing supply chains for defense, energy, and other products will accompany electrifying large parts of the economy in putting upward pressure on demand. The very same areas where Europe must invest to meet its economic, geopolitical, and energy priorities will put new demands on electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panelists in Athens emphasized the growing interconnectedness of the digital and energy economies, presenting both challenges and opportunities for Europe. One such opportunity lies in the convergence of these two sectors, which offers numerous avenues for generating efficiencies and new revenue streams, as well as balancing electricity grids with innovative economic activities. Data centers, anticipated to be substantial energy consumers, can contribute to both economic growth and geoeconomic cooperation with the United States, a global leader in this technology. As the infrastructure necessary for developing these data centers and providing them with power and digital infrastructure is constructed, new investment can go to redeveloping industrial areas to the benefit of local communities, countries, and the global community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-history-of-europes-grid-integration&quot;&gt;The History of Europe’s Grid Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European electricity grid is the largest interconnected transmission network in the world. It is overseen by the European Network of Transmission Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E), which comprises 40 member transmission system operators (TSOs) representing 36 countries (Figure 1). This integration originated across eight western European countries and was initially called the Union for the Coordination of Production and Transmission of Electricity (UCPTE). It arose out of the Marshall Plan, and its purpose was to ensure the most effective use of the limited energy resources remaining after the severe destruction of European infrastructure during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the UCPTE expanded to include additional western European countries throughout the 1980s, both political and technical constraints limited further west–east synchronous interconnection until 1995, when UCPTE integrated with the CENTREL group of power utilities comprising the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and, Slovakia. Further expansion to North Africa was realized in 1998 when a submarine cable was completed between Morocco and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current iteration of ENTSO-E was established in 2008 as part of a cooperative commitment acknowledging the intensive coordination needed between transmission operators, generators, legislators, regulators, researchers, and other stakeholders to meet the European Union’s newly announced “20-20-20” targets (20 percent decarbonization, 20 percent increase in share of renewable energy sources, and 20 percent improvement in energy efficiency by 2020).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, ENTSO-E spans over 550,000 kilometers of circuits comprising alternating current (AC) lines and cables and direct current (DC) cables. Cross-border exchanges within ENTSO-E member countries totaled almost 420 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2023, while exchanges between ENTSO-E member countries and external countries totaled 18 TWh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-vision-for-an-interconnected-mediterranean-grid&quot;&gt;A Vision for an Interconnected Mediterranean Grid&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012, 14 TSOs from 12 countries established the Association of the Mediterranean Transmission System Operators for electricity (Med-TSO) to use multilateral collaboration to facilitate the integration of the Mediterranean power systems and to foster security and socioeconomic development in the region. Today, it has expanded to include 20 TSOs from 20 Mediterranean countries (Figure 2), some of which are also ENTSO-E member countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has supported several of the recently completed and proposed future projects in the Med-TSO, in recognition of their benefits for energy security, renewable energy integration, and political and economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-case-for-further-integration&quot;&gt;The Case for Further Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;renewable-resources&quot;&gt;Renewable Resources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean region has untapped potential for deploying renewable energy sources. Harnessing these resources is essential both to decarbonize the Mediterranean region—where fossil fuels make up 65 percent of the energy mix in northern states and 92 percent in the south—and to generate clean electricity and hydrogen to export to the European Union to help meet Europe’s climate goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union’s “Fit for 55” laws obligate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 and require the European Union to be climate neutral by 2050. Among other provisions, Fit for 55 includes a revised renewable energy directive that increases the EU-level target of renewable energy sources in the overall energy mix from at least 32 percent to at least 40 percent by 2030. Additionally, Fit for 55 includes a hydrogen and decarbonized gas market package that aims to shift to 66 percent of natural gas demand being met by renewable and low-carbon gases, up from 5 percent today. To meet both of these targets, the European Union will have to rely on imported electricity and fuels from the Mediterranean region, where there is high renewable potential (Figure 4 and Figure 5) and a relatively high degree of available land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many countries in the southern Mediterranean region have ambition to expand renewable capacity, in part to mitigate climate impacts in the vulnerable region and in part to take advantage of opportunities to meet Europe’s clean energy demand. For example, Tunisia and Morocco have signed the Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency Pledge. The region has also supported the Pan-Arab Sustainable Energy Strategy 2030, which aims to reach 12.4 percent renewable energy share in the Arab region’s electricity mix. Furthermore, several of the countries in this region have submitted nationally determined contributions (NDCs) with renewable energy targets as part of the Paris Agreement (Table 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economics&quot;&gt;Economics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to helping to meet climate goals, grid integration between Europe and the Mediterranean will help reduce reliance on volatile natural gas markets and allow for more cost-effective integration of renewable resources with higher capacity factors in North Africa than in many parts of Europe. Additionally, interconnected grids facilitate price convergence across the connected regions, which will be economically favorable to countries with isolated grids and high costs of electricity, such as Cyprus. Grid integration also disadvantages countries with low electricity costs by causing local electricity prices to increase, although generally larger integrated markets are likely to drive innovation and efficiency gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Mediterranean region, integrating with Europe will allow for new export opportunities for green electricity and hydrogen, which will diversify and expand the economy while reducing dependence on traditional fossil fuel exports. Additionally, interconnection projects and associated infrastructure and supply chain development create jobs in manufacturing, installation, maintenance, and related services. Import demand from Europe also de-risks renewable energy projects, which can further attract foreign investment into the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security-reliability-and-resilience&quot;&gt;Security, Reliability, and Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest advantages of cross-border interconnections is the enhanced reliability of electricity supply; power outages are reduced, as failures of a generating unit can be immediately compensated for by neighboring systems. Integrated grids allow for easier ability to control frequency stability and voltage levels, as the total system can be controlled without each separate system having to maintain its own frequency. In an integrated setup, the total reserve capacity only needs to match the highest single-system loss, instead of each grid holding enough reserves to cover its own worst-case scenario. This is because power imbalances in one area can be offset by adjustments in generation or load elsewhere within the interconnected network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, longer-term reliability and resilience against both natural disasters and geopolitical tensions are strengthened by grid integration. A greater diversity of primary energy sources and more spatially dispersed generators contribute to greater supply security. For example, if one area is impacted by an extreme event that causes power disruptions, a geographically expansive network allows for the loss of generation to be supplemented by plants in other regions not impacted by the event. This will become especially important as the Mediterranean region increasingly experiences extreme heat and precipitation events exacerbated by climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recent-and-planned-integrations&quot;&gt;Recent and Planned Integrations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interconnecting energy systems is of great strategic importance. Europe is a leader in this field, with close to 12 percent of member states’ electricity consumption coming from a neighboring country. The EU target is to reach a cross-border capacity ratio of least 15 percent by 2030. Most recently, in 2022 Ukraine and Moldova’s grids were connected and synchronized; while this connection had already been planned for 2024, the project was expedited in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In February 2025, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania successfully disconnected from the Russian-controlled BRELL energy system and synchronized their electricity grids with Europe to strengthen their geopolitical position and boost long-term energy security and competitiveness. The synchronization initiative received over 1.2 billion euros in grants from the European Union’s Connecting Europe Facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further European grid expansion will primarily come in the form of new long-distance high-voltage transmission lines, primarily subsea cables. To meet the stated interconnection target while simultaneously meeting EU climate targets, many of these interconnections must link the European grid to Mediterranean countries with abundant renewable energy potential. The only current interconnection between Europe and North Africa is between Spain and Morocco, consisting of two cables with an expansion expected by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Med-TSO published a masterplan in 2022 that proposes 19 interconnection projects across five envisioned corridors (Figure 6):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Western Mediterranean Corridor (Algeria, Morocco, Portugal, Spain)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Central Mediterranean Corridor and North Africa Backbone (Algeria, Egypt, Italy, Libya, Tunisia)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;East Mediterranean Interconnectors (Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, Israel, Turkey)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eastern Balkan Corridor (Bulgaria, Italy, Greece, Turkey)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Middle East Mediterranean Integration (Egypt, Jordan, Palestine, Syria, Turkey)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The portfolio of interconnections is estimated to span about 10,000 kilometers of new transmission lines, allowing for almost 20 GW of new transfer capacity among Mediterranean countries. The flexibility from these interconnections is estimated to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 24 metric tons (MT) per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;integration-projects-planned-by-2030&quot;&gt;Integration Projects Planned by 2030&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the expansion of the Spain–Morocco interconnection, the planned projects anticipated to be completed by 2030 include the GREGY interconnection (linking Europe to Egypt), the Great Sea Interconnector (linking Europe to Israel), and the ELMED project (connecting Italy and Tunisia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GREGY: CLEAN ENERGY FROM EGYPT TO GREECE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GREGY is a proposed project to link Egypt to Europe via Greece by a 3,000-megawatt (MW) submarine cable spanning almost 1,000 kilometers. Once completed, the cable would carry renewable energy generated in Egypt and is estimated to displace 4.5 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year of natural gas consumption, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions by about 10 million MT annually. Approximately one third of the renewable electricity from Egypt would be used by Greece directly, while another third is anticipated to be used by Greece as input to produce low-carbon fuels; the final third will likely be transferred to other European countries. At an estimated cost of 4.2 billion euros, developers seek a final investment decision by the end of 2025 and to be fully operational by 2030. While not yet fully financed or green-lit, the project has already been included in the European Union’s Global Gateway initiative focused on mobilizing investments to promote sustainable infrastructure development in partner countries. GREGY is also under consideration as a European Commission project of mutual interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE GREAT SEA INTERCONNECTOR: CONNECTING GREECE, CYPRUS, AND ISRAEL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction on the Great Sea Interconnector subsea cable between Greece, Cyprus, and Israel (formerly called the EuroAsia Interconnector) began in December 2023 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2030 at an estimated cost of 2 billion euros. A grant of almost 660 million euros has been promised by the European Union toward the section connecting Cyprus with Crete. The two-way high-voltage direct current (HVDC) line will span over 1,200 kilometers at a depth of over 3,000 meters to deliver 2 GW of energy to Europe, supplying electricity to over 3 million homes. The idea of connecting the power grids between Greece, Cyprus, and Israel has been discussed for over a decade, primarily to mitigate energy security risks for Cyprus and Israel, which currently each operate under isolated grids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ELMED: CONNECTING ITALY AND TUNISIA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ELMED project would span almost 225 kilometers, 200 of which would be offshore at a depth of 800 meters. The interconnection is anticipated to reduce generation costs and renewable curtailment in Italy in the near term and allow Tunisia to export renewable energy to Europe in the long term. Studies have also shown that the interconnection would contribute to increased energy security and improved resilience of the Tunisian power system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;financing-europeanmediterranean-interconnection-projects&quot;&gt;Financing European–Mediterranean Interconnection Projects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While specific project costs vary depending on the length of the interconnection and the depth of the subsea cables, cost estimates for electricity grid projects connecting Europe to the Mediterranean are on the order of billions of euros. Commercial loans and equity investments are important funding mechanisms for electricity grid interconnection projects, but such large projects may also require government support. A range of financing mechanisms have been leveraged to raise capital from public sources, demonstrating the potential benefits of developing such infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EU FUNDING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Connecting Europe Facility for Energy is the main source of EU funding for energy interconnection projects. The European Union has allocated over 5.8 billion euros to the energy sector between 2021 and 2027 for projects that help the transition toward clean energy, with a focus on cross-border renewable energy projects, interoperability of networks, and better integration of the internal energy market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Union introduced a temporary instrument in 2021 called the Recovery and Resilience Facility, which designates over 180 billion euros for clean energy projects that help EU countries make critical reforms and investments needed to rapidly end their dependence on Russian fossil fuels. It also channels funding for the implementation of the REPowerEU plan to accelerate the clean energy transition and boost EU competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Investment Bank (EIB) plays a role in cross-border infrastructure projects. The EIB provided loans totaling 3.5 billion euros for cross-border electricity infrastructure from 2010 to 2022, covering 40 percent of these projects’ total investment costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) provides financing for transmission projects that support energy market interconnection and promote further regional integration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The African Development Bank (AfDB) invests in infrastructure projects to support economic development and regional integration, which includes financing electricity interconnection projects between North Africa and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has historically been an important source of financing for some large-scale interconnection projects in Europe, and especially Ukraine. It also invests in strategically important projects. In 2024, the DFC submitted a letter of intent to support the Great Sea Interconnector project.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The World Bank has supported energy infrastructure projects intended to expand regional integration. In 2023, the World Bank approved almost 270 million dollars in financing for the ELMED interconnector and support for Tunisia’s renewable energy trade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;legal-regulatory-and-market-barriers&quot;&gt;Legal, Regulatory, and Market Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant barriers to cross-border grid integration between Europe and the southern and eastern Mediterranean is navigating the different regulatory environments. Common market rules are needed to ensure fair competition, transparent and non-discriminatory network tariffs, proper cross-border trade mechanisms, congestion management, and capacity allocation mechanisms. The more market designs and rules between countries or regions differ, the more likely it is that trade is impeded or distorted between markets. Harmonizing or otherwise adjudicating electricity market regulations, standards, and energy policies is therefore a prerequisite for cross-border interconnection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has largely already unified under a common regulatory structure facilitated by the Agency for Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), which works toward developing common market rules and coordinating actions of national regulators. The EU electricity market is liberalized and predominately operates on a marginal pricing model. In contrast, the southern and eastern Mediterranean countries generally operate under less competitive markets and more vertically integrated utilities. In recognition of the importance of integration, the Association of Mediterranean Energy Regulators (MEDREG) is promoting harmonization of electricity markets and regulations across the region by bringing together regulators across 22 countries, but full harmonization will require drastic changes in the regulatory framework, market procedures, technical rules, and administrative measures. In the meantime, differences in markets and rules continue to present challenges to cross-regional grid integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technical-constraints&quot;&gt;Technical Constraints&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While several examples of successful electricity interconnections via subsea cables exist, it continues to be a technically complex undertaking. The subsea cable routes must be carefully surveyed to ensure the long-term security and stability of the cable and avoid any obstacles during construction. Additionally, laying the cables requires specialized vessels to install the cables at great depths and under high pressure. The cables themselves must be carefully engineered with advanced materials to withstand the harsh conditions and mitigate energy losses, mechanical stress, and risk of failure. Beyond the cables themselves, converting between the HVDC lines and AC grids requires complex power electronics and control systems. If the HVDC line is connecting to asynchronous grids, it must actively manage the power flow. Careful protection schemes and coordination mechanisms are also needed to account for the differences in characteristics between AC and DC lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;realizing-strategic-alignment&quot;&gt;Realizing Strategic Alignment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“One of the things that Europe needs to do with its energy policy within the context of transatlantic relations is identify initiatives that have bipartisan American support.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-gabriel-mitchell-policy-fellow-at-the-mitvim-institute&quot;&gt;– Gabriel Mitchell, Policy Fellow at the Mitvim Institute&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mediterranean energy interconnections solve multiple European challenges at once: They enhance security, build resilience, and make energy more affordable in markets hungry for clean power. These connections form the backbone of Europe’s energy security strategy in an increasingly competitive global landscape. For Mediterranean nations on both shores, these projects transform geographic location into strategic advantage, placing them at the center of emerging energy geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s energy crisis taught its leaders a painful lesson: Depending on a single supplier creates dangerous vulnerability. Now, as Europe builds a more determined energy strategy—one that delivers clean power at affordable prices—expanded interconnections offer a twofold benefit. They improve energy resilience while weakening Russia’s ability to weaponize its resources against European interests. This approach aligns perfectly with the United States’ long-standing goal of European energy independence, a policy that serves both economic and strategic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As leaders in Europe and the United States rethink transatlantic relations, European leaders must identify energy projects that can win U.S. support and engage regional powers. For the United States, supporting Europe’s energy independence through these interconnections makes perfect sense. Such infrastructure investments advance multiple American strategic interests: They can help countries recover from conflict, add to energy abundance and security in Europe, and promote economic development in the Middle East and North Africa. These aren’t merely power lines and pipelines—they’re pathways to stability, prosperity, and peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As generative AI technologies rapidly evolve, their implications for global information security are becoming more acute. This paper explores how Russian state-affiliated and state-aligned actors are discussing, conceptualising and framing AI within their online communications. Drawing on original analysis of communications from Russian-linked online channels, the paper investigates how actors in the Russian influence ecosystem perceive the role of AI in information warfare and what their narratives reveal about evolving threat trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report finds that a diverse range of Russian actors are actively engaged in conversations about AI. These actors are not only discussing the use of AI tools to automate and amplify content, but also exploring the role of AI as a narrative device, boasting of its effectiveness, warning of its dangers and framing it as both a strategic asset and a potential threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis reveals a growing focus on AI as both an opportunity and a threat among various Russian actors, from those affiliated with groups like Wagner, to pro-Russian hacktivist collectives and online influencers. AI is often portrayed as a powerful tool for information manipulation, capable of generating persuasive content, amplifying messaging and overwhelming adversaries with sheer volume. At the same time, many actors express significant anxiety about Western dominance over AI development, suggesting that these technologies could be used to subvert Russian public opinion, erode autonomy and destabilise the domestic information environment. Concerns about surveillance, deepfakes (digitally altered videos or images aiming to misrepresent a person as doing or saying something they did not say or do in the original version of the image or video) and algorithmic bias feature prominently in this discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The observed conversations are not confined to abstract speculation. The paper documents how state-affiliated and state-aligned actors are actively debating the implications of AI, sharing practical knowledge, critiquing disinformation practices and recruiting individuals with relevant technical skills. These insights point to an evolving culture of adaptation within Russian influence networks, where AI is increasingly seen as a central component of future-facing information operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the paper does not assess the inner workings of senior intelligence planning, it offers a unique actor-level perspective on how AI is entering the strategic imagination of Russian influence networks. These insights highlight the importance of not only tracking how AI might be operationalised in future disinformation efforts, but also understanding the ways in which it is already shaping how these actors think, communicate and position themselves within digital ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of generative AI has raised widespread concern over the potential exploitation of AI by malicious actors to disrupt information ecosystems. While early warnings about AI-generated disinformation primarily focused on its theoretical risks, recent evidence suggests that a range of actors are already incorporating these technologies into their influence operations. Understanding how such actors perceive, experiment with and deploy generative AI is essential to anticipating future threats and designing effective countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue is particularly pressing in the context of Russian information operations. The Russian government has long prioritised information warfare as a central element of statecraft, viewing the information domain as a theatre of conflict on par with conventional or nuclear warfare. Disinformation actors affiliated with the Russian state are thought to have invested heavily in AI technologies to influence European audiences in the run-up to the 2024 European Parliament elections. As generative AI becomes more accessible and more powerful, it lowers the barrier to entry for a wider ecosystem of pro-Russian actors, including state-linked media, hacktivists and online influencers, to experiment with and operationalise these tools in increasingly sophisticated ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the severity of this threat, understanding of disinformation and influence operations carried out by Russian state-affiliated actors remains limited. Current discussions focus on outputs, with less attention to how Russian-affiliated actors perceive or discuss the role of AI in influence campaigns. This paper seeks to address this gap by examining how Russian state-affiliated and state-aligned actors and groups – including state-linked social media groups and channels, hacktivist collectives, military-affiliated groups and online influencers – are discussing AI. The paper considers how AI might be a beneficial tool in their arsenal or supplement their existing techniques, tactics and activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper generates new insight into Russian disinformation and influence activities by scoping and analysing the online communications channels and information ecosystems of these actors and groups. In doing so, it analyses how actors within these spaces discuss AI, including their perceptions, understandings and knowledge of how this technology is currently used, and could be used for propaganda purposes. The paper presents a unique perspective on the current and future practices of Russian state-affiliated and state-aligned groups and their attempts to influence and polarise audiences and public opinions, with a particular focus on Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis is situated within a growing body of literature that explores AI-enabled influence operations, while offering a more actor-centric perspective. Rather than treating Russian disinformation as a monolithic, state-directed enterprise, the paper highlights the heterogeneity of actors involved and the diverse, and sometimes contradictory, ways in which they engage with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the paper focuses on tactical and mid-level actors, it does not attempt to map the strategic or doctrinal thinking of the intelligence managers or decision-makers responsible for designing operations at the highest levels. Such insights are beyond the scope of open-source social media monitoring. Instead, the report contributes to a more granular understanding of how AI is being perceived, discussed and operationalised by those within the broader Russian influence ecosystem, and how these evolving practices reflect emerging threats at the operational and narrative level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;METHODOLOGY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper employs a qualitative research design to explore how Russian state-affiliated and state-aligned actors and groups discuss and deploy generative AI in the context of influence operations. The analysis draws primarily on data collected through ExTrac AI’s state-of-the-art AI-powered platform. ExTrac AI enables the automatic collection, refinement and analysis of data and multimedia materials from tens of thousands of hard-to-reach but publicly available sources daily, including communications ecosystems associated with disinformation actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was carried out in three phases, starting with a scoping phase to identify key actors, channels and keywords related to AI and disinformation. Using ExTrac AI’s search capabilities, relevant channels were selected based on existing research on Russian influence operations, prior tagging on the platform, and results from initial keyword searches. Keywords included terms in both Russian and English. This stage provided an initial mapping of the online ecosystem of actors engaging with AI and set the foundation for subsequent analytical stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second stage, content analysis was conducted across a broader dataset, including searches over different time periods and across multiple groups. The terms and themes identified in the scoping phase were used to assess the prevalence and scope of AI-related discourse. Posts were examined to evaluate the degree of interest in AI, the level of technical or operational knowledge demonstrated and the types of narratives emerging around the use of AI for disinformation purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on insights from the initial analysis, specific case studies were then selected for further in-depth examination. These case studies focused on particular actors (such as Wagner-affiliated channels and hacktivist groups like NoName057(16)) and explored how AI was discussed and applied within their disinformation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these three stages provided a structured and iterative approach to understanding the perceptions, use cases and strategic considerations of AI within Russian-aligned disinformation networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-strategic-thinking-on-information-warfare-and-ai&quot;&gt;RUSSIAN STRATEGIC THINKING ON INFORMATION WARFARE AND AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess current and emerging disinformation threats, it is essential to understand how Russian state and military doctrine conceptualises information warfare, and how AI fits within this strategic framework. This section outlines: the foundations of Russian thinking on information confrontation and AI; actors active in this space; and operational practices integrating AI into disinformation operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-foundations-of-russian-information-warfare&quot;&gt;STRATEGIC FOUNDATIONS OF RUSSIAN INFORMATION WARFARE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Russia, information warfare, or “information confrontation” as it is known in Russian doctrine, holds strategic importance which is equivalent to conventional and nuclear warfare, even in peacetime. The information domain is treated as integral to national security and geopolitical influence. While Russia rarely acknowledges cyber operations against Western targets, it also avoids directly denying them, using plausible deniability as a strategic asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian information strategy prioritises intelligence collection, often through espionage or cyber intrusion, alongside information-psychological influence targeting individuals and mass audiences. This dual focus enables the systematic collection of data while also strengthening efforts to shape political discourse and decision-making domestically and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian disinformation campaigns aim to undermine adversaries by exacerbating internal divisions, eroding trust in democratic institutions, and weakening alliances such as NATO or the EU. This complicates unified responses to Russian actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although many of these campaigns are under-resourced and disorganised, social media platforms allow for low-cost, large-scale experimentation without significant consequence for failed attempts. Trial and error approaches carry little risk, and the volume of content often matters more than precision. Ironically, Western media portrayals of Russian cyber capabilities may amplify their perceived effectiveness, reinforcing Moscow’s intended image as a highly sophisticated cyber power, and thereby amplifying the perceived threat even when the operational impact is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian disinformation ecosystem is diverse, encompassing official state entities, state-funded media outlets, proxy organisations, ideologically-driven individuals and commercially-motivated journalists and bloggers. Some operate within formal command structures, while others emerge organically, driven by personal initiative but aligning with perceived Kremlin goals. This decentralised approach provides the Russian state plausible deniability while enabling tailored and flexible messaging that resonates with different audiences without the need for a unified narrative, as would be the case with clearly attributed government communications. A clear example of this decentralised model is evident in Wagner’s information operations in Africa, where the group intentionally outsourced its messaging to local activists, journalists and online influencers. These actors are often not directly controlled by Wagner but align with it ideologically or are incentivised to support its narratives. These actors allow Wagner to avoid overt branding while achieving narrative resonance, political deniability and operational cost-effectiveness in contested media environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the state level, Russian intelligence agencies, particularly Russia’s military intelligence service (GRU), play a central role in orchestrating cyber-enabled influence operations. Two of the GRU’s most prominent cyber-focused units, 26165 and 74455, commonly referred to in Western cybersecurity reporting as APT28 (Fancy Bear) and APT29 (Cozy Bear), are implicated in cyber and information operations against foreign targets, including election interference, strategic hacking campaigns and social media influence operations. While these advanced persistent threat actors (APTs) conduct technical operations like intrusions or data theft, they rarely serve as the public face of Russian cyber activity. Instead, hacktivist groups often act as intermediaries, repackaging and disseminating information obtained by APTs to obscure attribution. Factors such as the timing of leaks, shared technical infrastructure, and instances where hacktivist groups claim responsibility for an operation before it has been publicly attributed to an APT often suggest coordination. This interplay allows the Russian state to expand influence while diffusing risk and complicating attribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, proxy media outlets such as Strategic Culture Foundation, Global Research, New Eastern Outlook, News Front, SouthFront, Katehon and Geopolitica.ru function as multipliers of Russia’s narratives abroad. They extend Russia’s messaging reach abroad by reproducing and legitimising disinformation narratives without requiring direct Kremlin oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ai-as-an-enabler-of-disinformation&quot;&gt;AI AS AN ENABLER OF DISINFORMATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has identified AI as a strategic domain. Russia’s 2019 national strategy for the development of AI committed the country to global leadership in AI by 2030. Russian officials frame AI as both an opportunity and a threat. Officials express concern that Western AI tools could manipulate Russian public opinion, introduce ideological bias, or even catalyse regime change. These concerns reinforce Russia’s belief in AI’s capacity to enable cognitive manipulation and encourage internal destabilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, the Kremlin has prioritised a sovereign AI ecosystem, coordinated by the National Centre for AI Development. State-owned enterprises, such as Sberbank and Rostec, dominate the field. Sberbank’s GigaChat platform, which is presented as Russia’s answer to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, is a flagship initiative, serving as both a technological benchmark and an instrument for state AI policy – with Sberbank being tasked with implementing Russia’s AI roadmap and the national strategy for the development of AI. Rostec focuses on defence applications, while Yandex (creator of YandexGPT) – despite its leading AI capabilities – plays a secondary role due to its complicated relationship with the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generative AI is already being integrated into Russian disinformation operations. Automated tools generate fake articles, social media posts, images and deepfakes. Operations like the “DoppelGänger” campaign, in which AI-generated articles mimicked legitimate Western news outlets, illustrate how these tactics aim to erode trust and sow confusion at scale. AI-powered bots and automated social media accounts help amplify disinformation, saturate public discourse and simulate grassroots sentiment – a tactic known as “astroturfing”. In some cases, fake conversations between bots are staged to simulate debate and mislead third-party observers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian actors are also exploring large language model (LLM) grooming: injecting of propaganda or biased material into training data to influence the outputs of LLMs. Designed to skew the outputs of LLMs, this tactic represents a shift from targeting audiences directly to subtly shaping the tools these audiences use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the use of generative AI in disinformation is still evolving, it is increasingly seen by Russian actors as a force multiplier, automating content production, overwhelming adversaries and further blurring the boundary between truth and fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mapping-ai-related-discourse-in-russian-influence-networks&quot;&gt;MAPPING AI-RELATED DISCOURSE IN RUSSIAN INFLUENCE NETWORKS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section draws on primary data gathered through the ExTrac AI platform to examine how Russian state-affiliated and state-aligned actors discuss, conceptualise and operationalise generative AI technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;knowledge-of-and-familiarity-with-ai-tools&quot;&gt;KNOWLEDGE OF AND FAMILIARITY WITH AI TOOLS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the discussions under review reveals a strong and growing interest among Russian actors in the capabilities of AI, particularly as a tool in disinformation campaigns and broader strategic communication. While much of the discourse references the military applications of AI, especially the integration of AI with drone operations, there are frequent and direct acknowledgements of its value for information operations and manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous Telegram channels express pride in sophisticated Russian information operations, explicitly citing the use of AI-driven tools. Some channels even frame AI as central to training a new generation of cyber operatives, which reflects their intent to further establish and institutionalise AI within the disinformation apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, these actors also mock and ridicule Western media coverage of Russian AI-driven interference. For example, in response to Western media reports accusing Russian actors of running German-language influence campaigns, some posts sarcastically questioned who in Russia could possibly speak German well enough to do so, humorously implying direct involvement of Vladimir Putin himself, given his German language skills. Actors dismiss reports from German or other European news outlets about Russian cyber and AI-driven influence operations as exaggerated or fabricated, portraying these accusations as attempts by Western governments to deflect attention from domestic political failures. Such derisive dismissals aim to undermine the credibility of Western reports while reinforcing an internal narrative that Russia’s influence operations effectively unsettle Western governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, alongside bravado and dismissiveness, the observed discussions also reveal a certain level of underlying distrust and paranoia about AI technologies. A range of concerns were expressed, from existential anxieties about the future capabilities of AI to practical fears about the immediate implications of AI technologies. For instance, posts expressed anxieties regarding the ability of AI to rapidly and convincingly reproduce human personalities, seeing this as a dystopian threat capable of gradually replacing humans altogether. Another fear expressed involves the potential creation of artificial superintelligence (ASI), with actors describing scenarios in which routine human activities are rapidly replaced by AI agents and predicting that AI systems will achieve human-level intelligence, eventually culminating in an entirely AI-controlled society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other concerns are more immediate and pragmatic. For example, the inclusion of the former US NSA director, Paul Nakasone, on OpenAI’s board was widely interpreted as proof of the ongoing militarisation of AI. Actors suggested that all interactions with OpenAI systems could now (potentially) be subject to surveillance and exploitation by US military intelligence. These narratives demonstrate both familiarity with ongoing AI developments in the West and heightened anxiety about losing control over these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, Ukraine is often framed by channels as a testing ground for AI-enabled psychological influence operations, mass surveillance and propaganda by Western intelligence agencies. For example, channels point to supposedly AI-generated intercepted communications between Russian soldiers and their relatives, deepfake videos falsely attributed to Russian officials, and manipulative social media campaigns, arguing that these represent coordinated psychological operations designed to weaken Russian resolve and morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, specific examples like the DoppelGänger campaign are framed ambiguously, with some channels insisting such campaigns represent false flags orchestrated by Western intelligence in collaboration with Russian opposition figures, thus reinforcing narratives of victimhood and external aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such concerns have led Russian-aligned actors to call explicitly for improved information literacy among the Russian public. Frequent warnings are posted urging vigilance against perceived Western deepfake operations and manipulative content. Channels regularly publish reminders for followers to verify information rigorously, while remaining sceptical of unofficial sources and relying primarily on state-sanctioned media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;framing-and-function-of-ai-tools&quot;&gt;FRAMING AND FUNCTION OF AI TOOLS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the online communities under review, AI tools are framed as essential components in an intensifying information conflict. Telegram channels present AI as not only a technological innovation but a civic duty, encouraging skilled individuals to contribute to national efforts. Recruitment calls often target AI-literate users to contribute their skills to the groups’ goals, in line with Russia’s perceived interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one Telegram channel actively recruits contributors with experience in generative AI tools, stating: “Are you a neural network artist? [Redacted: name of channel] needs you! Our team is developing and the number of tasks is growing every month. We are looking for artists already working with Stable Diffusion (AUTOMATIC1111+ControlNet) and Midjourney … who understand the principles of industrial engineering and can control generation rather than rely on luck.” Similarly, another recruitment message from the same channel details its broad range of desirable recruits, including “neuroevangelists and text generation specialists”, emphasising that the project’s activities extend beyond graphics into sophisticated textual manipulation and generation. The channel describes its project as fundamentally reliant on human capital – including talented analysts, informants, and digital intelligence enthusiasts – highlighting collaborative “brainstorming” and diverse expertise spanning geospatial intelligence and open-source intelligence. The channel actively appeals to individuals who can navigate complex international information environments and generate persuasive narratives which are supportive of Russian military and geopolitical objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another central topic in the observed discourse is the centrality of the information war as a part of contemporary conflict and national security. For instance, promotional materials for the “Army-2024” Forum’s roundtable emphasised the importance of understanding how advanced digital technologies, including AI, can shape societal perceptions in the context of Russia’s “Special Military Operation” in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Telegram channels frame AI tools as instrumental resources for safeguarding Russia’s digital space against external threats. For example, one channel under review describes itself as a community of “highly qualified specialists in cybersecurity, information technology, and social research”, dedicated explicitly to “neutralising threats, disinformation, and propaganda”. These discussions portray AI as a tool of not only offence but also defence, used to identify, counter and neutralise foreign influence operations allegedly targeting Russian society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;perceived-limitations-and-barriers&quot;&gt;PERCEIVED LIMITATIONS AND BARRIERS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite significant enthusiasm surrounding the strategic integration of AI into information warfare, the monitored online communities also expressed substantial criticism and frustration regarding the limitations of Russia’s domestic AI platforms, primarily Sberbank’s GigaChat and YandexGPT. These criticisms reflect broader anxieties about technological autonomy, ideological biases and operational constraints, as well as suspicions regarding the political loyalties of major Russian tech firms (particularly Yandex). A recurring critique is that these models reflect liberal or “unpatriotic” biases. For instance, Sber GigaChat has been accused by users of showing favourable attitudes toward figures such as Lenin and Trotsky; one post complained that the platform “cannot condemn their betrayal of Russia and the Red Terror”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more concerning for these actors is the platforms’ handling of politically sensitive topics, especially those involving Russian territorial claims. YandexGPT and Sber GigaChat have both faced accusations of failing to confirm that Crimea and the recently annexed “new regions” are part of Russia. Posts shared anecdotes in which the AI would either avoid such questions or suggest changing the topic, which was interpreted by users as evasive and subversive. One user sarcastically noted that “Sber GigaChat is starting to freeze even when asked questions like ‘which regions by the sea would Russians like to move to’ (because Crimea is on the list)”. While later Telegram discussions noted an improvement, highlighting that “Gigachat already cheerfully answers that Crimea and Sevastopol have become part of Russia”, Yandex continues to be accused of intentionally misrepresenting sensitive facts about Ukraine as well as misrepresenting historical events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reluctance to reproduce state-endorsed positions and narratives has led to accusations that platforms like YandexGPT are either deliberately undermining Russia or are bound to foreign interests – a matter that users think should be escalated to the level of Russia’s Security Council for intervention. As one Telegram post stated: “Yandex GPT and Alisa still cannot be forced to confirm the constitutional norm about Russian Crimea … Russian developers are not so Russian, and the enemy who is waging the main – mental – war with us is not outside, but inside our country”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other domestic platforms have faced similar allegations. Megafon’s chatbot, for instance, was criticised for classifying Crimea and the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics as Ukrainian territories, allegedly because the underlying AI architecture relies on foreign-developed technologies such as Midjourney and GPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond ideological concerns, practical limitations possessed by Russian tools, when compared to Western tools such as ChatGPT, were another major source of frustration discussed in the observed channels. Users complained that Russian services were less responsive, provided inferior responses or declined to address neutral and factual questions that similar Western tools would answer. One post elaborated, saying, “let’s take YandexGPT … this prototype of AI is a terrible coward and does not answer quite ordinary questions … On the one hand, this greatly undermines trust in Yandex and its products. On the other hand, it gives grounds not only to recognize Yandex’s services as incomplete, but even [to recognise] the current managers … as foreign agents.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These perceived shortcomings undermine Russia’s stated goals of achieving digital and technological sovereignty. Ironically, pro-Russian actors’ dissatisfaction with domestic AI has led to a continued preference for Western tools, which undermines the Kremlin’s narrative of building a successful autonomous and ideologically-aligned AI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-studies&quot;&gt;CASE STUDIES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand how these discussions around AI translate into practical influence operations, this section presents an analysis of two key actor groups: Wagner-affiliated channels and Russian state-aligned hacktivist collectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wagner-affiliated-channels&quot;&gt;WAGNER-AFFILIATED CHANNELS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner, the Russian state-funded private military company known for its roles in Ukraine, including its early involvement in the Donbas war, its recruitment of prison inmates, and its central role in the Battle of Bakhmut, has also supported authoritarian regimes in Syria, Libya, the Central African Republic, and Mali. In Africa, its operations have often involved exchanging security services for access to resource concessions, particularly in the mining sector. The group has been repeatedly accused of serious human rights abuses, including torture, extrajudicial killings, and war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel with its military activity, Wagner is also highly active in the information warfare space. Channels affiliated with Wagner on Telegram and other semi-public platforms reveal significant engagement with generative AI technologies. They position these technologies as tools to undermine trust in Western institutions, sow discord among populations in the West and frame any Russian cyber activities as defensive responses to perceived Western aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the reviewed discussions in Wagner-linked channels contained critiques of poorly organised and ineffective Russian attempts at information warfare that relied on impulsive actions rather than systematic, intelligence-driven methods. This included, for example, criticism of low quality, AI-generated images and videos intended to blur reality. Critics argued that poorly executed efforts damage credibility and limit the effectiveness of genuine operations; as one post put it: “Information confrontation is necessary, but it must be done wisely – not in such a way as to report to the top for the sake of a tick”. This commentary reflects Wagner’s framing of itself as a disciplined, professional actor that values careful, intelligence-based planning – as opposed to careless disinformation and impulsive or amateur operations (which, they argue, risk undermining broader strategic efforts). By portraying other actors as ineffective, Wagner reinforces its own claim to be a capable and credible partner in Russia’s information warfare architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter enemy influence in the information space and build up resilience among Wagner’s operatives and audiences, Wagner-linked channels promote education in psychological operations and information warfare. They advertise courses and certifications offered by Wagner-affiliated figures designed to help their supporters identify enemy psychological tactics, detect fake content and improve strategic communications literacy. One teaching aid distributed in early 2025 stated: “I tried to collect the most common methods the enemy uses daily … this teaching aid briefly outlines the essence of the information war and the main methods for recognising fake materials. After studying this manual, you will learn to recognise and counter manipulation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner-linked channels also actively encourage their members to familiarise themselves with ongoing AI developments, highlighting, for example, advancements toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) and ASI, and discussing the potential strategic implications of these emerging technologies. They share practical information about new AI tools such as Google Labs’ image generation tool Whisk, explaining its potential operational applications and highlighting how AI-generated content can be strategically used in their activities. At the operational level, Wagner channels have discussed incorporating AI bots for moderation, as well as exploring the creation of bespoke AI chatbots modelled on popular or authoritative Wagner-affiliated figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Wagner-linked channels also express warnings about potential adversarial use of AI, particularly highlighting threats posed by AI-generated deepfakes designed to undermine Wagner operations internationally. For instance, Wagner-linked channels alerted followers to attempts to discredit Wagner’s presence in the Sahel using AI-generated images. Wagner-linked channels also drew attention to deepfake operations aimed at undermining regional authorities in Kursk, and to AI-generated audio used by Ukrainian forces to psychologically target Russian soldiers and their families. As one Wagner-affiliated channel warned: “A deepfake was posted by Ukrainian TsIPsO [ЦІПСО – referring to Ukraine’s Centre for Information and Psychological Operations] … they trained a neural network quickly with just one short video. The pipeline of deepfakes will soon escalate; remain vigilant.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another case discussed in the observed channels involved claims that the French Cyber Defence Command trained Ukrainian and Polish cyber units specifically to target Wagner operations in Mali and elsewhere. These channels reported that the operations were part of a wider Western effort to weaponise AI against Russia and Russian interests. These warnings are simultaneously contributing to a heightened sense of alertness, and amplifying the narrative of being under constant threat by hostile powers – serving to justify campaigns against the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further complicating Wagner’s relationship with AI are controversies where AI-generated content has reportedly been misused to manipulate or misrepresent Russian domestic perspectives. In one widely discussed case, a controversial statement, supposedly from State Duma Deputy Alexander Borodai, was dismissed as an AI-generated fake after it described frontline volunteers as “spare people”. Wagner-linked channels leaned into the controversy by sarcastically noting that the “neural network Borodai” had simply revealed the unvarnished truth of elite opinion. This ambiguity, blending satire with critique, illustrates Wagner’s complex relationship with the Russian state as well as its engagement with AI as both a powerful tool and a potential liability in the struggle over narrative control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its operational focus, Wagner’s discourse around AI often reinforces a metanarrative of elite competence. Channels often contrast Wagner’s disciplined, intelligence-led approach to information warfare with what they describe as amateurish or ideologically confused efforts by other Russian actors. For example, commenting on the Russian information campaign “Dozor”, one channel member commented, “this initiative will do more harm than good … the activity is poorly organized, there is no systematic approach … All these games with telegram bots are not the level of the challenges we face. Until this work is organized and set up properly, it is unlikely that anything will work out”. In this framing, Wagner positions itself as a pioneer of modern Russian information operations: technologically literate, strategically minded, and better equipped to utilise the full potential of AI than other actors who are constrained by bureaucracy or political leanings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hacktivist-groups&quot;&gt;HACKTIVIST GROUPS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro-Russian hacktivist collectives – many of which operate either under the direction of, or in strategic alignment with, state intelligence entities such as the GRU, the external intelligence agency (SVR), and the state security agency (FSB) – form another important component of Russia’s broader influence and cyber-operations ecosystem. Prominent groups include Zarya, Cyber Army of Russia (also known by other aliases such as the People’s Cyber Army or Cyber Army of Russia Reborn), Solntsepek, Beregini and RaHDit, and NoName057(16), and appear to have ties to APT units such as APT44 (GRU Unit 74455).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These groups often target anti-disinformation organisations, independent media and strategic infrastructure, particularly in Ukraine and other parts of Europe, framing these actions as retaliatory strikes against Western “information aggression”. For example, in May 2024, the Cyber Army of Russia attacked the website of Ukraine’s Centre for Combating Disinformation, justifying its actions as retaliation against perceived Ukrainian misinformation about incidents in Belgorod: “We must make every effort to teach them a lesson in poisoning the information space with cynical lies about yesterday’s shelling of a residential building in Belgorod.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond conducting attacks, these groups also exploit the symbolic value of media attention. For example, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaigns which receive significant Western media coverage, such as the temporary disruption of the official website of Slovenia’s president, are showcased as major victories, regardless of their technical or strategic significance. Screenshots of affected websites are circulated as digital trophies that are intended to boost morale among their supporters and signal success, both internally and to the groups’ adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important part of these groups’ modus operandi is the sharing of knowledge, resources and technical expertise. For instance, they highlight and promote platforms, such as HackerGPT, which are explicitly tailored to aid Russian-aligned hackers and which provide databases of techniques, tools and strategies designed to facilitate effective cyber operations. Other resources disseminated in hacktivist channels include comprehensive repositories on hacking, tutorials on generative AI, and lists of AI tools for different purposes. The aim is to cultivate a technically literate, decentralised cyber force, capable of sustaining long-term operations with minimal central oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hacktivist group NoName057(16) exemplifies the convergence of AI and cyber operations. Since emerging in early 2022, NoName057(16) has openly discussed AI as a force multiplier for DDoS attacks, misinformation campaigns, and reputational sabotage. The group positions generative AI predominantly as an operational enhancer rather than a standalone capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group demonstrates awareness of international research and reports analysing its influence operations. The channel actively references external reports, such as Google’s researchers identifying AI as a principal source of online misinformation, treating them as external validation of their operational effectiveness. This engagement with adversarial reporting and scrutiny blurs the line between propaganda and performance, creating a feedback loop where Western scrutiny is co-opted to reinforce the group’s narrative of impact and relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When alleged members of the group were arrested in Spain in mid-2024, NoName057(16) framed the incident as a symptom of a broader European “witch hunt”, driven by what they described as “Russophobic authorities”. This narrative serves to reinforce group cohesion and present their activities as legitimate resistance against unjustified Western persecution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, NoName057(16) actively cultivates its public identity through interviews, digests, and multi-language media products, positioning itself as a committed actor in Russia’s information war. Its Telegram channels call for ongoing cyber operations using AI, provide tools and guides to users, and foster a sense of community built around technical skill and ideological conviction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this report has shown, generative AI is no longer a concern of the future, but an active component of ongoing Russian-aligned influence operations. A range of actors are already engaging with AI not only as a tool to amplify their content, but also as a conceptual and strategic asset. These actors are debating the potential of AI, educating their followers and supporters in its use, and integrating it into broader narratives of geopolitical struggle and digital sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian discourse around AI reveals both strategic opportunism and deep insecurity. AI is praised for its ability to scale and personalise disinformation, automate content generation and reduce attribution risks. At the same time, there is widespread concern about the militarisation of Western AI, the ideological bias of foreign-developed tools, and the perceived failure of Russian platforms to align with the state’s messaging priorities. This reflects a broader tension in Russia’s approach: while seeking to dominate the information space, it remains dependent on digital tools and infrastructures it does not control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis highlights that generative AI is not simply being used to upgrade existing disinformation techniques. Instead, it is shaping how influence operations are developed, legitimated and operationalised. Wagner’s use of AI-enhanced educational materials, its criticism of low-quality content and its call for strategic discipline all suggest a professionalisation of the information war. Meanwhile, hacktivist groups like NoName057(16) emphasise AI as a force multiplier for grassroots cyber operations, embedding it into decentralised campaigns aimed at overwhelming and destabilising Western digital infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These trends have several policy and security implications. First, the fusion of AI and influence operations reinforces the need for AI governance frameworks that explicitly address malign use cases, not only in terms of content generation, but also in relation to model training, access and deployment. Second, the decentralised and multilingual nature of Russian- aligned influence networks highlights the importance of monitoring actor discourse, including strategic framing and planning discussions, across various platforms, rather than just focusing on outputs, such as disinformation posts or fake media content. Without this monitoring, the ability to anticipate emerging tactics and narratives is significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a need to support civil society and media ecosystems that are directly targeted by these operations. Aside from protecting them from AI-enabled attacks, investment in digital literacy and resilience programming against synthetic content and manipulated narratives is also necessary. Given the pace of AI development, coordination between governments, platforms, researchers and journalists must also happen at a larger scale. This should include sharing insights on observed tactics and uses of AI tools, as well as behaviours of threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this report demonstrates that AI is reshaping, but not replacing, the mechanics and logic of Russian disinformation. AI acts as an amplifier, enabling greater reach, faster response and more dynamic narrative adaptation. But it also introduces new vulnerabilities, contradictions and frictions within Russian influence networks themselves. Understanding and engaging with these internal dynamics will be important to inform future policy design and the development of effective countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

Any such transformation is nearly impossible without the involvement of the domestic opposition, and as Antonio Giustozzi, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) argues, it is too ideologically divided — from monarchists to radical leftists — to unite around a common cause. He concludes that, most likely, the fall of the ayatollahs would not lead to a new democratic awakening, but to a full-scale collapse of the Iranian state.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether the ceasefire between Iran and Israel will hold. In any case, we have not seen the end of Israel’s covert operations in Iran. Questions about regime change, much talked about over the last two weeks, will likely remain on the agenda. The Islamic Republic has certainly been shaken, and so it is worth asking: what are the opposition forces present in the country, how well organised are they, and can they unite for long enough to have a decisive impact on developing events?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-shahs-heir-and-a-us-favorite&quot;&gt;The Shah’s heir and a U.S. favorite&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the media’s focus has centered on the supporters of Reza Pahlavi, the heir to the throne of the monarchy that was abolished by the 1979 revolution. The Pahlavi clan is openly supported by Israeli prime minister Netanyahu, and in return, they supported Israel’s attack. They are also close to the Americans, not least because Reza is based there and has been actively lobbying American policymakers and congressmen. Much of the Iranian diaspora is made up of people who are associated with the monarchy in one way or another, so it is no surprise that Pahlavi enjoys high support among them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What matters, however, is how much support Pahlavi enjoys inside Iran, a question that is much harder to answer. During the demonstrations of 2022-2023, Pahlavi supporters were clearly active and visible, but even their foreign sympathisers admit that they are poorly organised, with Reza himself having a poor track record as a manager and leader. They are also divided internally — between those nostalgic for the old, authoritarian monarchy and those supporting the new course inaugurated by Reza in 2011, which leaves the issue of monarchical restoration undetermined and promises a liberal, democratic, and inclusive government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Reza’s new course has made the Pahlavis and their supporters more acceptable as partners to other opposition groups, there are still many anti-ayatollah forces who do not trust them — or who actively dislike them. To the extent that others in the opposition are ready to accept working with them, is it likely to be largely due to the perception that that may be the only route to gaining the kind of external support that may be required to ultimately have any chance of overthrowing the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-old-opposition&quot;&gt;The old opposition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several other older opposition groups that operate in much the same way as the Pahlavi supporters — that is, just beneath the surface, lacking any real underground structure (or at least, that’s the way they operate according to sources in the IRGC). Among them are various groups inspired by the figure of Mohammad Mossadeq, the prime minister who was overthrown in 1953 via an allegedly UK- and US-sponsored coup, which eventually led to the restoration of the absolute monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important of these movements are the Jabhe Milli (National Front) and the Nezhat Azadi Iran (Freedom Movement of Iran), though it does not appear that either are influential outside of some select intellectual circles. The same applies to the various groups that split off from the Islamic Republic, such as the Sazman Mujahidin Enqelab Islami Iran (Organization of the Mujahedin of the Islamic Revolution of Iran), a leftist-Islamist group that was outlawed in 2009. More influential appears to be the reformist Green Movement, which was the protagonist of the 2009 protests. The security apparatus of the Islamic Republic monitors these groups, but up to now it has not made any noticeable effort to eradicate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nmxmn85.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ “Green Movement” protests&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the remnants of the old left, which did not take up arms against the Khomeinists in the early 1980s but were outlawed nonetheless. Of these groups, the Tudeh (Communist Party) might have the largest underground networks, with perhaps 2,000 members, according to an IRGC source. The main faction of the Feda’yan Khalq, which aligned with the Tudeh while other factions waged an armed revolt, also maintains a modest underground presence. As with the other groups mentioned above, the security apparatus monitors these, but the authorities do not seem too worried about the threat they might represent. The leftists are certainly not likely to join hands with the supporters of the Pahlavis, whom they bitterly opposed up to and during the 1978-9 revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One component of the “old opposition” that has long been ready to join hands with the Americans — and which might accept an opportunity to discreetly cooperate with the Israelis, though not with the Pahlavis — is the Mojahedin-e-Khalq (MEK, lit. “People’s Mujahidin”), which was the most active violent opposition group against the Islamic Republic in the early 1980s before being crushed and forced to flee to Iraq, where it allied with Saddam Hussein until the end of the Iran-Iraq war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QvlL0EJ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Mojahedin-e-Khalq activists&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MEK have not had any armed presence inside Iran for over 30 years (except perhaps for a short-lived effort in 2022), but the IRGC estimated in 2019 that they maintain an underground network inside Iran of about 3,000 members. Thousands more are in exile abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Trump administration (and in particular John Bolton, when he was National Security Advisor) were courting the MEK before the supporters of the Pahlavis became Washington’s favourites. The MEK are in any case very unpopular in Iran due to the fact that they aligned with Saddam Hussein during the war with Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ethnic-movements&quot;&gt;Ethnic movements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these groups compete for the support of the 60% or so of Iranians who are Persian speakers. There appears to be no significant organised opposition group active among the country’s main minority, the Azeris (16%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkiye’s Grey Wolves have long tried to infiltrate the region and might have gained some support among those harboring anti-Kurdish sentiments (Kurds and Azeris co-exist in Iran’s West Azerbaijan Province). There is also a long tradition of opposition to the central powers in Tehran coming from among smaller minorities, such as the Kurds and Baluchis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kurds have a significant underground presence among the Sunni Kurdish population and also boast a number of armed groups based in Iraq. Among those believed to be most popular inside Iranian Kurdistan is the Hizb Demokratik Kurdistan Iran (Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan), even if it is well past its peak period of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It mostly operated in the tribal parts of Iranian Kurdistan but also in the city of Mahabad. The IRGC reckoned in 2019 that the party maintains a strong presence, especially in the Shno area (where Iran’s borders with Turkiye and Iraq meet), with up to 900 activists. Up to 2,000 of its most active members have taken refuge in Iraq, according to Kurdish opposition sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the leftist KOMALA is based in Iraq and maintains underground activities in Iran. According to the IRGC, the latter group controls around 450 armed militants along the border. Notably, KOMALA played a significant role in the 2005 urban uprising in Mahabad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the Kurds, the two groups that have the best prepared fighters are the PAK (Parti Azadi Kurdistan) and the PJAK (Partiya Jiyana Azade Kurdistane, or Kurdistan Free Life Party). The PAK, which was formed by radical leftists in 1991, participated in the campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq. The IRGC estimates the group’s strength at 400 fighters, who are based in Iraq. Inside Iran it has engaged in some underground activities in the areas of Kermanshah and Illam, but it has not been active there militarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Zneuumt.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Women in the ranks of the PAK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the PJAK is the only Kurdish group to have carried out significant armed activities inside Iran over the last 20 years, but it is mostly known to be linked to the Turkish PKK. The IRGC in 2019 rated the PJAK as the best-resourced and most active armed opposition group, with 2,400 members. The problem is that while the other opposition groups tend to cooperate with each other, they all have poor relations with the PJAK, which they accuse of having ambitions that go well beyond Iranian Kurdistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israeli sources say that some Kurdish groups have approached Jerusalem for support, and the PAK has let it be known that it is available to participate in an uprising. However, it is not clear whether Israeli direct engagement is feasible, nor whether the Americans would want to get drawn into an overt regime change operation. Moreover, the PAK has no sympathy for Reza Pahlavi. Other Kurdish groups have distanced themselves from the Israelis. All Kurdish groups have stated their support for demonstrations and popular revolts against the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also several Baluchi groups active against the Islamic Republic, but most of them seem to be more concerned with smuggling than with fighting. zThe one that appears to have significant military capabilities is the Islamist Jaysh al-Adl, whose members do not hide their connection to Israel. In 2019 the IRGC believed that the group had 900 fighters, but IRGC sources later acknowledged that this might be an underestimate. Moreover, the group appears to have been arming in recent months. There is no doubt that Jaysh al-Adl would be game for an offensive against the regime, but it is far from clear that it would be interested in cooperating with other opposition groups in undertaking such an effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another opposition group active in Iran is the Islamic State. Israel has recently admitted to supporting the terrorist group’s branch in Gaza, so perhaps supporting the Iranian one is not out of the question. The Islamic State, which in the past was able to carry out some terrorist attacks inside Iran, would however be of little use in any effort to foster regime change in Tehran, and few if any opposition groups would want to be caught cooperating with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;collapse-instead-of-revolution&quot;&gt;Collapse instead of revolution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before launching its strikes on the night of June 21-22, the U.S. government reportedly assured Iran that Washington’s aim was not regime change. However, the Netanyahu government’s main aim is clearly the downfall of the ayatollahs. On 18 June, Iranian state TV was jammed and an invitation to rise up against the regime was broadcast in place of regular programming. However, it will take more than that to fragment the pro-regime forces inside the country. While the physical and political damage Israel and the U.S. inflicted on Tehran was humiliating for the regime, the consequences may well take months to materialize. For now, there is no sign of the security forces losing their cohesiveness — contrary to the case in 2022-2023, when there were signs that certain elements were wavering. Back then, the army was suffering from large-scale desertions, and even the Basij — the paramilitary force controlled by the IRGC — demonstrated serious discipline issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By threatening in recent days to bombard Teheran even more extensively, the Israelis probably intended to create discontent in the medium term, as many families that fled to the countryside will not be able to stay away from their homes indefinitely. This could potentially lead to disturbances in the future. At the moment, demonstrating in the streets is a very risky proposition, as the security forces would have a very easy excuse to resort to extreme violence. Characteristically, various pro-Pahlavi groups have tried to mobilise people, but without success. In Teheran, the most they have managed to do is to shout from the windows of their flats, inviting others to pour into the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some within the opposition doubted the Israeli agenda all along. After all, Israeli media outlets like the Jerusalem Post openly tout the fragmentation of Iran into a Libya-like state. Some note that looking at the Israelis’ treatment of Gaza’s residents makes it hard to believe that they might have good intentions concerning Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could add that for all their stated good intentions, it is hard to fathom how the disparate opposition groups — ranging from old style Persian nationalists to ethnic separatists, from the far right to the far left, and from radical Islamists to militant secularists — could work together even if the regime were to come tumbling down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the ceasefire were to hold, criticism of the regime’s security policies of the last quarter century might come to the surface and, more importantly, a showdown between opposed factions within the regime might kick off. Still, while the opposition groups could create considerable disruption — and even contribute to bringing down the regime in the event that the Islamic Republic lost its cohesiveness — the eventual outcome is more likely to be a state collapse than a clean transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese leaders are deeply worried about threats to China’s economic security. For decades, China achieved breakneck economic growth that seemed to suggest the country was on an inexorable rise toward “national rejuvenation.” In recent years, however, China’s economic prospects have come under question, and Beijing has grown increasingly concerned about the nation’s economic security (经济安全).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central to these concerns are threats to the complex web of supply chains (供应链) that keep the Chinese economy humming. In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on global supply chains, prompting China to turn its attention to shoring up its economic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of the pandemic did not abate Beijing’s worries. The onset of the War in Ukraine in 2022, coupled with worsening U.S.-China relations and slowing domestic growth, convinced Chinese policymakers that they need to better fortify their economy against mounting threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/q95Xa7b.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Xi Jinping’s Mentions of “Supply Chains”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of the most important speeches of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s career—his report to the Communist Party’s 20th National Congress in 2022—he warned of “a new period of turbulence and change” in the world that threatens China’s quest for rejuvenation. In that speech, he demanded of his party comrades that they “must enhance our sense of crisis, adhere to bottom line thinking, be prepared for danger in times of peace, and be prepared to withstand major tests of high winds and even stormy waves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“[We] must enhance our sense of crisis, adhere to bottom line thinking, be prepared for danger in times of peace, and be prepared to withstand major tests of high winds and even stormy waves.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;--xi-jinping&quot;&gt;- Xi Jinping&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-China competition is front and center of Beijing’s concerns. Xi has repeatedly warned that the U.S.-led West is pursuing the “comprehensive containment, encirclement and suppression” of China. Tensions with the United States have intensified as the second Trump administration has applied unprecedented trade and economic pressure on China, and geopolitical hotspots like Taiwan and the South China Sea continue to simmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, how exactly does China define its economic security? A broad definition could encompass nearly anything. Policymakers in Beijing are no doubt worried about access to key technologies like semiconductors and artificial intelligence. China’s vulnerabilities in these areas have been the focus of much attention amid Washington’s measures to restrict the flow of those technologies into China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A close reading of Chinese officials’ speeches, authoritative policy documents, and academic studies suggests three areas are most fundamental to China’s ultimate economic security: food security, energy security, and financial security. Without stability in these core areas, Chinese society and its supply chains cannot properly function, and China cannot compete globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;why-these-three-pillars&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Why These Three Pillars?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The 14th Five Year Plan for 2021-2025, China’s most authoritative economic blueprint, included a first-of-its-kind section focusing on economic security. It laid out three strategies for shoring up China’s economic security across the three areas of food, energy, and finance—a clear indication that policymakers view these three areas as most crucial to China’s overall economic health and resilience.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how secure or vulnerable is China in each of these pillars of economic security?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This three-part ChinaPower series explores each of these areas in detail. The reports leverage data to analyze the most important vulnerabilities China faces, as well as key areas of strength and progress. Crucially, this series does not view China in isolation, but instead it grounds analysis of China’s situation in a comparative global context, especially in comparison to its chief competitor, the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-severe-are-chinas-food-security-challenges&quot;&gt;How Severe Are China’s Food Security Challenges?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FwN5m14.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01a&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food security is critical to the well-being and stability of all countries. Decades of economic growth have enabled considerable strides in increasing access to food across China, but this growth has also generated new demographic demands and environmental strains. Global shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic, war in Ukraine, U.S.-China tensions, and the effects of climate change have left Chinese policymakers anxious about China’s food security issues. This ChinaPower report lays out the most pressing threats to China’s food security as well as key areas of progress and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-to-chinas-food-security&quot;&gt;Challenges to China’s Food Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Chinese leaders, food security (粮食安全) is an “important foundation of national security.” Chinese leader Xi Jinping famously remarked that “solving the food problem for more than one billion people has always been the top priority of our party in governing the country.” Between 2013 and 2024, Xi mentioned food security in over 450 speeches, meetings, inspections, and other activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China faces three main interrelated challenges to its food security, each of which is analyzed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surging Food Consumption&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Constraints on Domestic Production&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reliance on Foreign Imports&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenge-1-surging-food-consumption&quot;&gt;Challenge 1: Surging Food Consumption&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s rapid economic growth has brought both enormous benefits and new challenges with respect to food security. On the upside, socioeconomic gains have fueled dramatic reductions in China’s undernourished population. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the rate of undernourishment in China’s population fell from 10.3 percent in 2001 to 2.5 percent (or less) by 2010. This decline coincided with a tripling of annual per capita disposable income from just 4,070 RMB to 12,520 RMB over the same period, according to Chinese government figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s increasingly well-off population has led to surging demand for food. In particular, the emergence of China’s urban middle class has corresponded with a shift away from a grain-oriented diet to a more expensive, meat-heavy intake. Today, China is the largest consumer of meat and fish in the world, consuming almost 168 million metric tons of meat and fish in 2023—more than a quarter of the world’s total. At almost 60 million metric tons consumed, pork was China’s top meat choice. The enormous demand for meat also directly translates to high demand for animal feeds, particularly soybeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/K5dT2oj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Meat and Fish Consumption in Selected Economies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More affluent urban residents have likewise developed an appetite for other resource-intensive foods, such as dairy products. In 2022 alone, China consumed 64 million metric tons of milk and imported 24 million metric tons, making it the largest milk importer in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing consumption has coincided with more food waste. China is the largest waster of food in the world, generating over 200 million metric tons of food waste in 2022. On a per capita basis, China is roughly on par with many other major economies. Chinese individuals wasted an average of 142 kilograms (kg) each in 2022, which is slightly less than the United States (159 kg per person), but considerably more than neighboring Japan (81 kg per person).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/flHSOFI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Estimated Annual Food Waste (2022)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given concerns about China’s food security, food waste has become a pressing policy issue. The Chinese government initiated multiple campaigns to reduce food waste, such as the Clean Plate campaign in 2013 and 2020. In 2021, China enacted the Anti-Food Waste Law to institutionalize monitoring and punishment mechanisms, particularly for the food service and retail sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To keep up with booming demand, Chinese leaders have published policies to promote domestic food production over imports.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Under the banner of an “all-encompassing approach to food” (大食物观), China’s 14th Five-Year Plan for 2021-2025 set specific targets to expand fishery production and the number of aquaculture farms and increase meat production.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In April 2025, China released the “Plan for Accelerating the Construction of an Agricultural Powerhouse (2024–2035).” It sets out foundational goals for securing China’s food production and supply, including strengthening food production capacity, conserving arable land, diversifying food sources domestically and abroad, advancing innovation and development of agricultural technology and machinery, and accelerating rural reforms.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2024, China’s State Council issued Opinions calling for diversification of China’s agricultural supply chains and modernized food resource management systems.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chinese farmers have experimented with some innovative methods to breed and raise more animals, including high-rise hog farms.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chinese food production policies have sometimes had unintended negative consequences. For example, to meet demand for milk, a 2018 Opinion launched a campaign that dramatically boosted milk production in China, but by 2024, production significantly outpaced consumption, and domestic milk prices plummeted.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenge-2-constraints-on-domestic-production&quot;&gt;Challenge 2: Constraints on Domestic Production&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has long sought self-sufficiency in food. In 1996, the Chinese government published a white paper on food security that called for achieving a self-sufficiency rate of 95 percent for grains. In 2019, China released another government white paper on food security, maintaining the 95 percent target and adding that China must have “absolute security” in staple grains (wheat and rice).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The rice bowls of the Chinese people must be firmly in our own hands. Our rice bowls should be filled mainly by Chinese crops.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;--xi-jinping-2021&quot;&gt;- Xi Jinping, 2021&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toward these ends, the Chinese government has identified domestic production as the “top priority.” China has achieved impressive gains in domestic production over the years and transformed itself into the largest food producer in the world. It produced 7.5 billion metric tons of food in 2022, nearly 3 billion metric tons more than the runner-up, India. China is also almost twice as efficient in wheat production per hectare as the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to FAO estimates, China—through domestic production and imports—is able to supply enough food to meet 139 percent of its population’s basic caloric needs. That is ahead of Japan (110 percent) and virtually the same as Europe (138 percent), but behind the United States, which, according to recent estimates, is able to meet 153 percent of its population’s needs through domestic production and imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AjAQmmy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Food Availability in Selected Countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite significant progress, Chinese leaders remain acutely aware that the country faces significant challenges to domestic production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the top constraints is the availability of arable farmland. Rapid industrial growth, sprawling urbanization, overcultivation, widespread pollution, and the growing impacts of climate change are significantly straining Chinese agriculture. According to the World Bank, China’s total arable land declined by over 12 million hectares between 2009 and 2021. By 2022, China had 31 percent less arable land than the United States, while having four times the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has sought to reverse the loss of arable land. In 2006, Chinese leaders established a “red line of 120 million hectares of arable land” in the11th Five-Year Plan. Xi reinforced this red line repeatedly in his speeches and guidelines, including “zero tolerance” and “lifetime responsibility” measures to punish officials who fail to maintain the designated red line of arable land in their jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/S3crglQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Arable Land&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sign of its domestic production challenges, some Chinese farmers have resorted to the overuse of fertilizers to try to help boost crop output. Between 2000 and 2015, China’s fertilizer usage per hectare of arable land increased by 67 percent. While fertilizers can increase output, they also exacerbated China’s arable land problems in the long run, contributing to low nutrient utilization, soil loss, pollution, and broader environmental damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the Chinese government began promoting “zero growth of fertilizer use” in major policy documents, including the 2016 and 2017 versions of the “Central Document No. 1,” and as a result, fertilizer use declined 17 percent by 2022. China nevertheless remains one of the world’s top consumers of fertilizer, with its usage rate at over three times that of the United States and the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/idHa8vO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Fertilizer Use in Selected Countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water security challenges exacerbate China’s food production issues. China has roughly the same amount of freshwater resources as the United States, but its population is more than four times larger, and it uses more than twice as much freshwater for agriculture. Adding to these challenges, decades of rapid urbanization and industrialization in eastern and southern China have significantly shifted the center of gravity of Chinese agricultural production toward the north and west, which are relatively water-scarce and suffer from higher degrees of water stress than the rest of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is supercharging these problems by causing more droughts, extreme heat, and floods. For example, a 2023 study found that extreme rainfall led to an 8 percent drop in Chinese rice yields over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has consistently called for arable land preservation and improvements to the quality of arable land through expanded monitoring and technical capacity.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the 2024 “Guiding Opinions on Strengthening the Protection of Cultivated Land, Improving the Quality of Cultivated Land, and Improving the Balance in Land Conversion and Restoration,” the Chinese government imposed “zero tolerance” and “life-time responsibility” measures to punish officials who fail to maintain the red line of arable land in their jurisdictions and implement conversion of cultivated land with centralized monitoring system.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s new 2024 National Food Security Law strengthened monitoring measures on the use of cultivated lands and imposed stricter control over the conversion of cultivated land into other land types.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) sets out targets for:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The protection of nutrient-rich black soil in China’s northeastern regions, which has faced serious soil erosion. The target is set to be about 9.3 million hectares of arable black soil.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A four percent increase in overall mechanization of agricultural production.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A more than five percent increase in the reuse of livestock and poultry manure.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A three million-acre increase in “high standard” farmlands, which are more resilient to disasters and soil degradation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Additional efforts in advancing agricultural sciences and developing resilient crops (see below sections for more).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In regard to water security:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Since 2002, China has invested in a multi-decade mega-infrastructure project, named the “South-North Water Diversion Project,” to transport southern water north and address water shortages in the northern and western provinces. The program has had mixed results.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Chinese State Council passed the 2021 Groundwater Management Law to protect groundwater quality and preserve groundwater availability. It published a 2023 Outline on constructing a “national water network” that connects rivers and lakes across the country to better manage water transfer and flood discharge capability.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In May 2024, China’s State Council passed a water conservation decree to require the government to promote and fund water-saving irrigation techniques, agricultural infrastructure, and research on drought-resistant crops.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To address the impacts of higher domestic food production costs on Chinese farmers:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has enacted anti-dumping policies, temporary storage policies, and minimum agricultural commodity procurement price policies. These trade barriers and stockpiling policies aim to prevent cheaper food imports from undercutting Chinese farmers while buffering shocks to Chinese food production.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued Opinions in January 2025 to conserve feed usage in animal husbandry industries, citing that 70 percent of animal husbandry production costs come from feeds.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has begun to engage in policies to address the issues of high land and labor costs. In February 2025, the State Council released a high-level Opinions document to promote structural reforms in China’s agricultural land transfer system and reduce the rental costs of land. The new policies also restrict rural land transfer to non-rural residents to keep arable land in the hands of farmers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beijing has also allowed genetically modified (GM) food products to enter the Chinese market.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) encourages GM-adjacent development in the agricultural and food sectors, paving the way for China to catch up in the adoption of GM organisms to reinforce food security.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2023, China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs approved GM corn and soybeans as well as GM seeds for commercial use. Another 17 GM crop variants were approved in December 2024. This is partly in reaction to China’s concerns over its seed availability and quality. It marked a profound change in Chinese policy, particularly given long-standing public antagonism against GM food products in China and elite opposition to the introduction of GM seeds.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenge-3-reliance-on-foreign-imports&quot;&gt;Challenge 3: Reliance on Foreign Imports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surging demand for food and constraints on domestic production have forced China to look abroad. China first became a net food importer in 2004, and in 2021, it surpassed the United States to become the world’s largest food importer. According to ChinaPower estimates, China imported a staggering $215 billion worth of food in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the country’s overall self-sufficiency for food declined from 94 percent in 2000 to 66 percent in 2020. Chinese experts have warned of a looming dip to 59 percent by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bQSIPWR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Food Trade Balance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s reliance on imports is not uniform across food products. In some areas, such as vegetables, China meets virtually all of its demand through domestic production. For other goods, China is heavily dependent on other countries. For instance, China relies on foreign suppliers (namely Brazil and the United States) for over 80 percent of its soybeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s sizable food imports leave it susceptible to volatility in global food prices. When international food prices spike, it can tighten the availability of those goods in China’s domestic market and contribute to food shortages and inflation at home. Researchers found that upward shocks in international food prices accounted for approximately 20 percent of fluctuations in China’s overall inflation between 1998 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WKL3slO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Food Import Dependence (2023)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global instability in food prices has at times posed significant political challenges for Beijing. In 2018, an outbreak of African swine fever spread from Europe to China, causing China to lose roughly 28 million metric tons of pork production over three years. This strained the supply of the most consumed meat in China and forced it to rapidly scale up imports at a high cost. Chinese officials became alarmed by the crisis, with some calling the issue a “national priority” and resorting to using frozen pork reserves and subsidies to stabilize local volatility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 also led to significant turbulence in global food trade. Many major food exporters, such as India, began to restrict food exports to stabilize their own domestic prices. China simultaneously faced declining grain imports and rising import prices. Available trade data indicates that China imported 10 percent less grain in 2022 but paid nine percent more compared to the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The supply shock from the Ukraine war accelerated China’s desire to diversify and reduce its food imports. Amid the war, Xi Jinping focused significant political attention on the issue. In 2022, the year Russia invaded Ukraine, Xi mentioned “food security” in at least 71 speeches, meetings, and other activities—double the year before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PvDpz6j.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Xi Jinping’s Mentions of “Food Security”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that China can extract some benefit from its large food trade deficit. China’s massive market creates economic leverage over food-exporting economies that depend heavily on Chinese consumers, such as the United States and Brazil. For instance, U.S. farmers have been more dependent on the Chinese market than China has been on U.S. imports. China has leveraged this advantage when it levied tariffs on U.S. agricultural imports into China in retaliation against U.S. tariffs in 2018 and 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Chinese central government has called for expanding domestic production of food in order to combat imported inflationary pressure:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A 2022 notice by the Chinese Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Affairs listed the expansion of soybean, oil crop, and corn plantations as the first key task.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To meet growing domestic meat demand, Xi Jinping has begun encouraging the agricultural sector to develop alternative protein sources since 2022, and the 14th Five-Year Plan on National Rural Technology Development specifically outlined alternative proteins as an important aspect of China’s food security.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beijing has also sought to reduce tariffs on China’s food imports by joining regional trade agreements like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in 2020 and signing bilateral trade deals with countries like Brazil. Joining RCEP, for example, removed tariffs on many of China’s major food import sources like Southeast Asia and Australia.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;However, China remains reluctant to remove protectionist policies that inflate domestic agricultural production costs. Beijing, for example, has ignored calls to remove minimum grain commodity price policies in favor of market reforms that allow the market to dictate grain prices. The Chinese government continued to implement minimum price policies to ensure stable levels of domestic cereal production and stockpiles.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-food-security-strengths&quot;&gt;China’s Food Security Strengths&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China faces considerable challenges to its food security, it has notable strengths in three key areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diversification of Food Imports&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High Levels of Food Access&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heavy Investment in Agricultural Innovation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strength-1-diversification-of-food-imports&quot;&gt;Strength 1: Diversification of Food Imports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given China’s growing food imports, reliable trade partners are crucial to its push for food security. Xi acknowledged the importance of food import diversification at a 2020 central rural work meeting. In his work report speech to the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 2022, he called for China to “build a diversified food supply system.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These exhortations come in the context of rising geopolitical tensions, particularly between the United States and China. The United States has long been one of China’s largest foreign food suppliers, but in recent decades, China has incrementally reduced its reliance on food from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6d1kwJC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Food Imports from the United States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process accelerated during the U.S.-China trade war that began in 2018 during President Donald Trump’s first term. In January 2020, Washington and Beijing put a pause on escalating the trade war by signing the Phase One trade agreement, which committed China to purchasing an additional $200 billion worth of U.S. products (compared to 2017 levels) in four sectors, including agriculture. U.S.-China trade in agriculture did rebound somewhat, but China failed to meet its Phase One purchase commitments. As of 2023, just 13 percent of China’s food imports came from the United States—down from almost 28 percent in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s declining reliance on U.S. soybeans and animal products drove much of the overall decline. In 2023, China bought 25 percent of its imported soybeans from the United States—down significantly from 49 percent in 2000. Over that same period, China reduced its reliance on the United States for meat and animal fat from 57 percent to just 13 percent. China has also seen declining reliance on U.S. dairy products, vegetables and fruits, seafood, and grains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wycH6ZZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Declining Reliance on Certain U.S. Foods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these trends are not universal. The United States remains a dominant supplier of some goods, such as animal feeds. It supplied 63 percent of China’s total feed imports in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil has been a major beneficiary of China’s food trade diversification—especially with respect to soybeans. In 2000, China bought about 20 percent of its soybeans from Brazil, but by 2023, that figure stood at 69 percent. That amounts to major business for Brazilian farmers. In 2023, China spent a staggering $41 billion on Brazilian soybeans. Following the U.S. tariffs in 2025, Brazil is likely to take up an even greater portion of China’s grain and meat imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0sgF8a5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Soybean Imports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond looking to Brazil, China has sought to leverage its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to enhance its food security. Between the launch of BRI in 2013 and June 2023, China signed over 100 agricultural and fishery agreements with 90 BRI countries. According to ChinaPower estimates, China imported about $82 billion worth of food from the BRI countries in 2023. A significant portion of these imports came from countries within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which provided nearly 17 percent of China’s total food imports in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China is diversifying away from the United States—especially in certain products like soybeans—overall diversification of food sourcing is occurring slowly. In 2023, BRI countries provided China with 39 percent of its food imports. That is only up slightly from 35 percent in 2013, when the initiative was started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NRUpWFp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Slow Diversification of China’s Food Import Suppliers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that diversification away from the United States does not address all of Beijing’s food security concerns. While China’s reduced reliance on the United States does mitigate some of the risk of disruptions due to geopolitical tensions, it still leaves China susceptible to other risks, such as natural disasters. In early 2025, for example, excessive rains slowed down Brazil’s soybean harvest. Worsening climate-driven extreme weather could exacerbate such phenomena and cause significant disruptions to China’s supply down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has been proactive in building agricultural relations around the world.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Since 2011, China has become the largest global funder of agricultural research and development (R&amp;amp;D) projects around the world. In 2023, China funded $1.8 billion in direct overseas investment in agricultural and related projects.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2024, China signed a memorandum of understanding on agricultural cooperation with the Arab League, promising deepened cooperation in crop planting, animal and plant disease prevention, animal husbandry, and agricultural trade. These engagements help bind the region closer to Beijing and may help China develop more diverse and reliable food supply chains in the future.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Besides soybeans, China has also moved from the United States to Brazil to supply other food products.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2022, China greenlit corn imports from Brazil, contributing to an immediate halving of U.S. corn imports from $5 billion in 2022 to $2.6 billion in 2023. As Brazilian corn rushed into Chinese markets, China’s corn imports from Brazil went from virtually nothing to $4 billion in the span of a year.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2024, China and Brazil signed a sorghum trade agreement to reduce their dependence on the United States, China’s then-largest sorghum supplier.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China is also actively building transportation infrastructure to further ensure a stable grain supply from Russia, Central Asia, and Europe. For instance, China and Russia signed an agreement in 2023 to construct a specialized railway grain terminal at the border to connect China with grain production centers across Eurasia. Historically, Russian and Chinese railroad gauges have had different widths, so grains going to China from the region needed to be transported by sea. The terminal, named the New Land Grain Corridor, helps resolve this issue and reduces transportation times by up to three months.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strength-2-high-levels-of-food-access&quot;&gt;Strength 2: High Levels of Food Access&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the availability of food—procured through domestic production and imports—another pillar of food security is “food access.” Food access refers to a population’s access to resources that allow them to meet their nutritional needs. This includes factors like wages, transportation, and proximity to grocery stores. China’s population enjoys a high level of food access, owing to food affordability, robust transportation networks, and large stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese consumers benefit from relatively affordable food in China. China’s per capita income has been rising faster than its food costs, as shown by the growing share of Chinese people who can afford a healthy diet despite increases in food costs. The growth and intense competition within China’s online and digitized supermarket industry have also increased the convenience and affordability of acquiring fresh food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PBYAMb0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Food Affordability in Selected Economies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s robust transportation infrastructure also helps connect food producers with consumers across the country. Like many countries, China’s food producers are concentrated in a handful of regions, and population centers in Eastern China are not self-sufficient in staple grain supply. A great deal of food needs to be transported across the nation. To meet these needs, China relies on its 159,000 km of railway and 128,000 km of domestic waterways (as of 2023), more than any other country besides the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also maintains large grain stockpiles, reportedly amounting to half of global grain reserves in 2022. This can be inferred from U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates, which show China holding massive ending stocks in grains (i.e., the volume of total grain supply subtracted by its consumption volume). For instance, China had nearly five times the level of corn ending stocks as the United States in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s intensive stockpiling policies provide some cushion against supply and demand shocks, especially in population centers. However, food storage facilities in China were often poorly designed, managed, and maintained in the 2010s, leading to loss and waste. These factors have contributed to the growing cost of stockpiling. According to the OECD, China spent $10 billion on public stockpiling in 2023, about 20 times what all OECD countries spent collectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZWR7byE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Grain Ending Stocks in Selected Countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2017, China published a new evaluation standard for mayor-level cadres based on performance in agricultural output, market access to food, food safety and quality monitoring, and food price control. Food market access, including the density of groceries, constitutes 20 percent of the total possible scores. A 2023 revision increased the scoring of grocery density by one point.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s 14th Five-Year Plan for E-Commerce Development includes targets to expand food access through e-commerce platforms and other new technologies. These include new digitally enhanced shopping experiences such as smart food pick-up lockers, unmanned grocery stores, and other web-based enhancements to community infrastructure and consumer experiences.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2022, the Chinese government published the “Guiding Opinions on Accelerating Scenario Innovation to Promote High-Level Applications of Artificial Intelligence for High-Quality Economic Development” to further promote business innovation in consumer experience technologies, including at groceries and food services, through leveraging AI technologies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In June 2024, China’s first National Food Security Law went into effect. It included mandates to establish central and local emergency food distribution and processing systems. The law also required enterprises that store central or provincial grain reserves to divest their commercial operations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;By October 2024, China reported that it had more than 5,100 emergency food storage enterprises, 6,900 emergency food processing enterprises, 3,900 emergency food distribution enterprises, and 59,000 emergency supply nodes. This builds on the growth of China’s wheat, rice, and corn reserves, which reached more than half of the world’s stocks in 2022.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strength-3-heavy-investment-in-agricultural-innovation&quot;&gt;Strength 3: Heavy Investment in Agricultural Innovation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given China’s constrained supply of arable land, its policymakers are leveraging agricultural technology innovation to increase the yield of crops. The 14th Five-Year Plan lays out specific targets for agricultural mechanization and scientific development. Similarly, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs published a 2025 policy plan that outlines key areas of agricultural innovation, including genetic modification of crops, agricultural robotics, and internet-based tools for farmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s agricultural modernization drive translates to a boom in ag-tech spending across the country. According to the OECD, China is the world’s top single spender on agricultural innovation, spending about $4.4 billion in 2023. Comparatively, the United States spent $3.8 billion, and the entire European Union spent $7.8 billion in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese businesses have consistently been the top investors in food and agricultural (agri-food) technology. According to Agfunder, Chinese corporations invested $6 billion in agri-food startups in 2021, and by 2023, China accounted for 41 percent of all agri-food start-up funding in the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BGmYgcd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Spending on Agricultural Innovation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One prominent area of modernization is crop seeds, a major preoccupation for Xi and China’s central leadership. To reduce import dependence for seeds and seed technology, Beijing has ramped up incentives for genetic engineering (which Chinese policymakers have historically avoided). Much of the investment goes toward seed-focused biotech companies like Hangzhou RFGene, whose genetically modified soybeans were recently approved for commercial use in China. These efforts have begun to bear fruit: Chinese state media proudly broadcasts China’s status as the top global producer of seed engineering patents, and 99.9 percent of seeds consumed in China are produced domestically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s farmers are also revolutionizing the use of agricultural drone technology. Chinese technology entrepreneurs have heralded the “low-altitude economy” (低空经济) as a key driver of domestic growth and an opportunity to seize global leadership. Agriculture is first on the list of industries benefiting from these technologies: one Chinese drone executive noted that China’s drones collectively spend 98 percent of flight time on agriculture-related functions. The growth of China’s agricultural drone industry has rattled policymakers in Washington, but expansion overseas has continued elsewhere at a rapid pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final locus of agricultural innovation is supply chain analytics. AI investment has poured into the industry, optimizing farm management, delivery networks, food safety monitoring, and strategic stockpile decision-making. One illustrative example is Pinduoduo, a Chinese e-commerce company that has invested billions of dollars in agri-food projects that leverage its e-commerce distribution platform and AI technology. Using cloud technologies, Pinduoduo developed a streamlined, centralized information system that manages dispersed supply chains, processes market information, and conducts sales and customer acquisition—seamlessly linking farmers and consumers from around the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs published the National Smart Agriculture Action Plan (2024-2028) to promote the establishment of a national data platform for agricultural information, including geospatial information, agricultural output and sales, and environmental data. The Action Plan also promotes the digitization of agricultural supply chains and singals the government’s commitment to supporting smart agricultural firms.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chinese scientists have been active in research to develop alternative protein sources. Simulations suggest that by 2035, it may be possible to replace 10 percent of meat production with plant-based meat and 15 percent of milk production with plant-based milk.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-robust-is-chinas-energy-security&quot;&gt;How Robust Is China’s Energy Security?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/trB6sXC.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01b&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy security is a crucial pillar of the economic and national security of every country. Disruptions that upset the steady supply of power can cause cascading ripple effects throughout industries and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s energy security is characterized by a mix of vulnerabilities and strengths. It is by far the world’s largest consumer of energy, placing enormous pressure on policymakers to fuel the nation’s sprawling manufacturing sector. China is also significantly reliant on foreign fossil fuels, leaving it exposed to disruptions stemming from instability and geopolitical competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet China has major energy security strengths. It is rapidly deploying renewable energy infrastructure to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. China also leads the world in producing critical minerals that are central to its energy security, and heavy investments in its energy grid are enabling China to prepare for a future powered by renewables. Finally, China’s abundant supply of coal offers policymakers a safety net in the event of major disruptions to other energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ChinaPower report explores these key strengths and vulnerabilities. It focuses not just on China’s absolute security needs but considers China’s situation in a global context—especially in comparison to the next-biggest energy consumer, the United States. Overall, China’s energy security position is relatively strong, and its advantages are poised to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vulnerabilities-in-chinas-energy-security&quot;&gt;Vulnerabilities in China’s Energy Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing is acutely aware of the importance of energy to China’s economic and national security situation. Between 2013 and 2024, Chinese leader Xi Jinping mentioned “energy security” (能源安全) in at least 180 different speeches, meetings, and other official activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/y2DUEz2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Xi Jinping’s Mentions of “Energy Security”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s focus on energy security surged in 2022 as the world grappled with disruptions to global energy flows following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. For Beijing, the conflict highlighted China’s need to pursue greater energy independence, with Xi repeatedly emphasizing that energy security “is one of the most important security issues” facing the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China faces two important energy challenges, each of which is examined below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Massive and Growing Demand for Energy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reliance on Foreign Oil and Gas&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-massive-and-growing-demand-for-energy&quot;&gt;1. Massive and Growing Demand for Energy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decades of rapid economic growth have dramatically increased China’s demand for energy. In 1980, around the start of China’s economic “reform and opening” period, China consumed less than one-fourth of the amount of energy of the United States. By 2008, China surpassed the United States to become the world’s largest energy consumer, and, in 2024, China consumed more energy than the United States, European Union (EU), and Japan combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/X6M1QfF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Energy Consumption of the World’s Top Economies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s unparalleled demand for energy is largely a factor of its globally dominant manufacturing sector. In 2022, Chinese manufacturers accounted for 57 percent of the country’s total energy consumption at approximately 90 exajoules (EJ), which is comparable to the total energy consumption of the United States and nearly 15 percent of global consumption that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Chinese households are accounting for a slowly rising share of total energy consumption as they become wealthier. Energy consumption in China’s residential sector has expanded from 10.5 percent of China’s total in 2012 to 13 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Pr2zMJj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image20&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Energy Consumption by Sector&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s energy consumption is slated to increase further in the coming years as new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) drive greater demand for electricity. Leading technology companies in the United States, China, and elsewhere are racing to set up energy-hungry data centers to power their AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese official estimates indicate that in 2025, data centers in China are expected to consume between 150 and 200 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is approximately 1.5-2 percent of the country’s total electricity consumption. That could more than double by 2030 to around 400 TWh, which is roughly equal to the entire electricity consumption of Saudi Arabia in 2023. More bullish estimates suggest an increase to around 530 TWh is possible by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China’s energy demand is growing, it will likely eventually plateau. Some studies suggest that this peak will not occur for another two decades, around 2049, but the exact timing will depend on several factors such as macroeconomic conditions and the speed of industrial adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improved energy efficiency explains part of the story. In 1990, China consumed twice as much energy as the United States to produce an equivalent amount of GDP. Since then, China’s energy intensity (as this measure is called) has plummeted dramatically, yet as of 2023, it was still 40 percent less efficient than the United States and about 50 percent less efficient than the EU and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wkhHO69.png&quot; alt=&quot;image21&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Energy Intensity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other long-term factors, like population decline, may also reduce energy demand. After peaking at over 1.42 billion people in 2021, recent forecasts project that China’s population will shrink by about 2 million people by 2030, and by 2050, it could fall another 130 million. While a shrinking population presents many economic and social challenges for China, Xi Jinping himself has pointed out that it could help to alleviate some issues like resource constraints and environmental damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;According to analyses by Chinese experts, China’s approach to meeting domestic energy needs has evolved through three main phases in recent decades:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Phase One focused on conservation, improving energy efficiency, and reducing environmental pollution. The 9th to 11th Five-Year Plans (spanning 1996-2010) emphasized energy conservation as the guiding principle of Chinese energy policies. The 11th Five-Year Plan specifically identified energy efficiency as the primary challenge in energy conservation efforts and outlined targets to enhance scientific and technological development in energy efficiency to meet national energy consumption.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Phase Two spanned the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015), which, for the first time, introduced the notion of “energy transition” (能源转型) from a coal-dependent energy structure to a greener, more diverse, and lower-carbon energy structure. It emphasized that deepening international energy cooperation and expanding international energy trade, particularly oil and gas, would be key to China’s energy transition efforts.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Phase Three, the current phase, continues to focus on energy transition but pivots to indigenous energy production as the primary focus in the face of rising geopolitical risks and heightened energy demands. The 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020), for the first time, introduced an energy self-reliance target of 80 percent and removed the mention of international trade from its text. It also introduced policy goals and institutional reform objectives to advance energy transition efforts that continued under the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025). The new plan also identified structural and regional imbalances in China’s energy system and geopolitical risks in oil and gas supply chains as key issues to resolve.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Furthering the third phase strategy, in 2023, the Central Commission for Comprehensive Deepening Reform (CCDR) reviewed and passed the “Opinions on Promoting Dual Control of Energy Consumption and Gradually Shifting to Dual Control of Carbon Emissions.” The Opinions signal a pivot of China’s decarbonization strategy from one focused on reducing energy consumption to one that emphasizes reducing carbon emissions. Following the Opinions, the State Council released a plan to incentivize provinces and municipalities to renew infrastructure and switch to less-polluting alternatives.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To meet China’s current and future data center energy demand, the Chinese government has proposed the plan of “East Data, West Compute” (EDWC, 东数西算). The plan aims to construct a network of eight computing hubs in western China and ten data clusters in eastern China. Western computing hubs can leverage their proximity to renewable power sources to compute data with lower access frequency, while also benefiting from cooler climates that reduce hardware cooling needs. Meanwhile, the eastern data clusters can focus on high-frequency data and offload more intensive computing to the west. According to the outlined goals in the 2023 Guideline on EDWC, the computing power of the new hubs would need to account for 60 percent of China’s total new computing power by the end of 2025.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Chinese government has published multiple action plans in recent years to construct green data center clusters and enhance the power usage effectiveness (PUE) of data centers through dedicated government monitoring and supervision. A 2024 action plan document sets out a plan to reduce the PUE of new large-scale data centers to 1.25 by 2025—an ambitious goal given China’s nationwide average PUE of 1.48 in 2023.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-dependence-on-foreign-oil-and-gas&quot;&gt;2. Dependence on Foreign Oil and Gas&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surging demand for energy has left China more reliant on foreign sources. Until the 1990s, China was a net energy exporter, but as of 2022, it imported about one-fifth of its total energy needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to some major economies, China is in a less precarious position. For instance, Japan’s limited endowment of natural resources and its island geography leave it reliant on imports for almost all its energy (87 percent in 2023), and the EU imports about two-thirds of its energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1B31edM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image22&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Energy Import Dependence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s biggest energy imports are foreign oil and gas. China is the world’s largest crude oil importer by a wide margin, accounting for about 25 percent of global imports. It is also the largest natural gas importer. In all, China imported 74 percent of its oil and 42 percent of its natural gas supply in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stands in stark contrast to the United States’ energy position. In 2018, the United States surpassed Saudi Arabia to become the world’s top crude oil producer, and in 2019, it became a net energy exporter for the first time since the 1950s. U.S. strengths in fossil fuels were primarily driven by the shale revolution, in which advancements in hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” and horizontal drilling unlocked vast reserves of oil and natural gas, and the expansion of liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure enabled U.S. suppliers to scale up global exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite recent efforts, China faces challenges in replicating U.S. successes. While China is estimated to have the largest shale gas reserves in the world—almost twice that of the United States—its reserves are deeper, more geographically scattered, and located in more mountainous areas, making extraction more challenging. As of 2020, China was home to just 1.5 percent of the world’s technically recoverable oil and 4.5 percent of global natural gas reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QfWTlFy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Oil &amp;amp; Gas Independence: The U.S. vs China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy independence and diversification have taken on new urgency for many countries amid worsening geopolitical tensions. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the EU has sought to reduce its dependence on Russian energy and deny Moscow income to support the war. So far, the results have been mixed. At the end of 2024, the EU only imported 2 percent of its oil from Russia—down from 18 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022. However, EU reliance on Russian LNG imports increased from 11 percent to 22 percent over the same period, even as pipeline natural gas (PNG) imports have fallen dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has moved in the opposite direction as part of Beijing’s broader strengthening of ties with Moscow since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Between 2021 and 2024, the share of Chinese crude oil imports coming from Russia increased from less than 16 percent to nearly 20 percent. Over the same period, the share of China’s PNG imports coming from Russia nearly tripled from 13 percent to 38 percent, largely owing to the ramp-up of Russian production along the Power of Siberia 1 pipeline. Russia’s share of China’s LNG imports also climbed from 6 percent to 11 percent during this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9jy1l1k.png&quot; alt=&quot;image24&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Chinese Imports of Key Russian Energy Products&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China-Russia energy ties could strengthen further in the coming years. Russia is negotiating with China for a new natural gas pipeline named Power of Siberia 2, which would carry gas from Russia’s Yamal peninsula in West Siberia through Mongolia into northern China. Moscow reportedly sought to begin construction of the pipeline in 2024, with the goal of starting gas deliveries in 2030; however, China appears to be waiting to secure a more favorable price for the gas before moving forward. China has been involved with other Russian natural gas projects, including the Arctic LNG 2 plant, which provides further avenues for strengthening energy ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying energy from Russia offers important benefits for Beijing. Chinese purchases have been a crucial economic lifeline for Russia amid its war in Ukraine, binding Moscow closer to Beijing. Russia’s proximity to China also reduces the likelihood that physical energy deliveries will be cut off, which enhances China’s overall energy security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uQ0XdPC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image25&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Foreign Crude Oil Suppliers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet buying from Russia does not solve all of China’s import dependency challenges. China’s reliance on other countries for oil and gas leaves it exposed to disruptions. More than half of China’s crude oil comes from the Middle East, where conflicts and instability have long caused disruptions and price fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, almost all the oil China imports from countries besides Russia (about 80 percent of its crude oil imports) travels by sea through the Malacca Strait, a strategically important maritime chokepoint connecting the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Likewise, nearly one-third of China’s total goods imports transit through the Taiwan Strait, which in 2022 included some $500 billion worth of crude oil, refined oil, and other mineral and metal products. Conflicts over Taiwan or the South China Sea could seriously jeopardize China’s continued access to energy flowing through these key trade routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To expand petroleum production capacity, China has actively searched for new oil reserves, with significant success. The 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) outlines goals to expand oil and gas exploration within China, reiterating Xi’s calls to expand domestic oil production in 2018.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Since then, the country has made numerous discoveries, including multiple hundred-million-ton oil reserve sites in regions such as Henan, Shandong, and the South China Sea. However, the actual technically extractable quantity may remain quite low due to the complex underground geography at many of these newly discovered sites, and drillers’ price margins have been tested by geopolitical turbulence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China is also actively expanding its strategic oil reserves. The government instructed state-owned oil corporations to add nearly 60 million barrels of crude oil to China’s strategic reserve in July 2024 and called for accelerating annual stockpiling of strategic fuels, including oil, in March 2025.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To mitigate geopolitical risks and circumvent chokepoints such as the Strait of Malacca and the Gulf of Aden, China is constructing rail and pipeline networks that connect China with oil and gas supplies from the broader Eurasian and Middle Eastern regions. In the southwest, China has constructed oil and gas pipelines through Myanmar, which have been operational. However, the civil war in Myanmar has caused disruptions and concerns from China over the security of the pipelines.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strengths-in-chinas-energy-security&quot;&gt;Strengths in China’s Energy Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite notable challenges China faces in energy security, it is in an increasingly strong position to overcome surging demand, environmental costs, import reliance, and energy infrastructure. China has four interrelated strengths to secure energy for its population and the economy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technological Leadership in Renewable Energy Technologies&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leading Player in Critical Mineral Production&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rapid Progress Toward Grid Modernization&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deep Reserves of Coal as a Fallback&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-technological-leadership-in-renewable-energy-sources&quot;&gt;1. Technological Leadership in Renewable Energy Sources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s leaders have set their sights on reducing the country’s reliance on fossil fuels, and they view renewable energy as key to China’s long-term energy security, economic growth, and carbon emissions goals. They are investing accordingly to position China as a global leader in renewable energy technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is deploying renewables at a rapid pace, with solar and wind leading the way. In 2024, China installed 278 gigawatts of solar capacity—adding more in a single year than the entire solar capacity already installed in the United States at that time. China’s installed capacity in wind likewise increased nearly 18 percent in 2024, three four faster than Europe and nearly six times faster than the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RJQYhMY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image26&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China Is Rapidly Deploying Wind and Solar Energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s impressive gains in renewables are buoyed by unparalleled investments, as its state-backed banks and investment firms pour financing into green energy projects. According to estimates from BloombergNEF, China’s investments in clean energy reached $818 billion in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like China, the United States is also investing heavily in renewable energy sources. Its 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) sought to stimulate renewable energy investments through grants, loans, and tax credits totaling approximately $370 billion. These projects have catalyzed growth in the U.S. renewable energy sector, but despite these gains, U.S. spending continues to lag behind China’s. In 2024, U.S. investments in clean energy only reached $338 billion, less than half of China’s level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Bn1T2S1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image27&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China Leads in Clean Energy Investment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s lead in clean energies is poised to widen thanks to high-level policy support. Beijing views clean energy and related technologies as critical to not just energy security and decarbonization but to economic growth as well. In an April 2025 speech, Xi noted that “the green transition… is a new engine for economic and social development.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, since at least 2023, Chinese economic planners have referred to the “new three” (新三样)—photovoltaic cells, lithium batteries, and electric vehicles—as a source of economic vitality. Chinese manufacturers have grown to dominate the global supply of these three key green technologies and other renewables like wind and hydroelectric components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Q7GBWjD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image28&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China Leads Global Manufacturing of Green Technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would-be competitors in the United States, the European Union, and emerging markets remain heavily reliant on Chinese suppliers for upstream manufacturing inputs into clean energy projects. As economic competition with China has intensified, U.S. policymakers have moved to reduce U.S. dependence on China for future decarbonization efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond just renewables, China is looking to a broader suite of non-fossil fuels to power China’s economy. The 14th Five-Year Plan for Renewable Energy Development, released in 2022, calls for a “clean, low-carbon, secure, and highly efficient” energy system, and stipulates that non-fossil fuel electricity generation should contribute “about 39 percent” of total electricity generation by 2025. China is on track to reach this target. By 2024, hydro, solar, wind, nuclear, and biofuels collectively powered over 38 percent of China’s total electricity production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/I07bbQ0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image29&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Share of China’s Electricity Production Coming from Non-Fossil Fuels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear power is an increasingly important part of these efforts. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, China has built over 55 gigawatts of installed nuclear electricity generation capacity, putting it third behind the United States (97 GW) and France (63 GW). China has an additional 30 GW of nuclear power capacity under construction, which, once completed, would place China ahead of France. According to some estimates, nuclear power could contribute to around 10 percent of China’s total electricity generation by 2035—up from just 4.5 percent in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In September 2020, Xi Jinping pledged to accelerate policies that would enable China to reach peak carbon emissions before 2030 and net-zero emissions before 2060. These targets, referred to as China’s “dual-carbon goal” (双碳目标), provide the impetus for China’s green transition efforts. More policy efforts included:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s 14th Five-Year Plan calls for an 18 percent reduction in CO2 emissions per unit of GDP by 2025 along with a host of related targets. These targets were enumerated in the March 2022 “14th Five-Year Plan for a Modern Energy System,” which calls for non-fossil fuel power sources to provide about 39 percent of power generation by 2025. “Energy security” features prominently in this document.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Another key policy supporting China’s renewable energy sector is a high-level State Council Opinions document published in 2021, which calls for 25 percent of power generation to come from non-fossil fuel methods by 2030. This document is supplemented by a series of departmental action plans and more granular policies, which together compose what is referred to as the “1+N” framework.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s National People’s Congress (NPC) drafted a new Ecological and Environmental Code that revises, merges, and retires 10 existing environmental and anti-pollution laws and establishes a legal framework to mandate the government to enforce, track, and expand China’s green energy transition efforts in industries and through global cooperation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Subsidies, tax incentives, and other forms of government support played a key role in the rise of China’s green technology sector during the 2010s. These subsidies have mostly ended, but other forms of support (like below-market credit) remain.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Owing to these subsidies, China’s energy sector hit its target for renewable energy adoption—1200 GW of solar and wind capacity by 2030—six years ahead of schedule.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite China’s rapidly growing renewable power supply, it remains heavily reliant on coal, a position which Xi Jinping has endorsed in the near term. Xi described this strategy as “first build, then destroy” (先立后破), referring to building a robust renewable system before coal-based methods are abandoned. This approach informed the subsequent National Development Reform and Commission (NDRC) 2024 Guiding Opinions document, which outlined measures to improve renewable energy utilization.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-leading-player-in-critical-mineral-production&quot;&gt;2. Leading Player in Critical Mineral Production&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s leadership in many new energy technologies is underpinned by the country’s dominance in critical mineral supply chains. Decades of intensive industrial policy, comparatively lax environmental regulations, and massive economies of scale enabled China to position itself as the leading refiner and processor of many critical minerals that are indispensable to the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China plays a significant role in both the upstream and downstream portions of many critical minerals. Upstream, China is a leading provider of many ores—the raw deposits containing minerals that can be extracted and processed into more pure products for downstream use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s dominance in downstream refining and processing is even more pronounced. As an instructive example, in 2024, China produced 21 percent of the world’s bauxite—the main ingredient used to produce aluminum—but produced almost 60 percent of the world’s refined aluminum. This has further spillover effects, since processing bauxite into aluminum can generate gallium as a byproduct. That is how China came to produce 98 percent of the world’s gallium, which is used in many energy technologies, including solar cells, electric vehicles, and fast-charging devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cL7sEV9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image30&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China Dominates Critical Minerals Important to Energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond these, China refines nearly half of the world’s steel, zinc, and lead, as well as more than two-thirds of the world’s cobalt and lithium. Furthermore, in 2023, China refined 79 percent of the world’s battery-grade graphite and 92 percent of the rare earth elements used to produce permanent magnets, which are integral to wind turbines, electric motors, and many other technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s key role in critical mineral supply chains confers advantages to its clean energy sector. For instance, an abundance of refined critical minerals makes China’s energy transition more cost-effective and scalable, as the country’s metallurgy industry can provide reliable supplies of critical components to downstream green technology manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2023, China’s State Council issued an Opinion on improving mine operation safety as the government sought to expand mineral extractions in China.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has expanded lithium exploration since 2021, boosting its global share of lithium reserves from 6 to 16.5 percent. China’s domestic lithium production is growing steadily, though the poor quality of much of its reserves poses a challenge to the price competitiveness of its refining operations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China recently discovered a major uranium deposit in the Ordos Basin in its northwestern region, as well as a major thorium reserve in Inner Mongolia. These two discoveries could help fuel China’s expansion in nuclear power and substantially reduce China’s reliance on uranium imports, especially from the United States and Russia.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-rapid-progress-toward-grid-modernization&quot;&gt;3. Rapid Progress Toward Grid Modernization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to energy, production only tells part of the story. For power to be useful, it must be delivered reliably and affordably to end users. This is the task facing China’s rapidly growing electrical grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of China’s energy demands are concentrated in its densely urbanized east coast. This poses a challenge for China’s green transition goals, since its most quickly growing sources of renewable energy—solar and wind power—require large tracts of land. China’s newer renewable energy facilities are concentrated in western inland provinces, where land is more plentiful, but they suffer from wasted power and low rates of utilization. In the western region of Tibet, for instance, 27.5 percent of wind power and 32.2 percent of solar power went to waste in January and February 2025, far higher than the national averages of 6.2 percent and 6.1 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ISMGwSu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image31&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Net Energy Balance by Province (2022)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s grid operators have sought to remedy this through massive grid infrastructure spending and redesigned grid architecture. A cornerstone of this effort is China’s ultra-high-voltage (UHV) grid network, which can deliver electricity over long distances and thereby alleviate supply-demand disconnects by transmitting energy produced in the west to consumers in the east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s global leadership in UHV infrastructure is decades in the making. Planning for this network began as early as 2006, during China’s 11th Five-Year Plan. The newest UHV grid commenced construction in 2024 with a total investment of about RMB 35.3 billion ($4.8 billion). This will add to the 42 UHV projects already completed, but more work remains to achieve Beijing’s goal of country-wide grid integration and power market unification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s efforts to upgrade its grid infrastructure are complemented by steps toward energy market liberalization. Prior waves of renewable energy investment benefited from price control policies that disincentivized coal-based production, but these measures were blamed for precipitating energy shortage crises in 2021 when it became unprofitable for coal-based producers to operate in certain parts of the country. The aftermath of this debacle accelerated calls for a unified, market-based pricing structure. Chinese regulators responded by launching significant market-oriented reforms in February 2025, which analysts predict will drive smarter battery investments and grid resource allocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though China’s grid upgrading remains a work in progress, its efforts are outpacing those of the United States. Experts have called for investment in UHV infrastructure in the United States, but to date, no projects have been completed. U.S. grid designers face permitting and financing hurdles that dampen the appetite for UHV investments. One study cited a 17-year regulatory timeline before construction could begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States still leads China in some metrics of grid performance, such as frequency and duration of power outage events—a common metric for grid reliability. However, China has made rapid strides in recent years and is steadily closing the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7F0iKhw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image32&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China Is Catching Up to the United States in Electric Grid Reliability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chinese policymakers are seeking to unify the country’s regional power grids into one unified grid that functions as a single integrated market. An NDRC Guiding Opinions document issued in 2022 outlines the steps of this process.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Market reforms are also key to China’s grid upgrading efforts:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In February 2025, the NDRC announced a set of reforms that will eliminate feed-in tariffs for renewable energy, which have been in place for wind and solar power since 2009 and 2011, respectively. While active, these tariffs incentivized renewable energy projects by guaranteeing a higher rate of return for electricity sold.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The new system will implement market-oriented pricing reforms, which may result in tighter balance sheets for future renewable energy projects, but is ultimately expected to raise the uptake of renewable-generated power.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;All of these reforms depend on modern, efficient infrastructure, and China’s grid operators are rushing to keep pace. China’s largest grid operator, State Grid, announced plans to invest $88.7 billion into its grid infrastructure in 2025, following on from its spending of $70 billion in 2024 and similar investments in prior years.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-deep-reserves-of-coal-as-a-fallback&quot;&gt;4. Deep Reserves of Coal as a Fallback&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite China’s efforts to transition to renewables and other non-fossil fuel sources, coal continues to play a leading role in its energy system. Coal supplied 56 percent of China’s primary energy in 2024, dramatically higher than the United States (8 percent). In fact, since 2011, China has consumed more coal than the rest of the world combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is far more self-reliant in coal than in other fossil fuels, like oil and gas. It boasts about 13.3 percent of the world’s technically recoverable coal reserves, and it is by far the largest coal producer in the world. China does import some coal—mostly from Russia, Australia, Mongolia, and Indonesia—but the amount of imported coal accounts for only about 6.6 percent of China’s total energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0Sg3EHR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image33&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Global Coal Consumption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal has become especially important in the wake of recent energy crises. Record-high coal prices due to coal shortages and state-enacted electricity price controls culminated in a severe electricity supply crisis in China in late 2021, impacting 20 provinces and leading to prolonged outages in some regions. In summer 2022, record temperatures and drought in the Yangtze River reduced the supply of hydroelectric power amid peak power demand, leading to power disruptions in southern provinces like Sichuan, which relies on hydropower for 80 percent of its electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following these crises, China doubled down on coal as a backup energy source, and it is rapidly expanding its coal-fired power capacity. As of April 2025, at least 311 coal-fired power plants were under construction in China with 204 gigawatts of combined capacity—nearly four times the combined level of coal-fired capacity under construction in the rest of the world. Just one Chinese province, Inner Mongolia, has more coal-fired power capacity than all but two countries (the United States and India) in the world in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hGWuIMm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image34&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Global Coal-Fired Power Capacity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burning coal may be China’s most dependable path to ultimate energy security, but it comes at a price. According to Carbon Atlas, 72 percent of China’s CO2 emissions came from coal in 2023, compared to 66.4 percent in India and 15.8 percent in the United States. Increased coal reliance may jeopardize China’s carbon emissions goals for 2030 and 2060, or at a minimum, make the deferred transition more costly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large emissions also translate into health costs. In 2021, household air pollution from burning solid fuels like coal and wood was attributed to an estimated 29.2 deaths per 100,000 people in China—over 415,000 people altogether, compared to about 16 people in total in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, coal-fired power generation adds to China’s water burden. China is one of the world’s most water-stressed countries, and coal plants consume large volumes of freshwater for cooling facilities, cleaning coal, and powering turbines in the form of steam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water-scarce northern and western regions, which often have a higher density of coal plants, face trade-offs in distributing water between energy and agricultural industries, the latter of which consumes a large portion of the country’s water. Chinese policymakers have pushed for the adoption of air-cooling technologies in coal plants since 2012, an effort that has reduced water consumption in energy generation but could negatively impact thermal efficiency and emission rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the environmental and health costs, it is unlikely that China will back away from coal in the near term. China’s growing power needs will strain China’s power supply and impact industrial growth if demand is not met. For now, the government’s continued insistence on long-term coal contracts incentivizes many electricity buyers to choose coal over renewables. Some provinces are also particularly reliant on the coal industry for tax revenue and employment, making it politically challenging for local governments to rapidly shift toward renewables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chinese leaders, particularly under Xi, have paid close attention to environmental and air pollution problems. However, issues like misaligned promotion and tenure incentives and inefficient implementation strategies have created obstacles for the Chinese government to tackle environmental challenges, particularly in poorer regions and areas reliant on coal and heavy industries.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s coal-based power generation strategy is somewhat at odds with its emissions goals, but rather than abandoning new coal-fired projects, it is seeking to make them marginally cleaner.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A 2025 guideline released by China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) stated that China will continue to construct coal-fired power plants through 2027 to stabilize the power grid or back up peak demand.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The 2025 guideline adopted a previous 2024 guideline on adopting and converting coal-fired power capacity with lower carbon emission rates.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s current energy security situation is a mixed bag. On one hand, the country faces substantial near-term challenges. Beijing’s push to dominate global manufacturing is consuming an eye-watering amount of the world’s energy, and China’s limited domestic energy reserves have left it reliant on vulnerable foreign energy supplies to a level that is concerning for Chinese leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, China has marshaled a formidable set of strengths. Its dominance in renewable energy technologies and critical minerals, as well as its rapid grid modernization, puts it at the forefront of global efforts to transition to the energies of the future. Meanwhile, in the event of a crisis, China can lean on coal as a stopgap, although doing so comes at political and environmental costs. Ultimately, China’s energy security hinges on its ability to balance competing priorities. How Beijing navigates this path will have not only domestic consequences but also global implications for energy markets, climate action, and geopolitical competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-financial-risks-threaten-chinas-economic-security&quot;&gt;How Do Financial Risks Threaten China’s Economic Security?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oHA1LtO.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01c&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese leader Xi Jinping has called for China to become a “financial superpower” (金融强国) rivaling established leaders like the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan. Yet, mounting geopolitical tensions and slowing economic growth at home have sparked concerns in Beijing about the country’s overall “financial security” (金融安全). China has made notable strides in recent years to shore up financial risks, but numerous challenges persist. This ChinaPower feature explores four key vulnerabilities and three strengths in China’s financial security. Taken together, they paint a cloudy picture of Beijing’s long-term prospects of becoming a global financial leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vulnerabilities-in-chinas-financial-security&quot;&gt;Vulnerabilities in China’s Financial Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China faces four important vulnerabilities to its financial security, each of which is outlined and analyzed below. These vulnerabilities are closely inter-related: strain in one area can exacerbate problems in another area. These are not the only vulnerabilities facing China’s financial system, but they encompass the most pressing risks in the eyes of regulators and investors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vulnerability-1-exposure-to-foreign-sanctions&quot;&gt;Vulnerability 1: Exposure to Foreign Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s threat perceptions with respect to financial security have shifted as China’s domestic and international conditions have changed. One of the clearest indications of this is the political messaging coming from Xi Jinping himself. Analysis of an official database cataloging Xi’s “important speeches” offers revealing insights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bMgKMjO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image35a&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Number of Reports on Financial Security (in Purple)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi has consistently stressed the issue of financial security during his tenure. Between 2013 and 2024, the phrase financial security appeared in at least 44 state media reports of his speeches, meetings, and other activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hNtixpH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image35b&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Number of Reports on Financial Risks (in Red)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addressing China’s financial security, he has frequently stressed mitigating financial risks that could jeopardize China’s economic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the types of risk facing China are evolving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dlxJyCh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image35c&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Number of Reports on Financial Crisis (in Green)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, China’s attention has centered on building resilience to financial crises, like the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. However, Xi’s mentions of financial crisis have declined markedly with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat of financial crises has not gone away, but Beijing now also perceives new, worrying threats from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Z7s9QTT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image35d&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Number of Reports on Sanctions (in Blue)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Xi has more frequently warned of the threat of weaponized foreign sanctions amid increasing economic and technological competition with the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s mentions of sanctions surged in 2022 as the West imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Beijing worries it could be targeted next, and it is buttressing its economy in preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s worries over sanctions initially spiked during the first Trump administration, when Washington imposed sanctions on Chinese companies, including technology giants Huawei and ZTE. The Biden administration escalated efforts to sanction Chinese companies and targeted China with a suite of export controls on advanced technologies, especially semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such targeted U.S. sanctions are a significant concern for China, but they do not pose a systemic risk to China’s economic and financial security. However, more sweeping financial sanctions—such as those imposed on Russia by the United States and its allies since 2022—could cause much greater pain for China’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Washington and its allies imposed sweeping sanctions targeting major Russian banks, state-owned firms, and key individuals, including President Putin and oligarchs. These measures included freezing hundreds of billions of dollars in Russian central bank foreign reserves, removing Russian banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) international payment system, and restricting exports of critical technologies to weaken Russia’s military and economic capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imposing similar measures on China could inflict enormous pain on its economy. By cutting off access to dollars and dollar-based institutions, Chinese experts are worried that U.S.-led sanctions could jeopardize three major functions in China’s financial system: trade settlement, investment financing, and monetary policy operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. sanctions could disrupt China’s trade flows by blocking cross-border payments. In 2024, China conducted $6 trillion of trade in goods with the rest of the world, roughly 71 percent of which was denominated in dollars and other foreign currencies. These transactions are facilitated by a series of dollar-based international institutions, most notably SWIFT, the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS), and various intermediary banks financing the trade process. Sanctions that bar access to these institutions would significantly curtail the ability of Chinese importers and exporters to settle payments for goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, some of China’s trading partners would likely attempt to utilize alternative payment infrastructure. Yet many of China’s high-value imports are manufactured exclusively by companies in the United States or allied regions and thus would be particularly difficult for China to replace. Sanctions would likely also block China’s exporters from reaching key overseas markets, undercutting their bottom lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CAPlkrT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image36&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Share of China’s Trade Denominated in RMB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-led financial restrictions could also constrain China’s ability to raise capital and finance industry growth. China’s dollar-denominated debt owed to foreign lenders totaled just over $1 trillion as of June 2024, and it continues to raise funds through bond sales overseas. Chinese companies likewise raise money in foreign equity markets. Chinese firms listed on U.S. stock exchanges held a market capitalization of $1.1 trillion as of March 2025, and many more receive dollar-based venture capital funding and other forms of direct investment. U.S.-led sanctions could sever access to these avenues for raising capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, U.S.-led sanctions could destabilize Beijing’s monetary policy priorities. Massive reserves of U.S. dollars are essential to the ability of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to achieve its primary mandate to “maintain the stability of the value of the currency and thereby promote economic growth.” The exact value of dollar-based assets held by the PBOC is subject to debate, but a rough estimate suggests a ballpark figure of $1.6 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Washington and its allies sought to exert pressure on Beijing, they could coordinate to freeze China’s dollar reserve assets held within their borders. This would quickly cause a shortage of dollars in China, leading to a drop in the value of the RMB, a shock in import prices, and challenges in meeting debt repayment obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We should … oppose interference in internal affairs, oppose unilateral sanctions and “long-arm jurisdiction”, and jointly create a peaceful and stable development environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;--xi-jinping-2020-brics-leaders-summit&quot;&gt;- Xi Jinping, 2020 BRICS Leaders’ Summit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns about these threats have galvanized Beijing to accelerate efforts toward sanctions resilience. China has sharply criticized U.S. sanctions against China and Russia, describing them as acts of U.S. “long-arm jurisdiction” (长臂管辖). Beijing responded to initial U.S. sanctions by passing an Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law in 2021, which set up a legal framework for China to retaliate against sanctions. This framework was expanded in March 2024 to include a broader array of retaliatory measures, an indicator that Beijing is bracing for deepening geopolitical conflict with its international rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, Chinese leaders are striving to develop alternative financial infrastructure to reduce reliance on Western-dominated systems, and they view RMB internationalization as a cornerstone of strengthening China’s geopolitical position vis-à-vis the United States. However, despite notable progress, China’s financial system continues to rely heavily on U.S. dollars and thereby remains vulnerable to the threat of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2021, China passed the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, building upon the pre-existing Foreign Trade Law and other legislation outlining safeguards and retaliatory measures against sanctions attempts. This was updated and expanded in March 2024.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has sought to reduce reliance on dollar-based payment infrastructure by establishing alternatives like the Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), which has grown to include 168 direct participants and 1461 indirect participants spread across every major geographic region.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has also been expanding its network of currency swap agreements, which are designed to improve RMB liquidity to partner economies experiencing financial crises. These efforts include agreements with 42 central banks or monetary authorities to date (discussed more below).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s policymakers have discreetly shifted China’s some of central bank reserves to state-owned banks and simultaneously downsized its U.S. Treasury holdings, both of which have the effect of obscuring Beijing’s monetary policy maneuvering.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vulnerability-2-high-debt&quot;&gt;Vulnerability 2: High Debt&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rising debt levels are another key threat to China’s financial security. China’s economy is permeated by highly indebted firms, which is a drag on overall economic performance and jeopardizes Beijing’s “bottom line of no systemic financial risks” (不发生系统性金融风险的底线). China’s high debt levels also weaken its international competitiveness by dissuading risk-averse investors from entering Chinese markets, thereby undermining Beijing’s stated goal of global financial integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s financial regulators often discuss these concerns in terms of improving China’s “macro leverage ratio” (i.e. its debt-to-GDP ratio), which the 14th Five-Year Plan highlighted as a key dimension of financial security. China’s non-financial debt reached 292 percent of GDP in 2024, which is considerably higher than most other major economies, including the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cFYRHCQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image37&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Rising Debt-to-GDP Ratio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On paper, this debt is typically divided into central government debt, local government debt, household debt, and debt from private non-financial firms. In practice, however, these debt burdens are closely linked. Local governments that lent to questionable real estate and infrastructure projects are struggling to recoup their investments amid China’s ongoing real estate sector slowdown, and a growing number of local government-related investment products have defaulted or been flagged with warnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Household debt is also exposed to turbulence in the real estate market, not least because 60 percent of household debt is in the form of residential mortgages. Taken together, this brittle network of non-performing debt creates risks of financial contagion and cascading crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s debt-related vulnerabilities are complicated by its exposure to geopolitical risk. Increased tariffs levied by President Trump in March 2025 will strain Chinese manufacturers operating on thin margins and likely push some into default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overseas trade in Chinese bonds is similarly exposed. The total size of China’s offshore bond market is estimated to sit at roughly $780 billion, which supplements the $579 billion worth of foreign holdings of onshore Chinese bonds. This market has historically served as a supplemental source of fundraising for local governments, one that would be cut off if U.S. investors were forced to dump Chinese assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, Beijing’s ability to address China’s debt is constrained by U.S. monetary policy. Under normal circumstances, Chinese policymakers could ease the burden of indebted firms by reducing the PBOC’s benchmark interest rates and thereby lowering the cost of firms’ interest payments. This is more difficult, however, when the U.S. Federal Reserve maintains high U.S. benchmark rates—as it did from 2022 to 2024—because lower PBOC rates prompt global investors to withdraw investments from Chinese markets and chase higher returns in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This threat of capital flight is illustrated in part by the widening gap in returns on U.S. versus Chinese 10-year government bonds. Now that the Fed has lowered rates, Beijing has gained more room for maneuverability to cut its own rates, but this trend could reverse if inflationary pressure returns to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Diverging Interest Rates Prompt Capital Flight from China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s efforts to reduce debt—often referred to as a deleveraging campaign—was formally launched in 2016 and remains in full swing. It has used an assortment of tools to address unsustainable debt:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beijing has launched several rounds of stimulus to curb debt growth and help firms clean up their balance sheets. One recent package launched in November 2024 and included $1.4 trillion worth of debt alleviation measures. Several more interventions were announced at China’s 2025 Two Sessions meeting.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beijing has sought to address hidden debt through a series of regulatory reforms (discussed below), which sought to close regulatory gaps around peer-to-peer financing and other forms of invisible or unregulated lending.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Xi has vowed to support indebted local governments by reforming the central-local government revenue-sharing system. Thus far, however, concrete measures have been limited.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beijing attempted to curtail real estate debt with its “three red lines” policy in 2020, which backfired when the ensuing collapse in the real estate market led to government bailouts of indebted property developers. The three red lines policy was relaxed in 2023, and the real estate sector’s looming debt remains unaddressed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vulnerability-3-shallow-financial-markets&quot;&gt;Vulnerability 3: Shallow Financial Markets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third major vulnerability in China’s financial security is its lack of appealing RMB-denominated investment assets. Economists often describe China’s markets as “shallow,” meaning that they struggle to absorb incoming capital in a way that generates strong returns for investors. This hampers Beijing’s stated goals of attracting foreign investment and deepening global financial integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping signaled a renewed commitment to improving investor access to China in his address to the Boao Forum for Asia in 2018, the 40th anniversary of Deng Xiaoping’s pivotal Reform and Opening policy. Yet despite the ongoing commitment to financial opening (金融业开放), China’s presence in international financial markets remains small relative to the size of its economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese-owned investments in foreign markets and foreign-owned assets in Chinese markets—respectively referred to as assets and liabilities in China’s international investment position—are a fraction of those of the United States and other financial powerhouses. In aggregate, China’s small international investment position reflects its limited integration with global financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5SZePTN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image39&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Modest International Investment Position&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s three largest financial markets face distinct challenges that limit investor interest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Banking&lt;/strong&gt; is subject to hands-on state intervention that steers capital toward sectors prioritized by the central government. Foreign and domestic lenders alike face pressure to support state-affiliated firms, even though returns on these loans underperform returns on private-sector lending by as much as two percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equity markets&lt;/strong&gt;, meanwhile, remain speculative and unpredictable. Despite attempts at regulatory intervention, China’s stock market performance is often untethered to the performance of its real economy, and its track record of volatility dissuades institutional investors from looking for stable sources of growth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real estate&lt;/strong&gt; was long viewed as one of the sole remaining safe havens for capital, given the lack of reliable returns on lending and equity investments. However, when China’s real estate bubble burst in 2021, would-be investors were left with few good options for investing latent savings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/30kcXph.png&quot; alt=&quot;image40&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Stocks Underperform Other Markets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced with few good domestic investment opportunities, Chinese investors have pursued investment opportunities abroad. To avoid the destabilizing effects of capital flight, Beijing maintains capital controls that limit the free flow of money in and out of China’s borders. Capital controls leave openings for some outbound investment into global markets, but Chinese investors must navigate complex investment mechanisms and cat-and-mouse regulatory enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign investors, on the other hand, are deterred from entering Chinese markets due to the risk that resources cannot be withdrawn if their investments turn sour. These concerns are augmented by heightened geopolitical risk, which investors fear could lead to further tightening of investment restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net effect is a barrier to China’s global financial integration and a threat to its long-term financial vitality. The shallowness of China’s markets stands in sharp contrast to the United States. The U.S. financial sector’s near-limitless ability to absorb capital from other countries is a consequence of its abundance of worthwhile investment opportunities. The United States remains a perennially appealing investment destination because investors know they can receive a strong rate of return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AOjAjhQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image41&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China Lags the U.S. in Inbound Investment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One upside of China’s capital controls and other barriers to financial integration is that they significantly insulate China’s financial system from external shocks. This was demonstrated during the 2008 financial crisis, which damaged the Chinese financial system less than other financial hubs. The trade-off between insulation and integration continues to confront Chinese policymakers, and heightened geopolitical risk complicates this calculus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;After a precipitous drop in foreign investment during the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese regulators have announced efforts to attract foreign investors, though these steps remain modest.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In April 2024, the State Council published new guidance on capital market regulation, calling for more conservative approaches to stock listings and strengthened supervisory approaches.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In June 2024, Chinese regulators subsequently tightened reporting requirements around stock market listings to tamp down on IPO speculation and improve transparency.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In September 2024, Shanghai and Beijing moved to relax capital controls and facilitate easier cross-border flows of funds.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s leadership has promised deeper reforms in 2025, but international observers remain skeptical.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vulnerability-4-weak-oversight-of-financial-firms&quot;&gt;Vulnerability 4: Weak Oversight of Financial Firms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s last major financial vulnerability is weak regulatory oversight, particularly in its management of firm-level financial risk. China’s financial system is distinguished by a strong state presence in firm management and capital allocation. In other words, the state has a strong say in what gets funded. Chinese policymakers use state-owned banks and investment funds to steer financial resources toward priority industries, which Beijing believes will foster long-term growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside is that these priority sectors tend to underperform in the short term. Because these firms are shielded from market logic (i.e. propped up by state support), they require scrupulous regulatory oversight to ensure their financial resources are not being mismanaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping and other officials have repeatedly emphasized the need for stronger firm-level financial governance. The narrowing gap between private and state-backed firm performance suggests these efforts have yielded some success. Nevertheless, regulatory challenges have continued to evolve as the financial landscape grows more complex, and financial planners have struggled to rise to this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qDUBe8J.png&quot; alt=&quot;image42&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Private Firms Tend to Outperform State-Backed Firms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of China’s regulatory failures stem from low state capacity. China’s financial regulators are often stretched thin, and many report inadequate resources and poor pay. These conditions make regulatory bureaucrats vulnerable to being bought off by companies seeking political favors or lighter regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is endemic corruption and regulatory capture in the state-owned sector, which surpasses every other sector besides village committees in terms of corruption cases. Xi Jinping’s flagship anti-corruption campaign has attempted to curtail the problem by threatening (and implementing) harsh punitive measures, but some scholars argue that the challenge will persist until the underlying structural issues are solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/G7snT5T.png&quot; alt=&quot;image43&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Corruption Crackdown Continues&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of low state capacity also relates to ongoing coordination challenges. In the past decade, non-traditional financial business models—like those of the now-curtailed peer-to-peer lending sector—dodged regulatory oversight by growing within the gaps of China’s mosaic of central and local regulatory agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has attempted to address this problem through several iterations of regulatory reform. The cost of these frequent regulatory reshuffles is an exacerbated sense of policy unpredictability. In an uncertain policy landscape, businesses are reluctant to invest in new ventures, particularly given Beijing’s track record of unexpectedly censuring whole industries at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these factors weaken the competitiveness of China’s financial sector in the global landscape. Foreign investors complain that they face a disadvantage against state-owned firms, which receive cheaper credit and a preferential regulatory environment. Political uncertainty chills inbound investments by limiting foreign firms’ ability to forecast costs and benefits. Finally, high-profile arrests of corporate executives have soured China’s reputation as a good place to do business, and existing leaders must take great care to avoid falling afoul of regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has restructured its financial regulatory apparatus repeatedly in recent years, though its reforms have not necessarily led to deeper liberalization.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2018, Beijing consolidated the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission into the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission and reshuffled the regulatory purview of the PBOC and other organs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beijing restructured this system again in 2023, further consolidating authority into the National Financial Regulatory Administration and establishing the Central Financial Commission within the CCP.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;State regulators have also taken steps to reform the management of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to improve returns on investors. Thus far, these efforts appear to have led to improvements in SOE stock performance.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strengths-in-chinas-financial-security&quot;&gt;Strengths in China’s Financial Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges discussed above, Beijing’s financial policymakers wield a few distinct advantages that bolster the long-term prospects for China’s financial system. Chinese policymakers have long emphasized that the “financial sector should serve the real economy,” which involves tangible goods and services. Indeed, the strongest arguments for China’s financial vitality stem not from any inherent qualities of its financial institutions but rather in the durability of its underlying economic system. China’s massive manufacturing sector, vast consumer markets, and global technology leadership all fuel the engine of growth that underpins financial resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these external sources of strength, China’s financial system also possesses three key internal advantages, each of which is analyzed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extensive trade ties&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A growing role in multilateral governance&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Innovative tools for macroeconomic regulation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strength-1-extensive-trade-ties&quot;&gt;Strength 1: Extensive Trade Ties&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s financial system benefits from its extensive trade ties. Trade has played a pivotal role in China’s economic rise and is enshrined in the 14th five-year plan as one pillar of China’s “dual circulation” strategy (国内国际双循环), which outlines an integrated economic approach to pursuing domestic and foreign market opportunities. These trade ties form a bedrock on which China can influence global financial systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese officials point to the benefits of trade ties for accelerating financial initiatives like RMB internationalization, which in turn secures and strengthens China’s financial position in a geopolitical context. Though recent rhetoric from Beijing has sought to emphasize the domestic pillar of China’s dual circulation policy, its trade network remains integral to China’s overall economic and financial posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s trade network spans the globe. In 2023, 44 countries listed China as their top overall trading partner by trade in goods, and 110 countries listed China as one of their top three sources of imports. In 2024, the combined value of China’s total goods imports and exports reached $6 trillion, returning to a healthy 5 percent year-over-year growth after an uneven performance during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pOLtCRW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image44&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Global Trade Leadership&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing leverages China’s trade network to accelerate its push for RMB internationalization. These efforts are most clearly seen in China’s imports of oil, gas, critical minerals, and other commodities. The Shanghai Petroleum and Natural Gas Exchange, Shanghai International Energy Exchange, and Ganzhou Rare Metal Exchange are three trade hubs launched in recent years that each facilitate RMB-denominated trade. As a result of these efforts, China conducted 28.8 percent of its goods trade in RMB in 2024, a 2.7 percentage point increase from 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth of RMB-denominated trade and financial institutions is not merely a matter of coercion on Beijing’s part. RMB-based financing provides some trade partners with meaningful benefits over dollar-based financing. When U.S. interest rates are high (as in the past few years), dollars become scarce, and dollar-based trade financing grows more expensive. RMB-based trade can help developing economies conserve their dollars during such periods of scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to boosting RMB internationalization, China’s trade ties provide a deterrent against the most aggressive forms of Western sanctions. The United States and its allies continue to rely deeply on trade with China, so imposing sweeping sanctions on China would result in immense blowback for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, if Western countries impose sanctions on China, China’s trade relationships with non-Western countries would provide avenues for continued economic growth. Countries within BRICS+ and China’s Belt and Road Initiative—which conceivably might not follow U.S.-led sanctions—could be willing to provide China with export markets and commodity sources even amidst a sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that China’s extensive trade relationships do come with downsides, particularly when its trade practices are perceived to distort domestic economies. Washington has made no secret of its frustration with China’s alleged manufacturing overcapacity, but less often discussed are parallel dynamics playing out across developing economies around the world. Beijing has shown some signs that it is listening to these complaints, but without more decisive action, more of China’s trade ties risk turning into diplomatic liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has cultivated its trade network through a combination of bilateral and plurilateral initiatives.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is China’s flagship platform for international development engagement. It has been used to establish infrastructure for commodity extraction and transport as well as markets for exports of Chinese manufactured goods.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BRI is a platform for other, more targeted initiatives such as the Digital Silk Road, which promotes technology-related trade and investment.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a plurilateral trade agreement signed by China and 14 other countries across the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has a total of 22 free trade agreements that reach 29 countries; 10 more free trade agreements are under negotiation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;These large-scale initiatives are complemented by more targeted platforms for specific trade, such as China’s network of commodity exchanges.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strength-2-a-growing-role-in-multilateral-governance&quot;&gt;Strength 2: A Growing Role in Multilateral Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s trade ties lend heft to Beijing’s efforts to shape multilateral financial governance, which continue to gain traction. Xi Jinping articulated China’s vision for financial governance reform at the Kazan BRICS summit in October 2024 and again at the Rio de Janeiro G20 summit in November 2024. In both addresses, Xi expressed frustration about China’s disproportionately small voice (relative to the size of the economy) in established multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s two-pronged approach for greater influence over financial governance includes reforming existing institutions and expanding the scope and remit of alternative institutions like the BRICS consortium. These efforts closely intersect with the RMB internationalization drive discussed above but also encompass a range of other mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Chinese policymakers have been steadily working to establish bilateral currency swap agreements with central banks in partner countries. These agreements provide access to RMB during periods of financial turbulence, allowing the PBOC to function as an international lender of last resort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest in RMB currency swaps has increased in recent years as dollar scarcity has created liquidity issues for many smaller economies. As of October 2024, China has signed currency swap agreements with 42 countries, with a total capacity of 3.8 trillion RMB (excluding Hong Kong and Macau). These efforts complement the RMB-based trade financing initiatives discussed above, particularly in countries with which the United States has been more reluctant to establish parallel dollar-based swap lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4VZcMv2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image45&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Growing Network of Currency Swap Agreements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Beijing has pressed for a greater role in other financial governance architecture, including financial early warning systems, reserve currency pooling agreements, and trade dispute settlement mechanisms. China’s progress on these initiatives has been uneven, but the growing ranks of countries joining China’s multilateral financial institutions point to the global appetite for alternative approaches to financial governance. The recently expanded BRICS consortium serves as Beijing’s preferred launch point for new financial architecture like the BRICS Pay cross-border payment settlement initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Beijing is pushing for a more prominent voice in established global financial governance institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO. These efforts have begun to bear fruit in the form of higher voting shares and greater presence in leadership positions, but Chinese leaders argue that they remain under-represented in these institutions.Last, China’s role as a regional financial leader is spurred by its significant development finance activity. Beijing conducts development finance diplomacy bilaterally through the BRI and multilaterally through organizations like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Shanghai-based New Development Bank (NDB). China’s role in these institutions boosts its regional financial integration and helps it shape development priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, these priorities emphasize infrastructure investment. By steering development capital toward infrastructure projects—as opposed to health or education projects, for instance—Chinese policy leaders create new markets for China’s massive industrial base. The role of overseas infrastructure projects rose in importance during the 2010s as China’s industrial base ran out of useful domestic infrastructure projects in which to invest. That said, the future of China’s development finance has been called into question amidst falling investment counts and mounting diplomatic pushback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/967mPNn.png&quot; alt=&quot;image46&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Overseas Development Finance Spending&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2024, BRICS expanded from its original constituent countries—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and later South Africa—to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia has not yet responded to an invitation to join, and Argentina was invited but declined. This wave of expansion leaves open the door for more additional to BRICS’ ranks in the coming years.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has continued efforts to expand its network of currency swap agreements, designed to boost international use of the RMB. China now has currency swap agreements with 42 countries.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China is supporting the development of the BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI), also known as BRICS Pay, as an alternative to SWIFT for managing cross-border payments. Other initiatives, like the nascent BRICS Interbank Cooperation Mechanism, are in the early days of planning.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strength-3-innovative-tools-for-macroeconomic-regulation&quot;&gt;Strength 3: Innovative Tools for Macroeconomic Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s efforts at firm-level regulation have been stymied by corruption and misaligned incentives, as discussed above, but its track record of stable governance is actually somewhat stronger. In particular, Beijing has pioneered novel tools for managing what economists refer to as macroprudential supervision (宏观审慎监管). Chinese financial regulators learned hard lessons in the wake of the 2015-16 stock market crash, which many argue was exacerbated by poor policy choices. Since then, China’s financial system has not exactly flourished, but it has avoided a repeat of systemic financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s process of iterative regulatory learning has yielded a more extensive set of tools for managing financial and monetary activity. The use of state-owned banks for monetary policy objectives is one such example. Observers have noted that in recent years, China’s state-owned banks have filled roles traditionally performed by a central bank, including stabilizing exchange rates, controlling credit volumes, and serving as lenders of last resort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These unorthodox policy tools are only possible in China’s unique state-led model of financial regulation. Early evidence suggests that these innovations augment state financial capacity and improve monetary policy efficacy, though they create oversight liabilities as well. In any case, such novel financial levers have stymied Western analysts’ standard approaches to monetary surveillance and prompted calls for revised accounting methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing maintains strong control over private and semi-private lending institutions as well. This can invite the corruption-related regulatory challenges discussed earlier, but the upshot is that private sector capital can be quickly rallied to quell crises. Since 2015, Beijing has called upon its so-called “national team” of wealth management funds (illustrated below) to buy up stocks during periods of turbulence. This strategy of enlisting quasi-public firms to support macroprudential goals is often in tension with firm-level regulation, and Chinese regulators will doubtless continue to wrestle with the appropriate balance as they continue to pursue financial reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XmoZ6nH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image47&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Key Players in China’s “National Team”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beijing increasingly uses its tight control over China’s financial institutions to direct them to support China’s macroeconomic goals. These unorthodox policy interventions would be difficult or impossible in the United States or other liberalized economies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Since 2015, Chinese financial planners have made use of a “national team” of state-backed banks and investment firms to step in and buy stocks during periods of turbulence. The most recent evidence of national team intervention was in December 2024.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Evidence also indicates Beijing has called on state-owned banks to prop up the value of the yuan by buying yuan and selling dollars during periods of depreciation, essentially using commercial banks to offload one of the central bank’s core mandates.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beijing has also issued guidance to commercial banks to reduce the interest rates for loans to other banks, in an attempt to stimulate growth by expanding credit across the economy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the vulnerabilities in China’s financial security position outweigh its strengths. This assessment is reflected in China’s uneven financial performance and faltering progress toward global financial integration. As such, it is unlikely that China’s financial system will prove an equal competitor to that of the United States, Europe, or Japan in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of China’s financial security shortcomings relate to its faltering progress toward financial liberalization. Beijing’s rhetorical praise for pursuing financial openness creates an odd juxtaposition with its policy track record, which still prefers state priorities and top-down directives. China’s policymakers attempt to square this circle with a signature two-track financial system, which carves out a space for market-based international competition while retaining a prominent role for state-owned firms. Yet foreign investors interpret Beijing’s regulatory mixed signals as an attempt to have its cake and eat it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, China’s financial system does possess significant latent strengths that draw from the scale and vitality of its economy. Chinese policymakers continue to shore up financial vulnerabilities and have recently signaled their commitment toward rebalancing the domestic economy and boosting consumption. In addition, Beijing continues to expand commercial ties with partners abroad, especially with developing economies that are frustrated with the established U.S.-led financial system and seeking alternative institutions. It remains to be seen whether these strengths will translate into sustainable growth in China’s financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

Such is the case for quantum technologies, where export controls accelerate China’s localized quantum supply chain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of quantum technologies is anticipated to bring both foundational capability advances to commercial and dual-use applications, including to computing, sensing, and the transfer of information. This makes quantum technologies a global political priority, including in the UK and the EU. Under the Biden administration, US leadership in quantum and other “force-multiplying” technologies, such as advanced semiconductors, have become a key national security imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has therefore intensified its export controls on quantum technologies aimed at China over the past year. These measures have resulted in disruptions to China’s quantum hardware and talent development, but they also accelerated China’s domestic quantum supply chain. By forcing leading laboratories and quantum start-ups to rapidly iterate with domestic suppliers in replacing foreign dependencies, export controls brought the demand side on board with Chinese localisation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the supply side, the basis for a self-reliant Chinese quantum supply chain was created years ago by strong government support and indications of US quantum controls as early as 2018. Now, with a parallel quantum ecosystem rapidly emerging, it is only a matter of time until exports from Chinese suppliers arrive in Europe. This presents both risks and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;escalating-quantum-controls-in-2024&quot;&gt;Escalating quantum controls in 2024&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the US Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) initiated a “Review of Controls for Certain Emerging Technologies”, including quantum in 2018 already, list-based US export controls on quantum computing were only finalised five years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the US mostly relied on end-user controls, placing Chinese companies, institutes and universities on its Entity List for their involvement in quantum technologies. Absent licenses (which are usually denied), this bars affected entities from importing nearly any US-origin items. The most significant additions came in 2024, when the US also finalized outbound investment controls, banning most US investments in China’s quantum sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escalating measures further, the BIS issued broad list-based quantum computing controls in September 2024 Besides requiring licenses for the export of (sufficiently powerful) quantum computers, the export of key components and related software is also restricted. For example, exporting dilution refrigerators to a Chinese research group or cryogenic circuits to a Chinese supplier of quantum computing systems would require license applications, with review policy “presumption of denial.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The September 2024 controls are internationally coordinated and introduce an exception for partnering countries that enact similar controls on quantum technologies. The UK is currently listed among all US exceptions and, alongside other European countries, Japan, and Canada, has already introduced similar controls in the months prior to US controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plurilateral alignment of the controls among an ad-hoc group of US partners is crucial to ensure that they are effective and limit self-harm. At the same time, closely tracking US controls limits the UK in independently setting rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;export-controls-are-accelerating-chinas-quantum-supply-chain&quot;&gt;Export Controls are Accelerating China’s Quantum Supply Chain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While export controls temporarily slow down Chinese quantum progress, they also turbocharge the development of a domestic supply chain and, in the long term, may run counter to the stated goal of maintaining technological competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long delay leading up to the current quantum export controls has given Chinese planners and entrepreneurs time to prepare. Compared to the deep and highly specialised semiconductor supply chain, the quantum supply chain is still more shallow and dispersed, making it more feasible to innovate around restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the restrictions, convincing buyers to choose unproven, local suppliers over established international alternatives was a key hurdle for Chinese upstream suppliers. Export controls limited the extent to which international companies could sell into China, forcing downstream labs and companies in China to turn to local alternatives and do their best to help them succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even where foreign options still exist, local suppliers often outperform foreign ones at service, especially on-premises repairs and support – something that would otherwise require a shipment to Europe or the US. Export controls exacerbate this competitive disadvantage by complicating customs procedures and adding uncertainty to the availability of cross-border support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s commercial quantum ecosystem is frequently belittled: Chinese big tech largely left the sector, and state laboratories dominate the most impressive announcements. Nonetheless, comparing the competition in quantum to a “struggle between private free enterprise and state-directed communism” fails to recognize Chinese efforts to create a thriving commercial quantum ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of expanding commercial activity, China’s Quantum Internet Industry Alliance was established in 2022 and has since grown to over 90 members. In China’s leading university for quantum science, the market-driven commercialisation of research results is explicitly encouraged, with many resulting quantum start-ups. This system – including shared benefits for both the university and researchers to incentivize commercial application – is not dissimilar to Western universities, including in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More venture capital for quantum start-ups, admittedly dominated by government funds, is also a recent political priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-reliant supply chains for microwave interconnects and dilution refrigerators are less flashy than quantum supremacy claims, but they are part of the rapidly advancing foundation for China’s future quantum industry, accelerated by recent export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;contrary-to-western-perceptions-china-is-still-keen-to-internationalise-its-quantum-sector&quot;&gt;Contrary to Western Perceptions, China is Still Keen to Internationalise its Quantum Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s quantum strategy is often framed as intentionally insular in Western media. While a push towards self-reliance is indeed central in China’s science and technology planning, relative to the US and the UK, China’s quantum sector is currently less securitised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading Chinese quantum researchers call for international collaboration, foreign involvement in China’s quantum industry is officially encouraged, and China’s own quantum export controls are mostly limited to licenses for quantum cryptography and cryogenic components. In a recent call with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Xi Jinping highlighted quantum for the cultivation of “incremental cooperation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official Chinese proclamations of benign open innovation do deserve scepticism due to stated ambitions of self-reliant technological dominance in key sectors. However, these same ambitions rely on participation in global standards, high-tech exports, and access to global IP, making an insular quantum strategy an unlikely proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Chinese policy documents frame quantum technologies as a “future industry”, contrasted to a US approach that highlights quantum as a “national security imperative” with a more narrow focus on leading capabilities. This resembles the situation in AI, where US policymakers see an arms race to super intelligence while Xi Jinping emphasises broad applications and (open source) ecosystem building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s national security whitepaper acknowledges quantum technologies as a “double-edged sword” but insists that cooperation and win-win results are unstoppable. With “non-development” framed as the biggest security risk, more scientific and technological Chinese exports bolster China’s national security by proving the competitiveness of local champions, shaping global standards, and boosting economic development. In this view, quantum is just one piece in China’s broader strategy to move up the value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the current stage, it is therefore likely that Chinese quantum export restrictions remain largely limited to dual-use applications, as opposed to more comprehensive sectoral controls in the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brutal domestic competition will create export pressure in China’s quantum supply chain, exacerbated by local government competition and many new entrants following the call to develop “future industries” and hoping to fill the void left by foreign supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While one should not expect Chinese quantum computers in European HPC centres anytime soon, the upstream supply chain in photonics, electronics, cryogenics and vacuum systems is bound to see Chinese entrants. Take the example of Precilaser, whose laser sources are used in quantum experiments. Besides taking domestic market share, Precilaser has exported nearly one hundred sets to Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, this export market is still in its infancy, with little international patenting for example. This gives policymakers in the UK time to consider both the risks and opportunities from the participation of Chinese quantum companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uks-handling-of-the-coming-chinese-quantum-exports&quot;&gt;The UK’s Handling of the Coming Chinese Quantum Exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike dependencies in end-devices such as 5G infrastructure, Chinese components in quantum R&amp;amp;D pose few direct security risks. Still, due to the importance of quantum technology to future economic security and the recent emphasis on technological sovereignty, the UK should monitor dependencies on Chinese suppliers and decide what it deems and does not deem acceptable. This is especially true for military procurement, which aims to expand links with deep tech and agile start-ups, including in quantum, among the reorganizations called for by the UK’s recent Strategic Defence Review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if policy makers look beyond the defence tech angle, they will see that preventively closing the door to Chinese exports or introducing costly screening procedures risks doing more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of quantum technologies is a long game, with some of the most significant foundational applications likely still more than 10 years in the future. It is unlikely that the Western quantum ecosystem will out-innovate an increasingly decoupled Chinese quantum sector across the board. Retaining channels through which innovations and new technological paradigms can diffuse to the UK is the prudent choice. This is often overlooked in the current emphasis on protecting Western innovations through export controls, implicitly assuming enduring and comprehensive Western leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides export controls, import controls and government screening of business transactions will become more important as quantum technologies are adopted in the wider economy. The US already does the former, and the UK explicitly lists quantum technologies in its “National Security and Investment Act.” These tools should be applied with caution. Joint projects, such as a reported quantum computing centre by China-based Origin Quantum in Spain, could create valuable pathways for diffusion and insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often, the quantum competition is seen purely through a national security lens, with policy tools chosen accordingly. Yet the reason that companies, and the Chinese government, invest billions in quantum technologies is firstly quantum’s potential as a future industry. This is no zero-sum competition, and as the sector matures, the UK should consider borrowing from China’s own past toolbox on technology transfer and local partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to China’s quantum supply chain, if established gradually, can contribute to a competitive UK quantum ecosystem, with companies able to build with the best there is in every category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a potential conflict in the Indo-Pacific theatre, contested logistics will make sustainment and repair of U.S. Air Force (USAF) aircraft difficult. The USAF should consider collaborating with allies and partners to develop the capability to sustain its aircraft near the conflict zone, reinforcing deterrence and enhancing warfighting ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is a key U.S. ally in the region, possessing advanced technical capabilities, a long-standing relationship with the USAF, and an increased strategic focus on its own defense industrial base. Maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) collaboration could be mutually beneficial for Japan and the United States, providing cost savings, predictable demand, and integration that could strengthen credible deterrence against a common adversary. By leveraging each nation’s strengths, Japan and the United States could bolster their defense capabilities, increase resilience, and better prepare for a potential conflict for a potential conflict in the Inso-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is well positioned to be a capable MRO partner for the USAF. The nation has a strong commercial aviation industry that has existing relationships with U.S. companies. Some of these relationships extend to the military aviation industry, creating opportunities for further integration and expansion of military MRO capabilities, particularly for several military aircraft that are flown by both countries. Japan has recently made investments in its defense industrial base and revised its export regulations, enabling closer defense cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USAF MRO in Japan would build upon a robust set of existing frameworks and strategies focused on addressing sustainment challenges in the Indo-Pacific. The Defense Industrial Cooperation, Acquisition, and Sustainment (DICAS) Forum established an open dialogue on MRO with Japan in 2024. The Partnership for Indo-Pacific Industrial Resilience (PIPIR), also launched in 2024, brings together industrial and international partners to integrate MRO strategies. The Global Enterprise Network for Universal Sustainment (GENUS), a USAF program, expands depot maintenance capabilities to ally and partner countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are challenges to U.S.-Japan MRO cooperation, including export controls that delay the exchange of knowledge, labor, and capital; technical challenges like differing manufacturing standards and quality controls; and a lack of consensus about who will bear the financial burden of investment in expanding capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report identifies recommendations on how to accelerate cooperation to meet the urgent strategic imperative of enhanced MRO capabilities in the Indo-Pacific. The United States could expand on physical and diplomatic infrastructure, send clear demand signals to industry, and use Other Transaction Authority (OTA) to allow U.S. companies to explore collaborative opportunities. Both the United States and Japan could identify common systems for MRO cooperation, increase the alignment of their manufacturing standards, embrace modular designs for future acquisition programs, and conduct an exercise to evaluate current joint sustainment capabilities and gaps. Japanese industry could leverage its strong commercial aerospace assets by adapting knowledge, labor, and facilities to support military MRO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USAF is globally postured, with bases, airmen, and aircraft forward positioned across the world to protect and advance the United States’ geostrategic interests. Such a far-flung footprint, while strategically advantageous, creates its own challenges, especially in maintaining USAF aircraft in theater when potential conflicts are likely to involve contested logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges associated with forward presence are particularly evident in the United States Indo-Pacific Command Area of Responsibility. The Indo-Pacific region fuels much of the world’s economic growth and, through trade, supports more than 3 million American jobs. As the source of nearly $900 billion in foreign direct investment into the United States, the region has great importance for U.S. national and economic security. Japan is a key U.S. ally in the Indo-Pacific that is investing in advanced defense capabilities and promoting defense industrial cooperation with the United States to enhance jointness and interoperability. Japan’s highly capable industry has the potential to help alleviate the USAF’s maintenance and contested logistics challenges in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the United States and Japan have already taken steps to advance cooperation in aircraft maintenance and repair. The United States has established multiple dialogues and frameworks, such as the DICAS Forum, dedicated to partnering with Japan and exploring sustainment solutions in the Indo-Pacific. Japan has made investments in its defense industrial base and aligned its export laws to enhance defense collaboration, demonstrating its commitment to expanding its defense posture and industry. The United States and Japan should consider building upon and accelerating these efforts as a way to overcome the challenges of maintenance cooperation and meet the urgent strategic need for enhanced sustainment capabilities in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-and-operational-challenges&quot;&gt;Strategic and Operational Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan faces a rapidly deteriorating regional security environment. China’s coercive tactics in the East China Sea, including continued deployments of government vessels into the Senkaku Islands’ territorial waters, are having a corrosive effect on regional security. China is consistently and clearly demonstrating a desire to reshape the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific region. China and Russia have increased their joint bomber exercises in the North Pacific and their flying of uncrewed aerial systems (UASs) near Japan’s southwest islands, leading the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) to scramble fighter jets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An emboldened North Korea, armed with advanced Russian military technology, has also increased the importance of Japanese deterrence and defense capabilities. China has not actively sought a trilateral partnership with North Korea and Russia, but both China and North Korea have supported Russia’s weapons manufacturing since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. North Korea has long posed a threat to regional security, and deterrence strategies must now account for a North Korea that is armed with both nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles and is capable of delivering them to Japan and even to the West Coast of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distance between the United States and the Indo-Pacific presents operational challenges for the U.S. military, particularly in the maintenance of USAF aircraft. Located thousands of miles away from China—its “pacing threat”—the United States faces significant challenges due to its geographic separation from its allies in the Indo-Pacific region. The tyranny of distance complicates U.S. efforts to bolster deterrence. In addition to these challenges, the Department of Defense (DOD) faces slower response times and repair delays due to export controls and other bureaucratic hurdles that complicate the performance of repairs outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In North America, the United States is also confronting difficult conditions that exacerbate these challenges. Operating on peacetime footing, “the U.S. defense industrial ecosystem lacks the capacity, responsiveness, flexibility, and surge capability to meet the U.S. military’s production and warfighting needs.” Beyond these production shortcomings, the United States also faces hurdles and inefficiencies from overly restrictive or outdated arms transfer policies and institutions such as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, as well serious workforce inadequacies and shortages. Collectively, these constraints have a negative impact on supply chain resilience, military readiness, and sustainment efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond military security difficulties, Japan has also been forced to reckon with challenges in its defense industrial base, where capacity has suffered due to falling profits, higher costs of technology development, and increased government acquisition spending on foreign technologies over the past decade. This is particularly of note because defense contracts make up only a small fraction of overall revenue for large Japanese companies doing work for Japan’s Ministry of Defense (MOD). While this means that Japanese companies are more diversified and better equipped to manage financial instability and fluctuations in defense sales, it also means that top management is not singularly focused on managing and growing their defense sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the United States’ most important allies in the Indo-Pacific, Japan could play a key role in ensuring deterrence in the region by helping to overcome the difficulties of contested logistics via cooperation on aircraft maintenance. As discussed below, Japanese companies have strong capabilities in aircraft MRO but currently face challenges in meeting the USAF’s MRO needs in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deterrence-strategy-in-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;Deterrence Strategy in the Indo-Pacific&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the United States and Japan grapple with growing threats in the Indo-Pacific region, both countries have placed greater emphasis on deterring aggression from potential adversaries. China continues to be an overriding strategic concern, as highlighted in Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s initial message to the force on January 25, 2025, where he stressed the importance of working with allies and partners to “deter aggression in the Indo-Pacific by Communist China.” In March 2025, Hegseth called Japan an “indispensable partner” in deterring China and confirmed plans to upgrade of the U.S. military command in Japan to a Joint Force Headquarters. This upgrade allows for improved coordination of bilateral operations between the United States and Japan and is aimed at reestablishing deterrence in the Indo-Pacific. These remarks came during Hegseth’s meeting with Japanese Defense Minister Nakatani Gen, in which the two officials agreed to accelerate the process of maintaining U.S. aircraft and ships in Japan, as well as to move forward with plans to jointly produce certain missiles, such as Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USAF contributes to the deterrence mission and has operated in Japan for decades, with aircraft stationed at Kadena Air Base, Misawa Air Base, and Yokota Air Base. Dr. Troy Meink, during his nomination hearing for secretary of the Air Force in March 2025, stated that “China poses the largest plausible military threat to the United States of America, as well as our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region.” China has the largest air force in the Indo-Pacific and is rapidly modernizing and advancing its power-projection capabilities with high levels of military spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of USAF deterrence strategy is building credibility through the establishment of effective military infrastructure. One component of that strategy is the Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI), a set of targeted investments that “enhance U.S. force posture, infrastructure, presence, and readiness as well as the capacity and capabilities of U.S. Allies and partners, specifically in the Indo-Pacific region.” In FY 2025, the PDI requested $9.9 billion across six investment categories, including logistics and maintenance capabilities, prepositioning of equipment, and ally and partner capabilities. Investments in the region, from building new facilities to strengthening the capability of allies and partners, are credible commitments to the region’s defense. The PDI is a signal to adversaries that the United States is dedicated to spending time and money building up its force posture and readiness in the Pacific, translating directly to a willingness to fight and win a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;contested-logistics-and-the-importance-of-mro&quot;&gt;Contested Logistics and the Importance of MRO&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflict in the Indo-Pacific will be challenging due to the region’s distance from the United States and the growing difficulties of contested logistics, all of which put assets at an increased risk. Contested logistics is defined by the USAF as “an environment in which an adversary presents challenges in all domains and directly targets logistics, operations, facilities, and activities in the United States and abroad, or in transit from one location to another.” To overcome the challenges of contested logistics, the USAF aims to improve forward posture by utilizing information management, enabling agile combat deployment, and fielding improved active and passive defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any potential conflict will provide China with opportunities to contest and disrupt the United States’ supply chains and logistics. Readily available, pre-staged military assets that would allow U.S. and allied forces to provide protection, intelligence, and sustainment right away in the event of a conflict are crucial. Reducing the time it takes to surge resources from the United States into the Indo-Pacific would help to defeat the tyranny of distance. MRO capabilities in-theater are critical to overcoming these logistics challenges and maintaining deterrence. In-country maintenance capabilities reduce the risk of attack on systems that are being ferried to and from the continental United States for maintenance and makes these systems available more rapidly. It also reduces the demand for additional assets like tankers and ensures that pilots can remain forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-potential-of-us-japanese-collaboration&quot;&gt;The Potential of U.S.-Japanese Collaboration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges of maintaining deterrence and overcoming contested logistics in the Indo-Pacific have deepened the importance of joint efforts between the United States and Japan to enhance defense industrial cooperation, strategic integration, and sustainment. Both countries stand to gain from regional integrated deterrence, increases in interoperability, and coordination of strategic goals and efforts. By leveraging their individual strengths, Japan and the United States could collectively build their defense industrial bases and better prepare for a possible conflict with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MRO offers a way to deepen cooperation. Considered a crucial component of military readiness and international defense partnerships, MRO is critical for sustainment efforts and a primary enabler of U.S. military operations. By the DOD’s definition, maintenance and repair pertain specifically to “the overhaul, upgrading, or rebuilding of parts, assemblies, or subassemblies, and the testing and reclamation of equipment.” For the USAF, MRO operations mainly revolve around maintaining aircraft and supplying forces with the necessary parts, pieces, and equipment to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD splits maintenance into two categories: field level and depot level. Field-level maintenance refers to organizational maintenance—which can include inspections, servicing, and preventative maintenance—as well as intermediate maintenance, which includes assembly and disassembly. Field-level maintenance includes shop-type work and on-equipment maintenance, both of which are normally performed by an operating unit on a day-to-day basis. Depot-level maintenance is material maintenance or repair that requires overhaul, upgrading, or rebuilding of parts or components. Each military service has its own depot-level maintenance infrastructure, requiring specialized tools, equipment, and uniquely trained personnel. More complicated than maintenance are modifications and overhauls. Modifications involve changing components or software; they often need to be done by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), either in-country or back in the United States. MRO operations feature differing degrees of specialization, ranging from simple maintenance at more rudimentary levels to specific modifications that require particular facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government has advocated for the country’s industry to expand its support for U.S. MRO operations in the Indo-Pacific. As MOD has stated, “In general, conducting maintenance and repairs in Japan on U.S. Navy vessels and U.S. Air Force aircraft deployed in the vicinity of Japan, without them returning to mainland U.S., will contribute to strengthening Japan’s defence production and technological bases.” Such maintenance and repair work will also improve “the readiness of U.S. forces by shortening the repair period and increasing efficiency,” a spokesperson stated in 2022, adding that this would improve the “deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. alliance.” This sentiment is in close alignment with Japanese strategic policy as outlined in Japan’s National Defense Strategy and as evidenced by the country’s increasing defense budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States already addresses some of its maintenance needs in Japan. The U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps contract Japanese companies for maintenance on some aircraft, such as the F/A-18E/F and V-22. Some MRO has also been done on U.S. Navy ships at Japanese shipyards. While the USAF has existing capacities at Kadena, Japanese firms could be called upon to assist the USAF in performing more MRO operations in-theater than is currently possible by contributing extra parts, components, technicians, and capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent strategic messaging, investment, and global engagement show encouraging signs of progress for MRO cooperation between the United States and Japan. A key path to overcoming the challenges of cooperation will be to build upon the existing foundation of MRO collaboration, including physical and diplomatic infrastructure. The remainder of this report will examine what the United States and Japan can do to build on existing efforts and further catalyze MRO cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-and-report-overview&quot;&gt;Methodology and Report Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report draws on interviews, private roundtables, a public event, and independent research to provide an overview of the possibilities for greater cooperation between the United States and Japan on MRO of USAF airplanes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS held two private roundtables that brought together key stakeholders from both countries and other subject matter experts. The first roundtable occurred in October 2024 and focused on Japanese industry. The second roundtable took place in January 2025 and featured greater representation from U.S. industry. A public event held at CSIS in March offered the opportunity for government and industry figures to voice their perspectives to the policy community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry research was compiled from interviews and written surveys as well as from the roundtables. Virtual interviews were conducted with five U.S. companies, and survey answers were collected from six Japanese companies. U.S. and Japanese companies were asked about their current MRO activities, the challenges and opportunities for MRO work with the partner nation, and other topics such as investments and production dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2 of this report describes the current state of USAF MRO efforts in Japan and offers data-driven insights into current MRO cooperation. Chapters 3 and 4 sort MRO cooperation challenges in Japan and the United States, respectively, into a typology of barriers. Chapter 5 discusses enablers of greater cooperation. Finally, Chapter 6 provides recommendations to industry and policymakers in the United States and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-state-of-usaf-mro-in-japan&quot;&gt;Current State of USAF MRO in Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USAF has long maintained a dedicated MRO hub in Japan. The Support Center Pacific (SCP), located at Kadena Air Base, has been providing parts and repair services for USAF assets in the region for over 40 years. The SCP primarily produces depot-level repair parts; in 2013, for instance, it provided over 3,000 assets to the theater. With over 90 employees, the SCP has the capability to maintain a wide range of aircraft and service more than 125 different aircraft components from both the USAF and foreign militaries, including Taiwanese F-16s. The center provides in-theater services for the A-10, C-5, C-130, F-16, F-15C/D, F-15E, KC-135, HH-60, E-3, and MQ-9 aircraft, and works with allied forces within the supply chain to ensure swift support of air assets. The center’s skilled workforce has an average of 20 years of experience and is cross-trained to handle multiple functions, giving the SCP flexibility to meet the changing needs of the USAF and allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the SCP provides the USAF with a significant independent capability in Japan, the United States continues to seek out joint solutions to sustainment in contested logistics environments. In 2024, the DOD rolled out a new plan to launch military repair hubs across the Indo-Pacific. Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore, and the Philippines were named as partners in this expansion of the DOD’s network of repair hubs across the world. The announcement aligns with the Regional Sustainment Framework (RSF), which advances collaboration with allies and partners as a solution to conducting MRO closer to the point of need, avoiding the costly and time-consuming process of sending military equipment back to the United States for repairs. While the DOD’s network of MRO hubs contributes to integrated deterrence, these hubs are also prepared to handle “battle-damaged equipment” in the event of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanded MRO cooperation with Japan would also build on existing relationships between the U.S. government and Japanese industry. The Komaki South Plant, operated by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), functions as a regional depot for the F-35 airframe. The Mizuho Plant, operated by IHI Corporation, also functions as a regional depot for the F-35, specifically its F135 engine. The potential expansion of Japan’s aircraft servicing capacity would match the country’s strategic shift toward increasing its domestic defense capacity, defense spending, and focus on national security. Servicing and maintaining USAF aircraft in Japan will significantly reduce the turnaround time of returning aircraft to service, bolstering regional security and partially solving the pressing issue of MRO logistics in potentially contested environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;institutional-frameworks-and-strategies-for-cooperation&quot;&gt;Institutional Frameworks and Strategies for Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD has a robust set of institutional frameworks and strategies focused on addressing sustainment challenges and deterrence obstacles faced by the Air Force in the Indo-Pacific region. These emphasize the importance of MRO operations and the critical leveraging of relationships with allies and partners. For example, the RSF seeks to bring together industrial and international partners to strengthen MRO capabilities overseas. By prioritizing engagement with allies and partners, the RSF strives to “build a collective and resilient co-sustainment ecosystem” that can enhance military readiness, quickly respond to persistent threats, and deter regional aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RSF builds on the strategic and operational priorities outlined in the Pacific Air Force (PACAF) Strategy 2030, which provides direction to the command’s 46,000 Airmen and civilians across strategic areas, including resilient basing, contested logistics, and the training of multi-capable Airmen. As reflected in this and other foundational USAF policies, collaborative MRO efforts like reciprocal aerial refueling and maintenance integration are critical to enhancing the USAF’s adaptability and ensuring aircraft are airworthy and ready to fly, enabling Airmen to leverage their skills and experience in contested environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defense Industrial Cooperation, Acquisition, and Sustainment (DICAS) Forum is another key enabler in the U.S. defense industrial toolkit that makes joint projects mutually beneficial to Japan and the United States. Similarly to the RSF, DICAS seeks to “accelerate coordination toward co-development, co-production, and co-sustainment” by pursuing mutually beneficial objectives, tackling obstacles jointly, and expanding defense industrial base opportunities for both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the Partnership for Indo-Pacific Industrial Resilience (PIPIR) directly supports the RSF and the DOD’s implementation of the National Defense Industrial Strategy (NDIS). PIPIR is focused on enhancing defense industrial collaboration between the United States and its allies in the region. Centered around a core vision statement that defines strategic principles to guide collaboration, PIPIR has brought partners together around four workstreams: sustainment, production, supply chain resilience, and policy and optimization. Having agreed that the delivery of material solutions is integral to defense industrial resilience, the 13 countries that comprise PIPIR have appointed leadership for each workstream and committed to the creation of an advisory board to complement and inform joint efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USAF’s Global Enterprise Network for Universal Sustainment (GENUS) compliments RSF, PIPIR and DICAS by focusing on the expansion of depot maintenance capabilities beyond the shores of the United States, including in the Indo-Pacific. The USAF will operationalize RSF using the GENUS framework. By leveraging relationships with allies and partners around the world, GENUS aims to strengthen alliances, processes, and capabilities to increase depot-level max capacity, embed personnel, and improve regional supply chains. The framework aims to bring aircraft component repair capabilities to regional repair facilities in places such as Japan. The USAF is investing in Forward Air Logistics Complex Operational Nodes (FALCON) to embed depot-level maintenance within operational units, offering a further opportunity for aircraft repair to take place in Japan. In remarks at an event hosted by CSIS in March 2025, Lt. Gen. Stacey T. Hawkins described Japan as a prime candidate for FALCON expansion due to its strong existing military partnership with the United States and discussed the potential for partnership with Japanese industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aircraft-mro-in-the-data&quot;&gt;Aircraft MRO in the Data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the growing strength of institutions designed to enable defense industrial cooperation, U.S.-Japanese cooperation on the MRO of USAF aircraft in Japan would build upon a strong foundation of existing contracts and relationships between the U.S. military and Japanese companies, many of which have worked on contracts for the U.S. military for decades. Japanese firms have cooperated with U.S. firms to produce aircraft parts like Stage 1 Integrally Bladed Rotors for the F135, for example, the manufacture of which began in 2024. Local firms have already provided MRO services for U.S. Navy aircraft, such as the F/A-18, in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of the DOD’s Japan-related MRO contracts are already with Japanese vendors, except in a few specialized categories. Figure 1 depicts DOD MRO product and service contracts for aircraft from 2012–23 that are either conducted in Japan, held by a Japanese company or linked to a Japanese parent company, or that use materials that are majority Japanese in origin. U.S.-owned vendors hold all contracts in quality control, testing, and inspections due to the highly technical nature of this category; the same is true for technical representatives, as U.S. OEMs send their own engineers to Japan to work on their aircraft when there are restrictions on intellectual property (IP) or other constraints. In a conversation with CSIS, a U.S. industry representative explained that in some cases, engineers from the OEMs are the only ones who that can perform repairs because the OEMs own the IP. Outside these specialized categories, the data suggests that Japanese industry is capable of performing a majority of the MRO work being done in that country—especially in maintenance and repairs, the largest and most labor-intensive category of MRO activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rRxx9bF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2014 DOD initiative that named Australia and Japan as F-35 heavy maintenance hubs for the Asia-Pacific region corresponds with the upticks in maintenance and repair contracts in 2014, 2018, and 2020. The F-35 maintenance facilities were expected to be operational by 2018, with Australia initially chosen to provide heavy maintenance to the F135 engine and Japan providing additional capability three to five years later. In Japan, MHI’s Final Assembly and Check Out facility in Nagoya was selected as the regional MRO provider; the facility unveiled the first Japanese-assembled F-35A in 2017. As part of the 2014 initiative, MHI began conducting inspections and repairs of F-35 airframes at its Aichi facility in 2020, after which there was an uptick in contract awards in maintenance and repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: DOD Prime Contracts for Aircraft MRO with a Japanese Aspect by Contracting Agency.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: FPDS and CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USAF is not the main spender of DOD MRO funds related to Japan. Figure 2 shows all DOD prime contracts on aircraft MRO performed in Japan, divided by service. The majority of DOD funds spent on MRO with a Japanese aspect are paid by the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), an agency that administers contracts, provides oversight, and ensures effective contract management. The DCMA typically focuses on high-value and high-risk contracts that directly support increased warfighter readiness, avoiding any contract below $300,000 and non-mission service work. In Figure 2, the “Air Force” and “Navy” sections represent the actual value of MRO contracts being performed in Japan, while DCMA contracts can concern products or services that are destined for the USAF, Navy, or any other military service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data in Figure 2 illustrates that U.S-Japan defense industrial cooperation on MRO is not only relevant for the USAF but also for the U.S. Navy, whose partnership with Japanese industry dates in 1953, when NIPPI, a Japanese corporation, began servicing Navy assets. NIPPI currently provides maintenance support for the Marine Corps’ V-22 Osprey helicopters. Japanese companies also service U.S. Navy ships, with MHI conducting maintenance on the USS Millus in 2019 and recently signaling its openness to additional contracts with the U.S. Navy. Expanded MRO cooperation could benefit the U.S. military broadly, not just the USAF, and has already begun to accelerate in some other services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3BDzkA3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: DOD Prime Contracts for Aircraft MRO with a Japanese Aspect by Type of MRO Activity Across Aircraft Product Categories.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: FPDS and CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 3 shows all DOD prime contracts with a Japanese aspect, segmented by the activities being performed on different aircraft parts and the type of MRO activity involved. The data shows that technical representatives are mostly performing work on components and accessories and that aircraft/airframes are receiving only general maintenance work. The topline of $30 million also shows a very limited amount of MRO with a Japanese aspect, meaning there is significant room for growth. The trend points upward on maintenance of aircraft and airframes, as more USAF aircraft are deployed to Japan and as the USAF seeks in-country sustainment solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engines and sub-suppliers are not included in this data, which means that Figure 3 does not capture some of the important MRO work being performed by Japanese companies, such as IHI’s supply of parts for and repairs of the F135 engine in Japan. As mentioned above, in 2023, IHI opened the first regional depot outside of those run directly by F-35 partner nations to provide services for the F135 engine for both the USAF and JASDF; in 2024, the company began shipping F135 Stage 1 Integrally Bladed Rotors to Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney in the United States, becoming the only external vendor with this capability. This activity is likely not represented in the data because IHI is not the prime contractor for the engine, but rather a subcontractor to Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney. Significantly more Japanese industry participation in MRO is likely happening at the sub-supplier level and therefore will not be included in DOD prime contract data. Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney have expanded their MRO presence in Japan through partnerships with MHI and IHI, with two facilities operational as of 2023. This expansion demonstrates an expectation of a continued uptick in MRO contracts with a Japanese aspect, mirroring the increases seen in aircraft and airframe MRO from 2018 through 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japanese-industry-and-government-challenges&quot;&gt;Japanese Industry and Government Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese industry and government face a variety of barriers in facilitating MRO support for USAF aircraft. To categorize barriers to cooperation, this section draws on insights from project team research, roundtables, and interviews with key stakeholders. The chapter focuses on barriers that directly impact Japan’s government and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To categorize these barriers, this report draws on a 2023 RAND report that offers a typology of barriers to U.S. security cooperation with highly capable allies in a variety of domains. CSIS previously modified this typology in a March 2025 report on U.S.-Australia defense industrial integration to include a new classification of the economic barriers experienced by industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/npK53bz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

Moroney et al., Overcoming Barriers to Working with Highly Capable Allies and Partners in the Air, Space, and Cyber Domains: An Exploratory Analysis (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, July 2023)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;budgetary-and-strategic-barriers&quot;&gt;Budgetary and Strategic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Japan has highly advanced technological expertise and a robust manufacturing base, the domestic demand for defense industrial capacity is limited due to the size of the Japan Self-Defense Force (JSDF) and its aviation arm, the JASDF. The JASDF operates approximately 700 aircraft, while the USAF operates over 5,100. The USAF has over 350 planes stationed in Japan, with dozens of new fighter jets scheduled to deploy to Japan as a part of a $10 billion investment aimed at bolstering fighter jet operations across multiple military bases in the country. Adding aircraft MRO demand from USAF to that of JASDF would encourage Japanese industry to expand its capacity to meet this new market opportunity in the long run. In the short term, however, Japanese industry may struggle to “right-size” or scale up its MRO operations to match demand, especially if USAF demand is not seen as guaranteed (discussed below). Additionally, the number of airframes per system that would undergo MRO in Japan matters. Building Japanese MRO capacity for a U.S. system with only two aircraft in Japan, for example, would incur a high per-unit cost, which could be unjustifiable if there is existing MRO capacity for these aircraft in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weapons and ammunition depots store military equipment and parts and maintain their readiness, making in-theater storage depots essential for deterrence and the conduct of military operations. A central question regarding Japan’s defense capacity is the availability of storage depots that can ensure Japanese manufacturers have access to critical parts for MRO and other necessary materiel if a conflict breaks out. There are approximately 1,400 active weapons depots in Japan, but many are located in the north of the country, and larger depots are needed to house the long-range missiles that Japan moved to acquire in 2023. These depots are both a strategic necessity and expensive to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bureaucratic-barriers&quot;&gt;Bureaucratic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Prime Minister Kishida Fumio eased the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology, or Japanese arms export regulations, in 2023. The revision has opened the door to the export of lethal weapons to the United States and other partner countries by allowing the transfer of finished products and components to the licensing country. The stated purpose of these revisions is to strengthen regional deterrence, reinforcing the impression that Japan is committed to mobilizing defense transfers for national security. In interviews and surveys conducted by CSIS in January and February 2025, U.S. and Japanese industry representatives acknowledged the benefit of revised Japanese export control laws but have also noted that process change takes time. The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) is working to comply with updated export regulations, which will take training and cultural change. Both Japanese and U.S. industry are hoping for METI to become more efficient, as delays in the export process are reported to be hampering work and increasing costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cultural-and-political-barriers&quot;&gt;Cultural and Political Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically limited in scope, JSDF operations have evolved over time in response to changes in the security environment around Japan. Japan issued its first national security strategy in 2013, reflecting the security challenges posed by China and North Korea. The defense policy reforms of 2015 marked a substantial turning point in Japan’s defense policy, reflecting the country’s willingness to participate in collective security efforts with allies and partners in specific circumstances. In 2022, Japan released its second national security strategy, identifying China as its greatest strategic challenge, and issued a new defense strategy and procurement plan in tandem, outlining plans to increase military expenditures from 1 percent to 2 percent of GDP by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the legacy of World War II and the pacifism enshrined in Japan’s postwar constitution still impact Japanese defense industrial capacity and regulations, as well as the workforce that Japanese defense industry attracts. For example, in recruiting ads, the JSDF depicts its activities as providing medical assistance and engaging in rescue missions, both at home and overseas—unlike U.S. military recruiting, which highlights warfighting. Although the Japanese government has reinterpreted Article 9 of its constitution, which renounces war and the threat or use of force to resolve international disputes, a culture of pacifism still prevails, complicating efforts to strengthen Japan’s defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negative public opinion of the defense industry makes it difficult for defense companies to hire skilled talent, especially as Japan contends with a demographic challenge (research projects a 12 percent reduction in the working population from 2022 to 2040). Japan’s worker shortage comes at a time when defense companies need more skilled labor than ever to expand capacity, and are competing for talent with other high-growth and specialized industries such as automotive engineering, manufacturing, sustainability, and other innovative technology areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military’s forward presence in Japan—per Article 6 of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty—may be excellent for strategic positioning, but it also proves politically sensitive in some local communities. Okinawa is a hub for the U.S. military, hosting 70 percent of all U.S. bases in Japan, including Kadena Air Base, and housing 80,000 Americans. The large U.S. military presence has strained relations with Okinawans since the 1970s, and there have been periodic incidents of violence. Though this is not a challenge unique to Japan, it poses a barrier to the expansion of MRO facilities for U.S. military aircraft, as local populations could protest new facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regulatory-barriers&quot;&gt;Regulatory Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States uses export controls like the International Traffic in Arms Regulations to ensure advanced U.S. technology is not transferred to unfriendly actors. Although limiting access to critical technologies and military capabilities is essential to maintaining a technological advantage, ITAR delays and in some cases obstructs the United States’ ability to export critical parts to foreign allied partners, like those needed by Japanese industry to perform MRO services on U.S. aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge mentioned in CSIS’s conversations with Japanese industry stakeholders is obtaining certifications from OEMs and securing the technical disclosures that they provide to MRO partners. Each U.S. company that originally manufactures an aircraft has its own quality and process standards that Japanese industry must follow to perform MRO on its planes. Overclassification of information can greatly complicate the sharing of critical enabling details like these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technical-barriers&quot;&gt;Technical Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After World War II, Japan adopted proprietary standards for its self-defense forces, creating a barrier to cooperation on MRO and FMS with foreign militaries. As the United States’ alliance structure in Asia revolves around bilateral relationships, the Indo-Pacific lacks a multilateral security organization like NATO in Europe to set standards for interoperability. Japan’s ban—due to cultural challenges mentioned above—on the export of lethal weapons also resulted in a lack of emphasis on aligning standards, as common standards are often profitable only if tied to enhancing success in foreign military sales (or alliance interoperability). Without the benefits of foreign sales, adopting foreign standards would have been costly for the small Japanese aircraft fleet. These strategic and cultural dynamics have created a legacy that is complicating modern MRO cooperation with the United States and other partners, as many of the parts used in Japan are not compatible with U.S. systems and standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lack of shared standards between the United States and Japan not only means that parts may not fit together, but also that the technology within subsystems may not interface easily. Standards apply beyond just physical characteristics: Test and Evaluation requirements, for instance, can apply to parts in Japan that may be functionally identical to U.S. parts but that can still be manufactured or evaluated using processes that the USAF or U.S. primes do not view as aligning with their standards, and thus cannot be incorporated into MRO practices currently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While aligning Japan’s military standards with those of its allies would help lower MRO costs in the long run, the process of alignment will require the investment of time, money, and effort to see these long-term rewards come to fruition. Achieving more aligned process standards for cross-national certification will require investment and close collaboration with the OEMs for all aircraft on which MRO is needed. These costs require careful navigation, as Japan has been successfully manufacturing for its domestic needs for decades. Scaling up to become a global service provider will necessitate collaboration and communication from all involved, which can be complicated by the necessity of navigating the differing interests of many stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another technical barrier is the misalignment of industrial practices between firms in Japan and the United States. In conversations held by CSIS in February 2025, U.S. industry representatives noted the occasional mismatch in manufacturing and quality control processes between their companies and their Japanese partners. They explained that although many Japanese facilities were highly advanced, other facilities used significant amounts of manual labor and craftsmanship when finishing products, in contrast to the machinery and automation used in the United States to ensure quality standards. One U.S. industry partner recognized the legacy of the Japanese industrial base as a potential cause of this lack of automation, noting that the Japanese defense aviation industry has less incentive to invest in machinery because it has historically serviced a limited fleet and solely focused on meeting the needs of the JASDF, its only customer. U.S. industry representatives said investments in machinery and automation are needed for Japanese facilities to receive quality certifications from them, as well as to increase efficiency and lower costs as Japanese industry looks to scale production to meet external demand. Many U.S. and Japanese industry representatives stressed that the overall level of performance and automation of Japanese industry is high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-barriers&quot;&gt;Economic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD’s investment of $10 billion toward bolstering fighter jet operations in Japan, as outlined in the strategic barriers section above, has led to increased demand for Japanese MRO capabilities. However, in surveys conducted by CSIS, Japanese manufacturing industry leaders highlighted capacity constraints as a principal challenge to scaling MRO operations to meet demand surrounding foreign military aircraft, citing the presence of shortages in both facility space and human capital. In addition to the lack of hangar space in which MRO could be performed, limited defense industrial capacity also means that Japan has fewer weapons and parts depots, shallower existing pools of spare parts, reduced ability to quickly manufacture parts, and fewer additional skilled workers who could be mobilized to work on aircraft MRO should demand surge in the event of a contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of the Japanese defense industry also means that Japan does not have a government-owned and operated defense industrial base; and private capacity can only expand through MOD contracts. Japanese companies will remain stagnant without demand signals or contract guarantees to invest in the expansion of their industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contraction of Japan’s domestic defense industry has contributed to strains on capacity. The fact that the JSDF has historically been the only customer for the defense industry has created low profit margins compared to those of U.S. and EU defense companies and has led to hesitancy to invest in new equipment and facilities. More than 100 companies have exited the defense market in the last 20 years due to this challenging landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 4, generated from Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) data, shows that Japanese companies that participate in the defense industry received a smaller share of their overall revenue from their defense units than most defense-involved firms in the United States. This diversifies their revenue streams but also means that some economies of scale and specialization returns are missed by Japanese conglomerates, which may make it hard for these firms to compete as they enter the global marketplace. However, as elaborated upon later in the section on enablers, these companies’ commercial divisions offer opportunities to expand their capacity to meet military needs by leveraging nonmilitary practices and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-industry-and-government-challenges&quot;&gt;U.S. Industry and Government Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government faces a range of challenges in conducting MRO in the Indo-Pacific, including regulatory discrepancies and insufficient demand signals to industry partners. Many of these challenges stem from inefficient bureaucratic processes that were established under a different threat landscape and do not match today’s geopolitical environment. U.S. government and industry challenges can be sorted according to the Moroney Framework OF barriers to cooperation, outlined in Table 1 in the previous section, with slight variations to reflect the different challenges on the U.S. side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;budgetary-and-economic-barriers&quot;&gt;Budgetary and Economic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a clear demand signal, neither U.S. nor Japanese industry will have a strong business case to allocate resources to the expansion of MRO capacity and capability on U.S. platforms in Japan, and much-needed capital improvements will not occur. William A. LaPlante, former U.S. undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, stated in 2023 that steady demand signals from government to industry is a requirement for ensuring resiliency. In an interview with CSIS in February 2025, U.S. industry representatives called for more funded demand in the form of requests for information (RFIs) and other contracts with dollar amounts attached. One representative said that although real demand in the region is growing due to increasing challenges, business plans are only based on funded demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary cost challenge is the allocation of responsibility for the investment needed to build up Japanese defense industrial capabilities, with clarity needed on whether industry or government will take the lead—and shoulder the financial burden. If the United States wants to use Japan for engine parts, for example, thousands of parts will need to be certified, requiring time and money. Both U.S. and Japanese industry have expressed concern over who is to bear the responsibility of investment and whether the U.S. government would help; both have also raised questions about what guarantees of future demand and contracts the U.S. government would be able to give Japanese industry if the private sector assumes responsibility for making investments in capability. Without assurances of future returns, it is difficult for industry to justify taking on the risk of expensive capacity improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workforce issues are also a challenge for the United States. In 2023, the USAF was short 1,800 maintainers, though the shortage had shrunk to 500 by May 2024. Despite this improvement, the shortage has already begun taking a toll on the workforce and was possibly a contributing factor to the number of maintenance mishaps hitting a peak of 21 in FY 2023, almost double the amount in FY 2022. Among the most consequential of these was an incorrect installation of pins that had the potential to cause vertical stabilizers to fall off of aircraft; this mistake resulted in hundreds of air refueling and recon jets being grounded in early 2023. According to Senior Master Sergeant Joshua Morales, a USAF crew chief with over 15 years of aircraft maintenance experience, “The implications [of such mishaps] extend beyond flight delays to the possibility of compromised missions and military defeat—especially in a prolonged conflict where keeping aircraft flying will be a constant challenge.” While an overstretched workforce is not necessarily the root cause of the FY 2023 maintenance issues (which remains debated), providing a new pool of labor to supplement maintenance efforts could reduce the burden on the existing workforce. Although incorporating new workflows takes time and investment in the short term, supplementing the U.S. MRO workforce with Japanese personnel could alleviate some of these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-barriers&quot;&gt;Strategic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unique environmental challenges in the Indo-Pacific region make in-theater maintenance of military equipment critical to effective deterrence and readiness. Humidity and exposure to salt water from the Pacific Ocean increases the rate of corrosion on aircraft and ground equipment, which could compromise flight safety if left undetected. Over time, these factors can have a compounding effect on DOD operations in the region and will require an approach that leverages multiple agencies to remedy challenges to U.S. basing initiatives and security efforts. In an interview conducted by CSIS on March 18, 2025, a U.S. industry representative said that material corrosion is a key problem faced during modifications. In many cases, customers who perform MRO on their own planes are unable to address severe corrosion, causing them to stop work until OEM engineers are deployed to work on the aircraft. In-theater corrosion maintenance capabilities are an essential part of deterrence in the Indo-Pacific that can be best achieved through partnerships with allies. A step in the right direction is the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, which includes a $132 million request for a Kadena Air Base Theater Aircraft Corrosion Control Center, which would enable critical corrosion control maintenance of large-body aircraft in an environmentally challenging theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States may benefit from assessing how to modify existing sustainment training and equipment for the Indo-Pacific environment. Training exercises in the Indo-Pacific have revealed that personnel challenges are a particularly difficult aspect of sustainment operations in the region. Exercises in the Philippines have identified that coordinating and integrating sustainment assets, assessing how environmental factors affect the resupply of resources, and determining how weather impacts water consumption are important considerations. Additionally, exercises in the region conducted alongside U.S. allies have revealed shortcomings in communication and coordination between forces and commanders, movement and tracking of equipment, and the availability of vehicle mechanics in the field. These challenges often occur simultaneously, triggering a chain reaction of disharmony in sustainment operations as, for example, a broken vehicle leads to delays that affect coordination and communication. Conducting similar exercises in Japan may provide further insights into sustainment challenges on the island and in the conduct of joint operations with Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bureaucratic-barriers-1&quot;&gt;Bureaucratic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lack of sustainment analysis by the USAF has made it more challenging to assess the health and readiness of aircraft fleets. Sustainment reviews help military departments estimate the cost of platform life cycles, identify budget shortfalls, and analyze the most cost-effective sources of repairs and maintenance. Despite the U.S. government’s description of sustainment as “a critical tool to assess performance and help increase readiness throughout an aircraft’s lifecycle,” neither the USAF nor Navy have yet completed their required reviews. Similar to the F-35, the F-22 program has high sustainment costs—around $13.6 billion a year. For this reason, the services’ lack of sustainment analyses hinders the DOD’s ability to clearly identify its sustainment needs, which in turn hampers efforts to predict and communicate future demand for MRO operations in the Indo-Pacific. The lack of reviews also limits the degree to which the USAF can assess how to conduct sustainment practices effectively, which impacts conversations on how to leverage Japanese capability and capacity for U.S. sustainment efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cultural-and-political-barriers-1&quot;&gt;Cultural and Political Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultural and political challenges were not reported by interviewees as major barriers to cooperation between U.S. and Japanese industry on joint MRO work. One cultural challenge that affects U.S. security cooperation with many allies and partners is U.S. contracting officers’ preference for U.S.-owned firms. This bias is reinforced by the additional bureaucratic difficulties of signing a contract with a foreign firm. These effects combine to discourage the security cooperation workforce from engaging with allied industry, even when superior officers and policy directives favor cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultural and political problems can also reduce the efficacy of potential enablers like Reciprocal Defense Procurement Memorandums of Understanding (RDP MOUs). These are agreements between the United States and foreign countries to waive “Buy American” requirements and facilitate defense trade. In a survey conducted by CSIS in 2024, allies and partners who have RDP MOUs (a group that includes Japan) noted that the existence of this exemption is not well recognized in some U.S. program offices. Additionally, respondents generally agreed that Congress and the executive branch seemed to oppose the exemptions, focusing on protecting domestic industry and making RDP MOUs less effective than originally perceived. These factors complicate the use of RDP MOUs and generate frustration among allies and partners, demonstrating that just because there are certain exemptions in place, these are not necessarily effective in bypassing bureaucratic or regulatory hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regulatory-and-technical-barriers&quot;&gt;Regulatory and Technical Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulations that restrict the export and sharing of technical information and advanced technology hinder the competitiveness of U.S. industry while simultaneously placing a significant burden on allies who try to cooperate with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these costs have been attributed particularly to ITAR and the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. As highlighted in multiple surveys and events, Japanese industry has noted that reliance on imports of ITAR-restricted parts is time sensitive and costly. The United States uses ITAR to ensure that U.S. military technology is not transferred to unfriendly actors; although limiting access to critical technologies and military capabilities is essential to maintaining a technological advantage, ITAR delays and sometimes obstructs the sharing of technical data with allies and partners. Participants in U.S. and foreign industry often point to ITAR as a barrier to cooperation, and one Japanese firm noted that relying on imports of ITAR-restricted components for MRO activities sometimes hinders their operations. However, during a roundtable discussion hosted by CSIS in January 2025, a State Department official claimed that ITAR works quickly in processing licenses and is not a barrier to exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another obstacle that the United States will have to overcome is information disclosure. One form is overclassification, which presents a barrier for integration with U.S. allies. As stated by the DOD’s Defense Innovation Board, the department “continue[s] to overclassify information, defaulting to ‘no foreign dissemination (NOFORN)’ protocols, and even fail[s] to develop suitable processes for communicating ‘controlled unclassified information (CUI)’ in today’s shared threat environment.” Consequently, U.S. government agencies are hindered in their ability to communicate with partner organizations in Japan to better collaborate on efforts like MRO cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information disclosure not only presents a challenge for intergovernmental sharing efforts but also harms industry capability. Japanese industry representatives communicated to CSIS that a firm’s ability to perform heavy or depot-level MRO on U.S. aircraft is contingent on information disclosure from the U.S. government and its industry. The Japanese firms particularly emphasized the need to ease or simplify procedures for the provision of technical information (including manuals and drawings) on defense equipment from OEMs. In a CSIS survey conducted in January 2025, Japanese companies noted barriers to receiving technical information from U.S. industry, pointing to hindrances associated with security clearances, visas (for work outside of Japan), and cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges often arise from differences in how the United States and Japan set requirements, as even minor variances can cause issues. For example, license agreements for the use of U.S. components can require extensive levels of certification, which can be a challenge for Japanese industry actors, who have expressed interest in receiving waivers to streamline MRO cooperation. Required certifications for the repair or fabrication of specific parts and for the use of Japanese maintenance facilities can also be barriers, as U.S. standards for these certifications are not always in alignment with Japanese requirements. Complying with a new set of requirements imposes costs on Japanese firms and leads to delays. These challenges can hinder the United States’ ability to conduct MRO operations in Japan and restricts both nations’ use of otherwise compatible parts and processes. In addition to licensing issues, a U.S. prime contractor told CSIS that navigating IP protections is also a difficulty that can be overcome with enough time, highlighting the importance of preparing IP export pathways prior to a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compliance with cybersecurity requirements such as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program and the Technology Security and Foreign Disclosure process are other common challenges for U.S.-Japan industry collaboration. As a U.S. industry official highlighted in an interview with CSIS, “CMMC is an issue across the board. Cyber and security concerns come up every time we talk about Japan, more than in business case issues.” The Defense Security and Cooperation Agency has tried to address these challenges by implementing “changes to improve the DOD’s understanding of international military requirements, provide allies and partners with more relevant priority capabilities, and incorporate these requirements into DOD plans to expand defense industrial base production capacity.” However, interviewees noted that these issues continue to persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, certain U.S. maintenance and sustainment requirements make it difficult for U.S. agencies to embrace defense industrial integration and collaborate on MRO efforts with Japan. One example is U.S. Code 2466, which mandates that not more than 50 percent of the funding for depot maintenance in a fiscal year may be used to contract for performance of depot maintenance and that 50 percent or more of the workload must be performed in a DOD organic depot maintenance facility by U.S. government employees. This rule limits the amount of MRO work the government can allocate to commercial or foreign entities and increases competition for work by those companies. The “50/50” statute also incentivizes the use of internal resources for platforms with higher security and technological sensitivity, posing potential challenges for MRO cooperation with U.S. allies and the expansion of joint MRO efforts overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enablers-of-japanese-industry-participation-in-mro&quot;&gt;Enablers of Japanese Industry Participation in MRO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaborating on MRO for USAF aircraft is mutually beneficial for Japan, the United States, and their respective defense industries. For the DOD and USAF, an integrated sustainment approach can enhance readiness, resilience, and capability for the U.S. Joint Force and its partners, as well as contribute to other strategic goals. On the economic front, the U.S. government can also leverage this partnership to mitigate workforce shortages, decrease cost of transit for parts and aircraft, and strengthen supply chain resilience. Integrated sustainment presents Japanese industry with the opportunity to enhance its industrial capabilities and capacity. MRO cooperation may also bolster the resiliency of U.S. industry supply chains by certifying and integrating Japanese firms. Beyond providing significant opportunities for economic growth and strengthening Japan’s defense industrial base, collaboration on MRO can also provide the Japanese government with a unique opportunity to strengthen its relationship with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-enablers-existing-infrastructure-and-relationships&quot;&gt;Economic Enablers: Existing Infrastructure and Relationships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two main enablers of Japanese industry participation in MRO processes are the current infrastructure present in Japan and the existing relationships between U.S. and Japanese industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USAF and its partners in Japanese industry can build on existing infrastructure, such as Support Center Pacific (SCP), to enable them to leverage MRO capability that is already in place. The SCP has been an “integral support unit for Department of Defense services and allied forces in the Indo-Pacific,” with operations encompassing more than 125 different aircraft components, providing a foundation for expansion of capacity and capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the SCP’s high degree of capability, its limited capacity means that 95 percent of systems still require transportation back to the United States for maintenance. By expanding and improving facilities like the SCP and Kadena Air Base, along with their working relationships with the JSDF and Japanese industry, both the U.S. and Japanese governments can capitalize on existing expertise and effective MRO operations without added costs for training and relocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s MOD has recently taken steps to expand existing weapons storage facilities, requesting $148 million in FY 2024 to build 130 new ammunition depots by 2035. Many of these depots will store long-range missiles, which require larger facilities than are currently available in most cases. Building new storage facilities for these weapons aligns with former Prime Minister Kishida Fumio’s pivotal 2022 decision to acquire long-range strike capabilities; the initiative will include the construction of four long-range missile depots at JSDF bases in the Oita and Aomori prefectures. These depots support the storage of conflict-ready equipment and increase Japanese industry access to parts necessary for MRO, especially long lead-time parts—addressing a challenge highlighted by Japanese industry in surveys conducted by CSIS in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Japanese governments can make the most of existing relationships with Japanese subcontractors involved in joint projects by encouraging them to play a role in MRO operations. Platforms like the F-2 Fighter, Glide Phase Interceptor, and SM-3 Block IIA Missile Defense System are prime examples of existing defense industrial collaborations where additional energy could be directed toward identifying mutual areas for cooperation and joint sustainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though building these existing relationships into MRO cooperation will require time and effort—as U.S. companies help certify and integrate Japanese companies into their supply chains—the benefits to U.S. industry are clear. Cooperation could lead to new possible areas of business in Japan through new cooperative agreements with Japanese companies, either for commercial MRO or military MRO, covering both USAF planes and, possibly, JSDF aircraft. Furthermore, the USAF is the most important customer for many of the United States’ aviation-focused primes; given the USAF’s emphasis on regional sustainment, many U.S. industry firms may be motivated to join the initiative in the interest of customer relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. primes can also benefit from collaborating with Japan if Japanese firms are hired to be the low-cost subcontractors of key components—given Japan’s superior production technology in certain niche areas (especially castings)—or as second sources for stressed supply chains in U.S. primes’ other markets. As one U.S. prime noted to CSIS, “We want more capacity. Raw material and some schedule items are not as quick as we would like now. The real unlock with Japan is their raw material sources and their machining sources.” Another source of advanced capability in Japan exists in Japanese industry expertise. Japan is well known for its technological advances in fields like robotics, automation, precision engineering, aerospace manufacturing, cybersecurity, electronics, and sensor technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese commercial infrastructure includes significant production technology in advanced manufacturing and aerospace. In an interview conducted by CSIS on March 18, 2025, a U.S. industry representative noted that Japanese industry, in its commercial business, uses the same standards as the United States—standards that were, in many cases, pioneered by Japanese companies. The spokesperson said that Japanese quality for major commercial components is extremely high and that companies such as MHI and KHI have been ahead of the United States on automation for decades. In another interview conducted by CSIS on February 19, a U.S. industry representative described Japan’s commercial business as a great model for the Japanese defense sector to follow, noting that Japanese companies have been successfully and competitively exporting commercial engine parts for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the commercial branches of Japanese defense companies, nontraditional companies also present an avenue for Japanese industry participation in MRO processes, as more commercial entities enter the defense market and industrial ecosystem. This grants novel opportunities to develop relationships with new companies and stakeholders. In a public event hosted by CSIS on March 13, 2025, Lt. Gen. Leo Kosinski (who retired in 2024) encouraged the involvement of nondefense companies with advanced manufacturing and innovation advantages, such as Nikon, which recently opened an advanced manufacturing plant in Long Beach, California. Aside from large companies, “startups and VCs interested in the defense sector are steadily increasing” in Japan, according to CSIS research, since the Japanese government has continued to increase its defense spending and agencies like ATLA and METI have established initiatives to connect the JSDF with startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-and-political-enablers-institutions&quot;&gt;Strategic and Political Enablers: Institutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bilateral frameworks and institutions are currently the primary enablers of U.S.-Japanese defense industrial cooperation. Initiatives like Defense Industrial Cooperation, Acquisition, and Sustainment and the Partnership for Indo-Pacific Industrial Resilience constitute formal commitments by the United States to invest in activities in Japan and signal a commitment and desire to increase collaboration in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DICAS seeks to pinpoint avenues for advanced defense industrial cooperation. Although DICAS has a broad scope, a primary focus is the joint maintenance of U.S. ships and aircraft that are forward deployed to the Pacific using Japanese commercial facilities. The four DICAS Working Groups, comprised of representatives from the United States and Japan, will focus on ship repairs, aircraft repairs, supply chain resilience, and missile coproduction. In initial talks, DICAS working groups will identify what types of weapons to focus on and coproduce, while also determining maintenance and production timeline goals. DICAS provides an official forum for defense industrial cooperation that has already enabled effective discussions and alignment of standards between the United States and Japan—serving as a technical enabler and an essential mechanism for collaboration as the two countries seek to further integrate their MRO networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview conducted by CSIS in February 2025, a U.S. prime contractor said they might explore working with Japanese industry on future programs, and in some places codevelopment, under DICAS. The company representative said that partnering with Japan is an increasing priority and that there is an effort across the whole company to focus on such opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USAF has plans to expand the Global Enterprise Network for Universal Sustainment in the Pacific region, with proposals for further services on the C-130, F-35, and F-15EX and the addition of rapid manufacturing, composite, and mobile support. Japanese industry is well positioned to benefit from this proposed expansion, as the JASDF flies the F-35A and Japanese companies have experience supporting MRO and engine component production for F-35s. During interviews conducted by CSIS in February 2025, U.S. industry representatives emphasized the significance of procuring parts in a timely and cost-effective manner, as depot capacity becomes irrelevant without the parts necessary for MRO. Procuring and storing parts is one of the primary goals of GENUS, and expanding GENUS operations in Japan and other countries will enable MRO to be performed effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has an RDP MOU with the United States, a binding agreement that enables Japanese companies to be considered domestic sources, allowing them to pass through some bureaucratic processes that other security partners cannot. From a procurement standpoint, the principal goal of an RDP MOU is to establish a mutual commitment to not discriminate against suppliers from another country, waiving Buy American laws and removing access barriers to defense marketplaces. Historically, RDP MOUs have mostly increased the purchases of component parts from foreign suppliers for larger systems that are built by U.S. companies. This aligns with existing MRO practices on U.S. equipment in Japan, as Japanese companies are focused on supplying parts and performing maintenance on existing U.S. aircraft, not on constructing and selling whole systems to the United States. Japan’s RDP MOU enables easier transfer of components and parts between the United States and Japan that are necessary for MRO. The United States and Japan also entered into a nonbinding Security of Supply Arrangement (SOSA) in 2023—an agreement to exchange reciprocal priority support for goods and services that promote national defense. This creates a mechanism for the DOD and MOD to request expedited handling of industrial resources to resolve unanticipated supply chain disruptions in order to maintain national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional framework that enables MRO cooperation is the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA), which establishes a framework for settlement procedures for the reciprocal procurement of supplies and services between two countries’ military forces. ACSA transactions are primarily used during wartime, combined exercises, training, deployments, humanitarian or disaster relief operations, or in unforeseen circumstances. Although ACSA can be an effective tool to build capacity, proper use requires strong knowledge of the tool by U.S. forces and partner nations. Additionally, the United States cannot use ACSA transactions when an item can be obtained from U.S. commercial services, and ACSA cannot be used for routine and continual supplies of goods and services. Although these stipulations put limits on the usefulness of ACSA for joint MRO, the agreements can provide valuable logistics resources in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cultural-enablers-aligning-perceptions-of-strategic-landscape&quot;&gt;Cultural Enablers: Aligning Perceptions of Strategic Landscape&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major enabler of cooperation between the United States and Japan is the two countries’ increasingly aligned threat perception, which is driving mutual interest in national security work and helping to resolve defense industry labor shortages. Escalating tensions between Japan and its neighbors—China, North Korea, and Russia—have generated more public support for strengthening defensive capabilities. A survey conducted in 2023 by the Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper, noted that 64 percent of Japanese voters believe their country should bolster its defense capabilities, with only 10 percent in opposition. Moreover, Japanese polls indicate that 84 percent of respondents feel that Japan’s national security is under threat and 91 percent consider China a threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Younger populations are especially aware of Japan’s geopolitical situation and increasingly alert to the threat posed by China, which may expand their willingness to work on defense products. Greater popular understanding of the strategic landscape may enable both countries to better attract interest by professionals of all ages in working in the defense and national security sectors, which would help to solve current labor challenges and surge capacity labor requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;budgetary-and-regulatory-enablers-cost-savings-predictable&quot;&gt;Budgetary and Regulatory Enablers: Cost Savings, Predictable&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand, and Willingness to Invest in Defense Sending a broken platform back to the United States is expensive, and MRO closer to the point of need is a significant cost-saving opportunity. This has become increasingly important as more advanced platforms incur ever-higher sustainment costs: The F-35 program, for instance, has an estimated life-cycle cost exceeding $1.7 trillion, of which $1.3 trillion is associated with operating and sustaining the aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Japan, MRO cooperation represents an opportunity to expand the country’s defense industrial base, which can provide economies of scale beyond what the JASDF could provide. Cooperation could therefore help bring down MRO costs for the JASDF in the long run. Japan’s MRO costs reached $14 billion in FY 2023, accounting for around 30 percent of the nation’s defense spending (compared to 1990, when MRO accounted for only 10 percent of defense spending). This increase in costs is due partly to aging equipment that requires more inspections and parts replacements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another budgetary enabler is the ability of cross-national MRO work to increase reliable demand for Japanese industry. Weak demand signals from the country’s own government and limited business opportunities have proven to be a barrier for Japanese investment in the defense market, as discussed in Chapter 4. The fact that there is a larger demand signal from the DOD than from Japan’s MOD may make Japanese industry eager for the chance to work on MRO for the USAF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in the Regional Sustainment Framework (RSF), industrial base integration with allies and partners contributes to “predictable demand,” which can help defense contractors make decisions about which capabilities to invest in, and at what capacity. A former U.S. official told CSIS in 2024 that Japan’s flying of U.S. aircraft is a “good enough” demand signal to jumpstart co-sustainment efforts. Because of this, a greater degree of industrial integration between the United States and Japan can act as a key enabler for Japanese industry participation in MRO processes. Notably, a U.S. prime representative also emphasized to CSIS that the scale of the conflict that the United States is preparing for in the Indo-Pacific will also fuel the demand signal, as it will inform how much investment industry will be willing to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clear and consistent messaging from the United States is key to turning predictable demand into an enabler. Without contracts, promises of work, or economic guarantees, uncertainty over long-term demand signals from the United States will prevent Japanese industry from feeling confident in investing in capacity upgrades or workforce expansion and development. Dr. Troy Meink stated during his nomination process for secretary of the Air Force that he would request continued support from Congress to provide stable funding for clear and consistent demand signals to incentivize capital investment in the U.S. defense industrial base, which may carry over to any Japanese MRO policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third budgetary enabler is increased Japanese government spending on defense. Japan is trying spur its defense sector to become a high-growth industry through new government assistance to contractors of all sizes and by encouraging exports. Former Prime Minister Kishida Fumio led the passage of the 2023 “Act on Enhancing Defense Production and Technology Bases” to create a pool of funds to bolster defense capabilities. The law was the result of three strategic documents released in December 2022 and is a major part of the Defense Buildup Program, which aims to spend $305 billion through FY 2027 to support Japan’s defense industrial base and ensure the country’s security. The act recognizes the major challenges facing Japan’s defense industry and provides numerous initiatives aimed at ensuring stable manufacturing of defense equipment. To address supply chain resiliency, the law requires Japanese defense manufacturers to shift import sources of raw materials to lower risk countries, maintain stockpiles of raw materials, and increase production of domestic raw materials and substitute products, among other efforts. To improve manufacturing efficiency, the law requires defense manufacturers to introduce advanced technologies in their processes, such as automation, AI, and digital transformation. The law also includes new requirements for cybersecurity enhancement of defense companies, citing the importance of trust in the relationship between ally countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the law provides for grants to be awarded to defense companies who export or transfer their equipment to foreign governments. These grants are not limited to just prime contractors but also cover suppliers that play partial roles in the finished products. To enable these transfers, the government will award grants to cover the costs of changing designs and modifying specifications required for export. These grants also feature an important safety net: Even if the equipment transfer in an international competitive bid is not realized, the company that receives the grant will not be expected to return any funds they have already spent. The law also aims to promote new entrants into the defense industry, improve predictability for companies in defense, and reduce the risks of investment for defense companies. The Japanese government’s commitment to increasing international defense exports and cooperation through joint public and private efforts has been signaled through diplomacy and legal change, and is now backed up by real investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technical-enablers-compatibility-of-existing-parts--embrace-of-common-standards&quot;&gt;Technical Enablers: Compatibility of Existing Parts &amp;amp; Embrace of Common Standards&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A primary enabler of joint MRO in Japan is the compatibility of parts and components between some U.S. and Japanese aircraft, along with the ongoing embrace of shared standards by the Japanese government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout CSIS’s research, roundtable events, and interviews, government and industry representatives from both the United States and Japan encouraged the idea that collaboration should begin with parts and aircraft that the two countries have in common. Similar systems and components enable joint MRO because the machinery, technology, and expertise needed to perform such maintenance is shared regardless of the ownership of the equipment. During an interview conducted by CSIS on February 28, 2025, a U.S. industry spokesperson stated that the United States and Japan should identify common parts in foreign and domestic versions of the same aircraft and build a capability to repair or fabricate those parts that can be certified to U.S. standards and then applied to both platforms. The spokesperson said that Japan has the capability to service the aircraft in its fleet that have been purchased from U.S. defense contractors, and those capabilities need to be identified and certified for use on USAF planes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, differing quality and production standards can inhibit joint maintenance and export efforts. The difficulty of non-common manufacturing processes can be seen by comparing MRO on F100 and F135 engines, as explained by a U.S. prime contractor representative during an interview conducted by CSIS in February 2025. The F100 engine, which powers the F-15 and F-16, is made by Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney (P&amp;amp;W) for the USAF and manufactured by IHI for the JASDF, each following different processes and requirements. Eighty percent of the materials used by IHI to build their engines are sourced from Japan, and the engine is built following IHI quality standards and JASDF requirements, potentially complicating the use of existing Japanese MRO for JASDF planes on USAF aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the F135 engine production system that powers F-35s around the world has commonality built in from the outset. IHI has built 29 F135 engines to date in a P&amp;amp;W facility that IHI owns and operates, requiring adherence to P&amp;amp;W methods, tooling, and quality standards. This standardized quality and production system allows F135 engines produced by IHI to be interchangeable with other F-35s, regardless of the country of ownership. In CSIS’s interview, the U.S. industry spokesperson mentioned that IHI has now converted its F135 manufacturing facility into a regional depot as part of P&amp;amp;W’s regional network of maintenance facilities. P&amp;amp;W personnel staff the facility, although IHI remains the owner and operator; this could enable the facility to play a key role in sustaining USAF F-35s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other aircraft programs such as the F-2 and F-16 offer potential areas of cooperation, despite the many differences between parts and processes used to manufacture the aircraft. The F-2 was a joint project between U.S. manufacturers and Mitsubishi, with around 60 percent of production taken on by Japan and 40 percent by the United States. Japanese companies made parts like the F-2’s radar, heads-up display, and inertial navigation system. The F-2 is used exclusively by the JASDF and was modeled on the General Dynamics F-16, with an engine derived from licensed production of the General Electric F110, also used in the F-16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government still must determine the demand rate for these parts before proceeding with a request for work from Japanese industry. U.S. industry is also waiting for resources from the U.S. government to analyze their investments and potential relationships with Japanese industry. The U.S. government has flexible contracting options that could fit this need, delivering funding to industry to accelerate the evaluation of cooperation avenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government’s commitment to aligning its domestic equipment standards to those of the United States and Europe is one of the strongest enablers of enhanced MRO cooperation. As mentioned earlier, the JSDF has historically adhered to its own unique standards, complicating the exchange of parts and components. In 2023, the Japanese government issued draft guidelines outlining plans to sync its standards for domestically produced defense equipment with those of the United States and Europe to reduce maintenance costs and increase business opportunities for Japanese industry. The new guidelines state that defense supply chains should complement those of allies and partners, encouraging lower prices, increasing domestic production opportunities, and ensuring continuous operability of all equipment. These new requirements also include subsidies for small- and medium-sized manufacturers that supply parts to larger contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2024 Defense of Japan report, the Japanese government outlined a focus on “improvement in mutual interchangeability” of defense equipment to ensure interoperability with the United States. Modular defense equipment can be interfaced across major systems from independent vendors, designed with an architecture in which systems use common standards to ensure interoperability. One strategy for building this adaptable system is called the Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA), the DOD’s preferred method of implementation for open systems that is required for most major defense acquisition programs. MOSA is particularly useful for integrating technology within systems so that subsystems made by different companies can “talk” to each other. Standardization would allow the United States and Japan, along with other allies and partners, to include subsystems produced by different vendors in standard interfaces that integrate and operate together, enabling joint operations. For Japanese industry, building MOSA-compliant systems or components would increase foreign demand for products and allow companies to take full advantage of Japan’s recently loosened export laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-Japan alliance stands at a critical turning point amid growing threats in the Indo-Pacific. By focusing on collaborative aircraft MRO, both nations could enhance their credible deterrence capabilities by addressing strategic challenges of distance and signaling a long-term commitment to regional security. This report has underscored the difficulties both countries face in maintaining a defense industrial ecosystem that will be resilient in the face of contested logistics, as well as highlighted the strong foundations for a possible expansion of Japan’s role in the maintenance of USAF assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress is being made in solving the sustainment challenge faced by the USAF in the Indo-Pacific, but barriers to collaboration still exist. Stringent U.S. export regulations and IP laws prevent the sharing of some technical information essential to MRO, complicating the ability of Japanese industry to perform maintenance on U.S. aircraft. The United States and Japan, along with U.S. and Japanese companies, are unsure of who will bear the cost burden of investing in new capabilities and expanded capacity. Without clarity, further progress is difficult. Though the Japanese government is building a more modern approach to defense production, remaining cultural and bureaucratic challenges continue to slow down the transfer of knowledge, labor, and capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the United States and Japan have taken steps, both separately and together, to advance defense industrial cooperation and overcome barriers. Japanese companies already perform MRO on numerous U.S. military platforms and have experience partnering with U.S. OEMs on maintenance and joint development. The Japanese government has prioritized investments in its defense industrial base and has arranged its export laws to enhance defense collaboration, demonstrating its commitment to expanding defense posture and industry. The United States, for its part, has established multiple dialogues and frameworks dedicated to partnering with Japan and exploring sustainment solutions in the Indo-Pacific, providing new avenues for official communication and cooperation. Success hinges not only on strategic alignment but also on practical measures to streamline cooperation and overcome hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following recommendations identify how the United States and Japan could further accelerate cooperation to meet the urgent strategic imperative of overcoming challenges regarding MRO capacity and contested logistics in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and Japan should consider expanding on, not replacing, the physical and diplomatic infrastructure that is already in place.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;a. Establishments like the SCP, Kadena Air Base, and Japanese facilities in surrounding areas provide significant capability for MRO work, and further investments could be made to grow this capacity. Expanding on existing locations would make it easier to engage with local communities who have adapted to U.S. military presence and have experience working alongside U.S. service members and their families.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;b. If both nations seek continuity and an expansion of current cooperation efforts, dialogue frameworks such as DICAS should be maintained and supported. The DICAS framework has been agreed upon by both the United States and Japan, and officials from both sides have already begun working within the framework. Additionally, U.S. and Japanese industry have begun taking DICAS into account in their business plans and have said that DICAS offers a positive demand signal for future MRO business in Japan. The United States should consider continuing to devote resources to strengthening these facilities and relationships, accelerating progress toward overcoming MRO cooperation challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To increase MRO capacity for USAF aircraft in Japan, the two countries will likely need to either pay—fully or in part—for the expansion of facilities, certification, and alignment of standards, or offer contract guarantees to companies who make their own investments. Both nations’ governments and industries will need to determine who will pay for investments in infrastructure. U.S. and Japanese companies have emphasized that they will not invest in expansions of facilities, certifications, or standard alignments without some guarantee of a return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should provide clearer and more consistent demand signals to U.S. and Japanese industry by estimating how much Japan-based MRO support it will need. While estimating future demand is difficult, industry cannot right-size any investment in the capabilities necessary to meet future USAF demand in Japan without knowing roughly what the demand level will be.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should consider making use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) to quickly support U.S. companies, encouraging them to explore areas of collaboration and develop relationships with Japanese companies. The U.S. government could also identify business opportunities for U.S. industry in Japan based on existing domestic capabilities and capacity in MRO—especially opportunities to catalyze partnerships between U.S. and Japanese industry. Timeliness is essential in joint MRO due to the strategic urgency of maintaining and strengthening deterrence in the Indo-Pacific region, and OTA agreements provide a faster method of providing funding to U.S. industry than traditional contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Japanese governments should identify common aircraft, components, and parts and build strategies for MRO collaboration. Though U.S. and Japanese models differ at times in specific materials and manufacturing processes, their shared elements can be built upon to create the capability to service both models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both nations’ governments and industries should consider increasing alignment of manufacturing and quality control standards to enhance the ability of Japanese companies to plug into U.S. supply chains. The Japanese government should continue to fund or increase funding to its Basic Policy on Enhancing Defense Production and Technology Bases, which provides support for defense companies looking to enhance their manufacturing processes and cybersecurity, among other things. U.S. companies should work with Japanese industry toward mutual acceptance of standards and should be flexible in accepting some processes that are common practice in Japan, without sacrificing airworthiness or quality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and Japan could benefit from embracing modular designs and common standards in their future acquisition programs, especially for any joint acquisitions. Coproduction in future programs should ensure that quality standards and processes are aligned from the beginning to enable closer collaboration. MOSA is the gold standard for modularity, and if both the USAF and JASDF make use of modular concepts in procurements, joint MRO of future shared systems would be much easier to realize.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japanese companies could benefit from leveraging their commercial assets and practices for military MRO. U.S. aerospace firms have praised Japan’s commercial aerospace industry, saying the country has pioneered quality standards and is aligned with the United States on advanced production methods and certifications, while still lagging on the military side of the aviation sector. Inter-business managerial transfers or sharing within companies that have successful commercial aviation business units could help transfer knowledge and best practices to defense aerospace business units. Automation and quality standards, as well as commercial best-in-class facilities, should be applied to the defense side of production, potentially including any investment in dedicated defense facilities needed to reach the same level of excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and Japan could conduct a wargame, exercise, or other simulation with Japanese forces to evaluate current sustainment capabilities and gaps. Performing a tabletop exercise of a realistic contested logistics scenario would help identify bottlenecks and other factors that could complicate the maintenance of an operable aircraft fleet in the event of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Yet it lacks tools to predict the accuracy and robustness of the algorithms powering such capabilities, risking both military effectiveness and law-of-war compliance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology of artificial intelligence (AI) is remarkable, while sometimes being remarkably fragile. AI principally has been applied in a small number of substantive domains, and its implications for other domains—particularly war—remain poorly understood despite being incredibly consequential. The Department of Defense (DOD) does not appear to be developing the analytical tools needed to assess systematically, much less predict, the accuracy of AI-enabled military capabilities; neither is it methodically developing the operational concepts needed to effectively incorporate AI into war. This need, however, is urgent: The United States is confronting the rise of a peer competitor, as well as a host of other military dangers and problems. China fields precision guided munitions, hypersonic missiles, and fighter aircraft increasingly able to pierce U.S. air superiority, capabilities that pose risks to classic U.S. power projection forces. There is a reasonable basis to believe that AI-enabled military capabilities could help rectify many deficiencies in U.S. combat power. This outcome assumes, however, that the effects of the AI algorithms in sensitive uses could be confidently anticipated, an assumption that the DOD cannot currently make. This paper demonstrates the importance of the DOD developing analytical tools to inform decisions about the use of algorithms, particularly in the context of sensitive applications like sensor and firing networks. It then provides recommendations on how the DOD should proceed to develop such analytical tools and the operational concepts to effectively employ and defend against AI-enabled military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;context&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“With the correctness of their science, history had no right to meddle, since their science now lay in a plane where scarcely one or two hundred minds in the world could follow its mathematical processes; but bombs educate vigorously…”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-henry-adams-1918&quot;&gt;— Henry Adams, 1918&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence is a remarkable technology, but it is vulnerable to errors, even in domains where it has long been used. The prospect of the use of AI in war raises acute concerns about the occurrence of errors and their consequences. Absent the ability to predict the effects of AI-enabled military capabilities, the United States could neither confidently nor responsibly rely on the deterrence or warfighting benefits of these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet these benefits are urgently needed. The U.S. ability to deter war in regions of critical interest is fading. Adversaries—particularly China—have improved their own capabilities and could now threaten classic U.S. power projection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD should develop analytical tools to measure, manage, and predict the accuracy of algorithms. Many individuals—from both inside and outside of the DOD—have called in general terms for such techniques to be developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI-enabled military capabilities, particularly sensor and firing networks, combined with other force and program improvements, would be among the most promising strategies for shoring up deterrence and defense capabilities in the near- and mid-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presently, the DOD does not appear to be developing a systematic set of analytical tools for this purpose. There is no indication that there are department-wide metrics that could inform important decisions at any of the necessary analytical levels—in the field, in the command center and the Situation Room, or in wargames. Individual programs sometimes have excellent program-specific metrics, but this isolated data cannot solve broader problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department has thus far framed its guidance for the development and use of AI-enabled military capabilities in a general fashion, calling for capabilities that are “responsible, equitable, traceable, reliable, and governable.” These general qualities, while worthy, are far from enough. Predictions about the effects of AI-enabled capabilities, particularly for sensitive uses, would need a high degree of confidence to inform decisions in the command center or the Situation Room regarding military effectiveness and law of war compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence could power meaningful improvements in warfighting capabilities, assuming its effects could be accurately predicted. The DOD, though, cannot make this assumption today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catalyzing military innovation in peacetime is very difficult. The vigorous education provided by war swiftly provides lessons about effective ways to incorporate emerging technologies. But these lessons are too often provided by the adversary, and war is invariably a harsh teacher—meting out insights with a clarity that yields an education, but one tinged with regret and loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful peacetime innovation would need to resolve interlocking puzzles confronting the United States at this strategic and technological moment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI has thus far been vulnerable to errors in the domains where it is used. These errors are likely to appear—perhaps more often and with more consequence—when it is transplanted into a new substantive domain such as war. DOD needs analytical tools to assure accuracy of uses in the field. There has been limited work, both generally and within the DOD specifically, to systematically identify, understand, and mitigate these errors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If AI is to be used in war, decisions in the command center or the Situation Room would need to rely on predictions about the effects of the use of algorithms, particularly in sensitive applications. Absent such predictive tools, AI-enabled military capabilities could not be responsibly authorized in uses such as a sensor and firing network (discussed further below). DOD efforts are not on a trajectory to develop the analytical tools required to predict the effects of sensitive combat decisions made by AI, either in terms of military effectiveness or compliance with the law of war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Changes in the threats confronting the United States—including the emergence of China as a peer competitor—mean that classic U.S. defense capabilities including power projection are at risk. The fielding of AI-enabled capabilities, including in sensor and firing networks, could be a significant contribution to efforts to manage and reduce emerging threats. Adversaries have incorporated new technologies and could complicate, if not defeat, U.S. efforts in some key theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historically, new technologies only win wars if they are incorporated into new operational concepts. The DOD does not have a methodical effort underway to develop, vet, and implement new operational concepts using emerging technologies. Identifying and developing effective operational concepts is conceptually difficult, relying as it does on an accurate idea about the nature of future war. Implementing promising new operational concepts is bureaucratically difficult, given their inevitable effect of reducing the importance of some existing weapons systems and their associated professional communities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOD needs to make significant reforms to strengthen its ability to effectively incorporate emerging technologies. Making such reforms would be difficult in the best of times, and these are not the best of times. It is, however, urgent to strengthen deterrence and defense capabilities, including through responsibly incorporating AI-enabled technologies and building defenses against an adversary’s use of them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Realists, liberals, and humanitarians are the traditional parties in the argument about the cause and effect of war. Realists want the warfighting advantages of precision and speed putatively offered by AI. Liberals and humanitarians are skeptical about the claims of precision and troubled by the prospect of speed. Liberals fear that speed increases the risk of unwanted escalation; humanitarians fear that autonomous firing decisions will have speed but lack precision—much less common decency—and hence oppose such firing decisions. The speed celebrated by realists, though, is largely acquired through the autonomous targeting and firing decisions. Analytical tools for accuracy and robustness are necessary to responsibly reconcile the key insights of these views, even if they cannot fully resolve their differences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report focuses on AI incorporated into conventional warfighting capabilities. It does not engage directly with the implications of artificial intelligence incorporated into any element of the use of nuclear weapons. It is a reasonable assumption, though, that the report’s many concerns about the risk of mistakes for AI-enabled conventional weapons would apply with even greater consequence in AI-enabled decision processes about nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;growing-vulnerability&quot;&gt;Growing Vulnerability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. conventional forces in the post–Cold War era were configured on the idea that the United States could surge power projection forces swiftly enough to supplement forward presence forces. Working with allies and friends, these combined forces would be able to deter and, if necessary, defeat conventional military threats in regions of critical interest abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Cold War receded further into history, this basic idea of using forward presence and power projection to deter or defeat regional adversaries persisted in U.S. defense planning. The changes in the ensuing years constituted adjustments to the same basic strategy, through different combinations of adversary major and minor regional contingencies. But over time, this idea has reflected less and less the strategic realities the United States actually confronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ rivals today are vastly better than they were even a decade ago at attacking the type of forward presence and power projection forces that have been the hallmark of U.S. conventional capabilities. This is largely because adversaries—particularly China—have grown the size of their militaries, created a more favorable deployment pattern for these forces, and effectively incorporated advanced technologies. Adversaries have developed and fielded long-range precision guided missiles (PGMs) coupled with sensors that could direct these missiles effectively, as well as capable fleets of military aircraft, both fighters and bombers. China’s military in particular is much larger and more capable than it was 13 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any large aggregation of U.S. military assets would be at risk from these capabilities. Large force aggregations include aircraft carriers, ports of debarkation and embarkation, military camps and airfields, and large ground force units, all key components of forward presence and power projection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military is developing and deploying countermeasures to these precision attacks, and doubtless some of these countermeasures will be effective. While the details matter in each dyad between a weapon and its target, there is no compelling solution to the observation that these U.S. forces would be vastly more vulnerable in the future than they have been in the past. The months-long deployment to the Persian Gulf that the United States pursued in 1991, for example, would no longer be possible today if competitors wanted to threaten it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adversaries also tend to be located closer than the United States to the contested theaters. This difference complicates for the United States the challenge presented by geography to power projection forces and their resupply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such situations, U.S. power projection forces would be vulnerable to attacks of various sorts en route to and upon arrival in theater; it is even increasingly likely that U.S. forces might arrive only after the conclusion of decisive battles, largely because of the harsh realities of distance and the improvements in adversary capabilities. U.S. forces could then only lament in person the changed strategic reality on the ground and the unhappy choices now confronting the United States and its friends and allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple changes that need to be made to make the power projection element of this strategy plausible again. Those changes should incorporate a large sensor and firing network that could detect an adversary (“red”) attack on critical interests abroad and then allocate and fire U.S. or allied (“blue”) weapons against those attacking forces. Much larger stockpiles of precision guided munitions would be needed, along with other reforms to U.S. forces, both forward deployed and reinforcing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of broad strategy—destroying a red attack against blue allies through the rapid and integrated firing of precision-guided munitions to halt the initial invasion—is an important part of the most promising available strategy in the near- and mid-term. It would require the creation of an effective and very large—likely theater-wide—sensor and firing network. In at least some types of crises, this network would need to have a certain degree of autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes could help manage the greater pressure on U.S power projection forces. A sensing and firing network seems necessary, along with other force adjustments and the efforts of friends and allies, to deter—or, if necessary, defend—Taiwan from an attack from China, the eastern border of NATO from an attack by Russia, or other missions in distant theaters. Absent these capabilities and other improvements, respected defense analysts warn that Chinese or Russian attacks could be successful. It is this growing vulnerability that provides the urgency to swiftly and effectively incorporate AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report acknowledges that there is a great debate within the United States today over whether there should be a fundamental redefinition of its strategic interests. The substantive resolution of this debate is difficult to predict. Whatever the outcome, the complicated issues of AI-enabled military capabilities, particularly sensitive uses like a sensor and firing network, are not going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if the United States decided that only the security of its territorial borders was critical, the risk of adversary precision guided munitions of various sorts attacking the homeland would remain. A defensive effort—whatever its precise characteristics or configuration—should involve AI-enabled military capabilities, particularly an AI-enabled sensor and firing network constructed to move swiftly to identify and destroy the incoming missiles and other weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;crucible-for-reform&quot;&gt;Crucible For Reform&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report agrees with the assessment that broader reforms are needed in the Pentagon to strengthen its ability to incorporate emerging technology. There is not, however, time to wait until the DOD’s internal structure and processes are fixed. Comprehensive efforts to incorporate AI responsibly need to move forward more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable that more rapid progress, this report recommends that the secretary of defense empower select senior warfighters to develop operational concepts for the use of AI-enabled military capabilities, largely freed from many of the bureaucratic constraints hobbling current progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These senior warfighters would be a select group of the combatant commanders including at least those from Special Operations Command, Indo-Pacific Command, and European Command. They would get new authorities for funding, staffing, and reinterpreting regulations for these capabilities. They would have the funding and acquisition authority for AI, related communications, and small platforms, including drones. This funding authority would create a much more dynamic ability to select solutions from different suppliers, including the Defense Innovation Unit, tech startups, the military services, and traditional defense contractors. The new operational concepts and capabilities would be thoroughly tested in well-instrumented wargames. At the end of a two- to four-year period of experimentation, the secretary could decide whether to let the select combatant commanders retain their new funding and acquisition authority or to relocate that authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report also recommends that the secretary create a competitive dynamic for the first few years on the development of analytical tools, directing the select combatant commanders and a reorganized Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) to each develop tools. After a few years of competitive effort, the secretary should select the suite of tools most useful for the purpose and consolidate the approaches used for analysis within the DOD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDAO should be supplemented with expertise in warfighting and analysis or a new organization with analytical expertise in both warfighting and AI should be created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the secretary should ensure that JASON, the advisory group consisting of top national scientific experts who advise the national security community on sensitive technical questions, has elite academic experts on artificial intelligence. This perspective is vitally important given the remarkable and unexpected advances that AI technology continues to make. The advice of these outside experts is often revelatory and influential, although it is rarely celebrated in its initial presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proposal is developed further in Appendix II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sensing-and-firing-networks&quot;&gt;Sensing and Firing Networks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War has a small number of recurring objectives. One of these is locating a red target and destroying it with a blue weapon. A military archer sees an attacking enemy soldier and aims an arrow. A single drone uses an image recognition algorithm, identifies a red target with required accuracy, and then detonates the blue payload of explosives an optimal distance from the target. These are very different missions, but the fundamental tasks of locating and destroying remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A “sensor and firing network” as discussed here would be an AI-enabled system to identify and characterize red targets, allocate blue weapons against those targets, and then launch those weapons. The scale envisioned is a battlefield or even a theater-wide engagement. There is no indication in the public literature that there is an existing network at anything approaching this scale and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a network would integrate the findings of blue sensors and information streams evaluating and characterizing hundreds or perhaps thousands of red targets, allocating blue weapons from ground, sea, and air-based assets in theater as well as long-range assets outside of the theater. It would then execute an integrated blue launch decision, either made by a human operator or pre-authorized to occur autonomously under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are examples of such networks on a smaller, more limited scale. The Israeli Iron Dome system has had remarkable success against limited attacks by shorter-range ballistic missiles through tracking incoming missiles and autonomously launching interceptor missiles to destroy those assessed to be heading toward populated areas. The Iron Dome has been reported to have a success rate of stopping 90 percent of missiles launched against its covered areas. It reportedly has a launch-to-impact speed of 15 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the current war in the Middle East grows in duration and combatants, some of the vulnerabilities of the Iron Dome and its related systems may grow in significance. The related systems seek to stop longer-range missiles, ideally further and further away from the protected areas. The per unit cost of the interceptor missiles launched by the Iron Dome is high—with estimates ranging from $60,000 to $40,000 per missile. The cost of adversary missiles or drones being fired at Israel vary widely but often is significantly less. For example, in an exchange, Hezbollah missiles were largely stopped by Israel’s Iron Dome system—a seeming validation of sophisticated high-end defensive systems. But the cost of the Iron Dome defense was 10 times that of the Hezbollah attack. The struggle may become one of capacity: Israel’s access to more interceptor missiles against adversaries’ capacity to launch yet more missiles at Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The territory covered by the Iron Dome is limited in size and so the adversary does have some incentive to find valuable targets beyond its effective range. Most importantly, at some number and rate of incoming missiles, any defensive system—including the Iron Dome—would become saturated and ineffective. Even with autonomous targeting and firing decisions, the total number of items to manage could overwhelm the capacity of a particular system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues do not invalidate the remarkable contribution that the Iron Dome has made to the security of Israel, nor the theoretical usefulness of sensor and firing networks for defensive and even warfighting purposes. They do, however, underscore again that while specification of the mission is often clear-cut—find the red target and destroy it with a blue weapon—the details matter when planning for sustained, durable success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such details would be much more demanding should the attempt be made to build a theater-wide sensing and firing network. Yet such a network could contribute in essential ways to the challenge of strengthening U.S. power projection capabilities. There is both the strategic need for such a network, and plausibly, although not yet demonstrably, the technical ability to perform these functions through the use of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the strategic need, recall the Fulda Gap, that piece of territory in Germany that divided NATO from the Warsaw Pact during the coldest days of the Cold War. On each side of the gap, large numbers of tanks, troops, air power, and assorted support capabilities looked at each other across the border. If the Warsaw Pact had decided to launch a conventional attack, any advance would have been slowed, if not stopped, by the substantial NATO forces in being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But consider a situation in which the Warsaw Pact had forces on the Fulda Gap, or perhaps a discrete distance back, and the West no longer had forces on the other side of the gap. West Germany had some military forces, but these were vastly outnumbered by the Warsaw Pact forces in being. NATO remained a stalwart ally, but each countries’ forces were largely stationed on their own territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How, then, to stop the Warsaw Pact forces if they decided to drive toward the West through the Fulda Gap? It would be vastly preferable to stop the Warsaw Pact forces before they cross into West Germany, to prevent the civilian deaths and the destruction of property that would result from an invasion and occupation. In addition, while pushing forces out of occupied territory is certainly possible, the prospect of doing so against a nuclear-armed adversary should certainly give pause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the Warsaw Pact forces started moving toward the border there would not be much time to react. Say there were about 100 miles from the Warsaw Pact barracks to the border of West Germany—roughly the distance across the strait from mainland China to Taiwan. It is not plausible to move NATO heavy forces to the Fulda Gap in the amount of time it would take the Warsaw Pact forces to move that 100 miles into West Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a sensor and firing network such as described above exists in this thought experiment, the way to stop the Warsaw Pact invasion would be to quickly identify all the Warsaw Pact tanks moving toward the border, allocate blue weapons against each tank, and launch the blue precision guided munitions. Time would be short, though, and if the invasion force is large, an AI network, possibly set on an autonomous mode, might well be the only way to perform the process quickly enough to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a network as envisioned here would have three stages. In the first phase, the network would identify, vet, and characterize red military targets. In the second phase, blue weapons would be allocated against each red target so as to maximize military effectiveness and ensure compliance with the law of war. The third phase would be the firing of the blue weapons, either by a human operator or by an algorithm consistent with rules previously programmed into it by a human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts posit that an AI-driven network would have precision and speed. Integrated networks at the size of an Israeli Iron Dome have been effective. Larger networks seem plausible, but the details matter when identifying and destroying a target and ultimately could prove intractable at scale. Whether a responsible battle-wide or theater-wide network could be constructed remains undemonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is focused on the AI elements of such a network. It is worth noting briefly that many other gaps would remain. For example, the United States would need to vastly increase its stockpile of precision guided munitions to successfully execute such a strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The call to develop analytical tools does not assume that the targeting and firing decisions in these networks would be autonomous. Careful analysis must be done in advance, to either support the human decisionmaker or to enable responsible prior authorization of autonomous firing in certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the wargames and other activities called for here, the DOD should develop new operational concepts that identify additional ideas about how to use AI to the United States’ advantage in war. Powerful use cases are emerging that involve tactical deployment of small platforms—particularly drones—in concert with other coordinated platforms operating with at least some autonomy. These uses seem very promising. The DOD should explore these uses, either to use them against an adversary or to defend against their use by an adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-need-for-analytical-tools&quot;&gt;The Need for Analytical Tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD makes decisions in the field, in the command center and the Situation Room, and in wargames. Each of these contexts requires different analytical pathways and would need to have different tools created to enable the responsible use of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decisions in the field turn on straightforward questions. Soldiers need to be able to confirm that an AI algorithm would be accurate when performing a specific function in a particular context—for instance, that an image recognition algorithm would correctly identify an adversary tank and only an adversary tank in a particular battle on a specific day. A shot needs to hit its intended target: Even the most brave and aggressive warfighters have no desire to die from fratricide if a weapon is launched at them by their own military because of fatal errors in target identification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decisions in the command center or the Situation Room require a more robust understanding of the expected effects of a military measure. This requirement is necessary to assess both military effectiveness and compliance with the law of war. For AI, these questions would need to focus on whether an algorithm that has been effective in the past would be accurate in a prospective, not yet fully specified, use on a future battlefield. The current lack of understanding of the robustness of algorithms, particularly algorithms for sensitive uses, means that neither calculation can currently be made responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accuracy and robustness in decisionmaking are needed regardless of whether these sensor and firing networks are autonomous or not. Human-authorized autonomous firing would require vastly better data than is currently available. Similarly, a human with active oversight of a sensor and firing network, sometimes called being “in the loop” or “on the loop,” would confront great complexity and extraordinary time pressure. Such oversight might not seem particularly meaningful without significantly better analytical tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report urges that any deployment of algorithms for sensitive uses, including in sensing and firing networks, should be authorized in the rules of engagement approved by the secretary of defense before a particular operation to ensure that these issues receive an appropriate degree of oversight. This would require a definition of “sensitive” use cases for algorithms, and recognition of the different requirements for accuracy and robustness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all algorithms used in military capabilities would need these high levels of accuracy and robustness. Algorithms that identify candidate items for further review could have less stringent requirements for accuracy because of the prospect of human oversight without severe time pressure. For example, there are algorithms that scan millions of hours of video imagery for items that look like improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The candidate items would then be further reviewed, including by intelligence analysts, before a definitive decision that it was an IED and thus an appropriate candidate target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report argues that generative AI should not be used for sensitive uses, including a sensor and firing network, at this stage of its development. This is because of generative AI’s vulnerability to random errors. Generative AI could be used as an aid to intelligence analysts, as long as the analysts were aware of the risks of error currently inherent in a generative AI algorithm (see the section on generative AI below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third set of decisions arises in the context of wargames. Wargames are one of the most promising techniques to develop and vet new operational concepts. Analytical tools for wargames require properly anticipating and modeling the effects of red equipment, tactics, and strategies. These interactions would be difficult to model particularly for a technology whose effects are poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI raises strategic questions that fall outside of these three contexts as well. For example, how to manage unwanted escalation—a legitimate concern, given that much of AI’s military advantage is in the posited speed of its integrated networks. There also are ethical questions surrounding any decision to permit AI algorithms to make targeting and launch decisions, particularly those that could injure an active enemy combatant or, more perilously, a noncombatant. These questions have emerged in the ongoing debate among the different perspectives on war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;realists-liberals-and-humanitarians&quot;&gt;Realists, Liberals, and Humanitarians&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realists, liberals, and humanitarians are the traditional protagonists in the effort to explain cause and effect in international relations. These three groups rarely agree, but artificial intelligence—at its broadest level—has achieved a rare consensus: that incorporating AI into war will be transformative. The protagonists disagree, though, on the nature of that transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realists emphasize the promise of AI in effective deterrence, decisive warfighting capabilities, and even defense dominance, which would vastly reduce the risk of war against status-quo powers. There is tantalizing evidence from Ukraine and Russia that these predictions are likely to be accurate. Realists concede that AI algorithms could make mistakes, but they judge that, on balance, these problems could be managed and reduced to an acceptable level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberals warn of algorithmic mistakes and unintended escalation leading to unwanted wars. Unwanted escalation occurs when neither nation-state really wants war, but both fear losing the war if the other side attacks first. Not wanting war, a nation-state may nevertheless choose to start one because it wants defeat even less. It fears that the other nation-state is likely to attack and judges that with extant military technologies at play, an attack is likely to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanitarians underscore the centrality of human life above all. Humanitarians fear that whatever the sophistication of the algorithms, unacceptable mistakes are inevitable because of the importance of understanding context in use of force decisions. Algorithms may learn to accurately judge what criteria make an actor a legitimate military target, but might be unable to grapple with complexity, for example, if the actor is a child. This group remains troubled by the prospect of any autonomous firing decisions but especially when the target is a human being, and urge constraints on the use of autonomous weapons systems (AWS) for any purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The law of war, part of a broader body of international humanitarian law, seeks to assure that war is conducted with distinction, proportionality, and humanity. The United States military is required to maintain consistency with the law of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanitarians have been seeking the adoption of additional components of the law of war to prohibit the use of AWS to target humans. These components would require “meaningful” or “effective” human control, generally defined as human involvement in the selection of the specific target (as opposed to a target being selected by an algorithm) and in the making of a firing decision (as opposed to preapproval by a commander based on some prespecified criteria).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an alternative perspective that the classic requirements for distinction, proportionality, and humanity under the law of war could lead to responsible use of AI-enabled military capabilities. Liberals and humanitarians doubt, not unreasonably, that such responsible application would in fact occur, and there is too much recent evidence in favor of their position to reject these doubts out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report concedes the vulnerability to mistakes and thus urges the development of analytical tools to minimize and manage these risks. AI-enabled military capabilities, to include algorithms to identify targets in a firing network, should not be used until such tools are developed and implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report joins many voices in the debate, including that of the U.S government, to argue that the additional prohibitions on lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs) proposed by humanitarians should not be adopted. The “meaningful” or “effective” human control requirement would eliminate much of the warfighting benefit from a posited responsible autonomous sensor and firing network, since it would slow the process considerably and perhaps enable adversary efforts to move key assets out of the effective reach of U.S. capabilities or even use them first against U.S. forces. The problematic aspects of AI-enabled weapons should be governed by the classic law of war—distinction, proportionality, and humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as with any discussion between the realists and humanitarians, there is the great difficulty of reconciling the perspective on human life at home with the perspective on the battlefield. Wars occur, and realists remind the nation-state that wars need to be deterred and, when necessary, won. Humanitarians draw attention to the enduring perplexity of conducting wars to protect a people, through the device of killing another people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An AI-enabled sensing and firing network, be it large or small, would crystallize the differences among realists, liberals, and humanitarians. The risk of technical mistakes is real in every stage of a sensor and firing network but is particularly acute in the first phase, in which the algorithm is supposed to identify legitimate military targets and only legitimate military targets consistent with military requirements and distinction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stage two is when the blue weapons are allocated against each red target as determined in the first stage. That allocation should minimize collateral damage to ensure that proportionality and humanity requirements are met. Stage three is the firing decision made either by a human operator or by an algorithm. The challenge in each stage increases proportionally as the scale of the enterprise—the number of red targets and blue weapons—increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stages two and three will be vulnerable to escalation risk because there will be military advantage to acting quickly. If war is inevitable, acting quickly to secure the resulting benefits makes sense. If there is still diplomatic hope that war could be avoided, though, acting quickly because of escalation pressures could turn a diplomatic crisis into a war wanted by neither side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stage three is where the decisions about autonomous firing decisions would play out in one of three ways: as the result of (1) real-time human control, (2) earlier considered human control, or (3) carelessness, the absence of any type of meaningful control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, technical issues of accuracy and robustness are most likely to plague efforts in the first phase, while escalation issues are most likely to plague those in the second and third, and the decisionmaking issues around appropriate firing authority are most likely to plague the third phase. (See Appendix I for further consideration of these issues.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realists, liberals, and humanitarians all agree that AI in war will be transformative. Yet the policy recommendations of these groups are irreconcilable, with their calls, respectively, for more and swifter incorporation, limits on incorporation, and a prohibition on all LAWs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytical tools for accuracy and robustness must be developed and incorporated into decisionmaking. These tools and their responsible use would demonstrate respect for these different perspectives, if not their categorical observance. Otherwise, the ongoing responsibilities of the United States in war seem impossible to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;remarkable-yet-fragile-ai-algorithms&quot;&gt;Remarkable Yet Fragile: AI Algorithms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rate of advance in artificial intelligence leaves only one key observation stable: The technology is advancing more rapidly than the policy frameworks to manage its implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many recent technical advances and policy debates have focused on large language models (LLMs), which burst into public notice in November 2022. The current boom in AI really started a decade earlier, in the 2012 ImageNet competition when the winning algorithm had half the errors of the second-place winner, achieving the greater accuracy through the technique of using neural networks, a supplement to an algorithm that significantly increases its accuracy but is voracious in terms of data and power consumption. The theories that power AI stretch back much further than 2012; the formal start of the modern era is generally dated to an AI conference held at Dartmouth in the summer of 1956. Despite the earlier articulation of many of the critical theoretical insights, the field took off in the early twenty-first century largely because two additional, essential innovations became widely available: massive datasets, thanks to the internet, and large amounts of computing power, thanks to the ongoing advances of Moore’s Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until very recently, it was true that a larger training database yielded a more accurate algorithm as long as there was no constraint on available computing power. The amount of data needed for an accurate algorithm was usually large but varied significantly depending on the type of algorithm and the complexity of the problem. AI image recognition algorithms, for instance, often used millions of images, while LLMs used billions of pieces of data acquired from millions of webpages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first cracks in this verity showed up at the outset of 2025. Advances by the Chinese company DeepSeek seem to have demonstrated a technical strategy to program an LLM with significantly less computing power that nevertheless yielded an algorithm as good as the best U.S. LLM algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the need for ever-larger data sets was undercut by recent indications that in certain contexts, small language models could yield accurate algorithms. These most recent advances demonstrate principally that technical progress in AI remains rapid and unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is remarkable but can be fragile. Artificial intelligence closely studies a training database and derives an algorithm from it; the algorithm then goes out into the real world to evaluate previously unseen examples of the same phenomena as contained in the database. Depending on the type of AI, the algorithm performs various tasks with remarkable accuracy, including making predictions, identifying correlations, optimizing strategies, or generating text or other materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI’s fragility lies in its vulnerability to mistakes, some of which lie hidden in its stores of data or in the interworking of complex algorithms. Most technical mistakes in the use of AI algorithms arise from one of three broad categories: (1) the training database (this report looks particularly at drift and poisoned data), (2) the algorithm type (particularly generative AI, reinforcement learning, or a hybrid), or (3) the interpretation of the algorithm’s findings by the user (specifically automation and user bias). This set of mistakes should not be expected to be static; it is likely to change over time as technical advances eliminate some sources of mistakes and create new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical mistakes can occur regardless of the domain within which the algorithm is being used. The frequency with which the mistakes occur can vary among domains, as can their effects. Mistakes in the domain of war, of course, can have grave consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;training-database-errors&quot;&gt;Training Database Errors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training database problems—the first category of errors common to AI—occur when there are differences between the database and the phenomena in the real world that the algorithm is evaluating. Information from the real world is called an input, and the process of evaluating that input with the algorithm is called inference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue of the relationship between the entries in the training database and the inputs in the real world can be seen in an example using a powerful type of machine learning called supervised learning. Supervised learning uses a labeled database. For example, an image recognition algorithm might be trained on a large database with many images of military tanks, military trucks, and civilian school buses. Each image is labeled. The algorithm would study the images and distill for itself rules to correctly label previously unseen images of each of these types of vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algorithm could then be used in the real world to exam inputs of images of previously unseen vehicles. The expectation is that the algorithm would correctly identify each new input as either a military tank, a military truck, or a school bus. (The algorithm also should have an “other” category since it is likely to encounter other types of vehicles.) The entries of the training database are ideally selected to be as similar as possible to the expected inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a variety of reasons, though, the input data may be different or become different from the training database over time, in ways large or small. These differences can cause errors in AI algorithms used for inference in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, the accuracy of the algorithm’s findings could be undercut if, for example, the adversary military started to use civilian trucks or school buses to transport military equipment or personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drift&quot;&gt;Drift&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emerging differences between the training database and the input data is known as drift. Drift occurs when the phenomena in the real-world change over time. Eventually, the algorithm will become inaccurate because of the differences between the database and the inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a simple example, consider efforts to train an image recognition algorithm to identify where adversary troops are making camp during an invasion into a contested region. Intelligence services are confident that the adversary uses the same units and equipment in invasions that it does in exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The training database therefore uses pictures of the region during adversary exercises, where the adversary—say, the Russian army—moves its equipment into the contested region for all to see. The pictures in the training database capture the visual appearance of the equipment and the environment where the equipment is parked. The region is forested, containing many deciduous trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feared invasion occurs. Theoretically, the algorithm should help identify where the invasion forces are located to facilitate accurate blue targeting. New photographs are taken after the invasion to be used as inputs to the algorithm that was trained on earlier adversary exercises in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The images in the database that trained the algorithm, however, differ significantly from the images in the inputs. First, the Russians are using high-quality camouflage to conceal the tanks during the invasion. Second, the pictures for the training database were all taken during the winter, when the trees were without leaves—and the invasion occurs in the spring. These differences between the inputs and the training data will reduce the accuracy of the image recognition algorithm, possibly enough to render it unhelpful to targeting efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it remains the case that some types of patterns could reasonably be expected to repeat themselves: A vehicle that looks like a Russian tank, contains the same percentage of different metals as a Russian tank, and generates the same heat signature as a Russian tank probably is a Russian tank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The training database for an algorithm to identify Russian tanks could contain copious entries with each of these pieces of data. Algorithms to identify the same type of adversary equipment based on a training database that contained many different types of sensor data about each entry probably would be both accurate and robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how useful is such an algorithm on a battlefield where both friendly and adversary forces use Russian tanks? This potential complication demonstrates the importance of the analytical tools having qualitative in addition to quantitative elements. The qualitative components should aim to make certain characteristics of the algorithm accessible to the military personnel using it, helping them use their judgment to understand whether the intangibles of war render the algorithm unhelpful, even if its math is exquisite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While AI algorithms are remarkable, there are aspects of the use case and the training database that can be sources of errors. Identifying these aspects will require both technical and military expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STRATEGIES TO MANAGE DRIFT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, generalizations about robustness—the effectiveness of the algorithm for a similar but not identical use in the future—could be distilled. Training databases that contain multimodal sensor readings for the same piece of equipment—heat, visual, metal content, generated effluents—are likely, on balance, to be accurate and robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it remains to be demonstrated systematically that there will be sufficient alignment to make AI algorithms accurate for a particular use on a particular day, much less that the algorithm will be robust enough to provide confidence that it will be accurate in some future set of related but different, perhaps even unanticipated, use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commercial sector is one of the domains with the longest track record of using AI. Drift has proven to be consistent problem, and the commercial sector has developed a variety of strategies to manage it. Many businesses, for example, have developed techniques to measure the substantive difference between the training data and the input data. There also are techniques to measure the impact of drift, thereby facilitating an understanding of when retraining is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some businesses have standards that specify the rate at which they need to remove the oldest data and supplement the training database with new data to maintain the desired level of accuracy in the algorithm. This gradual replacement of the training data is called adaptive learning. The military should adopt some of these techniques and perhaps develop new ones to identify, measure, and responsibly manage the problems associated with drift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATTERNS IN TACTICS OR IN STRATEGY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fundamental question about war is how much of it is based on patterns. This is AI’s original gift: seeing patterns unrecognizable to humans because of their extraordinary complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, war is filled with unknowns, what Prussian General Carl von Clausewitz described as, “a fog of greater or lesser uncertainty.” He goes on to say, “A sensitive and discriminating judgment is called for; a skilled intelligence to scent out the truth.” AI, certainly a skilled intelligence of a sort, may well be able to lift some of the fog, but whether it can entirely eliminate it remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clausewitz also refers to war as “the realm of chance.” It is unclear whether what appears to be chance—unseasonable weather, an unexpected technical failing, a line of infantry that held when it was expected to fail—can in the future be predicted by a sufficiently robust AI algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence of a thinking, reacting adversary trying to exploit any overreliance on patterns seems likely to further complicate AI’s ability to understand war. Clausewitz pointed particularly to the challenges of rules predicting the course of “a continuous interaction of opposites.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are routine tasks at the tactical level such as aiming and firing an artillery piece, there also are more singular tasks such as a commander’s decision on when, where, how, and indeed whether to attack. Strategic decisions seem difficult to predict, particularly because the training database seems unlikely to be large enough or representative enough of the personality and experience of the relevant commander. Generals who share formal training often pursue very different strategies in war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many wars, or at least battles, have been won by the unexpected decision of a strategic commander: leaving a large wooden horse just outside the adversary’s well-secured city, or exploiting unsecured cockpits of large commercial jet liners traversing major urban areas. Could an algorithm anticipate the first uses of these stratagems, or move beyond pattern recognition to the type of creativity that wins wars?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report recognizes that the technology is advancing rapidly and that its abilities and their limitations in the future will be different than any interim assessment issued now. It is reasonable, though, to question what type of military decisions could be managed by artificial intelligence in the near- and mid-term. AI, with its persistent reliance on databases of previously acquired data, may be well suited to some types of military decisions (e.g., a firing decision) and poorly suited to others (e.g., high-level military tactics).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;poisoned-data&quot;&gt;Poisoned Data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further type of problem with training databases or inputs is the use of poisoned data by an adversary. Poisoned data is manipulated to exploit aspects of the algorithm to cause it to yield inaccurate results. This can arise either in the training data or in the input data. Militaries should expect and be prepared to defend against poisoned data attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example might be that an adversary has a missile that it programs to always follow a certain evasive maneuver: At a particular distance from the target, it always feints to the right before homing in on its mark. The data from these observed flights would be analyzed by the United States, who would almost certainly identify the consistent feinting to the right before impact. A resulting blue targeting algorithm for the red missiles would likely predict the feint to the right and incorporate that maneuver into its steps to locate the red missile in flight for targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately prior to the start of the invasion, however, red programmers could alter the pattern of the missiles to feint to the left instead. The blue AI algorithm would presumably aim the defensive missiles with the expectation that the red missiles would follow a feint to the right, as had been observed over the previous years of training and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example relies on a sudden discontinuity in behavior to confuse the algorithm, but poison data attacks often directly alter the physical information encoded into the algorithm. An adversary could alter just a few pixels in an image to cause the algorithm to incorrectly identify it. One study found that a photo of an academic building could be altered so that an image recognition algorithm identifies it instead as a dinosaur. To the naked eye, there is no difference between the two images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poisoned data attacks seem like the type of risks that would be both persistent and constantly evolving—an adversary would be launching these attacks ceaselessly, while switching up the method. The better an adversary understands how the blue algorithm is distilling its behavior or characteristics, the more effectively the adversary could trick the algorithm. This would be a particularly likely place to see the effects of Clausewitz’s “continuous interaction of opposites.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;algorithm-errors&quot;&gt;Algorithm Errors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second source of errors in AI is in the mechanisms of the algorithm itself. There are two main types of algorithms discussed here: (1) generative AI and (2) reinforcement learning. Each has a different combination of strengths and weaknesses. Generative AI is known to produce random answers or “hallucinations,” and reinforcement learning is vulnerable to poor or incomplete goals. This section also discusses the challenges of assessing hybrid algorithms, which can combine several different types of algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;generative-ai&quot;&gt;Generative AI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all its triumphs, generative AI—the type of AI that has fueled ChatGPT and other types of interactive models—is known to be vulnerable to mistakes, generating answers that are random or stochastic, meaning that some answers are not correct and the rate at which the algorithm will produce incorrect answers cannot be predicted with precision. This problem is more commonly known as hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, there are likely to be clever technical or mathematical strategies to manage this vulnerability. Technical strategies to assess the confidence associated with generative AI answers are emerging but are still in the research stage. Among the disquieting realities about generative AI is the observation that there is a rather poor understanding around how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report recommends that the DOD not incorporate generative AI into algorithms that are used in sensing and firing networks or other sensitive uses until there are significant advances in this type of algorithm to manage, mitigate, or eliminate its vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generative AI may be useful for other DOD functions, however, including screening materials for more fine-grained analysis by intelligence analysts. The department, though, needs to ensure that the use of generative AI is stated explicitly in the qualitative tools provided to military personnel and that its role is carefully evaluated in each use case because of its risk of erroneous outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generative AI, like all types of AI, is also vulnerable to reproducing errors or gaps in its training database. If the database is biased or out of date, answers generated by the algorithm also will be biased or out of date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least some of the recent efforts to improve the performance of generative AI algorithms have had unexpected and disquieting results, increasing the number of wrong answers given by the model and sometimes behaving in a way that a human would characterize as cheating to win in a competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these oddities arise from the way the algorithms are trained. Generative AI algorithms are trained on huge databases of information. In the case of a large language model, the database could be millions of websites totaling billions of words, images, videos, or sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model that emerges from this training is sometimes called a foundation model. Foundation models are often optimized for a particular use through the addition of a user interface. Most famous, perhaps, are the user interfaces that function as chatbots that interact with user questions. The user interface often involves additional training, which can both enhance the effectiveness of the interface for the user and introduce additional problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, chatbot interfaces often receive further training through reinforcement learning human feedback (RLHF), where a human reviewer is given two candidate answers to the same question and asked to identify the answer they prefer. This additional information about human preferences is used by the chatbot to refine the subsequent answers it generates for humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent study demonstrated—perhaps counterintuitively—that RLHF can increase the number of wrong answers an LLM provides. This is because prior to human training, the chatbot provided both correct and incorrect answers, as well as saying it did not know the answer to some questions. During RLHF training, it learned that humans did not like when it said it did not know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This led to the model answering a larger percentage of the questions overall—some right and some wrong—and saying it did not know the answer on a lower percentage of questions. By offering answers to a greater proportion of questions it was ignorant about, the chatbot had a higher rate of incorrect answers overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, recent studies indicate that even more sophisticated models called frontier LLM agents “can strategically circumvent the intended rules of their environment to achieve objectives, with more capable models showing this behavior more frequently.” When playing a chess game against another model, the more sophisticated models would “often observe that the chess engine is too strong for them to win against and then hack the game environment to win.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is work underway within the DOD to understand how generative AI could be safely integrated into the warfighting enterprise. However, the department should wait until the commercial technology sector makes significant progress in terms of accuracy before incorporating it into military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD, despite its many strengths, is unlikely to be the place that makes the technical breakthrough to render generative AI consistently accurate enough to be appropriate to perform safety-critical functions. It is reasonable to expect that at some point, generative AI could be incorporated into sensitive military capabilities. Based on current information, though, that point has not yet arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reinforcement-learning&quot;&gt;Reinforcement Learning&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD should also be careful with the use of reinforcement learning algorithms, which devise the optimal strategy to achieve a specific goal within the constraints of a set of rules. Superbly suited to chess or other board games where the goal and rules are well specified, these algorithms are powerful but face more of a challenge in the real world, where a thorough-going characterization of the “rules” and the “goal” is much more difficult. Already used in autonomous cars, this is the type of algorithm most likely to be incorporated into military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some artificial intelligence experts warn that as algorithms become more powerful, creative, and interconnected through the internet, there is a growing risk of a dangerous “alignment problem.” An alignment problem would emerge if the human programmer failed to fully specify the goal, and the algorithm misinterpreted the human’s intention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A famous thought experiment about this problem is that of an AI-driven robot in a paperclip factory being told to produce paperclips. When the unexpectedly efficient robot has used up all the designated raw materials for the purpose, the robot goes to the parking lot and tears bumpers off cars to make more paperclips, consistent with its understanding of the direction it received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example highlights the risk that humans will fail to caveat the specified goal in ways that they thought were implicit—either because the goal has changed over time, or the goal needed to be refined as preferences shifted. One leading thinker on reinforcement learning has urged computer scientists to increasingly move to program computers in a way that creates uncertainty about the goal on the part of the computer, so that it seeks regular updating and clarification from the human programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD should incorporate this insight for its reinforcement learning algorithms. In other words, it should adopt strategies to avoid alignment problems through one of two broad strategies: by (1) building deference into the goal definition to assure that the algorithm checks back in for further direction at significant and regular junctures, or (2) limiting the specific geographic area where the targeting should take place, the duration of the engagement during which the algorithm would be allowed to operate, and other characteristics of the engagement. Overly general guidance like “kill members of the opposing military” should always be avoided on principle and to avoid grievous misunderstandings by the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This modification in goal definition is important, as alignment problems emerging in targeting algorithms due to reinforcement learning could lead to the most dystopian of scenarios. The prospect of cars, houses, or—worst of all—people with certain characteristics being designated as targets by a roving uncontrolled robot should drive DOD programmers to incorporate the strategies in goal definition urged by thought leaders in the field of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hybrid-algorithms&quot;&gt;Hybrid Algorithms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integration of multiple algorithms into a single hybrid algorithm would represent an additional level of complexity. Many real-world applications already use collaborating algorithms: For instance, an autonomous car driven by a reinforcement learning algorithm receives as input the findings of a separate image recognition algorithm which identifies items along the prospective route and assesses whether they are likely to stay still (e.g., lampposts) or to move, possibly into the route of the car (e.g., a cyclist).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So-called hybrid models bind the inner workings of algorithms even more closely together than existing collaborative models. Every algorithm, like every measurement, is likely to have an error margin, even if it is an accurate algorithm. The error range for different algorithms would in general be expected to vary independently, i.e., one error is a little high, and the other error is a little low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this blending of different errors generally will not harm the final answer much, since the two errors often cancel each other out. There could be a situation, however, where all the errors trend in the same direction, and in that case, what were acceptably small errors in the supporting algorithms create an error of unacceptable size in the final, dominant algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take for example a reinforcement learning algorithm that identifies an optimal search path for blue forces to move through a red village. There are no strictly military items in this village, but certain dual-use items have been used by a guerilla force in other villages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The optimal search path is determined by several subordinate algorithms. These supervised learning algorithms evaluate images of dual-use items in the village to identify whether they are suspect or not suspect. Suspect items need to be approached cautiously by blue forces and carefully searched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For accuracy, it would be best if the underlying incidence of guerilla infiltration in the current village was the same as the underlying infiltration of the villages searched by the experienced soldiers who labeled each of the images in the supervised learning training database. Statistics and guerrilla infiltration, though, are not always in perfect alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say the experienced soldiers were sent first to the villages with the most evident problems with guerillas. Seeing many dual-use items in use by guerillas, the experienced soldiers would accurately reflect their experience by labeling many images in the training database as being suspect. The algorithm would then reflect the expectation that all villages had significant infiltration by the guerilla forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now trained, the algorithm is heading out to be used in the real world. The new village where the algorithm is being used, however, is not as intertwined with the guerrilla group as the first village. Very few of the dual-use items in fact are being used for military purposes. The dynamics created during the search by the difference between algorithmic expectation and reality could be lethal, particularly if other factors make the search tense, such as the blue force being weary or inexperienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example illustrates how an error in one algorithm could result in an even larger error in the overall hybrid algorithm. It should be noted that the original source of the error is another training database problem, namely that the original training database failed to reflect the underlying population from which the data was drawn. Qualitative tools that enable the leaders of small tactical units to thoughtfully evaluate warfare algorithms to assess whether they align with the actual conditions confronting the unit are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These hypothetical scenarios show why the accuracy of the algorithms—including hybrid algorithms—need to be closely analyzed in some technical detail, particularly at the outset, before responsible generalizations can be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;user-interaction-errors&quot;&gt;User Interaction Errors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third source of errors in AI algorithms arises from how the human being provided with the algorithm’s result interprets that result. These challenges are an issue in any domain where AI algorithms are used. The challenges of human-algorithm interaction in warfighting are likely to be particularly daunting because of the high stakes and the time pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also likely to be challenging because of the unusually broad range of types of interaction. These may include heads-up displays in aircraft and other vehicles, controls for robotic arms, or robotic exoskeletons. This extensive range evokes the complicated topic of human-machine interface. The DOD has a long and often successful background in managing these types of human-machine interface issues. This study acknowledges these complicated problems but does not seek to uniquely advance this important debate. The issues identified here are not from the unique human-machine interface context but rather arise from AI use in all types of domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;automation-bias&quot;&gt;Automation Bias&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automation bias is likely to be a significant vulnerability for military uses. The source of this error is in the readiness of a human operator to passively accept rather than rigorously reevaluate the finding of a complicated, quantitative process such as an AI algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is substantial evidence to support the presence of this risk. One study, for example, details an experiment where individuals were putatively being given a tour of a new building by a robot. As part of the study, the fire alarm suddenly goes off without explanation and smoke starts emerging from the hallways in front of the tour group. To the left of the group are clearly marked, smoke-free emergency exits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The robot urges the tour group to follow it into the smoky hallways, stating that these hallways offer the safest route out of the building. The overwhelming number of individuals who participated in this study followed the robot into the smoky rooms, as opposed to exiting through the visible and well-marked emergency exits immediately on their left. Similar automation bias has been documented in commercial flights, car navigation systems, AI for self-driving cars, and the business sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These “overtrust” risks appear to be heightened in time-sensitive, pressure filled contexts. The terrible rhythm of war has been discussed by several authors, and close study of these works indicates that once the battle begins there are a host of very human factors—including fear and revenge—that can compromise decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;user-bias&quot;&gt;User Bias&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While automation bias leads a user to passively accept the recommendation of an algorithm, user bias leads a user to accept the recommendation of an algorithm when it aligns with their expectation of the right answer, and to reject it when it does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a significant literature that demonstrates that quantitative findings consistent with a user’s preexisting views are more likely to be accepted as opposed to a finding that goes against previously held beliefs. Studies in the United States have demonstrated these effects in law enforcement, particularly in an algorithm that generated a score that purportedly reflected a defendant’s risk of recidivism: “Judges were more likely to accept low scores for white defendants, while overriding similar scores for black defendants.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are indications in the literature that some techniques for presenting the findings of algorithms, particularly when they are set in a larger context of the strengths and weaknesses of algorithmic decision aids, could mitigate the ill effects of both automation bias and user bias. Efforts within the DOD should seek to investigate such strategies and implement those that show promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;feedback-loop-bias&quot;&gt;Feedback Loop Bias&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback loop bias is a vulnerability of algorithms that use interactions with the algorithm as entries in an updated training database to further refine and update the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of such algorithms include Google search. Often, individuals who share a particular perspective on an issue are most likely to ask certain questions. When the algorithm offers nominated web sites, the bias of the individual may lead them to select a website congruent with that perspective. The next time the same question is asked, the algorithm will present the selected website as a higher nominee in the list of candidate responses to the search query. This is because the algorithm notes which nominated website was selected after a particular query was made. Selected webpages are then presented higher in the list of suggested websites in response to the same query the next time it is posed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates a feedback loop bias where the biased website is more and more likely to be selected and hence to rise to higher levels in the list of websites suggested in response to the query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Google search engine is an example of a mechanistically connected feedback loop bias. As has already been discussed, a hybrid algorithm can be vulnerable to the same problem at a slightly greater remove. The report previously described how soldiers who had cleared villages with wide-spread guerilla infiltration had been asked to label the images of dual-use items that are commonly found in villages as being either suspect (and hence needing a thorough search) or not suspect (and thus not needing a search). The images and their labeling were then used as the training database for a supervised learning algorithm which contributed to a reinforcement learning algorithm that mapped the best path for a blue tactical unit clearing a red village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general principal it is useful to use interactions with an algorithm to further refine and update it, but unanticipated effects in a military context should be carefully considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense experts need to move beyond wanting to add AI in general toward a more particular understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. AI algorithms have demonstrated a host of generic errors. These generally arise from errors in the training database, the mechanism of the algorithm itself, or from the user’s interpretation of the algorithm result. Tragedy beckons if the DOD uses AI for warfighting but fails to recognize these many sources of potential errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;characteristics-of-needed-analytical-tools&quot;&gt;Characteristics of Needed Analytical Tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report urges the creation of quantitative and qualitative tools to enable effective and responsible use of AI algorithms in war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantitative tools are needed for three purposes: accuracy, robustness, and wargame instrumentation. Accuracy is assessed in the field (e.g., would a missile launched from behind this bush destroy that enemy tank and only that tank?) while robustness is more of a prediction to inform decisions in the command center and Situation Room (e.g., would prospective uses in a specific operation yield the expected military effects with acceptable collateral damage?) Wargame instrumentation is more complex because it requires modeling interaction effects— in other words, both what the effects of the blue weapons would be and the tactics and outcomes of the red forces. Well-instrumented wargames consistently have been an element of a successful peacetime military innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is critically important that these algorithms are not treated as black boxes by the military personnel using them. Military personnel do not need to be experts in AI, but they should be able to identify and evaluate whether the conditions of the real-world operation are sufficiently aligned with the design specifications of the algorithm to ensure that it can be responsibly used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The qualitative tools should help military personnel make this assessment. Training materials and simulations should strive to highlight possible characteristics of a future operation that would render a standard algorithm too inaccurate to use in that operation. Alternative techniques to rectify problems with algorithms should be practiced in training exercises. Examples of these problems would include an operation where a friendly military is using Russian tanks, and the algorithm was trained to identify targets using the physical characteristics of Russian tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The qualitative tools should also help military personnel assess whether the algorithm’s confidence about distinction (i.e., accurately distinguishing noncombatants from combatants) needs to be adjusted given the characteristics of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, say such an algorithm is being used on an isolated military base. If new information about the context became available—for example, students from a civilian school are visiting the base—the blue military commander may need to increase the required confidence level for the algorithm to identify an input as a legitimate military target. The qualitative description of the algorithm should include the standard confidence level required for a positive identification and allow, in specified circumstances, on-scene commanders to adjust that confidence level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has discussed various training database problems, including drift and poisoned data. In a particularly dynamic battlefield environment, it may be necessary to enable a tactical commander to identify when the accuracy of the pretrained algorithm becomes too low. These units would ideally be equipped with the ability to build a new database in real time and train an algorithm to be much more accurate. Creating such a capability at the unit level will require new analytics and equipment, but may be the only strategy to deal with fast-changing battlefield situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of qualitative information would also be valuable in more complicated uses of AI. A plausible use case would be rapidly integrating information from different streams of sensor data. The most complex type of integration might well happen for the fastest-moving adversary systems (e.g., a hypersonic missile). In such a situation, there would be extreme time pressure to evaluate and ratify the assessment of the algorithm integrating each of the separate modalities of sensor data. However, the time pressure involved could severely limit the amount of real-time decisionmaking available to military commanders faced with an incoming attack. Trusting the AI might be the best—and indeed, only—course in this situation. Where then, do qualitative tools come in, in circumstances like these?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decision support systems should always contain explicit markings that a particular AI algorithm is being used, and the assumptions embedded in the algorithm should be available for study. But as in the example above, there should be no expectation that this qualitative data will always be studied during actual use. Rather, it would be available for review, and military personnel could be expected to review it during initial familiarization with sensors and before and after training sessions. Training—both classroom and exercise—should present scenarios where the assumptions in commonly used decision support algorithms are invalidated by some peculiarity of the scenario. Lessons learned sessions after the exercise should highlight the characteristics of the peculiarity that undercut the utility of the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective is to build some expertise within the user base about the embedded assumptions, so that military personnel could assess whether a characteristic of a particular use invalidated some of the assumptions. This is a far from a perfect solution, but it seems like the best method to both benefit from algorithms’ speed of integrating disparate sensor data and ensure that key system operators understand the assumptions embedded in these algorithms, so that they can identify those rare occasions when the assumptions might not hold and alter provisions accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluating the qualitative tools for any algorithm to be used in a mission should be part of the regular operating responsibilities of the fighting unit itself, not only a review conducted outside of the unit by the DOD Test and Evaluation community as has instead been widely recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ais-debut-on-the-battlefield&quot;&gt;AI’s Debut on the Battlefield&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first sustained campaigns of artificial intelligence in war have been observed in recent months on the battlefields in Ukraine and the border regions of Russia. These instances provide ample evidence for the realist argument that AI-enabled military capabilities could be decisive in war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine first used small inexpensive commercial drones for surveillance and reconnaissance. A drone was likely the source of the location data that enabled a Ukrainian solider to target the shoulder-fired missile shots outside of Kyiv that disabled the first and last Russian tanks in the convoy that was headed toward Kyiv—but never arrived—in the early days of the Russian attack on Ukraine in February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Ukraine and Russia have since become even more skilled at using drones. The Ukrainians have largely used commercial drones developed for racing and have made parts using 3D printers to optimize for different missions, yielding a remarkable capability with a low per-unit cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Ukrainian soldiers began placing small explosive charges on the drones. These jerry-rigged drones were maneuvered by a Ukrainian operator over a valuable Russian target, at which time the operator would detonate the explosive. In response, the Russians jammed the communications between the operator and the drone, preventing the detonation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any conflict with a calculating adversary, the measure and countermeasure competition between defense and offense quickly got underway. Cost, technology, and tactics help determine who gains the upper hand in any given scenario. In this case, the Ukrainians responded to the jamming (at least in part) by having the drone use an image recognition algorithm to identify the target and detonate at a specified distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may have been the first use of an AI sensor and firing network in warfare. It is a small network indeed but was often successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is significant exploration underway in Ukraine and in most militaries about the next phase of operational and tactical uses for AI and small platforms, particularly drones. There has been exploration of ideas for drone “swarms” operating together to advance a common objective. These plans sometimes seek to use these swarms of drones to overwhelm defenses and pursue attacks. There is speculation that these swarms might be able to penetrate even sophisticated defenses, possibly at significantly lower cost than the cost of the defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there has been meaningful progress in individual programs within the DOD, there should be a more systematic effort to understand, benefit from, and defend against these technologies. Peacetime innovation is difficult but vastly preferable to waiting for the lessons meted out in war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War can demonstrate how new technologies can be most effectively incorporated into military capabilities. Those lessons, though, are dearly bought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Henry Adams, who was quoted at the outset of this report, observed that there are limits to history’s right to meddle because of the complexity of emerging technologies. Meddling seems fraught indeed when one confronts the pace and complexity of advances in artificial intelligence. AI is enabling capabilities that are transforming most substantive domains more rapidly than the domain experts or the body politic at large can sort through the implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bombs educate vigorously, but algorithms used for quieter purposes are more likely to creep in unnoticed, reproducing and reinforcing historical bias, or eliminating privacy, the companion to civil liberty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD could play a useful role if it catalyzes the development of tools that lower the tremendous difficulty of assessing, managing, and controlling algorithms. These tools could move into nondefense applications as well, enhancing the ability of experts in other domains to manage AI use responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps citizens are prepared to passively accept the decisions of algorithms powering their news feeds or the weapons of the military fighting in their name. Perhaps they are even prepared to passively accept the decisions of their government, forgetting the rights they secured when it was first created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History may have no right to meddle. But citizens do and can strive to build the future they want. History will tell the story, but the people, by omission or commission, will write it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix-i&quot;&gt;Appendix I&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Meaningful Sensor and Firing Network&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has discussed how a theater-wide sensor and firing network, with other reforms, could shore up the effectiveness of the U.S. power projection strategy. This appendix examines the details of a sensor and firing network and evaluates its challenges in the context of the concerns expressed by the three schools of thinkers about the cause and effect of war: the realists, the liberals, and the humanitarians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, meaningful decisions must be made about the use of force. On this point, at least, there should be broad agreement among the realists, liberals, and humanitarians. The decision should be meaningful in the sense that it aligns with well-considered assessments of military effectiveness and law of war compliance. How to secure such meaningful decisions, of course, is highly contested in AI-enabled war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realists tend to judge that war is generally either being deterred or fought. Given this contested environment, realists feel urgency to improve warfighting capabilities. Realists tend to be optimistic that mistakes in algorithms could be managed if not eliminated and hence are inclined to develop such algorithms and enjoy the expected warfighting benefits of speed and precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberals tend to judge that it is possible to move beyond always having to deter or fight a war: Areas of cooperation between nation-states can be found, nourished, and sometimes sustained. Hence, efforts to build responsible algorithms can proceed at a measured and deliberate pace. Liberals also are concerned that AI-enabled military capabilities are significantly vulnerable to unwanted escalation. Unwanted escalation occurs when neither nation-state desired war but both fear losing if the other side attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanitarians center their attention on human life and strive to build, nourish, and sustain norms to reduce suffering, including suffering caused by war. These norms tend to focus on the basic humanity of all people, but they acknowledge differences between combatants and non-combatants during war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanitarians argue that the only way to assure meaningful decisions is to assure that a human is “in the loop” of a decision to target a particular item or to make and execute a firing decision. Under this view, relying on an algorithm, whatever its provenance, is inherently not meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locus of concern for these different perspectives can be shown by looking closely at the different stages of a sensing and firing network. The challenge for accuracy—a blue algorithm properly identifying and characterizing a red target—principally emerges in the first stage of the firing network. The second and third stage both raise the risk of unintended escalation, and the third stage is where the conundrum about what truly constitutes “meaningful” control emerges, whether it is a human in the loop or an automated decision based on prior human approval under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-first-stage&quot;&gt;The First Stage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stage of a sensor and firing network would be identification of a red target. The second stage would be the allocation of blue weapons against that red target. The third stage would be the decision to fire the blue weapons against the red targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the number of targets increases, the complexity of each of the stages also increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, as the number of targets increases, the information that needs to be acquired about each red target in the first stage also increases. The additional information is needed so that the blue weapons could be allocated against the red targets optimally, maximizing military effectiveness and minimizing collateral damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A red target could be in an isolated area on a military base with a strictly controlled perimeter and no civilians. Or, at the other end of a theoretical continuum, it could be in densely populated civilian area. Most targets, of course, are likely to be in a blended context, with some civilian assets in the general area of a red military target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some red targets will have various physical characteristics that need to be considered when assessing from a military point of view how to destroy them. Some of these characteristics require special munitions, such as deeply buried or heavily protected red targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red biological or chemical weapons stockpiles require special techniques to avoid lofting or otherwise dispersing the material in a manner that could contaminate surrounding populations or embedding it in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some red targets will be considered “perishable” in the sense that their location could change quickly, and they might be very difficult to locate again. This category often includes items like mobile missile launchers and sometimes includes command posts. It also might include a military unit that is still located at a base but is expected to move into a civilian area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some heavily defended red military targets might pose significant risks to blue piloted aircraft and so should be preferentially attacked by drones or other unmanned techniques. These are examples of the type of information about a red target that would be needed to inform the allocation of blue weapons against those targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this report has emphasized, these sensitive algorithms would require high standards for accuracy and robustness. Some algorithms—such as generative AI algorithms at their present state of technical development—are too vulnerable to errors to be used in such a network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Required confidence for a targeting algorithm should be “dialable,” with policymakers and commanders able to require a higher level of confidence for some missions in some contexts. The greater the risk that civilian and military personnel or equipment could be comingled should result in a higher level of confidence from a targeting algorithm. A lower (but still robust) level might be acceptable in a context that is confidently occupied by exclusively military equipment and personnel. This would be consistent with the requirements for distinction under the laws of armed conflict. Many argue that the precise effects of AI-enabled capabilities could, on balance, reduce collateral effects overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proportionality would require an assessment of the military benefit of a particular attack and its associated effects on civilian personnel or infrastructure. Certain munitions could cause more limited collateral damage than other types of munitions consistent with achieving the military objective. For example, a precision munition should be used in situations where the target is in a dense city environment and the overall calculation of military effect and collateral damage is assessed to be proportional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an illustrative list of the characteristics of a red target that should be acquired in stage one to inform the allocation process in stage two. The target needs to be identified, validated, and then characterized so that this information could be used in the next stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These requirements for stage one reinforce the challenges for a sensing and firing network. This report argues that algorithms should be used for military purposes only after they have been thoroughly vetted for their accuracy and robustness in their intended military use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall that all three of the classic protagonists between realists, liberals, and humanitarians agree that algorithms would be challenged in war. Realists seem more prepared to judge that these challenges could be responsibly overcome. Liberals and humanitarians warn that these challenges would be very difficult. Humanitarians judge them to be sufficiently difficult that it should not be attempted—that humans need to be in charge of authorizing individual targets and not relying only on algorithms to identify them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the view of this report, the realists make a compelling argument that there are many war-fighting benefits if these tasks could be performed at the speed of an algorithm. But only if the realists can demonstrate that the task is being done with proper care. Both military effectiveness and the law of war demand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-second-stage&quot;&gt;The Second Stage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second stage, allocating blue weapons against validated red targets, is well-suited to automation assuming that high-quality data would be available. As discussed, that is a big assumption for all but the smallest allocation of weapons against targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent to which the network would get accurate information is worth assessing, as well as its sensitivity to different levels of inaccuracy. It is currently difficult to maintain a common operating picture of blue weapons available in theater across all possible sources of those weapons. Putting together an integrated picture of red targets in theater, particularly with some of the fine-grained information this report argues for, is similarly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escalation risks emerge because of the cost of delay. A decision to execute the firing plan would be expected to destroy all the red targets. A decision to wait—to conduct additional negotiations, for example, so as to reconcile the point of contention at the heart of the conflict—could turn the prospect of victory for blue into the reality of defeat. Red could use the time to launch its own force package, destroying many blue assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the delay did not enable red to launch an effective attack, it would enable mobile red targets to hide, making it unlikely in many cases that their position could be found again; this might enable red to use some of their weapons against blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There would be the risk of new errors being introduced if the targets are not monitored after their validation in the first phase. For example, if significant time passes, a group of noncombatants traveling through the area might now surround a military target that was in an isolated area when initially identified and vetted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that unintended escalation is a danger only in those situations where neither state really wants a war. Uncertain about what the other side wants, and reticent to risk losing a war, they act first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This perception that military technology makes it likely that the attacker will emerge from the war victorious is called a period of offense dominance, while defense dominance means that the defender is expected, all other elements held constant, to win the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Periods where the military technology is offense dominant are judged to be very vulnerable to unwanted escalation. In contrast, a period where the military technology is considered defense dominant is generally considered to be much more stable. Most analysts predict that AI will be offense-dominant technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns about AI’s escalation risk seem warranted. If both sides had the comprehensive ability to launch a well-targeted, broad-based attack against the adversary’s forces through large firing networks, victory likely would go to the attacker. There would be pressure to move swiftly to launch before the other side launched. This is the type of reasoning behind the focus on secure second-strike capabilities in the strategic nuclear domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytically, offense-defense theory is powerful. It is worth noting that what seems clear to historians and political scientists, however, appears to be significantly less clear to at least some practitioners operating with the more blurred perspective of the moment. Henry Kissinger, for one, argued that while intellectually attractive, the theory was essentially impossible to implement because of the ambiguity about whether forces were in fact offense or defense dominant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General strategies for managing escalation seem particularly worthwhile in AI because of the poor understanding of the technology in general and by military experts in particular. More fine-grained strategies seem difficult to develop now given the limited understanding of how they would be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most basic tool for managing escalation risks is unclassified technical discussions between experienced defense experts, a subset of a category known as transparency- and confidence-building measures. Technical discussions could help each side understand the regular maintenance schedules of particularly sensitive weapons or create relationships that allow consultations when there are specific concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such discussions are relatively low-cost and low-risk if the participants are experienced professionals, they are worth pursuing for their benefits should an escalation risk emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usefulness of such discussions seems particularly powerful at this stage in the development of AI-enabled military capabilities. There is such poor understanding of how the algorithms would work that building a better picture of how allies, then friends, and then adversaries are thinking about this issue would be valuable. Ideally, this would help manage crises between two states if neither of them wanted war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine technical characteristics of AI-enabled military capabilities that would facilitate it being perceived as defense dominant to a potential adversary. The policy literature has not identified any plausible strategy for defense dominance or for transparency, both of which are helpful for managing escalation risks. Technical experts should consider whether there are any techniques to configure AI capabilities to help with these strategic problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing AI-related escalation risks should remain at the center of the policy agenda. As a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of AI-enabled military capabilities develops, there will be more opportunities to design better strategies to manage escalation risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-third-stage&quot;&gt;The Third Stage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third stage, making or executing a decision to fire, would have both escalation risks and automation concerns. Most pertinent to this stage are the compunctions of humanitarians, who, in the context of the United Nations, have urged the adoption of additional prohibitions in international law that would apply to AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principal element of this position has been the requirement for “meaningful” human control of the weapons systems. This requirement has been defined as prohibiting an algorithm from selecting a particular target and from authorizing the firing decision. A human would need to have a meaningful opportunity to evaluate and approve or disapprove the targeting and firing decision (being in the loop).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional regulations sought specifically by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) would have the effect of building additional space—in time and clarity—around nonmilitary targets to further reduce the risk of mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government, in the context of these negotiations, has opposed these prohibitions, calling instead for “appropriate” human control which could occur prior to an algorithmic target selection or firing decision and would be based instead upon thorough human vetting of an algorithm prior to its deployment and use. Such use of AWS would need to be, like all use of military force, consistent with the existing requirements under the law of war—distinction, proportionality, and humanity. These laws would require accurate and robust algorithms to power AWS. The United States military is required to operate under the law of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realists have tended to argue, when they have engaged with the humanitarian perspective, that both targeting and firing algorithms could be constructed and used in a well-considered manner that reflected the highest standards of military effectiveness and observance of the law of war. Former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter described himself as “optimistic this can be solved, like every other hard problem, with diligent technology-informed effort.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A realist might argue that such careful work could yield human control that was well-considered, indeed even meaningful in the common usage of the term. Much more meaningful, perhaps, than having an exclusive focus on having a human in the loop in a time-pressured, highly stressful situation, vulnerable to automation bias. Careful, meaningful human control, then, is needed, and one could argue is most likely to be better rendered in quiet analysis and considered decisionmaking well before the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The type of analytical tools called for in this report would be needed regardless of a final decision about autonomous target selection and firing. A human in the loop would have no easy time of it. While such individuals would doubtless do their best, they would confront the confusion and stress of warfare, combined with automation bias that tends to lead to the acceptance of the finding from an automated process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a wide range of perspectives in the humanitarian community. This discussion will examine more closely the position of the ICRC, which calls for two types of AWS to be entirely prohibited: those that are too unpredictable, and those that target human beings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the ICRC urges the adoption of four legal regulations on the use of any remaining AWS. The most significant of these is the requirement for effective human supervision of target selection and firing decisions. The other three regulations seek to build more space around targets to assure that there is a high threshold around them in terms of distance, decision time, and clarity, even with the requirement for effective human supervision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under these regulations, even autonomous weapons with effective human control could not be used in areas where there are civilians—there could only be military personnel or equipment. No blended areas would be allowed. The regulations also would require designating a specific area and delimited time period where the supervised AWS could be used. Outside of that space, even the supervised weapon system could not go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These additional regulations would build protective space around civilian personnel and assets. From the realist point of view, this additional space would not be needed because of the accuracy of the algorithms and would cost too much in terms of military effectiveness. The assumption about military effectiveness, though, requires that the type of analytical tools called for in this report have been developed, deployed, and used to assure compliance with the existing laws of war. Absent the development and use of such tools, it is not clear how either claims of military effectiveness or compliance with the law of armed conflict could be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ban-unpredictable-automated-weapons-systems&quot;&gt;Ban “Unpredictable Automated Weapons Systems”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICRC recommends that there be a ban on “unpredictable automated weapons systems.” As with so many proposed legal prohibitions, the critical issue would be what precisely the words mean, in this case what constitutes an unpredictable system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unpredictable could refer to what has been the principal concern expressed in this paper: that military commanders and senior officials need to have a sufficient understanding of the accuracy and robustness of AI-enabled military capabilities before they authorize their use in war. This understanding is essential to inform a judgment about proportionality and distinction as required under the laws of war, as well as the military utility of a planned operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICRC recommendations explain that unpredictable AWS “that are designed or used in a manner such that their effects cannot be sufficiently understood, predicted or explained” should be prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requirement that the effects be predictable seems reasonable, and indeed it is necessary to meet the already existing requirements of distinction and proportionality. However, this language could be interpreted as requiring that the functioning of the algorithm should be “explainable”—a trait that neural networks is acknowledged to lack at present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;neural-networks&quot;&gt;Neural Networks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most artificial intelligence benefits from the base algorithm being supplemented by something called a neural network, which gives it additional precision as demonstrated in analyses that use a test database. Neural networks generally are described as being a “black box” or having an “explainability” problem, and thus some analysts argue they meet the criteria to not be “sufficiently understood or explained.” This provision then could be interpreted to proscribe the use of neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their greater degree of accuracy is achieved by identifying the distinguishing characteristics of the inputs and assessing the relative influence of each of these characteristics on the output. In other words, the algorithm identifies the characteristics of a cat that are most useful to distinguishing it from a dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the more formal language of AI, the distinguishing characteristics are called “layers,” and their relative influence is called “weights.” The human programmer can specify the number of layers that should be used and is able to discern the weight assigned to each layer after the algorithm has been optimized by the computer. The human programmer generally cannot, though, figure out which distinguishing characteristic of the inputs each layer signifies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algorithm selects the layers after closely examining the inputs and identifying their important characteristics. The algorithm then tunes or adjusts the relative weighting of the layers until their relative weighting optimizes the accuracy of the algorithm. This unpacking of the characteristics of the inputs and then their relative weighting provides the additional precision available from neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highly skilled technical experts with significant computing power can unpack the substantive characteristics of some of the layers using post-hoc analysis. In other words, after the algorithm has optimized the weighting and completed its work, these high-end technical experts can go back and through a highly structured trial and error process generally sort out the substantive characteristic represented by the particularly high-impact layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always problematic when new provisions of international law are adopted which seem to mean different things to different people. Mandating an understanding of effects is reasonable but already required; being able to explain how neural networks work is currently impossible although they can be demonstrated to add precision. Based on the information available, neural networks appear to provide many benefits in terms of accuracy and few unique risks. Prohibiting them does not seem warranted on the available information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This additional prohibition could leave military capabilities developed in good faith to be prohibited from use because of a different or contested interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ban-targeting-of-humans&quot;&gt;Ban Targeting of Humans&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICRC also recommends a prohibition on algorithms that target humans. This is for two reasons: first, the ethical concerns that “center on the interrelated loss of human agency, moral responsibility and human dignity in life and-death decisions,” and second, the difficulty of distinguishing between active military combatants, inactive military combatants, and noncombatants. Military combatants are considered inactive if they have been wounded, surrendered, or are sick. Inactive military combatants are considered out of combat and thus not a legitimate military target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proposed prohibition may be redundant, as it is difficult to come up with ideas for algorithms that targeted active human combatants that would be accurate and robust without the use of extensive context clues like the individual standing behind an artillery piece and pulling the trigger. Most other ways of identifying this population would be too easy to alter, such as the military combatants changing out of uniforms and into civilian clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, the U.S. military already has the responsibility to have significant capabilities for distinction under the current law of armed conflict. There should be a high threshold for the use of any algorithm that targets a human being and extremely thorough vetting before the use of any such algorithm was authorized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regulations&quot;&gt;Regulations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the prohibitions called for above, the ICRC recommends four regulations to limit the use of any remaining autonomous weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DISTINCTION BETWEEN MILITARY AND CIVILIAN TARGETS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first proposed regulation states that algorithms could only be used to target (with effective human supervision) “objects that are military objectives by nature,” while the third regulation would impose “limits on situations of use, such as constraining them to situations where civilians or civilian objects are not present.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These regulations would significantly supplement and reinforce the requirement under the law of war for distinction. They supplement the requirement for effective human control and not targeting a human. The language about constraining AWS to situations where neither civilians nor civilian objects are present would greatly expand the safety zone around items and personnel, appearing to rule out the use of AWS in areas where there are both civilian and military targets blended together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DURATION, SCOPE AND SCALE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second regulation would require “limits on the duration, geographical scope and scale of use, including to enable human judgement and control in relation to a specific attack.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be a useful best practice for this to be a technique by which some AI-enabled military capabilities operate. This approach has significant promise to avoid some of the risks of reinforcement learning algorithms, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, however, the United States should not agree with this regulation as a legal prohibition, because there exists a small number of use cases that would not be compatible with it but still legal under the law of war and broadly useful to both the military and civilian population in an area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example would be a drone that followed a container with biological weapons. Maintaining positive surveillance of the container could be mission critical and would be complicated by the recommended strict limits on duration and geographical scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AWS could be programmed to follow the container until it could identify a suitable method and location to destroy the container without lofting. Destruction should not occur where there would be effects from the lofting of the weapons into the environment and the surrounding populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EFFECTIVE HUMAN SUPERVISION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth regulation would require “human–machine interaction, notably to ensure effective human supervision, and timely intervention and deactivation.” This raises one of the most persistent issues—whether a human needs to be in the loop of algorithm-directed targeting and firing decisions. Recall that under the ICRC prohibition, this would apply only to algorithms targeting equipment or buildings, as the targeting of humans has already been prohibited under another aspect of the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not algorithms could responsibly target and make a firing decision remains to be demonstrated through the type of analysis called for in this report. Certainly, the responsibilities under the current law of war should be taken seriously. Humanitarians certainly have some evidence on their side that this has not invariably been the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report argues that appropriate tools to assess and predict the effects of a military strike need to be developed. Once developed, these tools could assist human commanders to carefully assess targeting and firing decisions much earlier, when there is still time to do careful analysis of the algorithms. This assessment could enable the responsible human preauthorization of targeting and firing by algorithms, under carefully proscribed rules. The midst of warfare very rarely provides time for the careful deliberation properly desired amidst so much violence, whatever the hopes that it could be “meaningful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realists are correct to argue that AI-enabled military capabilities—assuming they are accurate and responsible—could make the difference between victory and defeat in the wars the United States most needs to deter or, if necessary, fight effectively. Battlefields including in Afghanistan and Ukraine provide tantalizing evidence that these can be transformed into war-winning capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the cautions brought to bear by liberals and humanitarians about escalation risks and basic humanity also are powerful. There should certainly be a presumption against the targeting of humans. If such targeting algorithms are ever adopted, they should have a particularly thorough vetting process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core message of this report is that vastly better tools must be developed to assess the accuracy and robustness of AI-enabled military capabilities. Significant confidence in these systems would need to be built before autonomous firing of any targets, much less of human beings, could be authorized. Once they could be responsibly authorized, however, it is difficult to deny that their speed and precision could confer significant warfighting benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this technological and strategic moment, AI-enabled military capabilities could help to deter war and, if necessary, fight it effectively. On this point, the realists seem to be right. But they forget too often that they are right only if the effects of these capabilities could be accurately predicted. Without such tools, neither wartime effectiveness nor observance of the law of war could be assured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix-ii&quot;&gt;Appendix II&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Crucible for Reform&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI-enabled military capabilities of various sorts seem a promising technique to strengthen U.S. military forces in the near- and mid-term. Such capabilities also need to be defended against: AI-enabled military forces could be used by an adversary to further erode the force balance and weaken deterrence in key regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD is not moving quickly enough to incorporate these emerging technologies or to embed them in operational concepts. Making thoroughgoing reforms to the DOD’s processes will be complicated and time consuming. This report urges the secretary to instead launch a focused effort to incorporate AI-enabled military capabilities more swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secretary of defense should direct select combatant commanders to develop new operational concepts using AI, empowering them through the grant of special authorities for AI, related communications, and small platforms, particularly drones. The select combatant commanders should include at least the combatant commanders of the Special Operations Command, the Indo- Pacific Command, and the European Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These authorities would allow the commanders to navigate around some of the most serious problems within the DOD’s current processes and structures. They would align responsibility for planning for wartime missions with budget authority, acquisition authority, civilian and military personnel assignment and hiring, and freedom from many regulations on encryption and classification, among other topics. This context should create a promising environment for identifying operational concepts for the use of AI-enabled military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also specifies that developing analytical techniques to understand and predict the effect of using algorithms in war and to instrument wargames would be among the responsibilities of the select combatant commanders, as well as of a reorganized organization in the OSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This grant of authorities to the combatant commanders should be reviewed by the secretary of defense after two to four years. The secretary could decide to keep these authorities with the combatant commanders or reallocate them in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this review point, there should the selection of an appropriate set of DOD-wide analytical tools and their consistent use thereafter should be overseen by the new OSD office. Directing multiple organizations to develop the same tools during the experimentation period may yield some duplication. However, developing the tools will be difficult analytically and the alternative approaches should help assure that many different perspectives inform the final metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the authorities proposed would empower the select commanders to develop new operational concepts and AI capabilities through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;giving them funding and decision authority for the development and acquisition of AI, related communications, and small platforms, including drones;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;giving them authority and empty billets to build military and civilian teams with needed expertise through by-name requests and special hiring authorities;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;empowering them to waive regulations (e.g., classification, encryption);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;allowing them to identify the tactical problems for analysis;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;directing them to develop defenses against attacks on algorithms; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;directing them to develop analytical tools and wargame instrumentation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well-structured competitive process as recommended here could align the disputatious nature of the Pentagon with the objective of the United States for its military forces: developing the best-possible military capabilities in this era of profound strategic and technological change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis alone, of course, would not enable a good idea to triumph in the bureaucratic battles within the Pentagon. New war-winning operational concepts rarely emerge by acclimation in large bureaucratic militaries; there are too many established skills, capabilities, and weapons systems that new concepts would render unnecessary. For important findings to be persuasive, they often need to emerge from well-run, well-instrumented war games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a properly structured competition undergirding the wargames can create incentives to unearth good ideas and give them visibility. Visibility through the wargames may buy good ideas enough time to demonstrate their promise to observers, at least some of whom may help the ideas survive to maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vesting senior military officers with the principal responsibility to devise innovative operational concepts does not ignore the historical reality that senior military officers do not in fact invariably come up with war-winning innovations—sometimes they come from senior civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But both history and common-sense caution that whatever the source of the good idea, it will need to be embedded in military tactics and units and so will ultimately have to be accepted by at least some senior warfighters. The wargames recommended here should provide the opportunity for a good idea—whatever its parentage—to be seen and evaluated. This would provide enough of an opening for an effective civilian leadership team to build support among at least some military allies to secure the adoption of their best ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;empower-senior-warfighters&quot;&gt;Empower Senior Warfighters&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting select combatant commanders in charge makes sense. The combatant commanders are the best proxy in the DOD for a senior official in charge of planning for and prosecuting a specific war. Combatant commanders are four-star generals or admirals assigned to one of eleven broad sets of responsibilities, such as protecting and advancing U.S. defense interests in Europe or the Pacific region. They tend to focus on specific, concrete military challenges and integrate the contributions of each of the military services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the separate military services—the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force—each bring a valuable long-term perspective that focuses on the general challenges presented by their domain (land, sea, air, or space). Each has a proud tradition and particular expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military services and their associated departments have the responsibility to train and equip the force. In practice, this means that the services hire young people and manage their careers as they grow into more senior officers and enlisted personnel. These careers generally are shaped around training and assignments in domain specific equipment, challenges, and units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The services also research, develop, and acquire most weapons systems. The OSD or the Joint Staff have a variety of ways to influence service decisions—some direct, some indirect, and some negligible. The vast amount of people and dollars in the DOD are controlled directly by the services, whose decisions are shaped in part by the preferences expressed by the secretary, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secretary of defense has vast formal authority but confronts extraordinary constraints from the sheer complexity of the enterprise. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates observed, “The very size and structure of the department assured ponderousness, if not paralysis, because so many different organizations had to be involved in even the smallest decisions. The idea of speed and agility to support current combat operations was totally foreign to the building.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combatant commanders’ focus on specific military problems is ideal for the task of developing algorithms because AI will do best if they focus—at least at the outset—on specific use cases in a particular geographic context. The combatant commanders might, for example, be thinking in a detailed manner about how to contribute appropriately to stopping or slowing a Chinese attempt to secure military control of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As specific algorithms are validated in these more limited contexts, both the algorithms and the methods to measure their accuracy could be expanded to assess more general applications. This work could yield general insights about the sensitivity or durability of algorithms for related but different uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combatant commanders also make sense because they generally are experienced strategic and military leaders, comfortable specifying objectives and holding large organizations to account for meeting those objectives on a specified timeline. Most are comfortable making difficult decisions to replace ideas or subordinates who consistently fail to deliver. They want to win, particularly in high-visibility competitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assigning the task of developing AI-enabled operational concepts to select combatant commanders also avoids the turmoil of creating, staffing, and provisioning a new organization for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combatant commanders also make sense because the chain of command for military operations runs to them through the secretary of defense from the president. This would make the combatant commanders responsible for any future decisions recommending or ordering the use of sensitive AI-enabled military capabilities. Aligning responsibility for the use of AI capabilities with the development and assessment of those capabilities seems appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has recommended that the use of sensitive AI algorithms should require authorization in the rules of engagement for a military operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering whether to keep the funding and acquisition authority at the combatant commanders, the secretary will want to consider the longer history of Special Operations Command (SOCOM). SOCOM uniquely among the combatant commanders has its own budget and acquisition authority, in its case for “[Special Operation Forces] peculiar” equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOCOM has been pointed to as being more amenable to incorporating artificial intelligence because of their more streamlined acquisition process and innovative ethos. AI, though, should not be restricted to SOF; it would be important to include at least the commands in the Pacific and Europe in this effort. The swift acquisition track record and ethos of SOCOM is widely acknowledged but it has also sometimes raised classic concerns about the proper balance between innovation and oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-dod-and-high-tech-startups&quot;&gt;The DOD and High-Tech Startups&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A persistent problem for the DOD is that it is not an attractive customer for the tech startups that have the greatest expertise in cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence. The DOD’s processes are too bureaucratic and slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several new authorities would be given to combatant commanders under this proposal. These would include moving money and decision authority for the development and acquisition of AI, related communications, and small platforms to the select combatant commanders. The commanders could contract with many sources including the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), the services, commercial startups, or more traditional DOD contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The personnel authorities would enable the combatant commanders to hire respected DOD acquisition experts with a demonstrated track record of responsibly using faster acquisition tools like Other Transaction Authorities. These tools enable the DOD to execute contracts on a time frame appropriate to the commercial technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of the hiring authorities would contribute across the board. Innovators in any field are difficult to find, and once found, are difficult to protect and allow to flourish. The authority to make by-name requests for military personnel should facilitate building the needed teams. As the term “by-name request” suggests, the combatant commander could request a specific military officer; generally, the position has to be posted in more generic terms (a 0–6 with the following military operational specialty…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combatant commanders also should be able to attract top technical and engineering experts. There should be funding and authorities to hire a variety of external civilians to enable excellent technical advisors to come on board to advise the commanders and their teams, in addition to the civilians working as part of an external team of contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing the development of these AI and AI-related capabilities in the combatant commands should help avoid persistent problems like the limited interoperability among the service systems. The combatant commands are joint—meaning that they integrate the contributions of the services—and thus emphasize the type of interoperability that will be needed for the integrated networks generally envisioned for AI systems such as an integrated sensor and firing network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-dod-and-creative-destruction&quot;&gt;The DOD and Creative Destruction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not a single prescription for creativity in war. Military innovation, particularly in peacetime, benefits from an idea about the nature of the future of war, an understanding of specific military problems, and an iconoclastic readiness to cause a little creative destruction. It often includes a good understanding of new technologies, and is informed by rigorous analysis, including tough lessons-learned reports and well-instrumented wargames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The call for wargames and the development of metrics, both quantitative and qualitative, seeks to ensure the wide availability of quality analysis often correlated with successful peacetime innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The personnel authorities should enable the combatant commanders to put together an ideal team: By-name requests for military officers and access to civilian hiring authorities would enable them to find military officers with a demonstrated interest and ability in innovation and technical experts interested in working with the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competitive element between the different combatant commands and the commands and OSD seeks to overcome the inertia of any bureaucracy in favor of the existing approaches. The prospect of at least two years and not more than four years creates time pressure to demonstrate progress to make the case for keeping the authorities at the combatant command level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authority to waive regulations should enable investigation of interesting trade space, of at least two types. The first is how, within a fixed cost, to best trade between large numbers of platforms with low capabilities and small numbers of platforms each with high capabilities. The DOD has started some efforts to explore these issues. Giving the combatant commanders the ability to waive many regulations on encryption or robustness of communication allows real experimentation with low-cost options—requirements for high-end encryption or robust communication drive up the per unit cost, while obviously providing often valuable capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second interesting trade space is how to classify algorithms trained on large databases containing only a small amount of classified data. The benefit of unclassified algorithms would be the elimination of expensive infrastructure surrounding all classified items and the limited availability of the resulting algorithm for some uses, allies, and friends. The risk is that the algorithm could be reverse engineered and so an adversary could acquire the classified information and learn about sensitive sources or methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigating this trade space is important because the default decision could be to classify any algorithm at the level of the most sensitive piece of information in its training database. The benefits and risks of different classification norms should be investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combatant commanders are directed to conduct their work to the maximum extent possible in safe “sand boxes,” or controlled environments within which AI and related capabilities can be tested without having immediate real-world consequences. There is an acceptance of some risk when investigating new, promising operational concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-dod-and-oversight&quot;&gt;The DOD and Oversight&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spurring innovation while preserving appropriate oversight is difficult. This report has made a distinction between sensitive uses of algorithms and other uses. It proposes that sensitive uses of algorithms require explicit approval by the secretary of defense in the rules of engagement for an operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules of engagement are the rules governing the use of force by U.S. military members. The secretary of defense approves standard rules of engagement and operation-specific rules of engagement for high-profile or risky operations. Subordinate commanders also may issue supplementary rules of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a category of sensitive algorithms that require approval at the secretary’s level would be a valuable method for assuring that these algorithms get the oversight appropriate to their use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensitive uses would include time-sensitive targeting or firing algorithms, regardless of whether there was a human in the loop. Algorithms embedded in processes that are not time sensitive and include multiple levels of review, including by human experts, would not be considered sensitive. Other algorithms should be evaluated for whether they should properly be considered sensitive and thus receive this high-level of scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requiring approval in the rules of engagement for the use of sensitive algorithms would assure oversight. The department’s top officials would review materials going to the secretary of defense for decision from many perspectives, including professional military judgment, strengths and weaknesses of AI, and law of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These officials would bring their expertise and that of their staff to consider important questions, including: How well do these algorithms work in general? How well are they likely to work in this specific operation? What could go wrong with the algorithms? Could their use violate the law of war?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time, the process and lessons learned could identify systematic problems that should be more closely examined in the context of the DOD’s regular budget review or other processes. Because of the size and complexity of the DOD budget, the budget review process can identify only a small number of issues for closer review and scrutiny by the most senior officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DoD’s review processes generally are highly structured and organize decisions for review and ultimately approval by the secretary of defense. The most prominent of these processes is called the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution process, which formally reviews selected topics from the various parts of the DoD budget as they move up the chain of command for approval before appearing in the government’s budget request to the Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There also are processes for major acquisition programs and for the validation of future military needs or requirements. These processes generally are characterized by meetings of increasingly senior groups of officials in the DOD, typically including representatives from the military services or departments, the combatant commanders, the Joint Staff, and the OSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report has called for a reorganized OSD office to confront the unique complexities of using AI in war. It should include experts in two difficult technical areas: (1) artificial intelligence and its management, and (2) warfare and its conduct and analysis. Experts should be drawn from several existing offices and positions in the Pentagon, including the CDAO, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for plans and posture, the director of cost assessment and program evaluation; and the director of test and evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separating the technologists from the warfighters, as current efforts largely do, would maintain distance despite the desperate need for greater communication across these substantive domains. Communication and some shared understanding between experts in these two domains will be essential to highlight where AI could be vulnerable to errors in wartime contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the report recommends ensuring that leading academic thinkers on artificial intelligence—ideally as a part of the JASON group of technical advisors—review how the DOD intends to use these technologies. The JASON group is a small, self-selected group of Nobel Prize winners and other leading technologists in the United States who advise the national security community on some of its most vexing strategic and technological issues. This expertise is essential given the rapid pace of AI technologies and the unique risks of using AI for military purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-2&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proposal would create the context most likely to produce new operational concepts to effectively employ AI in war and to defend against its use by an adversary. It moves the money and authority to senior warfighters with responsibility for planning and fighting the nation’s wars for at least an initial period of experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should facilitate tapping into the companies at the forefront of global, commercial cutting-edge technologies and assembling teams of creative, iconoclastic military officers and civilian experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change is hard. Creative destruction in any large bureaucracy is difficult, and it is particularly difficult for a military service that can only select its leaders from individuals who have had successful careers in the organization that needs fundamental reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence seems a beguiling solution to complexity. Realist have expressed confidence that its risks can be responsibly managed. Former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter declared that “good engineering design can accommodate both high performance and good ethics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let the realists get their “diligent technology-informed effort” underway. Require careful assessment of their claims of accuracy and robustness and oversee closely the use of the most sensitive algorithms in war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence may prove, like war, to be less understandable and compliant than had been expected. But this too is surely better understood sooner rather than later. Education of various sorts lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

This report analyzes 37 port projects and provides a new method for assessing their relative risk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is rapidly expanding its influence over maritime ports across Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). By building, financing, and buying up key ports, Chinese firms have become deeply embedded in the physical infrastructure connecting the region’s dynamic maritime economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these investments bring commercial opportunity, they also open the door for Beijing to gain strategic leverage, collect sensitive data, and expand its geopolitical influence closer to U.S. shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HYVq7la.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concern over China’s growing role in the region has centered on several ports located along the strategic Panama Canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fears that China could control the vital chokepoint have even triggered President Donald Trump to talk of “reclaiming the Panama Canal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fxUydt4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s presence in LAC ports extends far beyond the Panama Canal. Yet, the true scope of China’s reach—and the resulting risk to the United States—is poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a new database, CSIS identified 37 port projects tied to Chinese companies in LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BxFL3ic.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The database offers a novel methodology to assess the relative risk that each project poses to the security of the United States and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It reveals that China’s interest in LAC ports is more widespread, and the risk more varied, than previously known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;redefining-risk&quot;&gt;Redefining Risk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the alarm around China’s growing influence over global port infrastructure has focused on the Chinese navy’s push to establish overseas naval bases. In places like Djibouti and Cambodia, China first poured billions of dollars into civilian infrastructure projects before establishing military facilities—a playbook it could seek to emulate elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the risk is far more nuanced with LAC ports. In the near term, Beijing is unlikely to overtly establish naval facilities so close to the continental United States, given the risk of blowback from Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, gaining influence over strategic ports could provide China with critical advantages short of a formal military presence. Control or deep involvement in port operations can enable intelligence collection on U.S. and allied naval movements, privileged access to maritime logistics data, and the ability to deny or delay access during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent conflicts have shown how dual-use civilian infrastructure can be repurposed for covert military operations in concerning ways. The Ukrainian military’s Operation Spider’s Web involved drones launched from shipping containers to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Israel has reportedly used similar tactics, smuggling explosive drones into Iran via commercial freight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/y2QVkP8.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Containerized weapon systems, like those used in Operation Spider’s Web, could be positioned within foreign-controlled port infrastructure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign-controlled port infrastructure could serve as a platform to enable similar attacks. China has already developed a shipping container–based cruise missile launch system that could enable it to conceal strike capabilities within ordinary commercial cargo. Influence at ports could help ensure systems like these arrive where they need to be and evade inspection until they are ready to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond military risk, control over ports also gives Chinese firms leverage over key nodes in regional supply chains, enhancing Beijing’s economic and diplomatic sway across LAC. Over time, ports can help to rewire trade relationships and solidify economic partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risk-score-methodology&quot;&gt;Risk Score Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proxy for the strength of the host country’s military relationship with the United States. This is a composite score based on four equally weighted sub-indicators: arms sales, number of military exercises conducted in the host country, major non-NATO ally status, and the number of military facilities accessible to the United States during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Relative Weight: 60%&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent to which a Chinese firm may be able to exert operational authority or control at a port. This indicator is a composite of four sub-indicators: ownership share (15% weight), operational share (15%), primary cooperation mode (40%), secondary cooperation mode (15%), and SOE involvement (15%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Relative Weight: 10%&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether any company involved has been listed as a Chinese Military Company by the Department of Defense or is known to maintain significant institutional ties with China’s military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;China-Host Ties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Relative Weight: 20%&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likelihood of the host country favoring or aligning with China. This is a composite indicator based on the average of five equally weighted sub-indicators: net favorability score, trade with China as % of the total trade, the number of high-level PLA official visits, arms sales, and Freedom House score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk, in this context, is best understood not as the likelihood of the establishment of a formal Chinese military base, but as the strategic vulnerability created when critical maritime infrastructure is both important to U.S. operations and subject to Chinese influence. Specifically, risk is defined as a combination of two factors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extent to which the United States relies on a particular port in the LAC&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The degree to which China can accrue an advantage by influencing the operation of the port, particularly during a time of crisis on the verge of armed conflict&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on this framework, CSIS assessed China’s involvement in LAC ports across 37 distinct projects. These projects vary significantly in nature—ranging from cofinanced infrastructure loans to full ownership and operational control by Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each port was scored based on 11 indicators that measure both U.S. reliance and China’s potential influence. These indicators include factors such as the host country’s diplomatic alignment, proximity to major maritime chokepoints, and whether the port is physically capable of hosting military vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indicators were also weighted by their relative importance to overall risk. Because China’s ability to exploit a port hinges most on the nature and depth of its involvement, the China influence score was weighted more heavily than U.S. exposure in the final risk calculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-port-projects-in-lac&quot;&gt;Chinese Port Projects in LAC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the risk evaluation in this study does not attempt to predict China’s intentions. Beijing may never seek to use its influence over port infrastructure for any malign purposes. Rather, this analysis measures the potential capability China could gain through its role in port infrastructure, whether to disrupt U.S. trade, monitor naval activity, or enable coercive or covert operations in a future crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many ports pose little threat, several stand out as high risk due to their strategic location and the extent of Chinese influence. Chief among these are the Port of Kingston in Jamaica and the Mexican ports of Manzanillo and Veracruz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kingston&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Risk Score: 70.7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The port of Kingston, Jamaica, received a score of 70.7 out of 100, making it the riskiest port in the database. The ninth-largest port in LAC by throughput, Kingston sits at the crossroads of vital Caribbean shipping routes, including U.S. commerce passing through the Panama Canal and the Mona Passage, the strait between Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. It is also the highest-ranking port operated by a Chinese SOE, granting Beijing a higher degree of control over its operations compared to privately managed facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risks associated with this port go beyond economic disruption. Jamaica plays a strategic role in the western Caribbean and is a long-standing regional security partner for the United States. China’s leverage over the largest port in a country so vital to U.S. interests in the Caribbean represents a major vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just 170 miles away, the presence of U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in southern Cuba means that any large-scale military activity in the Caribbean would likely involve ship movements in and around Jamaica and potentially the Port of Kingston. China’s ability to combine intelligence from this port with potential access to signals intelligence facilities in Cuba could generate valuable insights into U.S. naval operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Port of Kingston is just one facet of China’s broader influence in Jamaica. China has been heavily involved in infrastructure projects across the island. In 2017, the state-owned China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) was awarded a $458 million contract—financed by the China Development Bank—to build the country a new highway system in exchange for exclusive rights to collect toll revenue for the next 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manzanillo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Risk Score: 70.0&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The massive port of Manzanillo on Mexico’s Pacific coast ranked second-highest in the risk index, at 70.0 out of 100. Manzanillo scores especially high in terms of U.S. exposure due to its outsized role as a hub for cargo heading to and from the United States. The spillover effects for U.S. trade from a disruption at this port could cost the U.S. economy more than $130 million a day, the most significant impact of any port in the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The port also serves double duty as headquarters for Mexico’s Pacific Naval Force, meaning China’s influence could also enable it to collect intelligence on Mexican military operations, including joint exercises with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China exercises influence over the port through multiple channels. First, the TIMSA port terminal is one of seven facilities operated by the Hong Kong–based holdings company CK Hutchison in LAC (including four in Mexico). Second, the People’s Bank of China, together with the Inter-American Development Bank, cofinanced a major expansion of the port in 2015. As part of the project, CHEC built a new container and logistics facility, and Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries (ZPMC) supplied and installed several new cranes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Manzanillo sits at the heart of U.S.-Mexico tensions concerning China’s growing influence in the country. The China-Mexico sea route is one of the fastest-growing shipping lanes in the world. Intending to capitalize on this, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has announced a new $2.7 billion investment in Manzanillo, seeking to double the size of the port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also of note, Manzanillo’s location in Colima state—a territory hotly contested between the Jalisco Cartel New Generation and local rivals—makes it an appealing target for organized crime. In December 2024, 25 tons of fentanyl precursors were seized at the port, the majority of them arriving from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Veracruz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Risk Score: 64.7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an overall score of 64.7 out of 100, the Mexican port of Veracruz scored the third-highest in the dataset. Like Manzanillo, it hosts a Hutchison-operated terminal, and both CHEC and the U.S.-blacklisted China Communications Construction Company have helped expand the port in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Manzanillo, however, the port’s location on Mexico’s Caribbean coast orients it more toward trade with the United States than Asia. While the port is much smaller in terms of overall volume of trade, disruption at Veracruz could still cost the U.S. economy $63 million a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2025, the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Gravely docked at Veracruz following over a month patrolling the Gulf of Mexico, underscoring the port’s value to the U.S. Navy as a regional resupply hub. As U.S. naval activity in the region ramps up with the White House’s increasing attention on southwest border security missions, China may benefit from new intelligence-gathering opportunities when these ships come to port for resupply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-build-or-to-buy&quot;&gt;To Build or To Buy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite widespread perceptions that China has full operational control over its port investments in LAC, the reality is far more complex. Just 10 of the 37 Chinese-linked port projects identified in this study involve active facilities owned or operated by Chinese firms. The rest reflect a mix of financing, construction, or equipment supply—each with different risk implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction projects, for example, appear aligned with China’s broader economic strategy in LAC, which revolves around securing preferential access to key commodities. To this end, Chinese firms have invested in expanding Peruvian ports near key mines, Brazilian bulk grain terminals, and Venezuelan oil export sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These projects generally pose less direct risk than those operated by Chinese companies, but they still create long-term dependencies and relationships with host-country elites, port authorities, and customs agencies. They also create an opportunity to introduce Chinese technology at a port that could provide an intelligence back door even without a daily Chinese presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Bez7eAu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KE8QP82.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equipment from Nuctech and ZPMC, for instance, has been installed in at least five ports in the database not under Chinese operational control. Similarly, in Panama’s Colón Container Terminal, Chinese state-linked telecommunications firms Huawei and ZTE—both blacklisted in the United States for their ties with China’s military—provided 300 security cameras. While the contract between Panama and Shandong’s Landbridge group was ultimately cancelled, these cameras remain in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 10 currently active ports operated by a Chinese company, seven are managed by a single company, CK Hutchison. These include major terminals at Manzanillo, Veracruz, Balboa, and Cristóbal. Historically viewed as commercially driven and somewhat insulated from the Chinese state, Hutchison’s posture has shifted under new geopolitical pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-hutchison-blackrock-deal-may-reduce-risk-for-the-united-states&quot;&gt;The Hutchison-BlackRock Deal May Reduce Risk for the United States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xmEoftG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s tightening grip on Hong Kong and the 2017 National Intelligence Law, which compels even private firms to cooperate with state intelligence efforts, have eroded assumptions about Hutchison’s independence. In several ports, Hutchison has also contracted with state-owned Chinese construction giants such as CHEC, suggesting Hutchison’s presence may pave the way for Beijing to deepen its foothold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2025, Hutchison announced plans to sell 43 of its overseas ports—including all seven LAC terminals—to a consortium led by U.S.-based BlackRock for $23 billion. In response, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation launched an antitrust review that could block or delay the deal. The agreement remains on uncertain footing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If completed, the sale could meaningfully reduce Beijing’s foothold in the region’s port infrastructure. However, there are signs that China may be using the spotlight on the Panama Canal ports to expand its broader footprint in the region. Recent reports indicate that the state-owned China Ocean Shipping Company is seeking to acquire a stake in the 43 ports currently up for sale, including key terminals in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vcXeJOc.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China’s influence in LAC maritime infrastructure is more widespread than previously reported, the United States, alongside regional partners, can take substantive steps to minimize risk at these ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support port buybacks and buyouts.&lt;/strong&gt; Recent developments suggest there is space for market-driven efforts to dilute China’s port footprint. Policymakers should explore ways to quietly support such efforts—particularly where they align with commercial interest and strategic value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assess and reduce strategic exposure.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should continue evaluating where its logistical and military interests most intersect with foreign-controlled ports in the Western Hemisphere. A more comprehensive understanding of exposure can help guide both policy planning and future risk mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen oversight and resilience at key ports.&lt;/strong&gt; Improving inspection protocols and increasing visibility into port operations can help reduce vulnerabilities. Quiet support to partner nations’ port authorities may offer a low-cost way to guard against surveillance, deter illicit activity, and mitigate China’s efforts to gain deeper strategic influence.&lt;/p&gt;

Complex regulations and persistent cultural challenges limit the partnerships and complicate U.S. defense sales.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the United States and its allies and partners face a more dangerous and uncertain world, the strategic imperative for cooperation has intensified. One of the greatest strengths of the United States has always been the nation’s connections with allies and partners. This is underpinned by robust defense industrial cooperation that strengthens partnerships, increases interoperability, and fills gaps in U.S. industrial capacity and capability. Working with allies offers an opportunity to surge production and contributes to deterrence. Yet despite the benefits, there are challenges that limit cooperation. Allies and partners can run into a wide range of regulatory hurdles and other barriers when buying from the United States and working with U.S. industry on codevelopment and coproduction. While certain military capabilities such as intelligence sharing may be achieved with a relatively narrow set of nations, defense industrial cooperation offers a way of building connections to a broader range of allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report takes a fresh look at the challenges of defense industrial cooperation through a direct survey of some of the United States’ closest industrial partners—those with a Reciprocal Defense Procurement Memorandum of Understanding (RDP MOU). These agreements relax provisions in the Buy American Act and allow foreign vendors to be considered domestic sources, granting the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) greater and easier access to ally and partner technologies and supply chains. The survey presented a range of questions on the reasons for and challenges to cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survey respondents confirmed that building domestic capacity, deterring threats, ensuring interoperability, and building regional capacity were all important goals, with building domestic capacity being their main interest. The Technology Security and Foreign Disclosure (TSFD) and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) were noted as particularly challenging processes when doing business with the United States, whether importing arms, codeveloping or coproducing defense goods, or transferring technologies. However, respondents also recognized that their home country processes added friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Document markings like Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals (NOFORN) were highlighted as challenges, with additional discussions revealing that the lack of clarity about how to dispute these markings was a source of frustration. RDP MOUs are widely acknowledged as being key facilitators for doing business with the United States, yet the exemptions they grant to participating countries are often not recognized by—or are even opposed by—U.S. program offices, U.S. congressional members, and the executive branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While none of these findings are particularly surprising, the survey’s sampling of respondents beyond just the United States’ largest and closest industrial partners confirmed that challenges are pervasive. It also offers an initial baseline against which the impact of future changes in policy can be measured. As the United States navigates a more precarious global order in which near-peer competitors are investing in and expanding the capacity of their own industrial bases, working with allies offers an effective way to strengthen partnerships and enhance deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Defense Industrial Cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense industrial cooperation offers participating nations many benefits. As a subset of broader security cooperation efforts, defense industrial cooperation strengthens alliances and partnerships by building the relationships integral to working together on research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and production; it also enhances military interoperability by encouraging the use of common platforms. A recent Defense Innovation Board report indicated that cooperation is increasingly important due to technological shifts: “The United States is no longer the leading source of progress across critical areas of defense-related technology innovation, such as 5G, hypersonics, and electronic warfare, while our allies and partners increasingly lead in other areas, including semiconductors, directed energy, and quantum science.” Cooperation is urgently required to ensure access to advanced technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation can improve supply chain resilience through the development of additional suppliers and can also grow domestic defense industries as they participate in joint efforts that may have the potential for additional customers. In a 2023 report, Jerry McGinn and Michael T. Roche connect a “build allied” approach to the realization of National Defense Strategy objectives, linking industrial cooperation with the strengthening of industrial base capacity and resilience. Working with the United States also offers opportunities to strengthen ties and benefit from advanced technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, any cooperation between nations with different priorities, political systems, funding cycles, and laws and regulations can be challenging to successfully accomplish. The desirability of working with the United States has led many nations to highlight the challenges of doing so. Some contractors have successfully solved the puzzle of U.S. bureaucracy, but red tape continues to create high barriers to entry for domestic as well as foreign industry. A few notable barriers include ITAR, TSFD, and Foreign Military Sales (FMS). These and other structural barriers are highlighted in this research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/17gKs8K.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ TABLE 2: U.S. Regulations and Processes for Defense Cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the breadth of the subject, it is useful to start by defining frameworks for cooperation as well as regulations that create challenges. Table 1 summarizes the frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These frameworks and supporting processes facilitate cooperation, but there are also a number of regulations and controls that make working together challenging. Table 2 lists the U.S. export and arms sales regulations used to manage technology transfer and safeguard U.S. technology. Table 2 also includes the processes that cover the delivery of defense products to partner nations, along with the markings that delineate limitations on allowing partners to access information relevant to cooperation. Several other processes are also described in more detail below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;value-of-improving-arms-sales&quot;&gt;Value of Improving Arms Sales&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streamlining the arms sales process is critical to advancing the goals of defense industrial cooperation. Reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies and accelerating delivery timelines ensures that partners receive the capabilities they need at the earliest opportunity. This strengthens alliances by reinforcing the United States’ standing as a reliable and responsible security partner. Efficient arms sales processes not only facilitate the fielding of U.S. platforms, weapons systems, and technologies to partner nations, but also ensure that the United States is reaping the benefits of technologies developed by partner states. This improves interoperability and reduces friction during multinational operations, enhancing coordination and force effectiveness in complex operating environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation through arms sales also bolsters supply chain resilience by integrating additional suppliers and production lines across allied and partner nations. Supply chain diversification reduces dependency on single-source suppliers, decreases risks associated with domestic supply chain bottlenecks, and ensures continuity during crises. Overcoming barriers to cooperation and improving the structure and execution of arms sales will enhance collective security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;notable-us-regulations&quot;&gt;Notable U.S. Regulations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International Traffic and Arms Regulations:&lt;/strong&gt; ITAR governs defense items and services to ensure that sophisticated military technology—such as items on the U.S. Munitions List (USML)—do not fall into the hands of U.S. adversaries or hostile actors. ITAR serves as the implementing framework for the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.SC. 2778), which is overseen by the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. ITAR is fundamental to safeguarding U.S. technologies and weapons systems, but may also create risks to U.S. and coalition military readiness. ITAR regulations have contributed to a risk-averse culture, engendering hesitancy in technology sharing even with close allies and partners. It prevents the United States from quickly proliferating advanced technologies to its friends and can impede U.S. warfighters from gaining access to advanced allied capabilities, as foreign companies sometimes desire to avoid ITAR processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology Security and Foreign Disclosure:&lt;/strong&gt; TSFD, similar in purpose to ITAR, manages the trade-offs between building allied capabilities and safeguarding national security. TSFD policies aim to balance the risks associated with sharing sensitive and highly classified U.S. technology and information with the benefits of international cooperation. Navigating TSFD processes, or “pipes,” is challenging yet necessary for engagement with friendly nations. U.S. industry is typically required to acquire TSFD approval prior to requesting export approval—a hurdle that strains program management offices and U.S. industry actors as they pursue international cooperation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Military Sales:&lt;/strong&gt; FMS is a process through which eligible foreign governments may purchase defense equipment and services from the U.S. government. FMS is a government-to-government process, whereas Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) is a commercial-to-government process. FMS is the largest U.S. security assistance program, aimed to help protect the economic health and security of allies and partners. The Department of State determines which countries are eligible for FMS, while DOD executes the programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an FMS program, the foreign government is responsible for all costs associated with the sale. Purchased items can either come from DOD stockpiles or from new procurement, wherein DOD enters a contract with a U.S. defense contractor to produce the items purchased. A single FMS case can contain hundreds of individual line items, span multiple commands and military departments, and take years or decades to fully deliver. FMS utilizes both Title 22 and Title 10 funds, each with its own set of rules. Some complex FMS programs require congressional review and approval, which can significantly delay the process. The threshold amount for a sale to require congressional oversight has not been adjusted in the last two decades, resulting in more cases undergoing congressional review than originally intended by the Arms Control Export Act (ACEA) established in 1976.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools to Overcome Challenges:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States has a variety of specific agreements with allies and partners to enhance defense industrial cooperation. The National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB) framework is aimed at enhancing collaboration in defense production, innovation, and supply chains with Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Security of Supply Arrangements (SOSA) are bilateral agreements allowing the United States and partner ministries of defense to request prioritized performance of contracts from one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RDP MOUs are designed to promote rationalization, standardization, and interoperability with ally and partner nations. They relax provisions from the Buy American Act of 1933 that direct the U.S. government to purchase supplies and finished goods domestically, requiring a waiver to buy internationally. RDP MOUs permit foreign industry to be considered domestic sources. They grant the United States and allied countries reciprocal access to their respective defense markets and streamline procurement processes to enhance effective defense cooperation and establish transparency and openness to competition. RDP MOUs generally contain similar provisions, such as increasing access to the other nation’s defense procurement system, “removing barriers to trade, providing reciprocal treatment to industrial enterprises of the other country, or waiving ‘buy national’ laws.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assessing-the-challenges-of-cooperation&quot;&gt;Assessing the Challenges of Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research on defense cooperation very often focuses on a narrow set of allies involved in substantial defense trade with the United States. To get a broader perspective, CSIS drew on RDP MOU-holding nations using a survey that sought to identify the challenges and enablers countries experience when doing business with the United States. Topics included selling arms to and receiving arms from the United States, U.S. export control policies, country-specific security and defense industrial goals, processes enabling technology transfer and weapons sales, and the utility of defense cooperation agreements and programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey was completed by representatives from member states of the Defense Memoranda of Understanding Military Attachés Group (DMAG), with the support of DMAG leadership. The DMAG is a group comprised of defense officials and attachés from countries who have RDP MOUs or equivalent agreements with the United States. As of 2025, 28 countries have RDP MOUs with the United States: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. Of these, 23 are members of NATO. Brazil, India, and South Korea are in ongoing RDP MOU negotiations with the United States. Given its DMAG “observer” status, South Korea was part of CSIS’s sample population. Brazil and India were not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirteen nations provided responses to the questions, and many offered additional optional comments. While survey responses were limited to one per country, that does not mean that each response was answered by only one country representative. In many cases, entire acquisition teams contributed to ensure the response reflected their country’s broader approach rather than individual perspectives. However, variability inevitably exists due to differences in participants’ experiences, expertise, and roles. As a result, while responses may represent national viewpoints, they should not be interpreted as official country positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been calls from experts in recent years to increase available data on the realized benefits and challenges that procurement agreements bring to U.S. allies and partners. This survey seeks to help fill this gap in quantitative information by offering a dataset on U.S. bureaucratic processes that facilitate—or hinder—defense industrial cooperation. The results also offer a baseline against which future policy changes can be assessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;allied-country-defense-industrial-priorities&quot;&gt;Allied Country Defense Industrial Priorities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survey recipients were asked to rate four key defense industrial cooperation goals on a scale of one to five—one being not important and five being extremely important. The goals listed were building domestic industry capacity, deterring the threat, ensuring interoperability, and developing regional capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All four goals were rated as at least important by all respondents; no participant rated any of the goals as either not important or somewhat important. Building domestic industry capacity, deterring the threat, and ensuring interoperability were rated as extremely important by most respondents, with nearly half rating developing regional capabilities as extremely important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense industrial cooperation priorities are directly linked to operational requirements, meaning that countries must ensure they can produce and sustain critical defense systems to meet their strategic needs. In some cases, this necessity leads countries to indigenize sovereign defense capabilities, even if this comes at the expense of international collaboration. As a result, respondents noted that investments may pivot away from cooperative efforts and toward developing domestic industries and capacity that can independently support long-term defense readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents from countries whose neighbors pose a direct threat to national security noted defense collaboration with allies as essential to extended deterrence. A strong and integrated defense industrial base strengthens deterrence posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oobOXSR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 1: Goals for Defense Industrial Cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A country’s size, natural resources, geographic location, and topography influence defense needs. Certain weapons systems or defense services are better suited to specific terrains—a landlocked country has less need to heavily invest in naval capabilities, for instance, and smaller countries with long coastlines may invest in advanced undersea capabilities and specialty systems. This creates a strong yet niche defense industrial base in specific domains, leading to strong dependencies on larger allies like the United States for key military platforms (such as fighter jets). Despite continued investment in domestic capabilities, allies with limited resources and specific geographies view regional and U.S. cooperation as a key supplement to defense industrial areas of national strategic importance. These allies may thus view the development of regional capabilities as more important than others that have more independent defense industrial bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legislative offsets were also noted as a priority among discussions with the DMAG and other defense acquisition stakeholders. Legislative offsets refer to the benefits—economic, industrial, or technological—that purchasing countries obtain by acquiring defense systems from the United States. These conditions of purchase pertain to both government-to-government sales and commercial sales of defense articles or services. There are multiple forms of potential compensation including “mandatory co-production, licensed production, subcontractor production, technology transfer, and foreign investment.” Certain U.S. allies and partners legally mandate offsets to ensure economic and industrial benefits when purchasing defense systems from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-export-control-challenges-and-enablers&quot;&gt;U.S. Export Control Challenges and Enablers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. export control processes have long been cited by allies and partners as complex, slow-moving, and opaque. These challenges can create uncertainty for foreign buyers, complicate defense cooperation procedures, and, in some extreme cases, incentivize partners to seek alternative suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survey respondents were asked to rate seven key U.S. export control processes on a scale of one to five—one being not challenging and five being very challenging. The seven processes listed were ITAR, Export Administration Regulations (EAR), Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), Excess Defense Articles (EDA), Technology Security and Foreign Disclosure (TSFD), and Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vI1MV1S.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 2: Persepectives on the Difficulty of U.S. Processes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in Figure 2, respondents deemed TSFD and ITAR to be among the most challenging hurdles to international procurement from the United States. No respondent rated any of these processes as not challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ITAR is a complex export control system marked by bureaucratic red tape, over which U.S. allies and partners continuously express frustration. ITAR processes are often perceived as too stringent and out of step with the current era of geopolitical competition, where delays in sharing equipment will limit the capabilities of allies. DMAG respondents recognized the purpose and importance behind ITAR but simultaneously critiqued its rigidity and prolonged lead times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because ITAR is such an expansive bureaucratic process, respondents noted that guidance from various U.S. authorities may be different or even conflicting. These barriers impede defense industrial cooperation and ultimately jeopardize U.S. and allied defense posture and readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ITAR does pose a significant challenge to international defense cooperation, it is part of a broader framework for partnerships. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), responsible for administering ITAR, plays a role in facilitating collaboration by reviewing, and then subsequently approving, export licenses. Through this process, the DDTC ensures that defense technologies are transferred in a controlled and responsible manner while simultaneously supporting codevelopment and coproduction efforts with international partners. ITAR helps balance national security concerns with opportunities for technological innovation and collaboration with partner nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some respondents offered additional nuance to their answers on TSFD and ITAR. TSFD can be relatively opaque—with a lack of clarity around which authorities do what and the pipeline of approval—but it is not always a very challenging process. The survey respondents felt that ITAR, by contrast, suffers from the opposite problem: It is a challenging process despite there being a considerable amount of information available on the steps required for compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wQcio00.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 3: Knowledge of ITAR Processes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents noted that even though key U.S. export control and technology transfer processes are viewed as at least somewhat challenging, that does not mean that they are wrong or misguided. There is an understanding among ally and partner nations that these regulations, though complex, exist for a reason. Allied nations have their own complex export control regimes that share the same objective as U.S. protection policies: to prevent sensitive technology and information from falling into the hands of unfriendly nations. There was no call by survey respondents to eliminate U.S. processes, but rather for a more transparent, streamlined system that, with predictable lead times, could enhance cooperation and benefits for both nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the difficulty of ITAR procedures and the various stakeholders involved, CSIS asked the DMAG how well they understand ITAR processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most—but not all—respondents understand ITAR processes moderately well. The DMAG respondents—defense cooperation attachés and defense officials—are familiar and relatively well versed in export control procedures by nature of their profession, so it may be of strategic concern for the United States that only four respondents reported a confident understanding of its requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States often is reluctant to let allies gain some of the benefits from arms cooperation. Specifically, foreign companies will set up production and development hubs in the United States both to manage output and not appear foreign to contracting officers who are partial to selecting domestic firms. As one of the survey respondents noted, “every product will be improved over time and new functions might be added. In this scenario the knowledge created in the U.S. subsidiary will not flow back to the mother company due to ITAR. This is not a problem for the company. But [it] reduces interoperability and interchangeability.” In these scenarios, ITAR restrictions prevent the knowledge, including technological upgrades or new capabilities at the U.S. subsidiary, from flowing back to the parent foreign company. While some companies prefer this practice to avoid “ITAR contamination,” it nevertheless can harm interoperability and interchangeability, as well as stifle the flow of innovation to allies’ defense industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6IngOSr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 4: Knowledge of FMS Processes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All respondents reported understanding FMS processes, in contrast to ITAR. Although FMS is not directly linked to international cooperation, as it primarily involves one nation’s government purchasing defense systems from the U.S. government, it serves an important role in helping nations achieve their domestic defense industrial goals. FMS enhances interoperability by allowing partner forces to operate using the same systems, and it can improve regional capabilities by equipping partner nations with advanced technologies that bolster their defense readiness. This serves to enhance deterrence posture, as partner nations are better equipped to defend against emerging threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FMS process can be complex and cumbersome, which is why the Defense Security Cooperation University offers foundational FMS courses that explore the essential components of military sales and transfers between the United States and partner nations. Students learn how to “plan, execute, and sustain the many complex and interrelated aspects of sales and transfers under the FMS program.”21 One survey respondent noted that certain FMS courses are no longer available for individuals in their office, meaning a growing number of foreign FMS officers lack a basic understanding of FMS processes in defense cooperation offices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When foreign defense attachés lack an adequate understanding of the FMS acquisition process, this knowledge gap not only impedes their home country’s ability to acquire U.S. defense systems efficiently but also negatively impacts the United States. Delays in the acquisition process, or even reduced purchases of U.S. defense systems, result in the United States exporting fewer defense products and providing fewer services, which reduces industry sales and hampers the ability of the United States to interoperate with its allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FMS is a complex process, and the literature on the topic indicates a variety of specific challenges. The survey included a question asking respondents to rate the challenges of a variety of FMS processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most respondents rated the lack of clarity and transparency as the most challenging aspect of the FMS system, closely followed by lengthy approval times and the multitude of U.S. stakeholders involved. Maintenance, repair, and overhaul delays are predominately viewed as moderately and extremely challenging. Most respondents rated equipment delays, regulatory compliance, and costs as moderately challenging. The costs associated with FMS were identified as the least challenging factor overall, despite the majority of respondents rating it as moderately challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yPaoJB7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 5: FMS Process Challenges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the optional written section, respondents noted a few other challenges that were not listed. First, long periods of time are required for case closure despite service completion. FMS case closure occurs when “all material has been delivered, services have been performed, other requirements of the [Letter of Offer and Acceptance] have been satisfied, known financial transactions (including collections) have been completed, and the purchaser receives a final statement of account.” Prompt case closure minimizes the amount of administrative effort required for an unnecessary open case, which diverts resources from other priorities. Prolonged case closure, a common frustration among primary FMS customers, delays the release of excess purchaser funds. This practice may erode the long-term willingness of partner nations to engage in the U.S. arms sales process, especially if certain materiel or systems can be purchased elsewhere. Secondly, survey respondents noted that a lack of workforce capacity within the defense industry can lead to increased costs for the production and delivery of defense systems. A workforce that does not meet demand may force partner nations to face higher prices and acquisition delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges with coordination were also noted, particularly a fragmented approach to working with allies. While the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) helps deliver integrated capabilities for the alliance, coordinating procurements between NATO members remains a perennial challenge. An acquisition approach that prioritizes national industry over greater NATO strategic priorities—coupled with the fact that the United States reviews FMS requests on a case-by-case basis—limits opportunities to optimize FMS outcomes for the broader defense goals of the alliance. Exploring whether there are groups of countries for which FMS cases can be reviewed together could streamline the process for the United States and speed acquisition by allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One respondent noted that borderline cases on occasion tended to linger as they were being reviewed, which the respondents felt was because of U.S. government hesitation to rapidly decline case requests, opting instead for extensive deliberations to provide alternatives. They suggested that sometimes a faster decision—even if it was negative—would be preferred because it would reduce uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1zwke1i.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 6: The Challenege of NOFORN and CUI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback from participants also raised the consideration that current thresholds for congressional notifications often hinder the efficiency of the export process. When the U.S. government plans to sell defense equipment, services, or technology to a foreign country, it must submit a notification to Congress if the sale exceeds a certain value, allowing lawmakers a designated period to review the proposed sale. However, a recent FMS task force discovered congressional notification thresholds have not been updated since FY 2003 despite a DOD inflation rate of 69 percent since then. This means routine and standardized exports to friendly nations—often NATO partners—are often stuck waiting for Congressional approval, creating unnecessary delays and administrative burdens. Had thresholds been adjusted for inflation, 14 out of 123 sales, or 11 percent, in 2023 alone would not have required a waiting period. The task force recommended Congressional notification thresholds be updated to reflect inflation to avoid more sales being subject to congressional review than originally intended. Otherwise, sales that are neither sophisticated nor strategically sensitive can become backlogged, slowing down the acquisition process without significantly enhancing oversight or national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge of U.S. categorization of information as Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals (NOFORN) or controlled unclassified information (CUI) was consistently mentioned as a barrier throughout the duration of the study in both discussions and survey responses. These categorizations can create barriers to foreign partners’ access to information and can hinder procurement and coproduction processes. These restrictions can lead to delays in equipment delivery and licensing processes and may negatively impact interoperability between allied forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents noted that NOFORN and CUI limit the ability of foreign contractors to compete for opportunities. In some cases, information marked CUI or NOFORN is not made available to foreign bidders in time for them to properly develop a bid. While this may increase U.S.-made technology, it may also result in the DOD not accessing best-in-class technical solutions. Reforming protectionist policies demands not only regulatory change, but cultural change to support systematic alteration in the way the DOD approaches classification markings. While the use of NOFORN to obstruct competition is illegal, respondents felt that the classification remained overused and thus impeded cooperative defense industrial efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents also noted that Master Information Exchange Agreements (MIEAs) and subordinate Information Exchange Annexes (IEAs) are extremely useful. MIEAs establish a reciprocal, balanced exchange of R&amp;amp;D between participating parties and authorize specified IEAs. IEAs enables the exchange of R&amp;amp;D data pertaining to specific technology or weapons development areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ally-and-partner-nation-export-control-challenges-and-enablers&quot;&gt;Ally and Partner Nation Export Control Challenges and Enablers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge that regulations represent is not unique to the United States. Every nation has its own individual export control and technology transfer difficulties. Figure 7 reports that most respondents believe working with the United States is no different or harder than working with other nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is also the sole supplier of a number of advanced capabilities. This makes cooperation with the United States—and an understanding of its export control processes—mandatory for those who wish to acquire certain U.S.-designed and -produced weapons systems. And it means that U.S. regulations have an outsized impact on partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. allies and partners have their own set of export control and technology transfer processes that can hinder—but also enable—information sharing and arms sales. Survey respondents had varying perceptions of their home countries’ export control processes, but they provided useful feedback on what mechanisms could help their own international procurement processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 8 provides an illustration of respondents’ view of their own countries’ export control regimes. Most respondents were neutral or in agreement with the statement that their home country export control and technology transfer policies enable procurement processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 8: Assessment of Home Country Export Control Enablers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 9 shows respondents were reasonably mixed on whether their own export controls pose a significant challenge to doing business with the United States, but only three agreed that the challenge was also on their side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To gain further insight into respondents’ perspectives on their home countries’ export controls, CSIS also asked whether their domestic export controls generate “friction”—something less than a “significant challenge”—for their procurement and cooperation processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 10 shows that most respondents were likely to agree that their export control and technology transfer policies add friction to procurement and cooperation processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kMOWDyN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURES 9 &amp;amp; 10: Assessment of Home Country Export Control Challenges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS asked respondents to rate certain processes and agreements based on how beneficial they would be to facilitating defense trade with the United States, with the results reported in Figure 11. The survey asked about the Defense Production Act (DPA), the trilateral security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (AUKUS), reclassifying items from the USML to the Commerce Control List (CCL), and the National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB). There was agreement among respondents that most of these initiatives would be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Nw2ECDk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 11: What Could Make Trade Easier?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense Production Act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being considered a domestic source under the DPA was rated among the most beneficial options by respondents. The DPA, passed in 1950, grants the president the authority to influence domestic industry and expand and expedite certain materiel required for national defense during emergency mobilizations. Domestic industry may be called upon to expand the production and supply of materiel critical to national security or emergencies. In 2020, President Trump utilized the DPA to order General Motors to produce more ventilators during the Covid-19 pandemic, and during his second term, he is using it to ramp up domestic critical minerals production to reduce foreign dependencies on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Title III of the DPA, the Expansion of Productive Capacity and Supply, authorizes “incentives to include loans, loan guarantees, direct purchases and purchase commitments, and the authority to procure and install equipment in private industrial facilities.” Canada has been considered a domestic source since 1992, and the FY 2024 National Defense Authorization Act designated the United Kingdom and Australia also as domestic sources eligible for DPA funds. This means Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom enjoy U.S. government benefits when they are able to provide essential defense materials and goods under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the DPA includes Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom as domestic sources, the degree to which the U.S. government can direct a foreign firm to produce under the DPA is more nuanced than it is with a purely domestic firm. Title I of the DPA authorizes the government to prioritize federal contracts that support certain national defense and energy programs. The Department of Commerce administers this authority through the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) regulation. DPAS applies to all entities physically in the United States, regardless of foreign or domestic ownership. However, foreign companies and foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies that are not physically located in the United States fall outside DPAS jurisdiction. Thus, while foreign firms considered domestic sources are eligible to receive financial incentives from the U.S. government to surge production, the United States also needs to work through diplomatic channels to encourage a reliable supply of critical goods during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there is a distinction between being considered a domestic source under the DPA and having an RDP MOU with the United States. The latter ensures allied and partner industries are considered domestic sources, waiving obstacles associated with the Buy American Act and facilitating smoother access to U.S. defense contracts. Domestic sources under the DPA, by contrast, are utilized during times of national crisis, as firms are incentivized—and ordered—to produce a certain amount of goods or materiel necessary for national security or during emergencies. This serves as a mechanism to rapidly mobilize the defense industrial base to ensure the United States has access to vital resources when traditional free-market forces are not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Agreement Similar to AUKUS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AUKUS is a trilateral security partnership initiated in 2021 between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It is designed to promote information sharing and technology transfer, as well as to better integrate and diversify security-related supply chains and industrial bases. AUKUS has two pillars, the first supporting the Royal Australian Navy’s acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines. The second pillar is focused on cooperation in advanced technologies, including cyber, artificial intelligence, quantum, and undersea capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To implement these two pillars, harmonized procurement strategies between AUKUS member nations were required. Once Australia’s and the United Kingdom’s defense information protection systems were aligned with that of the United States—a process that involved strengthening cybersecurity measures and harmonizing classification standards—information sharing and technology transfer were simplified. This was reflected in the revisions made in the EAR and ITAR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2024, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amended the EAR to facilitate license-free trade with Australia and the United Kingdom in furtherance of AUKUS objectives. It removed certain “license requirements, expanded the availability of license exemptions, and reduced the scope of end-use and end-user-based license requirements for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) to or within Australia and the United Kingdom.” The BIS estimates that $7.5 billion annually in trade with Australia and the United Kingdom will no longer be subject to these previous license regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) made similar changes to ITAR that enable the license-free transfer of commercial defense trade for Australia and the United Kingdom. With certain limitations, authorized users within AUKUS member states require no license or other approval for “export, reexport, retransfer, or temporary import of defense articles, the performance of defense services, or engaging in brokering activities.” This rule also allows for an expedited export licensing process for defense articles or services to Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One DMAG participant likened AUKUS membership to having a “fast pass” or “carpool lane” through ITAR that streamlines defense cooperation with the United States. However, for other nations seeking privileges comparable to those enjoyed by Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, reform is necessary not only within the U.S. system but also within those countries’ domestic frameworks. Certain nations expressed a desire to be a part of AUKUS’s second pillar, even with only specific technologies like hypersonic, missile, or undersea capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving Items from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ITAR governs the USML, which details defense-related articles, services, and technologies designated as critical to U.S. national security. The DDTC, within the U.S. Department of State, is responsible for administering ITAR. The DDTC must approve export licenses for items on the USML to prevent U.S. adversaries from obtaining advanced technologies critical to U.S. military advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCL is a list of dual-use items that have military but also commercial applications. The EAR, enforced by the BIS within the U.S. Department of Commerce, governs the CCL. Items on the CCL are typically less restricted than their counterparts on the USML and only sometimes require a license (unlike items on the USML list, which always do). CCL items requiring licenses include sensitive technologies such as semiconductors and aerospace components. Moving items from the USML to the CCL was offered as an underrated solution to the complexity of U.S. procurement procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Technology Industrial Base&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NTIB is an agreement between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States that establishes joint national security and dual-use R&amp;amp;D initiatives as well as production- and maintenance-related activities. While some survey respondents offered that the NTIB has the potential to be extremely beneficial, they noted that it has done little more than enable limited information exchange. The NTIB lacks funding and does not change standing policy, which limits the ability to improve defense industrial cooperation processes. It does not address the regulatory complexities baked into various export control regimes—such as ITAR, EAR, FMS, the Canadian ITAR waiver for unclassified goods control, and the Australia-UK Defense Trade Treaties—to which foreign companies are subject. Ensuring compliance with these various regulations requires “an army of lawyers and clerks, burning up a significant amount of resources.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;benefits-of-cooperation&quot;&gt;Benefits of Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason nations seek to engage in defense industrial cooperation with the United States is to “uplift” their domestic industries. Selling to the United States was viewed as extremely important to home country industry by all but one of CSIS’s survey respondents, as shown in Figure 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings are unsurprising given that the United States has the largest arms market in the world, making it a critical enabler of partner nation industrial development strategy. Beyond the sheer size of the U.S. market, there are other advantages as well. Selling to the United States serves as a forcing function for nations to align their modular standards to those of the United States, making the latter more likely to be a steady customer for domestically produced defense products and services. If partner nations build using operating systems that are compatible with those of the United States, the option to export these products to the United States will always be available. This allows partner nations to deploy systems that are interoperable with U.S. ones, strengthening coalition and joint operation efforts. Additionally, the United States acts in good faith to honor agreements and reciprocally provides high-quality, dependable, and compatible defense products and services to partner nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other factors, however, make the United States a less valued customer. Survey respondents noted that they could feel compelled to purchase from elsewhere if newly developed capabilities were made available by European Union member states or other allied nations, especially if those countries’ export and technology transfer policies were easier to navigate. During the discussion roundtable, participants mentioned that a drastic shift in U.S. trade policy with punitive tariff measures could lead them to consider other sources when acquiring defense capabilities. Countries also face pressure to spend domestically, as investing in internal capabilities and capacity leads to a more independent and indigenized industrial base. These incentives may include the desire to foster local innovation, reduce reliance on foreign suppliers, decrease unemployment rates by boosting job opportunities, and develop and maintain technologies critical for safeguarding national security. Other respondents noted the importance of speed—an oft-cited shortcoming of allied procurement of U.S. systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defense-cooperation-agreements-and-programs&quot;&gt;Defense Cooperation Agreements and Programs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of defense cooperation agreements and programs that serve to enhance defense industrial cooperation and more easily facilitate arms sales and technology transfer. These include RDP MOUs, NATO membership, SOSAs, Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT), Reciprocal Government Quality Assurance (QA) Agreements, Major Non-NATO Ally Status, and Defense Exportability Features (DEF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FvznCYi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 13: Value of Different Kinds of Agreements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked to rate defense cooperation agreements and programs by the degree to which each benefits their home country’s ability to do business with the United States. RDP MOUs were most favored, with nine respondents rating them as extremely beneficial and the other four rating them as moderately beneficial. It should be noted that this may be a case of selection bias, since potential respondents were identified because they are part of an organization comprised of countries that hold RDP MOUs, and thus the sample that chose to respond to the survey may be more invested in such agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second to RDP MOUs, the defense cooperation aspects of NATO were positively viewed by all survey respondents. NATO has a set of programs enabling nations to work together on acquisition. Several joint acquisition programs exist, including NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance, NATO Sea Sparrow Consortium, and NATO Multinational Multi Role Tanker and Transport Fleet. In 2021, NATO established the Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA) to integrate and deliver new technologies to NATO forces. DIANA primarily focuses on “big data, artificial intelligence (AI), autonomy, quantum, biotechnologies and human enhancement, energy and propulsion, novel materials and advanced manufacturing and aerospace.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP) allows allies to harmonize their force and capability planning activities. The NDPP facilitates the interoperability of allied forces and ensures that they are properly equipped and supported to undertake missions without compromising the readiness of national militaries. Additionally, the NDPP is responsible for identifying requirements for NATO forces and supports capability development and acquisition. The NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) delivers capabilities, logistics support, and procurement frameworks to member nations and supports weapons system life-cycle management. Despite the cited benefits that accompany NATO membership, survey participants still widely cited joint procurement challenges. One respondent noted that internationally acquiring weapons independently is not so difficult, but rather “the challenge is to coordinate procurements between allies to make NATO as strong as possible in our region.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOSAs, which allow the United States and participating nations to request priority supply of defense goods and services, were viewed by the survey respondents as generally beneficial. For instance, the United States can request foreign industry to prioritize delivery under DOD contracts, subcontracts, or orders. And vice versa: They ensure partner nations are prioritized when supply shortages or geopolitical tensions arise. SOSAs allow for streamlined procurement processes, and foreign vendors located in countries with an established SOSA may be viewed more favorably by U.S. program offices. However, SOSAs are voluntary or “best effort” frameworks, and their main purpose is confidence building. They are not binding international agreements that obligate signatories to invoke the terms of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FCT program allows the United States to satisfy its defense needs more quickly and cost efficiently by testing the technologies developed by allies and partners with high technology readiness levels, thus better equipping U.S. forces and satisfying U.S. defense needs. This accelerates U.S. government acquisition from foreign industry, circumventing traditional acquisition pathways that typically include domestic capability development and lengthy and costly R&amp;amp;D investments. Through FCT, the United States can test partner nation technologies, capabilities, and weapon systems prior to procuring their systems, following a “try before you buy” model. This approach allows roughly a third of foreign vendors to either directly partner with U.S. industry or, at the very least, establish a U.S. presence. As of January 2024, 1,297 technologies from partner nations were assessed, and U.S. forces acquired 307 of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has QA agreements with six countries: the Czech Republic, Finland, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and South Korea. QA agreements ensure defense products and services meet U.S. military specifications through a set of standardized procedures for testing, inspection, and certification. This reduces the risk of defective parts in critical defense systems; it also streamlines defense procurement processes, as products certified under nations who have a QA are more readily accepted by the United States and its partners who share interoperability standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DEF is the practice of encouraging DOD program management to design and develop exportability features early in a program’s life cycle. This can facilitate exports by incorporating technology protection earlier in the design process to avoid expensive retrofits as well as costly and time-consuming redesigns to meet export control and partner-specific requirements. DEF facilitates business with the United States by making U.S. defense systems more export-friendly, reducing costs for foreign buyers, and improving interoperability with allies and partners. DEF also simplifies FMS processes by pre-engineering exportable versions of systems, reducing delays caused by technology transfer restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges-of-rdp-mous&quot;&gt;Challenges of RDP MOUs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the intent of RDP MOUs may be to facilitate defense trade, many of the survey respondents expressed that U.S. government stakeholders were less supportive of RDP MOUs’ function. Most respondents did not find the “Buy American” exemptions to be well recognized within program offices, as shown in Figure 14. Furthermore, Figure 15 shows that about half of the respondents found acquisition program offices to be leery of the Buy American exemptions they offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 14 shows that the overwhelming majority of respondents agree or strongly agree that the exemption of Buy American provisions is not well recognized in some U.S. program offices. Two are neutral, while none reported disagreement or strong disagreement. Figure 15 shows that survey respondents are either neutral, agree, or strongly agree that U.S. program offices are cautious regarding exemptions granted in RDP MOUs. Once again, no one disagreed or strongly disagreed. There are a variety of potential reasons for this. There may be misconceptions among acquisition contracting officers as to what exactly RDP MOUs are. Respondents suspected that program offices find it easier to default to purchasing U.S. goods and services. As one interviewee noted, “no one gets fired for buying American.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 National Defense Industrial Strategy fails to mention RDP MOUs, demonstrating a lack of awareness and understanding of the benefits RDP MOUs provide to the United States. However, there have been welcome changes made in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), which is responsible for implementing RDP MOU exemptions. In recent years, DFARS has become more inclusive of RDP MOU provisions and has more systematically integrated these agreements into the broader defense acquisition framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/n1JukbF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ FIGURE 16: How Partners Think Congress and the Executive Branch View RDP MOUs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Figure 16, participants generally were neutral or in agreement that Congress and the executive branch are opposed to the exemptions granted in RDP MOUs. Congressional debates are frequently centered on protecting U.S. industry, without recognizing that these international agreements consider signatory country defense industrial bases as complementary to, rather than competitive with, U.S. defense manufacturing. This may lead legislators to undermine the cooperative defense industrial relationships that enhance mutual security capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;insights-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Insights and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the survey demonstrates, there is room for improvement in defense industrial cooperation and communication between the United States and RDP MOU nations. Arms sales and technology transfer play a large role in ensuring the United States and its allies are properly equipped to build competitive advantage. Easing restraints on both sides, that is, both U.S. and allied processes, will serve to bolster deterrence in the face of a growing alliance between adversarial nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a compelling business case to be made for deeper U.S. defense industrial base integration with allies and partners. Integration extends beyond traditional arms sales and technology transfers to include codevelopment and coproduction. While these collaborative ventures can be complex and often require higher up-front investment, they offer long-term financial benefits by creating economies of scale and ultimately reducing per-unit costs. Additionally, deeper defense industrial collaboration positions the United States to profit from arms sales to partner nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS’s survey found that countries with an RDP MOU with the United States are hopeful that the agreement will help uplift their own industrial bases through increased cooperation and sales. However, a lack of consistency across administrations was identified as a limit; one survey respondent noted that “As the government changes every four years, new policies such as the National Defense Industrial Strategy . . . often momentum. Therefore, a defense industry cooperation policy that can be sustainably kept is needed.” There is a persistent tension in the United States between Buy American regulations and industrial cooperation. This tension has only grown with the Trump administration’s focus on tariffs as an instrument of economic policy. Every U.S. administration should remember the benefits of cooperation—which can include increased sales, closer ties, and enhanced interoperability—in the face of pressure to onshore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following set of recommendations will serve to ease arms sales and technology transfer between the United States and partner nations, help allies achieve their domestic defense industrial priorities, enhance interoperability to strengthen coalition operations, and bolster production diplomacy to counteract the defense industrial capabilities of U.S. adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Combine review of weapons requests from allies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Export controls should not be eliminated, but rather reengineered. President Trump’s April 9, 2025, Executive Order on Foreign Military Sales highlights the goal of the reduction of barriers to export weapons to allies, and there are a number of alternatives. For instance, every bilateral arrangement requires a separate review, even if two close allies are buying the same equipment. Throughout the Congressional Notification process, past approvals don’t seem to hold merit when reviewing FMS requests. While Australia, Israel, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine receive preferential treatment in various aspects of U.S. defense sales, there is no further FMS distinction between a NATO ally or a country with a minimal defense relationship with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Allies working as a group to procure U.S. systems, or the United States combining reviews, could be structural solutions to speed the process. Creating a joint structure for FMS reviews is another option. While extensive deliberation between Congress and the executive branch would be required to create “bins” for allies, countries that hold an RDP MOU would be a good place to start. A smaller trial subset could be Canada and AUKUS participants. Note that addressing export control friction would not only enhance arms exports, but also enable the codevelopment and coproduction that would underpin the expansion of partner industrial bases, helping strengthen forward deterrence and opportunities for surge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Periodically review export controls and classification markings.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Periodic reviews of export control and classification marking policies would be useful to ensure that they are appropriately limiting technology proliferation without causing undue delays and complications. Export controls, while critical to safeguard U.S. technologies, are not prepared to meet the challenges of the current geopolitical moment. Institutionalized, systematic reviews of export control regimes, such as ITAR, TSFD, and EAR, along with sales mechanisms, like FMS and DCS, can help ensure the United States can get weapons and technologies to its friends at speed and scale. These reviews should include a close review of technologies on the USML to see if any are eligible to be placed on the CCL, which is governed by a less restrictive process. Similarly, document markings, such as CUI and NOFORN, should be carefully managed to ensure that they do not needlessly limit cooperation, along with allied industry insight into DOD tenders. Reviews should also take care to ensure CUI and NOFORN labels are intentional and justified, rather than automatic, default practices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Close the ally and partner knowledge gap of U.S. processes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Allies and partners have an incomplete understanding of U.S. government regulations—including DMAG participants. Given these individuals play an important role in enhancing bilateral defense cooperation, this knowledge gap may lead to unnecessary delays in international arms acquisitions. Formal training offered by the United States is a low-cost solution to help facilitate arms sales, technology transfer, and defense industrial cooperation. Additionally, a coherent understanding of U.S. processes in foreign program offices does not singularly benefit U.S. allies, but engaging with a well-informed partner workforce helps speed acquisitions and lower bureaucratic inefficiencies. This means the United States can sell systems, components, and services faster, and thus provide a more stable demand signal to U.S. industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Offer RDP MOU training to U.S. program offices.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Survey respondents were consistent in their feedback that RDP MOUs are not particularly well understood in U.S. program offices. This limits the DOD’s ability to draw on the expertise of allies. A recent Defense Innovation Board report addressed this directly, suggesting that “all DOD program managers should be trained on the RDP MOU and additional Buy American waivers and exemptions. In addition, the office that negotiates these waivers must be empowered to inform and educate the DOD contracting and acquisition workforce on the proper use of these existing authorities.” Continual education for relevant parties and government organizations as part of required acquisition certifications would address this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design for exportability to facilitate defense trade.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, Defense Exportability Features (DEF) is the practice of encouraging DOD program management to design and develop exportability features early in a program’s life cycle. A key facilitator of DEF is Modular Open Systems Approaches (MOSA). MOSA is a strategy for designing an adaptable system that employs interfaces that any authorized vendor, including a foreign vendor, can use to integrate and operate together. This standardization enables U.S. allies and partners to “plug-and-play” by incorporating technology from a variety of sources into one loosely coupled but standardized system. MOSA allows for the easy removal of modules that contain classified technology or the replacement of U.S.-specific modules with those that directly address allied needs. This eases the export control process by circumventing expensive retrofits and time-consuming redesigns to safeguard sensitive technology. Additionally, MOSA serves to enforce standards setting, which facilitates interoperability and alleviates challenges inherent to coalition operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop and support institutional frameworks to enhance exports and encourage cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To enhance defense industrial cooperation, the United States should develop and expand institutional mechanisms that facilitate export exemptions and industrial collaboration. Expanding these types of arrangements benefits not only allies but also the United States given the reduced pressure on domestic manufacturing during crises and improved access to foreign-produced defense goods in peacetime and when urgently needed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom highlight that ITAR and EAR waivers remain limited in scope and difficult to obtain, they still serve as a valuable benchmark for other allies to work toward. The United States should pursue efforts to review whether allied nations qualify for ITAR exemptions and domestic source designation under the DPA. Moreover, while RDP MOUs carry certain risks for signatory nations, like potential market saturation by U.S. firms, the benefits—such as reciprocal access to each other’s defense markets—can outweigh the drawbacks. The United States should continue to engage allies and partners to increase the number of RDP MOUs and SOSAs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-way-forward&quot;&gt;The Way Forward&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more precarious global order in which near-peer competitors are investing in and expanding the capacity of their own industrial bases will necessitate working with allies to effectively strengthen partnerships and increase deterrence. To enhance defense industrial cooperation, allies and partners—including the United States—should increase information sharing about their domestic defense industrial priorities. Allies and partners must take a close inventory of their own defense industrial bases and evaluate what they seek to buy off-the-shelf from the United States and/or coproduce and codevelop with the United States. Without this information, the United States will be less able to conduct long-term defense industrial planning and be less responsive to ally and partner needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limited defense industrial cooperation between the United States and its allies contributes to vulnerabilities that adversaries can exploit to wield their influence across the global strategic landscape. The United States alone is not prepared to ramp up production to meet current demand in the near term, and some capabilities may take a decade or longer to build. Without an integrated defense industrial base, the United States and its allies will be less effective in the development, production, and sustainment of critical military capabilities—and will ultimately struggle to fight together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been an eventful few weeks for Russia. An unprecedented and innovative Ukrainian drone attack targeting airfields deep inside Russia; more negotiations with the Americans in Istanbul; the detonation of the annexed Crimea Bridge; its involvement in the Israel-Iran war, and the publication of the UK’s Strategic Defence Review (SDR), calling Russia an “immediate and pressing threat” to British national security. Although some of these are more important than others in Moscow’s eyes, they raise questions about Russia’s perceptions of security matters, and in particular how they interpret the threat from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Russia indeed poses one of the most significant threats to British national security, then it is worth trying to get under the skin of how the Russians see us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;immediate-reactions&quot;&gt;Immediate Reactions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, the SDR’s publication was met with a mixture of derision and caution in Russia. Several members of Russia’s upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, maintained dismissively that the UK is not capable of being part of the “geopolitical troika” – referring to the US, Russia and China, countries that are considered to have greater international and military clout – commentators were variously suggesting that Russia has been made an outsize enemy as a ruse to justify UK military spending or to detract from domestic concerns, and that without the US’s support, the UK’s military footprint is small. The State Duma (lower house of parliament) was similarly dismissive and played down the prospect of preparation for future war with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this was not uniform. Other commentators in Kremlin-affiliated media went further, maintaining that the UK has expansionist designs on the Black Sea, aiming to expand its own sphere of influence – something that Russia itself does. Indeed, some dissenting voices in Russia suggested Moscow take seriously the UK’s announcement, as it takes a position that other countries such as France and Germany are increasingly adopting against Russia. Perhaps most concerningly, the headline takeaway in Moscow appears to be that the UK is “secretly” planning for a future direct military conflict with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More so than words, Russia’s actions towards the UK following the SDR were revealing. First, Russia swiftly designated the British Council as an “undesirable organisation”, effectively halting all their educational activities in Russia. Although the Council has largely been barred from operating since the war began, the symbolic designation carried with it the claim that the Council has been a foil for British intelligence in Russia. Indeed, it gave significant airtime to the Council’s widespread intelligence activities, including allegations of attempting to foment unrest among the Baltic states against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, a few days later, the SVR (foreign service) on 5 June published a lengthy treatise on its website on the UK’s policy towards Georgia – mostly on the UK’s involvement with the opposition, NGOs and activism – and its alleged subversive activities. The SVR’s media page is not especially /span&amp;gt;prolific and tends to reprint speeches, occasional war updates or criticisms of notable western officials. It is therefore less than coincidental that the SVR has chosen to publish its criticism of the UK at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all of these various reactions to the SDR highlight in some way the paradoxical and highly contradictory nature of Moscow’s relationship with London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-they-see-us&quot;&gt;How Do They See Us?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has a long and varied history with the UK, marred most obviously in recent years by Russia’s various wars and intelligence operations on British soil. Prior to Trump’s resumption of office, Russia’s narratives of the UK could be divided into three broad and sometimes contradictory strokes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is Russia’s rather dismissive branding of “perfidious Albion” as an outmoded puppet of the US, and a country with limited international heft. Russia’s understanding of the way it sees the world is most clearly expressed in its Foreign Policy Concept, published in 2023 amid the war. There, it refers to the UK as part of the “Anglo-Saxon” world – a purposeful reference to an extinct civilisation which tallies with Russian ideas of the decline of the West (and the concomitant rising of Russia’s own star).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is mentioned in a somewhat throwaway paragraph entitled “the US and other Anglo-Saxon states”, drawing a power distinction between Washington, and those who are seen as in its pockets. Indeed, there is an entire section dedicated to Russia’s rumination of its relationship with the US, despite it’s so called “anti-Russian policy” and a mere sentence referring to other “Anglo Saxon” countries. This definition is unclear – it seems to be rather liberally used to refer to some European countries as well – but the sentiment is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Russia sees the world in terms of who has power and who does not, it was evident that Russia does not consider the UK to be on a par with itself, China or the US – the “geopolitical troika” referred to above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This narrative runs alongside but not necessarily counter to Russia’s second narrative, of the UK as a provider of occasionally desirable assets. Russia’s practical interests in the UK’s real estate sector, capitalisation on illicit flows through the UK’s banking system; admiration of the British schooling system, and access to gold standard institutions such as British contract law are well established. The UK’s perceived international relevance does not negate Russia’s patronage of certain institutions that can further some of Russia’s interests abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is the third and similarly contradictory strategy, which is that while maintaining the UK’s supreme irrelevance, Russia appears to invest some resources in its intelligence penetration of the UK, as well as showcasing Russia’s aerial and naval capabilities close to British waters and airspace with relative frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A corollary of this is that Russia appears to expend a fair amount of media resources into criticising the UK’s “Russophobic” stance and framing it as a country focused on undermining Russia and its development. According to this narrative, the UK occupies a space in an international system designed to keep Russia out of what Moscow perceives to be its rightful domain in international affairs. This perception likely increases the UK’s attractiveness as an intelligence target, as well as our relationship with the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing-russian-narratives&quot;&gt;Testing Russian Narratives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if the above narrative strings were the basis of Russia’s understanding of the UK, since the war and Trump and Starmer’s respective terms of office, they have become harder for Russia to sustain, and so they have perceptibly shifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, President Trump’s perceived pullback from NATO, admonishment of the European states over their spending, and apparent echoing of some of Russia’s security concerns, as well as his willingness to entertain the Russian position, have all forced Moscow to draw much more of a distinction between US and UK foreign policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this vein, much of the media reaction to the SDR has focused on Moscow’s perception of the UK as luring the US into an open war with Russia. This is not just confined to the media. Political heavyweights such as Nikolai Patrushev, formerly head of the Security Council and now a presidential aide and head of the Maritime Board, which is involved with maritime security and Arctic development, have in recent months made public distinctions between the US and what they refer to as the “European wing of NATO”, led by London. A growing narrative is instead that London is seeking to subvert the nascent dialogue between Moscow and Washington, and it is Trump who is walking back from an outright war with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the head of the SVR in March 2025 issued an unusually focused and charged statement about the UK, accusing London of undermining Trump’s negotiating stance with Russia; highlighting the UK’s weakness without the US, and going as far as to refer to the UK as the main instigator of global conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the UK’s spearheading of the Coalition of the Willing appears to have somewhat wrongfooted the Russians. Consecutive Conservative governments and their stance on Russia were a known entity for Moscow, but Starmer’s continuation of military aid to Ukraine, boosting of UK defence spending and careful rhetoric around Trump (that does not go as far as criticising US negotiations with the Russians), are all surprising elements for Russia’s understanding of how a Labour government operates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starmer’s role in bringing together European countries against Russia prompted some Russian officials to describe the UK as the “locomotive that pulls the rest of the [countries] with it”. All of this is a stark departure from the UK’s perceived international irrelevance and runs directly counter to Russia’s view that the UK does not have an independent foreign policy from the US. This has unseated Russia’s narrative of a UK that has little international clout, with deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko maintaining the UK, France and Germany are responsible for the slowing down of peace negotiations on the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Russia’s domestic security scene has changed, and with it, Russia’s perception of what constitutes an “enemy”. Throughout 2024, a series of IS-affiliated terrorist attacks have occurred within Russia since the war began, either due to a lack of preventative resources, or because the security services have prioritising targeting Russia’s political opposition, instead of addressing the terrorist threat. The most unusual element is not the domestic intelligence failures, but the Russian branding of enemies such as the UK as behind some of its most serious attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the Crocus City Hall terrorist attack in March 2024, where almost 150 people were killed by gunmen professing allegiance to IS, Alexander Bortnikov, head of the FSB, publicly maintained that while the perpetrators may have been linked to IS, the true masterminds behind the attack were the UK, the US and Ukraine. In reality, this did not have any material impact on the FSB’s investigation of the true perpetrators, and resources were not expunged on identifying any serious link to the UK. But the narrative of an outsize threat to Russia, posed by an apparently irrelevant and powerless political entity, that nevertheless had the resources and interests in destabilising the country, is difficult to square with official understandings of where the UK sits in Russia’s power ranking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SVR has a journal called Razvedchik (intelligence officer) and while its readership might be small, the articles they choose to run with are revealing. In one of its most recent publications, Razvedchik released “declassified” intelligence documents alleging the British foreign service had attempted in 2024, in conjunction with the US, to attack Russian bases in Syria, with the aim of destabilising the region more broadly. While this is unlikely to be credible, it is further evidence of a contradictory framing of the UK as both an international irrelevance, but also the driving force behind the destabilisation of countries in which Russia has interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For information purposes, these mutually exclusive narratives can all be folded into a broader picture of what constitutes Russia’s understanding of the UK, which can be multifaceted and inconsistent. But they also point to a more concerning lack of insight on Moscow’s part, and perhaps a lack of clarity on the UK’s part – about what the UK’s intentions are towards countries Russia has a particular focus on; about how foreign policymaking works in the West, and why the UK has become a euphemistic bogeyman, along with the rest of the “collective West”, to account for Russia’s own failings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most pressingly, this collection of views suggests changes of leadership will not be sufficient to move the dial on Moscow’s relations with London.&lt;/p&gt;

The Iranian General Staff announced a shift from “deterrent” strikes to “punitive” operations — an escalation prompted by Israel’s ongoing offensive, launched on June 13, which officially targets Iran’s nuclear program but has eliminated key military commanders and destroyed air defense systems.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Israel appears to be aiming for the collapse of the Iranian state, though it’s unclear how long it can sustain such an effort on its own. Meanwhile, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) — the backbone of the clerical regime — has been weakened and discredited. Israeli intelligence networks have reportedly penetrated deep inside Iran’s state and military institutions, and Khamenei himself may no longer be receiving accurate reports on the situation. Still, the regime could seek to regain public support by deploying nationalist rhetoric and making political concessions. According to Antonio Giustozzi of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), the future of the Islamic Republic hinges on Tehran’s ability to adapt to this new phase of war.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the stated aim of Israel’s attack on Iran is to destroy Tehran’s nuclear programme, its main initial success on June 12-13 was the decapitation of Iran’s military: both the Commander of the IRGC and the chief of staff of the Iranian army were killed, together with several other senior military commanders. The damage to Iran’s air defences was also so extensive that they might now be completely unserviceable, but this makes little actual difference, as those defences had already proven to be no match for the Israelis in Syria and during previous raids inside Iran. The big display of Israeli special forces’ skills and capabilities in neutralising Iran’s air defence batteries appears in fact more a piece of psychological warfare than a real military need. The Israeli special forces also played a key role in targeting the military elite of Iran. The rather decrepit Iranian air force was also largely wiped out — but again nobody expected it could put up any resistance against the Israelis in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, it is in targeting his stated main objective — the nuclear programme — that Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has fallen shortest. Given that the key enrichment facilities of Fordow are beyond the reach of Israeli weapons, this is not surprising. But it does beg the question of what Israel’s strategy really is. Although Israel claims to have inflicted major damage on the strategic missile arsenal of Iran, the Iranians were nevertheless able on 14-15 June to launch several waves of long-range strikes against Israeli cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that Netanyahu bet that he could convince U.S. president Donald Trump to join the war after Iran — as expected — retaliated with strikes against Israel’s civilian population. If so, he might have miscalculated, as Trump rejected the invitation to join the operation. It has also gradually become known that Netanyahu hopes to eliminate the risk represented by Iran’s nuclear programme and nuclear capabilities by causing the Islamic Republic to collapse altogether. Netanyahu first hinted on 15 June that “regime change” was a possibility, and he has since repeated this multiple times. At this point, Netanyahu’s best chance at achieving victory involves creating conditions that lead to the ayatollahs being replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-iran-missed-the-june-13-attack&quot;&gt;Why Iran missed the June 13 attack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How vulnerable is the Iranian regime to Israeli efforts to bring it down? It is clear that the Islamic Republic had a very bad start to the campaign, with the Israelis succeeding in repeating the decapitation strategy that they inflicted on Hezbollah last year. This is remarkable and the effort of the Iranian government to make excuses, claiming that Trump misled them into thinking an Israeli strike would not happen while the talks were ongoing, does not really hold water. According to sources within the regime, the evening before the attack many Iranian officials were nervous due to the fact that a “friendly country” — likely Russia — had warned them of the imminent Israeli strike. It is possible that the Netanyahu government might have tipped the Russians off in order to safeguard its relations with Moscow. But then why didn’t the Iranians take precautions? Given previous Israeli strikes against Iran and Hezbollah, it defies belief that Tehran might have expected the strike to focus exclusively on nuclear infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be that the top leadership of the country, probably Supreme Leader Khamenei himself, might have decided to disregard that warning, but there were other signs of an incoming attack. These include the evacuation of U.S. embassies in the region, along with Trump’s own rhetoric. The IAEA’s statement on 11 June that Iran had refused the international watchdog access to the country’s nuclear sites and that Tehran was continuing to enrich uranium to 60% should also have advised caution to the Iranians. Instead, senior military leaders of Iran and some of its nuclear scientists were tracked and killed — some of them in their bedrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Khamenei might not have the pulse of the situation is not surprising. Alone at the top of the regime for 36 years, he has effectively been living in a bunker since 28 September 2024. He has mostly been relying on his advisers for information — including about the state of the armed forces, and the majority of his most trusted advisers are officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). These are unlikely to have frankly acknowledged to the Supreme Leader that their air defence was not up to scratch and highly likely to have portrayed Iran’s readiness in optimistic terms. After all, had they provided a more realistic assessment, the ever-increasing commitment of resources to the IRGC would perhaps have been questioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;irans-weak-spots&quot;&gt;Iran’s weak spots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Israelis have clearly been astonishingly successful at infiltrating Iran with their special forces, despite the Iranians knowing that the Israelis were present on Iran’s territory since at least 2007. Such Israeli infiltration operations have been intensifying in 2024, most notably with the killing of Hamas figure Ismail Haniyeh. It is obvious that the Israelis have considerable human intelligence resources in Iran and very likely also enjoy significant cooperation from elements of the Iranian armed forces. After the previous strikes on Iranian territory, waves of arrests of alleged Israeli spies and collaborators took place, mainly targeting the Iranian army. The army (artesh) competes with the IRGC for resources and has suffered in recent years from a re-allocation that has favoured the IRGC. The army’s political loyalty is also in question: during the wave of anti-regime demonstrations of 2022-2023, many desertions took place within its ranks, and according to sources within the army itself, recruitment has collapsed. The status of the army has been weakened and it now plays second fiddle to the IRGC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Israelis, on the other hand, were emboldened by their successful strikes against Hezbollah last year, and also by their feeling that the Iranian regime was in a state of decay — as highlighted by their growing success at infiltrating it. And there was indeed a sense of disillusionment inside the regime that affected even the IRGC. It should be assumed that the Israelis also sought contact with Iranian opposition groups, probably initially to recruit informers. If indeed Netanyahu has the collapse of the Islamic Republic in mind, trying to mobilise the internal opposition would be a necessary component of any such plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The non-violent opposition is not really organised nationally, it is fragmented into many small groups, and it completely lacks a leadership, making mobilising it quite hard. Sources within the regime report that monarchist elements have become active, trying to organise demonstrations, but with little success. The internal security apparatus of the regime is still fully functional for now, but one should not discount the strength of Iranian nationalism, nor the size of whatever remains of the social base of the regime. Eyewitnesses reported attempts by opponents of the regime to call for demonstrations from the windows of their houses, only to be rebutted and reported to the police by pro-regime neighbours. Along Iran’s borders there are also armed opposition groups, chief among them Kurds in the west and Baluchis in the east. Indeed, from Iran’s eastern border, sources within the main Baluchi opposition group, Jaysh ul Adl, have been reporting for months that Israeli funds are flowing towards their organisation and that they are being told to get ready for a big offensive in the wake of an Israeli/American attack on the regime. Black market arms dealers in Pakistan confirm that purchases by Jaysh ul Adl increased dramatically earlier this year. Among the Baluchi minority as a whole the reactions have been more mixed, with leading religious figure Mawlavi Abdul Hamid, known for his criticism of the regime, coming out in public in support of the Islamic Republic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Targeted Israeli military action could increase the relative strength of groups seeking to opposed the Iranian regime on the ground. After Iran launched ballistic missiles against Israel, Israeli counter-retaliation strikes have hit economic targets, in particular the oil industry. If the Israelis could inflict extensive damage on the economic and transport infrastructure, they could conceivably hope to undermine the regime’s ability to respond effectively to insurgents’ offensives and any outbreaks of mass protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Islamic Republic nonetheless appears to be on somewhat stronger ground after it was able to hit Israeli territory. It is not clear what Iran’s reserves of ballistic missiles are (it claims to have 2,000 of them). After the initial massive waves of retaliation, the Iranians reduced the numbers fired, but this could just be meant to ensure they have means of retaliation lasting for the coming several weeks. It is also not clear for how long Israel can keep striking Iran at such a pace. With the initial surprise gone, targeting the Iranian armed forces is not going to be as easy as it was at the start of the campaign, and presumably the Iranians have made contingency plans for dealing with an extensive air campaign against them. It will take a very extensive campaign to cripple the ability of the armed forces to contain any form of active opposition, and it is not clear whether Israel can sustain the necessary pressure alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;threats-to-israel&quot;&gt;Threats to Israel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There remains the possibility of the Iranians developing a nuclear weapon, which Netanyahu alleges they were doing anyway — and that they were two months away from completion at the start of his attack. While a long air campaign against Iran would in all likelihood see Israel outrun Iran’s reserve of ballistic missiles, it should also see the Iranians enrich enough uranium for a few atomic bombs (provided that Netanyahu is right).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other risk for Israel is that its decapitation strategy and the devastating air campaign might prompt the leadership of the Islamic Republic to mobilize popular support using a set of new policies, relying on Iranian nationalism for regaining legitimacy. The IRGC — the main supporter of the regime’s militarist approach — was clearly weakened and discredited by the first few days of the Israeli attack. Their reputation was already in question after the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, and their idea that the best form of deterrence for Iran involved supporting the Axis of Resistance has visibly failed. The IRGC is also seen as being the main beneficiary of the regime’s proactive power projection policy as well as of the sanctions regime that was implemented at least in part as a response to Tehran’s aggressive IRGC-driven foreign policy. Meanwhile, the rest of the country suffers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRGC specialises in sanctions busting and smuggling, activities that allegedly have allowed them to accumulate considerable wealth. Supreme Leader Khamenei might appear unlikely to go against the IRGC, and he may even take such a bold move as advocating for a return to the roots of the revolution. However, Khamenei already tested such a path in 2024, when he encouraged reformist Massud Pezeshkian to run for president — and even let him win — after having for years done his best to marginalise and undermine reformist politicians. Sources within the regime suggested at that time that Khamenei was aware of the leadership’s growing isolation from Iranian society. This suggests that such bold options are not to be ruled entirely out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RUSI’s Maritime Sanctions Taskforce convened again in May 2025 to examine the evolving threat posed by Russia’s shadow fleet and identify policy initiatives to counter its oil-exporting operations aimed at funding Russia’s military–industrial complex. The Taskforce brings together 60 representatives from government and industry, including major insurers, banks, law firms and maritime data providers. In the latest meeting, the Taskforce addressed three interrelated themes that form the structure of this report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding the role of the insurance sector in maritime sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identifying strategies for enhancing flag state accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhancing the targeting of the network of enablers supporting maritime sanctions evasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report concludes with policy recommendations identified by the Taskforce intended to enhance the implementation and enforcement of maritime sanctions, as well as to improve compliance with international maritime standards. Contributions from Taskforce members are made on an unattributable basis and this report does not necessarily represent the views of all Taskforce members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-role-of-the-insurance-sector-in-maritime-sanctions&quot;&gt;The Role of the Insurance Sector in Maritime Sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce began by examining how insurance – particularly protection and indemnity (P&amp;amp;I), cargo, and hull coverage – interacts with sanctions compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While P&amp;amp;I insurers have received most regulatory attention, participants stressed the need to consider how all categories of insurance relate to shadow fleet activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P&amp;amp;I insurance is especially visible in relation to sanctions compliance due to its role in liability coverage and its requirement for vessels to obtain entry into ports. All P&amp;amp;I clubs that are members of the International Group (IG) publicise the vessels they insure, making the clubs identifiable when potential breaches occur. Hull and cargo insurers carry the same sanctions compliance obligations but do not publicise the names of their assureds. Similarly, non-IG P&amp;amp;I insurers do not routinely publish lists of vessels insured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some hull and machinery and cargo insurers may monitor bills of lading and track vessel activities, but others may have less granular insight into shipping behaviour. Cargo insurance was flagged by participants as particularly opaque, and the “open cover” policies offered by many cargo insurers were discussed. These policies provide coverage across multiple shipments during the policy period and often do not allow for systematic disclosure of shipment-specific risk, especially when certain goods are prohibited in some destinations but not in others. Brokers and insurers are often unable to detect whether sanctioned goods – often subject to misrepresentation – are being traded unless counterparties voluntarily disclose such information or regulators provide specific warnings. Insurers may seek representations from clients but often lack the tools to enforce sanctions compliance at the cargo level. Some Taskforce members argued that mandatory voyage-by-voyage reporting mechanisms could improve compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hull insurance, though less prominent, becomes critical when the vessel itself is sanctioned, according to industry representatives at the Taskforce. A sanctioned ship without hull coverage represents a significant risk to cargo owners and financial institutions involved in the trade. Yet hull coverage is often overlooked in enforcement discussions, despite playing an important role when sanctioned vessels are transferred, damaged, or abandoned and left adrift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants highlighted the limited ability of insurers to verify downstream actors in complex transactions. Direct insurers typically contract with the commodity trader or shipowner, but they cannot easily identify or verify charterers, ship managers or port agents involved in the insured voyage. Many Taskforce members agreed that Know Your Customer’s Customer (KYCC) expectations are unrealistic unless insurers receive legal support and intelligence-sharing from authorities. But without access to data from customs, financial intelligence units or vessel inspection reports, insurers cannot effectively flag high-risk activity. Even when asked to avoid sanctionable transactions, brokers and carriers often rely on client declarations and lack the ability to conduct independent verification. This points to the limits of voluntary attestation-based compliance in high-risk environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the challenge of accessing compliance documentation, particularly when new requirements such as the oil price cap (OPC) or restrictions on Russian diamonds are introduced mid-contract, the Lloyd’s Market Association (LMA) has issued a clause welcomed by many Taskforce members that imposes two key obligations on the (re)insured: to maintain records demonstrating compliance with relevant laws and regulations regarding the insured subject matter; and to provide, upon reasonable request, evidence needed by the (re)insurer or broker to satisfy themselves or any regulator of such compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns also arose regarding unintended consequences. Overregulation might encourage insurers to withdraw from high-risk sectors entirely, creating a vacuum filled by less reputable insurers. Some Taskforce members noted that advisory notices issued by governments are useful documents but frequently extend beyond the scope of formal legal measures, creating uncertainty. Insurers often act with caution, denying coverage to avoid regulatory exposure even in the absence of a formal prohibition. This decreases transparency and increases the likelihood that shadow fleet operations will continue undetected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce advised regulators to engage more consistently with marine insurance associations to develop workable compliance expectations. Insurers requested that expectations around risk screening and reporting should reflect commercial realities, as pushing for perfect compliance may result in market exits and rising dependence on insurers without adequate governance. This will lead to further growing gaps in global coverage and make room for poorly regulated alternative operators to gain ground, allowing the shadow fleet’s parallel operating infrastructure to expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion also highlighted the emergence of non-IG P&amp;amp;I insurers operating outside traditional jurisdictions. The growth of Russian and regionally based insurance backed by the Russian Central Bank enables sanctioned vessels to demonstrate insurance coverage despite failing to meet international transparency and solvency standards. Even where such coverage is adequately capitalised, it may be unable to function properly because of the impact of Western sanctions. Although flag states are responsible for verifying the validity of liability insurance under International Maritime Organization (IMO) guidelines, many registries lack the technical capacity or willingness to evaluate the adequacy of insurance providers. The result is a gap in oversight whereby sanctioned vessels obtain questionable coverage and continue operations. Participants also noted a growing number of insurers based in Asia and the Middle East, specifically China and the UAE, entering the market with minimal transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce also discussed the introduction by the Nordic-Baltic 8++ countries of the voluntary insurance reporting mechanism (VIRM), which requests vessels transiting their territorial waters to disclose their insurance details. Governments use this system to collect data on insurance coverage, verify compliance and request additional information where red flags appear. Representatives from the UK government at the meeting stated that the VIRM has prompted high levels of voluntary cooperation and has helped identify over 270 individual vessels of concern. While the reporting mechanism is voluntary, a lack of response from vessels might increase scrutiny and can prompt further investigations. Taskforce members welcomed the VIRM’s deterrence effect and recognised the value of sharing this approach with European partners. The Taskforce highlighted the significant step taken by the EU with the amendment to the Vessel Monitoring Directive, which requires all vessels, including those merely passing through EU waters without entering an EU port, to provide insurance information. However, questions persisted around the actions to be taken against vessels that decline to disclose their insurance under the EU’s mandatory regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enhancing-flag-state-accountability&quot;&gt;Enhancing Flag State Accountability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce turned next to the issue of flag state compliance with international maritime obligations, with a focus on how weak oversight and opaque registries have allowed the shadow fleet to operate unchecked. Flag states provide vessels with their legal nationality and are responsible for ensuring compliance with safety, environmental and insurance standards, under Article 94 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Thus, flag states must exercise jurisdiction and control over ships flying their flag, but the Taskforce stressed that these obligations remain largely unenforced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNCLOS contains no practical enforcement mechanism beyond interstate litigation, and there is no tribunal or international process for revoking the registry privileges of non-compliant states. As a result, countries that offer so-called “flags of convenience” face little consequence for failing to uphold international standards. Participants noted that flag registries often function with minimal state oversight – especially in countries that outsource their registry management to private operators – and that shadow fleet vessels can exploit these gaps by hopping rapidly through multiple flag registries. Participants identified countries such as Gambia, Honduras, Mongolia, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sierra Leone and Tanzania as jurisdictions where registries have become popular with the shadow fleet because they impose few entry requirements, lack rigorous inspection regimes and rarely scrutinise the insurance coverage or ownership structures of the vessels they flag. In one recent example raised by a participant, a vessel reflagged four times in a matter of weeks, passing through several of these permissive jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This frequent switching makes it difficult for flag states to maintain oversight and accountability. Participants observed that even when port state control authorities identify deficiencies during inspections, the corresponding flag state is rarely held to account. In many cases, such deficiencies only come to light after port authorities intervene. However, Taskforce members also observed that sustained diplomatic engagement can achieve results in countering illicit operations and raise the costs for shadow fleet operators. As explored in past Taskforce reports, countries like Panama and Liberia, which operate some of the world’s largest registries, have responded positively to UK and EU outreach. Persistent diplomatic efforts have led additional countries like Gabon and Barbados to deregister sanctioned vessels and take steps to distance themselves from shadow fleet activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While private companies may operate a registry, the Taskforce argued that the government of the country/flag state where the registry is located should retain ultimate responsibility and must be held accountable under international law. Registry activity reflects on the sovereign state, and failure to exercise proper control not only violates UNCLOS but also contributes to broader systemic risks. The Taskforce emphasised that countries must be mindful of how their national symbols are used. As one participant framed it, a country’s flag is not just a business tool; it is a signal of the country’s regulatory integrity and global reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce considered the role of the IMO in strengthening compliance. Under current IMO rules, flag states are responsible for verifying that insurers issuing Blue Cards meet adequate solvency and transparency standards. However, as explained above, this requirement is inconsistently applied. Some Taskforce members cited instances where flag state personnel lacked basic awareness of financial solvency indicators or how to evaluate insurance documents. Several flag registries were said to accept Blue Cards issued by insurers with no public records, no credit rating, no audited financials and no track record of claims payouts. These lapses illustrate a profound gap between legal obligations and actual regulatory practice. An example of these risks can be found in the case of the now sanctioned Norway-based insurer Ro Marine, which provided forged documentation to fraudulently insure dozens of shadow fleet vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, Taskforce participants recommended that IMO guidance be strengthened to require public disclosure of insurer information, including capital adequacy, credit ratings and financial audit data. While acknowledging that the IMO is not – and must not become – a sanctions enforcement body, participants argued that enhancing insurance transparency aligns with the IMO’s mandate to protect the marine environment and improve safety standards. The information disclosure would help flag state and port state control authorities assess the legitimacy of insurance coverage, and would improve the transparency of vessels operating under flags that continue to facilitate shadow fleet activity under the guise of formal compliance. It would also reduce the risk of environmental damage caused by poorly insured vessels and enhance the ability of regulators to detect problematic registry practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce also explored the viability of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) including flag registry oversight in its mutual evaluation process. FATF already assesses the implementation of UN-related counter-proliferation financing (CPF) sanctions (primarily in relation to North Korea). Some Taskforce members argued that this framework should include the assessment of whether countries hosting flag registries are enabling sanctions evasion, including through deficient flag state oversight of vessel insurance and compliance standards. Despite FATF’s scope being limited to UN sanctions, raising flag state standards would impact all shadow fleets, not only North Korea’s. Evaluating flag state performance as part of a country’s broader financial integrity could elevate the issue politically and incentivise better registry governance. This would move accountability from the private operators of the registry to the government that authorises and benefits from its operations. A FATF finding of deficiency could be labelled as a technical compliance failure and potentially lead to greylisting, which would increase international scrutiny and trigger reputational and economic consequences for the country concerned. As one Taskforce member put it, “if a country wants the economic benefits of hosting a major registry, it must also accept the regulatory responsibilities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognising that enhancing the roles of the IMO and FATF might take time, the Taskforce recommended in the meantime that a list of high-risk flag registries based on internationally recognised criteria be developed to help regulators and industry identify problematic jurisdictions. This list could draw from existing frameworks such as the “white-grey-black” lists of the Paris and Tokyo Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and the International Chamber of Shipping’s Shipping Industry Flag State Performance Table, which evaluates flags based on specific criteria such as port state control inspection records, average age of the fleet, and ratification of international conventions. While some participants questioned the practicality of “naming and shaming” registries, others argued that such a list would help guide industry risk assessments and encourage registries to improve performance. One participant noted that the UK and most EU member states, as members of the Paris MoU, already participate in the creation of such lists to prioritise port state control actions, and should consider incorporating similar metrics to produce a list of all high-risk flag registries. The EU and UK also maintain FATF-based lists of anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism high-risk countries, and that approach could serve as a model for developing a maritime equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-risk flags could be subjected to increased inspections, detentions or even port entry restrictions. Some Taskforce members recommended compiling and maintaining a high-risk registry list based on port state control records, FATF assessments and insurance validation failures. Such a list could guide due diligence for insurers, financiers and port authorities, increasing the operational burden on shadow fleet vessels and making registries more cautious in accepting questionable applicants. A shared understanding among international governments and industry would have a significant impact in raising standards globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a ship is removed from a registry that seeks to raise its standards, it will probably seek to continue its operations under a different, more permissive flag. Taskforce members recommended that enforcement authorities should therefore extend flag state outreach to develop deeper coordination between flag states and enforcement agencies to track vessels across registry changes and share information in real time. One participant suggested the creation of an international flag state information-sharing mechanism, similar to the Registry Information Sharing Compact (RISC) but expanded to more jurisdictions – though others noted the legal and institutional barriers to implementing such a mechanism. Several Taskforce members also advocated for harsher measures to target the enabling infrastructures that allow shadow fleet vessels to operate globally. This is further explored in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;addressing-maritime-sanctions-evasion-networks&quot;&gt;Addressing Maritime Sanctions Evasion Networks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce then focused on the ecosystem of actors, tactics and structural enablers that allow the shadow fleet to continue operating despite increasing enforcement pressure. Taskforce members highlighted that sanctions evasion in the maritime domain does not occur in isolation. Instead, it relies on a broad infrastructure of third-party service providers – including brokers, shipowners, vessel management companies and financial intermediaries – which knowingly or negligently enables continued trade with sanctioned entities. Participants highlighted the central role of certain London-based ship brokers in assembling clusters of vessels to supply to the shadow fleet, by structuring opaque ownership arrangements, matching buyers and sellers, and identifying permissive registries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce members noted that the sale of tankers often involves a standard practice whereby sellers request a declaration from buyers confirming that the vessel will not be used in violation of the OPC or to trade with sanctioned jurisdictions. However, these declarations are largely performative. A recent case highlighted by Taskforce members involved the UK’s decision to sanction British ship finance veteran John Ormerod for facilitating the supply of 25 second-hand tankers into Russia’s shadow fleet. The case illustrates how experienced actors in the shipping and finance sectors have supported sanctions evasion through structuring complex ownership arrangements and networks of offshore companies. Despite the scale and sophistication of the operation, intermediaries and brokers involved in similar deals have largely avoided enforcement action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several participants questioned why intermediaries involved in high-value tanker transactions with clear links to sanctioned entities had not faced any enforcement action, and they considered this gap in the sanctions strategy a priority. In the case of Ormerod, the seller was sanctioned, but the broker and the financier involved in structuring the transaction were not. The absence of consequences risks creating incentives for intermediaries to ignore red flags and facilitate ongoing violations of sanctions measures. This undermines the deterrent effect of sanctions and allows enablers to adapt quickly to designation actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce also addressed the role of non-aligned jurisdictions and their permissive ports and logistics hubs in enabling shadow fleet operations. Ports and refineries in China and India continue to accept Russian crude carried by designated or high-risk vessels, often without any apparent concern for the origin of the cargo or the insurance status of the ship. Participants noted that while some jurisdictions, such as India, have started to reject high-risk vessels out of a desire to remain integrated in global markets, others have emerged as safe havens for shadow fleet operations. Taskforce members highlighted that bunkering services, crew changes and maintenance are frequently provided in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, allowing the fleet to maintain operational continuity. These jurisdictions are also used to store oil offshore or conduct ship-to-ship transfers in remote anchorages, evading G7 regulatory oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One member described Malaysia as “the epicentre of lawlessness”, with dozens of shadow fleet tankers regularly engaging in ship-to-ship transfers and manipulating their automatic identification systems. Taskforce members warned that these practices risked catastrophic maritime incidents and urged states to apply existing maritime safety conventions more rigorously, especially in high-risk zones, as a means of curbing the operational viability of the shadow fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce members thus stressed the need for a policy shift that mirrors the recent US actions against Iran, where the entire supply chain, including refineries, ports, shipping agents and other stakeholders in third countries, has been designated to increase pressure on the broader network. The US uses secondary sanctions aggressively, heightening the risks for third parties to engage with designated entities. Vessels involved in Iranian trade, for example, are therefore often treated as untouchable under US sanctions. The Taskforce acknowledged that UK and EU sanctions lack the secondary reach of US measures and are primarily limited to direct jurisdictional reach, offering less deterrence. Without the ability to impose sanctions on third-country entities, the UK and EU have limited options for curbing this activity. Several members argued that the UK and EU must adopt similar approaches to the US if they are to have an impact on not only the vessels but also the surrounding infrastructure that sustains them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taskforce-recommendations&quot;&gt;Taskforce Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce concluded that while diplomatic engagement and reputational pressure have yielded some success, systemic reform remains difficult. UNCLOS lacks the enforcement tools to compel compliance, and many flag states have little incentive to tighten their oversight over the insurance coverage of the vessels under their registration. An effective response must include revising IMO guidelines, incorporating registry oversight into FATF evaluations, deepening diplomatic engagement and coordinating with the insurance community. Only by aligning these levers can regulators close the governance loopholes that allow the shadow fleet to continue operating under the cover of legal registration. The Taskforce reiterated that strengthening flag state accountability is essential not only to enforcing maritime sanctions but also to preserving the integrity of the international maritime system. Yet the Taskforce also acknowledged that securing revisions to IMO guidelines or the FATF standards is unlikely in the near term, necessitating the development of a high-risk list that can be used to “name and shame” those registries that fail to meet international standards and act as a warning mechanism for private sector actors conducting due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce also reaffirmed that disrupting sanctions evasion requires attention to not only the vessels but also the full network of actors that sustain them. Brokers, registries, ports and refineries all play critical roles in enabling illicit maritime activity. Regulatory strategies must therefore target these enablers collectively, rather than focusing on vessels in isolation. Strengthening enforcement against enablers and increasing international pressure on jurisdictions hosting them will be essential to reduce the economic viability of shadow fleet operations and restore the effectiveness of global sanctions frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve these policy goals, the following recommendations emerged from the Taskforce discussion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhance public sector cooperation with the insurance industry&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Governments and regulators should enhance their collaboration with the insurance industry through structured information-sharing mechanisms. The complexity of the insurance sector demands greater understanding by the public sector, and regulatory expectations should be fine-tuned to the capabilities of industry. The insurance sector is a key player in compliance with maritime sanctions and a valuable source of information. Public–private collaboration should be deepened to leverage industry expertise and access to operational intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scale up the VIRM&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The VIRM should be scaled up into a reliable dataset on vessel insurance and ownership, with non-compliance triggering heightened scrutiny. The UK should explore making it mandatory in line with the EU’s recent amendment to the Vessel Monitoring Directive. Additionally, an action plan should be developed in case of non-compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strengthen the IMO guidelines on insurance disclosures&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The IMO should revise its guidelines to enhance the public disclosures of insurer solvency data, credit ratings and audited financial statements, and improve compliance by flag states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include flag registries in FATF evaluations&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The key role played by flag registries in achieving compliance with CPF standards should lead FATF to ensure that its mutual evaluation procedure includes an assessment of their effective oversight. FATF has proved to be an effective body in raising transparency and government performance globally, and could help ensure the enforcement of flag state obligations to observe CPF standards, which would hinder the operations of all shadow fleets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop a public list of high-risk flag registries&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This list should guide insurer, shipper and financier risk assessments and deter engagement with systematically non-compliant jurisdictions. This initiative could be built on tools like the Paris and Tokyo MoUs and the International Chamber of Shipping’s Shipping Industry Flag State Performance Table.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build a cross-jurisdictional flag registry coordination mechanism&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The UK and G7+ should support efforts to develop an intergovernmental platform to track deregistered vessels and prevent their rapid reflagging in permissive states. RISC should serve as an inspirational model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designate the entire sanctions evasion supply chain&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Enforcement agencies should target brokers, escrow agents, financiers and intermediaries, as well as ports, port authorities and refineries, which knowingly support and contribute to shadow fleet operations. The EU and UK should enhance their designations of third-country entities in order to reduce the effectiveness gap between their sanctions and those of the US.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there has been heightened activity on maritime sanctions in the UK and EU in recent weeks, significant gaps persist in the ability of G7 allies to disrupt Russia’s funding from the sale of oil. As the Taskforce discussion highlighted, scrutiny of the infrastructure that supports Russia’s shadow fleet must be heightened in order to close loopholes and vulnerabilities that the Kremlin continues to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

If the UK wants to use and protect truly sovereign capabilities it will need sustained and probably increased investment to succeed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence in the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) of a section on space alongside the land, sea, maritime, and cyber &amp;amp; electromagnetic domains represents the latest step of a journey kicked off by the Integrated Review of 2021 to make space a fully-fledged “operational domain”. It was the Integrated Review that committed the funds for the creation of a UK Space Command, endorsed by the subsequent Defence Command Paper with a plan to establish a National Space Operations Centre, and to improve both the UK’s understanding of space as an environment and its access to and use of space-based capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The refresh of the Integrated Review and Command Paper in 2023, following the publication of a National Space Strategy and the Space Defence Strategy, all reaffirmed the significance of space and the direction of travel. But what the new SDR demands in terms of the transformation of the Armed Forces may require additional prioritisation of resources allocated to space if it is to succeed in its aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-is-critical-to-the-sdrs-approach&quot;&gt;Space is Critical to the SDR’s Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because the UK is still developing as a space power in its own right, but the SDR sets out an approach that will depend heavily on space-based capabilities as well as asking Defence to do more to protect the UK’s space interests. While the SDR is not purely about technology, at the heart of the technology component is better use of a greater volume of information, backed up by faster processing and decision-making, allied to improved weapons. The ability to act more rapidly and concentrate force is intended to improve the combat power of the Armed Forces, and the best example of this is in the new “Digital Targeting Web” allocated £1 billion to bring it into service in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a network can only succeed if supported with space-based capabilities. First, it will require a variety of overhead collection capabilities, able to gather information under all weather conditions, and thus involving a range of electro-optical, passive infra-red, signals interception and synthetic aperture radar sensors. These capabilities can all be provided by terrestrial sensors, but none with the kind of global coverage or time over the target that space-based sensors can provide given their varying altitudes and orbits, which also protect them from direct attack by most conventional weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, moving this data around will require links that are difficult to intercept and can provide connections well beyond line of sight, to any point of the globe at a moment’s notice. Access to internet-based communications is the most straightforward way of achieving this, but for obvious reasons of connectivity and security, militaries generally desire their own assured communications satellites, even though much can be done over commercial providers like Starlink, which has been popular in the Russo-Ukrainian War for command and control. The UK’s satellite communication system is the unfortunately-named SKYNET, but the SDR seems to have concerns over the resilience of the network and its forthcoming upgrades and recommends it is periodically reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the SDR recommends more UK effort on Integrated Air and Missile Defence (IAMD) both in support of NATO more broadly and in direct defence of the UK. As the SDR specifically identifies, this will require investment in space-based capabilities in the form of a “next-generation, overhead, persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capability”, particularly if the threat is from ballistic missiles which require early identification before or when they are launched. Terrestrial, but space-related capabilities, such as the early-warning radar at RAF Fylingdales would also be important to such a system, as well as meeting the ambition to improve the UK’s understanding of what is happening in space (Space Domain Awareness).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in a section that has been little-commented on, the SDR suggests the UK should prioritise investment in counter-space systems, given the need for greater freedom of action in space (Space Control) and to understand adversary capabilities better. This reflects a recognition that the threats to space-based capabilities have been growing, as seen in the Russian anti-satellite test of 2021 (which generated a significant volume of space debris), and the Russian disruption of satellite services, which started early on in its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 but has continued since. There is further recent reporting on the suspicion that Russia has placed a nuclear-based anti-satellite weapon in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither has China been idle since its anti-satellite test in 2007, and the latest US Annual Threat Assessment judged that China has now surpassed Russia as a space leader, fielding a range of ground-based counter-space capabilities and conducting on-orbit inspections of other satellites. Not only does the MOD need to protect its own systems, but the SDR highlights the centrality of space to the UK more broadly with nearly 20% of national GDP reliant on satellite services. It estimates disruption to the Global Positioning System would cost the UK economy an estimated £1bn a day (and given these are figures from nearly seven years ago, more recent ones from 2022 and 2023 suggest both numbers will be at least as big now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uks-space-capabilities-lift-off-or-still-on-the-launchpad&quot;&gt;The UK’s Space Capabilities: Lift-Off or Still on the Launchpad?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is no small set of demands. And although the establishment of UK Space Command and the publication of the UK Space Strategy set the UK on a positive trajectory, it is still early in its journey both in terms of capability and the understanding of space. It is often under-appreciated how limited the UK’s sovereign space capabilities have been, while the importance of space has grown. Critically, the UK has benefitted enormously from access to largely US systems, saving itself the enormous expense of developing, launching and maintaining its own satellites, but at the cost of having little of its own beyond the SKYNET communications system already mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the UK military had no space-based surveillance of any kind, and its foray in the 1980s into space-based signals intelligence ended in the cancellation of the disastrous Zircon project. What it has managed to do is gain access through the Five Eyes global intelligence partnership to largely US-derived imagery and intelligence. By providing processing and analytical capability, mostly through the National Centre for Geospatial Intelligence (NCGI) and its predecessor organisations, the UK has been able to “buy-in” to a vast geospatial intelligence network – where even just purchasing the imagery over a year would cost several billion pounds, possibly as much as the entirety of the UK’s intelligence budget on its own. Similarly, Fylingdales links the UK into a much broader early-warning network, including both ground-based systems and the Space-Based Infra-Red System (SBIRS) to detect missile launches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-grey-to-white-the-development-of-istari&quot;&gt;From Grey to White: The Development of ISTARI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK programme to address the UK’s space shortfalls is ISTARI, a £968 billion programme intended to produce an sovereign operational UK surveillance constellation by 2031 (and, probably not coincidentally, sharing its name with the order of wizards from The Lord of the Rings). The demonstration phase of this, launching test satellites, has already started, and gives the UK its first sovereign space surveillance capability since the technology demonstrator Carbonite-2, launched in 2018 (and of which little has been seen since). It involves launching the first UK military-owned surveillance satellite, as well as building and developing the ground-based control and communications systems to operate a constellation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it gives us indications how far the UK has to go. The initial batch of satellites, as demonstrators, are more limited in their capabilities than the eventual operational constellation: the first imagery satellite, Tyche, was launched in 2024 but is only likely to have a lifespan of around 5 years and captures imagery at a resolution similar to medium-quality commercial satellites and far short of the alleged capabilities of high-end military satellites. The next pair, under the Oberon system, will be more advanced but are not due to be launched until 2027, and the same is true for Juno, the next electro-optical satellite to be launched. The UK therefore has an existing plan and funding to develop its sovereign space capabilities, but at a pace and level of resources matched to a global context several years out of date. The increased demand on space capabilities we can infer from the SDR’s enthusiasm for the “targeting web” and drastically-improved UK communications and data-sharing are unlikely to be met from UK sovereign capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;breaking-free-of-the-uss-gravitational-pull&quot;&gt;Breaking Free of the US’s Gravitational Pull?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This matters because as described above the UK has until now had the security of being able to access US data and capabilities. Yet US reliability is now more doubtful, even if a complete rupture in relations (damaging to both) has been avoided. It is not hard to imagine that US prioritisation of collection (not a new challenge) would become more problematic if political priorities with the UK diverged. And it isn’t just imagery where the UK has a close relationship with the US and benefits from US space. The signal from the US Global Positioning System (GPS) is used for position, navigation and timing (vital for accurate targeting): geospatial information provided by the US underpins UK targeting and mapping systems, not least because that derived from GPS for the military is more precise than the civilian equivalent. When the UK was in discussion with Ukraine in 2024 over the use of UK-provided Storm Shadow cruise missiles against targets in Russia, it had to seek US “approval”, even though the weapons were UK-French and not subject to US export controls. This was almost certainly because precise mission planning and targeting required US-originated geospatial and imagery information. In other words, in terms of space, what was until now an efficiency in the UK system is now obviously a dependence, verging on a vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-infinity-and-beyond--or-at-least-low-earth-orbit&quot;&gt;To Infinity and Beyond – Or at Least Low Earth Orbit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale and scope of US space capabilities means that it is impossible for the UK to try and duplicate them over the next few years, and probably unrealistic even over the medium term. But if the UK wishes to be a sovereign space power and insulate itself from friction in the US relationship, additional investment over and above that which is planned will be desirable. It currently does not have access to many European programmes, such as the Galileo global-positioning system, as a consequence of Brexit, though it is still a member of the European Space Agency. Many European countries have drawn similar conclusions to the UK about the importance of sovereign capabilities, and have begun expanding their space programmes but full sharing of information is not straightforward. Another option is the Aquila constellation being developed as a NATO capability, as well as an EU PESCO initiative if the UK participated; none are sovereign options though and create other dependencies. The development of sovereign and ideally military-owned or operated systems is also required as insulation against wider commercial or political headwinds. While Starlink has, as mentioned, found popularity, it is still a commercial endeavour and does not provide an assured service even while it bests other commercial options. Similarly, commercial imagery can be subject to both commercial and political pressure, as recently seen in the case of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDR makes clear the significance of space to the future security of the UK, and the recommendations it includes carry with them an increased demand for capabilities, as well as the ability to protect those capabilities and space’s support to the UK economy and society. But beyond the process and structural recommendations on working with NATO Allies, being a priority portfolio for the new National Armaments Director, and linking military space into a reinvigorated national approach, the SDR is vague on extra resources, and the last Budget did not provide anything new. Major space-based capabilities beyond small demonstrators can still take years to develop, and so if any additional capabilities will be required as part of making the UK “ready for war” there is a time imperative to make those decisions soon to be in place by the early 2030s. The same is true to start making strides in counter-space capabilities, and in protecting the UK network, given the head start adversaries have. Making a success of the SDR will require at the very least sustained investment in the current military space programme and continued reliance on partners, if not additional investment and the acceleration of the ISTARI programme. The alternative is a UK space programme stuck looking up to the stars in envy as others surpass it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria faces numerous security threats: from high rates of violent crime and enduring kidnap-for-ransom issues to long-running insurgencies in the northeast and a metastasising banditry problem in the northwest. Local assessments of these dynamics are often contested across demography and geography, at times feeding on a mix of context-specific tensions and historical inequalities. Given the influence such perspectives can have on the success and efficacy of interventions, it is essential to better understand grassroots experiences of insecurity and their associated pathways of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on fieldwork conducted across Borno, Yobe and Kaduna, this report takes bottom-up perceptions of violence as a starting point for analysing northern Nigeria’s threat landscape, exploring how organised crime, terrorism and other forms of insecurity are perceived at the subnational and local level. Much of the analysis is based on interview and focus group data, incorporating existing literature to caveat and contextualise respondent contributions (where possible) within a wider body of evidence. Such insights offer valuable entry points for interrogating the mechanisms that feed into and facilitate violence, and for identifying the implications they raise for domestic stakeholders and foreign donors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants broadly identified four categories of violence – terrorism, banditry, petty crime and gangsterism, and corruption and extra-legal abuses – although the exact scope, mechanics and impact varied. Many highlighted how the fragmentation of violent extremism (VE) in the northeast has led to divergent forms of behaviour, with some groups seen as predatory and indiscriminate while others appeared more predictable and rational, despite the widespread conflation of terrorist activity under the generic label of “Boko Haram”. While VE was considered an increasingly ruralised problem due to the securitisation of urban spaces in the northeast, banditry seems ever-more pervasive, impacting remote villages, towns and cities, and diffusing from the northwest to other regions. The emergence of jihadist symbols and tactics – including mass kidnappings and complex attacks on military targets – has led to considerable international discussion over a prospective “crime–terror nexus”, notions of which were reflected in a small proportion of the interview data. However, respondents also highlighted the chaotic and opportunistic nature of conflict across the north and the insufficiency of existing national-legal categorisations for violence, which is often context-specific and highly localised (despite operational similarities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the scale of VE and banditry means they tend to become the focus of national and international interventions, participants acknowledged the additional impact of petty crime and gangsterism on regional communities. These were identified as both a cause and a consequence of insecurity and were linked by interviewees to long-term structural issues of unemployment and undereducation, as well as to trauma, displacement and disruption caused by ongoing conflict. Similarly, local fieldwork referenced the propensities of government actors to generate insecurity – from extra-legal violence to endemic corruption – leading to chronic levels of distrust and a perception that political and economic elites benefit from continued instability. While state authorities and portions of the wider public have empowered so-called “vigilante” groups – given their apparent role as an effective security provider – several participants expressed concern over their alleged involvement in criminal behaviour and the risk of further upheaval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these discrete forms of insecurity have their own thematically and spatially defined drivers and dynamics, they coexist within a shared social ecology – a broader system conducive to violent mobilisation. In the case of northern Nigeria, the cumulative impact of colonial mismanagement and neo-patrimonial governance has arguably encouraged systemic corruption, impunity and the normalisation of coercion and criminality as tools of political competition. While the scope, intensity and resonance of these variables fluctuate over time, interviewee data implies they facilitate different modes of violence at a subnational level, as do the social responses to associated gaps in state reach, capacity and legitimacy. These problems can incentivise various experiments in local self-help, encouraging the emergence of alternative authority structures (whether bandit, criminal, extremist or vigilante), which are themselves liable to become vectors of instability. Bottom-up survival strategies and coping-mechanisms have, for instance, blurred the boundaries between licit and illicit behaviour, with communities reshaping social and economic norms in recognition of the constraints afflicting everyday life under the shadow of armed groups. In doing so, they have inadvertently shifted local perceptions and parameters of legitimate and illegitimate action further away from the national-legal definitions on which donors usually rely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these findings, the authors have identified a range of policy recommendations for the donor community to consider. The first two were drawn from suggestions put forward by interviewees themselves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spaces for dialogue and collaboration between civilians, state actors and security personnel may help to improve local confidence,&lt;/strong&gt; reduce tensions, rebuild trust, increase transparency and help to instil a sense of ownership and responsibility among local people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community members should be engaged in anti-corruption efforts,&lt;/strong&gt; with bottom-up education and sensitisation campaigns accompanying top-down reforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors also flag a series of wider implications and prescriptions to inform donor approaches in the future, while acknowledging the complex and challenging reality of navigating both local and national scepticism of external interventions and barriers to programming in certain no-go policy areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Porous boundaries between licit and illicit economies complicate programming.&lt;/strong&gt; Donors may find that focusing on behaviours rather than national-legal definitions of crime and terrorism is more sensitive (and relevant) to local understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust deficits must be overcome to facilitate meaningful community engagement with, and ownership of, donor programming.&lt;/strong&gt; Distrust and social fragmentation may limit the efficacy of external interventions, highlighting the need for donors to address this trust deficit through consistent engagement to better mobilise community buy-in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The disconnect between local and national/international understandings of insecurity in northern Nigeria needs to be addressed.&lt;/strong&gt; Poorly informed responses risk neglecting local realities, discounting community perspectives and overlooking informal structures of governance and legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interventions should be integrated and cross-cutting,&lt;/strong&gt; ensuring that different lines of effort are mutually reinforcing and commensurate with the system-level problems they are tackling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress is hampered by minimal political appetite for reform, which can limit donor agency to enact change.&lt;/strong&gt; Incremental reform along with support for political, institutional and civic islands of integrity may yield more success than the exogenous imposition of anti-corruption initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria faces several “security conundrums”, from petty graft and organised crime to recurrent resource competition, separatism, sectarianism and extremism. Although the full scope of local violence is often difficult to quantify, at least 350,000 deaths have stemmed from successive insurgencies across the north since 2009, while hostilities between herders and sedentary farmers have displaced over 300,000 people along the country’s “Middle Belt”. Amid “scorched earth” tactics, vigilante violence and the profusion of ethnic militias, studies suggest inter-communal tensions accounted for six times the number of civilians killed by the Islamist outfit Jama’tu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati wal-Jihad (JAS, popularly known as “Boko Haram”) and its various offshoots in 2017. In the northwest, banditry has reportedly surged by 731%, surpassing the fatality rates of more “conventional” conflicts afflicting the northeast between 2018 and 2023. Over the past year, escalating insecurity – including abductions and extra-judicial killings – shut down three local government areas (LGAs) in Zamfara alone, with 700,000 residents fleeing their homes. Against this backdrop, 33 million Nigerians (roughly 15% of the population) now face food shortages, while the army is having to assume a “policing” role across all 36 federal states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the scale and urgency of this crisis, policy is not always seen as reflecting or directly addressing local realities, needs or concerns. While insecurity tends to affect those on the social and geographic fringes most acutely, their perceptions and experiences are rarely captured in empirical datasets, which can leave decision-makers overly reliant on elite assumptions. Drawing on fieldwork across multiple states, this report attempts to alleviate these gaps, examining bottom-up perspectives of Nigeria’s threat landscape – including organised crime and terrorism – to better inform national and international responses. This primarily involves unpacking sources of insecurity as determined by local stakeholders themselves, examining their mechanics, resonance and impact on host communities, and how, in some cases, they may be seen to diverge from state and national government priorities or from donor interests. Such insights offer valuable entry points for interrogating the broader mechanisms that feed into, and facilitate, violence. While discrete forms of insecurity have their own thematically and spatially defined drivers and dynamics, they coexist within a shared social ecology, a wider system conducive to violent mobilisation. Simply put, they are different symptoms of the same wicked problem, the scope and complexity of which needs to be acknowledged and factored into programme design and policy formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding how this environment diminishes trust in formal governance, diffuses and normalises violence, and propels social fragmentation is therefore essential for assessing local experiences of insecurity, identifying plausible pathways of change, and developing intervention strategies. Accordingly, this report examines the following research questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How are organised crime, terrorism and other forms of insecurity perceived and experienced at the local level in Nigeria?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the mechanisms conditioning local insecurity?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the implications for interventions by national stakeholders and foreign donors?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis primarily draws on participant insights, while integrating existing literature where possible, to caveat and contextualise claims and situate grassroots experiences within the wider evidence base. This is followed by recommendations for policymakers and practitioners focusing on how they can adapt their approaches to better address insecurity at the subnational level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report is part of a broader three-year project, “Organised Crime, Terror, and Insecurity in Africa” (OCTA), exploring local perceptions of these issues across several case study countries, including Nigeria and Mozambique. These states all face significant problems with organised crime, terrorism and related security concerns, share challenges in responding to such threats (for example, limited resources and corruption vulnerabilities), and have been large recipients of foreign assistance and advice. The project’s contribution is to complement conventional, top-down notions of insecurity – which generally privilege government and donor perspectives – with bottom-up efforts that harness local knowledge, provide a holistic appraisal of the security landscape and contribute to more effective interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-challenges-and-limitations&quot;&gt;Methodology, Challenges and Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report is based on research managed between February 2022 and January 2024, which included an in-depth review of open-source literature and country-based fieldwork to gauge different aspects of the security context in northern Nigeria. Three partner organisations – Conciliation Resources (CR), Hope Interactive and Unified Members for Women Advancement – conducted key informant interviews (see Table 1) from August to November 2023, gathering grassroots perceptions of insecurity across three states – Borno, Yobe and Kaduna – alongside supplementary input from stakeholders in Abuja. Although planned research in Zamfara was suspended due to safety concerns, the team was able to draw on existing analysis supplied by a local academic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees were selected using the partners’ existing networks and familiarity with the field sites, drawing from various communities based on their knowledge of local security issues. This included Nigerian civil society organisations (CSO) and NGO representatives, delegates from different social and youth groups, traditional and religious leaders, local officials, security personnel (including military and police), academics, journalists, businesspeople, vendors, union workers, and other actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NahQm93.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Overview of Interviews Conducted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the outset, efforts were made to avoid imposing reductive, externally constructed understandings of insecurity, with researchers providing a series of open-ended questions to flesh out a picture of local perceptions. Participants were asked to describe the main forms of insecurity in their locality, the type of actors they identified as responsible for insecurity, those actors they considered to be the main providers of security and the characteristics of these different individuals or groups. Researchers focused on how respondents viewed organised crime, terrorism and other expressions of insecurity, but particular care was taken to ensure initial questions did not lead with these terms. The findings were refined via a verification workshop hosted by RUSI and CR in Abuja in January 2024, integrating a mix of local practitioners, government representatives, civil society delegates and regional experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By collecting data across three case study contexts, and drawing on supplementary data for a fourth locality, the project sought to prioritise depth over breadth. Its analysis does not cover every form of insecurity across a state as large and diverse as Nigeria, concentrating instead on specific hotspots in the northeast and northwest. However, by combining interview-based research in areas afflicted by chronic instability with wider political-economy analysis, the project identifies trends and patterns that may also be relevant across other parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most discussions with officials and civil society organisations were conducted in English, many other stakeholder engagements featured a mix of local languages and dialects (Hausa, Kanuri, Fulbe and Karekare). Extensive notes were taken, but data collectors did not produce full transcripts (based on audio recordings) due to security concerns. As a result, participant input may be paraphrased in places, but the authors have attempted to cross-check and corroborate the meaning where relevant. In light of the sensitivity of the topic and the potential risks involved, all participants have also been anonymised. Finally, references made to donor perceptions, narratives and interests help to supplement and contextualise local perspectives and experiences, but should not be seen as an exhaustive appraisal of external or national interventions, which would go beyond the scope of this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the data is organised into three chapters. Chapter I disaggregates key sources of insecurity as viewed by community-level participants, examining their mechanics, resonance and impact; the factors potentially shaping these experiences; and, where relevant, perceived discrepancies between the priorities of local, national and international stakeholders. This is contextualised within secondary literature to help to interpret respondent feedback in relation to the existing evidence base. Chapter II explores the mechanisms conditioning these examples of lived insecurity, assessing how they fit within a wider system of violence and instability. The report concludes with a series of policy implications and recommendations for government and donor approaches, suggesting improvements for how they collectively respond to violence in northern Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-local-perceptions-of-insecurity&quot;&gt;I. Local Perceptions of Insecurity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines local perceptions of Nigeria’s threat landscape, drawing on interview data from community networks across Borno, Yobe and Kaduna to gauge the mechanics and impact – whether real or imagined – of different forms of violence, while also considering any juxtaposition with established donor and governmental narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the modalities outlined below offer a snapshot of sentiments across three specific states and should not be treated as a comprehensive or entirely representative reflection of national realities. These findings are subject to environmental sensitivities, personal proclivities, imperfect knowledge and political interests, resulting in an authentic, but inherently reductive, interpretation of lived insecurity across particular moments and spaces. At the same time, Nigerian social discourse and its attendant assumptions are often conditioned by what Andrew Walker calls a “continual crisis of epistemology”, with information refracted (or filtered) through informal associations and ethnic affiliation rather than “reliable institutions of record”. According to Walker, “how one knows something … [consequently becomes] as much to do with who you are, as what it is”, leaving the veracity of local claims sometimes hard to discern. Given the importance from a programmatic and policy perspective of appreciating how rumour and supposition can have a material effect on Nigeria’s social relations and the viability of external engagement, efforts have been made to corroborate, caveat and contextualise these (sometimes competing) narratives within the wider literature where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;violent-extremism&quot;&gt;Violent Extremism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite almost two decades of counterinsurgency across Nigeria’s northeast, and claims that Boko Haram had been “technically defeated” in 2015, extremism – in its various guises – remains a widespread concern among respondents, especially for those in Borno and Yobe. While their modality, distribution and intensity may fluctuate, rampant levels of violence – such as suicide bombings, sexual abuse, kidnappings, arson, looting and assassinations – persist, with descriptions of sundry attacks against military instillations and civilian targets, from “mosques, markets and motor-parks” to clinics, schools and telecommunication infrastructure. Abductions, “mass-casualty” events, and the burning of villages appear routine, perpetrated by “swarms” of young men traversing Borno’s scrubland on cheap Chinese motorcycles. Media reports substantiate these accounts, cataloguing “almost-daily” incidents as militants “roam the countryside with impunity”: deploying drones and makeshift roadblocks, raiding hospitals, and employing hit-and-run tactics. At the same time, local interviewees maintain that “tax-tortion” – whether in the form of cash (naira and/or CFA francs), cattle, crops or fish – continues unabated, occasionally elicited under the rubric of “Zakat” or “Jizya” (protection levies on non-Muslims), but more often coaxed via blackmail or intimidation. As one resident summarised: “most people in the northeast have had to contribute something to [Boko Haram] … just to be able to keep on their way”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there have been important shifts in the insurgency’s scope, tactics and disposition over time, with several respondents distinguishing between metropolitan and rural experiences. Originally drawn from a cluster of youth gangs and dissident sects in the provincial capital of Maiduguri, Boko Haram’s complexion and capabilities have continually fluctuated in response to internal politics and exogenous pressures. Mohammed Yusuf’s “imaginary state within a state” – a network of Sharia courts, religious police, businesses and rudimentary social services – differed from the hijrah (migration) characterising offshoots like the “Kanamma Commune” (later dubbed the “Nigerian Taliban”), and its rustic enclave in Yobe. This early (and legal) incarnation of Boko Haram – the Yusufiyya – was effectively a “counter-elite” enmeshed in the city suburbs, able to “swim with Maiduguri’s social currents” and exploit highly localised grievances. Its cosmic tropes and radical ideology – an aberration of mainstream Salafism – were similarly considered an “urban phenomenon”, diverging from syncretic forms of Islam popular in the “bush”. Additionally, despite widespread notions of almajirai (Quranic students with an apparent “lack of marketable skills”) – forming much of its initial membership, the group’s profile was fairly diverse (if oppidan), attracting a small minority of secondary school graduates and university dropouts alongside the occupants of satellite shantytowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a violent security crackdown in 2009, the extrajudicial killing of Yusuf himself, and destruction of the Ibn Taymiyyah Centre (Boko Haram’s first nucleus), the movement – reassembled under the leadership of Abubaker Shekau – conducted a spate of assassinations across northeastern municipalities, targeting military officials, religious authorities, and politicians affiliated with the ruling All Nigeria Peoples Party. Often concentrated in impoverished, ethnically mixed and “poorly serviced” neighbourhoods – such as Bulumkutu, Bulabulin and Gomari – these patterns indicated both a “well-developed” web of informers and a focus on “settling local scores”. Gradually, however, reports referenced a surge in robberies, prison breaks and attacks on so-called “immoral spaces” – churches, bars and schools – across Maiduguri, Potiskum and Damaturu. Violence seemingly increased in proportion to “military repression” and assumed a “less discerning and [ever-] more brutal” methodology marked by bombings in Jos, Kano, Kaduna and Abuja (including strikes on the Federal Police headquarters and UN building in 2011).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imposition of emergency measures accelerated this diffusion, exporting instability to the countryside. Establishing safe havens across the Sambisa Forest, Gwoza Hills, Kirenowa and Guijba, the group raided “garrison towns” and local outposts, opting to coerce compliance from a “wary peasantry” and exercise “semi-territorial control” in areas vacated by Nigerian security forces. The transition from street thuggery to rural insurgency probably accounts for a concurrent “surge in civilian fatalities” – the Global Terrorism Database catalogued 1,153 incidents between 2012 and 2014, the majority featuring soft targets and private property – as well as “Boko Haram’s … growing reliance on conscription and monetary compensation to replenish its ranks”. In many cases, jihadist governance became synonymous with “wanton destruction and plunder” – abductions, sexual violence, cattle rustling, extortion, vandalism and the persecution of village elders (bulamas and lawans) – although studies identify at least some variation. Across northern Cameroon, for instance, militants supposedly “spent large sums buying the support of traditional chiefs”, while Hilary Matfess describes disparate experiments in local administration, from the roll-out of Quranic schools to marriage ceremonies, food distribution, and eclectic forms of pseudo-civic largesse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logic and scale of coverage shifted again, peaking between 2013 and 2015 with complex attacks on military bases and the capture of several urban centres including Madagali, Bara, Banki, Mubi, Gwoza and outlying districts of Maiduguri. Spanning a region roughly the size of Belgium (encompassing 70% of Borno and tracts of Yobe and Adamawa), this new polity – “Boko Haram Land” – reflected both a concerted attempt at “state-building” – imitating the language, aesthetic and iconography of the Islamic State – and a fragmentation of the group’s internal structure. Beneath a general increase in violence – responsible for approximately 20,000 deaths in 2014 alone – experts cite territorial expansion as driving the proliferation of different cells led by “emirs” with “very little relationship to one another”. Those along the Lake Chad shoreline, for instance, appeared far more “commercially oriented” than franchises further south, offering a precursor to later splits between Islamic State West Africa (ISWAP) and a rump outfit – using the JAS moniker – under Shekau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Multi-National Joint Task Force’s intervention in early 2015, accompanied by the further mobilisation of local militiamen, Boko Haram’s statelet quickly contracted. The corollary seemed to be a precipitous (if temporary) decline in fatalities – 2,000 people per year were killed between 2016 and 2018, a fifth of casualties in 2015 – with operations largely confined to Sambisa, Gwoza and marshlands around Lake Chad. These assessments chime with feedback from interviewees, which drew a sharp contrast between the comparative stability of downtown Maiduguri – “the situation … is now probably as good as it has … been in the last 10 years” – and the ongoing vulnerability of “hard-to-reach” LGAs such as Damboa, and tumbuns (islets) across Lake Chad itself. Although residents can “move … freely” and no longer experience “bomb blasts [or] open killings” in the city centre, the security context remains “dynamic”, with insurgents intermittently cutting off road access and necessitating “military escorts” for commuters. Others referred to kidnappings, car thefts and ambushes along major highways, particularly the Maiduguri–Nganzai–Monguno axis, with spikes evident during the rainy season. The introduction of so-called “super-camps” – fortified urban strongholds – exacerbated these issues, reducing much of the northeastern interior to a “no-go” subsidiary of Boko Haram’s “protection economy”. As Jean-Herve Jezequel and Vincent Foucher corroborate: “African armies and their allies were often unable to restore security in the countryside … civil servants could or would not follow the military into insecure zones, leaving vast areas run by skeleton administrations and few, if any, public services”. Against this backdrop, interviewees described widespread taxation via “fake” or improvised checkpoints, with accounts from northern Yobe, including Yunusari and Yusufari, citing specific demands for “new naira” (so fighters could replace outdated notes and foreign currency). Reporting from Zabarmari offers a similar vignette, with subsistence farmers reliant on “peace-deals” (and accompanying payment schemes) to work their rice fields, which left them susceptible to extreme, often unpredictable violence. Ironically, reductions in aggregate levels of conflict have compounded the problem, enticing rural internally displaced persons (IDPs) – loggers, herders and fishermen – to return home, and thereby expose themselves to renewed forms of harassment and intimidation. Others have allegedly been compelled by state authorities and local “big men” who are keen to project a sense of normality, precipitating massacres in far-flung villages like Mafa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, Boko Haram – as a messy constellation of sub- and splinter groups – continues to be seen as a dexterous, highly resilient insurgency, despite the impact of military attrition, internecine fighting, and defections via Operation Safe Corridor (a government-run demobilisation programme). At the same time, respondents acknowledged rural “hardships” and “dwindling food supplies” stemming from the conflict, with many communities “too scared” to cultivate outside the perimeters of nearby military bases. Disrupted harvests, poor yields, seed shortages, shock pricing, the lack of mechanisation and adaptive practices, and limited access to provincial markets or water-points have in turn accelerated a collapse in agricultural output, leaving 3.8 million people across the northeast facing starvation. Accentuated by longstanding ecological stressors, several interviewees tied this malnutrition to a concerted rise in local crime rates, reflecting a vicious cycle of vulnerability shaped, but not defined, by violent extremism (VE). As one resident summarised: “food insecurity, increases in poverty, population growth, … lack of jobs and unemployment. These were … issues [that] drove the insurgency in the first place, but the insurgency has only made … these things worse”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;contested-understandings-of-culpability&quot;&gt;Contested Understandings of Culpability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fixation on terrorism in Borno and Yobe, many participants were vague about notions of agency and culpability, conflating rival outfits – JAS, ISWAP, Lakurawa and Ansaru – under a generic “Boko Haram” label or lumping them together as those “in the bush”. While not universal, these ambiguities are analogous with past studies, which preface that “[national and international stakeholders] had opinions [on the nature of VE] … often at variance from one another”. As Walker acknowledges, “the experiences of Boko Haram are so [diverse] that it has led to general confusion over what they actually are”. Inherent methodological issues offer a partial explanation (for example, security restrictions, limited trust, self-censorship or insufficient sampling). The realities of a congested, highly unstable social ecosystem may also be to blame, as appellations are adopted, imposed or shed when expedient, and the membership of different groups remains fairly fluid. Stig Jarle Hansen similarly cites an early propensity for “inflating attacks supposedly conducted by Boko Haram but [really] committed by local strongmen and conflict entrepreneurs”, leaving the insurgency a convenient branding exercise for eclectic actors and interests. Crucially, many of these narrative “genres” are partisan and identity-based; a form of mythmaking “repeated in … echo chambers … until eventually so many people believe it that it becomes – functionally … true”. The result is a contentious, heavily politicised information environment, one criticised for being “big on speculation, short on evidence”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, several respondents nevertheless identified important discrepancies in the behaviour and approach of different conflict parties, which seemingly conditioned how communities navigate, and interact with, competing conceptions of militant authority. Some, for instance, described JAS as comparatively “aggressive”, killing “indiscriminately” and relying on kidnappings to compensate for the lack of new recruits (and closure of rural banks). Such accounts align with the wider literature, suggesting the group “rarely prioritised the provision of [local] services” under (or after) Shekau and made “no [real] effort to [offer] a vision of a future society or concrete benefits … [to secure] public support”. With little investment in administrative structures or attempts to “win over hearts and minds”, JAS lacked the institutional capacity (and inclination) to rule beyond intimidation, “control, and compliance”. At the same time, Shekau’s hyper-extreme interpretations of al-wala wa-l-bara, takfir, and ghanima left a narrow “constituency” incapable of sustaining populist strategies common among other Salafi-Jihadist organisations. As Michael Nwankpa and Abdulbasit Kassim argue, JAS is more akin to the socially insulated “personality cult” of Joseph Kony’s Lord’s Resistance Army, relying on forced conscription, coercion and spoils to offset the immaturity (or absence) of its state-building project. Following the collapse of hideouts in Sambisa, and Shekau’s death in 2021, these dynamics have persisted, with loosely coordinated cells acting like “roving bandits”. As one interviewee summarised: “they are ignorant, many of them don’t even know what the caliphate is, they don’t understand politics or governance systems”. Another respondent elaborated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don’t think it is about jihad anymore. A lot of the fighters … were drawn into it not because of ideology but opportunity. That opportunity has [reduced] as the group weakened … the remnants don’t have any … aim, they are just … looting … for survival … This is criminality under the label of a terrorist group, [but] it doesn’t make them any less dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a third stated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;constant attacks by ISWAP and the security forces … have left [JAS] with no options other than to resort to basic criminality like theft, kidnap-for-ransom, and armed robbery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, ISWAP was considered more “predictable”, prioritising operations against the Nigerian army over the persecution of local Muslim populations. Multiple respondents claimed “[Islamic State]-controlled areas are better … [they] are still trying to recruit people through indoctrination, … trying to get people to join them”. Drawing on statistics from the Global Terrorism Database, Edward Stoddard shows clear disparities in coverage and casualty rates, with 61.4% of attacks up to mid-2021 focusing on military and police targets and only 27.4% launched against civilians, an almost perfect inversion of those perpetrated by JAS. Studies indicate the “trappings of an IS-Central like aspirant pseudo-state”, with the group mimicking a manhaj approach to “provisionary governance” and “eudaemonic legitimation”. Having centralised much of its decision-making, ISWAP’s day-to-day activities appear comparatively “rational” and bureaucratic, allowing greater consistency in the supply of education, healthcare, judicial mediation, price-capped goods, and protection from bandits and “corrupt officials”. This is not to imply a benign form of civic management or cohabitation – numerous reports recount massacres of communities blamed for contravening the group’s strictures – but a concerted effort to co-opt and consolidate, wielding taxation as a “technology of rule”. In contrast to the “sectarianism and predatory violence” of “parent and parallel organisations”, ISWAP has purposefully enmeshed itself into the mainstays of Lake Chad’s economy, from farming and fishing to pepper cultivation. Digging wells, disseminating fertiliser, creating provincial “councils”, preventing cattle rustling, resolving disputes and reviving lapsed policies – like distributing micro-loans – all enable insurgents to maximise (and exploit) regional trade as a sustainable basis for their financial model. This comes with collateral benefits – such as basic services, security, mobility and land access – which are attractive to residents starved of any real alternatives, meaning conformity should arguably be understood as a coping mechanism rather than a signal of wholesale support. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests ISWAP has developed a far more symbiotic relationship with its host population than JAS, extracting rent from households that in turn profit from a relatively stable commercial environment, while avoiding the “excesses” of Nigerian security forces. As a result, locals may have (incidentally or deliberately) acquired a stake in the group’s success, leaving it increasingly difficult to “dislodge”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an environment where “virtually all violence” has become homogenised under the “Boko Haram umbrella”, these are nuances with profound implications for how extremism is perceived, navigated, and sustained among the grassroots. Making the case that terrorist organisations are not monolithic, Alex Thurston, among others, emphasises the importance of disaggregating between local experiences of militancy to ensure that interventions respond to the motivations, strategies and social dynamics conditioning jihadism across different areas. This is easier said than done – especially given the discrepancies in language used between policymakers and local stakeholders, and within communities themselves – but remains essential for the relevance, resonance and performance of national and international approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;banditry&quot;&gt;Banditry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With VE (largely) relegated to peripheral townships or the “bush”, public and governmental attention has gradually shifted on to other forms of insecurity, most notably “banditry”, a “composite crime” (encompassing cattle rustling, kidnap-for-ransom, blood minerals, extortion rackets, pillaging, and sexual and gender-based violence) proliferating across the northwest and stretches of north-central. Incidents have risen from 124 in 2018 to 1,031 in 2022, conducted by itinerant, heavily armed gangs strung along the margins of Kaduna, Sokoto, Katsina and Zamfara. Echoing accounts from other interviewees, a youth leader explained: “[they] invade communities openly and kill people recklessly, they forcefully take their victims … into the thick forest … They can attack you on the road, in the community, on farms, or at school”. Mounted on motorbikes (okadas), the mobility, weaponry and (amorphic) pathology of these groups have induced widespread fear across communities, with claims gunmen “can reach anywhere … whenever they want” and “kidnap at their own discretion”. Acknowledging the scale of hostilities, one vigilante admitted “there is no day that you don’t hear of a bandit attack … we are doing our best, but it is out of control”, while another respondent suggested up to “80% of [their neighbourhood] had been destroyed”. Even politicians are reportedly “lobbying airlines to add flights … from Abuja” so they can avoid taking federal highways. Crucially, the coverage seems to have diffused across rural and urban areas alike, adapting to (and creating) new forms of social upheaval. One security stakeholder said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People moved to the villages to escape [banditry], [but] then it followed them there, so people moved to towns, only for attacks to them reach there. Now it is … possible in the big cities – Kaduna and Zaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another noted that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They threaten the whole of the north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its intensity, the actual dynamics of this “epidemic” remain contentious, due in part to donor fixations on jihadism (and a related lack of empirical data for other iterations of violent behaviour) and the ephemerality of “banditry” itself. Regional instability is not new – armed robbery has afflicted trans-Saharan caravan routes since the early 1900s – but the breadth and commercialisation of recent violence does appear distinctive. In the past decade, disputes over wetlands, grazing rights, ecological pressures, and the ready availability of firearms (particularly after Libya’s collapse in 2011) have seemingly led to increasing resource competition between Hausa farmers and Fulani herders in localities like Igabi. Crucially, these tensions coincide with long-held views of pastoralists as social “outsiders” and “settlers” in the northwest (colloquially dubbed the “Wild Wild West”), where nomadic communities are often among the “poorest inhabitants” of the most deprived areas, with limited access to schooling or employment. They also have little clout over policymaking, with land reforms in favour of sedentary practices and infrastructure projects coming at the expense of Fulani hamlets and cattle tracks. Accentuated by bureaucratic mismanagement and the institutionalisation of “autochthonic” policies, herdsmen have arguably been forced into “pursuing alternative means” to survive, with some taking up arms to protest their “conjugated oppression”, occasionally through brigandage. Importantly, while this is one symptom of a far wider crisis involving inter-communal violence across Nigeria’s Middle Belt (much of which lies outside the bounds of this research), interviewees from the three focal states generally interpreted such issues through the specific prism of banditry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marked by a profusion of “self-defence” militias (such as Yan Banga, Yan Sa Kai and Kato da Gora) and so-called “jungle justice”, these cycles of conflict have gradually assumed an ethnic flavour, with popular anxieties around “indigenes’ rights” – spurred on by elite demagoguery – leaving many residents preconditioned to blame Fulanis for latent social problems. Several interviewees from Kaduna, for instance, used “bandit” and “Fulani” synonymously, reflecting a wider conflation of pastoralism and criminality in Nigeria’s civic discourse. However, the threat also seems to “defy neat categorisation”, with a patchwork of 80 to 120 different gangs, mostly based in Zamfara, displaying their own tactics, behaviours, and motivations. As James Barnett and Murtala Rufai argue: “[they] do not constitute … a coherent insurgency of any sort”. In some cases, chauvinism, kinship and social solidarities were salient in attracting young nomads and co-ethnic “outsiders” from Mali, Senegal, Niger, Guinea and Cameroon. Elsewhere, clans neither spoke Fulfulde (a common dialect among Fulani communities) nor had any compunction in attacking one another, with polyglot support drawn from Berbers, Tuaregs, Kanuri, Kanembu and Yedina. Despite genealogical ties to the pastoral economy, banditry is not exclusive to, nor necessarily a symptom of, pastoralism itself, but involves an assortment of occupational and ethnic groups, many of which deliberately target local herders given their liquidity and geographic vulnerability. In reality, the operative logic of these militants often seems pecuniary, incentivised more by “profit, personal enrichment, and money-making” than any clear or consistent sense of identity and/or ideology. As a security official summarised: “[they] are not religiously inclined and don’t have a political programme or ambition as a collective”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their modes of accumulation similarly vary, depending on circumstance, context and the idiosyncrasies of specific Kachalla (leaders). While livestock raiding was previously considered a seasonal (and sustainable) staple of pastoral culture and rural masculinity, its scope rapidly expanded after 2011, emerging as an organised, highly industrial enterprise. For example, reports reference a surge in “black cattle markets” (selling illicit stock at cut-rate costs) across Kaduna, Katsina and Zamfara, tied to complex supply chains that reached outlets in Ibadan and Lagos, middlemen along the border, and dealers in Benin and Niger. Falling beef prices, depleted herds and widespread displacement have, however, diminished these margins since 2019, with Kingsley L Madueke and others noting that the largest cattle owners across the northwest are now bandits themselves. This likely explains interviewees’ (almost exclusive) preoccupation with abductions, as militants have sought to diversify their revenue streams. Official figures claim 16,016 people were kidnapped in Zamfara between 2015 and 2022, with incidents rising by 1,498% over a seven-year period, although the actual numbers are likely higher given chronic levels of under-reporting. Originally focused on specific individuals, mass attacks have become increasingly common due to their greater leverage and pay-outs, conditioned, in part, by gendered dynamics, as interviewees acknowledged. One stated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once they attack, they will kidnap lots but also kill people. From my understanding, they will [usually] kidnap people they think are easy targets, who won’t pose much resistance, so it is often women or children … they are more likely to kill men, particularly active aged men they may think are a threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second respondent indicated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Their main targets [are] those that they can get money from … they target women and children because they are easier to take, but also because the men normally control the money and so can get the funds to [cover] the ransoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Men can be killed as they are viewed as a potential threat, but they can also be kidnapped. Women and children are kidnapped, raped and taken hostage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broad trends may be discernible – high profile, targeted abductions appear to be more typical in metropolitan settings or transit hubs, whereas “opportunistic raids” characterise outlying roads, schools, communes and remote villages – but the modalities are flexible. Bandits collaborate with local informants in certain areas, and rely on overwhelming force – including “gun-trucks”, “large numbers” and indiscriminate seizures – in others, with participants recalling repeated “invasions” of the same villages across Kachia, Kajuru and Chikun. Elsewhere, they have reportedly ventured into goldmining, imposing “protection fees” on concession companies, setting up their own operations, or appropriating land and assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although much of this activity was interpreted as predatory and extractive, past studies also present examples of rent-seeking behaviour that have almost become “proto-statal”, with “criminal sovereigns” assuming “responsibility for security, arbitration, and the means of production”. James Barnett, for instance, cites figures like Dogo Gide, a notorious Kaduna kingpin, “regulating farming through neo-feudal sharecropping arrangements”, while another, Kachalla Bello Turji, “builds mosques” and “dispenses harsh justice against petty criminals”. In Zamfara, so-called “coupeurs de routes” or “road-cutters” not only act as highwaymen but have launched their own shuttle services, exploiting (self-induced) instability to monopolise local trucking and transit markets. Of course, these anecdotes do not necessarily contradict respondent perceptions, as they depend on, and are regulated by, coercion. Additionally, any experiences of incipient “governance” are clearly disparate, parochial and small-scale – akin to the eccentricities of what Mancur Olson calls “stationary bandits”, where groups “stop roaming and start erecting tax infrastructure” in exchange for public goods, rather than a coherent political project. Crucially, however, they also allude to a heterogeneous landscape in which militants can, at times, be seen to either offer a more plausible and immediate form of security than the state itself or compel residents into agreeing bilateral “peace pacts” (that ignore the state entirely) as a means of mitigating local brigandage, as a police officer conceded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Villages outside town do make payments to bandits … it is not so much about providing security but … ensuring they are not attacked. [They] view it as necessary for their survival … during harvest season you will see that they pack away some of the crop in lieu of financial payment. I know that some families have also married their daughters to the families of people in the bandit groups in the expectation that connection will guarantee their safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cooperation, even as a coping mechanism, can reinforce the exclusion and persecution of suspect communities, particularly rural herdsmen who are assumed to be complicit in bandit activity given their need to traverse and occupy the same spaces – leaving vulnerable constituencies trapped in a cycle of intimidation and incrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-banditterror-nexus&quot;&gt;A Bandit–Terror Nexus?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the plurality of “loose, opportunistic … and adaptive” bandit networks continuously splintering or subsuming one another, clear linkages with violent extremists are hard to determine. Government officials, donors and regional commentators often express concern over a possible “jihadisation of banditry” in the northwest, mimicking familiar methodologies used by Al-Qaeda and Islamic State affiliates across the Sahel, and creating a “land-bridge” between discrete VE insurgencies. At the same time, the scale of violence and insecurity has already precipitated legislative and policy changes, with federal authorities enhancing security coverage and proscribing gangs such as Yan Ta’adda and Yan Bindiga as terrorist organisations – meaning law enforcement does not have to “catch” members committing specific “acts”, as any association with these outfits is now an offence. But the realities of this relationship are murkier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extant evidence, and feedback from interviewees, suggest three (likely overlapping) possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disillusioned “Boko Haram” fighters are migrating northwest due to military pressures in the northeast.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a mutually beneficial connection between bandit and extremist circles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Committed elements of Boko Haram are proactively trying to establish a new cross-regional frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies describe the longstanding coexistence of brigands and VE sub-groups across northwest and north-central. Ansaru relocated its operations to Dansadau, Kwasa-Kwasa and Old Kuywello in 2014, for instance, while JAS cultivated offshoots around Kano a year later, and eventually shifted its “bomb fabricators” to Rijana, Igabi and Chikun in 2021. Interviewees have also recounted ad hoc episodes of cooperation – usually functional or mercenary in scope – related to “arms trafficking, intelligence sharing, smuggling and outsourcing … [along with] logistics, exchange of currencies, and guerilla training”. Facilitated in part by shared geography – daji ya hada su (“the forest connects them”) – much of this seemingly coalesced around specific personalities, exemplified by Adam Bitri, an acolyte of Yusuf, “teaming up” with local bandits to form a “crime–terror syndicate” across Zaria, Birnin and Gwari in 2019. That said, the “embryonic and intermittent activity of [such] … entities [often] made it difficult to [fully understand] their ideology [and] objectives”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a renewed army offensive and internal feuding between ISWAP and JAS now shrinking the space available for extremists in the northeast, these dynamics may be evolving as fighters are pushed further westward. Military commanders have increasingly warned that: “jihadists and terrorists [are] infiltrateing the ranks of bandits”, and suggested “banditry is … heading towards terrorism”. Several respondents likewise outlined “creeping” signs of VE influence – “black flags”, religious tropes and cosmic imagery – transforming or acculturating criminal outfits across Kaduna, Katsina and Zamfara, and leading to an apparent conflation of moral and discursive boundaries in various areas as rural thugs use “Islamic chants” to legitimise their activities or rally support. At the same time, stakeholders identified growing similarities in the tactics of different groups, with kidnap-for-ransom operations increasingly resembling Boko Haram’s methods in Chibok and Dapchi. Notably, interviewee and media testimony both repeatedly drew on the same incident – the mass abduction of 300 schoolboys in Kankara – to substantiate this point, although Al Chuckwuma Okoli and others also cite bandits downing a Nigerian fighter jet and launching complex assaults on military targets as being indicative of “audacious attacks that were hitherto restricted to insurgents”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this does not necessarily imply convergence or capture at a corporate level, as referenced by several experts who attributed the appearance of extremist iconography to specific individuals (usually suspected migrants from the northeast) acting within, rather than on behalf of, wider groups. Elsewhere, Barnett, Rufa’I and Abdulaziz argue that the perpetrators of Kankara – a provincial gang led by Auwal Daudawa – invented a VE connection to “up the ante” in ransom negotiations, while their previous attempts to formalise a bond with JAS collapsed due to “stealing, rustling” and drug abuse. Additionally, evidence suggests bandits may recycle, imitate or appropriate Boko Haram’s rubric and symbology as a convenient way of threatening communities and raising their profile, but show limited appetite for actually “adopting a jihadist ideology or political economy”. As one study observed, the power of these cartels leaves them with “little to gain – and much to lose – by subordinating themselves to a [sectarian] organisation and its rules”, while their polycentric and volatile disposition undermines the durability of any alliance. In some cases, interviewees suggested the inverse is more apparent, with extremists displaying bandit-like tendencies. This shift is perhaps contingent on circumstance, rather than strategy, as displaced fighters become subsidiaries of local gangs or request permission to operate on their turf. As an NGO worker summarised:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Those in the northeast had the opportunity for terrorism, [and] the northwest now offers an opportunity to make money in the form of banditry. These people are used to living in the bush, know how to fight, and have a disregard for human life. So, they use it as an opportunity and flee [west].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, indications from Zamfara also allude to a parallel process of organisational outreach, with ISWAP (rather than JAS) attempting to “sell” their expertise as part of a wider effort to fundraise and facilitate access to regional smuggling routes. In contrast to arrangements in the northeast, where criminal networks are usually subservient to, or extorted by, Boko Haram’s offshoots, stakeholders also implied these “official representatives” may be explicitly instructed to abide by the rules of, and appease, their hosts, potentially reflecting a shared understanding over spheres of authority and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid these evolving conflict systems, the data therefore exposes ongoing gaps in governmental and societal understandings of bandits’ organisational structure, operational strategy, and leadership, with numerous stakeholders describing their difficulty distinguishing between terrorism and organised crime:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[Nigeria has] myriads of violent conflicts ongoing … at the same time … it is so confusing, and many people lack the understanding to properly categorise these conflicts to identify the proper intervention to be given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this arguably reflects the fungibility of different forms of insecurities, with overlapping membership, tactics and discourse characterising VE and provincial banditry, these analogies are often context-specific and conditional. Given the heterogeneity of criminal networks across the northwest, and the jumble of cells and splinters operating under the Boko Haram umbrella, there is consequently a risk in over-extending the “terrorism” label without a sufficient appreciation for the discrete logics shaping violence across disparate areas, even if they share similarities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;petty-crime-and-gangsterism&quot;&gt;Petty Crime and Gangsterism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside high-profile threats such as VE and banditry, participants from Borno, Yobe and Kaduna all emphasised more quotidian concerns over the impact of gangsterism and juvenile delinquency on city life. Prosaic expressions of “urban banditry” – muggings, phone-snatching, burglary, harassment and rape – appeared common across subaltern neighbourhoods of Maiduguri, with groups of young (often vicenarian) men extorting residents and running prostitution rings. While the fear and “effects” of this insecurity were ubiquitous, respondents described particular “hotspots” of illicit activity, usually concentrated in dense, low-income districts – for example, Gwoidamgari, Bolori, Dala, Maisandari, Railway and Gwange – characterised by poor social amenities and a lack of basic infrastructure. Partially mapping on to old Boko Haram recruitment hubs, these areas were disparaged by respondents as “criminal enclaves”, with surrounding communities criticised for their apparent “complicity” in deviant behaviour. Although the specifics tended to be highly localised, interviewees offered a ready-made topography of social ills, ranging from alcoholism (in Old Maiduguri), cocaine and “Penta” injections (in Mafoni Green-House) to cheap marijuana (in Galadima), scammers and fraudsters (in Barka de Zuma), and turf wars (in the New Government Reserved Area). One security officer conceded that “it is now anathema to build or live in the outskirts as you become a target”, with other stakeholders citing “rampant” violence around the post-office, Monday Market and various bridges and bypasses. Analogous trends were supposedly evident in municipalities like Potiskum and Damaturu, with participants referencing pervasive crime rates across slumlands and outlying estates (such as Tashan Kurma, Pompomari and Nayinawa), commercial zones, water points and major roadways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be prefaced that anecdotal data may not always amount to objective reality. Like many other countries, Nigeria’s public discourse routinely frames young, impoverished and/or unemployed men as drivers of disorder and insecurity, suggesting respondents might be predisposed to blame youth culture for any infraction or social grievance. These sentiments are fed, in part, by the propensity of elites to induce “moral panic”, manufacturing so-called “folk devils” to criminalise or disenfranchise specific groups – from street children and almajirai to displaced populations, alleged drug addicts, and/or poor communities – as a means of projecting or preserving power. Although such (“gerontocratic and patriarchal”) methods of social control assume different forms and flavours, they often have a shared resonance, influencing media coverage which can in turn reshape the local imaginary. While this does not void the authenticity or legitimacy of participant input, their perceptions may therefore be conditioned by, and instrumentalised within, a wider discursive landscape that is not always substantiated by empirical evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, many interviewees attributed neighbourhood criminality to the same structural problems: unemployment; rapid, unregulated urbanisation; deprivation; mounting living costs; and lags in education. Such dynamics pre-date Boko Haram, with officials estimating 30% to 35% of Borno’s population had already coalesced around Maiduguri by the 1990s, due (partially) to desertification and reductions in arable farmland. The demographic shifts and social tensions accompanying this “unplanned sprawl” not only undermined the ability of state institutions, or coterminous patronage networks, to satisfy local expectations but accelerated the decline of hereditary rule (in terms of moral authority and popular legitimacy) and its associated surveillance systems. The resulting lack of leadership, direction and opportunity has arguably pushed many inhabitants into the informal or (much smaller) illicit economy, with one study summarising: “[people] come to the city in search of a livelihood, the bubble burst and they realise there is nothing there. That’s when they become easy prey for militant organisations”. Successive decades of insurrection and counterinsurgency appeared to exacerbate these trends, contributing towards an (unmanaged) influx of IDPs (reportedly around 800,000 by 2014/15) and a concurrent collapse of provincial industries. As a consequence, affluent boroughs have “virtually merged with poor [given the] increasing rate of poverty even among government workers”, while numerous respondents cited the “desperation” motivating residents “to do bad jobs for a small token of money”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar conclusions were evident across Yobe, with young people considered “trapped”, or having to consort with criminal syndicates for “meaning, purpose, community and [access to cash]”. In describing the scale of urban blight, a vigilante conceded: “[households with] nothing to eat venture into criminality for survival. But [crime] also [grants] them status and meaning … it gives them a social [circle] and [a] form of power”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conditions shaping juvenile delinquency can subsequently be seen as a product of both change and continuity, with the cumulative effects of trauma, dislocation and violence associated with Boko Haram leading to a generation of “street children” reliant on “unconventional” coping strategies, from begging to petty crime (“stealing, shoplifting, snatching, and drug dealing”). Two law enforcement personnel summarised the problem, with the first noting that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The past ten years … have provided space for the proliferation of small arms, thereby resulting in … violent activities including … gangsterism among the youth in Maiduguri. The scourge of Boko Haram … [has] brought about near anarchy and lawlessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[Local] criminals are virtually an offshoot from the impact of [extremist] violence experienced over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees additionally referenced an apparent surge in substance misuse as a symptom and propellant of insecurity, framing the consumption of narcotics (or cheaper derivatives) as a convenient (and steadily normalised) way of “suppressing pain and hunger”. This remains a controversial claim, especially given chronic data deficits, the politicisation of Nigeria’s drug trade and ongoing contestation over the scope and ontology of “addiction” itself. Nevertheless, both respondents and past studies suggest the insurgency and counterinsurgency have not only supplied cover for illicit opioid sales (for example, of Tramodol, codeine and cough syrup), but continued to drive the use of cannabis, Rohypnol, Methamphetamine (colloquially dubbed “Ice”), marijuana and alcohol, alongside an assortment of crude knockoffs (manufactured from Tom-Tom sweets, soda “cocktails”, pawpaw leaves, and/or dried neem or Dogo Yaro). Initially confined to IDP camps and marginal wards like “Kaleri, London Ciki, and Shehuri North”, the problem is now seen as a “crisis within a crisis”, facilitated by militants, pharmacists, police officers and elements of the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) allegedly either peddling drugs themselves or enabling their transit and distribution. The outcome is arguably a vicious circle, with Maiduguri emerging as a conduit for narco-trafficking (reportedly experiencing an increase in trade between 2012 and 2021), which has in turn fed surrounding markets and created widespread physical and financial dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, street thuggery was considered endemic, with decades of conflict lowering the practical and normative barriers to violent behaviour. While this mobilisation often takes the form of ad hoc peer-to-peer networks, coalescing or dissipating at particular moments based on need and expediency, other affiliations appear more organised. Razor gangs such as G44, G19, the Shilla Boys or the Marlians (named after the British-Nigerian singer, Naira Marley, who is not associated with the group) were described as hierarchical or cult-like, with different “clusters” or neighbourhood franchises sharing a similar aesthetic and coordinating their attacks. This raised questions over leadership: their composition may be local – drawing on a disillusioned under-class of orphans, school dropouts, road-side touters and scavengers – but several interviewees inferred a degree of top-down control, with one respondent describing “shadowy godfathers” “plying [youths] with drugs and money” in exchange for loyalty. How far such entities can therefore be understood as a proxy for elite competition, rather than an organic response to peri-urban insecurities, remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these explanations allude to a permissive environment created in part by the effects of VE, local criminality cannot be solely attributed to Boko Haram or its legacies. References to despondency, social frustrations and financial pressures resemble tropes from the 1980s, as do claims of “parental negligence” and a lack of domestic supervision. Despite emphasising the moral failings of “Yaran Zamani ne” (“children today”) for example, respondent preoccupations with a break-down of the family unit reflect cultural anxieties evident in “Hausaland” for generations. Disorder has likewise been a recurrent feature of Nigeria’s prebendal politics since the late 1990s, with street gangs conjured up or rented out as accessories of electoral campaigns. Numerous studies reference the use of young men as disposable muscle, deployed to “smash … polling units and intimidate voters”, “browbeat people to attend rallies”, “fill ballot boxes”, and carry out the “errands and dirty deeds” of gubernatorial and/or federal candidates. Although disproportionately concentrated in the South-South, interviewees across Kaduna, Borno and Yobe cast this hooliganism as the latest iteration of a well-established “thug-for-hire” industry – managed, funded and occasionally armed (with rifles, machetes and makeshift clubs) by the country’s “political class” (the so-called “Ogas-at-the-top”). Governors, in particular, have a long history of “running their states like personal fiefs”, with some in the north allegedly re-hatting militiamen as “forest rangers” or recruiting muscle through government-backed “rehabilitation” schemes. Other respondents framed gangs as youth organisations or party cadres, with their leaders disguised as “chairmen” or “secretaries”. Whatever the packaging, these linkages often appear transactional and transient, with the likes of Ecomog, Yan-Kalare and Yan-Daba receiving stipends as a retainer during election seasons. However, such arrangements also have longer-term implications, with spates of impunity – and related surges in resourcing, equipment and manpower – helping to facilitate access to other illicit markets (including drug dealing, racketeering, kidnapping and, further south, oil-bunkering and piracy). The outcome of this political–criminal nexus – which Michael Bratton brands a “theatre of violence” – is not just incentivising local groups to offset (fleeting) largesse with additional income-streams, but licensing (or actively enabling) them to exercise new forms of predatory behaviour. As a CSO member summarised:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Youths are given a lot of cash … during campaigns … this … comes easy to them and when it stops they look for avenues to continue getting easy money. This makes them organise themselves as like minds to commit crimes in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;graft-and-extra-legal-violence&quot;&gt;Graft and Extra-Legal Violence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nigerian state has deployed a range of tactics to address these multifaceted, variable and localised forms of insecurity, yet interviews from across Borno, Yobe and Kaduna highlighted how government actors and their affiliates have both directly and indirectly served to generate instability, often through the very measures intended to address it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official responses to local insecurity have previously been criticised as heavy-handed and inconsiderate of the needs of recipient populations, thereby worsening conditions for many communities. For instance, the military’s ban on fishing along the Nigerian shoreline of Lake Chad due to the industry’s apparent financial ties to VE ignored the fact that “people have no alternative”. Shutting down cattle markets similarly contributed to the impoverishment of regional neighbourhoods, while motorcycle bans – intended to temper the mobility of bandit groups and insurgents – restricted residential livelihoods and pushed some into “criminal activity”. Interviewees also attributed the closure of brothels by police in Maiduguri to a concurrent increase in prostitution and crime. This failure to consider the second-order effects of blanket crackdowns highlights the state’s antagonistic response, which has shown little long-term benefit and simultaneously harmed the people such interventions were designed to serve. Violence continues in the northwest despite communication blackouts and prohibitions on livestock transportation or bike use. The consolidation of “garrison towns”, as outlined above, has likewise left rural areas unprotected and having to “contend with payment of taxes to … insurgents”, while an influx of IDPs – often as part of government relocation initiatives – has placed increasing strain on local services and resources, creating tension with host communities. Across Borno, several respondents blamed these displaced populations for surges in economic hardship, drug misuse, criminality and violence, suggesting a popular narrative that state responses have further contributed to cycles of insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heavy-handed approaches, however, extend beyond poorly thought-through interventions to the active participation of government actors in insecurity- generating behaviour. The military has been accused of extrajudicial violence, including the targeted murder of male children, sexual violence, torture and the destruction of villages and crops throughout its activities against JAS and ISWAP. State-perpetrated abuses were particularly acknowledged in Borno, where respondents referenced “indiscriminate” security operations that allegedly included the “widespread” killing of “innocent people without proper investigation”. Violent crackdowns which “failed to distinguish between civilians and jihadists” in the early days of JAS were said to have propelled local radicalisation and recruitment, leaving a legacy of fear and mistrust that continues to constrain civic engagement with state security structures. This is despite improvements in community outreach and official networking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronic mistrust is further exacerbated by “endemic corruption” across the three focal states, which was seen as accentuating insecurity at all levels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From the underlying cause [of insecurity], to the politicisation of resources or lack thereof, to the allocation of resources, to the way that those resources are then even siphoned off, to turning a blind eye [to corruption] and the complete impunity in the justice system. The leadership of this state and country are culpable for the suffering of ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the community level, bribes are commonly paid to receive security coverage (intensifying insecurity for deprived neighbourhoods), and at checkpoints (raising concerns that the security services are profiting from, rather than policing, criminality). This has resulted in a highly unequal provision of security, as “there [is] more … attention given to rich and official or political leaders who live in secured areas, some of who have police escorts as they move about”. Meanwhile, for those who are poor, “either you wait for escort time, if any that day, or be on your own and risk being killed, kidnapped or robbed”. Scholars note that these local modes of corruption, verging on privatisation, are partly incentivised by high-level graft – including the diversion and embezzlement of funds intended for the security services – a view shared by interviewees. Such dynamics have reportedly led to the underfunding and under-resourcing of Nigeria’s military, thereby disincentivising lawful behaviour and motivating low-level criminality to cover basic provisions and salaries. This grand corruption is embodied by the Dasukigate scandal, which saw the former Nigerian National Security Adviser Sambo Dasuki accused of embezzling money intended for the procurement of arms to fight against Islamist insurgencies. Dasuki was first arrested and arraigned in 2015, with his trial most recently adjourned until July 2025. The exploitation that local people are exposed to from the security services has also resulted in the blurring of boundaries between different (in) security actors, as “people will pay at security checkpoints, at insurgent checkpoints, they will pay kidnappers, they will pay criminals to leave them alone”. This subeconomy of illicit payments means that communities are exploited on multiple fronts, compounding pre-existing issues of poverty and unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, rampant corruption appears to have entrenched Nigeria’s security services and political and economic elites in the northern war economy. Across Borno, Yobe and Kaduna, respondents alleged that politicians, government officials, businessmen and members of the police and military were collaborating with, benefiting from or actively backing armed and criminal groups, including those engaged in banditry and/or VE. This was seen as contributing to the persistence of violence and the escalation of insecurity. Interviewees warned that “lots of people have got very rich from the war” and therefore “it is now in their interest to sustain it in order to ensure the continued flow of money”. Research has echoed these claims, highlighting apparent links between various Nigerian elites, illegal mining and banditry; the military’s integration into and control over local economies; and the impact of godfatherism. Accordingly, Emeka Njoku describes the role of “shady practices by military elites in creating and sustaining an atmosphere of violence as a way of ensuring the continued rationale” for funding their presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the weakness or absence of formal services has also driven the proliferation of non- or pseudo-state forces, from community militiamen to organised vigilante outfits like the CJTF. Displaying divergent levels of training, capabilities, and kit (including modern small-arms, spears, cutlasses, Dane guns and rudimentary muskets), these stakeholders were widely considered paramount in restoring neighbourhood security. Cast by many as “heroes, saviours, and champions”, interviewees emphasised the value of their “knowledge of the local landscape”, intelligence gathering capabilities, and community relationships in recapturing and holding territory (as further explained in Chapter 2). This attitude constituted a sharp contrast to local perceptions of police and army personnel. Law enforcement officers must serve in the state they are from, but were still observed to distance themselves from their local community as “they will pretend to not even know you”. In contrast, military units cannot serve in their home state and are therefore seen as outsiders that “don’t understand the community” and “discriminate against the community members”. As a result, they were generally viewed as extraneous, extractive, predatory and/or insulated from those they were ostensibly protecting. That said, such experiences remained highly localised, contingent in part on demography and geography. At the same time, the prominence of vigilante outfits has also allowed some to allegedly embed themselves in the war economy. Numerous commentators now warn that various groups are engaging in extortion and illegal taxation, sexual extortion, drug trafficking, cattle rustling and kidnapping, thereby exploiting the conflict as both security-providers and generators of insecurity. Some in northern Nigeria have also been accused of a wide range of human rights abuses including torture, rape, forced disappearances and public executions. In Borno, interviewees tentatively referenced these links, suggesting possible connections between the CJTF and JAS, and their involvement in “evil activities against community members”, and cases of vigilantes participating in “youth gangs”. As one participant summarised, CJTF members are “respected and appreciated … [but] they are also feared due to a history of impunity”. Their alleged involvement in, or collusion with, criminal networks raised concerns among respondents that elements of the CJTF may be a “potential threat to … peace and security … in the nearest future”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-wider-systems-of-violence&quot;&gt;II. Wider Systems of Violence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, the forms of insecurity outlined in Chapter I are primarily based on community perceptions across three specific federal states. While efforts have been made to triangulate and contextualise claims where possible, they remain susceptible to the same biases and imperfections characterising all anecdotal data and do not necessarily reflect experiences across Nigeria as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, these threats do not always share the same mechanics or basic logic. For instance, several experts have criticised the presumption that “criminality and jihadism naturally converge simply because both are ‘bad’”. Narratives alluding to a linear transition from one to the other – for example, that criminals are “graduating to terrorism” – similarly neglect the iterative processes defining radicalisation and recruitment, and the variation in “pathways” between discrete forms of violent behaviour. As Christopher Hockey and Michael Jones argue, the normalisation and use of violence is not always synonymous with “accepting an extremist moral system”. Conflating different illicit activities likewise assumes actors “[see] the risks associated [with joining a gang or VE fraternity] to be little different; and … equally viable logistically”. At the same time, Lauren Van Metre has described the impact of so-called “negative resilience” on whether these entities occupy the same spaces. Referencing specific neighbourhoods or “mafia-towns” in Kenya, she outlines how municipal bosses with a “monopoly on violence … viciously protect their turf”, boxing out competitors from an otherwise favourable operating environment. Barnett and others draw similar conclusions in relation to tracts of Nigeria’s northwest: “criminals can be a stubborn lot who do not necessarily turn to jihadism simply because they are Muslim and dislike their government”. Referring to rural militancy, Promise Ejiofor agrees: “there is … insufficient data to [suggest] … bandit groups intend to impose Islam on the local communities they attack. If anything, bandits [cohabit] – and sometimes collaborate – with [extremists] but both groups are, stricto sensu, not the same”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, cross-pollination is evident in certain contexts. Interviewees described youths leveraging Boko Haram as “cover” for their own activities: appropriating its branding to extort protection payments, fleece residents and facilitate cross-border smuggling. Speaking in Yobe, one elder noted: “during the [conflict], criminals started killing non-Muslim shopkeepers and stealing their goods … they would pose as [JAS or ISWAP] to exploit people because it made them more fearful”. Others reportedly arranged kidnappings to avoid satisfying debts or to resolve personal grudges by either denouncing their enemies as terrorists to the authorities, or as informants to the insurgents. Elsewhere, street outfits like Ecomog were allegedly folded into Boko Haram wholesale, including political thugs previously used to help Borno’s elite “strong-arm elections”. As Walker explains: “these men … had not been known for their Islamist dogma so much as their cultish beliefs … [but] the attraction of being able to loot and rob with impunity under the banner of Jihad … was obvious”. Alternatively, gangs in Maiduguri and smaller frontier towns have also partnered with extremists when expedient, regardless of “ideological conviction”, leaving the rank-and-file membership of such networks somewhat porous. This transactional logic cuts both ways, as militants sub-contracted violence to provincial proxies – providing “bicycles, money, computers, and weaponry” – as a means of projecting power or infiltrating government-held areas. Emphasising the nuance of local insecurity, a NGO worker summarised:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Attacks happen under the name of Boko Haram but are actually [conducted] by criminal groups who essentially hire themselves out … for a particular [task]. It makes Boko Haram seem bigger … even if they’re miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the discursive and operational convergence, studies also identify analogies between the dynamics and demographics of crime and terrorism, especially in peripheral communities afflicted by hardship, a lack of security or basic services, a reliance on collective solidarity, and a proliferation of firearms. While recruits joining African jihadi movements are often described as uneducated and poor, this profile routinely characterises militancy of any kind. Theoretical assessments corroborate these conclusions, with Noémie Bouhana’s S5 framework suggesting the “crime–terror nexus” should really be considered a “crime–crime nexus”, given extremism and criminality are usually conditioned by similar social ecologies. The “public health model” advocated by Jonathan Challgren and others likewise finds parallels between meso-level variables (including economic deprivation and marginalisation), motivating VE alongside other social ills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explaining the background to the locally defined insecurities outlined in Chapter I therefore requires an understanding of the broader systems that may feed and facilitate them. Although qualitatively distinct, terrorism, criminality, banditry and extra-legal abuses can be seen as different (sometimes overlapping) symptoms of the same wicked problem. They coexist in an arena conducive to violent mobilisation, one shaped by what Bouhana calls “socialising affordances”, such as the normalisation of violence, societal fragmentation, and a lack of legitimate or effective law enforcement. These dynamics inform the “settings” where people socialise and act, framing the moral norms, rules of conduct and governing mechanisms that influence how ideas and discourse are received and internalised, such as whether polarisation and conflict are perceived as acceptable or deplorable. They are not deterministic in isolation – violent behaviour is also contingent on personal susceptibility and group selection, among many other factors – but they offer a permissive environment which is amenable to such responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Nigeria, the cumulative impact of colonial mismanagement and decades of neo-patrimonial governance have encouraged a diffusion of violence: with competing authority structures, an often exclusionary or inegalitarian social contract, and a widespread “culture of impunity” all contributing to cycles of instability. While the scope, intensity and resonance of these variables fluctuates over time, interviewee data implies that they continue to facilitate different forms of insecurity at a local level, as do the social responses to associated gaps in government reach, capacity and legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows is not an analysis of specific drivers, which goes far beyond the scope of this report. Instead, the following sections examine the key cross-cutting mechanisms and wider environment that enable the insecurities outlined by interviewees in Chapter I, given their important implications for practitioners and policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;politicised-violence-and-institutionalised-criminality&quot;&gt;Politicised Violence and Institutionalised Criminality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The types of insecurity outlined above – gangsterism, banditry, terrorism and military brutality – are arguably products of a shared system-level problem, based in part on the formation and defining logic of Nigeria’s political economy. Colonial legacies and the agency of elites have both conflated identity politics with access, or perceived access, to public goods, as well as, at times of stress, reframed the state as a resource in itself. This has fed into an informalisation of governmental functions, a diffusion (and privatisation) of violence, horizontal inequalities and the prominence of criminality as a mode of political competition. The result is an environment conducive to various forms of illicit, often predatory, behaviour. Tracking the implications of these dynamics, and the normative conditions they foster, can therefore offer useful insights into how different insecurities are reproduced and instrumentalised at different levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, interviewees considered graft ubiquitous, “starting at the very top” and “eating deep into society, affecting every institution” and emerging as a symptom, propellant and inherent feature of “bad governance”. Reflecting a consensus among respondents, one union worker summarised: “[It] is not hidden; 90% of our leaders are [crooked] and that is why nothing seems to be working … poverty [is] everywhere because of corruption”. State authority, resources and access all appear commoditised, with participants casting employment, investment and police coverage as contingent on kickbacks and cronyism. Elsewhere, functionaries, NGO delegates and elders were repeatedly accused of siphoning off aid money, distributing goodies to “political affiliates” or prioritising poorly managed vanity projects. Crucially, these modalities were perceived as “systemic” – normalised to the point of almost becoming “legal” – while simultaneously hollowing out public services and local security provision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interviewee said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In hospitals, there are no drugs or equipment; in schools there are no or few teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another also remarked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Diverted funds meant for provision of modern weapons [and] allowances for military personnel are embezzled by high- ranking officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a third opined:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Corruption … erodes rule of law and creates [a] sense of impunity. It means money just disappears, the resources to respond aren’t there and security services aren’t effective. Security officials, the judiciary and politicians are profiteering for themselves and are complicit … [They will] share intelligence, ignore evidence, [and] let people go for a small fine. Corruption … means criminals aren’t prosecuted, so people are just released. There is little incentive to be honest, because you won’t achieve anything, and corruption creates the suffering and anger that makes people prone to violence or criminality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claims of government malpractice and “structural rot” echo those made in the wider literature, which catalogue a surfeit of clientelism, incompetence and inefficiency. Walker, for instance, cites disparities between “apparent” and “real” education spending, with school budgets sapped by fraud, favouritism and bureaucratic opacity. Others describe how kleptocracy has fostered “billionaire judges” while leaving Nigerian officialdom “under-staffed, under-funded, and demoralised”, contributing in part towards the country’s fall from 149 to 154 (out of 180) in Transparency International’s 2021 Corruption Perceptions Index. As Ebenezer Obadare argues, “rarely does anything get done without money changing hands. The greater the value of the service being sought, the higher the fee”. Although complaints about graft are often a “dominant discourse … in the post-colonial world” and remain a “national pastime” in Nigeria itself, it is telling how far these dynamics seemingly condition everyday “encounters, experiences, and [interpretations] of the state”, and have effectively become its very “fabric”. Crucially, every iteration of insecurity outlined above has exploited, or benefited from, analogous themes (to some degree). Boko Haram preachers regularly present their insurgency as a “radical alternative” to decadent elites in Maiduguri and Abuja; expectations of bribery are baked into the corporate culture of numerous security agencies; and bandit groups paint their activities as a form of “economic emancipation”, drawing on the frustrations of Fulani herders, or the despondency of subaltern youths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these issues enjoy a long history, with profligacy and patrimonialism having been ingrained (deliberately and incidentally) into Nigeria’s institutional anatomy from the beginning. With power understood in increasingly zero-sum terms, it is vital for policymakers and practitioners to appreciate how the country’s political economy frames, legitimises, reproduces and mainstreams such dynamics in persistent but destabilising ways. They are ultimately a product of structural arrangements working and malfunctioning at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems of corruption can be traced back to the hyper-extractive “estate states” characterising British colonialism since the early 1900s. By co-opting (or inventing) local political frameworks as a conduit for “Indirect Rule”, these modes of “imperialism on the cheap” depended on the personal tutelage of newly appointed “district heads”, which placed a “premium on … controlling sub-ordinate officials” through patronage. In the north, such mechanisms effectively became an “amalgam of continuity and change understood through the idiom of tradition”, whereby tax infrastructure from the Sokoto Caliphate was layered with various forms of Weberian bureaucracy. The imposition of a formal (and parsimonious) salary system, for instance, led to poorly paid functionaries unable to fulfil the social obligations of their role as babba mutum or “big men”, incentivising “embezzlement and extortion” as they sought to satisfy the expectations of their clients. As a result, Steven Pierce argues that this graft was not necessarily novel – the pre-colonial notion of zalunci or “oppression” drew clear connotations between prestation and “possessors of office”, meaning that emirships and their subsidiaries received goods as “tangible symbols of political position”. But the introduction of external reforms did alter the logic, scope, incentives and modalities for carrying it out, encouraging or openly facilitating the “appropriation of public platforms for private ends”. At the same time, British authorities exported, and deliberately politicised, the “charge” of corruption, selectively (and performatively) prosecuting those they “wanted to depose for other reasons”. A corollary was the creation of a “moral economy” in which “changing administrative structures both enabled material malpractices and determined the ways in which those malpractices were conceptualised and, to some extent, dealt with”. They were not a “pathological deformation” of colonialism so much as its “natural consequence”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same regime also indelibly blended ideas of identity, power and property, reshaping the perceived boundaries of ethno-regional “homelands” and militarising intercommunal relations as a convenient, cost-effective method for preserving imperial authority. Some may consider Nigeria to be a paradox: a colonial confection explicitly created as a “business enterprise”, merging discrete polities (such as the Hausa, Yoruba, Delta City, and Jukun states, the Kanem-Borno empire, and Igboland) together while legislatively balkanising their demography. Policies like the “Land and Native Rights Ordinance” not only limited internal migration between (the majority Muslim) north and the (incrementally Christianising) south, but compounded educational and economic imbalances across different regions, most obviously in relation to the disproportionate investment funnelled to the port city of Lagos. Uneven, spatially determined processes of Westernisation; urban segregation via sabon gari (“stranger” or non-Muslim quarters); inflexible tenure systems; stacked police departments; tribal codification and the privileging of specific groups; and the later creation of a “tripartite federal structure” (divided between north, south and west) all fed into violent social competition. As Attahiru Jega attests, British occupiers encouraged polarisation along several lines as a means of curbing embryonic strains of nationalism, accentuating the “Muslim versus Christian, northerner versus southerner, and Hausa-Fulani versus Yoruba versus Igbo syndrome” evident today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exploitation of corruption (as “near mandatory for Nigerian officials”), local “bossism”, cultural (and institutional) pluralism, and sectional rivalries have all therefore contributed to what A H M Kirk-Greene calls a “burdensome inheritance”, with post-colonial governments recycling much the same political circuitry. In the absence of sustainable party structures or distinct ideological positions, for instance, stakeholders in Nigeria’s First Republic often resorted to ethnic sentiments and overlapping networks of clientelism as a way of building social capital and mobilising support. This does not imply such identities were innate so much as they offered an expedient vehicle for extracting largesse, effectively reducing public office to an “eatery” regulated by kinship and social affiliation. The conflation of individual and collective interests not only drove conflict between different regions, as ethno-elites allocated state contracts, jobs and development money to their “own”, but also internalised patterns of discrimination within regions, as minorities or “settlers” were either neglected or actively disenfranchised by dominant “indigene” populations. While different federal formulations (both military and civic) attempted to defuse these pressures by imposing greater consistency on the distribution of national resources (accounting for 80% of most state budgets), they also “played the unintentional role of reinforcing fundamental inequalities of citizenship”, given the majoritarian mechanics that routinely determined how goods and political power were shared at the local level. Rather than tempering inter-group friction, this reliance on state-creation and subdivision effectively merged “formal institutions … with the informal ethnic patronage networks that [many] Nigerians still trust to provide them with their best chance at upward mobility”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although temporarily eclipsed by the pan-national rubric of the early 1970s, perceptions of government as an “arena of exploitation” have endured over time, ramping up with the oil boom, and later austerity measures tied to structural adjustment programming (SAP). Even the “hyper-presidentialism” of successive military regimes – featuring a top-heavy executive (nominally) able to suppress political competition – proved inflammatory, as exemplified by General Ibrahim Babangida’s coup-proofing efforts between 1985 and 1993. Offsetting the impact of SAP reforms (characterised by a hike in living costs and unemployment), and buying the loyalty of army officers, involved manufacturing new “states” (and majority groups) to dispense gubernatorial positions and petrodollars: “supercharging divisions of ethnicity, religion and regionalism” as different communities fought for their cut. By adopting consociational policies as a “short- and midterm survival strategy”, Nigeria’s “militaricians” not only “infected” federal and local governance with a predatory logic – turning institutions “to the business of [self] enrichment” – but underlined the existential value of “indigene rights” in the popular imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These legacies, and the accompanying reliance on cash and coercion they engender, continue to shape structural violence across northern Nigeria, exacerbated in part by the democratisation processes instigated since the late 1990s. With polling considered a “winner-takes-all” contest by elites and laypeople alike, profligacy and so-called “stomach infrastructure” – the satisfaction of immediate needs – have encouraged abuses and illicit behaviour (vote-rigging, intimidation, extrajudicial killings and the renting out of local gangs) to preserve (or overthrow) existing systems of “patrimonialism, prebendalism, and patronage”. Crucially, much of this electoral violence “occurs in parallel to major and long-standing armed conflicts and … large-scale communal [hostilities]”, not least because “collective memories of discrimination and grievance” enable politicians to stoke social tensions when the outcomes look unfavourable. Borno offers an instructive example. Following the accession of President Olusegun Obasanjo, a Yoruba from the southwest, in 1999, northern powerbrokers increasingly tapped into demagoguery and identity politics as a means of securing and retaining office. This included wedge issues like “full Sharia”, an expansion of religious penal codes that “many in the Muslim community [saw] … as a panacea for the complex and messy problems of social injustice, poverty [and] unemployment”. Introduced across 12 northern states in 2000 and 2001, these reforms were a partial response to greater demands for regional self-assertion, pressure from grassroots ideologues, and antipathy towards “secular” federalism. However, they also allowed a new crop of elites to exploit expressions of piety, populism, and sectional solidarity, with aspiring candidates outbidding incumbent governors by superficially maximising the remit of Islamic law. Violence and intimidation consequently assumed theological inflections, as studies document (controversial) allegations that politicians “cultivated a symbiotic relationship with Yusuf, in which Boko Haram would deliver votes through endorsement, persuasion, or force, in exchange for influencing the terms and implementation of sharia”. While these alleged linkages have been repeatedly denied by prominent officials, and, if true, quickly collapsed, the accusations allude to a wider reliance on social polarisation as a way of accessing and maintaining power, precipitating cycles of grievance and conflict that have gradually assumed a momentum of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise, long-running processes of state formation continue to permit and facilitate local experiences of insecurity, in part because they produce government bodies prone to weakness and rapacity. Institutional pathologies, widespread impunity, and manipulation by political strongmen have not only sapped the army of munitions, food and equipment (as outlined in Chapter I) but have also consistently undermined the capacity of federal law enforcement (despite liberal injections of donor funding to help to improve the National Police Force’s accountability, efficiency and corporate culture). While day-to-day extortion may be as much about bureaucracy (offsetting the budget deficits of local stations and meeting quotas for promotions) as it is about individual profiteering, the end result – a normalisation of graft and subsequent loss of public trust – is the same, leaving many interviewees to criticise the state as ineffective or partisan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the “rules of the game” conditioning Nigeria’s political economy rely on informal modes of patronage, exclusivity and social fragmentation that seem inherently destabilising. Competition over resource access, for instance, has arguably legitimised what Maggie Fick labels a “thug democracy”, where coercion, sleaze, bribery and “everyday” graft may not only be tolerated but actively demanded by constituents keen to preserve their slice of the “national cake”, reflecting a social morality that “trumps … notions of civic duty tied to the state or national polity”. As Daniel Jordan Smith explains, “obligations to kin … are rooted in a moral economy that privileges reciprocity, sharing, and interdependence”, effectively legitimising specific types of corruption or hankali (“good sense”) in government operations. In this context, change is not just contingent on buy-in from those “Big-Men” and “Godfathers” benefiting from the status-quo, but ordinary Nigerians reliant on “patron-client … and other identitarian relationships”, with many left “compelled, enticed, trapped and resigned to participate” in the country’s “corruption complex”. As one respondent conceded, “[we] are ourselves part of the bribery/extortion machine … making contributions and payments to survive … but also … for our [own] convenience”. When these informal distribution networks function, they are liable to become centrifugal over time, marginalising minority groups and those on the outside, and thereby driving resentment, polarisation and violence. When they fail – either due to greed, negligence or a lack of liquidity – the inability of both official and clientelistic arrangements to appease local needs cedes space for radical alternatives. In short, the cumulative systems now defining the Nigerian state appear increasingly entropic: incentivising, licensing and reproducing different forms of predatory practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;social-responses-and-self-reliance&quot;&gt;Social Responses and Self-Reliance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be stressed these insecurities are not just enabled by high-level machinations or top-down prebendal politics. They also exist in an environment shaped by autonomous societal forces, particularly driven by those at the margins responding to deficiencies in government coverage and capacity. A longstanding reliance on alternative providers of protection, opportunity or empowerment – and on informal economies to sustain local livelihoods – has encouraged the proliferation of new authority structures. These eclectic methods of political organisation and self-help not only speak to an ecology marked by violence, but tend to operate outside of, or in contravention to, the state. As a result, they are liable to generate negative feedback loops that might quickly become self-reinforcing: heightening vulnerabilities, creating new grievances and opening further vectors of instability. An exposition of these factors can therefore help to better understand and contextualise the perceptions of insecurity outlined in Chapter I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, chronic mismanagement and political fragmentation have exacerbated inequalities within and between regions (see Table 2), leading to disaffection and rural immiseration. Graft continues to undermine the quality of healthcare, infrastructure, and the efficacy of poverty reduction schemes. LGAs – the most proximate tier of government for many Nigerians – have “all but ceased to function”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Inequalities Between Regions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, Kate Meagher summarises:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Northern cities have been turned into tinderboxes where hordes of young men … face the daily indignities of economic desperation and police harassment in their struggle to get by. And every day, [they] are confronted by the lavish consumption styles of a stupendously wealthy and corrupt political elite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across Kaduna, interviewees acknowledged the role of these long-running grievances in the current banditry crisis, with criminal syndicates capitalising on herder “struggles for recognition” and youth “idleness and lack of ways to make money”. These conflicts are effectively a “symptom of … broader contradictions in … a postcolonial state that exploits the masses and appears incapable of protecting its citizens, of curtailing corruption and abuses, and of providing public goods to marginal mobile groups”. As a result, Ejiofor argues that “pastoralists” illiteracy, lack of education, and inability to graze [their livestock] not only contributed to their abjection but also predisposed them to armed violence in order to eke out an existence’. Brandon Kendhammer similarly suggests that other cases of sectarian strife are “steeped in the language of marginalisation and exclusion”, with studies casting Boko Haram as “the misguided cry of a disgruntled youth, crushed by the socio-economic system on the one hand and then repressed by the state on the other”. To this end, respondents referenced neglect and poor governance – amid a wider context of poverty, illiteracy and joblessness – as crucial in enabling JAS and ISWAP to gain traction by recycling a “makeshift religious [vocabulary] that [is] both anti-state and anti-elite”. Young people with no livelihoods or prospects were offered cash, status and a “way out”, while recruiters exploited heavy-handed security crackdowns as confirmation of discrimination against Nigeria’s Muslim population, weaponising local grievances and re-packaging the insurgency as a palatable alternative to authorities in Abuja. Crucially, this framing is not unique to Boko Haram but reflects the value of theology as a vernacular for resistance, protest and social change. Contemporary terrorism shares a long genealogy with past expressions of revolutionary activism across northern Nigeria, from “purifying movements” like Uthman dan Fodio’s jihad (1804–08), to post-colonial millenarianism, and the anti-Sufi firebrands of the 1960s and 1970s. Encompassing a wide spectrum of doctrine and praxis, this heterodoxy signals a “fragmentation of sacred authority”, with dissident sects drawing on popular frustrations to contest the legitimacy of societal conventions and power structures. Although JAS has gradually shifted from Salafi polemics to a more “stripped down, propagandistic style of jihadism”, and remains ideologically distinct from previous forms of religious militancy, it is arguably the latest iteration of a violent counterculture that has reshaped, acculturated and/or challenged local politics for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these grievances also tend to be cyclical and self-reinforcing, with chronic state failings driving insecurity, which can entrench underemployment and undereducation and thereby expose communities to additional instability and conflict. The kidnapping of schoolchildren, for example, has led to 600 school closures, and Boko Haram has reportedly killed over 2,000 teachers – further restricting service provision in the already disadvantaged north. Similarly, cattle rustling destroys livelihoods directly (through the theft of herds and violence towards those who confront the culprits), and indirectly (by co-opting licit markets and therefore undermining business for those legally living off cattle). The loss of livestock and farmers’ vulnerability to coercion, as recounted by several respondents, has also led to the abandonment of arable land, thereby “crippling food production capacities” and worsening food insecurity across northern Nigeria. Many of those displaced by the violence – around 3.3 million people across northeast, northwest and north-central – chose to relocate to urban areas, which has contributed to demographic changes that bring IDPs into conflict with host communities. This was highlighted by interviewees who felt that IDPs are worsening issues like food insecurity, rising prices and jobs shortages. As a consequence, economic pressure is concentrated on those who remain, intensified by mass displacements that put additional demand on limited resources. Across the three states, this has become a cycle of violence and deprivation, with vulnerability increasing the risk of recruitment to extremist or criminal groups, and, in turn, driving further conflict. The result is a self- sustaining ecosystem of instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other informal social responses and coping mechanisms are evident as residents have tried to mitigate local insecurities in the absence of effective government coverage. Interviews offered a glimpse into the forms this can take. One participant from Borno, for instance, highlighted how tricycle keke riders “contribute money weekly so that they can come to each other’s defence and support one another in times of need … which creates a sense of economic security and belonging”, while displaced youths “formed groups and organised … to protect themselves and obtain [the] means of survival”. In neither case was it clear if these strategies included criminality or violence. Meanwhile in Yobe, community leaders have tried to “interact with at-risk youths and provide services to them” as well as working to “promote stability through mediation and conflict resolution”. Local stakeholders have also attempted to negotiate with bandit and violent extremist groups, although such interactions often elicited a backlash, either due to their unpopularity “among the civilian population” or their condemnation by security personnel. That said, this appeared somewhat contingent on sequencing. While pre-emptive negotiations were considered illicit, post-hoc engagement (usually mediation efforts following an attack or kidnapping incident) could be implicitly encouraged by officials themselves in recognition of the government’s inability to intervene, leaving the acceptability of grassroots bargaining confused and highly circumstantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prominence of vigilantism outlined in Chapter I provides another example, fitting into a long-running pattern of self-reliance and security management parallel to, and occasionally in conflict with, state authority. Community “defence forces” are not new – studies document numerous pre-colonial incarnations across Hausaland, including the Yan Banga (Community Protectors), Yan Baka (Hunters) and Dogarai (Palace Guards) – but the scale, capability and power of these groups have ramped up in reaction to both Boko Haram and the later profusion of banditry and organised crime. While interviewees emphasised the ability of militiamen to collaborate with official security services, many also warned that they had, in certain contexts, the propensity to usurp government bodies rendered “powerless” by “incompetence, [poor] resourceing, and rampant corruption”. Crucially, respondents claimed police and military coverage may actually be contracting as the state effectively outsourced day-to-day operations to the Kaduna State Vigilante Service, hunter groups, community police and several other outfits aggregated under the generic label “vigilante”. Nevertheless, the lack of clarity over their role and remit has raised concerns, with frustrations over the “voluntary” nature and sparse renumeration of these positions accentuating problems with accountability and discipline. Some, such as the Borno Youth Empowerment Scheme, continue to be equipped, paid and overseen by governing boards, and others like the “Neighbourhood Watch” receive monthly stipends, but most are not eligible for any support, training or wage. As a result, regulations are often “feeble” or only exist on paper, especially for those out in the rural periphery, compounding both a “sense of impunity” and a need for cash. Interviewees in each location described local contributions of money, food or other resources, casting these inputs as an expression of communal buy-in. Although originally organic and somewhat ad hoc, collection methods have become increasingly organised over time, as noted by participants in Kaduna and Yobe. The first claimed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have a committee that goes round to collect the cash and issues out receipts for the payment. The payment was a total of 3,000.00 Naira per person per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The head of every household contributes to this payment no matter their gender. This is collected by the community leader and paid to the local vigilante office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many stressed that such donations are made willingly – corroborating recent survey evidence of public support for vigilante activities – stakeholders also referenced the impact of peer pressure and social expectations. Numerous reports similarly cite shakedowns, tolling, intimidation and extortion of surrounding constituents, prompting several regions to ban voluntary mobilisation entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This speaks to a broader set of tensions and contradictions characterising Nigeria’s ever-more congested security arena, where local militia groups not only tend to enjoy a privileged position among their host community but fill a gap in security provision left by federal agencies. At the same time, they exist in a liminal grey zone, simultaneously empowered and disenfranchised by the state, valued and feared by nearby residents, while collaborating with and replacing official security services. The details of these dynamics, and the dispositions of the vigilantes themselves, are highly localised, complicating top-down efforts to formalise, standardise and monitor their various functions. Nor does there appear to be a plausible framework (or political appetite) for their demobilisation. By 2016, the government had only absorbed about 500 CJTF members into the army, with another tranche “employed as firemen and vehicle inspectors” and a “sizable chunk … sent to farm with modern agricultural equipment”. Such programmes do not necessarily have the scope or financial clout to satisfy paramilitary demands for compensation and recognition, encouraging gunmen to compete with traditional powerbrokers and public institutions for “political capital and authority”, and further undermine the state’s legitimacy. As former Borno governor and current Vice President Kashim Shettmia warned: “we have created a Frankenstein’s monster”, one liable to produce new cycles of insecurity, violence and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities have also come to depend on survival economies that blur the cognitive and symbolic boundaries between licit and illicit activity, adopting fluid and sometimes incongruous ways of understanding the insecurity-generating behaviour of others (and themselves). While accounts of local complicity and cooperation with Boko Haram seemed cross-cutting in terms of scope and form – usually involving banal transactions and logistical support (from food deliveries and carpentry to vehicle repairs, transit and surveillance) – their motivation and legitimacy were more contested. For instance, interviewees highlighted that residents who offered material backing were generally not seen as terrorist sympathisers, if it was done in the course of the normal business and did not involve violence: as a respondent explained, “[complicity is] based on the damage to the community, but we usually differentiate between people who committed violence and those who provided support”. Some ascribed collaboration to improvised coping mechanisms, given the lack of formal (or effective) security provision: “people are forced [into making concessions]. They feel abandoned by the government; they have no opportunities … it is the only option for them”; “government [stakeholders are] trying their best, but they sometimes leave people at the mercy of the insurgents”. Accordingly, one participant claimed that “most people who did this were arrested as terrorist supporters … [but] we in the community didn’t necessarily view it that way”. Others suggested a more mercurial logic: “[ISWAP] has their networks … there is always someone willing to do what they need, so long as the money is right”; “they’d sell to anyone … they turn a blind eye to whom the customer is, if it might benefit them” – but often delineated between urban and rural settings. Those colluding in the “bush”, for instance, were branded “dangerous, hypocritical, or conniving”, in contrast to Maiduguri’s vendors who earned a “legitimate income” from the same activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These discrepancies could, in certain cases, be part of a process of moral disengagement, enabling people to partake in illicit activities without acknowledging their own criminality. Experts described how stakeholders may only participate in specific stages of the kidnap for ransom supply chain, for instance, engaging solely in abduction, transportation, storage, negotiation, payment or “return” as a means of deconstructing their culpability. This reflects Albert Bandura’s argument that individuals can rationalise or justify harmful behaviours through the “cognitive restructuring of inhumane conduct into a benign or worthy one by moral justification … displacement of responsibility … [or] minimising the injurious effects one’s actions”. In doing so, local people can justify their behaviours in such a way that evades their collusion in the insecurity that impacts their communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the parameters between licit and illicit could also be a product of wider social inequities conditioning the public imagination, which often display ethnic or gendered inflections. For example, suppliers associated with ISWAP or JAS were typically considered “normal people”, whereas the “cooks and cleaners” catering for them in the bush were “infected with the jihadist gene”, irrespective of whether they “joined voluntarily or had been coerced”. The nuances applied to one category – differentiating between local retailers cooperating out of necessity, and the profligacy of “big tradesmen” collaborating out of greed – lapsed into blanket coverage for others. This was a pattern later evident in the ostracisation of female returnees and their children. The predominantly “Kanuri” makeup of Boko Haram’s early membership – and anecdotal evidence of “non-Kanuris” being preferred for suicide missions – has likewise encouraged what Claude Mbowou calls “interpretative shortcuts”, with efforts to reframe the insurrection as a “tribal insurgency”. Much like the conflation between Fulanis and banditry, entire populations have become suspect, with Kanuri commuters routinely selected for military spot-checks and interrogation. In reality, the group’s social base has always been “trans-communal”, integrating fighters without a consistent “demographic profile”. Accordingly, Michael Baca (among others) argues that Boko Haram’s complexion should be understood as a symptom of geography – given the Kanuri are a majority in the area surrounding Maiduguri – rather than some sort of “mechanical solidarity”; the presumption of which masks a complex sociological process of recruitment that disrupts or “ruptures” established social hierarchies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these perceptions and popular understandings of legitimate and illegitimate behaviour are undoubtedly shaped, at least partially, by political, security, religious and media elites, as shown by the outcomes of Operation Safe Corridor. By imposing an overly broad inclusion criteria, the scheme tended to absorb “civilians who [had] fled areas controlled by Boko Haram” and “mistakenly categorise [them as] jihadists”, which transformed programme “graduates” from “normal people” (or those coexisting and interacting with extremists out of necessity), to “terrorists” and local outcasts. As one interviewee in Borno noted, once individuals had gone through Operation Safe Corridor, “society [had] a different perception of them, and it actually stigmatised them even more”. However, this shift also speaks to broader power dynamics, prejudices and societal polarisation, creating an audience that is not only receptive to discriminatory discourses, but in some cases is ready to externalise blame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, the formation and dispensation of Nigeria’s political economy has profound implications for the moral context and norms framing community perceptions and experiences. The cumulative impact of state informalisation, elite-induced identity conflict, patronage politics, and the profusion of pseudo-and non-state actors may have not only fostered a “culture of impunity” but also damaged public belief in government as a legitimate arbiter of moral authority. Evidently, this resonance is not consistent across time and place, and local conflicts are “unique” in terms of the specific “combination of forces that [fuel] them”. Nevertheless, they all manifest in environments conducive to predatory behaviour, partially facilitated by government failure and the various societal responses to those deficiencies, whether induced by survival, resistance or profit. As a result, terrorism, gangsterism, banditry and military brutality may arguably be symptomatic of the same systemic problem, even if they have their own drivers and dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions-and-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusions and Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this report has highlighted, northern Nigeria faces a range of overlapping, multifaceted and cyclical crises, facilitated in part by systemic corruption, institutionalised criminality and a bottom-up dependence on various coping mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s responses were seen by many as slow, heavily militarised and marred by the involvement of security actors in graft and human rights abuses. State-level amnesty and disarmament initiatives seem to lack coordination and federal and local buy-in, while successive development efforts in the northeast are constrained by funding shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International approaches have similarly been criticised for their securitisation, claims echoed by a participant who warned: “the focus from the outside is on terrorism but that’s just one thing happening”. The importation of foreign templates, assumptions and norms was repeatedly cast as evidence of acute information deficits among national elites and external donors, with interviewees describing an “over-reliance” on theory, “arm-chair analysis” and generic reportage from Abuja. Perhaps tellingly, respondents rarely made any specific reference to interventions but stressed widespread cultural insensitivities and the peripherality of local CSOs in transnational humanitarian networks. While these narratives do not necessarily capture the full breadth of aid and security coverage, they imply exogenous projects may have limited reach, even across those regions receiving a relatively high proportion of resourcing (for example, the “BAY states” of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, this report has sought to illuminate local understandings of these crises, and the wider mechanisms that sustain and facilitate violence. It also highlights the need for holistic programming that is sensitive to, and engaged with, the local community and which moves beyond the logic of militarised counterterrorism. Below, the report puts forward a range of policy implications and recommendations, informed by the practical suggestions from local interviewees and then by the analysis of the authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;local-recommendations&quot;&gt;Local Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prescriptions from respondents were not homogenous, and many were too broad to be immediately actionable for policymakers. For example, participants cited broad solutions such as “addressing corruption [should be] the number one priority” or “equal opportunities [should be extended to] all irrespective of tribe ethnicity and religion”. Nonetheless, the more practical of these measures highlights the willingness of local people to be involved in, and take responsibility for, catalysing change from grassroots (despite the scale and complexity of the insecurity threats that they face).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spaces for dialogue and collaboration between civilians, state actors and security personnel may help to improve local confidence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Interviewees wanted community members to be empowered “for active participation in addressing issues and challenges facing the community” in order to “foster a sense of ownership and responsibility”. They suggested that avenues to improve “military–civilian relations”, or “peace and security committees in every community” would help to reduce tensions and keep residents informed about new policies and emerging risks, while increasing transparency. Respondents also advised that the inclusion of local stakeholders in decision-making may help to reduce vulnerability to bandit groups and other forms of insecurity by rebuilding a sense of community, eroding the distrust that has developed because of crime and violence, and strengthening neighbourhood resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community members should be engaged in anti-corruption efforts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Interviewees acknowledged that “corruption is for everybody to control and reduce, as it is becoming institutionalised across society”, arguing that the public tends to “provide an enabling environment”. They suggested education and sensitisation campaigns across communities, starting at a young age. Respondents also called for top-down reforms such as improved transparency, protection for whistleblowers and harsher punishment for graft among political elites and security personnel, but they wanted this to supplement bottom-up efforts to ensure a holistic, and potentially more effective, approach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wider-recommendations&quot;&gt;Wider Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These more practical recommendations are often hindered by Nigeria’s broader context, with local-level insecurities existing within, and facilitated by, a wider permissive arena. The cumulative impact of neo-patrimonialism and societal responses to an unequal, predatory and inefficient political economy has diminished trust vertically (in formal governance and state actors), and horizontally (within and between communities), especially among those on Nigeria’s geographic and socioeconomic fringes. Across the focal states, these dynamics have enabled the diffusion and normalisation of violence, strengthened a culture of corruption and impunity, driven a dependency on alternative forms of security and self-preservation and eroded the social compact. The resultant insecurity ecosystem has important consequences for those seeking to identify plausible pathways for change and attendant intervention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such approaches must also consider two specific challenges facing foreign engagement in northern Nigeria. First, as outlined above, interviewees described how international donors have to contend with local and national scepticism of external interventions, which stems from historic and contemporary understandings of donor programming as exploitative, harmful and discriminatory. Second, they must navigate a precarious and at times antagonistic relationship with the federal state. This may manifest as the active obstruction of donor efforts, such as the Nigerian government’s 2018 suspension of the activities of UNICEF and various NGOs (amid accusations that they were failing to provide humanitarian services and supporting the insurgency). Additionally, donors are perhaps more likely to face tacit barriers, including various “no go policy areas”. Nevertheless, this report offers reflections to help to inform policy and programming. These overlapping takeaways and recommendations are indicative of the need for both the Nigerian government and relevant donors to avoid siloed programming in favour of an interconnected and mutually reinforcing approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Porous boundaries between licit and illicit economies complicate programming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The adoption and shedding of interchangeable identities to suit individual priorities creates an ecosystem of individuals willing to engage in insecurity-generating behaviour, complicating the landscape for donors looking to implement development and peacebuilding programmes. A focus on behaviours rather than national-legal, group-level definitions of terrorism and crime may help donors to avoid overlooking the key actors who are generating insecurity. However, the blurred lines between licit and illicit activities, and the ways in which people have navigated this for their own benefit in the context of violence and extreme economic hardship, should be considered. Doing so may help to avoid antagonising local communities, and assist donors in ensuring their programming is sensitive and responsive to local understandings and survival strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust deficits must be overcome to facilitate meaningful community engagement with, and ownership of, donor programming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Given widespread corruption and insecurity, many local communities appear to have lost trust in the Nigerian government and its various affiliates and agencies – while also remaining suspicious of international donors – thereby disincentivising public engagement with top-down initiatives. Simultaneously, residents are wary of undertaking community-led peacebuilding initiatives, in case the government labels them as terrorist or bandit sympathisers. Meanwhile, conflict-driven fragmentation has resulted in distrust within communities. The social isolation and exclusion this engenders can limit the effectiveness of poverty- reduction efforts and can exacerbate instability – factors to which donor interventions should consider and respond. Community-led social activities have helped to erode distrust and fragmentation in other contexts of protracted conflict, and there are prior examples of programming focusing on social cohesion in Nigeria. Donors looking to replicate these will need to consider how they can be scaled, while remaining considerate of local nuance and sensitivities. Similarly, this challenge highlights the need for community engagement with, and ownership of, any donor programming focused on security sector reform. This is to ensure community buy-in and regain the trust of local people in state security services and external interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The disconnect between local and national/international understandings of insecurity in northern Nigeria needs to be addressed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Interviewees expressed concern that donors and the Nigerian state are often detached from realities on the ground in northern Nigeria. While some programming is built on extensive evidence, poorly informed responses risk neglecting local experiences, thereby reinforcing the disconnect between Abuja and Nigeria’s peripheries and overlooking the informal structures of governance and legitimacy on which people in many northern communities rely. This has ramifications in terms of programming, leading to the “othering of north-east Nigeria” and the propagation of Western-centric and imperialistic counterinsurgency narratives which justify a reductive preoccupation with, and acontextual application of, counterterrorism interventions and nationalised approaches to regional issues.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This exacerbates the frustrations of local people who continually see donors and the Nigerian state as failing “to look beyond terrorism” and as “addressing surface-level issues without addressing underlying causes” which “leads to temporary improvements but not long-term stability”. Moving beyond tokenistic attempts at localisation to ensure genuine community engagement with, and ownership of, security and peacebuilding initiatives is necessary. Donors and the Nigerian state must acknowledge that local people’s experiences and perspectives can meaningfully inform culturally sensitive programming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interventions should be integrated and cross-cutting, ensuring different lines of effort are mutually reinforcing and commensurate with the system-level problems they are tackling.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The bounded typology of policymakers often results in piecemeal, parochial and short-lived efforts to address insecurity, as strategies and programmes fixate on specific issues without appreciating the wider ecology that enables, shapes and perpetuates them. To take one example, VE is typically the product of a broader conflict ecosystem, intersecting with and becoming transformed by other forms of insecurity and violent mobilisation. As Thurston argues, “organisations like Boko Haram – even if they are in dialogue with global trends – develop localised doctrines that evolve through interactions with their surroundings”. Simply put, jihadism conditions, and is conditioned by, the context it occupies. Any effective response must therefore be holistic and cross-cutting to account for this permissive environment. Strategic communication or deradicalisation programmes, for instance, may not necessarily be suitable “for a context in which most militants are not motivated by religious ideas”, while conventional disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration efforts risk overlooking differences between inter-communal drivers across the northwest and insurgent-state dialectics in the northeast. Of course, there are still practical and conceptual difficulties to actually integrating prevent and counter violent extremism (P/CVE) within wider intervention efforts, from development and governance to stabilisation and peacebuilding. Understanding how these competing logics can be reconciled at a programmatic and policy level is therefore essential if P/CVE (and counterterrorism) is to remain a relevant resource for delivering real security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress is hampered by minimal political appetite for reform.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The limited appetite for structural change among Nigeria’s political and economic elites has sometimes led to the imposition of anti-corruption laws, initiatives and technical “fixes” without a concerted effort to address the normalisation of graft across the private and public spheres. The nature of this corruption has also eroded the judiciary, thereby creating an “entrenched culture of impunity and [a] flagrant disregard for the rule of law”, which further limits Nigeria’s ability to tackle criminality and creates a vicious circle for donors to navigate. External stakeholders are unlikely to be able to instil a “big bang” reform to break this self-reinforcing cycle of corruption, given the lack of domestic buy-in. Continued support for “sustained, cumulative incremental reforms” may yield more long-term success, along with the identification and provision of support to political, institutional and civic islands of integrity both locally and nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity and national security have become inseparably intertwined in recent years. Once regarded as a global commons—an open and interconnected frontier—cyberspace has rapidly been reframed both as the fifth domain of warfare (the other four being land, sea, air, and outer space) and as the front line of great power competition. In addition, cyberspace has proven to be far more centralized than many initially believed. It is a space where just eight providers generate 65 percent of all internet traffic. A triadic competition—specifically, the contest among democracies, authoritarian states, and big tech companies—constantly arranges (and rearranges) cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2025, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba visited Washington, D.C., and held a summit meeting with President Trump. On that occasion, the two leaders issued a joint statement, declaring that they “intend to expand bilateral security cooperation in cyberspace by leveraging new technologies such as artificial intelligence and secure and resilient cloud services to deepen information-sharing.” The statement positioned cyber as a core pillar of the U.S.-Japan alliance and signaled a willingness to jointly confront emerging digital threats through shared technological and operational capacities. Just as the U.S.-Japan security alliance remains an indispensable mechanism for regional stability, the joint statement clearly reflects both countries’ recognition that enhanced bilateral cyber cooperation is essential for ensuring order and stability in an increasingly unstable cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This white paper examines how Japan and the United States should pursue bilateral cooperation in cyberspace within the framework of the current U.S.-Japan alliance, which remains one of the most robust security partnerships in the world. To that end, the paper outlines Japan’s current cybersecurity threat landscape and key legislative developments. It also identifies three core policy recommendations for strengthening Japan’s cyber resilience that can ultimately contribute to the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japans-threat-landscape&quot;&gt;Japan’s Threat Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost daily, Chinese and North Korean threat actors target Japan through a range of cyberattacks. Chinese threat actors systematically conduct near-continuous cyber espionage against Japanese targets, focusing in particular on achieving political and military advantages. Major sectors under attack include shipbuilding, aerospace, manufacturing, and government research. For instance, in January 2025, Japan’s National Police Agency (NPA) reported that the Chinese MirrorFace group carried out cyberattack campaigns against sectors covering semiconductors, telecommunication providers, manufacturing, aerospace technology, and academia, among others. Moreover, investigators have noted that Chinese hacking waves against Japanese targets tend to mirror Beijing’s working hours—including pausing on Beijing’s national holidays—indicating state sponsorship. U.S. and Japanese officials have also warned of Chinese firmware implants in the routers and telecommunication equipment used to maintain long-term access to government and corporate networks. China’s cyber operators represent a near-constant espionage threat to both Japan’s strategic industries and to its government. Finally, Chinese cyberattacks are highly sophisticated and often target sensitive information related to national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea, in contrast, remains financially motivated, focusing its efforts on stealing cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, from Japanese cryptocurrency exchanges. For example, the Lazarus Group has carried out several major cryptocurrency heists against Japanese targets. To cite one attack, in December 2024, Japan’s NPA and U.S. agencies jointly disclosed that Lazarus-linked hackers—tracked as “TraderTraitor”—stole 4,502.9 bitcoin ($307 million USD) from a Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange the prior May, explicitly identifying TraderTraitor as part of the Lazarus Group. Japanese authorities have issued multiple advisories warning domestic cryptocurrency exchanges about North Korean phishing campaigns, which typically involve LinkedIn/social media lures or fake recruiters in efforts to trick exchange employees into executing malware on their work computers. Experts note that cyber theft of various cryptocurrencies is a preferred revenue stream for North Korea, as, in general, cryptocurrency is managed more loosely than fiat currencies. Although North Korean actors also engage in ransomware and intellectual property theft, to date, their most visible activities in Japan have been aimed at draining cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japans-preparedness&quot;&gt;Japan’s Preparedness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Japan’s significant economic stature—it is the world’s fourth-largest economy by GDP—its cybersecurity posture is widely perceived as increasingly lagging behind its peers. For example, the Harvard Belfer Center’s National Cyber Power Index (NCPI) ranked Japan ninth in 2020, dropping it to sixteenth in 2022. Similarly, the International Institute for Strategic Studies’ (IISS) Cyber Power and Future Conflict report categorized Japan as a Tier 3 cyber power, placing it alongside North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason for Japan’s relatively low evaluations is that its domestic debates and policy efforts are not being effectively communicated to international audiences. In fact, in some cases, international reports appear to rely on outdated information or even miss Japanese-language sources entirely. This is a failure of strategic messaging on Japan’s part. Moreover, although analysts praise Japan’s international contributions to the United Nations, the G7, and the G20; its domestic cyber-governance, including prosecution of criminal cyber activity; and its steady capacity-building program for the ASEAN countries, the country’s offensive cyber capabilities are seen as lacking. The NCPI and IISS reports both point to Japan’s limited cyber-counterstrike capabilities as a major weakness. Both reports incorporate evaluations of offensive cyber capabilities and, in some cases, the “intent” to use such capabilities as part of their evaluation criteria. According to these international analyses, Japan clearly lacks offensive cyber capabilities, and this negatively affects its international standing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these assessments may be subject to debate, the reasons behind Japan’s lower rankings are clear: Both reports emphasize Japan’s limited capability to conduct offensive cyber operations, particularly within the Japan Self-Defense Forces. This is not a new issue. The absence of robust counterstrike capabilities has long been recognized as a critical gap in Japan’s national security posture. In an attempt to address this gap, Japan’s second National Security Strategy (published December 2022) explicitly stated: “In order to ensure secure and stable use of cyberspace, especially the security of the nation and critical infrastructures, the response capabilities in the field of cybersecurity should be strengthened equal to or surpassing the level of leading Western countries.” To achieve this goal, Japan has begun enacting and implementing legislative reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;legislative-shift-japans-active-cyber-defense-bill&quot;&gt;Legislative Shift: Japan’s Active Cyber Defense Bill&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s constitution and legal framework have traditionally constrained offensive cyber measures. Article 9 of the country’s constitution renounces war and prohibits Japan from maintaining traditional military forces, which has long been understood to mean that Japan can only take defensive—and not offensive—actions. Furthermore, critics have pointed out that preemptive actions might violate both Japan’s Telecommunications Business Law and its Act on the Prohibition of Unauthorized Computer Access. In practice, this has meant that Japan could detect and defend against cyberattacks but had no clear legal mandate to infiltrate adversary networks or neutralize threats before they materialized. In fact, until very recently, Japan’s approach to cyber threats was essentially reactive: focusing on hardening networks and coordinating with allies, rather than on “hacking back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, however, Japan’s cyber policy has shifted toward limited “active defense.” The Ishiba administration (building on earlier proposals led by Ishiba’s predecessor, Fumio Kishida) has introduced a so-called Active Cyber Defense Bill, complete with amendments to several key laws, including the Self-Defense Forces Law, the Basic Act on Cybersecurity, and the Police Duties Execution Law. The proposed legislation passed the Diet in May 2025, and is scheduled to come into effect no later than November 2027. If enacted as planned, the legislation would bring about several major changes in Japan’s approach to cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the bill and amendments to existing laws will expand the authority of the National Police Agency and the Self-Defense Forces, empowering them to conduct active cyber measures. As such actions must be carried out in a coordinated manner between the two agencies, a newly established organization within the Cabinet Secretariat will lead the coordination, working closely with the National Security Secretariat (NSS) as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Japan will implement a cyber-traffic monitoring mechanism. The government and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) both will be permitted to analyze cross-border data traffic traversing Japan’s cyber infrastructure. Public concern over protecting the confidentiality of communications, as guaranteed by Japan’s constitution, remains strong in Japan. During deliberations in the House of Representatives, strong reservations were voiced—particularly by opposition parties—regarding potential infringements on privacy. As a result, the bill was amended to explicitly state that the confidentiality of communications—as guaranteed under Article 21—shall not be unduly restricted, keeping any domestic cyber communications off-limits. A new independent oversight body will supervise and authorize these activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the bill will strengthen public-private partnerships and establish a new central cybersecurity authority, replacing the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) housed in the Cabinet Office. This marks a substantial institutional shift: The Cybersecurity Strategic Headquarters will be restructured; the prime minister will serve as its chair; and all cabinet ministers will be included as members. The “Cabinet Cybersecurity Officer”—a new position holding vice-ministerial rank—will be created within the Cabinet Secretariat to oversee cybersecurity-related affairs. While not mandatory, the law also provides the legal basis for appointing a Minister of State for Cyber Affairs within the Cabinet Office. The new organization will act as the quarterback for Japan’s cybersecurity by leading government efforts and advancing cyber capabilities in coordination with the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among security and cybersecurity experts in Japan, there are concerns—particularly regarding communications monitoring—that the law’s scope might be too limited to detect threats effectively. It is true that the bill does not provide a complete solution to the goals set out in Japan’s 2022 National Security Strategy. The new law and accompanying amendments should be seen as an initial step toward the longer-term strengthening of Japan’s cybersecurity capabilities, not the ultimate answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-policy-priorities-for-the-us-japan-alliance&quot;&gt;Three Policy Priorities for the U.S.-Japan Alliance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-Japan cooperation in cyberspace has made steady progress over the past decade, evolving from initial information-sharing frameworks to more integrated efforts in defense planning and multilateral norm-building. As explained previously, Japan’s Active Cyber Defense Bill marks a turning point for the country: It is expected to further strengthen operational coordination between Japan’s Self-Defense Forces and the U.S. military, particularly in responding to state-sponsored cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, cybersecurity challenges cannot be fully addressed through defense cooperation alone. Given the increasing complexity and interconnectedness of digital threats, the next phase of alliance-based collaboration must extend into civilian domains, private-sector infrastructure, and multilateral norm-setting. The following section proposes three concrete areas—outside of the military sphere—where deeper U.S.-Japan cooperation can help shape a more resilient and secure cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-protecting-the-public-core-of-the-internet&quot;&gt;1. Protecting the Public Core of the Internet&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability of physical communication infrastructure, such as subsea cables, has emerged as a growing concern. This was brought to the forefront when, in late 2024, undersea cables in the Baltic Sea connecting Sweden–Lithuania and Finland–Germany were deliberately severed, raising concerns about the possibility of NATO’s Article 5 being triggered. While Article 5 states that an armed attack against one or more NATO members shall be considered an attack against them all, thus obligating collective defense, cyber and hybrid attacks fall into a legal and strategic gray zone. The increasingly visible exposure of physical infrastructure—particularly communications cables vital to military coordination and civilian life—to deliberate sabotage by threat actors has pushed NATO allies to consider whether such actions meet the threshold for a collective response. The 2024 incident in the Baltic Sea was not the exception; the world had already witnessed Russian interference with European satellite communications during the invasion into Ukraine in 2022. Subsequently, in January 2025, a cargo vessel flagged as African but actually operated by a company affiliated with individuals in China sabotaged Taiwan’s international cable. Protecting communication infrastructure is a critical economic and national security concern for the international community that merits urgent attention, not only to safeguard civilian and commercial connectivity but also to deter malign actors from exploiting physical infrastructure vulnerabilities as instruments of coercion, espionage, or hybrid warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an island nation, Japan unsurprisingly relies on subsea cables for 99 percent of its international communications. What is less widely known is that Japanese companies possess world-leading technologies in manufacturing fiber-optic cables, repeaters, and related equipment. In addition, Japanese telecom companies operate around seven cable-laying vessels—the largest such fleet in East Asia. In the face of various connectivity crises in that region, Japan is positioned to play a critical leadership role in tackling this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the physical strength of cables can be increased, or multiple cables are laid to create redundancy, it remains challenging to completely prevent cable cuts. The most effective way to avoid this type of sabotage is to raise the cost of destroying the cables beyond any benefit that would be obtained through their destruction. The threat of physical sabotage—whether in wartime or peacetime—necessitates a normative international approach to protecting what Dennis Broeders of Leiden University called the “Public Core of the Internet.” Broeders argues that protecting the core of the internet—for example, the Domain Name System (DNS), internet exchanges, and key physical infrastructure including subsea cables—is essential for maintaining the internet’s stability, security, and openness. He warns against threats such as state-sponsored cyberattacks, monopolies, and efforts to fragment the internet through national regulations. Instead, Broeders advocates for international cooperation, stronger governance, and various cybersecurity measures to ensure that the internet remains decentralized and resilient. In short, he calls for efforts to safeguard the internet’s core to preserve its global, open nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core-protection endeavor can be split into two different streams of work. First, Japan and the United States should lead efforts to develop peacetime norms prohibiting cyberattacks on this public core, including contributing to ongoing UN processes such as the Open-ended Working Group (OEWG). Second, the wisdom of international humanitarian law should guide international actions, particularly in times of armed conflict. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is currently exploring how to apply international humanitarian law (IHL) to cyberspace. One group of scholars proposed an idea called “Digital Emblem” that would serve as a machine-readable marker embedded in digital systems used by humanitarian organizations, thereby enabling military cyber operators to identify and avoid targeting these systems during armed conflict. For over 150 years, the ICRC has employed the images of a red cross or a red crescent to convey a simple message: Those who wear these symbols, or facilities and objects marked with them, must be protected from harm. The concept of a digital emblem is the same. Digital watermarks or fingerprints could be added to systems used by hospitals and humanitarian actors, indicating to others that such systems should be kept from harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-harmonizing-iot-security-accreditation-across-jurisdictions&quot;&gt;2. Harmonizing IoT Security Accreditation Across Jurisdictions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has emerged as a global leader in regulating cyberspace. Rules created in Brussels increasingly shape global standards, with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) being the most prominent example. In addition, the European Union’s Digital Services Act, which imposes new responsibilities on large online platforms, has already influenced policy debates in Japan and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another notable EU initiative is its Cyber Resilience Act, which introduces an accreditation and labeling system for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. IoT devices are always connected to the internet and often run with weak passwords or outdated firmware, making them attractive targets for hackers. Recent cyber campaigns, including China’s APT group Volt Typhoon, have exploited vulnerable IoT devices—specifically SOHO routers—to infiltrate networks while evading detection. To address this vulnerability, the use of insecure IoT products must be reduced and regulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union is taking the lead in this field. With its Cyber Resilience Act, IoT device vendors are required to implement security measures for each of their products and comply with the essential security requirements defined by the European Union—for example, by requiring clear disclosure of product-support periods and prohibiting the use of weak default passwords. When all necessary security measures have been implemented in a product, the CE mark label may be affixed to it to indicate conformity. Beginning in December 2027, IoT products without the label cannot be legally sold within the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a critical development because the efforts to regulate IoT security have already begun across multiple jurisdictions. Japan will launch its own voluntary certification system in 2025 through the JC-STAR project, managed by its Information-Technology Promotion Agency (IPA). The United States plans to introduce the Cyber Trust Mark, overseen by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The United Kingdom enacted the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act in 2022; the act took effect in April 2024 and mandates basic security standards for consumer smart devices, including banning default passwords and requiring transparency on security support periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these initiatives share the same goal—improving IoT security—their regulatory details differ. Moving forward, coordination among like-minded countries and the development of interoperable international rules and norms will be essential to securing the global digital environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-ensuring-secure-software-development-through-the-software-bill-of-materials-sbom&quot;&gt;3. Ensuring Secure Software Development Through the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software today is rarely built entirely from scratch. Instead, modern applications are each a collection of codes assembled from various sources—open-source libraries and proprietary components, to name a few. As both the scale and complexity of software development have grown exponentially, so too have the challenges of understanding and managing the software supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A striking example of this challenge emerged in late 2021, when researchers at Alibaba discovered a zero-day vulnerability, a critical software flaw unknown to the vendor at the time of discovery, in a widely used open-source library called Log4j. Until then, Log4j had been largely unknown outside the developer community. Log4j provides logging functionality, enabling software to record its own operational events. This particular library was popular because it allowed developers to easily add logging features without writing them from scratch. As a result, Log4j has been incorporated into countless products and services—including major platforms such as Cloudflare, Apple iCloud, Minecraft, Steam, Tencent QQ, and Twitter (now X).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability in Log4j had an unprecedented impact on cybersecurity worldwide. A single flaw in this obscure software component suddenly exposed countless systems and users across the globe to potential exploitation. The real crisis, however, was not the vulnerability itself but rather the uncertainty it created: Few organizations could confidently say whether or where Log4j existed within their systems. As one cybersecurity expert described it: Log4j represented “the single biggest, most critical vulnerability of the last decade.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Log4j incident provided critical momentum for developing the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) concept. Just as food packaging lists ingredients to inform consumers, software needs a similar mechanism to disclose its internal components. An SBOM provides this transparency, identifying the libraries—like Log4j—that are used within a piece of software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has taken a leading role in promoting software supply-chain security. A late-2021 executive order, for example, mandated that software suppliers to the federal government provide SBOMs, effectively making them a requirement for government procurement contracts. These developments highlight the growing recognition—at least in the United States—that software supply-chain security is not only a technical issue but also a governance and policy priority. The continued leadership of the United States in this domain will remain critical in shaping the global conversation around SBOMs and secure software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government and the country’s various industries are facing challenges in responding to SBOM requirements. In particular, medical device manufacturers and companies in the automotive sector are conducting their own assessments to adapt to evolving requirements in the U.S. market. In response to this rapidly changing cyber ecosystem, the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) published a document titled “Guidelines on the Introduction of SBOM” in July 2023, marking the beginning of efforts to create an environment that facilitates domestic companies’ compliance with digital regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s cybersecurity is at a turning point. The scale and sophistication of threats from China, North Korea, and Russia continue to evolve. The country’s Active Cyber Defense Bill represents a significant policy shift, reflecting Japan’s growing recognition of cybersecurity as a core element of national security. Yet Japan’s future efforts must extend beyond legislation and prioritize coordination with the United States and other like-minded countries. Strengthening cooperation to protect the public core of the internet, harmonizing IoT security standards, promoting secure software development, and deepening international cyber law enforcement collaboration will be essential to ensuring a resilient cyberspace—not only for Japan but for the entire international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) governance systems vary based on countries’ cultural and social attributes. Influenced by its culture and social background, Japan’s AI governance policy focuses on promoting innovation, taking an agile, “soft-law approach” to governance, and emphasizing international interoperability of AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government recently strengthened its legal efforts regarding AI by introducing legislation in the Diet (parliament) at a time of dramatically shifting debate on global AI governance policies in 2025. With the start of the second Trump administration in the United States and the AI Action Summit held in Paris in February 2025, the direction of global AI policies is shifting rapidly in favor of innovation, and Global South countries are beginning to participate in discussions about global AI policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This white paper presents the issues that Japan should address in its AI governance policies and the direction of future collaboration between Japan and the United States. The paper begins with a review of the evolution of Japan’s AI governance strategy and a summary of recent developments in Japan’s AI policy debate. It then identifies current trends in the debate on global AI governance policies and offers recommendations on the future direction of Japan’s AI governance policy and cooperation with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-overview-of-japans-ai-governance-policy&quot;&gt;An Overview of Japan’s AI Governance Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A History of Japan’s AI Policy Before Generative AI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;from-ai-technology-strategy-to-ai-strategy-2022&quot;&gt;From AI Technology Strategy to AI Strategy 2022&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, Japan has been a country with a strong orientation toward technology and industrial policy—particularly innovation policy—led by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI). This innovation focus applies in the field of AI technologies as well. Taking the global lead, Japan has already started to formulate AI strategies aimed at promoting innovation since the mid-2010s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As public interest in AI increased around 2015, the Japanese government began to implement some measures regarding AI. The first steps included developing an R&amp;amp;D (research and development) system, studying the impact of AI on Japan’s industrial structure, and promoting the concept of “Society 5.0.,” a Japanese vision of future society leveraged by new technologies. Instructed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the Japanese government announced its first AI technology strategy in March 2017. After the strategy’s execution went somewhat astray due to inconsistent government frameworks, a new advisory body was established, publishing a second AI strategy that focused on human resources and R&amp;amp;D in June 2019. Upon further review, the government issued a revised AI strategy in April 2022 that shifted the focus to the deployment of AI systems in society (Table 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structural problems within the Japanese government explain the multiple revisions of the country’s AI strategy—specifically, only the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) and METI have any expertise on AI technologies, and the expertise they do have is limited in the government. In particular, the Cabinet Office (CAO), which plays a central role in developing strategies for the entire government, relies on short-term transfers of human resources, mostly from the MIC and METI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/L6i29xD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: History of AI and Its Governance Strategy in Japan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;history-and-priorities-of-japans-ai-governance-policy&quot;&gt;History and Priorities of Japan’s AI Governance Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, Japan’s AI strategies have not emphasized ethics or governance as much as other countries. In fact, references to AI governance in Japan’s 2022 strategy are overwhelmingly low when compared to equivalent strategies of other countries announced between 2020 and 2022 (Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/D8AaVkA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Percentage of AI Governance-Related Sentences in Each AI Strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this does not mean that the Japanese government was unaware of the ongoing global debates over AI ethics and governance. Rather, the Japanese public was just not as interested in AI ethics and governance. Japan had been studying AI ethics for years. The MIC published guidelines for R&amp;amp;D and the use of AI in 2017 and in 2019, respectively; the CAO released a report on AI and human society in March 2017 and published “Social Principles of Human-Centric AI” in 2019 to address the pressing issues surrounding the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) AI Principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trends in global AI governance shifted “from principle to practice” after the release of the OECD AI Principles, and METI took the lead on AI governance in Japan. A 2021 report hinted at nonbinding guidelines from the perspective of “governance innovation.” The following January, METI released “Governance Guidelines for the implementation of the AI Principles ver. 1.1.” The 2022 governance guidelines marked the confirmation of Japan’s so-called “soft-law approach” to AI governance: promoting voluntary governance efforts by businesses through the release of nonbinding guidelines by the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ai-governance-policy-after-generative-ai&quot;&gt;AI Governance Policy After Generative AI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release of ChatGPT at the end of 2022 generated interest in Japan regarding AI risks. In May 2023, the CAO established a new AI Strategy Council, which quickly published a “Tentative Summary of AI Issues.” The summary primarily focused on addressing potential risks posed by generative AI and, with that focus, differs from Japan’s previous AI strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the 2023 summary still emphasized the importance of promoting voluntary efforts by businesses (the soft-law approach) as an immediate objective. In June 2023, the council instructed the MIC and METI to merge existing AI guidelines and to update them with generative AI in mind. The official result of these efforts was published in April 2024 as the “AI Guidelines for Business.” (These guidelines are in line with the international code of conduct formulated by the Hiroshima AI Process after the 2023 G7 summit hosted by Japan.) A revised version of the guidelines was published in March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2024, the ruling party began to consider legislation involving AI regulations, basing their proposals on trends in AI governance policies in the European Union and the United States. Details are described below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;approaches-of-japans-ai-governance-policy&quot;&gt;Approaches of Japan’s AI Governance Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cultural Background of Japan’s AI Governance System&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;two-types-of-risk-real-social-risks-and-artificial-general-intelligence-agi-risks&quot;&gt;Two Types of Risk: Real Social Risks and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) Risks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussing AI governance, it is important to distinguish what societies generally perceive as two different types of risk posed by AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first type consists of real social risks caused by the use of technology that conflicts with shared social norms, such as ensuring safety and protecting human rights. These risks are not unique to AI technology. Innovative technologies in general bring real social risks, accentuating the need for technology governance more broadly. These risks become apparent and recognized as social problems whenever new technology diffuses into society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second type of risk centers on anxiety about future AGI technology—specifically, the fear that current AI technology will develop into AGI in the future and, as a result, threaten the survival of humanity (so-called existential risk). This risk perception is specific to AI technology and emerges as technological advancement proceeds, typically at the so-called “hype” stage immediately before technology diffuses into society. Because of perceived existential risk, the need for governance can be imperative for some societies, and may result in ex ante regulations for AI development based on precautionary principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japans-perceptions-of-future-agi&quot;&gt;Japan’s Perceptions of Future AGI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a significant difference between Japanese and Western public perceptions of anxiety concerning future AGI. AI governance researchers in Japan have identified several factors to explain this, including differences in religious background and varying popular culture views on human and AI (machine) relationships (Table 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ITDts5g.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: Differences of Social Perceptions of AGI Between the West and Japan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the Japanese people are relatively more optimistic about the future social impact of AI technology than Western populations are. Thus, there is almost no discussion in Japan about introducing strong ex ante regulations across sectors from the perspective of the precautionary principle. This difference in social perception of AI risk is thought to be the reason why Japan’s AI strategies emphasize a soft-law approach as policies for AI ethics and governance. Japan’s perception of AI risk might parallel that found in China, India, and other Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;approach-1-soft-law-approaches&quot;&gt;Approach 1: Soft-Law Approaches&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Promotion of Voluntary Efforts Through Soft-Law Approaches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the characteristics of Japan’s AI governance system is that it consistently maintains the so-called soft-law approach, a policy of promoting voluntary initiatives by businesses based on nonbinding guidelines from the government, rather than introducing binding legal regulations (hard law) as an initiative applicable to all sectors related to the development and use of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for this difference is that Japan does not share the West’s anxiety about future AGI. In addition, ex ante regulation based on the precautionary principle is quite difficult to enact in the Japanese legal system, and the rigidity of laws and regulations makes agile governance difficult and strongly inhibits innovation, which, as mentioned previously, is a core focus of Japanese AI policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A soft-law approach makes agile governance possible for business, but that only applies to the reduction of unintentional risks, especially by large companies, since guidelines often do not reach small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and malicious actors will not comply with the guidelines. A soft-law approach may work in Japan because most Japanese businesses accept and comply with such norms as part of the country’s social culture of government-industry relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Balance with Regulations in Specific Fields&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In specific sectors where real social risks are already apparent due to the diffusion of AI technologies, the Japanese government does discuss introducing regulations. In the application sectors of AI technologies such as finance, autonomous driving, and medical care, where significant impacts on life and physical safety can be predicted when a system malfunction occurs, the need to review and modify existing regulations has been actively discussed and even implemented. For example, in the field of autonomous driving, legal reforms concerning safety rules made it possible for unmanned vehicles to be operated on public roads in 2020. The Digital Agency, a Japanese administrative agency established in 2021, is continuing to work with relevant ministries and agencies to update its strategies and safety rules in light of technological advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policy and legal discussions are also underway in other areas where real social risks from generative AI are apparent, especially challenges associated with copyright issues. As for the risks related to dis/misinformation by generative AI, Japan experiences this threat primarily in the wake of natural disasters and internet fraud; countermeasures to these challenges are being discussed, not from the context of AI regulations, but rather from the context of digital platforms regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;approach-2-interoperability-as-an-international-contribution&quot;&gt;Approach 2: Interoperability as an International Contribution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Japan’s Emphasis on Interoperability for Global AI Governance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another characteristic of Japanese AI governance strategy is an emphasis on international interoperability. In fact, Japan has actively worked to ensure interoperability of AI governance systems around the world, especially by using the frameworks of the G7 and OECD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has been actively involved in the formulation of OECD AI Principles since 2016, and it has played a leading role in the Hiroshima AI process since the emergence of generative AI. In addition, after the establishment of AI Safety Institutes (AISIs) in the United Kingdom and the United States at the AI Safety Summit in 2023, Japan responded swiftly, announcing its own AISI the following month. These actions suggest high interest in establishing international standards related to AI governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, the first description in the “AI risk” chapter of various AI strategy documents is about Japan’s “international contribution.” In other words, Japan’s AI governance strategy is more concerned with ensuring interoperability than with reducing domestic risks caused by AI technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Japan’s Neutral Position in Global AI Governance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s interest in interoperability reflects a recognition that it does not have the ability to set de facto standards like an AI superpower such as the United States could, nor can it promote global standardization processes like the European Union. Japan has therefore focused its efforts on interoperability, seeking not to intervene in the formation of regulations or guidelines introduced by the European Union or the United States but rather to ensure that core principles for interoperability are agreed upon internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, Japan is in a relatively advantageous position for advancing interoperability within the global AI governance system. While Japan is a part of the G7 as a major developed country, it has a relatively neutral position vis-à-vis other actors. Moreover, since Japan is the only Asian country in the G7, it could play a leading role in alleviating concerns about Western bias in developing global standards for interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recent-trends-in-japans-ai-governance-policies&quot;&gt;Recent Trends in Japan’s AI Governance Policies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Japan’s New AI Act&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Japan has long taken a soft-law approach to AI regulation, as mentioned above, discussions involving the (hard law) legal system emerged in early 2024 as regulatory considerations for advanced AI models evolved in the European Union and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2024, the AI Project Team of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) presented an outline of a bill that would impose notification and reporting requirements for businesses specifically related to advanced AI systems. However, the motivation for the proposal was not necessarily to reduce the risks caused by AI systems in Japan, but rather to not be criticized as a country with inadequate legislation when social problems arise in the world due to advanced AI systems. In other words, the LDP’s proposal can be interpreted as part of a pattern of promoting international interoperability of the legal system in the fields of advanced AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LDP recommended that the government develop the minimum necessary legal framework for AI models that pose extremely high risks while also emphasizing the importance of more general guidelines. At a meeting of the AI Strategic Council in December 2024, Prime Minister Ishiba stated that Japan will build an AI legal system that will be “a model for the world.” In February 2025, a bill known as the AI Act was approved by the Ishiba Cabinet and submitted to the Diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official name of the AI Act—the Bill on Promotion of R&amp;amp;D and Utilization of AI-related Technologies—indicates that the focus of the bill is promoting AI innovation. Moreover, the bill is a so-called “basic law” and does not include any new legal regulations or penalties, instead outlining the establishment of a new AI Strategic Headquarters within the government, the direction of the government’s basic measures, and the responsibilities of private companies and other stakeholders involved (Table 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hxoJmHp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 4: Outline of the Japanese AI Act&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for basic measures related to AI governance, this bill includes the development of guidelines in line with international norms, analysis of cases of infringement of individuals rights, consideration of countermeasures, and guidance for businesses operating AI systems. In this sense, the AI Act follows Japan’s AI governance policy to date: promoting voluntary efforts through guidelines consistent with international norms; responding to risks and reviewing ex post facto regulations within existing legal frameworks in principle; and promoting international cooperation for interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implementing-japans-ai-act&quot;&gt;Implementing Japan’s AI Act&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI Act was passed by the Diet on May 28, 2025, and came into effect on the same day. However, the government could face major issues after its promulgation, namely a lack of requisite expertise to implement the actions stipulated in the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since civil servants in the Japanese government are, in principle, employed for life, there are few officials with knowledge of AI technology, with the exception of some in the MIC and METI. In order to implement the AI Act—including measures related to AI governance—it is essential to quickly strengthen the AI-related capabilities of government organizations by recruiting new talent and training existing officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another concern is that the establishment of the new AI strategic headquarters may create new vertical divisions and fragmentation of authority within the cabinet. It will be necessary to develop an institutional framework to advance cross-sectoral strategic planning in the cabinet to promote a comprehensive digital innovation strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-recent-transformation-of-global-ai-governance&quot;&gt;The Recent Transformation of Global AI Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Shift from AI Safety and Risks to AI Opportunity and National Interest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landscape of global AI governance has transformed drastically since the beginning of 2025. Specifically, the priorities of the second Trump administration and the themes addressed at the Paris AI Action Summit in January–February 2025 suggest emphasis on AI innovation instead of AI governance, and countries around the world are now shifting their policies in favor of AI innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These shifts include promoting investment in AI (as seen in the United States, France, and the European Union) and deregulation (as seen in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the European Union). However, as each country emphasizes the promotion of its own national interests, conflicts among major developed countries are coming to the surface—in particular, tension between the United States and the European Union under the Trump administration, which were highlighted when Vice President JD Vance strongly criticized EU digital and AI regulatory policies at the Paris summit. There also seems to be a divergence between the United Kingdom and France, since the United Kingdom refused to sign the summit’s declarations. Under these circumstances, there is concern about the future capacity of the G7 to promote international cooperation on AI governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another trend in the debate on global AI governance is the increased participation of countries in the Global South. India served as a co-chair of the 2025 Paris AI Action Summit and will chair the next AI summit; its presence is expected to continue to increase in the future. China, an AI superpower, has been advancing a standardization strategy domestically, promoting a resolution on AI capacity building at the United Nations, and actively engaging developing countries in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Japan’s Coordinating Role in a Period of Transformation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although global AI policies are shifting from governance toward innovation, the former will remain important due to the potential social risks of AI. As a promoter of a soft-law approach domestically and interoperability globally, Japan’s coordinating role on the diplomatic stage will be increasingly important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If tension among G7 members continues, Japan, which is in a relatively neutral position and has been actively working on the Hiroshima AI process in recent years, can coordinate bilaterally with the United States and the European Union and encourage a consensus position on AI governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan can also play a role in strengthening relations with countries of the Global South, including India, with which it has developed strategic ties in recent years. Japan established the Friends Group of the Hiroshima AI Process in May 2024, and will continue to prioritize outreach to the Global South as China tries to enhance its own influence in the developing world. But the capacity challenges in the Japanese government noted above will have to be addressed in order to sustain Japan’s global leadership role in AI governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-japan-cooperation-on-ai-governance&quot;&gt;U.S.-Japan Cooperation on AI Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S.-Japan Collaboration on AI During the Biden Administration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-Japan collaboration on AI strategies progressed steadily during the Biden administration. The April 2024 Kishida-Biden joint statement specifically described Microsoft’s investment in Japan and cooperation in the field of AI by research institutes in both countries. AI governance strategies were discussed in the “Japan-U.S. Dialogue on the Digital Economy.” However, most of the discussions on AI governance focused on cooperation through multilateral institutions such as the G7 and the OECD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of economic security, the Japan-U.S. Economic Policy Consultative Committee (the so-called economic “2+2”) has been underway since July 2022, and the second joint statement (November 2023) includes AI as an emerging and critical technology, emphasizes G7 collaboration on AI governance, and encourages collaboration between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Japan’s Information Technology Promotion Agency (IPA) as partner AISIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S.-Japan Collaboration on AI During the Trump Administration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. relations with major developed countries, such as the members of the European Union, have become more complex since the inauguration of the second Trump administration in January 2025. However, as indicated by the February 2025 summit meeting between Prime Minister Ishiba and President Trump, the U.S.-Japan relationship seems relatively stable as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a joint statement, the two leaders indicated that they will seek to collaborate to lead the world in the development of AI and other critical technologies in order to elevate their economic partnership to the next level. To that end, they instructed the relevant ministers to strengthen U.S.-Japan economic cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of AI investment, it is noteworthy that SoftBank, Open AI, and others announced the Stargate Project in the presence of President Trump on January 21, 2025; these companies also announced a partnership on “Cristal Intelligence” on February 3, just before the bilateral summit meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The direction of AI policy under the second Trump administration is gradually becoming clear after the repeal of the Biden administration’s executive order on AI policies and the issuance of a Trump executive order for a new action plan. Despite these steps, as the debate surrounding global AI governance undergoes transformational changes, the Trump administration’s AI governance strategy remains uncertain. Given that the United States and Japan are partners that can have a significant impact on global AI governance, the first challenge will be to develop a common understanding of the current situation and then to craft a joint strategy for the future direction of AI governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI Capacity Building for the Japanese Government&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government proposed the AI Act recognizing the increased importance of AI technologies in society. Strengthening AI expertise across the government is imperative to fully execute the act’s stipulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the Japanese government should develop a plan to increase the capacity for managing AI—not just at the cabinet level, but across the entire government—by building an ecosystem that includes academia and the private sector. Japan’s coming AI Strategic Headquarters should pursue the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Formulate comprehensive AI, digital, and innovation strategies and relay instructions for execution to government ministries based on extensive and up-to-date knowledge of AI technological and industrial trends.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coordinate and publish AI governance guidelines in an agile way through a multi-stakeholder process in line with international norms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enable the entire government to respond quickly to various real social risks and take appropriate countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the government should immediately promote the use of AI in all ministries and develop an initiative to recruit and develop AI talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthening-japans-coordination-role-on-global-ai-governance&quot;&gt;Strengthening Japan’s Coordination Role on Global AI Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s leadership role on AI governance will need to expand beyond the G7 to include following initiatives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bilateral coordination with key players such as the United States and the European Union and enhanced outreach to developing countries of the Global South, such as India.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building on efforts not only in the G7 and OECD but also other institutions such as the Quad (U.S.-Japan-Australia-India cooperation mechanism) and the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sharing-a-common-understanding-of-future-global-ai-governance&quot;&gt;Sharing a Common Understanding of Future Global AI Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Japan and the United States, as partners, could have significant influence on global AI governance, they must develop a common understanding on AI governance and a shared future vision for global AI governance systems. Priorities should include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The future development of AI technology and governance in a global context.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The role of G7 initiatives in global AI governance strategy as well as the involvement of Global South countries such as India.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responding to China’s engagement of the Global South with economic security in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, ongoing collaboration between research institutes such as NIST and IPA and between businesses in both countries will form the basis for future cooperation on AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global AI governance system is currently undergoing a major transformation as the emphasis in the policy debate shifts from AI safety to innovation. The Trump administration played a major role in this transformation, but its global strategy for AI governance remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan, which has also emphasized innovation and interoperability and has taken a soft-law approach domestically via guidelines and general principles, is preparing to enact its AI Act “as a model for the world” and should be expected to play a coordinating role in the transformation of global AI governance policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under these circumstances, Japan must strengthen its government’s AI expertise, including diplomatic capabilities, to develop a common understanding with the United States about the use of AI technology to support innovation and economic growth, as well as to shape the policy debate on future visions for global AI governance.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite its growing population’s increasing demands for responsive governance, economic opportunity, and equitable treatment, many of their aspirations remain unmet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narratives around the state of democracy in Africa tend to swing between exuberant optimism and gloomy pessimism. Recent electoral outcomes across the continent, however, reveal a more nuanced reality that defies easy characterization. In what some analysts have seen as part of a global “anti-incumbent election wave,” 2024 saw opposition parties achieve remarkable victories across several African nations with relatively robust democratic institutions, suggesting a vibrant and resilient demand for democracy. For example, the Botswana Democratic Party lost its parliamentary majority after 58 years of uninterrupted rule. South Africa’s African National Congress fell below majority status for the first time since the end of apartheid in 1994, forcing it into a coalition government. Similarly, opposition victories in Senegal, Ghana, Somaliland, and Mauritius all signaled a broader trend of both electoral accountability and dissatisfaction with the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These outcomes reflect several connected factors: widespread economic discontent exacerbated by slow post-pandemic recoveries, as well as by rising global inflation related to ongoing wars in Europe and the Middle East; local perceptions of corruption and governance failures; demographic shifts, with younger voters less tied to liberation narratives and more motivated by their own diminished prospects; and—perhaps most significantly—the presence of independent judiciaries and electoral commissions, free media, and active civil societies that have helped translate public discontent into peaceful political action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the enthusiasm around these peaceful transitions is tempered by several less desirable electoral outcomes, which suggest that in places where democratic traditions have been slow to take root—such as Mozambique, Chad, and Comoros—it remains difficult to challenge embedded incumbents and overcome the capture of state institutions. For example, the deeply entrenched Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) was able to undermine what was hoped to be a competitive election, instead extending its nearly 50-year hold on power in a process marred by widespread allegations of fraud that sparked violent unrest. Similarly, violence erupted in the lead up to Chad’s presidential vote, with the leading opposition candidate being killed in a standoff with federal forces earlier in the year; President Mahamat Déby formally succeeded his deceased father as president after overseeing the ratification of a new constitution that allowed him to run while serving as the transitional head of state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With another 10 presidential contests scheduled to take place in 2025, this year is already shaping up to be significant for African politics. The first, which took place in Gabon on April 12, offers a complicated counternarrative to both the optimistic and pessimistic narratives that predominate—perhaps indicating what might lie ahead for the continent’s upcoming elections. As with Chad’s election last year, Gabon saw a junta leader take power, with General Brice Oligui Nguema securing a landslide 90.4 percent of the vote after altering the country’s transitional constitution to allow himself to run. While many Gabonese and outsiders might argue that having no candidate on the ballot with the last name “Bongo” for the first time in more than 50 years is an accomplishment worth celebrating—as is the calm atmosphere of the campaign process—it is hard to argue that Gabon’s election represents a true transition to democratic rule. While on paper the outcome has fulfilled the promise of a transition, it has perhaps more accurately consolidated military power under a democratic veneer. If anything, Gabon’s election demonstrates how seemingly democratic processes can simultaneously reinforce authoritarian tendencies, highlighting the complicated nature of political transitions in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this light, some of the most consequential African elections of 2025 will occur in countries where incumbents cling to power through constitutional manipulations and institutional capture. In others, the electoral environment is sure to be more contested. Will we see more of the kind of middle-ground “managed democracy”—hewing closely enough to democratic procedures but without the substantive conditions for genuine competition or accountability—or might true change be on the horizon? There are several African elections worth watching in late 2025 to help make this determination: Cameroon, Tanzania, Côte d’Ivoire, and Guinea. In January 2026, Uganda is set to hold presidential elections, after the country has been under the rule of President Yoweri Museveni for nearly four decades since 1986. Now 80 years old, Museveni’s continued hold on power raises growing questions about succession and the future of governance in Uganda. Meanwhile, civil society organizations, independent media outlets, and human rights defenders face an increasingly repressive environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sbq6aNl.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Map 1: State of Democratic Freedom in Africa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cameroon-inflection-point-or-more-of-the-same&quot;&gt;Cameroon: Inflection Point or More of the Same?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cameroon’s presidential election, scheduled for October 31, exemplifies the complex set of challenges facing African electoral processes this year. On the surface, the contest appears to be merely another iteration of the political status quo that has prevailed since 1982, when President Paul Biya first assumed power. Now 91, making him the world’s oldest serving head of state, Biya is standing for a disquieting eighth consecutive seven-year term; by some medical miracle, he could be 99 when his term expires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His ruling Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement (RDPC) has maintained power since it was established in 1966, having since built up total institutional control of the state. This dominance has enabled a history of fraudulent elections, including the most recent presidential vote in 2018, when opposition candidate Maurice Kamto officially received 14 percent of the votes and was subsequently arrested along with hundreds of supporters for protesting the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But two developments distinguish the 2025 electoral cycle from the past. First, Biya’s increasingly fragile health and extended absences from public view can no longer be ignored and have triggered considerable behind-the-scenes succession maneuvering within his party. While the constitution provides for President of the Senate Marcel Niat Njifenji, himself 90 years old, to assume temporary leadership and organize elections within 120 days should Biya die or step down, this process faces uncertainty given the RDPC’s historical capture and manipulation of state institutions. Indeed, one rumored scenario is that Biya could choose to hand power to his son Franck prior to elections to ensure a dynastic succession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, approximately 30 opposition parties are supporting the Political Alliance for Change, headed by long-time opposition figure Maurice Kamto. This is a significant development in the context of “Cameroon’s single-round plurality system that advantages the incumbent.” However, Biya’s government has already banned this coalition, declaring it “illegal” and a “clandestine movement.” Biya’s RDPC has further attempted to postpone legislative elections until 2026, potentially disqualifying Kamto from even running in the presidential election, given that his coalition currently holds no seats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With five months to go before the vote, the preelection environment has been marked by increasing repression. Recent months have seen arbitrary arrests of opposition members, journalists, and civil society leaders. Media outlets critical of the government have had their licenses suspended, while reporters covering corruption face violence and detention. Last October, when media speculation was rife that Biya had died after a prolonged foreign absence, the government declared it illegal to publicly speculate about the president’s health. These tactics reflect a broader crackdown on civil liberties and a closing of the political space for civil society actors. This remains especially true in Cameroon’s English-speaking regions, where a simmering conflict with the country’s Anglophone minority has resulted in thousands of deaths and massive displacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tanzania-the-velvet-glove-over-the-iron-fist-comes-off-again&quot;&gt;Tanzania: The Velvet Glove Over the Iron Fist Comes Off Again&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tanzania is gearing up for another contentious parliamentary and presidential election, also on October 31. The Party for Democracy and Progress (CHADEMA), Tanzania’s main opposition party, is barred from participating in the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections after refusing to sign an electoral code of conduct in the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections after refusing to sign an electoral code of conduct, a move the party claims is unconstitutional. Furthermore, CHADEMA party leader and presidential contender Tundu Lissu was arrested in April 2025 on treason charges after holding public rallies promoting his party’s “No Reforms, No Elections” campaign. It is unclear if CHADEMA’s disqualification is unconstitutional. Furthermore, CHADEMA party leader and presidential contender Tundu Lissu was arrested in April 2025 on treason charges after holding public rallies promoting his party’s “No Reforms, No Elections” campaign. In Dar es Salaam, prominent East African activists were detained and allegedly tortured, and others deported, in advance of a court hearing for Lissu’s treason charge. These recent attacks—as well as credible reports of electoral fraud and intimidation in the 2020 general elections and the 2024 local government elections, and a general culture of repression by Tanzania’s ruling CCM—suggest that President Samia Suluhu Hassan is willing to use intimidation and force to win reelection this October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCM, having ruled Tanzania since the mainland’s independence in 1961, is currently the longest-serving ruling party in Africa. It has operated in lockstep with the country’s police and intelligence services for decades to clamp down on opposition by detaining, arbitrarily arresting, and disappearing political figures and dissidents. In addition, demonstrations are met with disproportionate violence. On the eve of the 2020 elections, for example, security forces shot at protesters in Zanzibar, killing at least 10 citizens and wounding 50. As one anonymous CCM senior leader described the symbiotic relationship between the party and security forces, “A withdrawal of support by the security agencies would mark the end of CCM’s reign. . . . CCM has traditionally avoided criticizing the security agencies even at closed-door meetings, giving them a free hand to do whatever they wished without the fear for accountability in the name of helping CCM win elections.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samia Suluhu Hassan, the former vice president, was swept into office in 2021 following the death of President John Pombe Magufuli. Her presidency was initially met with hope of democratic reform after her controversial predecessor had spent his tenure peeling back political freedoms, clamping down on opposition parties, and repressing dissidents. But even after his death—rumored to be by Covid-19, the very existence of which he denied—Magufuli’s legacy remains popular in parts of Tanzania for his no-nonsense, austere approach to governance and his emphasis on improving the country’s physical infrastructure. Ultimately, his oppressive rule made clear what has always been evident: The Tanzanian constitution is weak, and presidential power easily supersedes the law. Opposition figure Tundu Lissu framed it aptly: “What Magufuli did is he removed the velvet glove from the iron fist that has always been the Tanzanian state.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in her presidency, Hassan reversed an unconstitutional ban on all political rallies, eased media censorship, and began reconciliatory talks with opposition parties. She touted these political reforms as her “4Rs” philosophy: reconciliation, resilience, reform, and rebuilding. Seizing on the death of Magufuli and the reconciliatory signals from President Hassan, opposition figures revived a 30-year push for constitutional and electoral reforms. The logic behind opening this space is simple: Maintaining the illusion of participatory democracy is important for the CCM to be seen as a legitimate party that has been chosen resoundingly, time and again, to lead the country since the introduction of multiparty elections in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international community also picked up on President Hassan’s reconciliatory tone and raised hopes that she could usher in a different, more democratic leadership for Tanzania. For example, it was one of three countries that former Vice President Kamala Harris visited in her 2023 Africa tour, a rare high-level visit from the Biden administration. Speaking from Dar es Salaam, Harris described President Suluhu as a “champion in terms of democratic reforms” in Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this openness to reforms did not last long. A chain of arrests, abductions, and intimidation of opposition candidates in the run-up to the 2024 local elections—in which officials claimed the CCM won 99 percent of all seats—marked a return to the party’s violent and heavy-handed rule. Ahead of the upcoming elections this October, the CHADEMA party in Tanzania is campaigning under a “No Reforms, No Elections” agenda, calling for a voting boycott unless the government implements electoral reforms, including establishing an independent electoral commission, hiring nonpartisan election staff, and ensuring there is no interference from Tanzania’s security forces in the electoral process. For making these demands, CHADEMA was banned from participating in this year’s election on a procedural basis, and its leader, Tundu Lissu, was arrested on treason charges—which are punishable by death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of a court hearing for Tundu Lissu in late May, the government detained prominent Kenyan lawyers and activists at Dar es Salaam’s airport and promptly deported them. Activists, including Martha Karua (Kenya’s former Justice Minister), Willy Mutunga (Kenya’s chief justice and president of the Supreme Court), Hanifa Farsafi (prominent Gen Z activist), and others, were visiting Dar es Salaam to show support for Tundu Lissu. In an unprecedented escalation, two other prominent East African activists, Boniface Mwangi and Agather Atuhaire, were reportedly arrested, brutally tortured, and abandoned days later on the Kenyan and Ugandan border, respectively. Atuhaire and Mwangi described alleged rape while in detention. While the detention, torture, and disappearance of Tanzanian activists is sadly a frequent occurrence, the alleged abuse of these foreign activists by the Tanzanian government is a new and dangerous escalation by CCM to suppress dissent in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hassan and the CCM do not appear interested in yielding any of the power and control they have accumulated over six decades. Barring the highly unexpected, the CCM appears likely to win these parliamentary elections resoundingly, with Hassan also winning her presidential race by a comfortable margin. The same anonymous senior CCM official described their party’s approach succinctly: “The priority at the moment is to win regardless of the cost.” In doing so, the party will continue the trends seen in Mozambique and Comoros: entrenched political parties using violence and intimidation to cling to power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;côte-divoire-balancing-democracy-and-stability&quot;&gt;Côte d’Ivoire: Balancing Democracy and Stability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Côte d’Ivoire’s current political stability has been maintained through its steady economic growth and development rather than President Alassane Ouattara’s commitment to democracy. Since 2017, the country’s democratic institutions have weakened, with diminished vertical and horizontal accountability because neither parliament nor the judiciary holds much influence, and the political arena showcases limited opposition participation. In the lead up to the presidential election on October 25, tensions are rising as politicians and their supporters face the reality that this process will test the foundations of their democracy. If Ouattara chooses to run for a fourth term, it could endanger Côte d’Ivoire’s strides in economic growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 15 years Ouattara has been at the helm, the country has had “one of the fastest-growing economies globally, with an average growth rate of 8 [percent] between 2012 and 2019.” Côte d’Ivoire is also the second-largest economy in West Africa after Nigeria. This makes its stability critical for the region, especially given the recent fracturing of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the ongoing terrorist insurgencies in the Sahel. Sharing borders with Mali and Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire remains vulnerable to insurgent groups who might seize upon the internal instability triggered by a controversial or contested election process to gain a foothold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of multiparty elections in Côte d’Ivoire in 1990, the country has never experienced a peaceful transfer of power. Current tensions over the presidential election are fueled by memories of past electoral crises, which led to two consecutive civil wars from 2002–2007 and again from 2010–2011. While both conflicts began under previous governments before President Ouattara’s first term, the collective trauma of thousands of civilians losing their lives in political violence and collectively more than a million Ivorians being displaced from their homes provokes a visceral response ahead of elections today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voters understand that the integrity of Côte d’Ivoire’s elections depends on the strength of its democratic institutions—yet the current government has already shown troubling signs of undermining them. When Ouattara announced that he intended to run for a third term in 2020, civil society actors reported harassment, arrests, and restrictions on freedom of assembly. Additionally, concerns were widespread regarding the role of Côte d’Ivoire’s Constitutional Court and Independent Electoral Commission, with the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights finding the latter lacked impartiality and independence ahead of the 2020 elections. In June 2024, Ouattara issued a presidential decree that further restricts freedom of association. Ahead of this year’s election, opposition parties have threatened to withdraw representatives from the Independent Electoral Commission, citing a lack of transparency and a bias toward the ruling party, the Rally of Houphouëtists for Democracy and Peace (RHDP). RHDP has expressed its support for a fourth Ouattara term, and Ouattara has hinted at his intention to run again, saying, “I am in good health and eager to serve my country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The openness and fairness of Côte d’Ivoire’s election and the sanctity of the electoral space are currently under threat. Multiple candidates have been excluded from participating, including leading opposition candidate Tidjane Thiam, due to his now-renounced French citizenship. (Disqualifying candidates because of dual citizenship is a tactic that was previously used in 1995 and 2000 to bar Ouattara from contesting due to his father’s Burkinabe citizenship. ) As a result, Thiam stepped down from the presidency of the Democratic Party of Côte d’Ivoire—although his party reelected him to the position a few days later. Other key opposition figures who have been barred from running in the upcoming election are Charles Blé Goudé, Guillaume Soro, and former president Laurent Gbagbo due to their criminal convictions in court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RHDP has not yet named a potential successor to President Ouattara, stating that the decision to step down rests with him. If Ouattara decides to run again, international reactions will be illustrative. First, because ECOWAS strongly condemned recent coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, it is now in an awkward position of having to steadfastly uphold its commitment to democracy in all member states—including holding Côte d’Ivoire to the same standard. Second, Ouattara’s close relationship with French President Emmanuel Macron raises questions about whether Paris will publicly support him, especially as it is facing waning influence in Africa and sees Ouattara as one of its few remaining reliable allies. Given Côte d’Ivoire’s strategic importance in fighting extremism and as a regional economic power, the question remains how much political malfeasance the international community will accept in the name of overall stability. Outtara’s answer to this question could well be the deciding factor in his decision whether to seek a fourth term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guinea-does-the-military-plan-to-stay-in-power&quot;&gt;Guinea: Does the Military Plan to Stay in Power?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guinean military deposed President Alpha Condé in September 2021 and installed then-Colonel Mamady Doumbouya as the country’s new leader. The military leaders dissolved the civilian government and suspended the constitution, promising to organize elections by December 2024. This three-year timeline resulted from consultations between the military leaders, ECOWAS, and the African Union. As part of the agreement, ECOWAS agreed to lift the sanctions it had imposed on Guinea when the military took over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an opposition leader for many years, Alpha Condé had fought for democracy and stood up against the various dictatorial regimes that ruled Guinea. He won the 2010 presidential election and became the first democratically elected president in the country’s history. Five years later, he was reelected for his second allowed term under the constitution. But in 2020, he organized a constitutional referendum that reset the presidential term limits, which (among other changes) enabled him to run for a third time. The population voiced their discontent through massive protests leading up to the referendum and through the presidential election. While these protests were widely ignored, the post-electoral violence and civil unrest that followed fueled growing tensions between the population and the state, setting the stage for the military coup in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three years in power, Guinean military leaders have postponed the promised 2024 elections until further notice with little public communication. They have pointed to logistical and other challenges, such as the lack of adequate road infrastructure and communication systems, as the main reasons, even though neither of these impediments is a new development. Still, since 2022, the military government has engaged in popular consultations about a new constitution and spoken with different segments of society, including former officials, political parties, and the Guinean diaspora. In his New Year’s address to the nation, Doumbouya said he was committed to restoring constitutional order and announced that his government would organize a constitutional referendum in 2025, to be followed by general elections, but did not set a date. The lack of an electoral timetable or transparency has fueled uneasiness among Guineans, who have serious doubts about Doumbouya’s commitment to a democratic transition. Five months after Doumbouya’s speech, the government did announce that the constitutional referendum would be held on September 21, 2025. But there is still no exact date announced for the much-awaited legislative and presidential elections slated for December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several signs indicate that Doumbouya and his associates in the military plan to tighten their grip on state institutions. They have gradually consolidated power by delaying the timetable and not respecting the budgetary constraints agreed upon with ECOWAS, favoring military appointees over civilian officials, cracking down on opposition groups and protests, suppressing the media, and arbitrarily detaining critics. For example, the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralization started an evaluation and audit of 211 political parties in June 2024; four months later, it dissolved 53 parties, placing another 67 “under observation” and suspending 54 for three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rally of the Guinean People (RPG) and the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea (UFDG), two major opposition parties, are under observation but are permitted to operate for the moment. Former president and RPG leader Alpha Condé is in exile, as is former prime minister and UFDG leader Cellou Dalein Diallo. Their return remains uncertain. Condé, who had been under house arrest, was granted temporary medical leave with the understanding that he would return to Guinea after receiving care. He would likely be reassigned to house arrest should he come back and run for president. The same fate might await Diallo. As of this writing, no opposition leader still in the country has emerged as a serious potential challenger to Doumbouya at the polls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doumbouya had been officially referred to as the “president of the transition” in official communications following his investiture in October 2021. Since 2023, this is no longer the case, signaling a sense of permanence in the position. He also promoted himself to general in January 2024. Meanwhile, he has been building political support through coalitions and alliances with senior leaders who have defected or been co-opted from Condé’s RPG and Diallo’s UFDG. Furthermore, he has been credited with reducing ethnic tensions by surrounding himself with representatives of different regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guinean military leaders’ approach to power is anchored in the country’s long history of authoritarian rule. This includes the 25-year dictatorship of Ahmed Sékou Touré and the 24-year military-backed regime of General Lansana Conté. These repressive regimes nevertheless fostered a resilient civil society and a strong public commitment to democracy, leading to Guinea’s first multiparty elections in 2010, which brought longtime opposition leader Alpha Condé to power. Time will tell whether Doumbouya will persevere in consolidating military power or steer the country back toward civilian democratic rule. Either way, he will face a civil society that remains active, continuing to hold protests despite several bans. These stakeholders can be his allies or adversaries, depending on whether he organizes credible elections in 2025 or manipulates the process to cement military rule. Breaking the cycle of authoritarianism and transitioning back to democratic governance will be critical for Guinea’s national stability, economic growth, and regional security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-implications-beyond-the-binary&quot;&gt;Policy Implications: Beyond the Binary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africa’s democratic trajectory has been marked by both progress and setbacks over the past few decades. Indeed, the trends remain troubling, with only 7 percent of Africans living in what Freedom House terms “free” societies, a figure that has been in steady decline over the past 20 years. But rather than viewing African democracy through a binary lens of progress or decline, policymakers should recognize these varied trajectories as part of a complex continuum requiring tailored approaches to institutional development, economic governance, and civil society engagement. The contrasting electoral developments of 2024—and likely 2025—present several considerations for policymakers and democracy advocates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, democratic outcomes depend heavily on institutional foundations: Independent judiciaries, electoral bodies, and media enable genuine transitions, while their absence facilitates the illusion of democracy. In Africa’s upcoming elections, the weakness and capture of state institutions in those countries holding votes is perhaps the greatest hindrance to future free and fair elections, but also the most difficult indicator to change in terms of labor, money, and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, economic and governance failures remain primary drivers of political change, whether channeled through democratic institutions, social movements, or military interventions. Here, too, many of the African countries with presidential elections this year have demonstrated governance failings, as well as growing public dissatisfaction over these failings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, civil society and youth activism represent critical vectors for democratic pressure. Youth-led movements are challenging entrenched leadership, while diaspora communities amplify calls for accountability. Digital technologies offer both enhanced transparency and new avenues for electoral manipulation. Amid the waning presence of international electoral observers, civil society groups have become more sophisticated at conducting their own election monitoring. But as capable as these groups have become, they also require institutional channels to translate discontent into sustainable reform. Given the influence that a robust civil society can have on the conduct and outcome of elections, many governments in Africa are making concerted efforts to close the civic space open to potential watchdogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africa’s upcoming year of elections already signals a moment of great promise and potential peril for a continent that has yet to fully meet the aspirations of its growing populations, who increasingly demand responsive governance, economic opportunity, and equitable treatment. How voters express their beliefs and demands through these election cycles could well determine the future trajectories of these nations and their respective regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is to our knowledge the first published review of human rights abuses inside North Korea associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regime shut down its international borders and restricted internal travel from January 2020 until August 2023 – halting all exchanges related to trade, tourism, diplomacy, and humanitarian aid – and introduced a set of “anti-epidemic” rules that included strict internal quarantine measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the outside world had scant means to assess how everyday North Koreans fared during the three-and-a-half-year lockdown. The only information available came from the government, which declared during the first two years of the pandemic that the country had no positive cases of COVID-19 and touted its anti-epidemic efforts as “a shining success” of its socialist system. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) later publicly acknowledged a COVID-19 outbreak for the first time in May 2022, reporting minimal deaths (74) and declaring “victory” over the virus only three months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is based on the voices of 100 ordinary DPRK residents amplified through micro-surveys conducted in the second half of 2023, just as the country’s lockdown restrictions and border controls were lifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our report documents five major observations from these citizens about the government’s culpability and negligence in managing the pandemic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The North Korean government disseminated disinformation to its own citizens and to the world about the pandemic. Contrary to its statements to the World Health Organization (WHO) of “zero cases,” the pandemic raged in the country for more than two years before the regime admitted in May 2022 that the virus had permeated its borders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe that if the government had spoken truthfully about the pandemic and accepted outside help from 2020, many deaths could have been avoided. Survey respondents all noted increased access to COVID-19 testing and vaccines after May 2022 when Pyongyang admitted to cases of COVID-19 and reportedly accepted some assistance from China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to the regime’s long-delayed announcement of an outbreak in May 2022, citizens reported having virtually no access to vaccines, no antiviral medications, and minimal supply of personal protective equipment. Moreover, lockdowns of markets and restrictions on internal movements exacerbated food and medicine shortages. It’s likely the national government dealt with the pandemic crisis by shirking responsibility and compelling the populace to fend for themselves. The government’s negligence was nothing short of abominable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The regime’s response to the pandemic also prevented individuals and officials at the local level from reporting symptomatic cases due to fear of censure and lockdown. This, in turn, intensified suffering as the pandemic spread.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Efforts by the regime to use nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI), defined as “anti-epidemic measures” (e.g., forced lockdowns, travel restrictions, market shutdowns), to strengthen authoritarian control over the citizenry simultaneously unearthed new sources of public resistance and potential regime vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report’s observations, based on a sample of 100 responses, should not be interpreted as a complete representation of views in North Korea. But they still provide the first glimpse into the experiences of ordinary North Koreans during the country’s most extreme period of isolation arguably in its history. Our observations are further informed by the North Korean regime’s well-documented track record of systemic human rights abuses and oppressive governance, as detailed by sources like Freedom House’s annual Freedom in the World Report, the U.S. State Department’s annual report on human rights practices, and the 2014 United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the DPRK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;For governments and international organizations seeking to improve the welfare of North Koreans, these observations about the pandemic lockdown can guide policies on a range of issues:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not trust official DPRK statements or data at face value. Verify everything.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if the North Korean government is likely to reject it, continue to offer humanitarian aid when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devise and support legislative and nongovernmental organization initiatives to increase North Koreans’ access to accurate outside information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. and allied governments working to prepare for potential DPRK regime collapse scenarios need to keep in mind that periods of increased authoritarian control can generate new, less visible sources of regime vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue to document evidence of human rights abuses to support future prosecutions of North Korean leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generating a clear understanding of conditions inside the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) has always been a challenge. For decades, the so-called Hermit Kingdom has strictly limited movements of people, goods, and information across its borders, earning the moniker “the hardest of hard targets” among U.S. intelligence analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the North Korean regime’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic brought the country’s opacity to new levels. The regime shut down its international borders from January 2020 until August 2023 – halting exchanges related to trade, tourism, diplomacy, and humanitarian aid – and introduced a set of “anti-epidemic” rules that included strict internal quarantine measures. (Reports indicate that Pyongyang did accept limited Chinese support in 2022.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the outside world had little means to understand and assess how everyday North Koreans fared during the COVID-19 lockdown. The only information available came from the government, which declared during the first two years of the pandemic that the country had no positive cases of COVID-19 and hailed its anti-epidemic efforts as “a shining success” of its socialist system. The DPRK later publicly acknowledged a COVID-19 outbreak for the first time in May 2022, reporting minimal deaths (74) and declaring “victory” over the virus only three months later. This unusual transparency may suggest that the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, particularly in Pyongyang, made containment impossible, prompting the leadership to acknowledge cases to reassure the public and demonstrate control over the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such pronouncements by the DPRK would normally be regarded as disingenuous and meaningless. However, the COVID-19 information vacuum has potentially greater significance for the world than the typical DPRK obfuscations. The global health community lacks a clear grasp of the degree to which COVID-19 spread within North Korea and whether it might be a breeding ground for new variants given the already dire lack of health care, poor nutrition, rampant disease (e.g., tuberculosis), and weak vaccine infrastructure. In addition, human rights advocates lack a clear sense of how much Pyongyang used the pandemic to justify new forms and levels of oppression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in cooperation with the George W. Bush Institute, is to our knowledge the first published review of what happened inside North Korea during the global pandemic. It is based on the voices of 100 ordinary DPRK residents amplified through microsurveys conducted in the second half of 2023, just as the country’s lockdown restrictions and border controls were lifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-the-questionnaires-were-conducted&quot;&gt;HOW THE QUESTIONNAIRES WERE CONDUCTED&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We partnered with an organization that has a successful track record of managing discrete and careful questionnaires in North Korea. The interviews were conducted during the second half of 2023, with the survey in the field from September to December 2023. Our total survey population was 100 North Koreans living in the country. Interviewees consisted of 60 females and 40 males and represented a wide range of ages, occupations, household sizes, and education levels. Geographically, respondents were also divided across North Korea’s nine provinces and the capital city of Pyongyang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 6: Household Size of Survey Respondents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questionnaires were conducted through casual, in-person conversations between interviewers and respondents. The interviewers were carefully trained to avoid leading questions or prompting specific responses to protect the integrity of the survey and the safety of all participants. The interviewers used “snowball sampling” to conduct the conversation, which involves a main group of informants bringing in additional participants. This method would not be considered ideal under normal circumstances, as it does not constitute random sampling and therefore cannot mitigate the risk of several forms of bias being introduced into the data when participants may know one another or share common experiences, political attitudes, socioeconomic backgrounds, etc., but conditions in North Korea are far from normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Random sampling would be extremely difficult to organize, as population lists and demographic data are not publicly available and participating in surveys that are not authorized by the government is extremely dangerous. As polling expert Karl Friedhoff noted in a commentary on surveys in North Korea, “Working in circumstances as difficult as these requires that normal methodological rigor be put aside. The very serious risks assumed by everyone involved demand it.” In another article on survey work inside the DPRK, public opinion researcher Myong-Hyun Go stated that there can be important advantages to conducting survey work among acquaintances in North Korea, as the participants can trust that interviewers will protect their confidentiality, which increases the likelihood that they will provide truthful responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the interviewers prioritized the safety of the participants in considering their methodology, as no one could protect survey participants if the government found out about their activities. For this reason, this report does not reveal information that could identify participants. Due to these sampling constraints, this report’s observations should not be interpreted as a complete representation of views in North Korea. In addition, the absence of a testing regime and lack of communication by the government (discussed below), means that citizens’ reporting of their challenges in dealing with COVID-19 were based on their own assumptions about, rather than confirmation of, the virus. But they still provide the first glimpse into the experiences of ordinary North Koreans during the country’s most extreme period of isolation arguably in its history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our observations are further informed by the North Korean regime’s well-documented track record of systemic human rights abuses and oppressive governance as detailed by sources like Freedom House’s annual Freedom in the World Report, the U.S. State Department’s annual report on human rights, and the 2014 United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the DPRK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-we-found&quot;&gt;WHAT WE FOUND&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questionnaire, our analysis of Pyongyang’s behavior during the pandemic, and the Kim Jong Un regime’s dismal track record on human rights revealed five observations on the COVID-19 experiences of the 100 North Korean responses related to the timing and severity of outbreaks; levels of medical support for everyday citizens; second-order effects of lockdown policies; access to information; and public responses to the regime’s handling of the pandemic. Collectively, these observations provide a window into the neglect and abuses of the government, as well as the depth and nature of hardships endured by our interviewees:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DPRK government purposefully misinformed these citizens and the global community about the extent of the pandemic inside North Korea. Deaths and suffering due to suspected COVID-19 cases were widespread in North Korea starting in 2020, despite government public proclamations to the World Health Organization (WHO) of “zero cases,” and well before the first official announcement of an outbreak in May 2022. Based on the number of people who were given access to testing and vaccines after May 2022, many lives could have been saved if the government had been truthful about the extent of the pandemic to outside health authorities and accepted international help from the onset of the crisis in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to May 2022, citizens had virtually no access to vaccines, no antiviral medications, and minimal supply of personal protective equipment. It’s probable that the national government dealt with the pandemic crisis by essentially shirking any responsibility and allowing the populace to fend for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s likely that the regime’s strict lockdown policies extended well beyond the survey population and deepened the suffering of ordinary North Koreans by exacerbating preexisting food and medicine shortages and providing new justifications for surveillance and extreme punishments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Individuals and agencies at the local level hesitated to provide truthful reports about suspected cases because of fear of punishment for not echoing the government’s disinformation about “zero cases.” It’s probable that the resulting void of accurate information about COVID-19 among the North Korean public exacerbated suffering through the further spread of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resentment and cynicism toward the government, as well as the use of bribery to undermine quarantine rules, were widespread, according to the 100 respondents, suggesting that the pandemic generated new sources of vulnerability for the regime even as it used antivirus measures to tighten social control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the last observation, the interviews indicated that the pandemic was a period of intense regime surveillance, new restrictions on freedom of movement, and punishments for minor infractions, but it was also a time when ordinary North Koreans witnessed, firsthand, the ineffectiveness of government policies and privately vented frustrations and sought ways to circumvent new rules. Considering the level of punishment individuals face for criticizing the regime in North Korea (imprisonment or death), the frankness of responses to the questionnaires we recorded was notable. And while bribery is not a new practice in North Korea, pandemic quarantine rules provided new opportunities for this segment of the informal economy to expand. Such private, isolated expressions of regime resentment and practices to undermine regime authority could snowball into more visible and widespread forms of rebellion on short notice. Governments that would be directly affected by a DPRK regime collapse should incorporate “hardened shell, weakened underbelly” scenarios into their analyses and preparations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections detail these observations and discuss their implications for policy and future research focused on North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observation one:&lt;/strong&gt; The DPRK government purposefully misinformed its citizens and the global community about the extent of the pandemic inside North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the DPRK’s regular updates to the World Health Organization (WHO) on COVID-19 reporting “zero cases” until April 2022, interviewees report that COVID-19 infections were rampant in the country starting in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/p7i7QpV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 7: Have you or anyone you know been infected with COVID-19?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, when asked whether they or anyone they know has been infected with the COVID-19 virus (Question 7), 92 of 100 respondents answered “yes.” Among these affirmative responses, only 33 cases were specified as occurring in April 2022 or later, while 62 cases were reported to have occurred between May 2020 and March 2022 (Question 7b). Some respondents reported multiple dates for themselves, a family member, or a neighbor, resulting in the total number of cases exceeding the number of participants who answered “yes” to Question 7. Survey respondents reported being diagnosed or placed under quarantine in hospitals, clinics, or military clinics, as captured in survey Question 7f.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern was observed in Pyongyang, where more respondents (6 of 14) identified cases occurring before April 2022 than after (2 of 14); the remaining respondents did not specify exact timing. Given what we know about how COVID-19 spread, the fact that 92 of the 100 people interviewed knew someone with COVID-19 suggests that the virus may have been widespread in the country long before the government’s first publicly reported case in April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The citizens surveyed were aware of severe community and nationwide outbreaks occurring well before April 2022 despite government disinformation downplaying the outbreak. Asked “When did you feel that the COVID-19 virus situation was at its worst in North Korea?” (Question 8), more than double the number of respondents judged the situation at its worst during the years 2020 and 2021 (50%) than during 2022 (24%). Five respondents listed two or three peak phases of the virus, including one soldier who identified three outbreaks in 2020, 2021, and 2022 and noted, “There was an increasing number of patients with body aches and fever who were unable to work, and military doctors (medical officers) said that they could not prescribe medicine despite it likely being COVID-19. The disease suddenly spread.” One worker from a detention center also identified three outbreaks in 2020, 2021, and 2022, stating that “prison guards, foot soldiers, and employees were not allowed to leave work for seven to 10 days” during an April-August 2021 outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those interviewed suggested the scope of the outbreaks was wide, encompassing many public locations. When asked where the situation was the worst, common responses included specific locations such as schools (13 of 100), neighborhoods (11 of 100), factories (9 of 100), and military facilities (9 of 100). One notable response from a soldier stated that “half (360-400 people) of four companies in the mobile communications battalion” were affected by an outbreak in November 2021. One respondent who identified an October 2020 outbreak in a food factory said, “More than 10 people missed work because they were sick, and some people collapsed while working in the field and got taken to a hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DJjYEVS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Locations of Severe Outbreaks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a testing regime or other official metrics, most of the North Koreans who were interviewed could only deduce the seriousness and location of the outbreaks by the prevalence of severe illness or deaths (Question 8).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of COVID-19 tests, anyone with cold or fever symptoms was assumed to have contracted the virus. As one respondent whose family member became ill in November 2020 noted, “At the hospital, if a person has a fever and cold symptoms, it was suspected to be coronavirus.” Similarly, one respondent discussing a December 2021 case claimed, “They said it was COVID if you have a fever and cough.” Another, describing a case from May 2022, claimed, “City hospital decided that it could be a cold (flu) and that I was a confirmed COVID case.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five of 100 respondents referred to deaths as their main indicator for outbreaks. As one participant, who identified 2020-2022 as the worst phase of the pandemic, said, “Fevers were happening everywhere, and many people were dying within a few days.” A woman working in the student/education sector highlighted that conditions were particularly bad in winter 2020 “with a lot of cases across the country, students in schools, people in nursing homes.” Within nursing homes, she said, “there were so many deaths that there weren’t enough coffins, so I thought it was serious.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About another quarter of participants (23 of 100) indicated that they knew COVID-19 conditions were severe because of government actions, such as introducing strict quarantine rules or making public announcements. For instance, a woman who identified factories in October 2020 as a site of a severe outbreak claimed, “My daughter had to listen to explanations about COVID in her factory every morning, even outside of morning propaganda reading time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observation two:&lt;/strong&gt; Government negligence forced ordinary North Koreans to endure the pandemic on their own, with minimal access to professional health care, medicine, or COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees reported that the North Korean government’s support for its ordinary, nonelite citizens was virtually nonexistent, particularly during the first two years of the pandemic. This truth flies in the face of statements by the leadership that the DPRK’s “advantageous Korean-style socialist system” was a critical factor enabling the country to manage COVID-19. As one participant said, “The country says it provides free medical care, but there is no such thing as free, and when hardship strikes the country, people don’t look to anyone.” Another noted, “There’s nothing good for us if there’s no proclamation or declaration from the government. If we get sick, money is everything. They don’t give us anything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID-19 Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost 90 of 100 respondents had no access to COVID-19 testing during the pandemic. Of the small minority that did, most were not able to access testing during the first two years of the lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OYhK8DZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 8: Tested for COVID-19&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked whether they were ever tested for COVID-19 (Question 15), 87 of the 100 respondents said no. Of those who said yes, two indicated that they had privileged access through relatives, and three said they were tested through the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had the government been proactive in seeking international help for COVID-19, it could have limited the harm to its citizens. Our survey found that the majority of respondents who reported access to testing did so after 2022 (69% – 9 of 13 participants who had access to testing), likely after offers of testing and medical supplies from China increased following the first official announcement of an outbreak in May 2022. The remaining 31% of respondents (4 of 13 participants who had access to testing) did not specify a date, so it is unclear exactly when their tests occurred, though none explicitly reported access prior to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID-19 Vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ordinary public (defined as nonelites and nonmilitary) had limited access to COVID-19 vaccines, with almost 40 of 100 respondents reporting not having received a vaccine during the pandemic. The military was an exception and appears to have undergone a mandatory three-shot vaccination program with China-provided product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the ordinary members of the public who received vaccines, the majority of vaccinations for the people we interviewed happened after May 2022, though the country reportedly began receiving assistance from China months earlier. This again indicates that the government could have averted many deaths if it had reported outbreaks to, and sought help from, international health authorities during the first two years of the pandemic. The government declined international offers of the AstraZeneca and Sinovac vaccines in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KcHPRuH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 9: Availability and Timing of Vaccines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eighty-two percent of those North Koreans who indicated that they had been vaccinated for COVID-19 received their first shot after May 2022 (Question 15[2]). By comparison, South Korean citizens started receiving their first jabs in February 2021; in the United States, vaccine programs started in December 2020. Fifty-seven percent of respondents who were vaccinated (35 out of 61) referred to receiving their shots “as a group,” either by neighborhood watch units, in hospitals, at schools, or in the workplace. Soldiers indicated that they received three vaccines in 2022, most likely in May, July, and September, and some indicated that the shots were mandatory. Soldiers said the vaccines were from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results track with external media accounts suggesting that the DPRK accepted and started administering vaccines from China from June 2022. The timing of “group jabs,” mostly occurring in late 2022 or early 2023, further coincides with Kim Jong Un’s September 2022 announcement of a vaccination campaign to begin at an unspecified time in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government supply of masks was insufficient, with most interviewees reporting buying, making, and reusing them. Children were especially disadvantaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only eight of our 100 respondents said the government provided masks as an infection control measure. However, citizens understood the value of PPE because when asked, “Did you wear a mask while the coronavirus was spreading?” (Question 14), all of the participants replied yes, but most either purchased the masks in the market (28), made the masks themselves (17), or both bought and made masks (22) (Question 14b). Multiple responses were allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only one of 100 responses indicated that “children were prioritized for masks” to Question 13, part 5: “Did schools, neighborhood watch units, or the government take measures related to children?” One respondent noted: “Adults were given one dose [mask] during the entire COVID period, but children had to make their own because the size was small.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A notable number of respondents (21 of 100) indicated that they washed their masks frequently for reuse, which, unbeknownst to them, did little to prevent infection. As one participant noted, “Washing and using disposable masks from the market lasted up to a week. More people washed and used homemade masks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees reported that the government generally neglected providing support to the needy, while ensuring extra support to elite groups during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those surveyed perceived that elite groups – such as those associated with the party, government, military, or others that the regime designated as “special subjects” – were recipients of extra support. Participants indicated that small amounts of food and medical supplies were provided to households designated as starving or poor. However, over half (54 of 100) responded that no action was taken to help vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only device to which North Korean respondents reported having access to combat the pandemic was a thermometer, which they often had to acquire themselves by purchasing, borrowing from a neighbor, or pleading with provincial officials. When asked “During the COVID outbreak in 2022, were you or people you know able to get thermometers?” (Question 18), 87 of 100 respondents said they were able to, but respondents noted that domestically produced thermometers did not work and that there were price spikes for imported thermometers from China – in some cases as high as a fivefold increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a limited testing regimen and limited vaccines, interviewees reported relying on self-isolation and home remedies – everything from saltwater rinses to making garlic clove necklaces – to counter the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ninety-five of our 100 respondents said that they isolated, mostly at home, for anywhere from three days to three months (Question 16a, Question 16b, Question 16c). Only 11 said that they were able to receive regular health checkups during the COVID-19 lockdown(s) (Question 19).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants shared a number of home self-treatments and folk remedies (Question 15):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Opium shots for immunity”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Saltwater treatments: gargle rinsing, toothbrushing, bathing, inhaling burning wormwood&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cold towel compresses&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sauna/sweating&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Root tea, juniper seed tea, “10 ginko nuts for tea”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Garlic clove necklaces&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gochujang soup&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mixing various combinations of garlic, scallions, miso, and chili powder or red pepper flakes with water&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lockdown exacerbated already depleted stocks of medicines in North Korea, making them scarce, expensive, and sometimes only available through black market sellers. Many respondents reported avoiding asking health authorities for cold medicines because the request could trigger quarantine. For those who could afford it, they resorted to black market sellers (at inflated prices). For those who couldn’t, they simply did without any pharmaceutical interventions and coped with only home remedies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/e9DRt3B.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 10: Was the treatment and supply of medicine sufficient?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifty-seven of our 100 respondents said that they had no medicine or insufficient access, likely due to shortages in government-provided supplies, while only 13 stated that they had sufficient or moderately sufficient supplies (Question 16d). Fifteen said they purchased medicine on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When respondents suspected or confirmed a COVID-19 infection through testing, they generally reported that medicines (such as cold and fever medications, anti-inflammatories, upset stomach medicine, etc.) were only available for people to purchase themselves in the markets or pharmacies, obtain from acquaintances, or rely on existing home supply (about 70 of 100) (Question 15, part 5). A number of respondents (19 of 100) indicated that they relied on black market sellers or vendors for medicine. As a woman who works in the party/government agency noted, “Medicine, I bought it secretly from someone at their home. The government cracked down on such home pharmacies, so they only sold to people they knew.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many also highlighted price gouging, which made the situation more challenging. As one respondent noted, “I should’ve purchased it at the market, but I couldn’t afford it.” Another said, “During the pandemic, medicines dried up, and the price increased a lot, so it was difficult to buy them.” Imported medicines were reportedly hardest to find (Question 17). One participant said, “… imports were not coming in due to border closures, so the prices were high, and I could not fulfill my needs.” Another participant said, “No basic medicines such as antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, general cold medicine, diarrhea medicine, etc. were available. No Chinese medicines were available, or they were priced eight to 10 times higher.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exceptions to citizens’ scarce access to pharmaceuticals were the military and party elites. Soldiers in the respondent pool said they were able to procure medicine from military centers or clinics. Other respondents (who were not soldiers) said they were able to get medicine from their health care provider (3 of 100), from their workplace within a party or government agency (1 of 100), or from their university pharmacy (1 of 100).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Climate of Desperation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s neglect in providing any pandemic support or accurate information to its citizens engendered a climate of desperation in which citizens misused medicine or were victimized by fraudulent salesmen. This misuse of medicine in several cases caused further deaths and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A substantial number of respondents (20) said they were aware of damage, and even death, caused by medicines that were either folk remedies, fake, or not taken properly (Question 15[6]). For instance, one respondent noted, “There were a lot of fake medicines, and people died because they couldn’t use real medicine.” Another said, “There are a few people who died because they should have taken medicine that suits their illness, but if they hear a medicine is good, they start taking it without looking into what it really is.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fake traditional Chinese medicines were a concern for one respondent, who said, “The mother of a farmer’s wife at the funeral took fever medicine, sore throat medicine, and anti-inflammatory medicine from the market, but died of side effects from fake drugs (many of the traditional Chinese drugs were counterfeit).” Two respondents referred to the misuse of penicillin, such as one who noted, “Someone I know in Ganggu died after receiving the wrong penicillin.” In two cases, the use of opium was mentioned, such as the participant who said, “Unable to wake up after receiving opiates.” Three cases involved using the wrong dosage for children, including a baby who died because his mom “gave him a full pill instead of a quarter pill per day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observation three:&lt;/strong&gt; Suffering among North Korean respondents in our survey was exacerbated by the government’s strict quarantine policies, a worsening food crisis, and extreme punishments for breaking antivirus rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government relied almost entirely on nonpharmaceutical interventions to combat the pandemic. This entailed severely restricting citizens’ movements around the country, a crackdown on all market activity (both official and black market), school closures, and the blocking of all trade and travel with China. These measures exacerbated economic downturns and food and medicine shortages. By comparison, in the mid-1990s when the public distribution (ration) system broke down, the government allowed the people to fend for themselves through the creation of informal markets. But no such compensation mechanism existed during the pandemic when the public health system failed to protect the people. According to survey respondents, the only mechanisms created to fill the medical vacuum were home remedies and fraudulent pharmaceuticals which, as noted above, resulted in fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responses to the survey indicate that the external border lockdown starting in January 2020, internal quarantine measures, and a series of new stringent anti-epidemic laws worsened already-dismal economic, food, and human rights conditions in the country. Seventy-seven of our 100 respondents said it was “impossible” to travel to other areas in search of food during the pandemic (Question 23). Controls appeared to be strictest in Pyongyang, South Hamgyong, and Jagang. Members of the military were granted special permission to move around, noting “ordinary citizens not allowed to move around; military messengers with approved travel orders (etc.) could.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eighty-one of 100 respondents indicated that they experienced acute food shortages during the COVID-19 lockdowns (Question 22). One participant noted, “Food was too expensive, and I didn’t have enough money to make ends meet.” Another respondent simply stated, “I thought I was going to die.” Soldiers who responded weren’t spared from the food crisis; six out of the seven soldiers in the survey sample indicated that they experienced food shortages: “Everyone was quarantined in their houses (even if it was just one person), and the quarantine periods were very long, so you had to have emergency food at home. If you didn’t, it was really tough.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market was the only place North Koreans could acquire needed items, but the lockdown created shortages of goods, and scarcity led to price surges that made the goods unaffordable. Ninety-seven of 100 respondents identified scarcity and price spikes for food, imported medicine, and other necessities (Question 17). One respondent pointed out an underlying irony of the strict quarantine measures, noting, “They say that people are quarantined and controlled to ensure that there is no risk to people’s lives and safety, but because of this, their lives and safety are more at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BmERDOH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Selection of COVID-19-era violations and punishments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those we surveyed indicated that those who were caught breaking lockdown rules were severely punished. Eighty-five of 100 survey participants indicated that rule breakers were punished during the “emergency anti-epidemic period,” (2020-2023; Question 11) most often by sending them to forced labor camps (48 responses mentioned forced labor camp or imprisonment). Examples of a range of violations and corresponding punishments are provided in Table 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military service members seemed to be spared from the harshest punishments but still received sanctions. For instance, one soldier noted, “A midlevel soldier in the battalion sneaked out in the evening because he was hungry and was caught by the owner of a farm with kimchi.” As a result, “The battalion begged for forgiveness at the village party committee and the midlevel soldier was demoted to sergeant.” Another soldier said, “Two of the (military) company’s officers took off their masks because it was hot.” Their punishment was “one month punishment work (cleaning the latrine).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observation four:&lt;/strong&gt; Local health officials misreported COVID-19 deaths and diagnoses to align with government directives that the DPRK had “zero” cases (before 2022). This resulted in a doubling of misinformation whereby the government and citizenry each lied to the other, creating further spread of the pandemic. We believe the responsibility for this disaster lies squarely at the feet of the government because its disinformation, draconian NPIs (lockdowns), resultant food shortages, and lack of PPE provision forced the public ultimately to behave in self-destructive ways in order to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government compiled statistics on cases within the country but did not disseminate the results broadly or consistently to everyday citizens. Most participants (87 of 100) indicated that government entities – including neighborhood watch units, security officers, quarantine centers, health clinics, and people’s committees – initially recorded data from fever checks and household inspections on severe and fatal cases of COVID-19 (Q12) for reports to central authorities. But little feedback or help came from the government other than lockdowns which exacerbated food shortages. For example, only 41 of 100 participants indicated that they ever received the investigation results of COVID-19 cases reported through official government channels (Question 12c). Official channels included neighborhood watch unit meetings, doctors, epidemic prevention centers, security guards, party officials, state TV broadcasts, or government-sponsored meetings and lectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One participant stated: “The results were not well communicated. Don’t know exactly,” while another noted, “[We got information] through rumors. They didn’t share investigation results.” Respondents indicated that the frequency of checks decreased over time, including one who said the checks were “initially managed by doctors who did rounds, but not since late 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doubling Misinformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official government policy before May 2022 stated that the country had “zero” cases. Respondents indicated that local reports of outbreaks were therefore met with censure and even punishments. It’s likely the combination of disinformation and blatant negligence from the government, food shortages, and the desire to avoid draconian lockdowns compelled the citizenry to take harmful actions for themselves. Accounts suggested that doctors, local officials, and ordinary citizens preferred not to record symptomatic cases, either to protect individuals from quarantine or to avoid criticism from the central government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one participant said, the “clinic doctor told me that I have COVID and that if I say that, I will be taken away.” Another noted, “It is more advantageous to say that people died of other diseases even though they know that they died of COVID because it is obvious that the living people will be quarantined for a long time and suffer more due to the spread of the virus.” Another testified, “I treated myself because I’m afraid they’ll look at me like a criminal if I told them.” Yet another testified, “I realized that serious illnesses and deaths were not reported because they were told not to call it COVID, but they were related to COVID. It may be a lie to say that COVID did not come to Korea before January 2022.” Table 3 contains a sample of responses showing the widespread practice of misreporting COVID-19 cases for fear of lockdown or censure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FWAcNrM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: North Korean Citizenry Forced to Misreport COVID-19 Cases for Fear of Censure and Lockdown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under normal circumstances, and in almost every other country in the world, it would have been the responsibility of citizens and health officials to accurately report COVID-19 data, but North Korean citizens could not be blamed for the widespread inaccurate reporting. We know from sources like the Freedom in the World Report that North Koreans have virtually nonexistent civil liberties or political rights and that they lack any mediating institutions independent of the regime. As such, that responsibility sits entirely with the government for creating a poisonous atmosphere of distrust with the public. Rather than being able to look to the government for medical help, citizens experienced a situation in which reporting sickness meant forced individual detention or collective lockdowns, either of which would exacerbate acute food shortages. The only way to survive or avoid punishment was to misreport, which in the end only caused the pandemic to spread further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our survey showed that mistrust of the government was rampant among respondents. Only a minority of respondents (35 of 100) said they trusted information from government-affiliated sources such as Rodong Sinmun (Question 28). Most (73 of 100) said they sought out information through unofficial channels (Question 27).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OLtadcl.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 11: Levels of Trustworthiness of Government Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many simply responded “believed,” or “disbelieved,” some participants elaborated on their reasons for not trusting the government. For instance, one Kangwon resident noted, “No. The government has never really said anything true.” Some respondents said, “I believed the quarantine instructions, but I didn’t believe the other announcements because they were mostly lies.” Another said, “I believe what I see, and I don’t believe what I don’t see.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vast majority of the survey respondents (83 of 100) identified discrepancies between government announcements and their own experiences of the pandemic (Question 29). More than half of the participants (60 of 100) expressed doubts about the DPRK’s official statements regarding having the virus under control during the early years of the pandemic. For instance, one respondent stated, “The government is saying that the world is in chaos due to COVID and that the country is well protected, but, in fact, many people are dying because they have no money to eat and cannot get medicine.” Another noted, “The government was ridiculous when they said that other countries had a lot of deaths from COVID but we had no deaths.” And a third declared, “They say there are no deaths because of good quarantine efforts, but I think there are many deaths.” A soldier was similarly skeptical, noting, “They fooled soldiers for two years in 2020 and 2021, saying that COVID was under control and that they could take cold medicine because it wasn’t COVID. COVID has already spread in our country, and the cold my daughter had was COVID.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others scoffed at the regime’s propaganda. As one respondent said, “Other countries have many deaths due to COVID, and the economic situation is bad due to restrictions on entering and leaving the border, but DPRK is touting that there are no deaths due to the government’s measures and thorough countermeasures, but in reality, there are many complaints from households.” Another noted, “The government says they are treating patients with domestic medicine to overcome it, but many people haven’t even tried it because of the shortage of medicine.” A third participant found it hard to believe “That we closed our borders because we prioritized the well-being and health of our people,” noting that “there are many people with severe aftereffects from COVID.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disinformation Campaigns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government disseminated heavy doses of disinformation, including assertions of “zero cases” inside the DPRK due to “successful socialism” and conspiracy theories about U.S. and South Korean germ warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly 70% (69 of 100) of respondents correctly identified China (with some more specifically citing Wuhan) as the site of the first COVID-19 outbreak, and many others understood that the virus had spread to many parts of the world (Question 26). Yet the regime used this information to propagandize the success of its own pandemic efforts, in contrast with other countries. A Pyongyang resident noted, “The COVID situation was constantly and continuously broadcast on TV and in the newspapers, but the most common thing I heard was that other countries are suffering a lot, but the DPRK is overcoming the crisis well due to Kim Jong Un’s wise leadership.” Another respondent said, “At every meeting and lecture, they touted the superiority of socialism by reporting on the situation and deaths of COVID patients in countries around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than one-third of respondents (35 of 100) believed that South Korea sent the virus into the DPRK through various means, including balloons, imported rice, leaflets, and “unauthorized river crossers.” As one participant said, “They say it all came from China, but South Korea sent it in, because South Korea has a bad relationship with our country.” Another noted, “Heard that South Korea shot at us with germs (weapons? balloons? guns?).” These accounts echo the August 2022 claims of Kim Yo Jong, Kim Jong Un’s sister, that South Korea’s anti-Pyongyang leaflets were to blame for spreading COVID-19 in the DPRK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A subset of respondents rejected government-fueled conspiracies identifying South Korea as the source of the virus. For instance, one respondent said, “I’m convinced that it’s wrong that COVID came in from South Korea and that it spread the virus (here); what’s the point of sending it from South Korea through leaflets or whatever?” Another said, “The reason why the government didn’t make it clear that COVID started in China – for fear of losing goodwill with China. Pushing it off on South Korea muddies the waters.” Notably, respondents from Kangwon, which borders South Korea, pushed back against Kim Yo Jong’s claim that leaflets from the South spread the virus, noting “Kangwon Province has nothing to do with COVID”; “Comrade Kim Yeo-jung’s statement about COVID outbreak in Kangwon Province is not true”; and “I don’t believe China would’ve allowed South Korea to come in and spread the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some of the most elaborate conspiratorial accounts, the source of information was unclear. For instance, one respondent noted, “I heard that the U.S. will make COVID viruses to spread in China and to bully China. And that the medicine is made in the U.S., so they are making money.” Another said, “It’s an American operation. No, there is nothing the U.S. can’t do, they told us.” And a soldier noted, “I heard that China had COVID first, but it was a U.S. CIA-run lab that ran germ tests and that it was a U.S. plot to ruin China (on purpose) and kill the 30 million people of the DPRK by sending it across the border.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observation five:&lt;/strong&gt; Many respondents expressed resentment toward the government’s handling of the pandemic. This precipitated a willingness to circumvent quarantine rules through bribery, revealing new areas of vulnerability for the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A collection of anecdotal responses to various survey questions revealed frustrations with several aspects of the government’s handling of the pandemic. Many respondents compared their situations unfavorably to the circumstances they heard about in other countries. For instance, one respondent noted, “I heard that other countries have all their COVID shots, and if you get sick, they’ll cover your medication. In my country, if you have a fever, all you can do is quarantine or go into lockdown.” Another said, “We’re the only country that still has its borders closed following COVID. I heard that (people in other countries) began living their lives as normal soon after COVID began. I heard that people got free medicine if they got COVID. Our country doesn’t care if you live or die.” Similarly, a third participant noted, “People in other countries can travel the world, but we still can’t even walk on certain roads.” And a fourth said, “I heard that the DPRK doesn’t test for COVID, but other countries do. There is a lockdown here, but I heard this isn’t the case in other countries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grassroots Anger and Frustration at Government Elites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents expressed deep frustration and anger with preferential treatment for North Korean government elites, particularly related to accessing medicine and COVID-19 vaccines while the general public suffered. As one participant said, “Many people died crossing the border during COVID. The dead bodies were left there to become fish food. They burned a South Korean person who crossed the border from South Korea due to the virus. The central party cadres are using COVID medicines but not taking care of the people.” Another noted, “In my country, only the central party cadres are considered people, and the real people are treated worse than pigs…. COVID is like a cold if you get a vaccination.” A third said, “The Central Committee cadres used illicit drugs during COVID, but they only used good-quality stuff. It was better than the stuff circulating in ordinary society.” And a fourth said, “It was rumored that everyone would be jabbed when the vaccine came in from China, but only the top officials got it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three further responses along similar lines: “Central Committee cadres were jabbed with (vaccines) made in the U.S. during COVID”; “the central party cadres were jabbed several times since the beginning of the lockdown, and the people were jabbed once with something they don’t have any idea about where it’s from”; and “Central Committee officials jabbed with U.S.-made COVID shots. People are treated like animals, viruses similar to COVID will continue to emerge in the future, and COVID is now treated like a cold. North Korea refused to take vaccines offered by other countries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest category of frustrations focused on the general ineffectiveness of government’s COVID-19- related decisions, such as refusing vaccines or other forms of aid from other countries and prolonging the border lockdown as the world began to reopen. One respondent said, “Only my country has closed borders and doesn’t allow travel between regions, and I heard that other countries offered vaccines, but we refused. They don’t care whether the people live or die because they have good quality medicine and got jabs.” Another noted, “The U.N. said they were going to give our country medicine and rice, but the Supreme Leader stopped them. Even if these things were imported, they wouldn’t give it to us for free, so why can’t we buy it and consume it?” A third said, “They claim to have an emergency quarantine campaign in place, but they only conduct crackdowns and don’t let us make a living.” And a fourth participant noted, “Nothing was right. I’m nervous about the number of COVID patients, the number of deaths, the number of severely ill patients, and why they still don’t open the border when other countries are fine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s negligence during the pandemic pierced the propagated myth in North Korea that the regime’s leadership and actions are unquestionable. Some responses directly challenged the notion that the regime cares about its people. As one Pyongyang resident said, “When I see saw the Supreme Leader touting his leadership, love of the people, and the superiority of the Republic while announcing that there are almost no deaths in the Republic, even though so many people have died during COVID, I think of the people who have died without being able to get the medicine they needed.” And another respondent noted, “Even when COVID was said to be over, many people were still sick. The number of COVID cases, the number of deaths, they say that everything (they do) is for the people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some respondents questioned the regime’s prizing nuclear weaponization over the pandemic. For instance, one respondent said, “The DPRK government developed nuclear weapons during COVID, but it didn’t care about feeding its people.” Another noted, “Other countries have all the COVID shots and give free medicine if you get COVID, but we don’t have medicine. Border is closed because of COVID, so it’s not likely to open. I heard many people who made a lot of money while working in COVID-19 related agencies. More people are starving than sick, and the DPRK blows money on missile launches.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fair to say the pandemic gave the North Korean government unprecedented power to control and lock down its population even by its own standards. But this period of draconian control seems to have created antibodies among a society that revealed cracks in the façade of the regime. It’s likely that what motivated this societal resistance was, at its core, a basic will to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citizens’ resistance came in the form of disbelief and criticism of the regime’s directives and propaganda as described above, but it was also evident in behavior such as widespread bribery to flout quarantine restrictions during the pandemic. Bribery is arguably one of the most threatening activities to the regime because it compels collusion between the citizens and the government officials against the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A majority of respondents (62 of 100) said they had given bribes to circumvent quarantine restrictions (Question 24). Many citizens engaged in bribery more than once or twice to as many as 11 times. Amounts varied, from 50,000 up to 500,000 North Korean won. Boxes of cigarettes were another common form of payment. Moreover, the targets of the bribes were almost all conceivable levels of government, party, and the military, including police officers, “officials in charge of special documents,” epidemic prevention officers or quarantine officers, police or security officers, and doctors in a clinic. Answers to the question “to whom” the bribe was paid included local officials of various types. All but one of the seven soldiers in the survey were willing to engage in offering and accepting bribes during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limited resources and time prevented us from deeper questioning of respondents on resistance to the government. While the survey documents grassroots anger and frustration with the government and episodic efforts to flout government restrictions, we are unable to determine based on this evidence whether the pandemic created conditions for regime instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-and-research-implications&quot;&gt;POLICY AND RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For governments and international organizations seeking to improve the welfare of North Koreans, these observations can guide positions, initiatives, and policies on a range of issues. Many of these recommendations involve enhancing or continuing existing initiatives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do not accept official DPRK statements or data at face value. A good rule of thumb is do not trust, and verify.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gathering as much information as possible regarding conditions within the country from a broad range of sources – rather than relying primarily on DPRK state media reporting and official announcements – continues to be the best strategy for seeking truth on the ground in North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;International organizations like the WHO should attach caveats to reports and statements that include data supplied by the North Korean government, indicating their degree of confidence in and ability to independently verify the information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even if the North Korean government is likely to reject it, continue to offer humanitarian aid when needed. Aid offers should be conditioned on North Korea’s acceptance of international access and monitoring standards and delinked from progress on security issues like denuclearization. Survey responses indicated dire shortages of medical supplies and food during the pandemic, as well as an awareness, among some participants, that their government rejected offers of much-needed humanitarian assistance from the U.N. and countries like the United States and South Korea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At worst, the aid will be rejected, but at least some North Koreans who hear about such offers will question how “hostile” these donor countries really are.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At best, the aid – along with access and monitoring conditions – will be accepted, leading to improved conditions for North Koreans and enhanced reach for humanitarian organizations. While the risk remains that aid could be diverted to benefit only the regime elites, sustained efforts to enforce monitoring standards and to work through trusted humanitarian institutions and actors on the ground will be critical to mitigating this risk and ensuring that aid reaches the most vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devise and support legislative and nongovernmental organization initiatives to increase North Koreans’ access to accurate outside information. Responses indicate that many North Koreans are receiving some accurate information, along with significant amounts of misinformation, about the outside world through a mix of official and unofficial channels. Efforts to identify, tap, and expand unofficial channels, while minimizing the risks of punishment or imprisonment for recipients, would help to replace conspiracies (like those about the United States and South Korea) with facts and enhance the ability of North Koreans to evaluate their own conditions relative to the rest of the world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;For those in the United States and allied governments working to identify and prepare for potential DPRK regime collapse scenarios, keep in mind that periods of increased authoritarian control can simultaneously generate new, less visible sources of regime vulnerability. Survey responses revealed that the pandemic brought both new forms of repression and surveillance, as well as new opportunities for North Korean citizens to see their government’s ineptitude in action. In turn, ordinary North Koreans found new ways to challenge and circumvent the system, including through bribery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small-scale antiregime expressions and practices could swell quickly into broader forms of rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Government analyses of DPRK regime collapse contingencies should add “hardened shell, weakened underbelly” scenarios into their studies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continue to systematically document evidence of human rights abuses to support possible future prosecutions of North Korean leaders. Survey responses provided ample new evidence of human rights violations suffered by North Koreans, including in the areas of rights to freedom of movement and freedom from cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This information should be provided to organizations that are creating evidence repositories that could be used in criminal accountability processes someday, including the U.N.’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interview results also point to areas of fruitful future research on North Korea:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On global health, the findings can help to inform analyses of likely DPRK strategies in future pandemics: Will North Korea employ a similar total lockdown approach or alter its course due to the ineffectiveness of many of its COVID-19 policies, as indicated in the accounts of many survey participants?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the area of North Korea’s informal market economy, the survey provides information on the role of black market sellers (also referred to as “private sellers,” “private vendors,” and “dealers”) when more regular market activity has been shut down. Future studies could explore the degree to which these private activities continue or decrease as the country reopens.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regarding the North Korean military, future research could explore the degree to which the aspects of the preferential treatment of the military broke down during the pandemic, as soldiers who participated in the survey shared stories of hardship due to food shortages that echoed the experiences of civilians. Studies could also look into whether corruption within the military and other security establishments increased during the pandemic, insofar as the quarantine system offered new opportunities for bribery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On North Korean human rights, future studies could track the degree to which new forms and levels of surveillance and repression that the regime introduced during the pandemic are rolled back or maintained as the country reopens.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regarding DPRK internal stability, future research could explore whether expressions of resentment toward the regime decrease as the country reopens and more normal economic and social activity resumes or remains the same. Comparisons of expressions of resentment between specific sectors or regions would also be interesting to track.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DPRK’s ability to weather the extreme isolation during the pandemic lockdown raises serious questions about the effectiveness of international sanctions in fomenting a change in regime behavior or even in its stability. While not writing off the need for sanctions, the COVID-19 experience suggests the need for discriminating study of which sanctions under what conditions might prove most effective in achieving policy results.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report paints a grim picture of conditions in North Korea during its three-and-a-half-year COVID-19-induced lockdown. Isolation, economic and social challenges, and widespread deaths and severe illness were experienced in many countries around the world during the pandemic. But extreme risks of starvation, multiple rejections of international offers of vaccines, official denials of widespread illness, and forced labor camps were not. As the interview results attest, the policies and brutality of Kim Jong Un’s regime made worse a terrible situation sparked by the onset of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have not come across many firsthand accounts of life in North Korea, the depths of suffering that these findings reveal may come as a shock. However, the community of experts who routinely track developments in the DPRK will be less surprised. Sadly, the results represent more continuity than change in compounding the hardships of everyday life for North Koreans. But that does not detract from their importance and potential impact. The information provided here will hopefully aid efforts to document human rights abuses during the DPRK’s deepest period of isolation, inform present day policy and research, and predict future developments in North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

But for now, the impact on Iran’s nuclear programme is more uncertain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Operation Rising Lion had begun in the early hours of 13 June, he was declaring war and putting into action Israeli military planning years in the making to launch the largest attack on Iran since the 1980-89 Iran-Iraq War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an operation that is reported to be planned to last week, these are the early moments. Much is unclear, but some early deductions can be drawn from the first 72 hours of exchanges between Israel and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ambitious-and-sweeping-operations&quot;&gt;Ambitious and Sweeping Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size of the operation dwarfs any previously attempted, with the first 24 hours reportedly involving over 200 combat aircraft striking over a hundred targets. Videos released by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) show a range of aircraft involved in the operation, including F-15I, F-16I and F-35I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the stated target was the Iranian nuclear programme, the initial wave of attacks struck a much broader range of targets, including Iran’s military leadership, conventional military sites (including both ballistic missile production and storage) and air defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gsZY2is.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following 48 hours saw smaller operations – but still involving around 50 aircraft for each wave of attack – and more strikes on Natanz alongside a number of other nuclear sites. By 15 June Israel had struck over 250 targets, and launched new attacks on Iranian energy infrastructure, especially oil and gas facilities, as well as government targets, reportedly including the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) in Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-shadow-war-becomes-open-war&quot;&gt;The Shadow War Becomes Open War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking elements of the whole operation was a complementary covert Mossad operation to insert commando teams and weapons into Iran. This allowed them to launch missiles remotely, and loitering munitions/drones ahead of or in coordination with the incoming Israeli attack aircraft, destroying air defences to make their job easier, as well as striking ballistic missile launchers before they could participate in the Iranian retaliation. The video released to showcase this stunning operation was a demonstration of Israel’s success in building up and sustaining a covert action network in Iran over several years, last seen when Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran in July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strikes-on-nuclear-sites-and-assassinations-of-scientists&quot;&gt;Strikes on Nuclear Sites and Assassinations of Scientists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent to which Israel has succeeded in undermining the nuclear programme is not yet clear, though the attacks carried out thus far are not sufficient to deal a decisive blow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Natanz nuclear complex sustained serious damage on the first day of strikes. The above-ground part of the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant (PFEP), as well as electrical infrastructure at the complex, have been destroyed. The PFEP is one of three enrichment sites in Iran. As of May, the above-ground part of the facility was being used for R&amp;amp;D as well as for enriched uranium production, including with advanced centrifuge models, using three production-scale centrifuge cascades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facility was one of the sites being used for the enrichment of uranium to 60% uranium-235 – near the levels that are normally required for use in nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kDH6PHM.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Satellite image of damage to Natanz Enrichment Complex, 13 June, 2025, Natanz, Iran. Image: Courtesy of the Open Source Centre and Airbus Defence and Space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has thus far been no confirmation of any damage to Iran’s largest enrichment facility, the Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP), also located at Natanz. As of May, the FEP hosted 101 centrifuge cascades (82 operational) and was used for enriching natural uranium to 5% uranium-235. The facility is located underground; satellite imagery has not shown any strikes on the site. A sudden loss of power (resulting from the destruction of electrical infrastructure) or vibrations from strikes in the vicinity could have also caused damage to the centrifuges inside the FEP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran’s third enrichment facility – the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant (FFEP) – is buried deep underground, roughly 80-90 meters by some estimates. The facility hosts 16 installed (13 operational) cascades and plays a critical role in Iran’s production of fissile material. It is the primary site for the production of uranium enriched to 60% uranium-235, using advanced (IR-6) centrifuges and a 20% enriched uranium feed. This makes the FFEP central to Iran’s nuclear programme as the most hardened site, producing the greatest amount of highly-enriched uranium and with greater efficiency than its other facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wZ5bPYZ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Satellite image of damage to Isfahan Nuclear Facility, 15 June, 225, Isfahan, Iran. Image: Courtesy of the Open Source Centre and Airbus Defence and Space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Israel targeted the Fordow site on Friday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed the following day that no damage has been observed at the FFEP. Indeed, penetrating a facility as deeply buried as the FFEP is likely to require the use of heavy-penetrating munitions like the American GBU-57/B and would be predicated on US involvement in the strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides Iran’s uranium enrichment sites, Israel has also struck the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre, damaging the Uranium Conversion Facility (UCF) and the Fuel Plate Fabrication Plant (FPFP). The UCF, among other things, produced uranium hexafluoride for enrichment. The FPFP produced fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor and thus received at least some of Iran’s enriched uranium stocks. Both sites hosted capabilities for uranium metal production – a process key for the production of the core of a nuclear weapon; in 2021, uranium metal enriched to 20% had been produced at the FPFP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Iran’s nuclear installations, Israel has also gone after Iran’s nuclear expertise, assassinating more than a dozen Iranian nuclear scientists as of Sunday evening, and the headquarters of the Iranian nuclear organisation (SPND). There have also been some reports of strikes near Parchin – a military complex where Iran is believed to have previously conducted weapons-relevant activity – though the nature of the strikes or extent of any damage is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iran-strikes-backto-little-effect-so-far&quot;&gt;Iran Strikes Back…to Little Effect So Far&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For its part, the Iranian response (“Operation True Promise III”) has been more limited than the Israeli strikes, both in terms of effectiveness and scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An initial response of around 200 drones (probably Shahed-136) launched in two waves appears to have been almost completely defeated by Israeli ground and air-based defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequent drones launched piecemeal have met a similar fate, with Israeli defences bolstered by US forces (both a destroyer at sea and a THAAD battery based in Israel).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ballistic missile strikes have followed, predominantly aimed at Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Haifa. These have come in three main waves, with around 100 in the first strike, followed by several other smaller strikes. IDF officials in various media briefings on 15 June said these amounted to around 280 to nearly 300 ballistic missiles. This compares with just under 200 launched in a single night in Iran’s attack on Israel in October 2024. Around a dozen appear to have penetrated Israeli air defences, causing casualties, with perhaps a further 50 left unengaged by air defences, according to the IDF, as they were striking empty ground or non-vital targets. That leaves around 90% intercepted, most probably by Arrow 2 and 3 missiles, including some outside of the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;planning-and-preparation-prevents-poor-performance&quot;&gt;Planning and Preparation Prevents Poor Performance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the war for which Israel has been planning for over two decades, and notwithstanding the question of political-military objectives, the effects are clear to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the element of surprise and first-mover advantage, underpinned by effective intelligence, are obvious. Israel has been able to engage at a time and place of its choosing, and the extensive intelligence preparation it appears to have conducted have enabled precise timed operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Striking static nuclear sites is one thing, but identifying a series of leadership figures and being able to track and kill them near-simultaneously demonstrates extensive intelligence penetration of the Iranian system and, we might infer, real-time intelligence able to “fix” their locations. This also extends to the claim that the Israelis knew how the senior leadership of the IRGC Aerospace Forces would react in a crisis and could therefore time a strike to kill as many as possible. The ability to prepare and mount covert operations inside Iran, allegedly including the manufacture of drones in-country, is just another example of the effort in long-term covert action paying-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second visible effect of long-term planning is the obvious advantage conveyed by achieving air control, or in this case, air superiority (and the related importance of air defences).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that strike aircraft appeared carrying direct-attack weapons like JDAM as part of the attacks on the first night explains why so many of the strikes hit targets other than Natanz and suggests the Israelis achieved air control early on (aided by the Mossad operation and presumably F-35Is hitting air defences in the first wave). Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD came from a variety of sources and has opened up incredible freedom, to the extent that Israeli Heron drones have now been seen operating freely in Iranian airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, integrated air and missile defence is both vital in modern warfare and difficult. The near-total collapse of any effective Iranian air defence, identified as a weakness in advance – even after the warning from Israel last year – has critically undermined the Iranian response so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, Israel has the most extensive layered air-defence system in the world, boosted by the US and combined with an early warning system, prepared-procedures for civilian protection with bunkers and shelters, all of which give it resilience and thusly greater freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even this system, protecting a relatively small geographic area, is not infallible. So, Israel has sought to conduct an extensive interdiction campaign, striking Iranian launchers and storage sites before they can be put into operation, as well as the initial disruption of IRGC Aerospace Forces’ command and control. It has become popular to talk about “shooting the archer, not the arrow”; if Israeli claims that Iran intended to launch hundreds of ballistic missiles in its initial retaliation are even half accurate, then this is an example of the impact of successful interdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limited-setbacks-to-the-nuclear-programme&quot;&gt;Limited Setbacks to the Nuclear Programme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact on Iran’s nuclear programme and implications for Israel’s strategic objective of reducing the threat of a future nuclear-armed Iran are less clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth considering what the last 72 hours have done both to Iran’s technical capabilities as well as to Iran’s political resolve and threat perception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the former, Israel has managed to cause meaningful damage to Iran’s ability to produce fissile material and to other weaponisation-relevant activities by destroying the PFEP, and damaging the UCF and FPFP. The assassination of senior scientists will no doubt also complicate and slow any efforts to reconstitute the programme or to push towards weaponisation. Any impact on existing enriched uranium stocks is unclear. As Iran is estimated to be about a week from being able to enrich sufficient uranium to necessary levels to produce multiple nuclear weapons, destruction of fissile material and Iran’s ability to produce it will be a key to pushing back Tehran’s ability to produce a nuclear weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the attacks have not decisively degraded Iran’s technical ability to weaponise its programme – nor are they likely to. The destruction of the FFEP and the FEP would set the Iranian capabilities and any weaponisation ambitions back even further; yet, the highly advanced state of the programme, including extensive technical expertise (which does not hinge on a small group of senior individuals) means that one can only talk about degrees of degradation and buying time, rather than the full elimination of the programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also unclear whether and what kind of activities Iran may be engaging in at any secret facilities which may be relevant to any weaponisation ambitions and the extent to which these sites are known to – and reachable by – Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the attacks risk having a counterproductive effect when it comes to Iran’s threat perception and its resolve to arm itself with a nuclear weapons capability as the ultimate deterrent. Already, even before the strikes, Iranian leadership was threatening to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT); over the weekend, Iranian legislators put forward draft legislation for NPT withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iranian leadership has also said that it will stop cooperation with the IAEA and curtail the Agency’s access to its programme, though the precise nature of any decrease in engagement with the IAEA is still unclear. NPT withdrawal would most likely result in a complete loss of IAEA visibility on Iran’s nuclear activities. Such a decision to withdraw would be a risky one for Iran – particularly at the moment – as it would risk further attacks by Israel and potentially the US at a time when Iran’s capabilities to defend itself and retaliate have already been degraded. However, in light of the violence of the last few days, Tehran may decide it has little left to lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iran-caught-unprepared-and-weakened&quot;&gt;Iran Caught Unprepared and Weakened&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the initial phases of this war show Iranian failures to plan and adapt, and the hollowness of its military strategy. It would be a mistake to regard Iran as a paper tiger, but it has not adapted to changing circumstances, nor spent time compensating for its conventional vulnerabilities in the same way Israel has over the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel introduced F-35Is in 2016 to improve its ability to penetrate air defences, and introduced the Rampage missile in 2018 to increase its standoff distances from other aircraft. It has been rehearsing long-range operations for years, and augmented its ability to support such attacks with not only long-range tankers but conformal fuel tanks for combat aircraft to extend their range. It is also easy to forget that with Lebanese Hizballah vastly weakened and Assad gone in Syria, the flightpath to Iran has become less complicated and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Iran has seen its position eroded over the past two years. Without proxies to launch weapons in large numbers from multiple angles at relatively short distances, slow-moving Iranian drones and cruise missiles pose a limited threat to Israeli targets 1000km away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves a reliance on ballistic missiles, but whereas Israel has both the intelligence and the weapons to precisely target specific parts of individual buildings, Iran lacks the intelligence and surveillance capabilities to do so. Despite accuracy improvements in newer missiles the bulk of its medium-range ballistic missile arsenal is still comprised of missiles like the Shahab-3, hence it is reduced to area-effect attacks. Iran can pose a significant regional threat, but not one with tactical precision to strike individual targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More directly, Iran has failed to plan or at least adopt crisis measures. Not only was it late to disperse personnel and enact improved security measures, but it also appears to have not dispersed some of its weapons, leading to potentially large numbers of ballistic missiles being destroyed in warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran has no emergency procedures in the face of Israeli air attack – even though it is the most likely form of attack – and so no structured early warning or civilian shelters, even in Tehran. Iran’s strategy has been based on appearing threatening enough to cause damage so as to deter an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s deterrence has also failed, but whereas it is able to then wage a conventional war, Iran appears to have given itself few options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tell-me-how-this-ends&quot;&gt;Tell Me How this Ends&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This operation is not just an attack on the Iranian nuclear programme; it’s a full-blown assault on the pillars of the Iranian security state, and an attempt to destabilise the Iranian regime. We don’t just need to infer this from the target choices: Netanyahu has said as much. It is unclear how brittle the regime is, but the course of the war so far leaves little doubt that Israel can strike most of western Iran and Tehran with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is at this point though, that the uncertainties around the feasibility of the political-military objectives intrude. Much depends on what remains of Iran’s ballistic missile stockpile set against Israeli air defence interceptors. If the former runs out, then Iran has to escalate elsewhere, hunker down and take further punishment, or concede. If the latter occurs, then Israel will start to take hits which could become politically dangerous for the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel appears to be planning continued air strikes, and could be considering further unconventional activity. Tel Aviv has reportedly asked the US to get involved in strikes on the nuclear facility in Fordow, which would deal a significant blow to Iran’s enrichment capacity. Iran’s proxies have been largely silent, but it could still strike other western bases across the region (many less-well defended against air attack), or mine or otherwise seek to close the Strait of Hormuz. But while Iran might hope this would create pressure on Israel to end its strikes, they could just as easily draw the US and others in, as well as seeing Gulf States publicly support action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, such an expansion would pose additional dilemmas. It has personnel at both US and UK facilities across the Middle East, and essentially no ballistic missile defences of its own. It would therefore have to rely on US Patriot batteries, although UK Typhoon aircraft could intercept drones or cruise missiles. Meanwhile, the UK’s minehunters based in Bahrain might be called upon, but would need protection against Iranian fast boats or coastal defence missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operation Rising Lion has started with a series of unambiguous tactical successes. Israel is benefitting from a well-prepared plan, having built and acquired the capabilities to implement it at a time of vulnerability for the Islamic Republic. It is possible that it results in a weakened Iran, with a severely crippled nuclear programme or even a collapse in the regime, and its military execution might be studied for years to come. But such an outcome is by no means assured given the uncertain dynamics inside Iran and the possible interest of President Trump in returning to negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu may be aiming at an ambition which can’t be achieved in the time available through military means. Therefore, it remains open as to whether it provides a definitive answer to the Iranian problem or represents a well-executed delaying action – one which exacerbates Iranian threat perceptions and drive for a nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mozambique faces an array of security challenges, from resilient illicit economies to an enduring kidnapping problem and a long running insurgency in the north. Many security challenges play out at community level, yet local perceptions and experiences of insecurity are underrepresented, with existing evidence based on top-down research privileging established donor and governmental narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on research across Angoche, Maputo, Montepuez, Nacala and Pemba, this report gives voice to bottom-up perspectives. It does so by analysing local-level inputs and lived experience to provide a more holistic appraisal of the security landscape and support more effective interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings depict a multilayered system of local-level insecurity, with lived experience of key harms varying across time and place. Across the board, interviewees expressed an overriding concern with petty crime, street-level insecurity, state abuses and corruption – with terrorism perceived, in all sites but Pemba, as a more peripheral issue. This speaks to a potential discordance with the dominant approach of national and international stakeholders – one perceived by many interviewees as reductionist in its primary focus on countering Islamic fundamentalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the threats playing out at a local level were viewed as interconnected. Notably, endemic corruption was positioned as the foremost factor shaping local political economies, enabling many of the challenges cited, from kidnap-for-ransom to burglary and transnational trafficking flows. Beyond system-wide harms, interviewees described individual risks where entrenched perverse incentives were held to divert officials from public protection mandates. Echoing past studies, the professed result was deep-seated antipathy to state authority and a breakdown of trust between communities and the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dissatisfaction with formal state provision was held to have triggered a search for alternative security structures. Interviewees described experiences of both private security provision and community self-policing initiatives – with a range of legitimacy and access issues raised. At times, these issues were described as themselves fuelling instability and violence, with further negative impacts on citizen security across the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a deeper level, many forms of insecurity experienced at the local level were perceived as expressions of deep-seated, long-term trends. While appearing at times to represent discrete phenomena, these were understood to be shaped by the same enabling environment, as part of a continuum of violence and contestation based on grievances stretching back to Mozambique’s colonial experience. Here, elite capture of the state was presented as a key cross-cutting context of insecurity – with booming international investment, counterposed with entrenched political and economic marginalisation, held to aggravate latent tensions that could be exploited by criminal and insurgent actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the decades, national and international interventions were perceived as having ignored – and at times aggravated – these conditions. International stakeholders were frequently accused of overlooking corrupt behaviour and supporting a flawed security infrastructure, with harmful effects at the local level. Here, a clear sense of community-level exclusion from the design of security interventions was expressed, with a lack of understanding of local dynamics purportedly limiting the effectiveness of external programming and resulting in a range of harmful consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this research, the report presents the following recommendations for those engaged in national and international programming, mindful of the juxtaposition between existing approaches and the experiences of communities on the ground:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;External programming must be designed, adapted and validated based on meaningful local-level consultation that internalises the interests and lived experience of community actors across Mozambique.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Efforts to professionalise law enforcement agencies must have at their core a focus on improving relations with the populations they are mandated to serve.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focused support should be provided to Mozambican civil society groups and NGOs performing potentially crucial roles in monitoring crime prevention and strengthening resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical assistance programming across Mozambique must take politics seriously, with interventions tailored to the political economies of key sectors and institutions at the local and national levels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;International programming must better account for the role of some state actors in the production and maintenance of insecurity in Mozambique, and as potential spoilers in reform efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A focus on the drivers of crime and violence should be prioritised, with programming moving beyond symptoms to address underlying structural dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Opportunities to address the role of local government and support decentralised structures capable of allowing meaningful popular participation should be explored.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regulation and oversight of private security companies should be strengthened to mitigate risks of human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2025, more than 9,000 people in Cabo Delgado, the northernmost province of Mozambique, were displaced due to ongoing violence and insecurity, including attacks by non-state actors in the Macomia and Meluco districts. The situation is one of many acute challenges, including widespread criminality, a longstanding kidnapping problem, and sustained protests following the disputed 2024 general elections, that are indicative of a precarious security situation across the country. With key threats linked to unresolved public grievances and marginalisation, there are growing calls for the government to engage with local communities to establish trust and rapport and to address popular discontent with existing governance and security arrangements. A solid, bottom-up appraisal of the varying local perceptions and experiences of security in Mozambique is required amid these ongoing challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the benefits of “bottom-up” analysis are widely recognised, there is often little in the way of empirical data available, leading to knowledge gaps and an evidence base overly reliant on elite assumptions. Drawing on fieldwork across five locations in Mozambique, this report aims to build an understanding of how security and insecurity, including organised crime and terrorism, are perceived and experienced at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This primarily involves unpacking forms of insecurity as determined by local stakeholders and examining their mechanics, resonance and impact on communities, and how, in some cases, they may be seen to diverge from government and donor priorities. Such insights in turn offer valuable entry points for interrogating the underlying conditions and broader mechanisms that feed into and facilitate violence. Understanding these conditions is crucial: while discrete forms of insecurity have their own (thematically and spatially defined) drivers and dynamics, they often coexist within a shared social ecology, the complexity of which needs to be factored into programme design and policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding how these conditions diminish trust in formal governance, diffuse and normalise violence, and propel social fragmentation is essential for contextualising local experiences of insecurity, identifying plausible pathways of change and developing subsequent intervention strategies. Accordingly, this report examines the following research questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How are crime, terrorism and other forms of insecurity perceived at the local level in Mozambique?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the mechanisms conditioning local insecurity?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the implications for interventions by national stakeholders and international donors?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In examining these questions, the report offers recommendations to governmental stakeholders and donors on how they should adapt their approaches to better address insecurity at the subnational level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Whitehall Report is part of a broader three-year project, “Organised Crime, Terror and Insecurity in Africa” (OCTA), exploring local perceptions of these issues across three case study countries: Kenya, Mozambique and Nigeria. These states all face significant problems linked to crime, terrorism and related security issues; share common challenges in responding to these threats (including limited resources, capacity gaps and corruption); and have been significant recipients of long-term donor assistance and advice on these issues. Across these countries, the project’s contribution is to complement conventional, top-down understandings of insecurity (which generally privilege government and donor perspectives) with “bottom-up” efforts that harness local knowledge, providing a holistic appraisal of the security landscape and contributing to more effective interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This focus is in line with the UN Policy Toolkit on The Hague Good Practices on the Nexus Between Transnational Organized Crime and Terrorism, which acknowledges the need to develop “context-specific responses based on evidence-based research” that draws on local engagement and “inputs from all sectors of society”. Yet concrete initiatives in this area have been few and key knowledge gaps persist, with limited bottom-up engagement to build the evidence base. The project contributes to addressing this gap via in-depth research on insecurity at the local level, considering the findings alongside existing government and donor approaches. It aims to provide guidance to inform policy that is more firmly grounded in analysis of local-level security dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-challenges-and-limitations&quot;&gt;Methodology, Challenges and Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report is based on research conducted between February 2022 and February 2024, which included an in-depth review of open source literature, extensive country-based fieldwork and the use of political economy analysis tools to examine key aspects of the security landscape in Mozambique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors first undertook a rigorous review of open source literature on the security situation in Mozambique to establish a firm contextual basis for both fieldwork and policy analysis. The review covered relevant academic literature, NGO and government reports, policy briefs and media sources. The authors prioritised research on crime, terrorism and other key security threats. A key focus was placed on analysing civil society, government and donors’ understandings of and approaches to these threats. This was supplemented with a review of quantitative data relating to Mozambique, including Worldwide Governance Indicators – Political Stability and the Absence of Violence/Terrorism; Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index; Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) project data; and Afrobarometer surveys on institutions, leadership and governance, among other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers from RUSI then worked with a Mozambican research institution, Centro para Democracia e Direitos Humanos (Centre for Democracy and Human Rights – CDD), to conduct extensive country-based fieldwork, gathering data on local perceptions of insecurity in five urban sites across Mozambique: Angoche, Maputo, Montepuez, Nacala and Pemba. These sites were identified as both offering the best potential to explore the impact of insecurity, and being safe areas in which to conduct research. For example, Pemba and Montepuez, as the provincial capital and second-largest city in the northeastern province of Cabo Delgado, have been impacted by a six-year insurgency. The port cities of Nacala and Angoche in the northern province of Nampula, as well as the capital Maputo in the south, are known hubs for illicit trade and organised criminality, as well as experiencing other pressing security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the country-based research, 98 individuals were interviewed between September and October 2023 (15 in Angoche, 24 in Maputo, 20 in Montepuez, 19 in Nacala and 20 in Pemba). An additional focus group of nine local officials was also held in Angoche. An additional focus group of nine participants was also held in Angoche, where less time was available for interviews as a result of security issues affecting the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees were selected by CDD, using its existing networks and knowledge of the research study sites, from across different communities at the site level and/or based on its knowledge of local patterns of insecurity. In light of the sensitivity of the topic and the potential risks involved, it was agreed with all interviewees that their identities would remain confidential. Interviewees included representatives of NGOs, civil society activists, representatives of community groups, traditional and religious leaders, local officials, law enforcement stakeholders, lawyers, journalists, businesspeople, teaching professionals (schoolteachers and university lecturers) and other key stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RUSI researchers travelled to Maputo in November 2023 to conduct validation workshops with CDD analysts, as well as a further 10 interviews focusing on wider trends in insecurity across the country, with experts on politics and security, and representatives specifically from the business and banking sectors and donor communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EyhV5zb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Interviews and Focus Groups Conducted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers asked a series of open-ended, broadly framed questions to build an accurate picture of local perceptions. Participants were asked to describe the main forms of insecurity within their locality, the type of actors they identified as responsible for insecurity, those they considered to be the main providers of security, and the characteristics of these individuals and groups. During these discussions, interviewers explored the importance that participants attributed to threats such as “crime” and “terrorism”, but particular care was taken to ensure that initial questions did not lead with these terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conducting research across five sites, the project sought to prioritise depth over breadth. Inevitably, the responses will not cover every form and manifestation of local insecurity across a country as large and diverse as Mozambique. However, in combining interview-based research in sites experiencing significant security challenges with in-depth political economy analysis, the project identifies trends and patterns that may also be relevant across other parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report has two chapters and a conclusion. Chapter I disaggregates perceptions and experiences of insecurity as viewed by participants, examining their perceived mechanics, resonance and impact. Chapter II explores a range of underlying factors that help to situate these perceptions of insecurity, assessing how they fit within a wider system of violence and instability, and considering how far existing national and international interventions are viewed as addressing these issues. The conclusion highlights the implications for government and donor policy and programming, and provides recommendations to improve the collective response to localised experiences of insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-local-perceptions-and-experiences-of-insecurity&quot;&gt;I. Local Perceptions and Experiences of Insecurity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In all issues related to conflict or insecurity, communities always lose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;--interview-with-civil-society-activist-pemba&quot;&gt;- Interview with civil-society activist, Pemba&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mozambique faces a range of acute security threats, from high rates of violent crime to an enduring kidnap-for-ransom problem and a long-running insurgency in the country’s northernmost coastal province. Across specific contexts subnationally, perceptions and understandings of these forms of insecurity are contested, at times feeding on a mix of context-specific historical tensions and experiences of inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, it is crucial to interrogate local appraisals of Mozambique’s threat landscape. Accordingly, this chapter examines local-level experiences and perceptions of insecurity in Angoche, Maputo, Montepuez, Nacala and Pemba, drawing on interview and focus group data, and supplemented by analysis of other published information. It analyses the mechanics and perceived impact of key threats, considering their juxtaposition with established donor and governmental narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;street-level-crime-and-personal-insecurity&quot;&gt;Street-Level Crime and Personal Insecurity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across all five sites, among the most common issues raised by interviewees were sustained high levels of crime targeting property and the person. Many recounted direct experiences of victimisation in the form of “petty crime” or street-level insecurity, with muggings, burglary, robbery, pickpocketing and phone-snatching portrayed as routine occurrences. Such patterns of criminal activity are well established and mirrored in past survey-based data. For example, in an Afrobarometer survey of a nationally representative sample of 1,200 adults in October–November 2022, 59% of respondents reported feeling unsafe while walking in their neighbourhood at least once in the previous year, with 39% reporting feeling unsafe “several times”, “many times” or “always”. These survey results represented an increase on those a decade earlier, with the proportion of respondents reporting feeling unsafe in their communities “several times” increasing by 12 percentage points since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although pronounced in high-density urban areas, criminal activity of this kind was reported across all five sites. Hotspots were described as relatively transient – shifting as a function of a range of factors, including law enforcement activity. The distribution of target populations was also reported as relevant in many cases. Here, those of greatest means were at times perceived to be more frequently targeted. Reinforcing this, a number of (albeit dated) studies on the socio-economic determinants of individual and household level victimisation in Mozambique have found the probability of victimisation in property crimes and various kinds of physical assault to increase commensurate with income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on countrywide representative household surveys, the significance of this effect was found to vary by crime type, while across the board, poorer households – although less likely to be targeted – were found to suffer relatively greater losses when such incidents occur. Some interviewees commented on the deterrent effect of additional protective security measures. As one respondent in Nacala observed, where “wealthy individuals can afford private security, … middle-class families become the primary victims”. Meanwhile, other research points to the vulnerability to violent crime of inhabitants of low-income neighbourhoods, often linked to a lack of state presence in such peripheral locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While low levels of reporting, a lack of standardisation in collection systems and inconsistent record-keeping affect the reliability of official crime data, petty criminality was depicted as pervasive across interview testimony. In many cases, severe disruption to residents’ day-to-day lives was reported. Those interviewed in Maputo, for example, spoke of high levels of vulnerability spanning a wide array of crimes against property and the person. In the words of one civil society activist, “In the city, you can easily become a victim of carjacking, robbery or assault. Incidents like having … a mobile phone stolen are common in downtown Maputo”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other interviewees described the cumulative effect of these patterns of criminality. In the words of one respondent, “It’s difficult to refer to ‘security’ in a city where individuals are abducted nearly every week; where you can’t walk safely due to the constant threat of robbery or even murder; where your mobile can be snatched at any given moment; and where your car can be vandalised for parts or outright stolen”. Street-level theft of mobile phones, car parts and motorcycles was also reported as pervasive by respondents in Angoche, Montepuez, Pemba and Nacala, with further concern expressed over high rates of home invasions, and burglaries targeting residences and workplaces in these locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police response to these crimes was consistently described as inadequate. Despite a recent increase in police presence and visibility in Maputo bairros (neighbourhoods), including in those bairros which are experiencing high levels of crime, respondents frequently described themselves as underserved by the police and other security agencies, with some bemoaning a lack of police patrols, stations and other security infrastructure in key locations. Others complained that police are slow to respond to calls and, when they do, are slow or unable to act. They blamed this on resource constraints (particularly a lack of vehicles or fuel), as well as institutionalised corruption, as explored further below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The violent nature of some street-level criminality stands out in interview testimony. In Montepuez, respondents spoke of machete-wielding men targeting both wealthy and poorer individuals (such as kiosk owners), while accounts of the use of cords across roads to bring down motorcyclists and assaults conducted using hammers speak similarly to the potential level of physical threat to victims. As noted by one respondent in Maputo: “Nowadays, people are killed in broad daylight – just for holding a simple mobile phone, one might lose one’s life”. Yet interviewees rarely oriented their accounts explicitly around the individual physical (or emotional) harm inflicted. Instead, accounts generally focused on the transactional nature of these incidents and the material losses involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, street-level crime was described as unsophisticated, disorganised and opportunistic. As noted by one interviewee in Maputo: “Increasing poverty in major cities, particularly in Maputo, has resulted in more opportunistic crimes … such as cell phone theft, which can escalate to deadly outcomes”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others cited high demand for car parts as driving opportunistic instances of carjacking and theft amidst an unregulated market for vehicles. In the words of one respondent in Nacala, rather than “structured or organised groups with leadership”, those responsible are often “poor youths … spontaneously coming together to commit crime”. Others spoke of unsophisticated crime, but with a degree of organisation; in Montepuez, interviewees referenced “organised groups of young people” committing robbery and theft with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differences in the perceived prevalence of such incidents emerged across the different sites. Notably, Angoche was the only site where any (albeit few) respondents reported feeling safe on a day-to-day basis. Some interviewees attributed this to relatively tight community links and the city’s relative geographical isolation, which limits inbound and outbound population flows. Despite this, other Angoche-based respondents reported that crime was widespread, revealing a marked divergence in perceptions in this location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other sites there was consensus on the pervasive nature of street-level crime. Other distinguishing features were apparent, however, that marked out particular locations. For example, a distinctive characteristic in sites in Cabo Delgado was the way in which respondents wove accounts of petty crime into broader discussions of insecurity, linking these to experiences of terrorism, transnational crime, corruption and state predation. These links are examined further in Chapter II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Maputo, depictions of street-level criminality often focused on the dynamics of kidnap for ransom as perceived by interviewees. Here, far from the politically motivated abductions witnessed during Mozambique’s 1977–92 civil war, contemporary kidnapping incidents were identified as criminally motivated, affecting ground-level security in different ways. It is assessed that these incidents predominantly affect businesspeople of Asian descent and their families, as well as other nationals with a presence in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees reflected regularly on the nature of the law enforcement response. While under-reporting makes it difficult to establish accurate kidnapping rates, in March 2024, Minister of Interior Pascoal Ronda announced that the Police of the Republic of Mozambique (PRM) had recorded 185 cases of kidnapping since 2011, with more than 288 people detained on suspicion of involvement. In general, levels of kidnapping are regarded as high by southern African (and wider continental) standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changing nature of this phenomenon was articulated in interview testimony and has been laid out in the published literature. Previously linked to criminal networks within relevant Asian communities, kidnap for ransom is perceived as lucrative and low risk and has increasingly raised concern. Growing sophistication of the criminal networks has also been observed. As noted by one interviewee: “Over the past 10 years, we have witnessed the strengthening of groups involved in kidnappings”. These groups were described by others as “notable crime syndicates”, holders of “economic power” and “behind not only kidnappings but also other threats from fraud to robberies”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These views are in line with other sources. As noted by corporate intelligence consultancy S-RM, kidnappings should be viewed as more than simply “a consequence of the petty criminality associated with Mozambique’s struggling economy and increasing poverty levels”. Instead, the phenomenon is held to “reflect … broader concerns with the country’s political leadership and weak security apparatus, which has produced an environment conducive to the proliferation of organised crime”. Frequently marked by violence and tight coordination, many kidnapping cases are reported to be well-planned operations, with targets’ activities reconnoîtred in advance and, in some cases, prospective victims extorted to avoid being victimised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees spoke of collusion among state officials as key to these operations, describing some police officers as “paid operatives” of kidnapping syndicates – complicit in facilitating criminally motivated kidnapping events and protecting perpetrators. At times, respondents held that compromised police officers sabotaged cases to avoid implicating senior officials. Such views come in the wake of past cases involving officials across the state apparatus (albeit with prosecutions being a rare occurrence). Past research by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC), among other institutions, similarly points to wide-ranging state involvement, from the supply of weapons to direct participation in abductions. Key governmental actors have recognised the extent of collusion in a range of instances: as warned by former Attorney-General Augusto Paulino, kidnappings “will not cease while there is no purification of our own ranks, while we do not eliminate those who have been infiltrated into the judicial system”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the kidnapping threat has terrorised Mozambique’s business community, its impact on other constituencies was also highlighted. Beyond local businesspeople, other interviewees expressed concern over criminally motivated kidnappings, including of teachers, journalists and civil society activists, among other stakeholders. As observed by one respondent: “Kidnapping may seem to affect a limited community, but its effects are felt throughout society”. This sentiment is mirrored in long-running public protests, reflecting sustained societal outrage at the government’s failure to respond. At times, the situation has made international headlines, as with the abduction and murder of a 13-year-old boy in 2013, triggering marches by thousands of protestors in Maputo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public anger appears to centre on impunity as a common thread across successive kidnappings and associated retributive events. Interviewees lamented the contribution made to a wider climate of fear and insecurity, to the normalisation of a lack of respect for the rule of law, and to the hollowing out of criminal justice institutions. In the words of a Maputo-based respondent: “When you have police officers participating in kidnappings for personal gain, it epitomises the dark side of corruption”. Resentment appears to be heightened where high-level actors are found to be complicit, as seen in the sentencing in 2013 of a member of the presidential guard, alongside five others. That year, former first lady Graç a Machel described all of Mozambican society as “held hostage to the kidnappers”, a sentiment articulated by interviewees over 10 years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;state-predation-and-corruption&quot;&gt;State Predation and Corruption&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports of complicity among officials were provided not only in relation to kidnapping. In all sites, interviewees perceived abuse of power and corruption within state security institutions as a core feature of the security landscape. Almost all described corruption as endemic, with the influence of corrupt relationships articulated as the defining feature of the country’s governance and the foremost factor shaping local political economies. Such attitudes are entrenched in a long history: accusations of corruption and other serious violations have plagued Mozambique’s domestic security institutions for decades, from the country’s police to its wildlife services and military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees alleged a wide range of predatory behaviours among state actors. Reference was made most frequently to extortion and bribery on the part of the police, against which antipathy was often levelled. This institutional focus is understandable: as the closest government authority to local communities, and given its mandate to maintain public safety, the police are often the first point of contact for citizens experiencing security threats and harms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range of respondents expressed the view that some police officers patrol or investigate crime only in exchange for bribes. Others provided accounts of extortion: in a typical account, one social activist described instances where officials “stop citizens during the night to intimidate them”, noting, “I have personally experienced situations [such as one] where 10 intoxicated individuals with only … [their] identification cards stopped me [for no legitimate reason, to extort money]”. Other accounts were provided of officers extorting money at road blocks and police stations, reportedly demanding pay-offs from citizens accused of minor illegal activity (such as gambling), or “shaking down” individuals directly for money or possessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accounts provided are consistent with perceptions revealed in recent survey data. An Afrobarometer survey of 1,200 adults in October–November 2022 saw 51% of those requesting assistance from the police in the previous year reporting having to pay a bribe, with 47% reporting doing so when encountering police in other situations (at checkpoints, during ID checks and in the course of investigations). Over half (55%) of those surveyed described “most” or “all” police officers as corrupt – a higher proportion than for any of the other 10 institutions covered by the survey. In terms of behaviours, police were perceived to “often” or “always” stop drivers without a sound reason by 45% of respondents, to engage in criminal activity by 39%, and to use excessive force against suspected criminals and protestors by 37% and 34%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not disaggregated by institution, this comes against the backdrop of Mozambique’s stagnating position on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index. In 2023, the country was ranked 145 out of 180 countries surveyed, with a score of 25/100, a progressive decline from its ranking of 123 (of 176 countries surveyed) in 2012, with a score of 31/100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some interviewees reflected on the incentive structures at play. Low pay and morale were frequently assessed to be enhancing police officers’ susceptibility to bribery – in the words of one respondent, “what drives them [police officers] is the profit they’ll make at the end of the day, not the safety of people and their property”. Here, interviewees pointed to discrepancies between low salaries and the cars and property reportedly owned by some police and customs officers, with well-off “businessmen” held routinely to “offer luxury vehicles to police chiefs in exchange for protection”. It was often held that these “businessmen” had come to the local area from abroad. As summarised by one respondent: “Foreigners … dominate commerce in Nacala. With the money they have, they can secure police protection. It’s frustrating – we are in our own land but don’t have protection. It feels like we are the enemies of the police.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees pointed to further perceived links between police and other criminally motivated individuals. At the far end of the spectrum, in Nacala accounts were provided of links to serious crime, with respondents in Maputo also speaking of an active perceived role by police units in kidnapping and burglary. The impact on communities were described as encompassing an erosion of the rule of law, while a damaging effect in terms of deterrence was also reported. As expressed by one interviewee: “Where police are bought to work in favour of the criminal, this neutralises the preventive and combative functions of the state. Corruption is like a poison; once it stings, the organs die. Thus, the state’s organs die, allowing organised crime to prosper.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond system-wide harms attributed to police corruption, individual risks were also described. A number of interviewees articulated the view that reporting a crime came with a risk that information would be passed to the criminals responsible, who would then engage in targeted intimidation. Others complained that citizens who refused to pay off police risked being targeted by both criminals and the police themselves. As expressed by one respondent in Maputo, “If something happens to me and I turn to the police, I’m uncertain whether I’m in safe hands”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruption risks across the wider criminal justice system were also reported. Interviewees lamented an entrenched culture of impunity, readily exploited by criminal actors. Corruption risks were identified from the early stages of the criminal justice chain, with public officials perceived to engage in a range of behaviours for bribes, including releasing suspects, obstructing investigations and destroying evidence or otherwise ensuring its inadmissibility. Similar concerns were expressed further along the criminal justice chain, with compromised officers across prosecution and judicial services perceived to jeopardise cases in many different ways, from falsification of evidence to intimidation of witnesses and delaying of due process. These views echo previous survey data, with 31% of those surveyed by Afrobarometer in October–November 2022 describing “most” or “all” judges and magistrates as corrupt, and a further 42% judging “some” of these professionals to be corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, interviewees spoke of the dual nature of citizen exploitation enabled by a compromised criminal justice system, describing corrupt officials as leveraging both sides in a criminal case. For one respondent, “if you commit a crime and seek resolution, you have to bribe [while] … simultaneously, the victim is charged to expedite their case”. The perversion of the system that this entails was outlined, with interviewees describing patterns of prosecution determined by the ability to make corrupt payments, rather than a disinterested application of the law. In such cases, one interviewee perceived, “the person who is in the right might not see their rights upheld”, with officers focusing “their attention on scrutinising honest individuals while facilitating criminals in return for bribes”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While bribery and corruption were the primary forms of misconduct alleged, others spoke of misuse of force, sometimes with deadly outcomes. At times, these behaviours were depicted as intertwined, with requests for bribes linked to the threat and use of force. In other cases, interviewees pointed to police violence at public demonstrations. As expressed by one respondent in Pemba, “the PRM violate citizens’ human rights through the use of rubber bullets, mock executions, tear gas, and unwarranted arrests when they take to the streets to protest or express discontent with the regime”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such incidents have been condemned internationally. In the case of a lethal police response to protests following local elections in October 2023, Amnesty International equated the “use of excessive force by the PRM, which resulted in deaths, serious injuries and the arbitrary detention of protesters and bystanders” to “clear violations of the country’s Constitution and international human rights obligations”. Most recently, protests over the disputed 2024 general election triggered unrest, a violent security force response (condemned by Human Rights Watch), the violent intimidation of opposition party members, the detention of journalists and a reported 250+ fatalities – with the government resorting to banning protests, condemning these protests as “acts of subversion” and “terrorism”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In interview sites in Cabo Delgado, respondents reported human rights violations in the context of a militarised counterinsurgency response. Here, a range of predatory behaviours were alleged, with “officers of the FDS [Mozambican Defense and Security Forces], municipal police, local or community force” referenced simultaneously as “providers of security” and “agents of insecurity”. As described by one respondent in Montepuez, “the community fears the military during patrols – they are known for their impatience and intolerance”. At times, human rights abuses and a lack of trust in authorities were perceived as drivers of the conflict itself. This is documented across the published literature, with the pursuit of a “military-first” strategy to tackling violent extremism identified as alienating communities and aggravating underlying grievances in a range of cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local discontent over both state and private sector activity here predates the insurgency. For example, allegations of human rights violations and excessive use of force against artisanal miners were levelled at security forces around the Montepuez Ruby Mining concession from 2012, with part-owner Gemfields paying compensation of $7.6 million to 273 artisanal miners and villagers in 2019 (albeit without admitting liability). In 2021, Amnesty International accused not only insurgents but also government forces and private security company Dyck Advisory Group of war crimes, noting that “the security forces of Mozambique have abused the very people they are meant to protect”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mindful of these issues, various frameworks have been enacted to guide security relationships between extractive companies, state and non-state security actors, and communities. The government has indicated its intention, for example, to draw on the Voluntary Principles (VPs) on Security and Human Rights as a multistakeholder membership-based initiative, with a number of companies using these principles in practice. As recognised by researchers Christopher Vandome and Alex Vines, however, adherence to the VPs is not sufficient and needs to be “matched by a wider national, government-led effort to improve the human rights environment”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Echoing past studies, interview testimony indicates that this situation has translated into a deep-seated distrust of state authority. In the words of one respondent in Pemba, “there is a breakdown of trust between communities and those who should ensure their security – the state itself”. In day-to-day encounters, this was positioned as challenging the very notion of policing by consent. As expressed by a Nacala-based respondent: “The state has lost legitimacy in the eyes of communities … our police officers are not well trained … they address citizens without civility, professionalism, or ethics – how can communities respect and acknowledge their legitimacy?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that perceptions of corruption and state abuses across the five sites were not homogenous nor consistently held – nor could they be independently verified. While the critiques of domestic security provision mentioned above were articulated by a significant majority of interviewees, some provided more positive evaluations of state security activity. A number of individuals in Angoche and Montepuez credited the police with detaining thieves, active patrolling and maintaining constructive community relationships, while also highlighting extortion and bribery as entrenched problems. Positive accounts, however, represent a minority of views expressed, with the overall picture emerging from interviewee testimony being one of dissatisfaction and mistrust of a state security apparatus viewed as preying on the people it is mandated to serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beyond-state-responses-private-security-and-vigilantism&quot;&gt;Beyond State Responses: Private Security and Vigilantism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst this perceived public sector ineffectiveness, interviewees touched on a variety of non-state responses. Most prominently, interviewees pointed to growing use of private security services, with rising demand for effective security solutions among Mozambican households and businesses presenting lucrative opportunities for private companies. In the country’s north, expanding natural resource exploitation has also seen extractive and other companies employ growing numbers of private security actors, targeting gaps in public provision amid an unstable threat landscape. Rising use of private security, however, raised various issues for interviewees, often depicted as a symptom of deep-seated inequalities and a lack of economic opportunity for average Mozambicans. Many denounced private security as the preserve of the wealthy, with resentment expressed and moral quandaries raised regarding those who are unable to afford these services and are left to live with insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of interviewees pointed to cracks across this fractured security architecture, citing perceived deficiencies in both public and private services. They noted that “public security agents may violate human rights, while private forces are more concerned with profit”. Intersections between public and private security were also raised as an issue in some cases. In the words of one respondent in Pemba: “Many companies operating in the city, due to the evident weaknesses of our public … security forces, end up hiring private security firms. However, a concerning factor is that these private firms are often owned by the higher-ups in the police or military, … contributing to the lack of improvement in public security conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concern was expressed over alleged predatory behaviour on the part of private security actors. This reflects wider reported anxiety among civil society over the capacity of the Mozambican government to regulate private security companies. As noted by Adriano Nuvunga of CDD, “These companies have capabilities that often exceed those of the Mozambican state … We are concerned about the limited capacity … to monitor and inspect effectively the private security companies. Due to weak monitoring capacity, human rights violations by private security companies are common.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This points to fundamental questions around democratic oversight. As noted by analyst Anna Marie Burdzy, “the provision of [private] security services, inherently, includes a possible need to use force … However, using force bears the risk of abuses and misconduct.” Burdzy also notes that “certain tasks which are [traditionally] restricted to law enforcement [are ones] … for which private security [services are] generally not adequately trained. As a result, PSCs [private security companies] may handle such situations in ways that escalate rather than de-escalate the situation.” Echoing such concerns, interviewees perceived the governance issues surrounding such a fundamental shift in security provision to have received insufficient attention. As argued by one respondent in Pemba: “Security is too sensitive an issue to be entrusted to entities outside the state” and the government “should not privatise or outsource security”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees also pointed to other non-state responses. With a significant proportion of the population unable to access private security, these were depicted, at their core, as efforts by community members to take security into their own hands. Here, interviewees described cases of community involvement in lynching, vigilantism and mob violence against perpetrators of criminal activity. Such accounts were particularly prevalent in Nacala, although details on what activities lynching comprised were not offered. One respondent in Maputo gave some indication, with residents of one locality reportedly warning: “Do not rob [neighbourhood] T3 or they will burn you with a tyre”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such incidents have long been reported by other sources. Back in 2008, the US State Department warned that lynchings and vigilantism were tarnishing Mozambique’s human rights record, citing 26 instances of vigilante killings in Maputo, Matola and Beira. Specific manifestations of local-level vigilante justice have also been reported in the context of the insurgency. In December 2018, for example, an “improvised village militia” comprising residents of Nangade district was reported in the media to have launched a counterattack on insurgents to protect their community. As reported at the time: “Armed with knives, axes, hoes and similar weapons, the group captured two men believed to be insurgents … [but] instead of handing them over to the police, they decided to execute them on the spot. They were beheaded, in retaliation against the decapitations carried out by the Islamists”. In April 2023, local militias (força local) were granted legal authority by the government to help combat the insurgency, despite international concern over the move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the country more broadly, while a deeply rooted community-level justice system exists, a resort to lynchings in particular was attributed by interviewees to a loss of ground-level confidence in official structures. This was articulated by some interviewees in emotional terms – as an expression of mounting public anger at perceived public service failings. As noted by a Nacala-based respondent: “When the community decides to take to the streets, everyone from children to the elderly comes out to ensure security, and they achieve results. When they find a thief, they don’t take them to the police because they believe the thief will be protected … [they] lynch the thief [instead].”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At other times, community responses were described as less impulsive and better organised, amounting to structured systems of local-level protection. They were described as such in the context of a wider tradition of legal pluralism as recognised in the country’s constitution, with many citizens seeking redress through customary and community-based institutions and mechanisms of justice and policing. As articulated by one interviewee in Nacala: “In some neighbourhoods, we have community policing groups: local volunteers who patrol during the night”. These efforts were described as effective in some cases, but as coming at a financial cost. The respondent continued: “In areas [patrolled by community policing groups] … there has been a reduction in home invasions and public attacks at night. However, each family must contribute 500 meticais per month to pay those who patrol the neighbourhoods.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, local-level responses were described as escalating beyond compensatory security provision to encompass retaliatory violence against police officers and infrastructure. This was pronounced in interview testimony in Nacala. In the words of one resident: “The relationship between the police and the communities is not good – in neighbourhoods like Quissimajulo and Janga, there have been clashes between the police and the local population”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interviewee described Nacala as a “dangerous zone for the police. … When the population feels that the police are not solving their problems, they start to act out”, continuing: “There are always riots and people destroy police stations … The police have gone to the extent of removing a police station from a neighbourhood, and the district government temporarily closed a health centre.” Police stations were again targeted and vandalised in unrest surrounding the contestation of election results in 2024 (alongside prisons and medical facilities). Against this backdrop, the state was described as “losing credibility”, with instances recounted of police officers killed in clashes with residents. Implications for senior officers were also described: “Nacala is known as the district where police commanders don’t last long”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;terrorism-and-conflict-in-cabo-delgado&quot;&gt;Terrorism and Conflict in Cabo Delgado&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their perceived prevalence, in recent years the threats described above have not commonly been prioritised in top-level national and international discourse on the security situation in Mozambique. Instead, over much of the past decade violent extremism in Cabo Delgado has routinely been framed as the dominant feature of the security landscape and the core driver of instability in the country, likely due to the wider potential implications of this threat. Referring to the actions of the extremist group known locally as Al-Shabaab (though unrelated to Al-Shabaab in Somalia), insurgent violence in the country’s poorest region has a long history: the rise of today’s insurgency can be traced back to Mozambique’s war of independence, with the beginning of Frelimo’s attacks against Portuguese positions in Cabo Delgado launched from across the country’s northern border with Tanzania. Yet, rightly or wrongly, the prominence of violent extremism in state and donor narratives may be increasingly out of sync with local-level perceptions of “lived insecurity”. Articulating this view, some interviewees argued that a singular counterterrorism focus risks coming at the cost of concerted action to address more immediate community concerns in a range of locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief overview of the violent extremist landscape in Cabo Delgado is required before respondents’ perceptions of the attendant security threats are examined. The start of the insurgency is generally attributed to a string of attacks on police stations in the port town of Mocímboa da Praia in October 2017. This came in the wake of reports of repeated clashes between youth gangs and religious authorities in Mocímboa da Praia in the preceding years – with the violence attributed by the Mozambican government mainly to foreign destabilisation efforts. By 2021, a group known locally as Al-Shabaab (“the youth”) had grown in capability to the point of having dealt major blows to Mozambique’s military. While foreign fighters appear among Al-Shabaab’s fighting force, Mozambicans make up the majority of this force, which remains Mozambican-led.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group appears to have developed as a small sect espousing a brand of fundamentalist Islam and anti-authority ideology at odds with the approach of established local Muslim organisations. While it initially issued few public messages, the announcement of formal affiliation with the Islamic State in 2018 drew international attention. The Mozambican group’s leaders subsequently stated its objectives – to establish an Islamic state and ensure the application of Sharia law – while shifting the group’s focus from primarily targeting security forces to widespread attacks on civilians. From 2017 to 2021, the conflict resulted in 3,000 civilian deaths and the displacement of close to 1 million people, with towns and villages burned and whole communities forced to flee. And despite losing ground in the face of military interventions, the group has demonstrated an ongoing ability to inflict damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s principal response was to launch a large-scale counterinsurgency operation. This is widely viewed to have been ineffective, failing to quell Al-Shabaab activity. The heavy-handed response has also had damaging effects, with security forces destroying mosques and killing civilians, harming relations with local communities. From late 2019, the government turned to private military companies for help, including the Wagner Group and South African Dyck Advisory Group, but the impact on the insurgency appears to have been limited. By 2020, Al-Shabaab controlled a significant number of villages and towns, was active beyond Cabo Delgado in neighbouring Niassa and Nampula provinces, and in March 2021 made international headlines by seizing the northern town of Palma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palma is in close proximity to major gas fields, and the attack on the town was widely viewed as a turning point in the conflict. The incident put pressure on the government to accept foreign assistance. In 2021, 1,000 soldiers from Rwanda and 2,000 troops comprising a newly formed Southern African Development Community (SADC) Mission in Mozambique were deployed, with numbers subsequently fluctuating. These interventions are credited with having curtailed Al-Shabaab’s influence, isolating the insurgents to remote bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the insurgency has not been defeated. Throughout 2022, Al-Shabaab undertook hit-and-run attacks, mainly against undefended villages and isolated military outposts. In 2023, there was a reported drop-off in violence, alongside unconfirmed reports of a shift in tactics to reduce civilian casualties and present the group as an alternative political authority to the Mozambican state. It has been observed, however, that this is more likely to be attributable to counterinsurgency operations and declining manpower, while doubts have emerged over the resilience of the group’s ties with the Islamic State. Despite this, Al-Shabaab remains a threat, capable – as seen in the Macomia district – of launching deadly attacks on military positions and laying siege to villages and towns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, interviewee perceptions of the threat posed varied. Outside Pemba, violent extremism featured comparatively less often in discussions of insecurity than the other threats covered in this chapter. When raised, the threat was usually covered in cursory detail in terms of those involved or their agendas. On two occasions, respondents identified “Al-Shabab” and “Islamist terrorists” as threat actors, but generally they referred simply to “terrorists”. Revealing a particular understanding of the nature of the threat, rooted as this is in a Muslim-majority province, respondents regularly articulated the view that there was “no connection” between “religion” or “Islam” and terrorism in terms of the impact it has on Mozambique. A religious leader in Angoche described the insurgents simply as “people who hide behind religion” in pursuit of other goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Maputo, “terrorism” was mentioned just once in interviews. This is perhaps unsurprising given the physical distance between the capital and the insurgents’ area of operations. In Nacala, Angoche and Montepuez, some participants expressed fear in relation to the threat of terrorism, yet more often, respondents did not point to terrorism as posing a significant direct threat to themselves, their communities or their daily lives. Nor did they view this as more than a hypothetical risk in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Pemba, fear of terrorism appeared more proximate. This is illustrated by such comments as: “I get the impression that terrorists are in every district” and “I am afraid because I can’t tell if someone is a terrorist”. Interviewees in Pemba also reported a significant deterioration in security with the rise of the insurgency. Yet they did not attribute this to the terrorist threat alone. Instead, it was linked to a mix of interconnected factors, from popular opposition to violence suffered at the hands of security forces deployed to counter the insurgency, to the movement of large numbers of displaced people, and routine instances of corruption undermining the counterterrorism response. On the latter point, allegations were made of security officers supplying terrorists with food and arms and releasing suspected insurgents for bribes. One respondent in Pemba observed: “I see the police and military as key players [in fuelling instability] – instead of ensuring security, they become perpetrators of insecurity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Montepuez, some individuals similarly perceived corruption within security forces as bolstering the insurgency. Here, respondents also outlined a fear that facilities for displaced persons might be used to harbour terrorists. The latter perspective forms part of a broader theme across sites, whereby “outsiders” and “foreigners” are viewed as amplifying security issues. At times, terrorist threats were attributed wholly to extra-territorial actors: one religious leader in Angoche proffered the view: “Terrorism didn’t start in our country; it is an act that migrated to our land”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A distinguishing feature in Nacala, meanwhile, was the focus on recruitment in interview testimony. Respondents described the narratives used to convince local youths to travel north – often centring on job opportunities across Cabo Delgado’s fishing industry. These narratives were commonly held to be based on empty promises: in the words of one respondent, “The police have returned many youths to Nacala who claimed they were going to fish in Cabo Delgado … some leave with job promises but encounter a different reality”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such cases, recruits were held to be motivated by unemployment; in others, wider factors were cited. As expressed by one respondent in Nacala, “recruitment is not solely due to the economic vulnerability of the young – recruiters use money and religion, claiming they are fighting the Frelimo government in the name of Allah”. Yet the legitimacy of these religious narratives was questioned: for another Nacala-based respondent, “What’s happening in Cabo Delgado has nothing to do with Islam”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Angoche, a connection was made to natural resources. With the Cabo Delgado insurgency perceived to be driven by discontent over exploitation of large-scale natural gas reserves, respondents in Angoche expressed fears that the same might occur in their region. This comes alongside a growing focus on the hydrocarbon potential of the Angoche basin, and moves in 2024 to grant petroleum exploration and production concession contracts to exploit this. As observed by one Angoche-based respondent: “People believe that terrorism in Cabo Delgado is due to gas exploration taking place there – when similar exploration was announced in Angoche, locals started fearing its arrival”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often these concerns were linked to the dominance of natural resource extraction economies by foreign entities. Interviewees lamented the lack of local employment opportunities created, with significant ground-level resentment cited where riches are perceived to accrue to an unaccountable elite. Such a discrepancy in the benefit derived from major extractive projects has been identified as a driver of conflict in Cabo Delgado across the published literature. This was reiterated by a traditional leader interviewed in Angoche, who said, “I believe the substantial investments in hydrocarbons create envy. … When we see our ecosystem being destroyed, which used to sustain us, by foreigners, we start questioning. And because we lack training, we are nothing in this world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;illicit-economies-and-organised-criminality&quot;&gt;Illicit Economies and Organised Criminality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees often framed a deterioration in security with the rise of the insurgency as part of a wider picture of fluctuating instability. Many did not attribute instability to the terrorist threat alone, citing a range of interconnected factors as influencing the broader security landscape. Beyond entrenched street-level insecurity, corruption and human rights abuses, a further set of threats cited by interviewees in this context were illicit economies and organised crime – described as key sources of ground-level insecurity in a range of sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A civil society activist interviewed in Pemba perceived a growth in opportunities for organised crime with the rise of the insurgency in Cabo Delgado. They did so noting: “In addition to terrorism that began in 2017, … other types of crimes … including … drug trafficking, corruption, and organised crime … have become more prevalent … due to the conducive environment created by terror activities”. This points to a perception of causality whereby the insurgency is viewed to have established the context for organised criminal activity to thrive. Others perceived the situation differently; in the words of another respondent in Pemba, “we still face older crimes that have always been prevalent in Cabo Delgado province, such as smuggling of timber and precious stones”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other interview sites, organised crime was similarly described without reference to the insurgency. The principal dynamic cited was transnational drug trafficking – a particular concern among respondents in Angoche, Nacala and Pemba. Trafficking in people, timber, precious stones, marine and other natural resources were mentioned, but less frequently than drugs. The vulnerability of the country to illicit flows in all these commodities is detailed across the published literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees most commonly cited heroin and cocaine as concerns, as well as suruma (the local term for cannabis). While Cabo Delgado and Nampula provinces were perceived as “corridors” for large-scale transnational drug trafficking, descriptions of localised drug abuse were also proffered. In some cases, localised drug use was viewed as a consequence of transnational drug flows, and a driver of other threats. In Pemba, young people were described as “plagued by drug use and unemployment” and engaged in systematic “theft … to feed their addictions”. The public health implications of such localised consumer markets are documented across the literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Pemba, interviewees expressed similar concerns in Nacala and Angoche. This aligns with shifts in illicit drug flows identified by external analysts. In 2022, for example, GITOC pointed to a southwards movement in the Mozambican drop-off points used for heroin moving from the Makran coast of Iran and Pakistan en route to consumer markets in South Africa and Europe. Whereas Pemba previously served as the southernmost offload point, a desire to avoid potential insurgency-related supply-line disruption has reportedly seen growing use of landing points in Nampula and Zambezia provinces. Today, drug flows via Nacala and Angoche are widely documented, while GITOC analysis points to an absence of evidence of established links between the insurgency and transnational drug trafficking. This is despite public statements by Mozambican and regional forces pointing to insurgent involvement in this and other criminal markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar uncertainty over the interface between terrorism and organised criminality was expressed by many respondents. Some pointed to the imperative of adequate financing to sustain terrorist operations, citing organised crime as a likely funding stream. Others referenced the level of weaponry and equipment held by insurgents, pointing to potential links with arms trafficking flows. In further accounts, the conceptual separation between terrorism and organised crime was probed. One interviewee described the two phenomena as one and the same: “I don’t see a clear boundary between these concepts as one implies the other. If violent extremism exists, it’s a form of crime.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times, respondents pointed to similarities in the underlying conditions fuelling both phenomena. At a local level, lack of opportunity was described as driving both crime and terrorism, while the perceived role of outsiders was also stressed. In Angoche, frequent reference was made to the city’s coastal location as a source of vulnerability. As one respondent noted: “our coast … can serve as an entry point for individuals linked to terrorist acts. Some say this is linked to drug trafficking, for which our area is a transit channel”. As expressed by another interviewee, “Angoche … is located on the coast, where most violent crimes in Southern Africa occur. … Angoche, with its many islands, … has also been seen as a provider of recruits for terrorists in Cabo Delgado, contributing to … insecurity affecting not only the district but also the province and the whole country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees often viewed corruption as an enabler of organised crime, with compromised officers within police, military and customs authorities perceived to be facilitating drug and other illicit flows. Drug traffickers working via the Port of Nacala were described as so “sophisticated” and “powerful”, that “if a customs officer finds drugs in their goods, they will not report it for fear of retaliation”. Beyond facilitation, direct involvement by customs and police officers was reported by interviewees in Nacala. As alleged by one respondent, “The tax haven [enabling transnational organised crime] starts at the Port of Nacala and extends to the Ministry of the Interior”. As perceived similarly in Pemba, organised crime “is always linked to a power holder, be they community-based, economic or political”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a purely domestic level, organised crime was also referenced in relation to some dimensions of street-level insecurity, where a spectrum ranging from ad hoc to organised was described. At the less sophisticated end of the scale was spontaneous criminality involving under-employed youth with few job prospects – held by some to be perpetrated by “groups of criminals that form randomly, without structure or organisation”. Toward the other end of the spectrum, muggings, burglary, robbery and car-jackings were at times described as organised and premeditated, conducted by structured groups of individuals. While these groups were generally not named, in Nacala some respondents spoke of an organised entity labelled “Group 15”. The research team was unable to find external analysis or reference to “Group 15”, but interviewees described it as “well organised”, “having leadership” and selecting its victims strategically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across all threats, a final note should be made of the lack of confidence expressed by some interviewees in their knowledge base. Some lamented a perceived lack of transparency on the part of the government in relation to illicit markets and insurgent and counter-insurgent operations. Others stressed their inability to answer certain questions, expressing awareness of knowledge gaps on the threats plaguing their everyday lives. As a businessperson interviewed in Angoche stated, “I can’t precisely explain the state of security provided by the government; as a population, we are in the dark”. These sentiments were often expressed alongside a deeply felt sense of resignation to the fact that many households, and indeed whole communities, ultimately feel left to provide for their own security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-contexts-and-wider-systems-of-violence&quot;&gt;II. Contexts and Wider Systems of Violence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The biggest mistake analysts make is viewing insecurity as an isolated issue. We must look deeper into the root causes … leading individuals to create problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;--interview-with-traditional-leader-pemba&quot;&gt;- Interview with traditional leader, Pemba&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contents of Chapter I offer a snapshot of community perceptions in multiple locations across Mozambique. They should not be viewed as a comprehensive or fully representative reflection of other subnational or national perceptions, and are all subject to contextual sensitivities, personal preferences and imperfect information. Together, however, they provide an authentic interpretation of “lived insecurity” across specific moments and places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, such insights also offer important opportunities to assess the underlying mechanisms sustaining the threats cited. Indeed, while individual manifestations of insecurity may appear to be discrete phenomena, many coexist as symptoms of the same wicked problem, the full scope of which must be considered for effective policymaking. Drawing on both interview data and published sources, this chapter examines the systems enabling the wider environment of insecurity outlined in Chapter I – an accurate understanding of which raises important considerations for national and international programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-war-against-the-state-elite-capture-and-insecurity&quot;&gt;“A War Against the State”: Elite Capture and Insecurity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most prominent context of insecurity in Mozambique as viewed through a bottom-up lens is the interplay between insecurity and corruption and the role of elite actors. As noted, interview testimony across all sites reveals a deep-seated mistrust of state authority, with corruption across the state security apparatus viewed by interviewees as pervasive. In highlighting the perceived issues posed by elite dominance of corrupt networks, most respondents referred to politicians or political networks abstractly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, the perceived involvement of political actors in corrupt networks emerged frequently, and was viewed as contributing to the impunity described in Chapter I. Interviewees expressed the belief that political and economic elites can easily circumvent relevant legislation, allowing them free rein in relation to land rights, the terms of transportation of licit (and illicit) goods, and other key sectors of the economy. As a civil society activist in Angoche expressed: “Nowadays, if you have money, you can do whatever you want … with millions, one can corrupt the judiciary and even the government”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These views are hardly surprising against the backdrop of egregious corruption scandals involving members of the country’s political leadership. These include the so-called “hidden debt” scheme – the largest corruption scandal in Mozambican history, involving secret loans amounting to US$2 billion secured with undisclosed government guarantees. This episode saw corruption uncovered at multiple levels, implicating senior politicians – including former Finance Minister Manuel Chang – and plunging Mozambique into protracted economic turmoil. The cost and consequences of the “hidden debt” scandal to the country has been estimated at $11 billion – or $400 per citizen. With the trial of key players ongoing, the scandal has seen Mozambique’s ranking deteriorate on relevant global indices of governance, democracy and corruption for the 2010s and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this environment, political elites were viewed by interviewees as responsible for corruption among lower-level state security actors. While the mechanics of these relationships were not described, respondents frequently depicted elites as holding mastery over the nature of security actors’ involvement in corruption and integration into criminal networks. These dynamics were interpreted by respondents as part of a hierarchy of corruption, with lower-level security actors paying rents and kick-backs up the chain. Senior officials were depicted as guarantors of protection from law enforcement action and were described as using their status to influence investigative processes and judicial outcomes. An official interviewed for this research provided an example: “I know of a case at the airport police station. They seized rhino horns. Who came to collect them? The chief police commander. He came to the station and took them [away]”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly for this report, threat actors were viewed as having seized on pervasive corruption as a key political narrative – to wield what academic Fernando Jorge Cardoso has called “a war against the state”. This narrative is held to enable both insurgent actors and organised criminal networks to recruit new members and legitimise their activities. The term was used by Cardoso in relation to Cabo Delgado, describing the transformation, with the support of growing numbers of foreign fighters, of an initial “revolt” into an “ideological, civilisational and terrorist war” against “the state and the way of life of the overwhelming majority of the population”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardoso holds that the insurgency is targeted “not against the government or bad governance … [but] against the state” itself, although this does not “eliminate the government’s responsibility in relation to abuses of power, mal-practices … or the capture of mineral wealth, or its rent, by elites, … [or] the behaviour of government authorities or the inaction (by some considered complicity) against some type of urban banditry”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Cardoso distinguishes between the two, in reality it is challenging to separate state from government in a country in which Frelimo has governed uninterrupted, despite the transition to a multiparty democracy in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, public reports of abuses by government actors only exacerbate the “war against the state” he depicts – and the opportunities offered in terms of recruitment. In Cabo Delgado, for example, such a “war against the state” is reportedly being waged in an organised and explicit fashion by insurgent actors comprising both radicalised Mozambicans and foreign fighters. While drawing at times on the ideology of the Islamic State to organise and remain connected to the wider global movement – as well as to strengthen recruitment and fundraising efforts – attacks are often framed as addressing popular grievances against authority structures. Indeed, an anti-state, anti-Frelimo narrative features in much Al-Shabaab messaging, with the group presenting its legitimacy to rule as greater than the elected government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of this rhetoric abound. During a 2020 attack in Muidumbe, a spokesman stated: “We invaded to show the current government is unfair. … It humiliates the poor and gives advantages to the rich.” In this context, the insurgents claim that the creation of an “Islamic government” will offer a more socially just alternative, exploiting a perceived deep-seated lack of confidence in the state across communities in the country’s north. This approach is viewed by many as having resonance; in the words of human rights campaigner David Matsinhe, “the government has done for the radical preacher 80% of the job. He just comes to harvest.” As argued further by GITOC, “the policies (formal and informal) which have in the past secured the economic interests of the elite now play into the hands of the insurgents”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both corrupt governance and elite control of resources have been leveraged in insurgent rhetoric. Al-Shabaab leader Maulana Ali Cassimo has reportedly referenced past governmental injustices against artisanal miners in Niassa Reserve, presenting mining as one of the few remaining livelihoods for local people facing poor public sector service delivery. State security institutions are referenced using dehumanising terminology, with local people warned against “collaborating” with these agencies. Yet for all the efforts made to frame attacks in this way, insurgents have shown little interest in governing or maintaining power, when compared to negative strategic objectives such as forcing stoppages in the regional gas project and using terror to further undermine trust in state security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond support for the insurgency – and across the rest of the country – such a “war against the state” is experienced in different ways. In terms of support for organised crime, perceptions of entrenched state corruption and grievances around elite dominance of the formal economy serve as powerful factors incentivising local level involvement. Such dynamics have been observed in Nampula, Mozambique’s third-largest city, and in nearby Nacala Port, where they are held to manifest as part of a comprehensive “crime–conflict economy” featuring symbiotic relationships between organised criminal networks, some state institutions, the private sector and, at times and inadvertently, international donors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Nampula has long been a regional drug trafficking hub, this “crime–conflict economy” is assessed to have developed into an umbrella political–economic structure through which organised crime operates with impunity – and often explicit protection – from state security agencies. Local stakeholders are held to be easily incentivised to participate, exhibiting limited loyalty to a formal economic system deemed predatory and unfair. As noted by researchers Prem Mahadevan and Alastair Nelson, in a hub such as Nampula, “powerful stakeholders who derive tangible benefits from organized crime … may gain community respect by providing a loose and highly unpredictable form of employment to others who aspire to emulate them. Their wealth and accompanying social status allow them to act as in-person influencers, providing a twisted set of role models, particularly for younger community members, who see them enjoying immunity from both criminal justice and social criticism”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar dynamics are held to play out in subsidiary hubs such as Pemba, Nacala and Montepuez, enabling varying levels of support for organised crime. Meanwhile, further factors may incentivise local-level stakeholders to sustain illicit economies, including perceptions of the interests of this crime–conflict economy as determining decision-making on security agency deployment. The same applies at an international level, with external donors at times accused of playing an unintentional enabling role in this illicit crime–conflict economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;controlling-the-narrative&quot;&gt;Controlling the Narrative?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mozambican government has proven unable to effectively dispel the narratives propagated by threat actors. An example can be seen in the official response to the insurgency, with the government seeking to wield an impression of control by censoring media reporting and suppressing information flows. A range of cases of detentions of journalists has also been documented. Prominent examples include the arrest of journalist Amade Abubacar on charges including “public instigation through the use of electronic media”, “slander against forces of public order” and “association to commit an offence”, prior to his eventual release following calls from human rights organisations. Other cases include the disappearance in 2019 of radio journalist Ibraimo Mbaruco, whose last text message – “surrounded by soldiers” – prompted speculation that he had been abducted by the military. Despite calls from international organisations to locate Mbaruco, investigations were suspended and the case closed in August 2024, a move denounced by CDD as “a continuation of the Attorney General’s Office’s denial of access to justice for journalists”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppression of independent reporting has been criticised by analysts as a move to prevent the exposure of governmental weakness and state abuses in the region. Yet the resultant information vacuum has not always had this effect and at times has given rise to conspiracy theories. As reported by GITOC, these include narratives “alleging that the insurgency is a false-flag operation instigated by Frelimo politicians, connected to a bid for greater profits from LNG (liquefied natural gas) or the illicit economy”. Meanwhile, many citizens appear dissatisfied with a media landscape characterised by persistent attacks on journalists, with the country dropping to 105th of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index in 2024, and Reporters Without Borders pointing to a “worrisome decline in press freedom in Mozambique”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the government has sought to control the narrative, messaging has occasionally been inconsistent. For example, descriptions of the insurgency put forth by government sources have varied, while the threat has sometimes been downplayed. Notably, the Mozambican government initially appeared reluctant to label Al-Shabaab as a terrorist organisation, portraying the insurgents as a collection of common criminals without legitimate grievances. At times, it has pointed to potential exploitation of these individuals by foreign groups to destabilise Mozambique. Yet not until 2019 did Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi use the term “terrorism” in relation to the violence in Cabo Delgado, while official institutional acknowledgement came in April 2020, with the National Defence and Security Council statement that the country was facing “external aggression perpetrated by terrorists”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gus Waschefort, Jessie Phyffer and Martha M Bradley posit that such delays may have been attempts “to avoid the application of protections offered by international human rights law (IHRL) and IHL [international humanitarian law]”. Meanwhile, heavy reliance at various stages on private military companies has seen the government accused of lacking transparency about operations in the region. Such perceived obfuscation has ultimately allowed threat actors to control the narrative – in a battle between insurgents and state that has become as much about public rhetoric as territorial advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is concerning in light of reports of a shift in insurgent strategy towards less violent tactics and moves to win over local inhabitants. This has been variously reported to encompass efforts to limit civilian casualties, urge cooperation with insurgents and engage with community members in what some have labelled a “hearts and minds” campaign. As observed by the International Crisis Group (ICG), such a shift in strategy could be aimed at garnering popular support and securing supply lines amidst territorial losses to government and international forces. Such moves risk further entrenching the insurgency, complicating the response and establishing conditions for further retaliatory violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-and-economic-marginalisation&quot;&gt;Political and Economic Marginalisation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, underpinning local level concerns over state capture are a range of wider factors linked to political and economic marginalisation. A crucial context of insecurity in Mozambique as viewed through a bottom-up lens, these factors featured in interview testimony across all sites as expressions of discontent over entrenched poverty, exclusion and lack of employment opportunities. Intimately connected with the disaffection respondents expressed over corruption and inequality of access to key services, these issues must be considered as cross-cutting dynamics enabling these insecurities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mozambique is a predominantly rural country, with 61% of its population based in rural areas in 2023. Poverty levels are high: in 2020, 62.8% of the population were reported to live in poverty, based on a threshold of $1.90/day. While the country has abundant natural resources and access to arable land and water, energy resources and deep ports, persistent challenges from political instability, frequent natural disasters and acute vulnerability to climate change have suppressed progress on poverty reduction. Meanwhile, despite advances in a range of areas – from increasing access to education to declining child mortality rates – progress has been uneven, with economic growth assessed to be increasingly less inclusive and levels of inequality rising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, many respondents identified poverty and inequality as major drivers of insecurity. They identified causal links between unemployment, poverty (including frustration caused by poverty) and the high crime rates seen in a range of sites, albeit without reference to specific criminal activities. A civil society activist in Maputo pointed to opportunistic crime, highlighting as a driver the inability of many residents to purchase food and non-food items to meet basic individual or family needs. Beyond material poverty, inequality was cited as a driver of crime and other forms of violent disorder. A Maputo-based priest summed up a widely held view: “Poverty and social injustice, characterised by significant disparities between the haves and have-nots, create fertile ground for violence. While poverty cannot justify criminality or violence, unfortunately, the desperation caused by hunger may drive people to do anything to survive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unemployed youth were seen as particularly vulnerable. Respondents often spoke of this demographic as being involved in criminality, regularly alluding to their resorting to crime to feed drug addictions. Some cited attitudinal as well as socioeconomic factors, referencing an obsession with money, a desire for rapid enrichment, and an intrinsic lack of motivation to work or study. Yet more often interviewees recognised the lack of basic income and employment opportunities as major drivers of youth involvement in petty crime, mirroring a number of published studies. In these accounts, young people were recognised to be literally hungry, but also figuratively hungry for opportunities, such as education. The barriers they face in actualising these opportunities were cited by interviewees. A youth mentor in Nacala described the need for young people to pay to access employment, marginalising those without the means to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contrast between this situation and growing investment across key locations was highlighted. The feelings of exclusion fomented where other, often foreign, stakeholders benefit from domestic resources and industries were stressed in all interview sites. Growth was viewed as a negative: in the words of a journalist interviewee, “Nacala is growing, there are new investments and this increases security risks”. Another Nacala-based interviewee viewed this as translating directly into rates of engagement in crime, noting that: “Big companies are not employing locals. Those few who are employed work as security guards, with bosses from [elsewhere] … who … become chiefs upon arrival. If at least 50% of those working in the companies were Nacala natives, we would have very low levels of criminality. Poverty pushes people into the world of crime.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large-scale displacement was viewed as exacerbating this situation. As of 2023, Mozambique hosted more than 850,000 internally displaced persons and 30,000 refugees and asylum seekers, according to the UN Refugee Agency. Internally, residents have been forced to flee both ongoing conflict (in the north) and natural disasters (across a range of locations), with the country among the most vulnerable to climate change globally. In the face of violent disruption and displacement, as well as variable experiences of spontaneous return, some scholars have pointed to an increased propensity to join criminal groups. Some interviewees also reported wariness of those migrating in search of employment opportunities. In the words of a teaching professional interviewee, “many people migrate to Montepuez seeking better living conditions, but resort to criminality when they fail to improve their lives”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poverty and a lack of realisable opportunities were also identified by interviewees as drivers of violent extremism. In Angoche and Nacala, fear around the ease of recruitment of youth from local communities appeared more substantive than fear of the terrorist threat itself. Particularly in Nacala, young people with limited opportunities were viewed as susceptible to recruitment narratives, including those oriented around job prospects in Cabo Delgado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perceived powerlessness of those offering counter-narratives was stressed. As one respondent noted: “Nacala is one of the sources of youth recruitment for Cabo Delgado. Poverty is one of the reasons young people join terrorist groups. Churches, mosques, the media and governmental entities work to sensitise young people to discourage them from joining terrorist groups. However, no speech is strong enough to overcome poverty”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond recruitment, widespread marginalisation forms a key backdrop for the emergence of the insurgency itself. Cabo Delgado is located in Mozambique’s poorest region, situated over 2,500 km by road from the capital in the south. Despite its economic potential, including sizeable natural gas reserves and deposits of precious stones, many residents remain unable to access meaningful development opportunities, as do others based elsewhere across the country. Instead, as noted by Julia Stanyard and others, they have “borne decades of government neglect, extreme poverty and widespread corruption [while watching] … elite politically connected groups seizing the benefits of the region’s natural resources and profiteering from criminal markets”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liazzat J K Bonate has described these grievances as the “emotional entry points” that allowed jihadism to take root in 2017. Yet insurgent exploitation of marginalisation among local communities has a longer history. Specifically, many of the roots of the current conflict can be traced back to Mozambique’s colonial period and 1964–74 War of Independence. Cabo Delgado was a pivotal area during the war, as local people protested oppression by Portuguese colonial authorities who were viewed as unfairly extracting, and denying local people access to, wealth and resources. The Frelimo movement advocated for independence as the route to social justice and a fairer share of the province’s wealth. As such, similarities exist between the narratives of today’s insurgents and those previously seeking to overthrow the colonial regime. As noted by Joseph Hanlon: “The grievance was the same in both wars. Independence had been the flag 50 years earlier; this time, the flag is Islam.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since independence, the memories of many individuals nationwide, from guerrilla fighters to political prisoners and other marginalised groups, reveal a sense of exclusion from post-colonial narratives around national identity and development. These issues played into the wider conflict waged between Frelimo and then-guerilla organisation Renamo from the late 1970s. Similar sentiments still resonate, with unrest following Frelimo’s declaration of victory in the country’s 2024 presidential elections causing many Mozambicans, as described by Marilio Wane, to “ask whether the values, symbols, and institutions created to give shape to ‘national unity’ are still legitimate today”. Indeed, while the ruling Frelimo party has asserted its “ownership” of the liberation war’s legacy, other groups across the country have historically felt marginalised in the official narrative. Notably, in the post-independence era, the government adopted a highly centralised model that sought to concentrate power and integrate diverse regions under one national identity. Yet this model struggled to incorporate many citizens, feeding the level of popular support for Renamo during the country’s civil war in many rural locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, many citizens have long felt excluded from the political and economic benefits that followed independence. In the north, meanwhile, the introduction of Wahhabi ideologies in the late colonial period, which diverged from local Islamic traditions, added another layer of complexity. Over time, radical Islamist ideologies began to resonate with segments of the population, as socioeconomic conditions in the region deteriorated. In recent years, insurgents have drawn on widespread discontent, positioning themselves in opposition to the state’s perceived failures, and exploiting inequalities drawn over socioeconomic, political, religious and ethnic lines, including between the Muslim-majority Makua and Mwani and the Christian-majority Makonde. In this context, the drivers of insurgency can be summarised as “a cocktail of interconnected internal factors: from socio-economic and socio-political factors to cultural and religious factors and factors related to the lack of public security that [have] allowed illicit activities to flourish”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, underlying discontent around marginalisation has also historically been intertwined with the broader relationship between the Mozambican state and traditional authority structures – a contentious issue, notably, during the country’s civil war. For much of the post-independence period, the state actively suppressed “customary” or indigenous leadership in favour of a more centralised form of governance. In recent years, such a contest between state control and local autonomy has persisted and, in some locations, feelings of exclusion may be exacerbated by the disconnect felt by community members from decision-making under a centralised model of government. Despite the implementation of a range of processes to expedite decentralisation, little power and authority is devolved to local administration structures in practice, limiting the potential for citizen participation and influence around issues affecting them at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, large-scale exploration and resource exploitation have served to exacerbate some of these tensions. While Mozambique is a country blessed with natural gas and oil – as well as rubies, graphite and precious woods – the benefits of these industries have not been shared equitably with the population. Instead, extractive and other private industries are at times perceived to have exacerbated inequality, with local communities facing displacement, environmental degradation and a lack of economic opportunities. This fits into a longer-term trajectory, with recent decades having seen a deepening of the basic patterns of extractivism instigated by Mozambique’s integration into global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration between foreign investors and local elites across the political economy of natural resource extraction in the country has exacerbated the sense of marginalisation felt by many citizens. Excluded from the benefits, some are reported to have turned to the insurgency as a means of expressing their discontent and seeking material rewards. Egna Sidumo, Marko Svicevic and Martha M Bradley point to the Palma attack as a pivotal expression of these dynamics in the north, given Palma’s proximity to major international exploration projects. Described as a “turning point” in the conflict, the attack forced the latest suspension of French energy company TotalEnergies’s operations at its $20-billion gas liquification plant in the region – the largest foreign investment in Africa. Sidumo, Svicevic and Bradley point to discontent over the granting of significant areas of land in Cabo Delgado on concession to prospectors, investors and mining companies, “reinforcing arguments according to which the main cause of the conflict … was the interest of global powers, allied with national political elites”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, it is clear that many of the security challenges witnessed, in Cabo Delgado and beyond, are deeply intertwined with the country’s colonial and post-colonial history and should be understood as the culmination of long-standing sociopolitical and economic trends. The insurgency in particular should be seen not only or even primarily as a product of radical Islamic ideology, but rather as a response to long-standing grievances about exclusion, injustice and deprivation. The insurgency is also a product of the Mozambican state’s perceived inability to address these grievances at best and active complicity in driving them at worst. At times, this may separate out the motivations of Mozambican and foreign insurgents. As noted by the ICG: “While foreigners have joined in the name of jihad, most of the Mozambican rank and file militants are motivated by their perceived socio-economic exclusion amid major mineral and hydrocarbon discoveries in the region”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;elite-dominance-of-illicit-economies&quot;&gt;Elite Dominance of Illicit Economies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this discussion of marginalisation, the legitimate economy is not the only domain of relevance. Instead, differential access to entrenched, and thriving, illicit economies was a further point of reference in interviews across all sites. Here, Many respondents pointed to elite control over both commercial natural resource exploitation and the proceeds of crime generated by the range of large-scale trafficking flows to which the country plays host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mozambique has long acted as an illicit economic corridor to the wider region. Due to its geographical location, extensive coastline and proximity to consumer markets in South Africa, the country is a transit hub for an array of illicit commodities. State-embedded actors are alleged to be involved in a range of illicit economies, as well as in providing protection to criminal enterprises. As noted by GI-TOC: “The ruling party tends to be reactive rather than proactive towards criminal entrepreneurship, allowing for high-level state corruption and virtual impunity for politicians accused of corrupt relationships with criminal traders”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular discontent over a perception of elite actors profiteering from criminal markets has deepened as Mozambique’s role in a range of illicit supply chains has remained in flux. Drugs and illicit extraction of natural resources are reported to comprise the largest criminal markets, while the country also acts as a significant waypoint and destination market for human trafficking. In parallel, illicit trade in excise and counterfeit goods with neighbouring countries is assessed to be rife, damaging key aspects of the licit economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 1990s the country has been a major hub along the so-called “southern route” for heroin originating in Afghanistan, moving via Pakistan and Iran to East Africa, mainly via Tanzania and Mozambique, and on to South Africa and Europe. In recent years, trade in methamphetamines along the same route has reportedly also grown, alongside increased production in Afghanistan. The criminal groups involved are reported to be active in all of Mozambique’s provinces, as part of what GITOC has described as a “tightly regulated network run by families connected to the political elite, with the state controlling most of the heroin market”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mozambique is also increasingly viewed as a node in the global cocaine trade. This comes as part of a growing set of connections between domestic criminal actors and organised crime groups in Latin America, especially Brazil. Indeed, the arrest in Maputo of a high-ranking associate of the Brazilian criminal organisation Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC) suggests that Mozambique is becoming a more significant part of the “Lusophone route” for cocaine from Latin America to Africa, alongside longer-established nodes in Portuguese-speaking Angola, Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde. Mozambique’s pre-existing involvement in other illicit networks reportedly provides the infrastructure to facilitate the transit of cocaine, with allegations that the PCC collaborates closely with domestic political elites to protect their operations. This is reportedly enabled by increased maritime trade links with Brazil, initially sparked by a 2015 trade agreement between the two countries facilitating the import of containerised goods, including those in transit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of natural resources, a range of illegally sourced and traded products are of particular concern. Notably, Mozambique has substantive timber resources, which were exploited extensively under Portuguese rule. In 2013, the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) estimated that 76% of timber exports comprised illegally cut wood, with China the major consumer market. In 2024, EIA found that an average of 500,000 tons of timber had been exported to China annually since 2017, in violation of Mozambique’s log export ban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Mozambique’s mining industry has been plagued by illegal activity. The country has rich deposits of gemstones, trade in which was largely dominated by artisanal miners in the 1980s and 1990s, when the country was closed to large multinationals. Into the 2000s and 2010s, the sector was subject to greater regulation, with the government granting concessions to large companies and introducing compulsory mining licences in 2016 for artisanal miners. Yet reported control of concessions by political elites, combined with allegations of widespread corruption and a lack of alternative livelihoods, has pushed many miners to operate illegally as part of an extensive illicit market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wildlife crime is reportedly rife, with the country acting as a source and transit hub for numerous commodities. Mozambique has long played a significant role in transnational ivory trafficking, as indicated by a substantial decline in domestic elephant populations and large numbers of seizures elsewhere linked to the country. According to the Great Elephant Census, from 2009 to 2014 the country lost 53% of its elephants, while EIA has identified Pemba as a key hub for the processing of multi-ton consignments destined for China. It is also assessed that Mozambique acts as a significant source and transit point for commodities from rhino horn to lion and abalone, while suffering high levels of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing enabled by corruption across supervisory bodies and political elites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside legitimate sectors of the economy, the alleged capture of these illicit industries by domestic elites was lamented in interview testimony. This was a particularly prominent theme in locations where the shadow economy exists as the pre-eminent sphere of economic activity. The country’s north, for example, has always served as a key economic corridor when it comes to illicit trade. With Tanzania serving as the closest source of supplies for many communities, centuries of informal cross-border trade across an estimated 40 informal entry points have allowed transnational smuggling to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, as perceived by a teaching professional interviewed in Pemba, “organised crime … appears to be on the rise”. In illustrating this perspective, interviewees cited major seizures, including in Mocimboa da Praia of more than 100 containers of unprocessed wood, as well as heroin and cocaine seizures in Macomia and Murrebué. In such cases, a perceived lack of action following the confiscation of illegal commodities was lamented across interview testimony. In the words of a civil society activist in Pemba, when the authorities seize drugs, “they don’t follow through on cases, leading me to believe that organised crime has political hands or powerful backers at the community, provincial, national or even international levels”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many interviewees framed perceived elite dominance of these illicit trade networks through the same lens as the capture of gas and gemstone profits within the legitimate economy, stressing the exclusion of local communities from the resultant benefits. Similar parallels have been drawn by international observers, who have highlighted the totality of elite dominance of the region’s politics and economy. Stanyard and others have shown financial rewards from Mozambique’s illicit economies to accrue to many of the same senior political stakeholders and business elites that have used corrupt practices to cultivate interests across the country’s mining, forestry and transport logistics sectors. The disaffection this has bred at community level is sorely felt; for Stanyard and others, “the scale of corruption and elite control is matched only by Cabo Delgado’s extreme levels of marginalization and poverty”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-and-international-responses&quot;&gt;National and International Responses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of this chapter has examined cross-cutting issues underpinning the insecurities outlined in Chapter I. A vital question that remains is how far, and how effectively, have national and international stakeholders sought to respond to these cross-cutting problems? Interviewees offered perspectives on this question which, combined with analysis across published sources, provide insight into popular perceptions of the response to core drivers of the security issues identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across all sites, a common view emerging in interview testimony was that national and international interventions have failed to engage with many of the underlying contexts and drivers of insecurity as viewed through a bottom-up lens. Most prominently, respondents denounced a perceived failure to address systemic corruption, improve governance or promote the rule of law, among other fundamental issues. International stakeholders were viewed as having done little to incentivise national-level actors to adjust their approach, with these views amounting to an overarching impression of pessimism regarding the potential for meaningful change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted previously, for much of the past decade, the dominant concern of national and international stakeholders has appeared to be counterterrorism. Several interviewees expressed the view that this focus may be out of sync with other local-level concerns, coming at the cost of interventions targeting more immediate community security priorities in a range of locations. The national-level response was described as highly state-centric, based on an approach favouring military responses over a more holistic approach. In Cabo Delgado, for example, the government is held to have primarily relied on its armed forces and police, private military companies and foreign military forces to quell the insurgency, over concerted efforts to address the conflict’s deeper causes. Elsewhere in the country, a similar lack of engagement among national and international stakeholders is reported, with the underlying factors enabling insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempts have been made to redress this balance. In Cabo Delgado, for example, with donor support, the government has developed a $300-million reconstruction plan and a $2.5-billion Northern Resilience and Integrated Development Strategy (ERDIN) to include other northern provinces. The latter is designed in line with three pillars that speak to a more holistic approach: “support for peace building, security and social cohesion”, “reconstruction of the social contract between the state and the population” and “economic recovery and resilience”. Community-level participation is also planned in the development of a National Body for Peace and Reconciliation, charged with addressing the underlying drivers of violent extremism and preventing conflict across the country as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet these plans have been dismissed by some in the face of a perceived lack of political will. Some respondents remained sceptical of the government’s stated intention to provide broader development, viewing action in this space as a means of prioritising the government’s energy interests in areas where multinational companies operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This critique is echoed across the published literature, as are concerns over a perceived governmental failure to recognise the contribution of internal factors – including marginalisation and state violence – to insecurity. Beyond this, observers note that patterns of governance in the north remain little changed, with the ongoing perceived influence of corruption and political patronage viewed offering little hope that the benefits of development and reconstruction funds will be spread widely. As articulated by Stanyard et al. with reference to the situation in the north specifically, “the prevailing view in Mozambique is that the government will prioritize security for gas developments in Cabo Delgado, rather than sustainable development for the local population and improved governance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The governmental response to organised crime is similarly held to centre on law enforcement. Here, resources have been focused on the pursuit of individual actors, rather than efforts to prevent crime from happening or to tackle cross-cutting factors enabling illicit activity. Such an enforcement-focused response is itself held to suffer key gaps: although the country’s legal framework is generally judged to be adequate, capacity to investigate and prosecute remains limited. Meanwhile, the collective understanding of key threats and associated drivers remains incomplete across a number of forms of criminality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While various administrations have stressed the need to tackle organised crime and corruption, the response is further complicated by the perceived extent of complicity of state-embedded actors. Indeed, with some state actors widely held to be complicit in hindering countermeasures, the main barrier to an effective response may be neither strategy nor law enforcement capacity, but a lack of political will to tackle the problem. This characterisation may be supported by the disproportionate targeting of law enforcement action against those involved in low-level transactions with little political protection. At the same time, interviewees lamented what was perceived as the regular dismissal of cases against organised criminals where political protection is in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, state-security institutions were viewed as having limited ability or interest in meaningfully addressing criminality. In this context, interviewees remained sceptical that programming aimed at professionalisation – such as a 1997–2007 $33.7-million reform programme led by the United Nations Development Programme that focused on capacity-building, training and equipment – had significant impact. Similar views were expressed in relation to efforts, with international support from the 2000s, to support community engagement and policing – although in some cases, non-state forms of policing and dispute resolution have evolved into alternatives to a mistrusted state system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;donor-led-approaches-incongruent-and-unbalanced&quot;&gt;Donor-Led Approaches: Incongruent and Unbalanced&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of donors in addressing insecurity was addressed specifically by some interviewees. Over the past decade, many described international funding as having disproportionately focused on supporting the Mozambican armed forces to counter the insurgency in the north. Military interventions by Rwanda and SADC were highlighted as the most visible element, with the US also providing counterterrorism training to the Mozambican armed forces and the EU launching a €15-million training mission in 2022, alongside providing €89 million-worth of non-lethal equipment and supplies. Nationwide, beyond the situation in Cabo Delgado, international support in other forms was also cited. Agencies such as UNODC have provided advice on policy and strategy, as well as technical assistance, to tackle organised crime and terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a donor focus, alongside the government’s prioritisation of law enforcement and military approaches, has prompted analysts to call for a stronger international focus on the underlying drivers of insecurity. Academic Albert K Domson-Lindsay, for example, has called for international security actors to adopt a broader approach to security in Mozambique that goes beyond a simple fight against Islamic fundamentalism. While a military response is required, he argues, this must come in conjunction with concerted, long-term efforts to address broader drivers of insecurity across the country – identified as poor governance, centralisation of power and marginalisation of minority groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognising these issues, various interventions have sought to strengthen governance and build integrity across the security sector. As part of its “Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability, 10-Year Plan for Mozambique” (2022–32), the US has prioritised professionalising institutions across the country through the development of more transparent, accountable and effective systems, including in the security sector. Via the Maputo Roadmap framework, UNODC is engaged in work nationwide to strengthen the rule of law through improved justice systems and integrity in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice, among other outcomes. Other interventions have sought to build resilience through participatory approaches across the country, with the EU providing security assistance as part of an “integrated approach” encompassing humanitarian, development, regional and local peacebuilding efforts, as well as police capacity building and initiatives to foster community-level dialogue among civic leaders. Meanwhile, in 2021, the World Bank approved Mozambique’s eligibility for the Prevention and Resilience Allocation, which provides enhanced support for countries at risk of escalating into high-intensity conflict or large-scale violence, while granting $100 million from the International Development Association to support recovery activities focused on restoring livelihoods, building social cohesion and improving access to basic services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From existing baselines, however, it is likely to take generations for these interventions to have the necessary effect. Crucially, despite this activity, Mozambique’s ranking has worsened on core governance matrices, with the country reported to be in urgent need of more transparent, participatory and decentralised governance. Further complicating international assistance in these areas is the need to account for longstanding concern over state actors misusing development assistance: over the last two decades, donors have regularly suspended budgetary support, the principal modality of aid to the country, because of concerns about corruption. In many cases, however, aid flows have resumed in the absence of meaningful reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues speak to further critiques of external engagement in these areas. A prominent local-level narrative questions whether donors are genuinely interested in improving governance as a major factor hindering sustainable development and improved security. This perspective draws on a longer-term view of international assistance, dating back to the aid operation put in place in the 1990s in the aftermath of the civil war, through large-scale efforts to privatise state-run industries, to pare back the public sector and to deregulate the economy according to the neoliberal mandate of the Bretton Woods institutions (the World Bank and the IMF). This orthodoxy saw the provision of aid linked closely to the country’s compliance with neoliberal economic principles, almost to the exclusion of other considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this historical backdrop, donor efforts to support reform of the criminal justice system are recognised to have lacked cohesion. More fundamentally, the international community is itself accused of creating the conditions for insecurity to thrive. In the words of analyst Alexander Chance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The priority attached to rapid economic liberalisation without adequate social security provision and regulatory oversight appears to have directly fuelled corruption. Trumpeting “good governance” whilst consistently failing to follow-up on concerns not only demonstrated donors’ weakness in this area, but also left members of civil society dangerously isolated … Similarly, an unwillingness to take seriously and act upon warnings over the financial clout and political patronage of organised crime left the criminal justice system incapable of halting its reach into the highest echelons of the state. Over time, Mozambique’s apparent success story in development terms was allowed to dominate donor narratives, whilst corruption and criminality exacerbated inequality and fuelled distrust of the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With international exploitation of the country’s energy riches booming, such concerns remain rife. A number of commentators have accused international actors of systematically overlooking corrupt behaviour to secure lucrative natural resource deals. Rwandan forces, for example, are accused of concentrating deployments on sites in the north known for their potential for gas exploitation and gemstone extraction, with speculation that France’s funding for the expedition is motivated by French company TotalEnergies’s interests in Cabo Delgado. As analyst Joseph Hanlon observes: “The government survived the very loud donor-cut off of significant aid in 2016 due to the $2 billion secret debt. … Donors and now the IMF have quietly crept back into the fold, without major concessions by government. Foreign governments want a presence because of the gas and the potential to win huge contracts. So they cannot afford to challenge Frelimo misconduct.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar concerns emerged during interviews in a range of sites. In the view of a journalist in Maputo, “foreign entities continue to inadvertently prop up a flawed security infrastructure” without adequate oversight or accountability. Particular concerns were expressed over the manipulation of donor support in ways held to be harmful to the population. As summarised by the same respondent, “foreign entities … tend to supply weaponry and other equipment [that are used] not for the enhancement of security … but rather … to quash peaceful protests”. In this context, calls were made for international actors to “re-evaluate their role in security, considering not just the provision or sale of equipment to Mozambican authorities, but also the ethical terms of its usage to genuinely bolster security instead of furthering a specific, often harmful, agenda”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final perspective emerging from interviews concerned a strong sense of disaffection over programming undertaken without adequate local-level consultation. Such a sense of exclusion was expressed in all sites, with concerns raised around the effectiveness – and potentially harmful effects – of associated interventions. As noted by one respondent, “here in Nacala, we have national and international NGOs. Their interventions are not preceded by studies to understand local dynamics … they arrive with set goals, more concerned about numbers than necessarily solving problems for the youths”. As expressed by a civil society activist in Maputo, “one significant error made by foreign analysts when assessing Mozambique’s security context is their lack of a holistic understanding of the ground reality”. This was dismissed in Pemba as resulting in “recommendations that might not align with the actual situation” in key subnational contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outsiders don’t engage with the community facing these problems, they analyse based on government reports … many of [which] … don’t reflect the real situation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;--interview-with-local-official-maputo&quot;&gt;- Interview with local official, Maputo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many individuals at the local level in Mozambique live in environments characterised by pervasive insecurity. The objective of this report is to go beyond conventional elite discourse and donor perceptions to build the beginnings of a “bottom-up” understanding of insecurity as a starting point for analysing Mozambique’s threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings across Angoche, Maputo, Montepuez, Nacala and Pemba – varied subnational contexts with diverse social, economic and political dynamics – offer a range of insights into community-level perceptions and experiences of key harms and dangers. While individual accounts of “lived insecurity” differed across key moments and places, consistencies emerged in the form of a dominant focus on the threats posed by petty crime, street-level insecurity, state abuses and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, accounts of petty crime – often targeted at property and the person – extended to a discussion of transnational trafficking and other forms of organised criminality. The threat from insurgent activity, meanwhile, was often perceived as a peripheral issue insofar as it affected interviewees’ day-to-day lives – in all locations except Pemba, where concern over this phenomenon was elevated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This local-level positioning of violent extremism, often as secondary to more mundane, street-level concerns, speaks to a potential discordance with the priorities of national and international stakeholders. While a range of programmes have sought to improve citizen security and professionalise the police response to day-to-day public harms, the approach to insecurity taken by the government and its international partners over the past seven years was at times viewed by interviewees as reductionist – oriented around a simple fight against Islamic fundamentalism in Cabo Delgado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interconnections across threats were frequently drawn in interview testimony. In many accounts, public sector corruption was perceived as a core characteristic of the security landscape – bisecting and enabling many of the other threats cited. Viewed as the defining feature of the country’s governance, the establishment of perverse incentives was perceived to leave many citizens underserved by police and other security agencies. In this context, an overarching narrative of victimisation emerged, with many community-level stakeholders presenting themselves as abandoned or, in some cases, exploited by state security services. This appeared from interviews to have damaged their affinity to a shared social compact, challenging theoretical notions of policing by consent and undermining the perceived legitimacy of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This situation was presented as having set in motion a search for alternative security structures. Interviewees outlined their views of both private security provision and community self-defence initiatives – with both strengths and a range of gaps, weaknesses and legitimacy issues described across these perceived alternative avenues for self and group protection. At times, the pursuit of these options was perceived itself to fuel instability. In the words of a local official in Angoche, “when people feel threatened, their first reaction is to defend themselves. … [Yet] automatically triggered defense mechanisms lead to misunderstandings and conflicts, escalating latent tensions into violence”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, local insecurities were understood as expressions of deeply rooted, long-term trends. As argued in this report, they exist within the same enabling environment, as the product of historical path dependencies that have contributed to a widespread normalisation of violence. Most frequently, interviewees perceived elite capture of the state as a key cross-cutting context of insecurity as viewed through a bottom-up lens. Interviewees also pointed to entrenched political and economic marginalisation, often contrasting this with booming international investment in natural resource exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elite extractivism and deepening inequality, in turn, were held to have exacerbated latent tensions that could be easily exploited by criminal and insurgent actors. Importantly, such dynamics have played out against a long history with a continuum of violence and contestation based on similar grievances stretching back to Mozambique’s colonial experience, the 1964–74 war of independence and the 1976–92 civil war. Over the decades, meanwhile, national and international interventions were viewed as having ignored – and at times exacerbated – these conditions, with calls made for more transparent, participatory and decentralised governance in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings paint the picture of a complex and deeply rooted system of local-level insecurity, raising important considerations for policymakers and practitioners. Local-level perceptions of the gaps in existing national and international ameliorative programming offer further valuable insights for those looking to support more holistic security interventions. In particular, a marked sense of local-level exclusion from the formulation of external interventions was apparent, with this phenomenon held to limit the effectiveness of ground- level programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on the findings of this research, this report offers a series of recommendations for national and international programming, targeting key aspects of the juxtaposition between existing approaches and the experiences of communities on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External programming must be designed, adapted and validated based on meaningful local-level consultation that internalises the interests and lived experience of community actors across Mozambique.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Bottom-up engagement is crucial to the successful design and ground-level implementation of a range of security interventions. In planning such engagement, international stakeholders must account for a widespread lack of trust in past and present programming at the grassroots level. They should therefore work with national authorities where possible to map and learn from past engagement efforts, whether in relation to the insurgency in Cabo Delgado or wider insecurity experienced across the country. This must be done while ensuring adequate tailoring of consultation processes at the programme design phase while being mindful of the need to disaggregate specific approaches to account for the variety of conditions and experiences of lived insecurity at the subnational level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efforts to professionalise law enforcement agencies must have at their core a focus on improving relations with the populations they are mandated to serve.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In the face of diminished trust in state security and law enforcement agencies across Mozambique, the provision of external programming must be made contingent on national-level engagement in the professionalisation of key agencies into service-oriented institutions that protect all citizens. As a key part of this, interventions to address security force culture, management and accountability structures must be prioritised, with particular corruption risks and vulnerabilities identified and addressed. In parallel, local, national and international drivers of corruption within these institutions must be analysed and addressed as part of a broader approach focused on improving communication and trust between the population and the state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focused support should be provided to Mozambican civil society groups and NGOs performing potentially crucial roles in monitoring crime prevention and strengthening resilience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Programming in collaboration with Mozambican civil society stakeholders should be prioritised, building the capacity of specific actors and allowing them to use the additional capability to solve problems on local terms, in response to ground-level priorities. This should be done while working to ensure a national-level environment that respects civil society rights and freedoms, facilitates access to relevant information and guarantees the ability of third-sector stakeholders in Mozambique to work independently across monitoring, reporting and conflict-resolution functions, including in relation to the insurgency in the north. Civil society should also be engaged wherever possible in crime and violence prevention debates and interventions, giving voice to local-level expertise and experience, and engaging, as appropriate, with community-level policing and security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical assistance programming across Mozambique must take politics seriously, with interventions tailored to the political economies of key sectors and institutions at the local and national levels.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Interventions aimed at improving governance across the Mozambican security sector must be informed by in-depth political economy analysis, dissecting interest and power structures to identify agents with (and without) incentives to support sustainable reform on the ground. This analysis should extend beyond the central Mozambican policy establishment and consider specific contextual and institutional factors at the district and provincial levels – accounting, for example, for potential discontent at this level over the instrumentalisation of the security apparatus by elite actors, and over the conditions experienced in some cases by lower-ranking members of the police and military. Policy and programming should be formulated accordingly, drawing on real opportunities to influence a more publicly oriented form of security governance, and ensuring the feasibility of planned interventions in light of vested interests across the political and security spheres.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International programming must better account for the role of some state actors in the production and maintenance of insecurity in Mozambique, and as potential spoilers in reform efforts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A central theme across the research for this report concerns the extent of perceived official complicity in criminality and violence and the fluidity between licit and illicit activity. There is an urgent need for reflection among donors on how programming is undertaken considering these conditions, and a need to be mindful of the long history of misuse of security and development funds in Mozambique. Alternative models of provision that account for the perceived role of some state actors and institutions not only as providers of security, but also as agents in the production of insecurity are required, based on in-depth political economy analysis across the Mozambican security architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A focus on the drivers of crime and violence should be prioritised, with programming moving beyond symptoms to address underlying structural dynamics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A prioritised research agenda should be supported to inform programming targeting the underlying drivers of insecurity in Mozambique – mindful of the ways in which these dynamics may vary at a district and provincial level. Based on this, investment to address economic inequality should be prioritised and delivered in a way that is locally-based and transparent, with a focus on training and capacity building, investment in skills and education, sustainable management of the natural resource sector as an avenue for local growth and opportunity, infrastructure development and enhanced access to finance. A specific youth focus should feature in such economic empowerment programmes, with specific vulnerabilities accounted for in delivery. This should come as part of a concerted focus on crime and violence prevention, engaging Mozambican civil society and private sector actors with the potential to contribute more actively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunities should be explored to address the role of local government and support decentralised structures capable of allowing meaningful popular participation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A key focus of external stakeholders should be on identifying options to engage with elected local structures capable of enabling greater community participation in decision-making, mindful of the perceived need for more decentralised, accountable and participatory governance. Where appropriate, opportunities should be explored to deliver development assistance not only through central government, but also at a district and provincial level, based on in-depth risk assessment and analysis of the relevant political economies. Efforts to strengthen local-level participation could also see community-level civil society actors and leaders brought into governance roles across relevant initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulation and oversight of private security companies should be strengthened to mitigate risks of human rights abuses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Monitoring of the activities of private security providers should be bolstered, with interventions prioritised to bolster inspection and regulatory capacity. This should come as part of a strengthened focus on the terms of engagement with the private sector operating in Mozambique more broadly. While the Mozambican government has indicated its intention to draw on frameworks such as the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights to guide security relationships between extractive companies, state and non-state security actors, and communities – and although a number of companies operating in Mozambique use these principles – gaps remain across the extractive sector, with a wider government-led effort required to improve the human rights environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

Sanctions can be a useful tool to counter malign operations – if enforced correctly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tackling Russia’s continued attempts to undermine Western democracies requires resilience against disinformation. Russian propaganda has been targeting Western countries by aiming to discredit events such as the Paris Olympics and influence electoral processes, including those of Romania and Moldova, as a recent discussion at RUSI’s Centre for Finance and Security highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU sanctions against the Kremlin’s war propaganda show that democracies do have the tools to defend themselves. The European External Action Service recently published its Third Report on Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference Threats (FIMI), which also highlights sanctions as part of the EU’s toolbox to combat disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While sanctions against disinformation remain a contentious issue from a freedom of speech perspective, they can be used as legitimate tools to counter harmful propaganda – but implementation and enforcement, as well as a lack of similar tools against domestic disinformation, remain key challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-expanding-list-of-sanctioned-propaganda-channels&quot;&gt;An Expanding List of Sanctioned Propaganda Channels&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, the EU has imposed a raft of economic and trade sanctions against Russia. However, the EU also introduced new measures against Russian war propaganda in the third sanctions package on 1 March 2022. The swift adoption of these measures underlined the Council of the EU’s political will to step up efforts against foreign disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial sanctions targeted the English, French, German, and Spanish-language editions of Russian news outlets Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik. Later, the list was expanded by subsequent sanctions packages, and now encompasses 32 outlets, including the news agency RIA Novosti, TV channels Rossiya 24 and Rossiya 1, and the Rossiyskaya Gazeta and Izvestia newspapers. Despite the expanding list, not all Russian channels and media outlets are sanctioned. Several remain fully accessible in the EU, including the state-owned news agency TASS and the daily newspapers Kommersant and Vedomosti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, certain member states, including Lithuania and Estonia went beyond the scope of EU sanctions and banned Russian media outlets that are not listed by the Council Regulation. Elsewhere, European Free Trade Association members Norway and Switzerland, while aligning with virtually all EU sanctions against Russia, decided not to adopt the sanctions on disinformation outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sanctions ban the broadcasting of the listed outlets’ content within the EU, through all possible channels: TV, radio, internet, and mobile phone applications. However, this measure is not a “blanket” sanction against disinformation actors, as it does not prevent the listed outlets from carrying out activities other than broadcasting, such as research and interviews in the EU. These exceptions were highlighted by the Council of the EU as being “consistent with the fundamental rights and freedoms recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights” of the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-curtailing-of-freedom-of-speech&quot;&gt;A Curtailing of Freedom of Speech?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasoning behind the sanctions gained further importance in the context of the sanctions’ criticism by experts and journalists’ associations, including the International Press Institute and the European Federation of Journalists as curtailing the freedom of speech. In its justification of the sanctions, the Council of the EU underlines that the listed media outlets are “under the permanent direct or indirect control of the leadership of the Russian Federation” and were used to “channel propaganda action”, which constitutes “a significant and direct threat to the Union’s public order and security.” Furthermore, the Council also refers to the “essential and instrumental” role of the listed disinformation outlets in the aggression against Ukraine and the destabilisation of neighbouring countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sanctions against disinformation and propaganda outlets were not only criticised, but also legally challenged by RT France. It claimed that the EU had no legal basis for the sanctions and that the sanctions infringed upon the freedom of expression and information. The Court of Justice of the EU upheld the sanctions, highlighting that an interference with freedom of expression can indeed be legal if it respects four conditions: having an EU legal basis, respecting the essence of freedom of expression, meeting an objective of general interest, and posing a proportional limitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court’s reasoning drew attention to the fact that the sanctions are reversible if certain conditions set out by the Council Regulation are met, notably if the Russian aggression against Ukraine ends and the listed outlets “cease to conduct propaganda actions against the Union and its Member States”. The Court also underlined the fact that the sanctions do not ban the listed companies from pursuing activities other than broadcasting within the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implementation-challenges&quot;&gt;Implementation Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While adopted on an EU level, the broadcasting ban is implemented by the EU member states’ national audiovisual regulators, who need to monitor not only TV and radio channels, but also online content across websites, social media platforms, and video-sharing apps. However, the sanctions have consequences reaching beyond the listed channels themselves. According to the European Commission’s “Frequently Asked Questions”, any media outlet or journalist that aims at broadcasting the sanctioned media outlets’ content to the public or “have that effect”, for example by republishing the content of RT verbatim and creating “mirror websites”, commits a breach of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Switzerland, where EU sanctions on disinformation were not adopted, the weekly Die Weltwoche published a verbatim translation of a RT article on 3 April 2025, spreading disinformation about the Russian war crimes committed in Bucha. The article was removed just a few hours after its publication. The case was recently discussed by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which argued that Die Weltwoche’s decision to republish an RT article was in violation of EU sanctions, as Die Weltwoche sees itself as a media outlet for German-speaking audiences in general (not just in Switzerland) and also runs a website with a German domain name, weltwoche.de.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exemplifies the serious implementation challenges faced by European regulators. One challenge is uncovering and fining “mirror websites” of sanctioned Russian outlets. Online tools such as the Information Laundromat can help monitor such behaviour. However, it is up to the member states’ authorities to enforce the sanctions against these actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports have shown that national audio-visual and internet regulators face difficulties in managing the bureaucratic layers of enforcing bans and keeping up with Russian disinformation actors’ circumvention techniques, leading to patchy implementation. Experts also noted that an EU-level harmonisation of sanctions implementation on disinformation actors could help address this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-way-forward-improving-enforcement-and-tackling-the-domestic-front&quot;&gt;The Way Forward: Improving Enforcement and Tackling the Domestic Front&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The circumvention challenge further demonstrates that beyond foreign actors, domestic disinformation channels also pose a threat of spreading war propaganda and disinformation. The European Parliament’s Special Committee on Foreign Interference (INGE)’s report on foreign interference and disinformation also highlighted that “foreign actors’ use of domestic proxies and cooperation with domestic allies blurs the line between foreign and domestic interference”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestic disinformation actors are seen as often more numerous and better-embedded than foreign actors. While the regulation of domestic media actors remains largely a competence of the member states, the European Commission has taken some steps, including by integrating the Code of Practice on Disinformation into the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) earlier this year. However, EU member states need to continue working towards a harmonised approach to tackling harmful disinformation that can have consequences reverberating across the Union. The effectiveness of the EU sanctions against disinformation should also be monitored, allowing the EU to adapt its approach if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, democracies need to balance restrictive measures with considerations for the freedom of speech and invest in societal resilience as well as media literacy. The EU’s reasoning in the case of sanctions against Russian war propaganda demonstrates that it is possible to find an approach that justifies measures and sets out conditions for lifting them, while taking decisive steps against foreign propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more effective enforcement of sanctions against foreign disinformation and stronger action against domestic disinformation channels remain key challenges for the EU. Coordinated action is needed at a time when malign actors aim to sow discord and weaken democracies. It’s time to invest in self-defence against disinformation threats.&lt;/p&gt;

The current emphasis on diplomacy might be better served by less operationally valuable assets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMS Prince of Wales and the Carrier Strike Group (CSG), under Operation Highmast, has now transited the Suez canal as intended. The group, including Norwegian, Canadian and Spanish vessels, will progress on to the Indo-Pacific region. The Royal Navy (RN) press release list of deployment aims includes reaffirming “the UK’s commitment to NATO” and to “maintain international security and prosperity”. The line “international by design” underscores the commitment to an internationally engaged UK. This deployment is part of the UK-France commitment to maintain European presence in the Indo-Pacific through coordinated carrier deployments; the French CSG having returned earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may question the wisdom of such a deployment given the renewed focus on European defence. High-level statements from the USA have led some allies to question the extent to which the US can resource European commitments in a context where China is its pacing challenge. Additionally the US has intimated, including in a speech by the US Defence Secretary at the Shangri-La dialogues, an intent to re-focus on the Indo-Pacific region and a strong preference for Europe to take more responsibility for their own defence rather than trying to support the US further afield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift in US focus coincides with a growing Russian threat in the Atlantic into the early 2030s as it takes delivery of further Yasen class submarines and several Akula class SSNs returning from refit. The RN is preparing to be able to counter Russian incursions from the north through the Bastion Atlantic and, although not an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) asset per se, aircraft carriers will serve to protect other ASW assets from air threat. Additionally, there are assessments that a properly resourced CSG in European waters would be the most valuable maritime contribution to a NATO conflict with Russia in Northern Europe. One might, therefore argue that NATO members should not become more militarily active in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the above, why is the RN, and allies, heading east? The twofold answer is that the UK trades, literally and figuratively, on its international voice and influence and the current moment represents a window of opportunity to showcase elements of a credible strike capability. Threat of conflict in Europe is assessed as being worryingly close but not imminent, leaving an opportunity for wide-ranging deployments like Highmast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While deployment of CSGs to the Indo-Pacific may retain value, future operations will need to be shaped by the prevalent threat and priorities at the time. This commentary examines what those future priorities might be. Its core argument is that, despite the benefits, the current deployment that convers numerous port visits and engagements in support of messaging, the prosperity agenda, and diplomatic outreach may be an unaffordable luxury in a future threat environment. Long-range CSG deployments have an important role to play, but will likely need to be guided by narrower, better-defined objectives. These should favour shorter operations targeting deeper engagement with a smaller group of core partners. The broader engagement tasks of the CSG may need to fall to other force elements, leaving the CSG to respond to the prevalent threat of the day, wherever it is found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deterring-global-russia-expeditionary-activity-in-a-europe-first-world&quot;&gt;Deterring Global Russia: Expeditionary Activity in a Europe First World&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deterrent effect of Highmast in the Pacific vis China is likely limited, a view echoed by the US. The range limitations of the UK’s carrier borne aircraft, present lack of offensive munitions other than Paveway IV and the CSGs presently limited protection against threats such as the DF-17 make operating near the first island chain, an area where even the US Navy would initially struggle, highly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are regional scenarios in which China is not directly involved. Many are arguably closely linked to the Russian threat, which has a more global dimension than is acknowledged by many, who incorrectly dismiss Russia as a regional power. North Korean (DPRK) participation in the conflict in Ukraine has shown the links between Pacific and European security. Despite the limited military might of the European assets compared to those of the US, they can play an important role in areas which impact NATO but are not part of SACEURS area of operations. NATO’s vision for 2030 acknowledges that the Alliance’s defence increasingly has global dimensions and it requires mechanisms and tools to cope with Russia’s global aspirations; Highmast is just such a tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indo-Pacific scenarios directly linked to Russia, not including a Sino-American clash, arguably make European expeditionary capacity, and signalling, of relevance. For example, in a clash on the Korean peninsula initiated by a DPRK that had elements of its military modernised by the Russians, particularly its air defences. Such a scenario would directly impact European security given the peninsula’s importance to many European states’ rearmament plans. While the US has considerable capability in theatre, much of this is likely to be focused on the PRC (which has led, for example, to troop withdrawals from Korea).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, though the US might be drawn into such a crisis, involvement beyond a certain level risks escalation vis China, as seen during the Korean war, in a way less applicable to European capabilities. The South Korean military may be independently capable of matching even an up-gunned North Korea. However, external support, for example in suppression of enemy air defences (SEAD), could be an area where Europe contributes. An expeditionary capability, such as that of the UK and France, could prove itself against a Russian ally in a manner that is additive to European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European presence in the Indo-Pacific deployments may also create uncertainty for Russia. General Gerasimov recently opined that NATO was spreading to the Pacific; while this might be viewed as posturing, concerns are backed with capability. For example, two of the five Yasen class SSGNs built thus far were allocated to the Pacific fleet, along with nuclear torpedo capable submarine Belgorod. As the ability to export hydrocarbons east via the northern sea route becomes more central to Russian economic planning in the next decade, the safety of both civilian and military infrastructure in the Russian far east will become more salient. NATO emerging in Russia’s Pacific rear areas could compel them to commit resources away from Europe, potentially easing the Atlantic threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-importance-of-deployments-to-capability-generation&quot;&gt;The Importance of Deployments to Capability Generation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is generally accepted that Russia will not be ready for conflict with NATO for some years after the culmination of conflict with Ukraine. This window is critical for improving capability and resilience and preparing for possible conflict. There is a naval and defence logic to deploying CSGs at reach. The task is one which stretches both navies and organisations such as PJHQ, forcing a stress test of both naval capacity and Whitehall’s mechanisms for cross-government coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the task group, tactical and operational procedures need to be developed, applied and tested building on lessons relearnt by CSG 21. Highmast is integrating the UK’s F35B Lighting without the US Marine Corps jets of CSG21, and working with accompanying allied ships continues to develop interoperability, a key demonstration of NATOs ability to deploy a coherent force package. Contact with both partner navies such as the Japanese (JMSDF) and competitors such as the PRC also provide opportunities to learn lessons. The deployment offers the opportunity for continued and deeper engagement with the US Navy’s carrier strike capability, building on the achievements of exercises such as Strike Warrior. The deployment is expected to allow the CSG and the UK’s F35B programme to declare Full Operational Capability. In principle, making one of the UK’s flagship capabilities “war ready”. However, in truth, most capability development benefits could be delivered by training in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the UK can gain considerable mutual value from engagement with partners such as the JMSDF. For example, by supporting efforts to generate a STOVL air wing on its Izumo class destroyers. It also allows for leveraging partners’, including the US’s (Indo-Pacific Command), Japan’s and South Korea’s knowledge about the currently state of the art Chinese A2AD bubble which may resemble a future Russian anti-access capability in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if such training/exercising is the aim then the broad remit of Highmast, with multiple disparate visits, is arguably less useful than more focused engagement. Shorter deployments focused on specific exercises with key partners could be more efficient and arguably more operationally relevant. A CSG Pacific deployment might be followed by a JMSDF deployment to Europe where lessons from theatres such as the Baltic Sea, in a littoral environment comparable to the east China Sea, might be shared by both the UK and JEF partners. If the Atlantic Russian threat develops as feared the CSG may be less available for prolonged deployments, and it should be kept ready to respond to threat wherever it is found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;support-to-allies-and-international-commitments-carriers-are-sufficient-but-not-necessary&quot;&gt;Support to Allies and International Commitments: Carriers are Sufficient but not Necessary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The willingness and ability of the CSG to transit though high threat areas such as the Red Sea and Bab El Mandeb demonstrates, and messages, UK resolve. A symbolic and high-profile deployment underscores a wider UK commitment to the Indo-Pacific region. The UK recently recommitted to maintaining a military base in Diego Garcia; it is a key partner in the Five Power Defence Arrangement, (alongside Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand); it maintains a maritime support unit in Singapore (British Defence Singapore Support Unit); and is committed to a number of technological or defence related agreements such as AUKUS, with countries from Oman to Japan. The commitment to Singapore includes an undertaking to: “Collaborate on maritime security issues facing our nations and in the Asia-Pacific region…and to uphold…international maritime law”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK should not be diverted by the spectre of threat from Russia. Damaged relationships are difficult to repair, as the fictional Darcy put it, “my good opinion once lost, is lost forever”. Relationships are a cornerstone of foreign policy, and it makes military sense; maintaining defence linkages, access and influence, is part of the insurance against the unknown security challenges of the future. The UK’s military reputation is something the government actively chooses to leverage. Notably, the CSG deployment in 2021 was reported on by 99 countries and in 252 languages, despite COVID-19 constraints. Countries such as the Philippines have already heralded Highmast as “reinforcing alliances” and “supporting the international order which is currently being attacked…”. Many Pacific nations will be looking to host a visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the future employment of naval assets in support of defence engagement will be informed by resource constraints. While there is value in restating commitment to a rules-based order, China knows it has the advantage of presence where external navies will depart. It has made challenges in the face of a more powerful US and several of its regional neighbours. Therefore, it is unclear that European presence in support of the rules-based order will significantly change China’s risk calculus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, signalling does not require a carrier. Effective signalling depends on the clarity of a message, not necessarily the platform used. For example, the German Navy’s recent transit through the Taiwan strait was viewed as symbolically important, including by Beijing, as were similar transits by French frigates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is some evidence that the deployment of aircraft carriers corresponding with increased diplomatic engagement, it is difficult to isolate this impact from the many other drivers of any states’ foreign policy. Some studies of naval presence suggest that vessels other than carriers, though less useful, can also contribute to presence missions. This will need to be a consideration and balanced against making arguably better operational use of the CSG in response to changing pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current model of a CSG deployment, with large numbers of port visits and extended periods of activity in theatre, may be a model that has served its function. The cost and complexity of a CSG deployment will, in the future, incentivise activity that is more closely linked to core defence roles while broader defence engagement functions can be played by a number of other assets, some of which might be forward deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prosperity-useful-but-not-crucial&quot;&gt;Prosperity: Useful but not Crucial&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, a CSG including an air wing is a powerful tool for potential defence sales. Despite COVID-19, CSG 21 visited 42 nations and hundreds of ambassadors, senior foreign military officers and government ministers were hosted. Defence has been part of the prosperity agenda for years and the planned defence industrial strategy will include drives for international deference sales as it aims to “boost UK exports”. Port visits put the UK and allies at the fore of the host nation psyche even if only for a short time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it must be noted that while CSG deployments can support defence exports they are not critical to them. Many of the UK’s deepest export relationships are in the Gulf and three of the five largest defence exporters in 2025 (Russia, China and Germany) do not regularly deploy carriers further afield (Germany does not have one). While deployments can contribute to defence exports other (less-costly) signalling, such as the high level ministerial visits which often accompany French defence export efforts, can also support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, consideration needs to be given to the value for money. CSG 21 cost £74 million, the equivalent of around 30 complex weapons such as Aster-30 (likely to be in limited supply for some time) and almost twice the cost of integrating a new complex weapon on the carriers’ aircraft (which currently, for example, lack an anti-ship missile).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geopolitical landscape presents challenges for NATO and UK defence. However, the progress of the CSG beyond the Red Sea and into the Indo-Pacific region serves both NATO and UK national interests in the current window of opportunity. The RN can achieve meaningful aims through Indo-Pacific deployments. However, as potential threats grow, future deployments, and the Anglo French CSG rotation, may need consider a closer integration with NATO and the UK’s core strategic aims over abstract ends such as defending values. Shorter deployments and more focused engagement might be a basis for more militarily and strategically sound regional engagement than longer operations with a broad remit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic, legal and trade restrictions imposed on Russia in the wake of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine represent arguably the most sweeping sanctions regime ever implemented. The UK has played a leading role in this international response, sanctioning over 2,000 individuals and entities linked to the Kremlin’s war machine and freezing more than £25 billion of Russian assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet sanctions are only as effective as their enforcement and, in an increasingly globalised and digitised economy, enforcement is complex. Professional enablers register shell companies in offshore jurisdictions and obscure ownership through the use of opaque investment vehicles and cryptocurrencies. Organised crime networks provide covert money laundering services to sanctioned individuals and a shadow fleet of illicit oil tankers maintains Russia’s oil exports in violation of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this ever-shifting cat-and-mouse game, enforcement agencies often find themselves in the dark, a challenge compounded by their lack of resources. The UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) has been taking an increasingly proactive approach to sanctions enforcement, including through collaboration with sanctions authorities in other countries. But where the UK lags behind its US and EU partners is in acknowledging that sometimes the most powerful force multiplier is an insider – someone who can turn on the light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-inside-advantage&quot;&gt;The Inside Advantage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whistleblowers have faced an uphill battle to be recognised as critical sources of intelligence in exposing corporate fraud, money laundering and public corruption. From the Panama Papers to the Danske Bank scandal, insider disclosures have repeatedly succeeded where institutional oversight failed. The unique value of whistleblowers lies in their proximity to the breach – the mid-level manager instructed to ignore red flags, the compliance officer told not to ask too many questions, and the accountant who sees that the numbers do not add up. The potential benefit of this insider knowledge for sanctions evasion investigations is clear, yet progress has been slow. Whistleblowing has long been underutilised as a tool for sanctions enforcement – underdeveloped in law, under protected in practice, and underappreciated in policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A shift in attitudes could be seen in 2022, when the European Commission launched its dedicated whistleblowing tool for sanctions breaches. This platform, which allows anonymous and confidential disclosures, was designed as a channel for insiders to report suspected violations of EU sanctions. However, in the absence of criminal penalties, its impact was limited. This all changed at the end of May, when the EU’s directive introducing minimum criminal penalties for sanctions violations entered force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is no small matter. Until now, sanctions enforcement within the EU has been uneven and fragmented. While the Union collectively agrees on whom to sanction, enforcement has remained the preserve of national authorities. The result has been a patchwork of regimes and even patchier enforcement. Some countries already prosecute sanctions breaches as crimes, others impose only light-touch penalties. In many European countries, sanctions enforcement capacity is weak, political will is limited, and legal ambiguity offers convenient cover. Inconsistencies have created safe havens for sanctions evaders, undermining the credibility of EU foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The criminalisation directive serves two ends. First, it raises the stakes for would-be sanctions violators by increasing the punishment and enhancing deterrence. But second, and perhaps more importantly, it legitimises and empowers the act of whistleblowing. When evading sanctions is categorically a criminal offence, reporting it ceases to be a grey area of corporate or civil compliance, it becomes a duty that is reinforced by the full weight of criminal law. Combined with the protections implemented under the EU Whistleblower Directive, this legal upgrade could transform the EU’s underused sanctions reporting tool into a more active conduit for actionable intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uks-blindspot&quot;&gt;The UK’s Blindspot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criminal offences already exist for breaches of the UK’s sanctions regime. However, historically individuals who report information relating to sanctions evasion were not protected as whistleblowers under the UK’s whistleblowing law, the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (PIDA). The government’s latest policy paper on sanctions implementation and enforcement pledged to rectify this situation and, as promised, an order amending PIDA will come into force at the end of June, ensuring that workers who disclose information relating to financial, transport and certain trade sanctions can qualify for whistleblower protections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one of the critical limitations of PIDA is that it only protects individuals who report misconduct perpetrated by their current or former employer. Sanctions evasion rarely follows that script. Instead, it tends to involve a network of intermediaries, contractors or facilitators with informal ties, who exploit numerous opaque legal and illegal entities spanning multiple jurisdictions. The sanctions whistleblower may uncover one strand of this complex spiderweb, such as the compliance officer who spots falsified end-user certificates or the freight forwarder who is pressured to look the other way. Crucially, the whistleblower will not always work for the entity they wish to expose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining whistleblowing as the protection of employees was appropriate when PIDA was passed over 25 years ago, but it does not represent the 21st century work environment, let alone reflect the complexity of modern sanctions evasion. Even under the newly expanded PIDA, if an individual with information of sanctions evasion does not have the required employment nexus, they may not qualify for protection. This is a glaring blind spot and one that undermines the government’s stated objective in implementing the legislative amendments – to increase whistleblower disclosures. A truly effective system must be broader in scope, extending legal protections to any individual with credible information, regardless of their employment status. The UK needs to do more than tweak an outdated law. It needs to reimagine the contribution whistleblowers could make to sanctions enforcement and develop a legal framework fit for purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;incentivising-information-flows&quot;&gt;Incentivising Information Flows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has long recognised the value of whistleblowers in combating economic crime. The Dodd-Frank Act, passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, implemented robust protections and financial rewards for whistleblowers whose information leads to successful legal action in cases involving securities and commodities fraud. Recent RUSI research found that these reward programmes have not only increased the quantity and quality of information received, but also have a deterrent effect due to increased rates of detection and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the US government expanded the whistleblower reward programme run by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the US Treasury Department, to include violations of its sanctions regime. As a result, anyone with non-public information related to sanctions evasion can report that information and be eligible for a reward. The program has successfully incentivised insiders to come forward with over 270 tips received, many relating to Iran and Russian sanctions evasion. Furthermore, in May the US Department of Justice announced that it was expanding its Corporate Whistleblower Award Pilot Program to include sanctions violations, further entrenching whistleblowers as a key source of US sanctions evasion intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, there has been a long-held antipathy towards paying whistleblowers. Rewards have been seen as having a polluting influence on an act that should be done out of a sense of civic duty. However, this perspective ignores a fundamental reality – that moral motivations alone are rarely sufficient to incentivise corporate insiders to turn whistleblower. Speaking up can have career-ending and life-altering consequences, with whistleblowers often suffering immense professional, personal and psychological harm. Offering rewards is not about commodifying integrity, it is about recognising the cost of coming forward and levelling the playing field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite historic resistance, the tide of UK opinion on whistleblower incentivisation does appear to be turning. Since the RUSI research on rewards was published last year, the Financial Conduct Authority changed its decade-long opposition to paying whistleblowers, the HM Treasury announced it would implement a US-style tax evasion rewards model, and the Serious Fraud Office included whistleblower incentivisation reform as one of its planned outputs for the year 2025-26. If OFSI wanted to follow suit, a well-designed reward programme for sanctions whistleblowers (with proper safeguards, clear reporting channels and adequate resources) could underpin the UK government’s goal “to give sanctions bite”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eyes-on-the-inside&quot;&gt;Eyes on the Inside&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK finds itself at a crossroads. With its reputable financial markets and complex corporate networks, is both a frontline jurisdiction for sanctions enforcement and a backdoor for potential evasion. Ensuring that insiders in banks, law firms, logistics companies and trading houses can report wrongdoing without fear of reprisal could significantly enhance the country’s ability to enforce its sanctions regime – especially against the backdrop of the government’s desire to show leadership on sanctions on the international stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these whistleblowers will not come forward unless they are protected, supported and, where appropriate, financially rewarded. To gain the inside advantage, the UK needs a legal framework that moves sanctions whistleblowers from the margins to the mainstream because, without eyes on the inside, even the most ambitious sanctions regime is blind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2023, Israel imposed a complete siege on Gaza, cutting off water, food, gas, and electricity – a clear act of collective punishment identified in international law as a war crime. While Israel subsequently did begin to allow some of these services, supplies remained severely restricted, with total siege reimposed in areas of IDF operations. Israel reimposed a full blockade on Gaza in the beginning of March 2025 amid tepid Western criticism. Without any food or aid entering the Strip, the population began to starve. Dozens are known to have died from malnutrition, with the true toll likely far higher. Minute quantities of food have begun entering Gaza through the US-Israeli aid agency, but the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation lacks the infrastructure – and the political neutrality – to stave off famine in the Strip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet Israel’s starvation of Gaza should not elicit surprise from international onlookers. Over the course of its twenty-month campaign in Gaza, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has attempted to destroy every facet of life in Gaza, from eradicating infrastructure to mass killings of Palestinians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article argues that starving a population is but a natural extension of IDF efforts in Gaza, while examining the claim that this campaign constitutes “genocide”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-destruction-of-gaza&quot;&gt;The Destruction of Gaza&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Hamas’ presence in civilian areas is used to justify the scale of devastation seen in Gaza, the embedding of combatants within civilian infrastructure and populations is not a new phenomenon, nor does it permit a military free rein to destroy the area in question. Urban warfare against an insurgent force is nearly always a bloody affair, but both sides – especially the military with overwhelming firepower – are strictly constrained in their conduct, particularly when human shields are being used. The IDF has flouted these obligations, engaging in a campaign of disproportionate violence that has systematically destroyed every aspect of Palestinian life in the Strip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;infrastructure&quot;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the technological sophistication of the IDF permits a high degree of precision when desired, using large munitions – most notably 2000-pound bombs – and unguided munitions in a discriminate manner is nearly impossible in such densely populated urban areas. The IDF’s air campaign has used these munitions to great effect, destroying nearly all of Gaza’s civilian infrastructure. Beyond mere collateral damage, education, telecommunications, sewage, electrical, medical, and water infrastructure has been specifically targeted by the IDF. Israeli ground units have engaged in excessive, arbitrary destruction of civilian infrastructure, often with little or no military justification provided. Whole sections of cities have been flattened by airstrikes and demolitions, with the long term cost in lives unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the IDF has repeatedly conducted strikes on civilian refuges and so-called “safe zones”, while hospitals have also come under frequent heavy attack. While protected objects can lose their protected status under certain circumstances, the threshold is high, and the IDF has rarely met the criteria to justify such attacks. Instead, few of the attacks are directed at even ostensibly legal military targets, with the scale of the attacks – alongside IDF statements (see below) – indicating an attempt to render the infrastructure of the Strip unable to support life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;life&quot;&gt;Life&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the first days of the war, the IDF demonstrated a tolerance for massive civilian casualties in Gaza, mainly inflicted via airstrikes. While a degree of civilian fatalities is to be expected in large military operations, it can only be considered permissible under international law if the actions are proportionate and discriminate, along with other considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 7 October 2023, over 54,000 Palestinians have been killed by the IDF, with unknown thousands buried under rubble. One third of these deaths were children. Despite questions about their reliability, these figures have been proven to be credible. Reportedly, according to the IDF’s own figures, civilians accounted for over 80% of those killed since Israel broke the original terms of the ceasefire which operated in Gaza between January and March 2025. In terms of individual strikes, Israel killed at least 126 Palestinian civilians to eliminate a mid-level commander in Jabalia, and frequently kills dozens for low- or mid-level Hamas militants. In their June 2024 operation to rescue four hostages, the IDF killed over 200 Palestinian civilians. The IDF has demonstrated such a high tolerance of Palestinian deaths in both individual strikes and as an overall military campaign that they could only reasonably be considered disproportionate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the killing of large numbers of Palestinian civilians extends beyond accepting a high level of collateral damage, with civilians and specifically protected persons targeted by the IDF. No less than 65 doctors and nurses confirmed treating dozens of Palestinian children for single gunshot wounds to the head or chest – a prima facie case of the deliberate targeting of children. The UN added Israel to its list of states and armed groups that have committed violations against children, joining the ranks of Russia, the SAF and RSF, Daesh, Myanmar, and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israeli soldiers have arbitrarily killed civilians with the use of drones, tanks, rifles, and dogs, according to journalists, local and Western medical personnel, as well as Israeli soldiers themselves. Medical personnel have been killed by the IDF at an unprecedented rate in this conflict, with medical insignia often specifically targeted in such strikes. The IDF has also killed more aid workers, as well as UN workers, than have been killed in any single crisis. According to the International Federation of Journalists – the biggest association for this profession – ten percent of Palestinian media workers and journalists in Gaza were killed over the past year, with many directly targeted by Israeli forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These deaths are marked by a number of mass killings committed by the IDF over the course of the war, including but not limited to the following incidents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In December 2023, the IDF struck the house of the former director of the Abu Yousef Al-Najjar Hospital, destroying the house and killing him and 29 other civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In February 2024, the IDF opened fire on a crowd of Palestinians seeking food from aid trucks, killing 118 civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the Tel al-Sultan attack (also called the Rafah Tent Massacre ) of May 2024, the Israeli Air Force bombed a camp of displaced Palestinians, killing over 40 civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late March 2025, at least fifteen medical workers in clearly marked vehicles were attacked and executed, with their vehicles crushed and dumped alongside the bodies in a mass grave.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these massacres had even the veneer of military utility. Mass graves have been uncovered in a number of areas following the withdrawal of Israeli forces, with some graves containing the bodies of women, old people, and the wounded while other bodies were found “tied and stripped of their clothes”, according to the UN human rights office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;erasure-of-homeland&quot;&gt;Erasure of Homeland&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before Trump’s calls for ethnically cleansing Gaza and recent Israeli efforts to remove its population, Israel had long faced accusations of forced displacement and ethnic cleansing. Throughout the war, the IDF issued mass evacuation orders – at times covering over 80% of the Strip – ostensibly to create “security zones”. These zones, meant to be cleared of enemy combatants, were both unlawful and ineffective, as Hamas repeatedly reconstituted in “cleared” zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evacuation orders, like the October 2023 order for 1.1 million Palestinians to leave northern Gaza cannot be justified by military necessity, instead, reflecting a broader effort to render Gaza unliveable. These orders were deemed impossible to execute safely, extremely disruptive to aid efforts, and inhumane in forcing over a million people into a tiny “humanitarian zone”. Civilians were forced to flee, often multiple times, under threat of being labelled as a combatant and killed. These actions amount to forcible transfer and, when combined with the intentional devastation of the Strip, may constitute ethnic cleansing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the Palestinian people are not entirely expelled from Gaza, the war has seen a systematic erasure of the Strip’s cultural and historical identity. The destruction extends beyond lives and homes, targeting Gaza’s religious, educational, cultural, and historical heritage. The IDF have damaged or destroyed nearly 1,000 mosques, all three active churches, 85% of schools, every university, libraries, cemeteries, museums, and dozens of other historical sites. Attacks on many of these sites did not have any semblance of military necessity, and can only plausibly be viewed as the intentional effort to erase Gaza’s heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-claim-of-genocide&quot;&gt;The Claim of Genocide&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the ongoing case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), genocide scholars, humanitarian NGOS, and international law experts have all described the Israeli campaign as genocidal, with the ongoing starvation of Gaza suggested as the most recent iteration of genocidal acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Israeli actions detailed above align with some of the described acts in the Genocide Convention, such as killing members of the group or inflicting conditions of life intended to bring about its physical destruction. Yet crucially, such actions could only be legally considered genocidal if combined with the intent to destroy a population in whole or in part. Intent is typically the most difficult element to prove when making the case for genocide. Proving intent in the charge of genocide typically requires inference through a careful analysis of state documents, leaks, and the actions themselves, as few genocidaires describe their intent openly. However, this is not true in the case of the Gaza Genocide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intent&quot;&gt;Intent&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 7 October 2023, genocidal statements from many leading members of the Israeli government have been commonplace, with the obvious intent of either dehumanising or blaming the entire population of Gaza, or inciting the destruction of the Strip and/or its population outright. Hundreds of these statements have been documented from Prime Minister Netanyahu (on numerous occasions ), both Ministers of Defence that served in the Israeli cabinet since the start of the current war, Israeli President Herzog, the Minister of Agriculture, the Minister of Heritage, the Minister of Communications, the Energy Minister, the Finance Minister, numerous members of the Knesset, the Israeli ambassador to the UK, dozens of army commanders and soldiers, army spokesperson Hagari, journalists, and other public figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, even if none of these statements are taken at their face value, genocidal intent can be proven in a number of other ways, especially through patterns of conduct. For example, the military objective of killing the civilian leadership, administrators, and law enforcement (besides being illegal under international law) might qualify as genocidal given that the actions would destroy the “fabric” of a protected group. Other notable arguments include the conditions inflicted upon the Palestinian life which are so destructive that Israel would have to know that they would result in the extermination of Palestinians in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recognition of this conflict as genocidal is not new, as international organisations and human rights experts have been warning of potential, imminent, and then ongoing genocide since October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-price-of-inaction&quot;&gt;The Price of Inaction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much attention has understandably fixated on the term “genocide”, the determination of violence as genocide is often a legally technical affair. Designating the war on the Palestinians of Gaza as genocide does carry significance both legally and politically, but legal and humanitarian obligations do not begin or end there. Beyond the argument of genocide, Israel has been committing clear and well-documented war crimes and crimes against humanity for 20 months, while its friendly and allied countries provided diplomatic and material support. For example, the UK, despite its denunciations of Israeli action and suspension of some arms licences, continues exporting arms and providing military support as reconnaissance missions over Gaza. Unless the international community takes meaningful action against Israel, there is no reason to expect that either this violence or the starvation of two million people will end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next steps are clear: governments must immediately suspend all arms sales, military aid, and military cooperation with Israel, impose sanctions, and support the international legal mechanisms investigating these atrocities. Accountability for the perpetrators and abettors will be a necessary step to justice and a critical measure of the international community’s willingness to uphold international humanitarian and criminal law without exception.&lt;/p&gt;

Moscow hence sees no need to end the war, unless it leads to Kyiv’s capitulation on key political issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report examines the impact of Russia’s war-driven defense spending on its economy since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Western sanctions that followed. It first describes Russia’s gradual pivot to military Keynesianism—a state-led macroeconomic approach based on the belief that increased military spending can stimulate the economy—with a focus on key investments in Russian defense spending that have boosted the country’s growth. This includes massive budgetary and extra-budgetary financing allocated to the military industrial complex and personnel recruitment efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the report examines current issues stemming from, or exacerbated by, the war, sanctions, and soaring military expenditures. These include an acute labor shortage, inflation, and a recent slowdown in growth. The report also identifies key future bottlenecks that have the potential to pose significant threats to Russia’s adaptation strategy. These include uncertain oil revenues, a diminished current account, an economic overreliance on China, and a potential credit crisis. The report shows that declining oil prices constitute a major threat to the state budget’s most important revenue source, which might worsen in a global trade war. Russia’s dependence on hard currencies like the dollar and the euro, with only partial “yuanization” of its foreign trade transactions, is another important constraint highlighted in this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report ends with an evaluation of Russia’s ability to keep the economy, war effort, and reconstitution drive afloat for at least another three years under three potential sanctions scenarios: (1) status quo sanctions, (2) partial relief, and (3) sanctions reinforcement. It concludes that under the first scenario—status quo—absent major changes, Russia would be able to sustain its current economic and military model for at least another three years. Under the second scenario—a partial lifting of existing sanctions—Russia’s economic model would likely remain the same, but additional breathing room would ultimately provide Russia with more fiscal space to proceed with speedier military reconstitution efforts in certain areas of its defense industry, impacting Ukrainian and Western security. Under the last scenario—dramatic sanctions expansion and qualitatively strengthened enforcement efforts—Moscow’s existing socioeconomic model may face more serious challenges, constraining its manufacturing capacity and limiting its ability to conduct a long-term war effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, there are three major takeaways from the report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia is muddling through the Western sanctions regime, with its economy impacted but not ruined and its defense industry capable of maintaining the current levels of attrition through the combination of boosted domestic arms production and personnel recruitment efforts in addition to military and economic assistance from third countries. The Kremlin hence sees no immediate need to negotiate an end to the war, unless the terms of the peace deal effectively equal to a Ukrainian capitulation on key political questions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Partial sanctions removal, while potentially increasing the resources available to the Russian war effort, is unlikely to lead to a major restructuring away from Russia’s current economic orientation. Russia will remain committed to supporting its defense industry no matter the domestic tradeoffs required, and Western firms are unlikely to reestablish their position in the Russian market at the scale of their pre-2022 presence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, even if the war in Ukraine ends soon, the Kremlin is likely to maintain its policy of military Keynesianism by continuing to direct significant funds from the federal budget and other non-budgetary sources to the country’s bloated defense industry in order to reconstitute its military. Russian negotiators are unlikely to value sanctions relief alone as a large enough inducement to cease their commitment to further aggression in Ukraine. Western diplomats and supporters of Kyiv’s defense of its sovereignty should be clear-eyed in this regard. Overall, due to valuable combat experience, extensive knowledge about the development of sanctions-evading infrastructure, and an intensive post-war reconstitution drive, Russia will remain a meaningful threat to Western security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the unprecedented number of economic sanctions the West has imposed on Russia, the Russian economy has successfully adapted to the new reality and continues to maintain material support for the country’s war effort. The Kremlin has mitigated the collapse of foreign investment with massive state-led investment into the military industrial complex. Through a combination of technocratic skill, adaptable supply chains, a low debt-to-GDP ratio, critical assistance by China, Iran, and North Korea, among other countries, and most importantly, a consistent flow of energy revenues, Russia’s economy has not collapsed and continues to adjust to sanctions while maintaining its war effort at the current levels of intensity. This has helped Russia adjust to the new status quo, allowing it to support both its war machine and social spending programs at levels that preserve social stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not, however, mean that the Russian economy is not facing any constraints. In recent months, for instance, lavish government spending on the defense industry, combined with generous payouts to soldiers and their families, has reinforced long-term imbalances within Russia’s macroeconomic trajectory, including labor shortages, rising inflation, and a projected economic slowdown. In addition, Russia’s dependency on energy revenues, hard currency, and Chinese imports, among other factors, are also magnified by the ongoing sanctions. But while Russia’s wartime economic adaptation is imperfect and comes at the expense of its long-term development goals (including an overall modernization of the country and retainment of human capital), it appears generally sustainable in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report examines the factors keeping Russia’s economy afloat, along with potential signs of economic stagnation, to reach a better understanding of the structure of the Kremlin’s wartime economy, its strengths and weaknesses, and its potential for military reconstitution. It also explores the sustainability of Russia’s current trajectory, as well as the socioeconomic, defense, and military implications of war- and sanctions-induced constraints. Given that the Western impact on Russia’s economic resilience primarily hinges on sanctions, the report also explores the likely outcomes of the three future sanctions scenarios: (1) existing Western sanctions remain in place, (2) they are partially lifted, or (3) they are reinforced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has greatly benefited from the discussions held within an expert workshop, as well as one-on-one interviews with leading analysts of the Russian economy and defense industry, both in the United States and abroad. These efforts were complemented by extensive desk research, including tracking statements from top Russian state officials, press and data releases from major Russian state agencies and companies, articles from relevant academic and policy journals, and statistical data by major financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report is divided into four parts. The first looks at Russia’s military-economic adaptation via military Keynesianism. The second and third parts analyze existing and future vulnerabilities associated with this model. The fourth and final part presents several scenarios for the Russian wartime economy going forward, depending on the strength of sanctions and concomitant constraints and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-war-driven-defense-spending&quot;&gt;Russia’s War-Driven Defense Spending&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-keynesianism&quot;&gt;Military Keynesianism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key factors contributing to Russia’s ability to successfully adapt to Western-imposed restrictions is a series of state-led macroeconomic policies referred to as “military Keynesianism,” which aims to stimulate the economy by increasing state-led military spending. Since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin has doubled down on domestic arms production and import diversification efforts, poured funds into industries that directly or indirectly contribute to the war, and issued generous payments to Russian soldiers, new recruits, and their families. These measures have put more money in people’s pockets, leading to soaring aggregate demand for both military and civilian services. This has also helped align significant segments of the Russian population with the state’s military objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, comparable policies have boosted economic growth in countries at war or on a war footing, especially in the short term. Some notable examples of countries where increased defense spending contributed to economic growth include the United States, which spent around 8.5 percent of its GDP on defense from 1955 to 1975, accompanied by economic growth of 3.6 percent per year; and Israel, whose military spending between 1967 and 1993 averaged 19.1 percent of the country’s GDP per year, while the average growth of the Israeli economy during that time came in at 4.8 percent. The Soviet Union’s defense spending was roughly 2.5 times higher than that of modern-day Russia, for some time similarly supporting economic growth. While such expenditures, among other factors, ultimately undermined the Soviet economy, it took four decades for this to occur. Therefore, increased military spending alone is unlikely to be the cause of an economic crisis or stagnation, and it should be analyzed within a country’s broader fiscal, financial, sociopolitical, and military contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longer-term economic effects of Moscow’s continued military Keynesianism are uncertain. Some argue that the economic growth achieved at the expense of heavy industry is running out of steam, as evidenced by increased inflationary pressure and stress in the labor market. Skeptics further point to emerging signs of “stagflation”—inflation combined with minimal economic growth—claiming that, as the war has led to rising prices and labor shortages, the economy as a whole will be harmed. Yet with the Central Bank of Russia’s (CBR) key interest rate of 21 percent per annum and an appreciating ruble seemingly causing inflation to decelerate, Russia might be able to achieve a coveted soft landing (see the section on the “inflation tax” below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow’s pivot to military Keynesianism is not simply an opportunistic war adaptation strategy but a long-contemplated policy. After Russia’s 2008 invasion of Georgia revealed profound deficiencies in the Russian army and the 2008–09 financial crisis showcased the vulnerability that came with the country’s dependency on petrodollars, the reformed and modernized defense industry was identified as one of the main alternative sources of economic growth among Russian defense and military elites. In 2012, then–Prime Minister Vladimir Putin personally argued that “the huge resources invested in modernizing Russia’s military-industrial complex and equipping the army shall serve as fuel to feed the engines of modernization of the economy, creating real growth and a situation where government expenditures fund new jobs, support market demand, and facilitate scientific research.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflective of the Kremlin’s commitment to the modernization of the Russian Armed Forces, the Russian defense budget has been allowed to grow faster than the country’s GDP. For instance, between 2005 and 2015, the average annual growth rate of the national defense budget was 7.9 percent, while the average annual growth of GDP was 3.4 percent. However, it was Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine that contributed to an even sharper rise in Russia’s defense spending. Between 2011 and 2021, the defense budget averaged 2.8 trillion rubles ($53 billion) per year. In 2022, it reached 5.51 trillion rubles ($79 billion), and in 2023, it reached 8 trillion rubles ($94 billion). In 2024, defense spending increased even further, exceeding the originally planned 10.4 trillion rubles ($112 billion) for the year and instead climbing to around 13 trillion rubles ($140 billion). Throughout 2024, the Kremlin continuously increased budget expenditures, which in the fourth quarter rose by nearly 30 percent year-on-year. Toward the end of the year, Russia’s Ministry of Finance allocated an extra 1.5 trillion rubles ($16.2 billion) beyond the planned budget, which also included additional military funding, due to “unexpected expenses,” as explained by Finance Minister Anton Siluanov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s military expenditures are reflected in the Federal Budget Law for 2025–27. The first iteration of the law was approved in December 2024. The Russian Finance Ministry has since updated some of the key parameters of the 2025 federal budget—including decreasing total budget revenues and increasing total budget expenditures—and the State Duma is currently in the process of reviewing and approving the proposed amendments. However, Siluanov has stated that, despite the proposed changes, budget priorities are the same, with defense spending set to remain steady. This report, therefore, draws numbers from the first iteration of the federal budget law unless otherwise specified. According to that document, in 2025, Russia plans to spend a record high of 13.5 trillion rubles ($145 billion), or 6.3 percent of its GDP, on national defense (this is viewed as a direct figure for military expenditures). In 2026 and 2027, 12.8 trillion rubles and 13.1 trillion rubles are allocated for this purpose, respectively. An additional 3.5 trillion rubles ($38 billion) will be spent on national security and law enforcement (i.e., on internal security forces) in 2025. Expenditures under this section of the budget are planned to rise to 3.6 trillion rubles and 3.7 trillion rubles in 2026 and 2027, respectively. Total spending for 2025 in these two budgetary chapters—national defense and national security— will be around 17 trillion rubles, or about 40 percent of the total government expenditures now estimated at 42.3 trillion rubles in 2025. Costs under these chapters exceed expenditures on education, healthcare, social policy, and the national economy combined. The same applies to 2026 and 2027 (see Figure 1). Moreover, some analysts believe that a portion of nominally non-defense budget items will likely be used to finance the needs of the defense industry. For instance, some funds from the “national economy” chapter of the budget— such as money spent on transportation, road infrastructure, communications, and computer science, among other items—might constitute defense spending. Defense-related expenditures may also be drawn from the budgetary chapters and subchapters on housing, social support, health, physical culture and sport, and border service, among others. This level of military spending, by some estimates, could in reality total around 15.5 trillion rubles ($167 billion) or 7.2 percent of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-lines-of-defense-spending&quot;&gt;Key Lines of Defense Spending&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 40 percent of the 13.5 trillion rubles allocated to the national defense chapter of the budget in 2025 will be spent on the Russian Armed Forces, with similar estimates provided for the next two years. The armed forces subchapter includes payments for personnel, expenditures connected with most operations and maintenance, and arms purchases. About 57 percent of the money under the national defense chapter will be spent on “other questions of national defense,” and this trend is expected to continue in 2026 and 2027. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute’s Julian Cooper, the “other questions” subchapter is likely “being treated as a reserve for reallocation during the year.” This means that the Kremlin has decided to leave a lot of wiggle room for war-related expenses in the federal budget, contingent upon developments in the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to pinpoint exact spending on specific military efforts because in 2022, the government stopped publishing detailed data on budget execution and expenditures allocated to military operations. It is nonetheless possible to glean from the budget that one of Moscow’s key priorities is military technology production and military research and development (R&amp;amp;D). The government plans to spend around 353 billion rubles ($3.8 billion) on applied R&amp;amp;D under the national defense chapter in 2025, with further increases expected for the next two years. The budget also mentions two state programs through which spending for various aspects of military technology manufacturing and development can be channeled: (1) securing the country’s defense capability, toward which approximately 2.6 trillion rubles ($28 billion) has been allocated in 2025, and (2) developing the defense industrial complex, for which some 8.9 billion rubles ($96 million) has been allotted this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Channeling money toward this effort is critical. Considering that the Kremlin initially envisaged its “special military operation” to be rather short-lived, it was not immediately accompanied by large-scale industrial mobilization as Russian war planners did not expect to lose significant volumes of military equipment in Ukraine. The picture has since changed. According to Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, the manufacturing sector—which includes defense firms working toward fulfilling state contracts for the current war—has been the country’s main growth driver. Similar to Mishustin, economist Natalya Zubarevich, seeking to showcase the significance of defense enterprises in Russia’s economy, has claimed: “When I see how in the previously terribly depressed Kurgan region the manufacturing industry grew by 48 percent in January–July [of 2024], I understand how many additional infantry fighting vehicles Kurganmash built.” Not everything is built from scratch, however. Around 70 percent of the weapons and equipment deployed on the battlefield has reportedly been drawn from Soviet-era stockpiles, which Russia refurbishes before sending to the front. It is unclear for how long Russia can rely on these stockpiles, with some analysts arguing that Soviet-era conventional arms, including artillery and tanks, might be depleted by the end of 2025. According to Western and Ukrainian sources, Russia has lost anywhere from 22,000 (a lower estimate by Oryx) to over 100,000 (a higher estimate by the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces) weapons and pieces of equipment since the start of the war, some of them quite expensive. In December 2024, Ukrainian sources claimed that the total value of Russia’s destroyed military equipment exceeded $79 billion. Ukraine’s most recent unprecedented “Spider’s Web” attack on Russian strategic bombers this June has increased this number by at least another $7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the above claims are true, significant budgetary investments in the manufacturing industry will likely continue in the years to come to build new stockpiles of arms and equipment. Satellite imagery already shows ongoing modernization and expansion efforts at major Russian military factories that produce various weapon parts, ammunition, and industrial chemicals used in small arms and artillery. Significant funds are also directed toward drone production (around 112.1 billion rubles, or $1.2 billion, for 2025–27)—with Russian officials claiming that the domestic drone industry is the least impacted by Western sanctions and Ukrainians asserting that Russia aims to increase its drone production to 500 a day—and the radio-electronics and microelectronics sectors (about 101.4 billion rubles, or $1.1 billion, for 2025–27). Besides these funds, the defense sector will continue benefiting from extra-budgetary resources. For instance, already in January 2025, Russia invested 111 billion rubles ($1.2 billion) from its National Welfare Fund into the state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec. Defense enterprises also receive targeted loans from Russian banks, including Promsvyazbank, to fulfill state contracts. Compared to expensive loans provided at 18–19 percent per annum for non-military purposes, defense firms receive loans in the range of 5–6 percent (see Part III for a more detailed discussion on Russian state-backed subsidized loans).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if the recent past is any indication, the manufacturing sector also faces limitations. Following the 2014 Ukraine crisis, Russia embarked on an import substitution program, with the Kremlin announcing plans to substitute Western components used to build Russian weapons systems with domestic alternatives by 2020. Despite spending about $25 billion pursuing this policy from 2015 to 2018, the government still failed to meet its goals and ultimately extended the deadline to 2025. Therefore, while the money planned to be spent on military technology production and development for 2025–27 represents a significant increase from the initial amounts dedicated to this effort, the ongoing attempts are unlikely to be enough for Russia to achieve full self-sufficiency. Some experts believe that, despite overall military budget growth, payments to Russian forces in Ukraine and their families (detailed below) limit greater investment in the military-industrial complex. Already, the first signs of contraction in Russia’s manufacturing industry are emerging, likely connected with logistical challenges such as delays to rail transportation and labor shortages (discussed in Part II), among other problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, expenditures for foreign arms and technology purchases are likely accounted for in the federal budget for 2025–27, even if the exact amount set aside for this type of spending is not explicitly provided in the document. Russia is expected to continue purchasing weapons and technologies from the three main enablers of its war effort—China, Iran, and North Korea. Russia’s military industrial sector has become critically dependent on Chinese shipments of restricted electronics and other dual-use goods over the past three years. According to Russia sanctions expert Elina Ribakova, Beijing has facilitated Moscow’s export control evasion in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By shipping items made by Chinese companies in China to Russia, which in 2023 accounted for around half of all Russian imports of critical technologies included in the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security’s Common High Priority List (CHPL).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By relying on transshipments to deliver Western-made goods initially sold to China to Russia (This category comprised 18 percent of Russian CHPL imports in 2023).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By sending to Russia items manufactured by Western companies in Chinese factories (This offshore production made up 16 percent of Russian CHPL imports in 2023).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, based on the Kyiv School of Economics’ estimates, in 2023, around 76 percent of battlefield-related deliveries to Russia came from China and Hong Kong, and 90 percent of all restricted high-tech imports were facilitated through Beijing. In 2024, Moscow purchased $115 billion worth of goods from Beijing—72 percent higher than pre-war levels—with the majority of those imports being machinery, electronics, and vehicles (see Part III for more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Russia has reportedly received over 5 million rounds of ammunition and scores of ballistic missiles from North Korea, with Ukrainian army officials suggesting that 60 percent of the artillery and mortar shells deployed by Russian forces in Ukraine in 2024 had come from Pyongyang. According to South Korean intelligence estimates, North Korea could have earned up to $5.5 billion from these arms exports since the start of the war in Ukraine. Additionally, Moscow could pay Pyongyang around $572 million annually for the North Korean troops sent to the front line. Iran has also emerged as an important supporter of Russia’s Ukraine campaign, especially through its speedy shipments of Iranian-made combat drones. In return, Tehran has sought to sign deals on billions of dollars’ worth of Russian military equipment, such as combat aircraft, attack helicopters, and radars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PERSONNEL RECRUITMENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia will spend a sizable portion of its federal budget on personnel recruitment efforts and benefits for veterans and families of the fallen between 2025 and 2027 in order to replenish significant personnel losses, raise the number of soldiers in the Russian military to the planned 1.5 million, and mitigate the social impact of high casualty rates. While it is again difficult to pinpoint the exact amount of funding planned to be spent on this effort from the budget, it will probably remain as significant as it was in recent years. From mid-2023 to mid-2024, authorities reportedly paid at least 3 trillion rubles (around $32 billion or 1.8 percent of Russia’s GDP) to military personnel and their relatives. Over time, given the high casualty rates, with up to 80 percent of new recruits reportedly hired to replace combat losses, the Kremlin has been forced to increase payments to soldiers to boost recruitment levels. In July 2024, Putin signed a decree more than doubling the baseline sign-on bonus from 195,000 rubles ($2,100) to 400,000 rubles ($4,309) for the rest of the year. In the second half of 2024, a total of 48.56 billion rubles ($523 million) from the federal budget was allegedly spent on sign-on bonuses—16.14 billion rubles ($174 million) more than the total for the first half of the year. In addition to the 400,000 ruble federal bonus, new hires also received top-up payments of various amounts from the regions that recruited them, with the total sign-on package per person ranging anywhere from 800,000 rubles ($8,600) for recruits from the poorest regions to more than 2 million rubles ($21,500) for recruits from wealthier or Ukraine-adjacent areas. In addition to sign-on bonuses, throughout 2024, the state-linked fund Defenders of the Fatherland provided payments to the wounded ranging from $1,000–$10,000, depending on the injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering that the average monthly wage in Russia is 86,500 rubles ($932), this recruitment strategy, rooted in hefty financial incentives, has yielded the intended results. Moscow has been able to sufficiently replenish its forces without resorting back to the partial military mobilization it tried in fall 2022, which remains deeply unpopular and has the potential to further disrupt the labor market. Both Russian and Ukrainian sources confirm that Russia fulfilled its recruitment targets in 2024, hiring around 440,000 soldiers. Its goal for 2025 is to sign contracts with another 343,000 soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, while Russia’s current defense spending, officially at 6.3 percent of GDP, (but by some estimates, in reality, totaling 7.2 percent), is below that of the Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War’s peak, it remains double the post-Soviet average. Importantly, even if the war in Ukraine ends soon, the Kremlin will likely stick with the policies of military Keynesianism by continuing to channel money from the federal budget to the bloated defense industry in order to reconstitute its military. According to economist Alexandra Prokopenko, the military “still generates demand, because Russia needs to replenish stockpiles and [pay] people. . . . On a political level, Russia wants to have a strong army ready to act regardless [of] if there is a war somewhere or not . . . so the personnel will be kept in a sense of ‘constant war readiness.’ This constant source of demand will only dry out when stockpiles have been replenished.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;labor-shortage-a-long-standing-problem-exacerbated-by-the-war&quot;&gt;Labor Shortage: A Long-Standing Problem Exacerbated by the War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s technocrats have identified a “labor famine” as the main issue facing the economy. One of its key drivers is the long-term demographic challenge that Russia, like other post-Soviet states, has been grappling with for decades. Back in 2000, Putin warned that Russia risked becoming “an enfeebled nation” due to population decline. Yet Russia’s working-age population has since continued to shrink by several hundred thousand people annually due to low birth rates and unhealthy diet and lifestyle choices, among other factors. By 2021, the worker deficit in Russia was already estimated at 2.2 million people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While other European countries face their own demographic challenges, they benefit from immigration and have not experienced the rapid emigration Russia saw in 2022. The onset of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has significantly exacerbated Russia’s long-term demographic challenge, leading to a chronic labor scarcity inside the Russian market. An important factor in Russia’s labor shortage has been the exodus of younger Russians. Though estimates vary, some 600,000–1 million Russians are said to have left the country in 2022, and while some have since returned, around 400,000–500,000 Russians are still believed to be residing abroad to date. An estimated 80–90 percent of those who left were reportedly under the age of 45. Other sources indicate that, in 2022 alone, the number of workers aged 16–35 fell by 1.33 million, and their share of the labor force was the lowest on record since 1996.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War-related employment also contributes to the labor famine. The expansion of employment in the military industrial complex, war-related logistics, construction, and support services has dramatically impacted the labor pool available to the civilian economy (see Figure 2). In 2022, for instance, around 10 percent of the population in Russia was directly or indirectly connected to the defense industry, and this figure has since only increased. Another important aspect of war-related employment is, of course, a significant number of working-age Russians serving in Ukraine. According to the Russian authorities, 300,000 able-bodied men were conscripted into the Russian military during the “partial mobilization” between September and October 2022; independent Russian investigators have placed this figure at around 527,700. Add to these numbers the men who have volunteered to fight in Ukraine (around 800,000 between 2023 and 2024), as well as the men who have been killed or made unable to work due to their injuries (total Russian casualties in Ukraine are currently estimated at closer to one million), and a clear picture emerges of a Russian labor market facing a drastic cut in supply. In total, somewhere between one to two million laborers are estimated to have functionally left Russia’s productive economy since February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A government crackdown on undocumented migrants following the deadly Crocus City Hall attack in March 2024 led to an outflow of migrant workers, further contributing to the deteriorating workforce. In 2022, around 26,600 migrants were reportedly deported; in 2023, this number increased to 44,200; in 2024, it almost doubled, reaching 80,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these combined factors have led to the unemployment rate’s decline from the past decade’s 5–6 percent average to 2.3–2.4 percent by March 2025. In 2024, the CBR stated that 73 percent of Russian businesses were understaffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demand for workers is particularly high in the defense industry, which now employs over 3.8 million people and has the alleged capacity to increase salaries by 20–60 percent to attract more workers. Russian defense firms are thus better positioned to compete for workers than non-defense firms, which lack the state support provided to their defense-related counterparts. As a result, employee incomes in the defense industrial sector have skyrocketed in a relatively short period of time, while goods have been produced toward the war effort, rather than the real consumer market. In some regions, salaries at defense factories are on average about 40,000 rubles ($500) higher than those in civilian sectors, forcing the latter to increase wages to stay competitive. All of this has led to significant increases in the real wages of Russian workers, particularly at the lower end of the economic ladder. These factors combine to pressure employers to raise revenue and lead to price increases that contribute to Russia’s general inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-inflation-tax-russias-inability-to-bring-domestic-inflation-under-control-shows-a-clear-mismatch-between-supply-and-demand&quot;&gt;The Inflation Tax: Russia’s Inability to Bring Domestic Inflation Under Control Shows a Clear Mismatch Between Supply and Demand&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s market-based economy today is avoiding Soviet-era shortages in goods when demand outstripped supply. However, it instead is experiencing its market-based doppelganger—domestic inflation. Russian annual inflation came in at 10.2 percent in April 2025. From January 2022 to January 2025, Russia’s monthly inflation numbers averaged 9.4 percent, according to public data from the CBR. While Russia’s actual rate of inflation may exceed the CBR’s official estimates, a recent analysis by the Bank of Finland concluded that despite some data irregularities in official Russian economic statistics, there is “no compelling evidence of extensive systematic data manipulation.” For this reason, Russia’s official rate of inflation remains a constructive point of reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s persistent inflation since the onset of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine stems from several structural features within the Russian wartime economy: military Keynesianism and Russia’s chronic labor shortage, described above, and concurrent pressure on the ruble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major contributor to the pressure on the ruble—and thus inflation in Russia—is the elevated cost of key imports, which resulted from the financial sanctions and export controls applied against Russia by the pro-Ukraine international coalition. There is evidence that suppliers who have been exporting to Russia since before 2022 have increased their prices (and, in turn, their profit margins) when selling to Russian buyers, reflecting not only the rise in transport and insurance costs when dealing with the contemporary Russian market, but also the risk these firms face in potentially running afoul of Western sanctions enforcers. By deterring certain suppliers from selling to the Russian market, and by forcing the use of illicit networks to maintain a flow of critical goods and components into the Russian war machine, sanctions have led to Russian importers paying elevated prices for these items, with the added costs passed on to their customers. Russia’s dependence on imports applies downward pressure on the ruble, which in turn pushes inflation upward, further raising the cost of imports and creating a vicious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat inflation, the CBR has cranked up interest rates, which currently stand at 21 percent. However, due to the wild mismatch between fiscal and monetary policy inside Russia, the CBR’s efforts are undercut by the Ministries of Defense and Finance, which continue to lavish subsidies, particularly in the form of preferential loan schemes (discussed in Part III), on sectors of the Russian economy serving the war effort. Additionally, the CBR is seemingly facing continued pressure from business elites who argue that its policies hinder their ability to maintain solvency. While chronic inflation often builds gradually before culminating in a crisis, that concern appears less pressing for Russia today, with official inflation figures far below those in several contemporary upper-level developing economies, such as Turkey and Argentina, that suffer from persistent inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything, the recent slowdown of inflation since its peak in 2022 across a number of indicators in response to high interest rates seems to indicate a soft landing, with the volume of total lending to households and businesses beginning to pull back. Of note is the fact that the Ministry of Finance was actually able to reach its target for first-quarter sovereign debt sales ahead of schedule, indicating that the domestic Russian debt market might be pricing in a rate cut in response to decelerating inflation in the near future. Lastly, as discussed in Part III, the Russian government recently announced changes to the tax code meant to draw additional funds from more profitable Russian companies and the increasingly generous savings accounts offered by Russian banks in an environment of elevated real rates. The Russian monetary authorities’ fight against inflation appears sustainable, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-growth-slowdown-a-sign-of-trouble-to-come&quot;&gt;Russia’s Growth Slowdown: A Sign of Trouble to Come?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, Russian economic growth in the last three years has been primarily driven by state-led investment. Austria’s Raiffeisenbank estimated that government spending directly accounted for one-fifth of Russia’s GDP growth. However, in the early years of the war, civilian sectors also grew, reflecting the increase in the share of final consumption expenditures in the GDP structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That situation might now be changing. Recent evidence suggests that non-military industrial production has stagnated since mid-2023. Meanwhile, Russia’s manufacturing sector, a category that includes defense enterprises fulfilling state contracts, is also slowing down. While in 2024 the manufacturing sector grew by 8.6 percent, in March 2025 it suffered its steepest downturn in nearly three years, with the Purchasing Managers’ Index—an important survey of business executives used to track key economic indicators—falling to 48.2 in March, down from 50.2 in February. In February 2025, Russia’s industrial production growth also hit a two-year low, rising just 0.2 percent year-on-year, a sharp decline from a 2.2 percent increase in the previous month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2025, the CBR lowered its growth predictions for 2025 to 1–2 percent of GDP. The combination of labor constraints, flatlining productivity, and durable inflation, compounded by a slowing growth rate, spiked fears of stagflation in Russia, at least in the country’s nondefense sectors. In a telling admission of concern, in March 2025, President Putin publicly urged his economic managers to not strangle growth in their effort to fight inflation. In early April, Alexander Shokhin, president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, said, “We are clearly heading, as they say, toward ‘zero growth.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, Rosstat reported that Russia’s GDP grew by just 1.4 percent in the first quarter of 2025, the slowest growth since the second quarter of 2023, when the economy began recovering from the 2022 collapse caused by the war and sanctions. However, according to the CBR, after seasonal adjustment, Russia’s GDP actually declined by 1.2 percent in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the previous quarter, although this follows an unusually high base in the fourth quarter of 2024. While Russia faces slowing growth and high inflation, edging toward stagflation, it is too soon to confirm this, as inflation trends remain near the CBR’s target. The slowdown could still be reversed by higher government spending or a lower key rate; conversely, external shocks such as a global slowdown could significantly worsen the situation for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the major factors contributing to Russia’s ongoing economic slowdown are the deliberate effort on the part of monetary authorities to bring down domestic inflation, plus the economy hitting the limits of spending-fueled growth. Importantly, another factor is the decline in export demand most likely driven by a weakening global economic environment as a result of ongoing unpredictability in international trade outlooks, which could be magnified by the continued consolidation of the sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;oil-revenues-and-beyond&quot;&gt;Oil Revenues and Beyond&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, a decline in oil prices may put additional pressure on Russia’s economy. Despite efforts to diversify the economy in recent decades, Russia continues to be strongly dependent on export revenues (estimated at $417.2 billion in 2024). In the past, oil and gas have constituted about half of Russia’s exports, but in recent years their share in the Russian budget has been declining relative to non-hydrocarbon revenues. While oil and gas made up around 50 percent of Russia’s budget revenues between 2011 and 2014, that figure stood at 42 percent in 2022, 30 percent in 2023, and 30 percent again—or 11.13 trillion rubles ($108 billion) —in 2024 (see Figure 3). The decline in the proportion of hydrocarbon revenues is especially noteworthy considering it happened during a time of favorable energy prices, with crude oil prices soaring after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine (see Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several reasons explain this decline. First, the Kremlin deliberately tried to diversify its budget revenues amid multiplying Western restrictions on Russian energy sales, seeing non-oil taxes as the primary funding source for its war in Ukraine. In 2025, the Kremlin anticipates growth in its total tax revenue to trillions of rubles, primarily driven by sales and corporate taxes. Part of that increase should come from forecasted growth in company earnings and individual consumption levels, as well as redirection of extra regional tax revenues to the federal budget. Another portion of the increase is expected to come from the rise in non–oil-and-gas revenues, which have already been growing as a share of the federal budget, from 61 percent in 2019 to 69 percent in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions and other restrictions also played a role in the Kremlin’s shrinking hydrocarbon revenues. About 10 percent of Russia’s budget revenues before 2022 came from Gazprom, the Russian state-controlled energy giant and the world’s largest producer of natural gas, through customs, excise duties, and profit taxes. Growing losses in the European gas market started around the time of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine as a result of the Kremlin’s self-imposed throttling of gas exports to Europe, which used to purchase 39 percent of Russia’s pipeline gas exports, in addition to the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines. In 2023, Gazprom accumulated losses for the first time since 1999, constituting $7.6 billion, and faced another loss of $13.1 billion in 2024. The complete cessation of gas transit through Ukraine since January 2025 will likely lead to an additional loss of approximately $6 billion annually, unless Russia finds ways to redirect these flows to other pipelines or liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals. The dramatic decline in export volume to Europe delivered a blow to the financial condition of Gazprom, which amid its 2024 losses had to start selling off its portfolio of luxury properties and is now facing major restructuring. While the federal budget impact of lost gas revenue is relatively minor, as Energy Markets and Policy Director at the University of Texas at Austin Ben Cahill flags, the greater risk is that the Russian state may need to financially support Gazprom in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the major bulk of Russian budget revenues comes from oil (crude oil and petroleum products) rather than gas revenues. In 2022, the oil sector accounted for 66.5 percent of hydrocarbon revenues, rising to 74.6 percent in 2023 and 77.7 percent in January–September 2024. But Western sanctions on Russia’s oil supplies significantly affected Russia’s budget revenues. For example, the EU embargo on purchases of Russia’s seaborne crude oil and refined oil products imposed at the end of 2022 forced Moscow to redirect export flows of its crude oil and refined products away from Europe and toward Asia, losing revenues in transaction costs. (The added cost of shipping Russian oil from Novorossiysk or Primorsk to India ranges from $10 to $15 per barrel.) Russia’s current crude oil exports, sold primarily to China and India, are subject to the oil price cap restrictions that prevent the use of Western-domiciled support services such as shipping, insurance, reinsurance, and trade finance for commercial trade of Russian crude oil priced above $60 per barrel or petroleum products traded above separate price caps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the two years since the imposition of the price cap, Urals crude has traded at approximately 15 percent below the Brent crude oil benchmark. During this period, Russia is estimated to have lost €14.6 billion in revenue from Urals-grade crude exports. While Russia has found a way around the oil price cap by investing in an uninsured “shadow fleet,” sanctions-enforced discounts to the market oil price have deprived Russia of an estimated 15–20 percent of the oil revenue it would have received absent the sanctions. (Had the price cap worked as originally designed, this figure would have reached 30 percent.) The restrictions imposed by the outgoing Biden administration in January 2025 (so far sustained by the Trump administration), which blocked two major Russian oil producers and sanctioned many of Russia’s shadow fleet vessels, accounting for about 22 percent of Russia’s 2024 seaborne exports, have further deepened the impact. In February 2025, Russia’s monthly fossil fuel export revenues declined by 3 percent month-on-month. A key development was a significant 21 percent drop in oil shipments via shadow fleet tankers compared to January, while oil transported by G7+ owned or insured vessels increased by 15 percent. This shift suggests that the final rounds of the Biden administration sanctions may have had a measurable impact on Russian oil exports, even if Russia is expected to adapt over time unless further enforcement measures are introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s dependence on oil revenues and limited access to hard currencies further undermines its economic resilience. Due to the Western-imposed freeze of the CBR’s foreign currency reserves, the ruble has effectively become a nonconvertible currency with its value highly dependent on Russia’s current account (see below). Drops in hydrocarbon revenues can now lead to pronounced drops in the ruble’s value. The synchronized decline of oil exports and the weakening ruble may at some point force a reduction in imports that the Russian economy increasingly relies on to properly function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the notable reduction in hydrocarbon revenues, oil revenues in particular remain the single most important source of finance for the Russian budget, potentially representing a major vulnerability for the Kremlin. In recent decades, major economic crises in Russia tended to follow a sudden decline in oil prices. For example, various Western constraints and sanctions against the Soviet Union only truly delivered when combined with the collapse of energy prices in the mid-1980s, which crippled the Soviet economy and was among the triggers for the Gorbachev reforms. Low oil prices were also a significant factor in instigating the 1998 economic crisis. Accordingly, the Western effort to reduce the amount of cash at the Kremlin’s disposal can only succeed if more effective measures targeting Russia’s energy revenues are introduced and maintained by the Western coalition. By some estimates, an oil price decline to $30 per barrel would deprive the Russian budget of an amount comparable to all current military expenditures, making the foreign trade balance negative in the context of continuing war and sanctions. This would be critical to shortening the timeframe in which Putin can fund a war of this scale, reducing it from an almost indefinite period to just a few years. Within two to three years, such a decline in oil prices might actually lead the Russian economy to the problems that had been forecast at the onset of the 2022 invasion (such as ruble devaluation and inability to obtain critical imports). Indeed, recent reports indicate that the CBR is deeply concerned about a scenario in which the United States and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) flood the market with oil, similar to the 1980s, potentially triggering a prolonged price collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, however, as energy expert Ben Cahill highlights, this glut is more likely to result from a recession and declining oil demand, rather than a deliberate market flood by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, after U.S. President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2, 2025, fears of a tit-for-tat trade war’s impact on global growth and oil demand sent Brent crude prices tumbling over 20 percent in a week, hitting a four-year low, while Urals crude dropped below $50. Also in April, the International Energy Agency lowered its 2025 oil demand forecast to 730,000 barrels per day, citing economic weakness in China, the primary driver of oil demand growth over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because oil and gas revenues have provided significant fuel for Russia’s war machine, if energy prices continue to decrease—as global energy forecasts for 2025 and 2026 anticipate—Russia will have to find other ways to raise money to maintain high defense spending for its planned military reconstitution. This could be achieved in part by further cuts to other economic sectors, including healthcare, education, and social policy. Another possibility would be to continuously increase corporate and personal income taxes. Moscow could also use its rainy day National Welfare Fund, which is currently worth around 12 trillion rubles ($117 billion), or 5.5 percent of GDP. However, the fund’s holdings of cash and investments that can be easily liquidated declined by 24 percent (to 3.39 trillion rubles, or $39 billion) in early 2025 as compared to the start of last year, and now constitute less than half their value before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, when they stood at 8.8 trillion rubles ($102 billion). The CBR has even flagged existing risks of the fund being completely depleted if, for instance, oil prices collapse in 2025. Finally, the government could also borrow more. In 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates Russia’s general government gross debt to reach 21.4 percent of GDP, which is low by international standards. Rather than borrowing from abroad, the domestic banking system, primarily driven by state-owned banks, could purchase additional government bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides hydrocarbons, significant Russian budget revenues come from exporting coal, iron ore, nonferrous metals (like aluminum and nickel), precious stones, minerals, and fertilizers, as well as agricultural products, wood, machinery, and equipment. In the post-2022 period, revenues from these products helped partially counterbalance the sanctions-induced decline in hydrocarbon revenues. However, many of these exports were also impacted by Western sanctions and declining demand. For example, the sanctions adopted by the European Union in December 2024 targeted a number of Russian ships, including those transporting grain, while U.S. and UK sanctions continued to curb Russian exports of nonferrous metals. As a result, from 2022 to 2024, the share of chemical products and machinery and equipment in Russian exports decreased from 15 to 11 percent; revenues from coal exports fell by 20 percent between 2021 and 2024 and are estimated to decline further in 2025; revenues from grain and fertilizer fell by 11 and 17 percent in 2024 as compared to 2023, respectively; and iron ore and nickel prices fell by 21 and 7 percent between 2023 and 2024. Tariffs, trade tensions, and recession risks are pivotal factors affecting all commodities—including oil and gas, metals, and agriculture. China remains central to global demand across these sectors. Combined with enforcement of oil sanctions, the simultaneous targeting of various Russian exports through additional Western sanctions could severely worsen its economic situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-account&quot;&gt;Current Account&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continued export revenues since 2022 have been Russia’s primary economic shield in the face of war-related hardship and sanctions, with the greatest earnings coming from oil exports. Since commodity sales are typically settled in “hard currencies” like the dollar and the euro, Russia’s continued ability to earn revenue on these products provides a steady flow of hard currencies into the Kremlin’s coffers, allowing it to maintain its elevated level of imports despite the ruble’s de facto nonconvertibility due to sanctions. While inflation makes Russian imports more expensive in ruble terms, it makes the Russian government’s ruble-denominated earnings from exports yielding hard currencies even higher, making it easier for the Kremlin to meet its domestic obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the ruble’s effective nonconvertibility holds its value captive to the continued inflow of hard currencies into the Russian economy. When export revenues in dollars and euros remain robust, the supply of these currencies inside the Russian economy remains stable, as does their value vis-à-vis the ruble. Conversely, when the inflow of these currencies decreases, their supply in Russian currency markets also shrinks, making it difficult to meet the demand from importers and businesses seeking to store their earnings in non-ruble-denominated accounts. The amount of rubles these actors are then willing to pay for hard currencies goes up, thereby pushing the value of the ruble downward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dependency on hard currency is a major vulnerability of the Russian economy. As Russian economist Sergey Aleksashenko remarked during a workshop held by the authors, the specter of a currency crisis is the number-one fear keeping Russian economic policymakers up at night. This very scenario played out in November 2024, when new U.S. sanctions on 52 Russian banks (including Gazprombank) by the outgoing Biden administration led to a precipitous drop in the ruble’s value to its lowest level against the dollar since the immediate aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine in March 2022, with a fall of 7 percent in one day, and the loss of a third of its value compared to summer 2024. While the ruble quickly recovered as Russian banks were able to come up with alternative means of bringing in dollars, this exposed the vulnerability of the Russian wartime economy to a potential balance of payments crisis. Conversely, drops in imports might now send the value of the ruble upward, as occurred in 2022, when there was a spike in oil prices but Russian imports had collapsed in the early days of sanctions (see Figure 5). But a ruble that is too strong can also create problems for the Kremlin in its own right. Given that Russia’s critical oil revenues are denominated in dollars but state spending is priced in rubles, a stronger ruble reduces the effective amount of rubles earned from dollar-denominated oil trades available for state spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-economic-support-to-russia&quot;&gt;Chinese Economic Support to Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the immediate post-invasion period, the curtailing of Russia’s critical trading relationship with Europe threatened its economic stability, as the European Union had been Russia’s most important trading partner, accounting for 37.3 percent of its international trade in goods in 2020. However, China has proved critical in backfilling for Russia’s diminished trade with the West and keeping the Russian defense industry, and broader macroeconomy, afloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese trade has been critical for supporting Russia’s export revenues—in 2024, bilateral trade between the two countries hit $244.8 billion, with Russia serving as China’s top supplier of oil, accounting for nearly 20 percent of China’s crude imports for most of the year. Due to the design of the G7’s oil price cap, Chinese oil purchasers, along with their Indian counterparts, have been able to buy Russian crude on the international market at beneficial prices, encouraging imports. As previously mentioned, international traders have demonstrated a willingness to purchase oil above the price cap by engaging with Russia’s shadow fleet. These transactions have proved a critical source of hard currency for the Russian economy, allowing the country to maintain elevated imports of key technologies needed for its war effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade with China has also proved crucial to Russia’s military goals. Chinese firms have filled the gap left by their Western competitors in the Russian market, providing 53 percent of Russia’s imported goods as of 2023—such as high-tech components and dual-use goods that enable the Russian war machine. While China has denied allegations of supplying lethal aid to the Russian military, statements by high-ranking U.S. officials make clear that Beijing has allowed its producers of military and dual-use goods to approach that red line. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also recently claimed that China supplies Russia with lethal aid, including artillery and gunpowder, and helps manufacture weapons on Russia’s territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important element of the growing trade between China and Russia is the increased use of the Chinese yuan to settle transactions between the countries’ firms. The yuan’s semi-convertible status impedes its usefulness as a currency for international settlements. However, it is increasingly used in Sino-Russian transactions as a substitute for Western currencies, with Russian officials claiming that over 90 percent of Sino-Russian trade has been settled in either rubles or yuan. Yet despite the existence of a yuan-denominated “swap line” between the CBR and the People’s Bank of China, the full “yuanization” of the Russian economy remains far from complete. This is demonstrated first by the disparity in overnight lending rates on yuan-denominated loans inside Russia versus inside China. In Russia, these loans can be far more expensive than in China. If there were greater yuan liquidity in Russia, the interest rates on these loans would align more closely with those in China, where yuan-denominated instruments are the most liquid. Second, signs of stress have manifested themselves within the Russian domestic currency market for yuan-denominated instruments, with major lenders speaking of a yuan liquidity shortage and calling for action by the CBR to relieve the concurrent pressure on the ruble. Both of these data points speak to an incomplete process of yuanization within the Russian economy, which in turn speaks to the continued relevance of both dollars and euros to the maintenance of Russian trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Western policymakers were to somehow reduce Chinese support for Russia, it could deliver a significant blow to Russia’s macroeconomic stability. However, this scenario currently appears unlikely. Both Russian and Chinese leaders have, at least rhetorically, maintained a firm commitment to their “no-limits” partnership in opposition to Western hegemony over the international system. In light of China’s revisionist ambitions, Beijing will seek to support the Kremlin as a means of exerting geopolitical pressure on Europe and the United States. However, China’s banks have typically obeyed Western restrictions on Russia, and they are likely to maintain this stance barring a drastic deterioration of China’s relationship with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;credit-crisis-in-the-making&quot;&gt;Credit Crisis in the Making?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the Russian government’s preferred tools to support elevated defense spending is offering state-backed subsidized loans to companies operating in sectors strategic to the war effort. New legislation passed shortly after the full-scale invasion enabled the government to control war-related lending at major Russian banks, directing them to offer preferential loans—on state-determined terms—to Russian businesses involved in the war effort. Some analysts have estimated that this effort has contributed to a total corporate borrowing binge of over $446 billion. A significant share (roughly half) of these loans, as the argument goes, have funded Russian businesses across 15 industrial sectors providing various goods and services to the defense industry, such as electronics and optical products, chemical products, transport vehicles, and finished metal products, as well as engineering, construction, and information technology services. It remains to be seen whether Russian defense firms and affiliated industries can repay these loans, or if the government will need to assume the financial burden to keep them solvent. Other analysts dispute claims about the scale of these loans, highlighting that the Russian financial system remains stable and capable of covering the costs of these debts if the government needs to step in. Whether Russian state financing takes the form of direct payments or subsidized loan portfolios, the effect remains the same: an ongoing dramatic increase of government-backed spending injected into the Russian economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the individual level, preferential loan schemes preceded Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A preferential mortgage program was initiated during the Covid-19 crisis to help stimulate the Russian economy. However, once Moscow moved on Kyiv in 2022, the government remained hesitant to eliminate the program, for fear that it would contribute to social dissatisfaction. As money flowed to defense sector personnel and their families, they in turn invested their newfound gains into real estate, taking advantage of the preferential mortgage system. With the beneficiaries of the program now making up some of the core constituencies behind the Kremlin’s war effort, the government continued to defer cutting the preferential mortgage scheme, despite the CBR publicly arguing it was one of the main forces counteracting the bank’s interest rate policy to bring down inflation. Ultimately, a compromise was reached, narrowing the scope of borrowers eligible for subsidized mortgage rates. The debate over the mortgage program illuminates a dilemma facing Russia’s economic managers—how to effectively manage inflation while continuing to use elevated defense and social spending to fuel the country’s war effort and maintain domestic political stability. Walking this tightrope could prove difficult if economic conditions in Russia were to dramatically worsen overnight, such as through a collapse in export revenues from stricter sanctions, a shock collapse in global commodity prices, or a general recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the analytical consensus is that Russia’s banking and credit systems appear stable for now. Since the early 2000s, the Kremlin has taken a traditional approach toward the management of its debts. According to the IMF, Russia’s general government gross debt as a percentage of GDP has only risen slightly in recent years, from 18.5 percent in 2022 to 19.5 percent in 2023 and an estimated 20.3 percent in 2024, and then an estimated 21.4 percent in 2025. For comparison, the IMF projects at the time of writing that France’s general government gross debt-to-GDP ratio for 2025 could reach 116.3 percent, with the United States at 122.5 percent, and Italy at 137.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s banking system remains well capitalized, with an estimated half a trillion dollars in retail liabilities as of November 2024. With interest rates at 21 percent and official monthly inflation averaging for most of the war at roughly 9 percent, Russians are incentivized to place their money in interest-bearing accounts, with real returns potentially reaching 11 percent. Total deposits into the Russian banking system were up 70 percent in 2024, with money market funds also increasing in popularity. However, the Russian debt load cannot keep growing infinitely; yields on Russian government 10-year notes had reached nearly 15 percent at the time of writing. Currently, roughly 45–50 percent of outstanding Russian sovereign debt is reported by the government to have been issued with floating interest rates, given the domestic market’s current appetite for such instruments. This means that if the CBR further raises its key rate, the government’s debt load will increase as well. However, if policymakers are ultimately able to get inflation on a downward trajectory and make the decision to start a rate-cutting cycle, Russia’s sovereign debt load will similarly decrease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-iv&quot;&gt;Part IV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenarios&quot;&gt;Scenarios&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, the Russian economy continues to grow, export revenues remain robust, and inflation has not exploded out of control. The Putin regime’s adherence to conventional economic practices in the two decades preceding its full-scale invasion of Ukraine positioned the Russian economy, at least in financial terms, to weather the current pressures. However, as the above discussion has demonstrated, Russia’s economy is heavily exposed to bottlenecks in key sectors and faces constraints—including labor shortages, flatlining productivity, durable inflation, and a slowing growth rate—that may be amplified or alleviated depending on the Western sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has recently discussed the possibility of either lifting or tightening some sanctions on Russia depending on the progress of ceasefire talks. How the West approaches sanctions toward Russia is a critical variable for the Russian economy. This final part of the report thus assesses three different scenarios for Western sanctions and their impact on the Russian economy as well as war and reconstitution efforts. This analysis is based on three assumptions: First, it looks at the immediate time horizon of the next three years. Second, it excludes the likelihood of a major crisis arising from internal factors. Third, it assumes the war will continue at the current level of intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-1-status-quo&quot;&gt;Scenario 1: Status Quo&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the first scenario, in which sanctions remain in place at the present level, the current pattern of Russia’s economic adaptation, described as “growth without development,” is likely to continue. Russia will likely muddle through. The country’s investment climate will remain damaged; the domestic import substitution effort will continue to face capacity constraints and, thus, dependence on foreign imports will linger; problems with replacing aging infrastructure will persist; and little nondefense technological innovation will occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, Russia’s labor productivity growth will remain sluggish, hindered by limited adoption of modern technologies, insufficient investment, and management challenges. The ongoing conflict will further strain resources, diverting potential investments from more productive sectors to support the war effort. This diversion will exacerbate labor shortages, particularly in defense-related industries, and hamper technological advancement, thereby constraining Russia’s capacity to achieve significant productivity gains across its economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absent foreign direct investment, state-led investment will remain the main factor driving economic growth, which is likely to slow down to about 1 percent per year. The Kremlin will still possess multiple sources of revenue to rely on. The banking system is likely to remain well-capitalized, with a steady influx of depositors attracted by high rates, enabling the government to borrow domestically and leverage these resources. The increase in household incomes, driven by a labor shortage and interest earnings from bank deposits, would serve as an additional driver of economic growth, contributing not only to current consumption but also to other industries like construction. Russia can further tap into the savings in the National Welfare Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The budget deficit may continue to increase due to the cumulative effect of the gradual erosion of revenues caused by multiple chokepoints (such as a falling oil price, with the expected average price used in federal budget calculations already revised in a recent budget update from $69.70 to $56 per barrel) and increasing expenses (like the growing price tag of recruiting new “volunteers” to the war) but will remain manageable for the foreseeable future. Indeed, in May, the Finance Ministry reported a 21 percent year-on-year increase in spending, with a record 36.6 percent of the 2025 budget already used in the first four months of the year. Factoring in projected decline in energy revenues, the ministry raised its projected budget deficit in 2025 to 1.7 percent of GDP. Over time, pressure to restore the incomes of pensioners and public sector workers eroded by inflation may lead to a further increase in the budget deficit. According to analyst Alexander Kolyandr, “the size of the Russian deficit will be unpleasant but nothing to write home about. Russia has enough liquidity to borrow domestically.” However, if interest rates in Russia stay at elevated levels, there is a risk that they could further crimp growth in the non-defense economy, where access to preferential financing is more limited. If the Russian economy persists in its slow growth trajectory, however, the likelihood of a CBR rate-cutting cycle will rise, potentially providing some relief even if at the expense of higher inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing labor shortage represents an additional challenge in this scenario. As economist Janis Kluge points out, “For military Keynesianism to be successful, there has to be some degree of unemployment. It is the factor that has driven economic growth in Russia over the past two years.” Such a model allows expansive growth through recruitment of extra labor. Low unemployment levels currently observed in Russia—holding at 2.4 percent—risk accelerating inflation, as expanding production may necessitate the need to pay increasing salaries to attract and retain workers. However, Russian analysts have highlighted additional sources of extra labor that could help fill this gap: (1) Russia has long had a trend of excessive employment, particularly in large corporations, where optimization could free up 1.5–2 million jobs, (2) many “excessive” jobs, including those of security guards, drivers, and low-level bureaucrats, could be eliminated to free up additional labor, and (3) there are also opportunities in reforming Russia’s educational and immigration systems to free up and attract more labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If sanctions remain in place at the current level without additional enforcement, they will be more of a hindrance than a break on the Russian economic machine. For example, although nearly half of Russian defense industry companies are under sanctions, imports for both sanctioned and non-sanctioned enterprises remain roughly equal, despite international restrictions on the supply of materials and components. Absent additional enforcement, the cost of transaction workarounds will likely decrease and become more efficient over time due to ongoing business adaptation. The main effects of new sanctions packages are typically concentrated in the first two to three months, while businesses invest in developing evasion routes and mechanisms, with their impact diminishing over time as companies utilize these strategies and the costs of evasion decrease. Nonetheless, existing sanctions seem to have had a long-term negative impact on Russian businesses’ return on investment in foreign trade, as the same operations now require more capital. (By some assessments, Russian companies spend $10–$30 billion a year on commissions for foreign payments to evade sanctions.) These factors will continue to inflict downward pressure on the Russian economy and budget revenues, as well as accelerate inflation. Mounting inflation, in turn, will become a part of Russia’s “new normal” but will not be a game-changer. A critical risk in this scenario may arise from the deteriorating health of the global economy and global oil demand, due to a slowdown in global trade and a weakening of final demand in advanced economies, which will also impact Russian oil exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the authors’ discussion with Russian economic and defense industry experts, the current status quo would enable Russia to sustain the war for at least the foreseeable three-year horizon for two reasons: (1) Russia has adapted to this reality and is balancing the demands of its war machine with social spending programs to maintain stability (though in real terms, social spending has gone down relative to defense spending), and (2) in terms of direct material costs, the war does not appear to be overly burdensome for Russia. In December 2024, then–U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin argued that over the span of three years, the Kremlin had “squandered more than $200 billion” on war-related expenses. But Russia’s 2025–27 budget, which sets aside at least 39.4 trillion rubles ($424 billion) to be spent on the war in the next three years, suggests that the Kremlin views military spending at around 6–7 percent of GDP as sustainable, and the current budget framework will likely remain stable despite substantial military expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war-related reconstitution in this context is already taking place. Having suffered roughly a million casualties, Russia plans to increase its force to 1.5 million active service members; has started one of the largest rounds of conscription in years, with about 160,000 men between 18 and 30 expected to join the army by July 2025; and continues to recruit around 30,000 soldiers per month for battlefield purposes. The Russian defense industry has also succeeded in manufacturing massive quantities of artillery shells—around 250,000 per month—which may not only meet the current war needs but also put Russia on track toward creating a stockpile three times larger than that of the United States and Europe combined. Moreover, the Russian defense industrial base is expected to build 1,500 tanks, 3,000 armored vehicles, and 200 Iskander ballistic and cruise missiles throughout this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is not clear is the extent to which Russia plans to produce these systems from scratch or rely on its dwindling Soviet-era equipment stockpiles that can be refurbished and sent to the battlefield. For instance, of the 2,100 tanks that were sent to the Russian Armed Forces in 2023, only 210 were new, while the rest represented either modernized or restored Soviet-era variants. Russia has been losing anywhere from 560 to 3,000 items of military equipment per month (based on Oryx and Ukrainian Armed Forces estimates, respectively) since the start of the 2022 war. Yearly equipment losses, therefore, are higher than what the Russian defense industrial base can produce from scratch, especially if the reports about depleting Soviet-era weapons stockpiles are true. According to defense expert Paul Schwartz, the rates of reconstitution will vary depending on weapon systems. It will be increasingly difficult for Russia to produce new and more advanced tanks and armored vehicles in sufficient numbers to offset its losses. Yet Moscow can likely produce modernized tanks in larger numbers provided it has not exhausted its existing stockpiles of Soviet-era systems. Production of advanced weapons, such as high-precision missiles, or much bigger and complex systems, such as warships, will take even longer. But this is where the so-called “axis of upheaval” countries come into play, helping Russia in the areas where its domestic capabilities are constrained. Accordingly, North Korea, Iran, and Belarus will very likely continue their arms deliveries to Russia and China will maintain its shipments of dual-use goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, under the status quo scenario, Russia has a growing army, continues its domestic defense industrial reconstitution drive by favoring mass production of cheaper weapons for the front over innovation, and imports necessary arms and technologies from China, Iran, and North Korea. These circumstances will enable Moscow to continue its war of attrition in Ukraine. According to Paul Schwartz, it would even be within Russia’s current ability to mount a simultaneous operation against a country like Georgia on the scale of the 2008 invasion if it had a pressing need to do so (as evidenced to some extent by Russia’s operations countering the Ukrainian presence in Kursk). While carrying out a smaller-scale military operation in another country would not be easy considering the ongoing fighting in Ukraine, if Russia is able to navigate the status quo, the Kremlin may be able to launch a limited-scale offensive in another theatre if it considered such an operation within its national security interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-2-partial-sanctions-remain&quot;&gt;Scenario 2: Partial Sanctions Remain&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a scenario where the United States engages in either a partial or full removal of sanctions, but other participants of the Western sanctions regime—most importantly the European Union—maintain their sanctions, Russia’s economy would receive much-needed breathing space. However, challenges will remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most likely, the European Union and partners in the G7 would remain committed to keeping their trading relationships with Russia to a minimum and maintaining export bans on critical goods. However, without the United States backing the sanctions, their impact would be curtailed. While the legal authority for U.S. sanctions policy rests on statutes codified by the U.S. Congress, much of the sanctions regime’s actual enforcement depends on the discretion of the president via his political appointees and executive orders, which are easily reversed. Therefore, risks to sanctions enforcement stem not principally from changes in legislation—a slower process within the U.S. political system—but mainly from the discretion of the U.S. executive leadership to consciously remove sanctions or dial down sanctions implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding export controls, Russia is eager for the United States to lift sanctions on the imports of aircraft parts, machinery, and equipment crucial for transport and power generation given the challenges to the country’s civil aviation, transport sector, and manufacturers. While Russia has found ways to substitute for some of these components or import them through alternative channels, those have proven to be both complex and costly. At the moment, the greatest threat to potential sanctions violators is the risk of being cut off from access to the U.S. dollar, the world’s primary reserve currency. If the United States were to remove the threat of secondary sanctions for actors supplying the Russian military industrial complex, Russia’s access to these critical inputs is likely to increase. The European Union would be unable to maintain the same kind of deterrent with the threat of removal from the international euro system, given the more limited role of the euro in international transactions. However, the United States might be hesitant to allow an unimpeded flow of key components and dual-use goods from Western firms via third countries into the Russian economy, for fear of their further transmission into China and other unfriendly states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the long-stated policy preference of the Trump administration for lower international oil prices, the United States could weaken sanctions on Russian oil exports, allowing more Russian oil to reach international consumers, and thereby potentially contributing to lower prices. However, given the White House’s push to expand U.S. LNG sales globally, it is unlikely the administration will fully lift the bans on key technology transfers to Russia’s LNG industry that were imposed under the 2014 sanctions. Sanctions on Arctic LNG 2 and smaller Russian LNG projects have kept large volumes of gas off the market, aiding U.S. LNG exporters. A removal of these sanctions could limit market share for U.S. exporters, especially in Europe. A potential compromise could include the U.S. government turning a blind eye to enforcement of these sanctions, with U.S. energy firms receiving significant stakes in Russian energy projects, for example, in the Arctic. This way, U.S. firms would directly profit from any growth in Russian LNG sales, potentially mitigating concerns out of Washington over direct competition. Apart from sanctions relief, it remains highly uncertain albeit possible that Russia could resume some pipeline gas exports to Europe—most likely through Ukraine if the conflict is resolved. A restart of exports via the Yamal-Europe pipeline or Nord Stream 1 and 2 appears less likely at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s other stated preference is revoking sanctions on some of its major banks and thereby gaining access to international capital markets. For the Kremlin, the latter would be particularly beneficial, given the high costs of domestic borrowing. The easing of financial sanctions would facilitate Russian firms’ ability to repatriate hard currency earnings accumulated in accounts abroad, such as China and India, where Russian oil trade remains robust. Additionally, allowing foreign investment into Russia could help alleviate inflation and pressure on the ruble. Furthermore, if financial sanctions on the CBR were removed, some of Russia’s frozen sovereign bank reserves could be mobilized, opening up an additional key source of hard currency financing for the country’s economy. Yet the lion’s share of the CBR’s assets are within European legal jurisdictions. Importantly, even if there is a slackening of financial sanctions, it is highly likely that Russian banks would maintain their sanctions circumvention infrastructure as a precaution against future sanctions measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, revoking some financial sanctions—or restructuring existing ones—could add to the pressure on the ruble by encouraging large-scale, institutional capital flight out of Russia. While they are imperfect points of comparison, estimates of Russian capital outflows during the 2008 financial crisis stand at $133.6 billion, and estimates from its 2014 economic slump come in at $151.5 billion. With an outflow of this scale during wartime, Russian authorities would have no choice but to institute strong capital controls, which could apply political pressure on the Kremlin as Russian savings denominated in rubles began to dramatically decline in value. However, the CBR would most likely apply not only the stick of capital controls to keep money in the country, but also the carrot of elevated interest rates to incentivize Russian money to stay put. In 2022, the ruble was able to maintain its value and even appreciate after the initial shock of the invasion because Russia’s bumper returns on hydrocarbon exports that year coincided with a collapse of Russian imports as sanctions took immediate effect. In a future scenario, given Russia’s extensive sanctions circumvention infrastructure, this kind of collapse in imports appears unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a scenario of partial sanctions relief, while some Western companies could stand to make sizable profits, the risks would remain significant. A future return of U.S. sanctions could make business operations risky, and any Western assets in Russia would be threatened by seizure or outright nationalization if geopolitics takes a confrontational turn. The Kremlin continues to reward loyalists with the redistribution of assets inside the country, and Western-owned firms will remain ripe targets. That said, if U.S. sanctions on financial transactions were removed or weakened, non-EU corporations would sense an opportunity, with traders of energy and other commodities likely standing to benefit. However, in recent public comments, the leaders of major oil traders who all sold Russian crude before 2022 noted that they would approach a return to full-scale operations in the Russian market with caution. It remains unlikely that major U.S. financial institutions would return to Russia, nor asset-heavy firms whose businesses would require more extensive in-country operations and investments. American consumer firms might be tempted by Russia’s 140 million-strong consumer market, but the reputational risk will remain robust as long as Putin sits in the Kremlin. Depending on the industry, Western companies returning to the Russian market would face competition from local firms likely to be protective of their market share and willing to use their political connections to muscle out foreign rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Russia, reduced competition, emerging market gaps, and protective policies have given rise to a group of businesses that thrive under current conditions—and now fear disruption more than isolation. Certain sectors of the Russian economy, such as the agricultural industry, consumer goods producers, and firms that have tried to invest in import substitution efforts, may feel threatened or jilted by the return of Western competitors. Others took on high-risk loans to adapt to the new conditions and worry that reopening markets would undermine their position. In contrast, some import- and export-dependent businesses could see certain costs lowered and new foreign market opportunities open in the context of partial sanctions relief. But even if there is a partial removal of sanctions, it is unlikely that business in Russia will return to the pre-2022 status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iran experience may be telling. After the completion of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran was granted considerable sanctions relief. However, while Iran expected a return to normal, with Western businesses and financial institutions reverting back to their practices prior to the flurry of Western sanctions, Tehran was left disappointed. Western businesses were very reluctant to go back into the Iranian market. Many Western banks were worried of running afoul of other U.S. laws and were concerned that sanctions could return. In that sense, sanctions relief is not an on/off switch, as Western businesses will inevitably worry about being burned again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capacity of European states to backfill for the United States on sanctions enforcement would be limited but not nonexistent. In May 2025, for instance, the EU—in parallel with the United Kingdom, but notably not the United States—released its seventeenth sanctions package since February 2022, following an unsuccessful conversation between Presidents Trump and Putin over a potential ceasefire agreement in Ukraine. In the event of a partial sanctions lift, the European Union and other G7 countries could thus maintain their own enforcement of sanctions. They are positioned to effectively track vessels traversing the Baltic Sea as part of Russia’s shadow fleet, and limit Russian banks’ access to the Belgium-based SWIFT payment system. Additionally, they could maintain the freeze on over 200 billion euros worth of CBR reserves immobilized in the European Union’s jurisdictions, in addition to those funds frozen in Australian, Japanese, Canadian, and British accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the EU’s ability to preserve the sanctions regime depends on its capacity to sustain regular sanctions extensions by unanimous votes in the European Council. In a partial sanctions lift scenario, Hungary and Slovakia may demand concessions from the EU for their acquiescence or potentially threaten the entire sanctions renewal process, which happens every six months. The EU is currently exploring legal ways to bypass potential Hungarian opposition, and also retains significant financial and political leverage it can use with Budapest and others. After all, the EU has passed 17 sanctions packages since the full-scale invasion and sanctions of some form against Russia have been renewed every six months for the past decade. Moreover, unlike sanctions policy, the EU’s tariff policy is under the full purview of the European Commission, and therefore does not require unanimity among member states to be weaponized against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional calls may emerge from within the EU business community to rebuild trade with Russia. The resumption of Russian gas sales to Europe at their prewar scale, while unlikely at the moment, risks boosting the Kremlin’s revenues to power its war effort and would reload a potent weapon of economic influence that Moscow could aim at European capitals. There is little doubt that German and other European businesses would be eager to receive gas flows from Russia, given higher energy costs are impacting their economic competitiveness. However, such a step would be extremely contentious within the European Union, generating significant opposition from Eastern European leaders and likely EU institutions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, the sanctions regime would be weakened, thereby releasing some of the pressure on the Russian economy. Russian supply chains would be strengthened, enabling a greater inflow of key imports and lowering their cost. This in turn would lessen the pressure on the ruble and Russian inflation. Continued government spending on the war effort combined with Russia’s chronic labor shortage would mean that the inflation challenge would not totally disappear, requiring elevated interest rates for longer. But crucially, a weakening of enforcement of the G7’s oil price cap—which is estimated to have effectively forced Russia to lower the price of its oil by roughly 15 percent—would potentially allow further hard currency flows into the Kremlin’s coffers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra financial breathing space would ultimately leave Russia with more room for maneuver in the prosecution of its war effort in Ukraine. In particular, the defense industry would have more resources to invest in further development and production of those arms and technologies that have proven essential in the Ukraine war, including advanced drones, electronic warfare systems, and precision strike weapons. Furthermore, Russia would have the potential to possibly diversify certain key defense industry supply chains away from their current overexposure to China. However, given Beijing and Moscow’s growing ideological, strategic, and economic alignment, serious decoupling remains unlikely. The defense industry would also accelerate the production of so-called legacy weapons and equipment drawn from Soviet-era reserves, such as tanks and armored vehicles, to replace losses on the battlefield. Russia is also capable of ramping up production of other types of advanced equipment. For example, it now manufactures nearly 300 of its main battle tank, the T-90M, each year (up from about 40 in 2021, before the invasion), according to Western intelligence estimates. Reportedly, almost none are being deployed to the front lines in Ukraine and are instead being held in reserve within Russia for future use. However, it is unclear to what extent a relaxation of certain sanctions would enable Russia to increase the overall manufacturing capacity of weapons and equipment in a way that would leave its armed forces well-supplied in Ukraine while allowing for a concurrent intensive rebuilding and expansion of its stockpiles for future large-scale missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether, while partial sanctions relief would not qualitatively alter Moscow’s military capabilities, due to extra financial breathing space, its war horizon would likely extend even further beyond the next three years, thus challenging Ukrainian and Western security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-3-western-sanctions-become-stronger&quot;&gt;Scenario 3: Western Sanctions Become Stronger&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a scenario where U.S.-led peace talks with Russia and Ukraine stall due to Moscow’s refusal to negotiate in good faith, the strengthening or the broadening of the current sanctions regime remains a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the available measures to strengthen sanctions is lowering the oil price cap. The Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air estimates suggest that a reduced price cap of $30 per barrel would have cut Russia’s oil export revenue by 41 percent from the onset of sanctions in December 2022 through February 2025. However, the struggle to enforce the oil price cap even at $60 makes one doubt the possible effectiveness of such measures at lower levels. To make the price cap more effective, the United States and its allies could implement stricter control over the shadow fleet. This could entail sanctioning additional shadow fleet vessels, which has proved a successful strategy to date, along with prohibiting the sale of tankers to entities likely to employ deceptive tactics. Yet it is increasingly difficult to accurately identify such ships, as they often use automatic identification system blackouts to conceal entry into Russian ports or ship-to-ship transfers at sea and flag hopping (i.e., registering under flags of convenience from countries that are less inclined to enforce Western sanctions and have complicated ownership and management structures in place, enabling the shadow fleet to hide links to Russia). Enhanced naval protection, which would include increasing the number of coast guard personnel monitoring suspicious vessels, could help alleviate this issue, although it would be a resource-intensive approach. In addition to correctly identifying and sanctioning the vessels, detaining members of the crew until appropriate investigations are completed could serve as an extra deterrent against future sanctions evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet more impactful than targeting the shadow fleet would be to threaten and use secondary sanctions. The interviewed experts highlighted the need to broaden the sanctions coalition in order to pressure the largest buyers of Russian oil, such as China and India, to seek alternative suppliers. President Trump’s recent threat to impose secondary tariffs of 25–50 percent on the buyers of Russian oil might be a measure severe enough to force these countries to limit such purchases, if their implementation is workable. India would be in a particularly troublesome position—it has surpassed China to become the biggest purchaser of seaborne (but not total) Russian crude oil, the latter comprising around 35 percent of New Delhi’s total crude imports in 2024. As India is already refusing to buy crude oil from Iran due to U.S. sanctions, being forced to diversify away from Russian oil would likely increase the country’s costs of oil imports. In China’s case, amid the ongoing trade war, the extent of remaining U.S. leverage is less clear. But the heightened economic uncertainty, which may follow a global trade war, may slow global growth and weaken oil demand and prices. This would impact Russia’s economy, given its ongoing dependence on energy exports. Finally, if the White House indeed proceeds with the threatened secondary tariffs, such a drastic measure will also alter the internal dynamics within OPEC+. Any decrease in Russian barrels on global markets would allow the rest of the OPEC+ members to benefit by increasing their own production and exports without lowering prices, but such a decision will also weaken group solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another notable area where sanctions can be expanded or more rigorously reinforced is the current export controls regime on critical technologies essential for Russia’s war effort. There is a reasonable suspicion that certain organizations that remain unsanctioned, such as the Russian state corporation for space activities Roscosmos and state corporation for nuclear energy Rosatom, as well as some civilian entities within Rostec, might be contributing to Russia’s war needs. The interviewed experts also flagged the need for a more effective coordinated enforcement mechanism across the G7 and EU countries for current export controls, analogous to the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), which existed during the Cold War. Enforcement could be strengthened not only by going after intermediaries and financial institutions aiding Moscow’s sanctions circumvention effort in third countries such as China, but also by working with Western producers to implement a more rigorous vetting and tracking mechanism to ensure that Western dual-use technology does not end up in Russia. Such collaboration between Western governments and private firms can create a public-private infrastructure that can be used in the future as well, if similar restrictions are introduced against other countries such as China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, despite the increased costs of dramatic sanctions expansion or qualitatively strengthened enforcement efforts for the sanctions coalition countries, Russia would face significant pain. If Russian energy exports (which in 2024 comprised about 30 percent of its federal budget revenues) are actually reduced via secondary sanctions, and the cost of importing dual-use goods rises for Moscow due to increased export control enforcement, its already slowing economy could face increased pressure on its current account. The strengthened sanctions regime would further exacerbate issues with labor shortages by further decreasing labor productivity—with every new Western sanction, restriction, or enforcement comes a Russian evasion effort, and high-skilled workers in Russian firms would likely spend more time devising new sanctions evasion routes or money settlement schemes. This would increase the operational costs of these firms and require additional members of the Russian workforce to spend their energy on sanctions circumvention, rather than making contributions to Russia’s overall productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war effort in this scenario, therefore, would likely be impacted, as lower oil revenues and a labor shortage could translate into a further contraction in the manufacturing industry, which is critical for maintaining steady levels of weapon flows to the battlefield. Additionally, if export control enforcement is strengthened, Russia’s access to critical technologies from China would also be impaired, further impacting the manufacturing sector. The government might also be forced to decrease payments and limit certain social benefits for soldiers and their families, which would hinder future recruitment and might even lead to a second wave of partial mobilization and ensuing brain drain from the country. Declining compensation for war participation and the worsening economic situation might contribute to growing social tension, as in the case of the Soviet-Afghan war. Meanwhile, Ukraine, through the help of its Western partners, might be able to capitalize on Russian struggles and strengthen its position on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three years of war and sanctions, the Russian economy finds itself battered, but not broken. Despite expectations of its imminent demise, the Russian economy did not collapse in the face of the Western sanctions regime and the strains of wartime mobilization. Rather, the Russian economy adapted, and has so far been able to manage the tradeoffs necessary to fuel its war effort in Ukraine, circumvent Western sanctions, and maintain macroeconomic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has nonetheless faced real challenges. Sanctions have raised the costs of its critical imports, cut down on export revenues, and riskily exposed the economy to a growing dependence on trade with China. Russia’s reliance on turbocharged spending via military Keynesianism has collided with its chronic labor shortage, further fueling a domestic inflationary cycle triggered by the sanctions regime’s attack on Russian supply chains. Russia’s current account remains the country’s most glaring economic vulnerability. A dramatic drop in export revenues, a surge in capital flight, or a further increase in the country’s import costs, if timed fortuitously, could push Russia in the direction of a balance of payments crisis. Lastly, the Russian economy appears to have hit the growth limit of its military spending–dependent model, as existing capacity limits have collided with elevated interest rates to lead to significantly lower growth projections in 2025 and 2026 compared to the growth numbers achieved in 2023 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, at least over the short-to-medium term, Russia faces no signs of internal economic collapse. The country continues to earn valuable hard currency revenues from its commodities exports, and the financial system remains well capitalized, despite a growing (but manageable) debt burden. The Russian government’s economic technocrats and corporate managers continue to facilitate adaptation to the Western sanctions, and the regime’s canny distribution of military funding streams have consolidated the Kremlin’s domestic position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the scenario where the sanctions regime remains as is, Russia will be able to continue its war in Ukraine, at least at the current level of intensity, over the next three years. If there is a partial removal of sanctions, the Russian economy will gain some breathing space and additional resources for its war effort, but the overall macroeconomic position of the country will not radically shift. Lastly, if additional sanctions are added or the enforcement mechanisms of the current sanctions are strengthened, Russian revenues would contract, forcing more tradeoffs in the allocation of spending, and potentially reinforcing Ukraine’s position both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all three of these scenarios, barring unforeseen factors, Russia’s domestic economic position remains constrained but not overwhelmed. In this context, Russian diplomats, while eager for sanctions relief, are unlikely to make major concessions to Ukraine and its partners at the negotiating table based on economic considerations alone. Western governments, whose goal is to support Ukraine’s sovereignty, contain Russian power projection, and ultimately deter further aggression from Moscow, must be clear-eyed in their engagement with a Russian leadership that remains committed to long-term confrontation with the Western-led international order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian economy has lived many lives since February 2022. After the initial shock of the invasion wore off, the country experienced a dramatic sugar high thanks to historic hydrocarbon revenues, and surging government spending. The economy now appears to have entered its post–sugar high hangover, with growth slowing, and its internal reorganization settling down. However, the Russian war economy will most likely continue to lumber along, and prioritize allocating resources to maintain its military position on the Ukrainian front, no matter the cost to the country’s future productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

However, no formal, comprehensive plan for Ukraine’s agricultural recovery exists today after more than three years of protracted conflict.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Black Sea port infrastructure to farmland soils, Russia’s war has negatively impacted all aspects of Ukraine’s agricultural system. Russia has gained significant economic and geopolitical benefits by doing so, including the diminishment of Ukraine’s wartime economy, disruption to EU agricultural markets, and opening of opportunity for Russia to expand its agricultural market share—and influence—in strategic regions. The Kyiv School of Economics and the World Bank’s latest Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment estimates total direct damages to Ukraine’s agriculture sector at $11.2 billion, leading to $72.7 billion in losses since 2022. Reconstruction and recovery will be costly, estimated at $55.5 billion over the next 10 years, but the benefits are numerous: bolstering Ukraine’s economy, strengthening global food security, and countering Russia’s expanding influence in global agriculture markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS’s white paper, “Blueprint for an Agricultural Recovery Plan for Ukraine,” presents the essential elements of an agricultural recovery plan that would position Ukraine’s agriculture sector for a sustainable and economically competitive future in line with EU integration. When a ceasefire is reached, this blueprint could serve as the basis for a formal plan for Ukraine’s agricultural recovery, endorsed by the Ukrainian government and its partners. Absent a ceasefire plan, the blueprint could still help guide investments from Ukraine’s partners in Ukraine’s agriculture sector. The agricultural recovery priorities are organized temporally into urgent (0–1 years), short-term (1–3 years), medium-term (3–5 years), and long-term (5+ years) actions, with the integration of long-term strategic planning into short-term efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FV8lHWN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Framework for an Agricultural Recovery Plan for Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urgent&lt;/strong&gt; measures are recommended for immediate implementation in the next year to restore the basic functioning of Ukraine’s agriculture sector and ensure Ukrainian food exports flow freely to global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Restore production, transportation, storage, and irrigation infrastructure, with considerations for EU standards, predicted climate change impacts, and the war’s effects on Ukraine’s agricultural trade flows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recultivate farmland and develop the land market to attract foreign investment and ensure that farming activities can be resumed safely and profitably.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide and expand financial support for farmers to support the continued function of Ukraine’s agriculture sector and its role in safeguarding global food security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-term&lt;/strong&gt; recommendations emphasize the stabilization and expansion of economic opportunities for both producers and foreign investors in Ukraine’s agriculture sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diversify Ukraine’s export structure and increase the competitiveness of Ukrainian agricultural goods on global markets through an integrated approach to agricultural and international trade, improving upon prewar export infrastructure and trade regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop Ukraine’s agricultural labor force and education programs to preserve the productivity of existing personnel, incentivize employment in agriculture, and prepare new agricultural workers—including veterans, women, and young people—for long-term contributions to the sector’s development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medium-term&lt;/strong&gt; measures center around the development of an agriculture sector that is sustainable, modernized, and competitive in global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strengthen rural agricultural communities through financial support, infrastructure development, and rural entrepreneurship incentives to support Ukraine’s postwar recovery and economic resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop Ukraine’s livestock production to strengthen self-sufficiency in livestock products, better integrate Ukraine’s crop–livestock–food processing value chain, and increase Ukraine’s high-value agricultural exports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term&lt;/strong&gt; recovery measures aim to culminate in the integration of a climate-resilient, modernized agriculture sector into the global agricultural economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integrate Ukraine’s agricultural sector into the European Union in line with requirements for strengthened quality control and regulations, modernized trade infrastructure at EU borders, advanced certification processes for improved market access, and deepened economic and agricultural cooperation with the bloc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adapt Ukraine’s agriculture sector to climate change, as climate risks elevate the need for efficient irrigation and water use systems, a skilled agricultural labor force, and educational and advisory services to integrate practices into Ukraine’s farming system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop Ukraine’s food processing industry to strengthen the country’s capacity to export finished, high-value food products to increase national budget revenue, improve food self-sufficiency, and further strengthen Ukraine’s role as a major global food supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s agricultural recovery is a complex and long-term process requiring multidisciplinary and coordinated approaches. A phased recovery framework should distinguish the four interconnected stages—urgent, short-term, medium-term, and long-term measures—with one cross-cutting priority remaining central: incentivizing foreign investment in Ukraine’s agriculture sector. Despite wartime risks, Ukraine’s agriculture sector continues to demonstrate resilience, reflecting the confidence investors have in its long-term potential. In coordinating recovery efforts around this staged and interconnected framework, Ukraine’s agriculture sector can leverage foreign investment not only to address the war’s consequences but to further Ukrainian agribusiness as one of the most attractive destinations for international investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 significantly disrupted Ukraine’s agriculture sector, which is a pillar of its national economy and a key player in global food trade. It could take years or even decades for Ukraine’s farmland, agricultural infrastructure, logistics routes, agricultural labor force, and agribusiness environment to recover from the destruction suffered throughout the war. This report aims to provide the government of Ukraine and its partners with a sequenced road map for Ukraine’s agricultural recovery that positions the sector for a sustainable and economically competitive future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2014 to 2022, agriculture contributed, on average, 10 percent of Ukraine’s GDP. In 2021, agricultural exports accounted for $27.7 billion, or 41 percent, of Ukraine’s export earnings. Agricultural exports increased as a proportion of total export revenue in 2024—representing over 59 percent—although their actual value decreased to $24.7 billion. Despite damages and losses from the war, Ukraine’s agriculture sector continued to produce and export food products to domestic and foreign markets. In fact, in 2024, Ukraine was the top exporter of sunflower oil and sunflower meal, the third-largest exporter of rapeseed, fourth-largest exporter of corn and walnuts, fifth-largest exporter of barley, and sixth-largest exporter of wheat, soybeans, and poultry to global markets. The restoration of Ukraine’s agriculture sector is not only the foundation for the country’s economic recovery, but also critical for global food security and a promising direction for international cooperation and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, several agencies and organizations have developed strategic plans for Ukraine’s reconstruction, recovery, and transformation. In July 2022, the National Recovery Council’s New Agrarian Policy working group released a Draft Ukraine Recovery Plan. This document proposes a three-stage recovery approach: The first phase (2022) is focused on meeting urgent agricultural needs, the second (2023–25) on structural rebuilding, and the third (2026–32) on growth and modernization. A medium-term perspective is outlined in the Food Security Strategy of Ukraine Until 2030, developed by the Ministry of Economy. The strategy identifies tasks such as ensuring stable access to quality food, increasing domestic production, reducing import dependency, and enhancing the food system’s resilience to crises and external shocks. More wide-ranging road maps like the Ukraine Facility Plan 2024–2027, developed in cooperation with the European Union, outline long-term planning for rural development, EU integration, agricultural demining, the green transition, land governance reform, and digitalization. Other plans, such as the Emergency and Early Recovery Response Plan 2025–2026 from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), focus on meeting the urgent needs of small- and medium-scale producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several sector-specific initiatives also deserve attention, such as the 2024 Action Plans for the Green Recovery and Transformation of the Ukrainian Food Industries, developed with support from the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). This initiative focuses on energy-efficient technologies, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and modernizing the food industry. Additional resources include a white paper from the European Business Association on economic recovery and EU market integration; the CEPA report Resilience, Reconstruction, Recovery: The Path Ahead for Ukraine; the FAO’s 2023 Ukraine: Response Programme; the Centre for Economic Policy Research’s 2022 publication A Blueprint for the Reconstruction of Ukraine; and the National Recovery Council’s 2022 Ukraine’s National Recovery Plan. Together, these documents have suggested comprehensive policy frameworks for rebuilding Ukraine’s agricultural potential that have been taken into consideration by the government of Ukraine. In November 2024, the Cabinet of Ministers approved Ukraine’s Strategy for the Development of Agriculture and Rural Areas through 2030. The comprehensive blueprint put forward in this report aligns with and supports this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since early 2022, the situation in Ukraine has significantly changed, particularly in the agriculture sector. The scale of destruction has intensified due to ongoing hostilities, drastically impacting rural infrastructure, farmland, and production facilities. Logistics chains have been restructured, especially following the blockade of the Black Sea, which disrupted grain exports and access to global markets. At the same time, climate and environmental challenges have become more acute, with growing issues related to droughts, soil degradation, and water scarcity in many regions. These factors have compounded the urgency of Ukraine’s European integration, as aligning with EU standards and mechanisms offers long-term support for agricultural resilience and sustainability. In light of these evolving conditions, the existing recovery and development plans require revisions to better reflect current risks and to ensure the effective reconstruction and modernization of Ukraine’s agri-food system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report builds on recovery and reconstruction plans developed throughout the full-scale war and presents the elements of a comprehensive plan for Ukraine’s agricultural recovery. When a ceasefire is reached, this blueprint could serve as the basis for a formal plan for Ukraine’s agricultural recovery, endorsed by the Ukrainian government and its partners. Absent a ceasefire plan, the blueprint could still help guide investments from Ukraine’s partners in the country’s agriculture sector. Priorities for agricultural investment are organized into four stages: urgent (0–1 years), short term (1–3 years), medium term (3–5 years), and long term (5+ years). Cross-cutting measures are put forward to optimize Ukraine’s agricultural recovery within the country’s overall reconstruction efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;urgent-measures-01-year&quot;&gt;Urgent Measures (0–1 Year)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urgent measures for immediate implementation should focus on restoring the basic functions of Ukraine’s agriculture sector and ensuring Ukraine’s food exports reach global markets. The three priority areas outlined below are (1) restoration of production infrastructure, storage, and logistics, (2) recultivation and security measures for agricultural areas and development of the land market, and (3) financial support for agricultural producers and access to soft loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;restoration-of-production-infrastructure-storage-and-logistics&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Restoration of Production Infrastructure, Storage, and Logistics&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Restoring production and transport infrastructure is the most immediately effective measure to increase productivity, provide continuous supply to domestic and foreign markets, reduce production costs, and increase profitability. Constructing new elevators in regions of growing agricultural production and near land borders and ports will increase storage volumes and product quality, reduce losses, and ensure sufficient ending stocks. Restoring irrigation systems will increase yields and help producers adapt agriculture to climate change. According to some forecasts, after restoring this key infrastructure, production volumes in territories currently under Ukrainian control could increase by 20–30 percent within the first five years following the end of the war. In the long term, agricultural production could return to prewar levels and even exceed them with the implementation of innovative irrigation recovery efforts.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RUockpA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Output and GDP from Agriculture in Ukraine (2021 constant UAH)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of total agricultural production as well as agriculture’s contribution to Ukraine’s GDP decreased by nearly 17 percent from 2021 to 2023 (see Figure 1). A primary driver of this decline is damage to production facilities, infrastructure, and logistics. The World Bank and Kyiv School of Economics’ Fourth Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA4) estimated that as of December 31, 2024, total direct damage to the agriculture sector amounted to $11.2 billion, with machinery and equipment damage accounting for the largest share of total damage (58 percent), followed by storage facility damage (17 percent) and stolen agricultural inputs and outputs (17 percent). As of 2021, 1,355 grain elevators with over 57 million metric tons of storage capacity were available in Ukraine. Approximately 11.4 million metric tons of grain storage capacity were fully destroyed and another 3.3 million metric tons were partially damaged due to the invasion, reducing farmers’ ability to store their crops in proper conditions. Alongside numerous other complications to the sector brought on by the war, damaged facilities, infrastructure, and logistics have contributed approximately $72.7 billion in indirect losses. Indirect losses include the loss to farm income due to foregone or reduced production, lower farm gate prices due to export logistic disruptions, higher farm production costs due to higher input prices, and costs of land recultivation due to contamination from explosives and debris from damaged infrastructure. Ukraine’s irrigation and drainage infrastructure have suffered extensive damages throughout the war, including the Kakhovka Dam collapse and damage to canals, pumps, and reservoirs across the country, severely affecting farmers’ use of irrigation resources. Frequent power outages at pumping stations and high energy prices limiting farmers’ budgets for water resources compound the deterioration of Ukraine’s irrigation and water governance capacity. From 2021 to 2023, operational irrigation fell drastically from 600,000 to 134,000 hectares (ha), weakening agricultural productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damage to transport infrastructure significantly complicates the logistics of internal and external supply of agricultural products and inputs. Approximately 30 percent of Ukraine’s railway infrastructure remains in a damage-repair cycle, according to the RDNA4, and more than 26,000 kilometers of roads and 344 bridges of state, local, or municipal importance have been destroyed. The widespread scale of destruction to transportation infrastructure makes logistics more difficult and expensive, thus reducing farmers’ income and limiting their ability to increase agricultural production. Of the utmost importance for agricultural export logistics is preserving port infrastructure and ensuring uninterrupted port operations. Before the war, as many as 8 million metric tons of agricultural products passed through Ukraine’s Black Sea ports in a given month, with a 2021 monthly average of 5 million metric tons. In 2022, this figure was halved, averaging 2.5 million metric tons per month, following the complete blockade at the beginning of the war and the later resumption of operations of three greater Odesa ports as part of the Black Sea Grain Initiative. The lost Black Sea port capacity was partially compensated for by the Danube River ports, which increased their transshipment from 0.2 million metric tons in 2021 to 1.2 million metric tons in 2022 and a record 2.2 million metric tons after termination of the grain initiative in August 2023, but Ukraine still has not reached prewar export levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the RDNA4, the total recovery and reconstruction needs in the agriculture sector are estimated at $55.5 billion over 10 years (2025–35), including $2.3 million for restoring destroyed grain storage facilities. This estimate includes the reconstruction or replacement of damaged assets as well as debris removal and demolition of damaged property—while accommodating the “build back better” principle, which integrates improvements in energy efficiency, modernization, and sustainability into reconstruction efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restoring transportation and logistics infrastructure has remained a national priority throughout the war. The government of Ukraine and its EU partners have established Solidarity Lanes—road, river, and rail export routes that function as alternatives to maritime export routes, which remain a primary target of Russian attacks—and Ukraine has restored the flow of trade through its Black Sea ports with the Ukrainian Corridor. Together, the Ukrainian Corridor and Danube River cluster shipped 97.2 million metric tons of cargo in 2024, including 60.3 million metric tons of grain. Compared to 2023, general cargo exports increased by 56.8 percent and grain exports increased by 32.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, from 2022 to 2024, over 2,000 kilometers of roads underwent emergency repairs, roughly 326 kilometers of railway tracks were rebuilt, and 115 road bridges were restored using temporary structures. Progress to repair and restore this infrastructure remains fragile, however, as continuous Russian attacks frequently damage and destroy infrastructure across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve irrigation infrastructure, the Ukrainian government introduced new legislation regarding water users’ organizations (WUOs) and the stimulation of hydrotechnical land reclamation. The legislation’s main tasks are aimed at creating a legal framework for the formation and operation of organizations or associations of farmers who use water for land reclamation. The legislation transfers management functions for part of the land reclamation infrastructure facilities to these organizations and creates legal mechanisms for making investments in the existing land reclamation infrastructure. As of January 2025, 54 WUOs were registered, 22 of them in 2024 alone, indicating that reform in the field of hydrotechnical land reclamation is gaining momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to support agricultural production in Ukraine and ensure national and global food security during the ongoing war, the Ukrainian government collaborated with international partners on a number of rapid measures, among them providing farmers with plastic grain bags (sleeves) as a temporary solution for storing harvest. In 2022, Agriculture Growing Rural Opportunities Activity (AGRO) from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided Ukrainian farmers with 7,800 sleeves, capable of storing a total of 1.5 million metric tons of grain, along with equipment for packing grain into sleeves (29 grain packing machines and 30 hoppers) and 36 modular grain storage facilities. In 2024, USAID’s Harvest Program and the FAO announced they would distribute another 7,000 plastic grain bags, which could store 1.4 million metric tons of grain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, where possible, work was carried out to repair damaged elevators, increase the capacity of existing ones, and build new ones. During the first two years of the war, Ukraine’s elevator capacity increased by 2 million metric tons, including approximately 65 new or upgraded facilities. In addition, several new transshipment terminals recently built along Ukraine’s border with EU countries (e.g., the Vadul-Syret terminal in Chernivtsi Oblast, the Chornotisiv terminal in Zakarpattia Oblast, and the Mostyska dry port in Lviv Oblast) provide additional storage capacities and alternative logistics. The Howard Buffett Foundation and other investors supported this initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restoring production infrastructure, storage, and logistics must remain a priority even as the war continues. Beyond support already provided, further restoration of production and transport infrastructure based on the “build back better” principle would ensure an increase in agricultural production, uninterrupted supply to domestic and foreign markets, reduction in production costs, and an increase in profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Construct new grain elevators.&lt;/strong&gt; More grain elevators in regions of growing agricultural production and near land borders and ports will increase storage volumes and help improve product quality, reduce losses, ensure sufficient ending stocks, and improve export logistics for agricultural products. Due to the increase in production of certain crops in relatively safe regions, changes in crop rotations, a shift to oilseeds, and the potential expansion of processing, as well as the redirection of export routes, the strategic location of grain and oil storage facilities is particularly important.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redesign transportation networks.&lt;/strong&gt; Although transportation infrastructure is an indirect component of the agriculture sector, it is critical for agricultural sustainability. To ensure a reliable supply of agricultural inputs, affected transport networks will have to be redesigned not only in accordance with EU standards and climate change requirements, but also in a way that reflects the movement of people and industries since Russia’s invasion. In parallel, the transportation sector will require profound reforms, including port governance improvements, railway restructuring, and concessions of highways that will attract private investment. Although the transportation sector of Ukraine has undergone an organizational transformation and administrative functions have been transferred from the government to sectoral executive bodies, state agencies, and private enterprises, the framework of public-private partnership and regulation of the legal status of transportation lands and facilities require further improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restore irrigation systems.&lt;/strong&gt; The creation of WUOs in different regions of Ukraine, especially in the south, opens an opportunity for attracting investments for the modernization, renovation, and enhancement of irrigation systems to increase yields and adapt to climate change. The use of low-pressure sprinkler systems with electric trolley drives, drip irrigation systems, closed-type networks for water delivery, and other modern technologies will reduce the use of irrigation water and electricity for its supply. Sustainable agriculture production through improvement of local small irrigation systems is an important way to compensate for the production losses of the occupied and frontline areas where irrigation is no longer possible due to the destruction of irrigation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recultivation-and-security-measures-for-agricultural-areas-and-development-of-the-land-market&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recultivation and Security Measures for Agricultural Areas and Development of the Land Market&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The sustainable recovery of Ukraine’s agriculture sector depends on land demining, environmental restoration, and land market development. The large-scale contamination of farmland with mines and unexploded ordnance remains a major challenge, affecting 25 percent of Ukraine’s territory and requiring extensive clearance efforts. Government initiatives aim to reduce demining costs, accelerate land restoration, and support farmers in resuming agricultural activities. Simultaneously, expansion of Ukraine’s land market is facilitating investment and infrastructure reconstruction in war-affected regions. Strengthening international cooperation, securing additional financial resources, and integrating advanced technologies will be essential for restoring agricultural productivity, ensuring food security, and promoting long-term economic stability.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is known as a breadbasket due to its wealth of fertile black soil, which has long supported high levels of agricultural productivity. Since gaining independence, Ukraine has undergone significant reforms in land governance, including a moratorium on the sale of agricultural land that lasted for nearly two decades. In 2021, the official opening of the land market allowed private individuals to buy and sell farmland under regulated conditions. This marked a crucial step toward attracting investment, improving land use efficiency, and aligning Ukraine’s agriculture sector with European market standards. Even despite the ongoing war, the land market continues to function and remains a vital component of the agriculture sector’s future development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion, however, has imposed significant physical and chemical damage to Ukraine’s agricultural land. Approximately 25 percent of Ukraine’s total territory—156,000 square kilometers—is potentially contaminated with landmines and unexploded ordnance, posing serious risks to agricultural production and farmers’ safety. Beyond severe humanitarian consequences, explosive hazards have significantly limited the use of potentially contaminated land, hindering agricultural activity and slowing Ukraine’s broader economic recovery. For example, in Kharkiv Oblast, which was partially occupied, nearly half of all farmland remains contaminated, severely straining local agricultural producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic consequences are substantial. Ukraine’s annual GDP losses from this contamination exceed $11 billion, or about 5.6 percent of its national GDP. By the beginning of 2025, more than 7,500 environmental violations had been documented, causing estimated damages of approximately $87 billion. Despite these extensive challenges, Ukraine’s agriculture sector remains a cornerstone of national economic stability and global food security. Therefore, effective land monitoring, demining, and restoration of agricultural lands are critical tasks for ensuring food system stability, supporting economic recovery, and fostering international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian government, in collaboration with international partners, is implementing large-scale programs aimed at humanitarian demining, environmental monitoring, and land market development. Since 2024, a state compensation program has supported farmers engaged in agricultural land demining. This program covers 100 percent of planned demining costs and reimburses 80 percent of expenses for already cleared land, provided the required documentation is submitted. In 2024, the Ukrainian government allocated over $13.5 million for this initiative, and an additional $27 million is budgeted for 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is conducting extensive humanitarian demining operations in cooperation with international organizations (HALO Trust, Danish Demining Group, Swiss Foundation for Mine Action, Demining Solutions, and others) to mitigate the risks posed by explosive remnants of war and to facilitate the rehabilitation of agricultural and residential areas. As of 2025, the estimated cost of demining war-affected territories in Ukraine stands at approximately $29.8 billion. Achieving full demining would also require the deployment of more than 10,000 trained specialists. These operations are supported by advanced detection technologies, specialized equipment, and highly trained manual demining teams. Simultaneously, organizations such as the FAO, the Sokolovsky Institute of Soil Science and Agrochemistry, and the Howard Buffett Foundation, among others, are helping to conduct environmental assessments in Ukraine. These initiatives evaluate contamination impacts, inform land reclamation strategies, and ensure the safe and productive reintegration of cleared areas into agricultural and economic use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond demining, land market reform remains a key priority, as the absence of a transparent and functional land market has long hindered investment, modernization, and financial access for farmers in Ukraine. In the context of postwar recovery, a fully operational land market will be essential for boosting agricultural productivity, revitalizing rural areas, and ensuring food security. Between the land market’s opening in 2021 and the end of 2023, private individuals completed nearly 250,000 land transactions. During its first year of operation from July 2021 to July 2022, the State Land Cadastre recorded over 200,000 land sale, and sustained demand for land resources has been demonstrated since the land market’s opening. In January 2024, legal entities were granted the right to purchase agricultural land and foster investment in the reconstruction and development of war-affected territories. Land transactions increased further as a result, and by February 2025, the total number of transactions had increased to more than 396,400, covering 877,805 ha. These figures reflect growing trust in the land market, as transparent land ownership attracts investment, enables credit access, and drives agricultural modernization—supporting recovery and rural development and aligning land values with European levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the ongoing war, Ukraine’s land market continues to function, contributing to economic development and providing new opportunities for farmers. The introduction of the Prozorro electronic auction system has ensured transparency and competitiveness in land transactions, representing a crucial step in combating illicit practices in the market. Despite the challenges posed by the war, agricultural land prices have increased by 30 percent since the market’s launch, reflecting the sector’s high adaptability. However, regional disparities in land prices remain significant due to both economic and security factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The further recovery of Ukraine’s agricultural land requires the expansion of government policy measures and enhanced international support. Key priorities include increasing funding for demining programs, expanding international assistance, and developing the land market to improve agricultural productivity and economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand humanitarian demining efforts.&lt;/strong&gt; International support remains critically important for accelerating humanitarian demining in Ukraine, particularly through the provision of modern technologies such as drones, robotic systems, and specialized armored equipment that enhance the safety and effectiveness of operations. Given the large-scale contamination of agricultural land, additional investment is needed in demining infrastructure, specialist training, and technical capacity building. To ensure quality and accountability, the Ukrainian government must reform the certification system for demining operators, establish clear safety standards, and provide protections preventing certified deminers from being mobilized to the front line. Close collaboration with international partners will support the adoption of best practices, including the use of geospatial technologies and AI-based systems to more accurately detect hazardous areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide financial support to affected farmers.&lt;/strong&gt; The Ukrainian government has already allocated $81 million to compensate farmers engaged in humanitarian demining of agricultural land, aiming to reduce financial burdens and accelerate the restoration of safe agricultural production. Expanding financial support programs for farmers affected by land contamination is essential to help them resume operations without bearing unsustainable financial burdens. Such assistance should be closely coordinated with demining efforts to ensure timely land access and enable investments in recovery and future productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attracting foreign investment into the land market.&lt;/strong&gt; In the context of postwar recovery, the Ukrainian government should consider the potential benefits of opening the agricultural land market to foreign investors (with the exception of citizens and entities from aggressor states). This issue extends beyond land valuation, as the presence of international investors would contribute not only financial capital but also managerial expertise and advanced agricultural technologies. A crucial aspect of such a policy shift is that foreign investors could serve as strategic advocates for Ukraine in their respective countries, strengthening international support and countering geopolitical threats. The integration of foreign capital into the agricultural land market could generate multifaceted advantages, fostering economic revitalization and strengthening Ukraine’s integration into global agricultural and financial systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legalize land ownership and incentivize investment.&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, over 3.3 million ha of land is cultivated by companies with foreign investment under long-term lease agreements, effectively creating a quasi-ownership market. The formalization of such relations through legislative amendments would enable foreign investors to secure property rights, thereby incentivizing long-term capital inflows essential for the reconstruction and modernization of Ukraine’s agriculture sector. Moreover, introducing foreign ownership rights while maintaining regulatory safeguards could enhance land market competitiveness, attract strategic investments in agri-food processing and infrastructure, and contribute to the overall resilience of the national economy. Given the country’s substantial war-related losses and its growing need for investment, further government policy interventions aimed at facilitating foreign participation in the land market could play a decisive role in ensuring the sustainable recovery of Ukraine’s agriculture sector. Meanwhile, the continued implementation of government programs and international support remain crucial for environmental monitoring, demining, and land market development, ensuring the recovery of Ukraine’s agriculture sector, food security, and economic growth. Strengthening institutional frameworks for land governance and promoting investment-friendly policies will contribute to the sustainable development of rural areas, fostering long-term resilience and economic revitalization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;financial-support-for-agricultural-producers-and-access-to-soft-loans&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Financial Support for Agricultural Producers and Access to Soft Loans&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Financial stability and access to affordable credit are critical for the resilience and modernization of Ukraine’s agriculture sector. Wartime disruptions have significantly impacted small- and medium-sized enterprises, increasing production costs and limiting access to essential financial resources. Government programs such as the Affordable Loans 5-7-9 initiative and the Partial Credit Guarantee Fund for Agriculture have played a crucial role in providing financial assistance for operational costs, land purchases, and equipment modernization. Further expansion of preferential financing, flexible loan mechanisms, and financial advisory support will be essential for ensuring long-term stability, encouraging innovation, and enhancing Ukraine’s agricultural competitiveness.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has created unprecedented challenges for agricultural producers, disrupting supply chains, increasing production costs, and limiting access to essential resources. Small- and medium-sized agricultural enterprises have been particularly affected. In addition to damaged land, destroyed assets, and increased prices for inputs, agricultural enterprises are facing financial constraints, particularly limited access to the credit resources they need to maintain operational activities during the war. The high cost of loans and inflation risks further complicate their ability to invest in development, modernize equipment, and implement innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the initial stage of the war, many agricultural producers faced significant difficulties in marketing their harvested products due to the collapse of domestic demand and the disruption of export channels. This resulted in substantial income losses and created uncertainty regarding future planting campaigns. Additionally, the costs of fuel, crop protection products, and fertilizers increased significantly, while logistical challenges—caused by damaged infrastructure and the blockade of maritime routes—further complicated the transportation of agricultural goods to both domestic and international consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these hardships, many farmers actively supported Ukraine’s armed forces by supplying food and assisting with technical operations for defense needs. In several communities, agricultural enterprises played a crucial role in clearing roads, restoring electricity supply, and supporting essential local services. As a result, the agriculture sector became not only an economic but also a social pillar of rural territories during the early stages of the war. However, these additional burdens, along with direct war-related damages, significantly undermined their agricultural and production capacities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support agricultural producers in Ukraine, the Ukrainian government has introduced several financial programs to facilitate access to credit and improve the financial sustainability of agribusinesses. One of the key initiatives is the Affordable Loans 5-7-9 program, which provides micro and small enterprises, including farmers, with simplified access to bank loans. In 2024, the conditions of this program were revised: The maximum loan amount for working capital replenishment was limited to $140,000, while the limit for processing industry enterprises and investment projects remained at over $4 million, supporting modernization and agribusiness expansion. Under this program, agricultural producers can receive loans of up to $1.4 million for a period of three to five years, depending on the financing objectives, at preferential interest rates ranging from 5 percent to 9 percent per annum. As of early 2025, a total of 33,306 loan agreements had been signed under this program, amounting to $3.5 billion, with $900,000 specifically allocated to support agricultural producers, allowing them to sustain operations and invest in modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another significant government initiative is the Partial Credit Guarantee Fund for Agriculture, which was established in 2022 to provide financial guarantees for farmers cultivating up to 500 ha of land. The fund collaborates with banks that provide credit to farmers and guarantees the coverage of 50 percent of loan obligations. Borrowers can obtain working capital loans for up to three years, investment loans for up to seven years, and land purchase loans for up to ten years, with a maximum loan amount of $810,000 per borrower. The fund also conducts consultative meetings with farmers on financing conditions and business planning. These measures are crucial for ensuring the financial stability of the agriculture sector, particularly for small- and medium-sized farms struggling to secure traditional bank loans. Through these financial support initiatives, the Ukrainian government aims to enhance the competitiveness of the agriculture sector, enabling small- and medium-sized enterprises to overcome economic challenges, invest in new technologies, and maintain stable production despite wartime constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring sustainable financing for agricultural producers and expanding access to preferential loans remains a strategic priority for the long-term development of Ukraine’s agriculture sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand access to preferential financing.&lt;/strong&gt; A key direction for future policy initiatives should be broadening access to preferential financing for a wider range of farmers, particularly through improvements and adaptations of the Affordable Loans 5-7-9 program. Alternative financing methods that are successfully used in the United States and European Union, such as agricultural credit unions and contract farming (with processing enterprises and supermarkets), can also play an important role.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance loan program conditions.&lt;/strong&gt; Improving the conditions of loan programs is an important factor in supporting agricultural producers during wartime and post-war recovery. In particular, the government should consider further enhancement of the Affordable Loans 5-7-9 program, including lower interest rates and revised repayment schedules, to contribute to strengthening the financial resilience of the agriculture sector and its capacity to invest in development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen advisory services and financial literacy.&lt;/strong&gt; Strengthening advisory services and expanding financial literacy initiatives like the Partial Credit Guarantee Fund for Agriculture will increase the ability of small- and medium-sized agricultural producers to access credit resources on favorable terms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote agricultural insurance and international training.&lt;/strong&gt; Beyond credit programs, the development of agricultural insurance schemes and the integration of international training initiatives aimed at enhancing farmers’ financial literacy will play an important role in ensuring the long-term stability and competitiveness of Ukraine’s agriculture sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;short-term-measures-13-years&quot;&gt;Short-Term Measures (1–3 Years)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short-term measures should focus on ensuring Ukraine’s stability and expanding economic opportunities in the agriculture sector. The two priority areas outlined below are (1) export support and market diversification and (2) development of human resources and education in the agriculture sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;export-support-and-market-diversification&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Export Support and Market Diversification&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The restoration and improvement of export infrastructure and trade regulations are two of the key prerequisites for the sustainable export of agricultural products. Building additional transshipment hubs and terminals near ports and land borders with the European Union will increase export capacity. Diversifying export markets by establishing new trade partnerships in Africa, Asia, and Latin America will reduce dependency on specific markets and improve export stability. Furthermore, improving product quality in line with international standards will increase the competitiveness of Ukrainian agricultural products in European markets.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s agriculture sector, particularly grain and oilseed production, is export oriented. Following Russia’s 2014 occupation of the Donbas and annexation of Crimea—both regions that were previously dominated by heavy industry—agriculture’s share of Ukraine’s total exports rose from below 25 percent to over 40 percent. In 2021, Ukrainian agricultural exports totaled $27.7 billion, with grain exports accounting for $12.3 billion. Although the actual dollar amount of agricultural exports has decreased since the full-scale invasion, due in large part to declining global prices for grains and oilseeds since 2020, the decline has been less severe than in other sectors. As a result, agriculture’s share of Ukraine’s total exports increased to nearly 60 percent in 2024 (see Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of Ukraine’s agricultural exports is geographically diverse. Prior to the war, Ukraine supplied food to over 170 countries, feeding roughly 400 million people annually. Continued attacks on civilian port infrastructure threaten to disrupt the supply of food to countries in acute need and to drive up global food prices, as seen during the initial blockade of Black Sea ports in early 2022, when global food prices reached all-time nominal highs. Therefore, ensuring the development and diversification of agricultural exports, alongside the stable and efficient functioning of agricultural markets, is critical to global food security and Ukraine’s economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XenPGFb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Agricultural Exports vs. Total Exports in Ukraine, 2001–2024&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s blockade of Black Sea ports at the beginning of the war significantly threatened food security in import-dependent countries, as Ukraine was unable to continue exporting agricultural products to its traditional markets. The resulting shortage of grain supply in global markets led to an immediate price spike. At the same time, Ukraine accumulated significant ending stocks of grain and oilseeds that caused a shortage of domestic storage capacity for the 2022 harvest. With Black Sea ports accounting for more than 90 percent of Ukraine’s agricultural exports prior to the 2022 invasion, Ukraine was forced to develop alternative export routes that have significantly changed its trade patterns throughout the war. However, Ukraine faces a number of issues that prevent it from realizing its export capacity without the Black Sea ports, including wider railway track gauges than in Europe, a shortage of railway grain cars, a shortage of lorries and drivers for export by roads, and the low transshipment capacity of Danube River ports and land border crossing points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union’s early measures in support of Ukraine included the Solidarity Lanes, which are export routes connecting Ukraine with European countries and Moldova via roads, rivers, and railways. By January 2024, the Solidarity Lanes had facilitated the export of roughly 68 million metric tons of agricultural products, representing 60 percent of Ukraine’s wartime agricultural exports. The Black Sea Grain Initiative, an agreement between Ukraine and Russia that was brokered by the United Nations and Turkey, temporarily restarted the operation of the greater Odesa ports on the Black Sea. During the initiative’s 12 months of implementation (July 2022–July 2023), Ukraine supplied 32.9 million metric tons of agricultural products to 45 countries across three continents, including 725,000 metric tons (8 percent of Ukraine’s total exported wheat) for the UN World Food Programme, which was distributed to people in need in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. After Russia’s withdrawal from the initiative, Ukraine nonetheless continued exports from the greater Odesa ports. Ukrainian air defense capabilities have enabled the ports’ operations despite frequent Russian missile and drone attacks. Since its development 18 months ago, the Ukrainian maritime corridor has exported 100 million metric tons of cargos to 53 countries, including 65 million metric tons of agricultural products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logistical challenges and the export diversification brought on by the war affected the geographical structure of Ukrainian agricultural exports as Ukraine was forced to search for alternative markets. While the Solidarity Lanes were intended to facilitate Ukrainian products’ export to markets around the world, a glut of Ukrainian agricultural products accumulated in European markets. In 2021, the share of Ukraine’s agricultural exports to Europe was 32.4 percent; following the redirection of export routes, it increased to 55.2 percent in 2022 and 60.7 percent in 2023. At the same time, Ukraine’s exports to other regions fell due to complicated and expensive logistics. The share of Ukrainian exports to African countries shrank from 13.5 percent in 2021 to 7.1 percent in 2023; in this same period, exports to Asia fell from 19.4 percent to 10.9 percent, and exports to Southeast Asia fell from 12.7 percent to 4.7 percent. To stabilize European markets amid their oversaturation with Ukrainian products, the European Union agreed to significant export restrictions for certain agricultural products, which rebalanced Ukraine’s trade to global markets. Diversifying export opportunities remains a strategic objective for Ukraine as it continues to balance traditional maritime exports with the alternative trade routes developed throughout the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion of agricultural exports, especially to highly developed countries, requires improving quality and implementing product certification, which will increase the competitiveness of Ukrainian products on foreign markets. In 2024, Ukrainian producers gained access to new foreign markets for sixteen groups of goods in nine countries around the world. Ukraine is also introducing Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) to harmonize legislation with the European Union in the field of food safety and quality; however, certification of agricultural and food products is optional. At the same time, many importing countries require quality certificates and compliance with their standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing an agricultural export strategy requires an integrated approach toward the agriculture sector and international trade. Numerous direct and indirect measures aim to improve the competitiveness of Ukrainian products, ensure uninterrupted supply and stable demand, and increase Ukraine’s export earnings from agriculture, creating a multiplier effect for the sector’s development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve seaport infrastructure and navigation safety.&lt;/strong&gt; Restoration and further improvement of seaport infrastructure and guarantee of navigation safety are some of the key prerequisites for sustainable and diversified exports of agricultural products. Recently, the Ukrainian Sea Port Authority released a strategy for development that will require significant investment. It is seeking international assistance from the World Bank and the European Union to improve Ukraine’s seaport capacity for exports, which includes restoring critical port infrastructure, installing special equipment at port facilities and in the water areas, purchasing specialized port fleets and transshipment equipment, and dredging the Danube River ports’ water areas to allow deeper-sea vessels to enter. As part of this strategy, the Ukrainian Sea Port Authority also plans to purchase floating barriers through funding from the Howard Buffett Foundation, including underwater nets, to protect from penetration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Construct additional transshipment hubs.&lt;/strong&gt; The planned addition of new transshipment hubs, specifically dry ports, within Ukraine and along its border with EU countries will ensure more convenient logistics for agricultural products and increase Ukraine’s export capacity. These new hubs will have the ability to receive grain from trucks, grain wagons, semi-wagons, and containers and transfer it to European standard wagons. A planned extension of European tracks (gauge 1435 millimeter) in Ukraine’s territory and Ukrainian tracks (gauge 1520 millimeter) in the European Union will further support this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversify export markets.&lt;/strong&gt; The establishment of new trade partnerships for Ukraine across Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America will reduce agricultural export dependency on the European Union and ensure export stability. This could be mutually beneficial for importers, as they will reduce their import dependence on dominant partners and receive high-quality and relatively low-cost agricultural products, given the affordability of Ukrainian products relative to global prices. Export diversification also involves expanding the range of agricultural exports and improving their quality to meet international standards and increase competitiveness in European markets. Continued work on opening new markets for a range of Ukrainian products—such as poultry products, live cattle and sheep, beef and pork, milk and dairy products, honey, apples, blueberries and cherries, peas and beans, onions, wheat flour, and fish and fish products—would accelerate support of agricultural producers in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve competitiveness of Ukrainian agricultural products in foreign markets.&lt;/strong&gt; Policymakers should consider export subsidies, value-added tax compensations for exported goods, tax exemptions, and other fiscal measures to help export-oriented agricultural producers reduce their costs and increase marginal profit. Certification and compliance with phytosanitary standards will contribute to quality improvement and facilitate the promotion of products to the markets of higher-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;development-of-human-resources-and-education-in-the-agriculture-sector&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Development of Human Resources and Education in the Agriculture Sector&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s agriculture sector is experiencing a labor deficit due to forced population displacement, the conscription of men into Ukraine’s armed forces, and causalities that have resulted from Russia’s war. This deficit is especially acute for high-skilled and experienced agricultural workers. At the same time, the workloads of women and youth on farms have increased as they take on the responsibilities of their husbands and fathers. A reduction in the labor force required to perform the ongoing operations results in additional losses. Exemptions from army mobilization for small- and medium-sized farms can improve agricultural labor provision and help stabilize rural economies. Comprehensive policy measures, including incentives to attract workers back to rural areas from urban areas and abroad, as well as investments in mechanization and innovative technologies to partially offset the lack of manpower, should be considered. Transformation of Ukraine’s agricultural education and extension system to be more resilient, adaptive, and supportive of the nation’s recovery by providing up-to-date knowledge and trainings for young farmers, women, and veterans will contribute to the long-term development of the agriculture sector and ensure sustainable growth.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2022, Ukraine’s rural labor force consisted of 5.5 million people, or 31.4 percent of the total labor force of the country. Total employment in rural areas was 4.8 million people—or 87.3 percent of its labor force. Almost 2.7 million people were involved in agriculture, forestry, and fishing (this includes individuals employed in agricultural enterprises, family members of private farms, and commercially oriented households, or those engaged in agricultural production for profit). As a result of Russia’s hostilities, some agricultural workers and farmers were forced not only to cease economic activity in the agriculture sector, but also to leave their homes. More than 150,000 agricultural workers were directly affected by the war and/or were forced to migrate. Small- and medium-sized producers specializing in seasonal products—critical providers of employment and income in rural areas—have been particularly affected. Labor shortages induced by the war, especially for highly skilled and experienced workers, has not only negatively impacted farm operations but increased workloads for segments of the population not previously integrated in Ukraine’s agricultural labor force, namely women and youth. The war has caused irreversible losses not only among the military, but also among the civilian population: At least 126,000 civilians were killed and 294,000 injured during the first three years of the war, and 5.2 million Ukrainian refugees from both urban and rural areas remain abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous surveys conducted with agricultural producers across Ukraine reflect the severe shortage of diverse labor needs. In a survey of the Association of Pig Farmers of Ukraine, 26 percent of members reported suffering from insufficient personnel (e.g., technologists, veterinarians, operators, and managers of production sites) and auxiliary workers (e.g., fitters and electricians). Approximately 48 percent of the members reported a shortage of personnel in areas of activity related to agricultural production, such as drivers, tractor operators, mechanics, and agronomists. Similarly, in a producer survey carried out by Mercy Corps and Pro-Consulting, approximately 88 percent of fruit and vegetable producers, 71 percent of poultry producers, and 75 percent of dairy producers in partially occupied, deoccupied, or frequently shelled areas reported that labor shortages limited their production. This reduction of the agricultural labor force—which requires operations to adapt, restore, and modernize production assets—has led to compounding losses, limiting of activity, and even the discontinuation of agricultural activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2023, Ukraine introduced a procedure for exempting military conscripts for enterprises, institutions, and organizations that are critically important for ensuring a functioning economy and preserving people’s livelihoods. This exempted some agricultural workers at farms with more than 1,000 ha that employ 50 or more people from military conscription. In April 2023, this law was amended to include farms with 500 to 1,000 ha and as few as 20 employees. Although the procedure was amended again later in 2024 to allow extension of the exemption for up to 12 months, it does not apply to basic laborers and fails to address the problems faced by small- and medium-sized operations. Farms that cultivate up to 500 ha make up the largest group of agricultural producers, supplying a significant amount of food to the market, and they are mainly family farms, meaning that their income entirely depends on the farm’s operation. In a March 2025 meeting with the Ukrainian parliament, the Committee on Agrarian and Land Policy once again raised the issue of military conscription exemptions for small agricultural producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another government initiative aimed at increasing the workforce was the establishment of the Ministry of National Unity of Ukraine (MNUU) in December 2024, which resulted from the reorganization of the Ministry of Reintegration. The MNUU is intended to stimulate the return of Ukrainian refugees from abroad. Its creation sparked significant criticism, as many of its functions duplicate functions already performed by other state bodies. Recently, the MNUU and the UN Refugee Agency launched a strategic partnership to support internally and externally displaced Ukrainians. However, the share of those planning to return to their homeland is nonetheless declining, dropping from 74 percent at the end of 2022 to 43 percent at the end of 2024. This trend will continue in proportion to the duration of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agricultural education and extension are important elements of strengthening the agriculture sector broadly, especially as Ukraine works to fill the skilled labor shortage. During its years of independence, Ukraine significantly improved its education system. However, the destruction of educational facilities and the mobilization and displacement of faculty and students caused by the war negatively impacted agricultural universities’ ability to train a sufficient number of qualified employees and provide in-demand advisory services that meet today’s challenges. Some agricultural colleges, such as the Tavria State Agrotechnological University, Luhansk National Agrarian University, Kherson State Agrarian and Economic University, and Bakhmut Vocational Agrarian Lyceum, were relocated from occupied areas to territory controlled by the Ukrainian government. Many educational institutions switched to distance and hybrid (online/offline) learning, which is complicated by a lack of stable internet connection, insufficient access to electricity, and insufficient access to bomb shelters, as well as limited opportunities to conduct practical and lab classes, experiments, and trials, which are crucial for agricultural education. One initiative aimed at addressing this issue is the FABU project, implemented by the German Ministry of Food and Agriculture, which focuses on improving agricultural vocational training in Ukraine during the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labor scarcity in the economy is usually compensated for with the introduction of capital-intensive technologies. Ukrainian agricultural producers have faced significant capital losses during the war, especially in machinery and equipment, and their replacement and modernization based on the “build back better” principle will require significant capital investment. But human resources will still be essential to operating these technologies and performing other operational functions to ensure sustainable agricultural production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preserve human resources in agriculture.&lt;/strong&gt; To ensure sufficient agricultural production, farmers must be able to carry out agricultural work in accordance with the agricultural calendar regardless of the size of their farm. As proposed earlier by the Committee on Agrarian and Land Policy, it is recommended to extend military conscription exemptions for small agricultural producers: reserving the head of farms cultivating 20–100 ha, as well as the heads and 50 percent of military-eligible employees of farms cultivating grains on 100–500 ha of land and farms growing fruits and vegetables, but no more than one person per 100 ha. At a minimum, farmers who are fighting should be able to return to their farms in time to perform critical field work. This would save the workforce for the agriculture sector, stabilize agricultural production, and solve some socioeconomic issues in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentivize employment and labor productivity growth in agriculture.&lt;/strong&gt; Higher-paying jobs in urban areas or make it increasingly difficult to attract personnel to work in rural areas, especially during wartime. Addressing the labor shortage will require comprehensive policy measures, including incentives to attract workers back to rural areas and investments in mechanization and innovative technologies to partially offset the lack of manpower. Workers will also require additional training to operate modern technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve educational programs and institutions.&lt;/strong&gt; The agricultural workforce shortage is exacerbated by the weak capabilities of the agricultural education system both quantitative (e.g., lack of faculty, staff, and low enrollment) and qualitative (e.g., outdated equipment and curricula and damaged facilities). Event after obtaining certifications, personnel are not ready to perform production tasks without significant additional practical training. To ensure sustainable agricultural production during and after the war, transforming Ukraine’s agricultural education system to be more resilient and adaptive will be crucial. Systematic study of trends in the development of the agriculture sector, as well as deeper collaboration between MAPFU and Ministry of Education, will contribute to this aim. Attracting additional funding and adopting expertise brought by international investors remains a potential direction through which investors can participate in the sector’s future development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stimulate the influx of labor to agriculture from urban areas and from abroad.&lt;/strong&gt; After the war, Ukraine will be able to count on the return of part of the forcibly displaced population, in particular agricultural workers, which will create additional opportunities for the restoration of production. The main barriers to return remain security issues, as well as access to work in a relevant specialty, a decent salary, and housing. Therefore, the diversification of agricultural production and the corresponding creation of new jobs, along with the expansion of non-farm activities in rural areas, will stimulate the influx of labor from urban areas and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve the inclusiveness of agricultural education and extension.&lt;/strong&gt; Returning veterans will also be seeking employment. In one survey, 30 percent of interviewed farmers said they were open to hiring veterans and people with disabilities, but agricultural equipment typically lacks the necessary accessibility modifications, pointing to a key gap that needs to be addressed. An important task will be improving the skills of agricultural laborers and training new specialists who can work with modern technologies and ensure effective management of agricultural enterprises. Investments in education and training, as well as the development of agricultural extension services and support programs for young farmers, women, and veterans, can contribute to the long-term development of the agriculture sector and ensure its sustainable growth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;medium-term-measures-35-years&quot;&gt;Medium-Term Measures (3–5 Years)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medium-term measures should prioritize developing a sustainable and competitive agriculture sector. The two priority areas outlined below are (1) strengthening rural communities and supporting small farmers and (2) developing the livestock industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthening-rural-communities-and-supporting-small-farmers&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Strengthening Rural Communities and Supporting Small Farmers&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Rural communities and small farmers will be essential for Ukraine’s postwar recovery and economic resilience. Although decentralization has empowered local governments, war-related destruction, financial difficulties, and logistical challenges continue to hinder rural life and agricultural production. Small farmers (typically those operating on less than 500 ha), who previously accounted for over 40 percent of Ukraine’s agricultural output, require targeted financial aid, infrastructure rehabilitation, and improved market access. Government programs and international initiatives are already facilitating some recovery through infrastructure investment, grant support, and credit expansion. Additional investments in rural infrastructure, digitalization, and cooperative farming models—both domestically and globally—will be essential for ensuring sustainable development, higher productivity, and long-term food security.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decentralization reform initiated in Ukraine in 2014 significantly strengthened the capacity of Ukrainian communities by transferring administrative and financial powers to local governments, enabling them to manage local resources effectively and with greater independence. This reform aimed to improve public service delivery, increase transparency, and bring decisionmaking closer to citizens by empowering newly formed amalgamated territorial communities, known as hromada. Local governments received greater control over land use, education, healthcare, and budgetary planning, allowing them to respond more directly to the needs of their populations. A key aspect of this reform was the transfer of agricultural land management rights from the state to local communities, granting them greater control over one of their most valuable resources. Supported by international partners and enshrined in national legislation, this reform has become a cornerstone of Ukraine’s democratic governance and postwar recovery planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the war has placed additional pressure on local governance, forcing communities to address security issues, accommodate internally displaced persons, and restore damaged infrastructure. Rural areas have suffered significant losses due to the conflict, with the burden of maintaining agricultural production falling primarily on small farmers and household farms, which play a key role in ensuring local food security. Ukraine’s agriculture sector as a whole has suffered significantly in the face of war-induced challenges. Small farmers and family farms, accounting for over 40 percent of Ukraine’s pre-war agricultural production, have suffered the most due to financial resource shortages, reduced cultivated areas, and the destruction of logistical routes. Other challenges include decreased sowing areas and changes in production technologies, with indirect losses projected to reach $83 billion by the end of 2025. The continued threat of landmines and unexploded ordnance on farmland also poses a major obstacle to recovery, with contaminated territories estimated to reduce Ukraine’s GDP by $11 billion annually, hindering the revival of rural regions and delaying the return of farmers to full-scale agricultural activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damaged social infrastructure (e.g., housing, roads, bridges, schools, hospitals, stores, and utility lines) and production infrastructure (e.g., land, facilities, and equipment) makes life in rural areas extremely difficult. The recovery of rural communities and small farmers requires a comprehensive approach, including financial aid, state subsidies, international assistance, and the development of social and agricultural infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decentralization continues to provide local governments in Ukraine with greater financial resources and administrative autonomy, allowing them to invest in community development, social services, and postwar recovery initiatives. To support war-affected communities, the Ukrainian government has implemented several financial assistance programs, including the Fund for Eliminating the Consequences of Armed Aggression, which allocates funds for restoring critical infrastructure and residential buildings. The government is expanding support mechanisms for local communities, particularly through grant financing for small agricultural businesses and the development of socially oriented enterprises. A major contributor to local communities until 2025 was the USAID Governance and Local Accountability project, which played a key role in strengthening local government capacity by providing technical assistance to communities for improving administrative services, economic planning, and investment attraction. The FAO, in cooperation with the European Union, has launched a new grant support program for agricultural producers, offering grants of up to $25,000 to support berry farming and vegetable production. This program covers up to 50 percent of investment costs and facilitates the integration of small farmers into supply chains, as well as improving logistics, storage, and processing facilities. The European Union and the World Bank have also provided crucial support, allocating over $500 million for the reconstruction of destroyed infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, and roads. In addition to financing infrastructure projects, international partners are also assisting in the development of effective credit and insurance mechanisms for small farms, ensuring their resilience in challenging economic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure the sustainable development of rural areas and support small farmers, a comprehensive set of strategic measures must be implemented at the local, national, and international levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure access to finance and modern technologies.&lt;/strong&gt; A key government priority should be expanding access to financial resources, allowing farmers to develop their farms more effectively and implement modern technologies. This includes tailored credit programs, loan guarantees, and subsidies that reduce financial barriers and incentivize investments in precision agriculture, energy-efficient equipment, and climate-smart practices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop rural infrastructure and connectivity.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to financial support, another crucial policy direction is the development of rural infrastructure, including modernizing transportation networks, water supply systems, energy infrastructure, and digital communications. Infrastructure improvement will enhance agricultural productivity and raise living standards in rural areas. Special attention should be given to ensuring access to high-speed internet and digital services, which will integrate farmers into modern markets and improve digital literacy among rural populations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen cooperatives and rural entrepreneurship.&lt;/strong&gt; MAPFU should expand support programs for the development of agricultural cooperatives and agro-based clusters, enabling small farmers to share equipment, reduce input costs, and improve access to markets. The development of small farm businesses will contribute to increasing employment and, therefore, the well-being of the rural population, an important factor in preventing rural depopulation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop skills and sustainable technologies.&lt;/strong&gt; Initiatives for professional education and skills development should be expanded, including training programs in financial management, digital technologies, and sustainable farming, which will ensure better adaptation of advanced technologies and increased productivity. The use of innovative agricultural technologies and soil fertility conservation methods will further enhance farm efficiency while minimizing negative environmental impacts on rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;development-of-the-livestock-industry&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Development of the Livestock Industry&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Even though Ukraine’s livestock industry experienced difficulties before the war, positive trends in its productivity make it a promising direction for agriculture sector recovery. Government measures such as cofinancing farmers’ purchases of animals for breeding, construction and/ or reconstruction of livestock farms, subsides for increasing the number of animals, and reimbursement of incurred expenses due to animal injury and death can contribute to the sector’s recovery. However, livestock development requires larger investments than the Ukrainian government is able to provide and demands international support.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Limited access to veterinary services and medicine increases the risk of disease spread and subsequent loss of livestock population. Therefore, efforts to increase the supply of veterinary drugs, including through domestic production, and expand veterinary services and trainings will be necessary to stabilize the epizootic situation in the country. The creation of progressive forms of entrepreneurship in the livestock industry, particularly for individual farmers, will facilitate these enterprises’ integration into the agricultural market. Stabilizing and further increasing the animal population, improving animal keeping conditions, introducing advanced technologies, using better breeds, developing fodder production and processing as related industries, and stimulating livestock product export are critical prerequisites for the development of Ukraine’s livestock industry.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Ukraine is primarily known for its significant production and export of grains and oilseeds, livestock products also account for a large share of Ukrainian agricultural exports. In 2023, Ukraine ranked as the sixth-largest exporter of live bovine animals, seventh-largest exporter of poultry meats, and eight-largest exporter of dairy products. However, Ukraine’s livestock sector is still relatively small compared to those of major global producers like the European Union, Brazil, the United States, and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before the war, Ukraine’s livestock sector experienced difficulties. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the destruction of agricultural infrastructure and inter-sectoral connections led to a loss of profitability in the livestock industry and forced farmers to slaughter a significant number of animals. Between 1990 and 2022, Ukraine’s cattle population decreased by 10 times (including dairy cows by 5.7 times), pigs by 3.6 times, and sheep and goats by 8.1 times (See Figure 3). Only the poultry industry, which benefits from a shorter production cycle and lower costs, demonstrated some recovery after declining by half from 1990 to 1998 and then increasing by 79 percent by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion has accelerated losses in Ukraine’s livestock industry. According to the Kyiv School of Economics, farms have lost 238,000 head of cattle, 544,000 head of pigs, 131,000 head of sheep and goats, and almost 13 million head of poultry as a result of the war, a loss worth $254 million. Reduction in the animal population has accelerated a decrease in livestock production. For example, Ukraine’s total meat production decreased by 44 percent between 1990 and 2021; by 2024, this figure had dropped an additional 3.5 percent. At the same time, thanks to more advanced production technologies, better breeds, and improved farm management practices, the productivity of animals per head has increased: For example, milk yields per cow increased from an average of 2,900 metric tons in 1990 to 5,700 metric tons in 2024 (See Figure 3). Moreover, the significant reduction in beef and pork production was partially offset by poultry meat, production of which increased from 708,400 metric tons in 1990 to 1.4 million metric tons in 2024. Considering the positive trends in livestock productivity, the sector’s development is a promising direction for Ukraine’s agriculture sector recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OrpsbT8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Livestock Population and Annual Production in Ukraine, 1990–2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before Russia’s full-scale invasion, the government of Ukraine had prioritized the development and profitability of animal husbandry in order to strengthen self-sufficiency in meat and dairy products. To support livestock producers and increase the number of animals, the government initiated a program providing partial reimbursement (80 percent) of the cost of breeding animals purchased for further reproduction, partial reimbursement (50 percent for agricultural enterprises and 70 percent for cooperatives) of the cost of construction and/or reconstruction of livestock farms and complexes, and a special budget subsidy for farmers to reproduce livestock on-site to disincentivize importing live cattle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the full-scale invasion, and the resulting significant loss of livestock population as a main asset for agricultural production and source of income for many farmers, the Ministry of Agrarian Policy developed a methodology for reimbursing incurred expenses, including replacement of injured, dead, or lost animals, Later, additional subsidies of $170 per head were provided to livestock farmers with 3–100 cattle, along with $50-per-head subsidies for farmers with 5–500 goats or sheep of breeding stock. Though the subsidies were modest, they contributed to efforts aimed at reducing livestock production costs and encouraging the sector’s development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the invasion, farmers, especially in rural areas near the front line, have struggled to access veterinary services and medicine, which significantly increases the risk of disease spread and subsequent loss of livestock population. According to a survey conducted by Mercy Corps, 23.9 percent of respondents reported a deterioration in the availability of veterinary drugs; many emphasized their high cost. To address this issue, the Swiss Federal Office for Food Safety and Veterinary Affairs and the consulting company SAFOSO AG, along with partner organizations, organized humanitarian aid in the form of veterinary drugs and feed additives to support Ukrainian livestock farming and protect animal health. Additionally, in order to ensure food security in Ukraine and improve access to high-quality and safe dairy products, Switzerland has been providing humanitarian assistance to milk producers in the most affected regions with a project launched in cooperation with MAPFU, the Association of Milk Producers, and other partners. Milk producers can obtain products for washing and disinfecting milking equipment, pre- and post-milking udder treatment, wipes for udder hygiene, gloves, reagents for detecting hidden forms of mastitis, and disinfectants for livestock premises. And as part of the activities of the international charitable fund SaveUA, teams from the Association of Milk Producers, the Ukrainian Agrarian Council, and the Association of Pig Farmers of Ukraine have been collecting and delivering humanitarian veterinary aid to livestock farms and offering remote consultations on animal reproduction, health, diet, and feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Ukraine’s Ministry of Economy launched a program for farmers to relocate their businesses from dangerous zones. Although there have been some successful examples of livestock farms relocating from the front line to other regions, such possibilities are limited due to regular Russian missile strikes on frontline settlements. In addition, farmers would be able to transfer only part of their livestock, since most farms in Ukraine were built during the Soviet era and do not meet modern requirements for keeping animals, and there is a shortage of open agricultural plots. Indeed, the country’s lack of suitable premises for keeping cows creates the conditions for a further reduction in the livestock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure national food security and satisfy domestic demand for meat and dairy products, MAPFU recently introduced a concept known as the State Targeted Economic Program for the Development of Livestock Breeding. The concept, still in development, provides a framework for inclusive government policy aimed at restoring livestock production after the war and until 2033. Currently, large agricultural enterprises experience higher cattle and cow productivity than households and small farms, while this trend is reversed for pork productivity. Livestock production has also become more concentrated in large enterprises compared to small- and medium-sized farms. To address these disparities, the program should provide for organizational and economic measures to create progressive forms of entrepreneurship in the livestock industry, particularly for individual farmers, which will facilitate their integration into the agricultural market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modernize the livestock industry.&lt;/strong&gt; Along with the stabilization and increase of the animal population (especially cattle/cows and pigs), improvement of animal keeping conditions and the introduction of advanced technologies are key to the industry’s development. Concurrently, farmers need to take actions to improve animal diet, use feed additives, enhance manure management, and safeguard animal health in order to reduce the negative impact of greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve livestock breeding and genetics.&lt;/strong&gt; Implementing measures to preserve local breeds of farm animals, provide the livestock industry with genetic resources of Ukrainian origin, and improve the genetics of highly productive transborder breeds through selection will contribute to the formation of more adaptive and resilient livestock for domestic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure sanitary conditions and stable veterinary care.&lt;/strong&gt; Protecting livestock facilities from biological, infectious, and invasive threats as well as preventing negative environmental consequences from livestock production will not only stabilize Ukraine’s animal population but also increase food safety and facilitate compliance with EU standards. Increasing domestic production of veterinary medicine and expanding veterinary service will be critical to stabilizing the epizootic situation in the country, particularly the ongoing African swine fever outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen the crop production–livestock–food processing value chain.&lt;/strong&gt; Livestock creates demand for crop products as feed and supply of raw materials for the food processing industry. Development of fodder production will provide animals with adequate nutrition in sufficient quantity in response to the reduction of pastures due to contamination by mines and shells, which will in turn contribute to the increase of animal productivity. Development of the processing industry will stimulate increase of livestock production through stable demand and prices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase self-sufficiency in animal products.&lt;/strong&gt; Even before the war, Ukraine’s self-sufficiency (i.e., domestic production to consumption ratio) in meat, excluding poultry, was no more than 88 percent. Compared to the rational consumption norm (i.e., domestic production to dietary recommendation for consumption ratio), self-sufficiency was even lower: 77 percent for pork, 40 percent for beef, and 55 percent for milk. Expansion of livestock production will not only decrease import dependency for livestock products but also open new opportunities for export, especially after the Ukrainian government abolished the licensing of certain agricultural products for export (e.g., live cattle, frozen cattle meat, poultry meat, meat and edible meat offal, edible meat meal or meat offal, cattle meat, and poultry eggs). Stimulating livestock product exports through the use of fiscal, tariff, and nontariff methods will encourage an increase in Ukraine’s domestic livestock production by harmonizing the interests of raw material producers, processors, intermediaries, and importers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;long-term-measures-5-years&quot;&gt;Long-Term Measures (5+ Years)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term measures should focus on supporting Ukraine’s integration into the global agricultural economy and attracting international partners. The three priority areas outlined below are (1) integration of the agriculture sector with Europe, (2) adaptation of agricultural production to climate change and environmental sustainability, and (3) development of the food processing industry and high value-added production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;integration-of-the-agriculture-sector-with-the-european-union&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Integration of the Agriculture Sector with the European Union&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Integrating Ukraine’s agriculture sector into the European market is a strategic priority that requires harmonizing legislation, modernizing infrastructure, and expanding export opportunities. Due to the challenges of war, Ukraine was forced to redirect a significant share of its agricultural exports to the European Union, which accelerated the sector’s partial adaptation to European standards. In response to new market conditions, producers focused on goods that meet the European Union’s phytosanitary and quality requirements. Trade expansion was further supported by temporary liberalization measures under the Solidarity Lanes initiative and the European Union’s autonomous trade preferences. Government initiatives, in partnership with EU-backed programs, have focused on improving sanitary and phytosanitary control, strengthening certification procedures, and enhancing logistical infrastructure. Further efforts should simplify customs procedures, improve quality control, and enhance cooperation with European certification bodies. Expanding financial and technical support from international partners will accelerate agricultural modernization, boost export potential, and enhance Europe’s food security.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is actively working on integrating its agriculture sector with the European Union, focusing on harmonizing legislation, implementing EU standards, and expanding access for Ukrainian agricultural products to the European market. The country holds official EU candidate status, granted in June 2022, and formal accession negotiations commenced with an intergovernmental conference in June 2024. Ukraine has since initiated bilateral screening meetings, assessing its alignment with EU legislation across various sectors. The country aims to open multiple negotiation clusters throughout 2025, demonstrating its commitment to advancing toward EU membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the European Commission, in 2024, the share of Ukrainian agricultural exports to EU countries increased, demonstrating producers’ gradual adaptation to European requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite significant challenges caused by the war, the need for rapid adaptation has accelerated the implementation of European agricultural practices. In its annual enlargement report published on October 30, 2024, the European Commission assessed Ukraine’s readiness in the sphere of agriculture and rural development as being in the early stages of preparation. At the same time, in the sphere of food safety, veterinary, and phytosanitary policies, Ukraine was recognized as moderately prepared, highlighting the need to accelerate legislative adaptation, modernize quality control infrastructure, and improve certification mechanisms in line with EU requirements. Ukraine is actively working on harmonizing its regulatory framework in the agriculture sector with EU legislation, particularly in the areas of subsidies, land relations, and environmental production standards. At the same time, there is a pressing need to strengthen the institutional capacity of state bodies responsible for implementing agricultural and food safety policies. Despite positive export dynamics, a significant share of Ukrainian producers still face challenges related to certification, access to EU markets, and compliance with traceability requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, agricultural products accounted for 59 percent of Ukraine’s total exports, reaching $24.5 billion, marking the second-highest level after the record in 2021. Agricultural exports to the European Union amounted to $12.8 billion, or 51.7 percent of Ukraine’s total EU exports. This reflects Ukraine’s gradual integration into the European market and the adaptation of agricultural producers to EU standards. A significant step forward was the adoption of several laws prepared by the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Agrarian and Land Policy, which aim to improve the regulatory framework and align it with EU requirements. In addition, Ukraine and the European Union are jointly implementing projects to reform sanitary and phytosanitary control, establish effective quality control mechanisms, and introduce European certification procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several recent European initiatives have aimed at increasing coordination with Ukrainian farmers. The EU4Business program supports Ukrainian farmers and small- and medium-sized agricultural enterprises through consultative assistance, grant programs, and loans. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) supports projects that improve logistical infrastructure for agricultural exports and expands certification opportunities for Ukrainian producers to meet EU standards. This support is particularly crucial in the context of postwar recovery, as it contributes not only to stabilizing agricultural production but also to building a more resilient and competitive logistics system. Investments by the EBRD in infrastructure modernization help reduce dependence on traditional export routes, which have become vulnerable due to the war, and promote the development of alternative supply corridors, especially through Ukraine’s western borders. At the same time, certification support opens new market opportunities within the European Union, encourages the adoption of European quality standards, and enhances the position of Ukrainian products in global supply chains. Combined with grants and concessional loans provided through the EU4Business program, these efforts create favorable conditions for the effective integration of Ukraine’s agriculture sector into the European economic area and for strengthening its export potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has introduced additional trade liberalization measures, extending duty-free and quota-free access for Ukrainian agricultural products to the EU market through 2025, fostering integration and increasing Ukraine’s export potential. Strengthening cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union remains a priority, ensuring the modernization of agricultural production, improvement of quality standards, and expanded opportunities for Ukrainian farmers in the European market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine must accelerate the adaptation of national legislation to EU standards, particularly in food safety, veterinary care, and phytosanitary control, which requires comprehensive infrastructure modernization and the implementation of effective certification mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen quality control and regulatory alignment.&lt;/strong&gt; To support further integration with Europe, Ukraine will need to focus on improving the state quality control system for agricultural products, enhancing coordination between government agencies and the private sector, ensuring compliance with EU norms, and expanding market access for Ukrainian producers. In 2025, Ukraine is set to undergo an active phase of legislative screening to assess the alignment of its legal framework in the agricultural sector—including land use, farming, and food safety—with EU regulations. A crucial area of focus for policymakers should be the development of laboratory infrastructure to enable high-quality product inspections according to international standards. This will require support from international financial institutions and expert assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facilitate export logistics and border infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt; To facilitate the uninterrupted export of Ukrainian agricultural products, Ukrainian and European leaders should simplify customs procedures, expand logistical routes, and establish new export hubs in border regions with the European Union. Poland has announced plans to establish a dry port on the border for agricultural products, which will increase Ukrainian export volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advance certification and market access:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukrainian authorities should advance cooperation with European certification bodies to streamline the inspection and approval processes for Ukrainian agricultural products, ensuring alignment with EU standards and facilitating smoother access to European markets. This will help producers meet EU standards more efficiently, enabling quicker access to high-value markets and strengthening Ukraine’s position in the European supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobilize international support and joint investment.&lt;/strong&gt; International partners can enhance their support by financing technical assistance programs, providing grants for adapting production to European environmental standards, and promoting joint investment platforms for Ukrainian agribusinesses. Deepening economic integration with the European Union and implementing joint strategic agricultural initiatives will not only drive the development of Ukraine’s agriculture sector but also strengthen Europe’s food security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;adaption-of-agricultural-production-to-climate-change-and-environmental-sustainability&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Adaption of Agricultural Production to Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The adaptation of Ukraine’s agriculture sector to climate change is crucial for sustainable growth, food security, and economic stability in the long term. Rising temperatures, soil degradation, and extreme weather events pose serious risks, necessitating modern climate adaptation strategies. Ukrainian farmers are increasingly adopting precision farming, biogas energy solutions, and advanced irrigation systems to improve efficiency and mitigate risks. Ukraine’s Environmental Security and Climate Adaptation Strategy Until 2030 provides a national framework for integrating eco-friendly technologies and sustainable farming practices. Expanding international cooperation, financial assistance, and farmer education programs will accelerate the adoption of climate-resilient agricultural methods, reduce environmental risks, and enhance Ukraine’s agricultural competitiveness in global markets.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian farmers are increasingly facing the negative consequences of climate change, including droughts, declining soil fertility, erosion, rising average annual temperatures, and the spread of new pest species. Over the past 30 years, the average annual temperature in Ukraine has increased by 1.2°C. These changes pose a serious threat to the sustainable development of agriculture; as the frequency of extreme weather events increases, natural ecosystems, human health, and economic stability are negatively impacted. This problem is not unique to Ukraine—one assessment estimates that without adaptation measures, global agricultural production could decrease by 30 percent by 2050—but Ukraine is particularly vulnerable due to its reliance on crop production, export-oriented agriculture, and the significant environmental damage caused by the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adaptation can also provide new opportunities. In the face of growing challenges, Ukrainian farmers are exploring new crops and practices to ensure resilience and productivity. For example, climate change has significantly contributed to the expansion of grain cultivation, particularly corn, which has become one of the most promising agricultural crops in Ukraine. Rising temperatures, an extended growing season, and the northward shift of sufficient moisture zones have created favorable conditions for increasing corn acreage. Additionally, increasing precipitation variability and frequent droughts have encouraged farmers to adopt drought-resistant hybrids and innovative cultivation methods, leading to a substantial rise in corn yields. These changes have not only boosted grain production but have also transformed the structure of Ukraine’s agriculture sector, making it more adaptable to emerging climate challenges. Developing climate adaptation strategies, enhancing resilience, and reducing risks are crucial elements of Ukraine’s commitments under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian farmers are actively implementing modern methods to enhance the resilience of agriculture to climate change. The use of precision farming technologies such as soil analysis, field mapping, and crop monitoring has been shown to increase yields by up to 15 percent and reduce agrochemical use by 20–25 percent. Additionally, the introduction of biogas plants for processing organic waste helps reduce energy costs by an average of 30 percent, ensuring farms’ energy independence. The Ukrainian government has approved the Environmental Security and Climate Adaptation Strategy Until 2030, which focuses on modernization of irrigation systems and incentives for implementing eco-friendly technologies. International partners, including the World Bank, are actively supporting these efforts by financing projects aimed at increasing the resilience of agriculture to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The initiatives mentioned above are not only a response to climate challenges but also an important prerequisite for the long-term enhancement of the efficiency of Ukraine’s agriculture sector. The implementation of precision farming technologies, energy-saving solutions, and environmentally friendly production practices enables agricultural enterprises not only to optimize resource use and reduce costs but also to adapt to environmental changes, decreasing the vulnerability of agriculture to droughts, floods, and temperature anomalies. These approaches contribute to the formation of a new model of agricultural production—one that is more flexible, adaptive, and focused on sustainable development. Combined with government support and international financing, these measures lay the groundwork for increasing the global competitiveness of Ukrainian farmers and strengthening national food security amid wartime conditions, postwar recovery, and global climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective adaptation of the agriculture sector to climate change will require a comprehensive national strategy including climate risk assessment, modern agricultural technologies such as precision farming and drought-resistant crop varieties, and farmer training on climate adaptation measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reconstruct irrigation systems and improve water use efficiency.&lt;/strong&gt; Sustainable irrigation and efficient water use are key priorities for farmers, especially in the context of climate resilience and postwar recovery. A major focus is the modernization of infrastructure through the reconstruction of irrigation systems—particularly the introduction of water-saving technologies like drip irrigation—which can significantly reduce water consumption in arid areas and lower crop losses by 20–30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide policy and financial support for climate adaptation.&lt;/strong&gt; To promote the adoption of climate-resilient practices, government support in the form of subsidies and preferential loans will be necessary. International assistance can also play a vital role in strengthening agricultural resilience to climate change. Cooperation with international partners will facilitate the attraction of investments, expert support, and advanced technologies, enabling the implementation of climate adaptation projects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve farmer education and advisory services.&lt;/strong&gt; Educational initiatives and advisory programs will help farmers integrate innovative farming methods that address modern environmental challenges. The implementation of these measures will contribute to enhancing the climate resilience of Ukraine’s agriculture sector and ensure its sustainable development in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The food processing industry plays an important role in the economy of Ukraine. It is responsible for processing agricultural products to produce finished food products and semifinished products with higher added value for consumption in domestic and foreign markets. Despite suffering damage during the war, the industry has demonstrated relative resilience—in 2024, the productivity of the food processing industry increased by 15.9 percent. The development of the food processing industry will require a transformation from Ukraine’s current agricultural model to a new, large-scale, intensive model, which will ensure sufficient supply of quality raw materials through the introduction of modern practices and technologies, including advanced biotechnologies. However, such intensification must comply with environmental protection requirements and European standards. Diversification and growth of food production and exports will increase budget revenue, GDP, and food self-sufficiency, as well as reposition Ukraine in the global food system.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food processing industry constitutes over 8 percent of Ukrainian GDP and comprises more than 40 subsectors; the dominant sectors (in terms of volume) are vegetable oil and animal fats, sugar, beverages, and animal feed production. In 2021, the food processing industry accounted for 30.9 percent of Ukraine’s overall processing industry revenue. Vegetable oil and animal fats made up the largest share of revenue (8.9 percent), followed by meat products (4.6 percent), beverages (3.1 percent), dairy products (2.9 percent), and bakery products (2.1 percent). From 2015 to 2021, an average of 283,600 people were employed by the food processing industry. Food products ready for consumption are Ukraine’s third-largest export after metals and grains, and most of them are sold to EU countries, providing Ukraine with $11 billion in export revenue. Despite the war, Ukraine has maintained its position as the leading producer and exporter of sunflower oil and meal. In 2021, exports of these products reached 5.1 and 4.1 million metric tons, respectively. Following a brief decline in 2022, the industry recovered and in 2024 exported almost 6 million metric tons of sunflower oil and 4.5 million metric tons of sunflower meal and cake. Ukraine is also the world’s leading producer of tomato paste and one of the five largest European suppliers of apple concentrate. However, Ukraine still exports more raw agricultural commodities than processed products ($12.9 billion vs. $9.1 billion in export revenue, respectively, in 2023), which leads to the transfer of added value to importing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war has caused a significant crisis in Ukraine’s food processing industry. Logistics disruptions, blocking of transport routes, and damage to bridges, roads, and railways make it difficult to transport raw materials and finished products both internally and externally. Destruction of production facilities, interruptions in electricity supply due to constant missile attacks, and shortages of labor and raw materials further complicate the stable functioning of processing enterprises, and in some cases cause cessation. Economic instability and inflation have led to increased costs for food and food inputs, as well as a decrease in the solvency of both agro-industrial enterprises and citizens. Decline in domestic consumption due to lower purchasing power along with population decline, the loss of some sales markets, and a decrease in export earnings have had a negative impact on the financial stability of food processing enterprises. Food companies typically purchase used, often outdated, equipment from Europe, but due to inflation and logistical challenges, even this practice is becoming increasingly expensive. Increased costs for inputs, security, and infrastructure restoration are diverting resources from investment in food production development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure stability in the processing industry during the war, the Ukrainian government has launched several initiatives in collaboration with international organizations, in particular the EBRD. These include relocating production facilities to safer regions, supporting the creation and development of processing enterprises, and implementing further steps toward European integration. Relocating food industry enterprises requires not only finding or building suitable premises and moving equipment, but also attracting employees with appropriate knowledge and skills, developing new logistics for inputs and outputs, and opening new sales markets. The New Level grant program for processing enterprises, which falls within the framework of the government’s e-Work program, gives entrepreneurs the opportunity to receive financial support for business creation and/or development. The main conditions of the program are that business owners must create up to 25 new jobs and cofinance 50 percent the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With another grant program, the Ukrainian government is supporting the creation and development of processing facilities, including in the food industry, by cofinancing the acquisition of technological equipment for businesses that create at least five new jobs. Since 2022, the state has approved 1,156 applications for the program, representing approximately $145 million in production facilities. USAID also introduced two projects to support Ukraine’s processing facilities: USAID AGRO announced subgrant funding for the implementation of agricultural processing projects in rural areas. It was expected to provide an opportunity to attract investments in infrastructure development (e.g., cold storage and storage equipment) and create additional jobs. Out of the projects proposed for cofinancing, particular attention was paid to initiatives that aimed to restore and strengthen processing capacities for the production of value-added products from vegetables and root crops, fruits, berries, legumes, corn for food products, herbs, meat (except chicken), milk, and honey. USAID’s Competitive Economy of Ukraine Program also announced grants that would support the development of medium and large processing enterprises in Ukraine, including in the food industry. However, the continuation of the USAID programs is currently questionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian government also recently implemented a new “Made in Ukraine” initiative, which is designed to stimulate an increase in domestic consumption of internally produced products, including food, and consequently support domestic producers by helping them accumulate funds for further investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although food producers have also suffered significant losses from the war, the food processing industry has demonstrated relative resilience compared to the rest of Ukraine’s processing industry, as it is aimed at providing for the basic needs of the population and meeting the daily demand for food both within and outside the country. As of September 2022, a total of 62 percent of food industry enterprises were operating at almost full (75–99 percent) or full and above capacity compared to the prewar period, the best result among Ukraine’s processing industries. Increase of agricultural production, stabilization of domestic demand, and recovery of export logistics contributed to a 15.9 percent increase in the productivity of the food processing industry in 2024. The highest growth rates were seen in the production of sugar (39.4 percent), vegetable oils and animal fats (34.7 percent), and fruit and vegetable preservation (30.1 percent). Also, in marketing year 2023–24, a record 1.1 million metric tons of rapeseeds were processed, and export of rapeseed oil reached record 424,000 metric tons; production of soybean oil and meal increased by 22 and 29 percent, respectively. These positive trends should encourage an increase in the production of agricultural raw materials and further investments in the development of the processing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of the processing industry will require the transformation of Ukraine’s agricultural model to a new large-scale intensive model that will ensure a sufficient, quality supply of raw materials. Diversifying types of food processing and increasing the share of finished and semi-finished food products in the structure of domestic consumption and exports will contribute to increasing GDP and export revenues, improving Ukraine’s trade balance, reducing food imports and, consequently, reducing import dependency and import logistics risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attract new investment.&lt;/strong&gt; Intensive development of the processing industry will require significant investment (both domestic and foreign), but these costs are justified by the profitability of processing enterprises (which averaged 3.3 percent profits in 2021 and 8.6 percent profits in 2023). Improving economic efficiency of food processing enterprises and implementing modern technologies, including advanced biotechnologies, will contribute to the food processing industry’s growth and, consequently, Ukraine’s economic recovery. It will also increase return on investments as Ukraine shifts from exporting raw agricultural products to processed, high-value, consumer-ready products.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support new product growth.&lt;/strong&gt; Businesses trying to produce and export food products that Ukraine has not previously supplied, but for which there is domestic and/or international demand, will need financial, legislative, and consultative support. (This applies to companies focusing on both nontraditional types of commodities for Ukraine and ready-to-consume niche and organic products.) The export of agricultural and food products from Ukraine is carried out mainly by large enterprises. The Ukrainian government should provide support for the entry of small- and medium-sized agricultural producers into export markets, their involvement in international projects, and the creation of joint ventures. Contract farming will ensure uninterrupted supply of quality raw commodities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversify and expand food exports.&lt;/strong&gt; Increasing the share of agricultural products processed in Ukraine and exported as finished food products will reduce the potential for conflict with partner countries that primarily regulate the import of agricultural raw materials. Ukraine’s transition from an exporter of raw materials to a supplier of high-quality and safe products with higher added value will repositioning it in the global food system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Align the Ukrainian food sector with EU standards.&lt;/strong&gt; Increasing alignment with the European Union’s food processing and environmental standards will be a key strategic approach for Ukraine to rebuild and revitalize its food industry following the war. To address this issue, MAPFU, in partnership with UNIDO and with financial support from the German government, developed the Action Plans for the Green Recovery and Transformation of Ukrainian Food Industries, and which will address recovery for key industries, including dairy, fruits and berries, honey, grain processing, poultry and egg products, vegetable oil, and sugar, as well as cross-cutting areas such as food quality and safety and packaging. Future implementation of this plan will create jobs, enhance resilience, promote sustainable economic growth, and strengthen the productivity, competitiveness, and investment attractiveness of the food processing industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agriculture is a cornerstone of Ukraine’s economy, and the recovery of Ukraine’s agriculture sector is of strategic importance for ensuring national food security, reducing dependence on imports of critical goods, restoring export capacity, and promoting the country’s long-term sustainable economic development. Additionally, the stabilization and modernization of this sector are essential for the resilience of the global food system, as Ukraine remains one of the world’s key agricultural suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This recovery will be a complex and long-term process that requires a multidisciplinary and coordinated approach across sectors. It calls for a comprehensive reconstruction model, including infrastructure rehabilitation, technology modernization, financial support for farmers, human capital development, export activation, and effective foreign investment mobilization. The “build back better” principle should guide this process—ensuring recovery not only repairs war damage but also lays the foundation for innovation, reform, and integration into the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across all four stages—urgent, short-term, medium-term, and long-term measures—one priority remains central: the attraction of foreign investment. Despite wartime risks, Ukraine continues to demonstrate resilience and attractiveness to foreign investors—particularly in agriculture, infrastructure, and logistics—reflecting strong investor confidence in the agriculture sector’s long-term potential. Foreign capital is already playing a pivotal role in Ukraine’s recovery. Government initiatives, including war-risk insurance, preferential financing, and the development of industrial parks, have contributed to creating a more predictable and stable investment climate. In 2024, Ukraine attracted significant net foreign direct investment, with a substantial portion coming from reinvested earnings. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, 2,652 new foreign companies have registered in Ukraine, with agriculture and food remaining the most attractive sectors. Forty-three international companies have invested in Ukraine during the war, including Bayer ($65 million), Carlsberg ($40 million), and CEMARK ($30 million), which continue to expand their production capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agriculture sector requires targeted investment to implement specific priorities. Demining and infrastructure restoration remain critical, as approximately 4 million ha of farmland are still contaminated with landmines. The restoration of grain storage facilities, warehouses, and logistics infrastructure will require significant investment, with projected returns expected to substantially exceed the initial costs over the medium term. Processing modernization is equally essential, as upgrading value chains improves product quality and competitiveness in both domestic and international markets. Land market liberalization and the adoption of advanced agricultural technology have the potential to attract substantial investment and improve efficiency in agricultural production. Innovative technologies can help reduce production costs and boost annual revenues. Investment in biofuels and biomaterials opens new opportunities to strengthen energy security and support sustainability. Likewise, the development of organic agriculture is expected to significantly expand export capacity and enhance Ukraine’s positioning in high-value global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign investment, therefore, serves not only as a key enabler but also as a cross-cutting driver of agricultural recovery. Its mobilization should follow a two-stage strategy, first addressing the consequences of war, then enabling long-term investment and sustainable growth. The total potential return from these initiatives is estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars, making Ukraine’s agribusiness sector one of the most attractive destinations for international investors—even under wartime conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

This report analyzes how China’s infrastructure development is being used to gain coercive power ahead of the next conflict.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s use of critical infrastructure to control downstream water supply will threaten vital economic activities and life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will leverage rail and road networks to strengthen its positions near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India. China’s military-civilian dual-use infrastructure will continue to encroach on disputed lands while posturing the country’s forces to project coercive power and gain an advantage in the next border clash.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regional states will no longer harbor Tibetan refugee camps, while also adopting increasingly authoritarian practices made possible by surveillance systems exported by China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is actively using diplomatic, intelligence, military, and economic tools to influence, deter, and compel countries to act in the PRC’s interest. These tools are derived from a combination of the hybrid strategy and gray-zone tactics that have defined Xi Jinping’s China. The tactics cover operations ranging from corporate cyber theft to international development infrastructure projects. But while U.S. policymakers’ attention is fixed on great power competition, the PRC is also active in periphery zones and even within their own territory. In fact, the infrastructure the PRC seeks to export through Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) development projects emerged from efforts within China’s frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is fundamentally redefining infrastructure as a tool of coercion. Under the guise of economic development and increasing connectivity, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is constructing a coercive architecture across the Tibetan Plateau. This includes dams that can choke water flow to downstream states, railways that enable rapid military mobilization, and digital networks that are already exporting surveillance and repressing dissent. These projects are not neutral investments. They are latent instruments of state power—dual-use nodes that allow Beijing to pressure neighbors without triggering open conflict. As infrastructure becomes a strategic enabler of compellence and deterrence, the United States and its partners must reframe how they assess and respond to China’s actions. Failing to do so will leave the region vulnerable to incremental gains that add up to irreversible strategic shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report identifies four key sectors where PRC infrastructure development is creating coercive leverage. First—and most alarming—is water. China’s upstream control of Asia’s major rivers—accomplished through the construction of dams—allows it to manipulate downstream economies and ecosystems, giving it a potent geopolitical bargaining chip. Second, the CCP is using land development and gray-zone tactics to de facto annex disputed territory and deploy military assets under the pretext of civilian activity. Third, transportation and rail projects are enabling rapid troop movements, especially near the LAC with India, shifting the military balance in Beijing’s favor. Finally, digital infrastructure projects—particularly through firms like Huawei—are extending China’s surveillance state into neighboring countries, particularly targeting refugee populations and dissidents in Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build resilience against the PRC’s coercive infrastructure, this report recommends a three-pronged approach centered on capacity-building with regional partners, increased digital sovereignty, and expanded intelligence cooperation. First, the United States should strengthen India-Nepal cooperation through economic and infrastructure partnerships that reduce both countries’ dependency on Chinese projects. This includes leveraging institutions like the International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) to offer alternatives to BRI investments. Second, the United States must support the creation of secure digital ecosystems by promoting cybersecurity standards and countering digital authoritarianism, particularly in regions where Chinese firms like Huawei have entrenched themselves. Finally, expanding intelligence-sharing agreements modeled on the U.S.-India Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) pact can enhance early warning systems and regional deterrence against PLA activity. Together, these efforts aim to push back against Beijing’s coercive strategy by reinforcing the sovereignty, security, and resilience of states along the Tibetan Plateau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-public-good-to-a-trap-critical-infrastructure-as-a-form-of-coercion&quot;&gt;From Public Good to a Trap: Critical Infrastructure as a Form of Coercion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Power and politics are old bedfellows, and states will historically use anything and everything possible to advance their interests. This process usually plays out first through threats and indirect measures aimed at gaining bargaining advantages but short of open hostility and war. Thomas Schelling described such coercive measures as the “latent diplomacy of violence,” used to either deter an opponent from taking an action or to compel them to change their behavior. Understanding that this “power to hurt” is a type of influence provides the foundation for analyzing statecraft in terms of a bargaining process played out by rivals seeking to avoid the costly gamble of direct conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of this process is a risk-reward trade-off. States have imperfect information about their rivals’ power, interests, and issue salience (e.g., how far they will go to change or defend the status quo). As a result, leaders seek ways of “advancing without attacking” and creating conditions that change the risk-reward trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, these coercive bargains have begun to extend far beyond military signaling and diplomatic démarches to include new means of gaining leverage, often taking advantage of the complex infrastructure that connects people—cyberspace and the internet. Coercion short of a war is a key feature of cyberspace. States avoid costly signals like deploying entire military formations by taking covert cyber actions, often just deniable enough to avoid significant retribution, as a new form of signaling and communication. In other words, leaders hijack the technological infrastructure that connects information-age societies to coerce their rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This logic extends beyond cyberspace. In a world of complex interdependence, key infrastructure systems—such as financial systems, transportation networks, digital platforms, energy grids, and water resources—can be “weaponized” to gain strategic advantage. By exploiting others’ reliance on these systems, a state can exert pressure without firing a shot, effectively turning connectivity into political leverage. States in dominant network positions can deny rivals access to essential networks or supply chains—for instance, by cutting off crucial digital services or choking a trade route—thereby coercing concessions. This weaponized interdependence enables coercion through disruption: The mere threat of severing an adversary’s lifelines (financial networks, communication links, transport corridors) becomes a potent bargaining chip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, states have learned to use infrastructure-based dependencies in classic deterrence and compellence scenarios. Control over water is a notable example. Upstream countries can threaten to dam, divert, or release water in ways that harm downstream nations’ livelihoods, thereby leveraging hydrological interdependence for political gain. Such “coercive water diplomacy” gives the controlling state outsized influence. The coercive value of infrastructure lies in its dual-use nature: Projects presented as benign development or connectivity can also serve to restrain and compel. Transportation infrastructure, for instance, can not only facilitate economic integration but also enable blockades or rapid military mobilization in a crisis, tilting the local balance of power. Digital infrastructure and surveillance systems can both foster interconnectivity and provide means to monitor or black out an adversary’s communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, major powers have long incorporated infrastructure into their coercive tool kit. China’s strategic investments in roads, railways, ports, and dams across Asia exemplify this approach. By building economic linkages and physical control over critical nodes, Beijing not only boosts regional development but also gains latent coercive leverage (e.g., the ability to restrict trade flows or water supply to neighbors if they defy Chinese interests). In Tibet and other border regions, such infrastructure serves a dual role: promoting Beijing’s governance while implicitly threatening to “turn off the tap” or isolate adversaries. Thus, critical infrastructure has become a new form of power in coercion theory; much like armies or missiles, rail lines, fiber-optic cables, and dams can function as instruments of compellence and deterrence. In sum, the evolving literature on coercion highlights not only military might but also economic and infrastructural dominance as key sources of bargaining power between states. By understanding coercion in these terms—as a spectrum of influence from nuclear brinkmanship to the politicization of pipelines and waterways—analysts lay a foundation for examining cases where development and coercion go hand in hand as tools of statecraft, such as China’s infrastructure strategy on the Tibetan Plateau and its periphery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-western-development-plan&quot;&gt;The Western Development Plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC grounded its domestic infrastructure development projects in a strategy updated in the 1990s known as the Western Development Program (WDP), which focused on addressing economic, ecological, and security concerns within China’s territory. Under the auspices of economic development, China aimed to control, influence, and suppress the people in its western territories, including Xinjiang and Tibet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, the PRC’s intent was to reduce separatist sentiments and non-party approved ideologies, religion, and culture by coercion and, at times, force within the western regions. In 2025, the PRC’s surveillance state in Xinjiang, as well as its persecution and forced labor of Uyghurs in the region, is well known. Yet it is the Tibetan Plateau—a region also covered by the WDP—that presents an opportunity to study the implications of PRC infrastructure development as a tool for coercion and hybrid strategy application. This is because Tibet represents a security concern for the CCP. In the mid-twentieth century, Tibet’s autonomous governing body, spiritual and non-communist beliefs, natural resources, and border with India made its conquest—whether by diplomatic or military means—required for the CCP to establish sovereignty in what it saw as its territory. Put into action following the foundation of the CCP: The PLA invaded eastern Tibet in 1950, and by 1951, it had coerced the spiritual and political leader of Tibetans, the Dalai Lama, into negotiations. The negotiations rejected demands for autonomy and Western democratic norms (but without Tibetan military capability), and resulted in the signing of the “Seventeen Point Agreement” and China’s annexation of the region. However, the agreement was reneged on and, in alignment with Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution, all religious activities were prohibited, while limited “cultural liberation” was pursued. Infrastructure development was intended to compensate for the loss of autonomy and offset the erasure of Tibetan culture by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From its inception, the WDP sought to bind the Tibetan Plateau to Beijing through a multipronged infrastructure strategy. The Chinese political elite believed that through economic development, the Tibetans would enjoy the merits of the CCP’s leadership and, consequently, then abandon nationalist sentiments and any desire for autonomy. As such, Chinese strategy encompassed transportation networks, civil infrastructure, water resource control, and, more recently, digital surveillance systems. Key projects such as the construction of railways, including the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, and road networks have not only facilitated military mobility but have also served to consolidate economic and political control over the region. These initiatives, while framed as tools for economic development, in fact were aimed at integrating Tibetans into the Chinese state, sidelining the latter’s historic call for “one country, two systems.” Water infrastructure plays a similarly critical role in this strategy. The Tibetan Plateau, often referred to as the “water tower of Asia,” is a vital source of freshwater for neighboring countries. By controlling upstream resources in the plateau, the CCP exerts leverage over downstream nations in the Mekong region, aligning infrastructure development with geopolitical objectives. At the same time, digital infrastructure, including surveillance networks, has been weaponized to monitor and suppress dissent, enforce loyalty, and police Tibetan identity and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences of this repression extend beyond Tibet itself. China’s coercive tactics are increasingly evident in neighboring Nepal, where infrastructure projects and diplomatic pressure echo the methods employed by the CCP in the Tibetan Plateau. This spillover effect underscores how the CCP’s infrastructure strategies are not only confined to domestic objectives but also serve as a blueprint for influence and coercion abroad. As such, Tibet offers a crucial case study of infrastructure coercion and hybrid strategy, foreshadowing the global implications of China’s expansionist ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Strategic Geography of the Tibetan Plateau&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese and Tibetan interaction and conflict trace back as far as the sixth century. Although the conquest of Tibet by mainland China predates the CCP, the core grievances and the region’s importance to the CCP started with the founding of modern communist China. Three important reasons to control Tibet stood out at the beginning of the CCP’s rule. The first was that control of the Tibetan Plateau would provide access to natural resources—most importantly, water. The plateau is home to the Himalayas, known as the third pole because of the ice and glaciers at their peak. When the glaciers melt, the water flows through 10 major riverways that provide water to downstream countries including Nepal, India, Bhutan, and Myanmar. The second reason to control Tibet was the necessity for the CCP to unify what it saw as historically Chinese territory and people under communist control and ideology. In this manner, the CCP viewed the Tibetan people—and their culture—as subjects that needed (re)integration into a common identity. Lastly, the region would serve as a buffer zone against India in the case of interstate war or foreign influence. Securing Tibet provided the CCP with the ability to counter regional powers’ interests in China, including the United Kingdom, India, and the United States. The CCP saw the threat of foreign influence as a security concern because, following the Manchu Empire, the British had established a presence in Tibet’s trade markets and continued to influence the larger region indirectly through India post-independence. This was seen in action when India assumed the trading markets and continued Britain’s protector policies over Tibet, including providing ammunition to Tibetans. In addition, Tibet did not share a history of hostilities with India as it did with China, and Tibet’s religious and cultural connections to India proved a concern to the CCP. As such, for the CCP to establish a sovereign state, Tibet needed to be annexed into the new state to safeguard against foreign influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post annexation and under the auspices of development, the CCP has actively leveraged the strategic importance of Tibet to build out a buffer zone, stage military forces, and control vital economic resources. It has done this through building critical nodes of infrastructure with dual-use capabilities, serving both civilian and military purposes. The coercive threat is both implicit and explicit, and the following case studies illustrate vulnerable areas of infrastructure, ranging from water to rail infrastructure, and the potential for coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;water-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Water Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oiL9dTG.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Dam Infrastructure in Tibet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has a long history of dam construction and water control, dating back to the Qin dynasty. This tradition continues today, though modern projects on the Tibetan Plateau come with consequences for downstream countries on a scale heretofore impossible. Mao Zedong’s concern over droughts in northern China laid the ideological groundwork for this extensive development. He famously stated, “There is more water in the south and less water in the north. If possible, it is okay to borrow a little.” Since then, the PRC has embarked on an unprecedented era of hydraulic engineering, constructing over 80,000 dams and creating more than 98,000 reservoirs across the country. Water is thus being redirected to the arid climate in China’s north, improving the country’s water management while also maintaining the claim that “not one drop of China’s water should be shared without China using it first or without making those downstream pay for it.” While these projects have supported domestic growth, their environmental and geopolitical repercussions—particularly for nations reliant on rivers originating from the Tibetan Plateau—remain subjects of international concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 highlights the rivers from the Tibetan Plateau that provide access to critical water basins that feed downstream to Nepal, India, Bangladesh, and the greater Mekong region. These rivers provide irrigational, potable, and industrial water to the people of Tibet and other lower riparian states. At the same time, the water supports the PRC’s power generation and modernization plans to reduce its reliance on carbon and fossil fuels through hydropower. As such, the PRC is strategically placing dams downstream to generate energy, but at questionable locations near border river-crossing points with Bhutan, India, and Nepal. This, in turn, has neighboring countries like India concerned about the flow of water, seasonal flooding, and the land that is being claimed in disputed regions for dam construction. One example is a dam project along the Kosi River in Nepal, which flows alongside the Araniko Highway and connects to the Kodari-Zhangmu border crossing. The hydropower project benefits Nepal, but water rights issues surrounding this river flowing into India make the dam a point of contention. Another area of concern is on the Brahmaputra River, which flows from the PRC into India and Bangladesh, with fears that downstream flow could be halted for geopolitical purposes. The unilateral water management by the PRC is already creating negative downstream effects for surrounding countries while also generating a dominate strategic position for the PRC to drive relationships or coerce its neighbors into submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leverage earned emerges from the effects of dam building: Specifically, generating the power to turn off the tap and affect water access leads to the ability to harm industries and economic growth downstream. For example, since China built dams on the Mekong River in 1986, water levels, flow disruption, and increased sediment have affected Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, both individually and collectively. These changes are harming the ecosystems on the river and the economic wellbeing of communities surrounding it. A study published in 2025 found that China’s dams prevented the Mekong mainstream from topping off on the Thai-Lao border and increased water restriction during monsoon seasons between 2012 and 2014. These fluctuations are decreasing both the quality and the quantity of fish, negatively impacting a key source of regional employment. This puts at risk not only sources for employment and food, but also increases the PRC’s leverage. These negative downstream effects showcase how well positioned the PRC is to dictate policy positions and other directives to its neighbors, who otherwise risk facing water scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC will continue to strategically expand its water infrastructure in the near future to continue exerting pressure on its neighbors and the greater Mekong region. In 2021, the CCP announced in its Fourteenth Five-Year Plan that it would build a hydroelectric power station on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, which would have extensive repercussions for Southeast Asia. Apart from ecological impacts, completion of the dam would allow the CCP to change water levels and induce flood or drought in areas downstream. These commitments lay the groundwork for continuing to challenge land disputes with neighboring countries and coercing them into yielding to the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;land-villages-and-resettlement-efforts&quot;&gt;Land, Villages, and Resettlement Efforts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From its inception, the CCP’s ambitions to assert regional dominance through settler colonialism and coercive tactics were evident. In addition to its military conquest, the CCP implemented systematic efforts to suppress Tibetan culture and erase its historical identity. This included redrawing Tibet’s borders to align with Chinese administrative divisions—prefectures, counties, cities, and townships—effectively fragmenting the region and consolidating Chinese control. The PRC also established a settler-colonial system aimed at dominating Tibet and dispossessing its people of their land, culture, and self-determination. These tactics are further evident in the “whole village relocation programs” that China has enacted since the 1950s and which have accelerated in Tibet since 2016. A 2024 study by Human Rights Watch estimates that from 2000 to 2025, the PRC will have coerced the resettlement of 930,000 Tibetans. The PRC’s expansionist intentions are not limited to Tibet and the Tibetan people. In fact, following the annexation of Tibet in 1962, the PLA found itself embroiled in armed conflict over the annexation of lands shared with India, marking the Sino-Indian War. However, the CCP was not as successful as it had been in Tibet. Following a ceasefire, both countries laid claim to overlapping border territory; as of 2025, the area remains not formally demarcated, yet still serves China’s current pursuit of territorial expansion along India’s northern border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contested border area, known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), is characterized by harsh, uninhabitable terrain and sparse infrastructure, making demarcation physically difficult. The CCP exploits this ambiguity through a range of methods, including deploying PRC-aligned nomadic tribes to cross and occupy land on India’s side of the LAC. For example, since 2017, the CCP has reinvigorated the construction of border defense villages—xiaokang (“well-off”) villages—along the LAC. These villages attract settlers with government subsidies of approximately 14,000 yuan ($2,000 USD) annually. Using the pretext of supporting those settlements, the PLA constructs infrastructure and demarcates new border markers, claiming the land as PRC territory on the grounds that it is inhabited by Chinese citizens. A local official from the Indian territory of Ladakh explained that the CCP’s tactic of “salami slicing” in the LAC is designed to take land while avoiding large-scale conflict. Salami slicing refers to the prolonged and hybrid strategy conducted in small increments in which the PLA has been extending the LAC, one kilometer at a time, using proxies. Because one large push might provoke military involvement, the strategy of using small incursions over an extended period has, thus far, yielded appeasement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, it is estimated that there are around 965 xiaokang villages, with the most recent additions completed in Arunachal Pradesh, India. One of the most notable instances of salami slicing involved the construction of a dual-use bridge across Pangong Tso Lake. While it does facilitate settlements, the bridge also serves strategic military purposes by enabling the rapid movement of mechanized vehicles. By circumventing the lake, the PLA gains a potential route for striking Indian territory with minimal warning. In this context, the PRC now has a strategic hold on gray-zone territory in dispute and is able to showcase its capabilities to rapidly strike if India tries to pose a threat. In effect, the CCP built a coercive tool when it built the bridge. Given the frequency of past military engagements along the LAC, the region appears increasingly primed for renewed conflict, with CCP infrastructure projects advancing the PRC’s military posture under the guise of civilian development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transportation-and-rail&quot;&gt;Transportation and Rail&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LAwzmNa.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Dual-Use Transportation Infrastructure Supporting Military Posture in Tibet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to connect Tibet to mainland China and unlock Tibet’s natural resources—including its terrain for military and goods transport—the PRC has prioritized developing road and rail connections. Since 1959, the PRC has invested in building out Tibet’s infrastructure under the guise of economic development and integration. The scale of road and rail grew exponentially with the implementation of the WDP in the 1990s; since then, Tibet’s road network went from 4,536 miles to 73,818 miles while also connecting the region to the north and the mainland. This infrastructure has also been instrumental in the mass relocation of Tibetans and the large-scale influx of Han Chinese settlers, leading to the (intentional) erosion of Tibetan cultural identity while strengthening the PRC’s strategic positioning along its border with India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 3 highlights the positioning of rails along the path of military assets, with a central concentration in Lhasa but expanding east to Nyingchi via the Lhasa-Nyingchi Railway. Shortly after the opening of the railway, the PLA moved the 52nd or 53rd Light Combined Arms Brigades to an exercise field, for both economic development and military mobilization, underscoring the dual-use nature of Tibet’s rail network. There is already evidence of rapid deployments near the LAC with India in the Tawang Valley, which lies approximately 105 miles south of the Shannan railroad stop. Recent reporting highlights that on the route to the Bumla Pass crossing, there was an expansion of trench build-up in 2024, including Helicopter pads; images taken on January 11, 2025, show the expansion of buildings east of the helicopter landing pads. These developments will grow at a faster rate thanks in part to the growth of railroads in Tibet that facilitate the movement of construction materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping has shown no signs of slowing down investment in Tibet’s transportation infrastructure. As recently as 2020, he emphasized the importance of major infrastructure projects, stating that China must “promote the construction of key transportation and public-service facilities along the Sichuan-Tibet railway and other roads, building more unity lines and happiness roads.” While framed as a means of integrating Tibet economically and culturally with mainland China, these infrastructure developments serve a more concerning dual purpose. The proximity of new and under-construction railways to the Indian border raises significant security concerns as they offer an additional route for the rapid deployment of military assets in the event of a border dispute or conflict along the LAC near Arunachal Pradesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Tibet’s road and rail infrastructure continues to expand, Beijing is systematically positioning itself for future border skirmishes with India. The PRC’s strategic use of transportation networks extends past economic and political integration; it also serves as a crucial component of its broader military and geopolitical ambitions to deter or coercive its neighbors. By embedding dual-use infrastructure within Tibet, China strengthens its ability to mobilize military assets quickly, reinforcing its dominance in the region while posing a direct challenge to India along the LAC. The strategic use of transportation networks for military logistics underscores the PRC’s long-term ambitions in the region, demonstrating that its infrastructure projects serve not only economic and political objectives but also broader military and coercive goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;digital-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Digital Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC actively leverages digital infrastructure not only to steal intellectual property abroad but also to enhance computational propaganda and repress minority groups within its periphery. The persecution and human rights abuse of the minorities in China is well documented, with examples including relocations of millions to “reeducation” camps to suffer slave labor and sterilizations. Domestically, the CCP uses Huawei’s digital infrastructure to conduct mass surveillance on Uyghurs in Xinjiang, reinforcing its authoritarian control. Recent reports reveal that Huawei’s sales pitches included surveillance systems capable of analyzing voice recordings, monitoring detention centers, tracking political dissidents, and supporting police surveillance operations. These capabilities illustrate how, under the guise of economic development and smart-city initiatives, China repurposes digital infrastructure into sophisticated tools of coercion, effectively transforming cities into surveillance hubs. Moreover, the CCP’s digital surveillance extends beyond China’s borders. In neighboring countries like Nepal, Beijing has exerted its growing influence to monitor and suppress Tibetan refugees, using Huawei’s infrastructure and influence to curtail their movements and political activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s digital infrastructure expansion has extended its surveillance reach into Nepal, where the government digitally tracks Tibetan dissidents and refugees. In 2010, Nepal awarded Huawei a contract to upgrade the country’s telecommunications network, making Huawei Nepal’s sole provider. Over time, Huawei embedded itself within Nepal’s Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MOCIT), giving the CCP influence over media, private communications, and censorship policies. With this infrastructure in place, China has intensified its monitoring of Tibetan refugees in Nepal, using internet surveillance to track and restrict their movements, fearing that they might expose human rights abuses in Tibet. In a 2022 report, a Nepalese law enforcement official confirmed that Huawei’s technology has been misused to surveil not only Tibetans but also Nepalese officials, underscoring Beijing’s growing control over sovereign networks in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another case involved a Tibetan residing in Nepal who planned to visit their family in PRC-controlled Tibet but who had not disclosed their intent to anyone. After researching safe passage using a web address received via WeChat, the individual received an unsettling phone call—from a family member believed to be coerced—imploring them not to come due to potential risks to both their safety and their family’s wellbeing. Out of fear, the Tibetan remained in Nepal. A last example involved a Tibetan refugee in Nepal who spoke out publicly against the CCP’s mistreatment of the diaspora. This individual maintained regular contact with their family in Tibet, but suddenly, their relatives began pressuring them to return, with an urgency that felt unnatural and coerced. Suspicious of the requests, the refugee refused. In a later video call, they caught a glimpse of an armed man in the background, confirming that the PLA was attempting to lure them back into PRC-controlled Tibet for detention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s expanding digital infrastructure and surveillance tactics in Nepal exemplify its broader strategy of digital repression by weaponizing technology to silence dissent, monitor exiles, and coerce minority populations beyond its own borders. The CCP’s infrastructural influence in foreign nations extends its persecution of ethnic, religious, and political groups it deems dissidents, and reinforces its authoritarian reach beyond mainland China. In 2019, Nepal and Huawei signed a $100 million deal to supply 4G infrastructure and test Nepal’s 5G network, further entrenching the PRC’s technological dominance in the country. This deal reflects a broader trend in which nations, particularly those in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East, welcome Chinese technological investments despite the well-known risks of surveillance, censorship, and coercion. With norms and institutions still unsettled in the realm of internet governance, the PRC is actively working with partners—most notably Russia—to shape global digital standards so that they align with Chinese interests and its authoritarian model. By embedding its technology into critical infrastructure worldwide, Beijing is not just exporting hardware—it is exporting control. As Huawei and other PRC-backed firms expand, their technology will continue to be leveraged for state surveillance, political influence, and the suppression of opposition. Without significant pushback, China’s digital coercion infrastructure will further entrench authoritarian governance models, leaving vulnerable nations increasingly dependent on a system designed to serve the CCP’s strategic interests over their own sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;countering-chinas-coercive-infrastructure-in-the-tibetan-plateau&quot;&gt;Countering China’s Coercive Infrastructure in the Tibetan Plateau&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case studies addressing the CCP’s coercive infrastructure against Nepal and India demonstrate clear opportunities for the United States to counter the PRC’s expanding influence. More importantly, the case studies illustrate the tactics the CCP is likely to use against others in the Indo-Pacific. Much like Nepal, smaller nations should be wary of CCP surveillance and the use of this technology to pursue and persecute anyone considered a dissident. Meanwhile, near-peer adversaries should be cognizant of irregular warfare tactics designed to undermine border integrity and the weaponization of resources. To prevent the CCP from undermining a free and open Tibetan Plateau, the United States must increase its support of Nepalese and Indian sovereignty in the face of Chinese expansionist and coercive infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-1-foster-indian-and-nepalese-cooperation&quot;&gt;Recommendation 1: Foster Indian and Nepalese Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India and Nepal share a common interest in countering Chinese encroachment on their territories, people, and networks. To improve relations and to strategically counter the PRC’s influence, the United States needs to encourage India to take proactive steps in several key areas relating to or involving Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic and technological partnerships.&lt;/strong&gt; India and the United States can assist Nepal in modernizing its telecommunications infrastructure, offering alternatives to Chinese technology firms like Huawei. The United States can lead the charge by leveraging funding from the International Finance Corporation (DFC) and the United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) to engage partners in Nepal and India while also encouraging industry investment in Nepal’s digital infrastructure. Leveraging the DFC and USTDA aligns with expected revisions of U.S. Department of State strategy and, furthermore, will help position the United States to declare South Asia as a region critical to U.S. interests and thus to counter the CCP’s coercive power. In parallel, expanding support for the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) allows the United States to back regional integration and counterbalance Beijing’s influence. BIMSTEC provides a strategic platform to strengthen infrastructure and trade across South and Southeast Asia, particularly with India as a key partner. By investing in local firms and working with partners already embedded in the region, the United States can displace Chinese dominance over time, offering countries like Nepal sustainable, secure, and sovereign alternatives to PRC-backed development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure development.&lt;/strong&gt; Collaborating on major infrastructure projects such as roads, railways, and hydroelectric plants can provide tangible benefits to Nepal’s economy and demonstrate India’s commitment to its neighbor’s development. One method to do so is by leveraging the grant funding in the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Nepal Compact. The compact’s goal is to maintain road quality, increase access to electricity, and increase cross-border energy trade between Nepal and India. With only 8 percent of the total $500 million used as of early 2025, the United States should fast-track MCC project approvals and expand funding to include key transport corridors that integrate Nepal with India and Bangladesh, thus reducing Nepal’s reliance on China’s BRI-backed roads. In addition, financing India-Nepal hydroelectric projects with U.S. capital from the DFC can help secure Nepal’s energy independence from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan for water scarcity.&lt;/strong&gt; Preparing for the PRC to use its coercive infrastructure needs to start now. Nepal and India both will benefit from modeling outcomes in the event that China significantly reduces or halts water flowing south. This includes studying short-term solutions such as storage facilities or importing more potable water. Tabletop exercises stress-testing Nepal’s and India’s water infrastructures, supplies, and demands can provide an investment roadmap to target medium- to long-term needs. These exercises would build on previous studies funded by USAID that analyzed water programs and infrastructure in the Mekong region—first, to inform policymakers about the extent of coercive power and, second, to build alternatives to BRI investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-2-strengthen-cyber-defense-for-digital-sovereignty&quot;&gt;Recommendation 2: Strengthen Cyber Defense for Digital Sovereignty&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei’s myriad vulnerabilities create opportunities for the CCP and others to incapacitate information systems by unleashing malicious computer malware. The 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack demonstrated that the immobilization of just one oil pipeline could lead to a national state of emergency in the United States. The PLA has an entire command dedicated to conducting offensive cyber operations and can easily interfere with internet connections, power grids, banking systems, and mobile communication worldwide. Recent statements from U.S. authorities regarding an ongoing CCP campaign against U.S. infrastructure highlight these capabilities. If further action is not taken, these examples may be just the first of many potential consequences for China’s neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure development.&lt;/strong&gt; One way to counter the PRC is to encourage regional partners to mandate a standardized cybersecurity protocol for both the government and private sectors. The United States can leverage the State Department’s United States International Cyberspace and Digital Policy Strategy to strengthen “digital solidarity” and to promote collaborative efforts at the international level. Further, this strategy is designed “to counter and respond to malicious cyber operations, cybercrime, and other digital harms” and to promote “cooperative efforts among states and civic actors to defend and advance human rights.” The United States can use this updated policy to interface with India and Nepal to find solutions for protecting digital rights and privacy from PLA operations and to develop methods for countering human rights violations via digital means. Furthermore, the United States can expand cyber diplomacy efforts to propose cybersecurity cooperation agreements either on a bilateral or multilateral basis. Such cooperation agreements could design mechanisms to connect agencies like the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and foreign service officers to key partners in South Asia to help identify best practices to protect systemically critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-3-enhance-intelligence-collection-and-sharing&quot;&gt;Recommendation 3: Enhance Intelligence Collection and Sharing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early intelligence indications and warnings of escalatory actions by the PLA have successfully thwarted violence so far. In 2022, for example, geospatial intelligence that the United States shared with India allowed the Indian army to repel a PLA advance in the Arunachal Pradesh region. The skirmish did not result in any deaths, averting the potential for further escalation. This incident represents a success story in which intelligence and information sharing kept regional stability intact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence sharing.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States can reaffirm its willingness to share critical information and intelligence to support India’s own intelligence and surveillance capabilities. The previously mentioned intelligence sharing took place because of the 2020 Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) on geospatial cooperation between the United States and India. Using this as a benchmark, implementing an intelligence-sharing pact between the United States, India, and Nepal would enable higher success rates in predicting and responding to regional threats. Future efforts could expand to include establishing digital indicators that measure the onset of influence operations, including foreign-controlled bot networks. Coordination on identifying and neutralizing automated accounts, especially those used to seed confusion or amplify tensions during border standoffs, will help partners stay ahead of destabilizing narratives while minimizing public attention and concerns, political backlash, and escalatory responses. This type of practice is not uncommon; the United States is already involved in sharing intelligence through the Five Eyes and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now, the CCP has maintained a slow, methodical approach to eroding the sovereignty of nations in the Tibetan Plateau. However, the countdown to 2035 will see increasing pressure on any democracies and hybrid regimes that are not in step with the CCP’s plans. The PRC’s initial method of pressure will rely on the spread of influence operation campaigns to sow distrust and shape foreign influence. In sync with these campaigns, the CCP will employ irregular warfare tactics to foment its expansionist goals. Maintaining a free and open Tibetan Plateau will require an extensive and tailored strategic approach. The key factors to mitigate PRC expansion involve strengthening the border bond between India and Nepal, enhancing intelligence collection sharing, investing in cybersecurity defense, and leveraging economic measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a growing chorus of policymakers and analysts who argue that the Russian military holds the initiative in the war in Ukraine and will likely triumph. As one U.S. academic contended, “the United States and the West more generally and Ukraine have lost in the war over Ukraine,” and “the Russians are going to win.” Dmytro Kuleba, a former Ukrainian foreign minister, remarked that unless the current trajectory changes, “we will lose this war.” In addition, some U.S. policymakers have concluded that Russia has “all the cards.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, Russian President Vladimir Putin has boasted that Russia is decisively winning on the battlefield: “Overall, we can clearly see what is happening right now. Our troops have the strategic initiative along the entire contact line.” He continued that “we have reason to believe that we are set to finish them off. I think that people in Ukraine need to realize what is going on.” Andrei Kartapolov, head of the defense committee in the Duma, Russia’s lower legislative chamber, followed Putin’s comments with threats that if Ukraine did not accede to Russia’s maximalist demands in peace negotiations, Ukrainian leaders would be forced to listen to “the language of the Russian bayonet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand the state of the war and Russia’s battlefield performance, this analysis asks: How successful has the Russian military been in achieving the Kremlin’s objectives? What factors have contributed to this outcome? To answer these questions, this assessment examines several indicators of Russia’s battlefield performance: the relative rate of advance of Russian forces, the size of Russian territorial gains, the scope of equipment losses, and fatality and overall casualty rates. The evidence suggests that Russia has largely failed to achieve its primary objectives and has suffered high costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Russian forces have advanced an average of only 50 meters per day in such areas as Kharkiv, slower than during the Somme offensive in World War I, where French and British forces advanced an average of 80 meters per day. Russian rates of advance have also been significantly slower than during such offensives as Galicia in 1914 (1,580 meters per day), Gorzia in 1916 (500 meters), Belleau Wood in 1918 (410 meters), Leningrad in 1943 (1,000 meters), and Kursk-Oboyan in 1943 (3,220 meters). Even Russia’s rate of advance in parts of Donetsk Oblast, averaging 135 meters per day, has been remarkably slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Russia’s seizure of approximately 5,000 square kilometers of territory in Ukraine since January 2024 has been paltry—amounting to less than 1 percent of Ukrainian territory—and has occurred mainly in Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kharkiv Oblasts. Russia’s marginal gains are particularly noteworthy compared to its conquest of 120,000 square kilometers during the first five weeks of the war and Ukraine’s recapture of 50,000 square kilometers in the spring of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Russia has lost substantial quantities of equipment across the land, air, and sea domains, highlighting the sharp matériel toll of its attrition campaign. Since January 2024, for example, Russia has lost roughly 1,149 armored fighting vehicles, 3,098 infantry fighting vehicles, 300 self-propelled artillery, and 1,865 tanks. Even more noteworthy, Russian equipment losses have been significantly higher than Ukrainian losses, varying between a ratio of 5:1 and 2:1 in Ukraine’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, Russian fatalities and casualties have been extraordinary. Russia will likely hit the 1 million casualty mark in the summer of 2025—a stunning and grisly milestone. Overall, a high of 250,000 Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine, with over 950,000 total Russian casualties, a sign of Putin’s blatant disregard for his soldiers. To put these numbers into historical perspective, Russia has suffered roughly five times as many fatalities in Ukraine as in all Russian and Soviet wars combined between the end of World War II and the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. In addition, Russian fatalities in Ukraine (in just over three years) are 15 times larger than the Soviet Union’s decade-long war in Afghanistan and 10 times larger than Russia’s 13 years of war in Chechnya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s poor performance has likely been caused by several factors: the Russian military’s reliance on dismounted infantry and mechanized forces to take Ukrainian territory, Russia’s failure to use operational fires in a coordinated way that enables maneuver, and Ukraine’s effective utilization of defense in depth. For the United States, increased sanctions on Russia and continuing U.S. and European military assistance to Ukraine would likely raise the costs for Moscow of a protracted war and could facilitate peace talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this analysis is divided into three sections. The first examines Russian objectives and the Russian way of war in Ukraine. The second section analyzes four indicators of Russian military performance: the average rate of advance, the amount of territory seized, the amount of equipment destroyed, and total fatalities and casualties. The third section provides broader implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-russian-way-of-war&quot;&gt;The Russian Way of War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Putin’s primary objective is likely to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere of influence, either directly by militarily conquering and annexing Ukraine or indirectly by installing a Russian ally in Kyiv. Putin has been clear and consistent in claiming—falsely—that Ukraine is not, and has never been, an independent country with a distinct culture, history, religion, or language. In his article “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians,” Putin noted that Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarussians are descendants of Ancient Rus and “bound together by one language (which we now refer to as Old Russian), economic ties . . . and—after the baptism of Rus—the Orthodox faith.” Paraphrasing the Russian writer Nikolai Gogol, Putin asked, “How can this heritage be divided between Russia and Ukraine? And why do it?” Putin continued that “there was no historical basis” for “the idea of Ukrainian people as a nation separate from the Russians.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After failing to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s orbit by seizing Crimea in 2014 and then using a combination of regular and irregular military units in eastern Ukraine, Putin resorted to a conventional invasion in February 2022. The Russian military was unable to swiftly defeat Ukrainian forces through a blitzkrieg campaign and has since resorted to an attrition strategy to conquer Ukrainian territory and defeat the Ukrainian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A war of attrition is one in which a belligerent attempts to wear its opponent down through piecemeal destruction of its military, including matériel and personnel. The essence of attrition is best described by Carl von Clausewitz, who wrote that it is a mistake to believe that there is “a skillful method of disarming and overcoming an enemy without causing great bloodshed.” Instead, Clausewitz contended that “war is an act of violence pushed to its utmost bounds” and that the side “that uses force unsparingly, without reference to the bloodshed involved, must obtain a superiority if his adversary uses less vigor in its application.” In attrition warfare, the belligerents are mainly concerned with overpowering their adversaries in a series of bloody set-piece battles that minimize exposure to enemy fire. These battles can be characterized by high casualties, massive expenditures of matériel, and limited movement of front lines. In attrition warfare, a successful offensive operation pushes the defender backward along a front line, much like a bulldozer. There is limited expectation of delivering a knockout blow in which a specific action quickly renders the opponent unable to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attrition can be distinguished from maneuver warfare, in which an attacker attempts to defeat an enemy decisively without relying on bloody set-piece battles to wear down the enemy. For example, Nazi Germany adopted a blitzkrieg strategy in the early phases of World War II to rapidly defeat France, Belgium, and other European militaries. The United States employed such a strategy during Operation Desert Storm in 1990–91 and Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, as did Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. While Putin may have hoped that Russia’s military would quickly defeat Ukrainian forces and topple the government in February 2022, it failed to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since early 2024, Russia has held the initiative in the war in Ukraine. As used here, “initiative” involves attacking—or threatening to attack—an enemy to force it to react or deny it the ability to act. As described by British Major R.G. Cherry, the initiative is also “the power of making our adversary’s movements conform to our own.” With the exception of some limited Ukrainian operations—most notably the cross-border incursion into Russia’s Kursk region in 2024—Russia has generally been on the offensive since January 2024 (and even in some areas, such as Avdiivka, since October 2023). During this period, Russia’s offensive campaign has involved several components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Russia has used dismounted infantry (including human wave attacks) and mechanized forces to wear down and attrit Ukrainian lines by killing and wounding Ukrainian soldiers, destroying equipment, undermining morale, and otherwise targeting Ukraine’s capacity to fight. Russian forces have also utilized small first-person-view (FPV) and other drones, artillery, glide bombs, and a range of other stand-off weapons. A glide bomb is a low-cost, conventional bomb modified with deployable wings and a relatively inexpensive global navigation satellite system guidance kit. Glide bombs have been particularly deadly at penetrating Ukrainian airspace and hitting targets because of their speed, low thermal profile, and ability to saturate defenses when fired in large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6DbIGRd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Ukraine Battlefield Map, June 2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the tactical level, Russian units have routinely conducted advances using small squads of troops, often poorly trained, that are supported by armored vehicles or light mobility vehicles. These forces can include company tactical groups, modified tactical breakthrough groups, and special assault detachments. Higher Russian headquarters frequently order these forces to advance toward Ukrainian positions to conduct reconnaissance by drawing fire. If the soldiers encounter resistance, Russian military commanders may assess the best lines of approach and boundaries—including the seams—between defensive units. If Ukrainian positions are positively identified, Russian soldiers are then routinely sent forward to attack positions, which are further mapped and then targeted with artillery, FPV drones, and glide bombs. When rotation or disruption of the defense is achieved, Russian units aim to conduct more deliberate assault actions. These tactics have led to high fatalities and casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Russia has utilized stand-off strikes from ground, air, and naval platforms to terrorize Ukrainian civilians through a punishment strategy. Examples include cruise and ballistic missiles (fired from Tu-160 and Tu-95MS bombers, Tu-22M3 bombers, MiG-31K fighters, and Su-34 fighters), strike and reconnaissance unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), small FPV drones, and artillery fire. But the Russian military has not used long-range fires effectively to shape the battlefield and set the conditions for maneuver warfare. As one CSIS analysis concluded, “Despite inheriting a military doctrine steeped in deep battle, reconnaissance-strike complexes, and precision noncontact warfare, Russia has consistently failed to employ operational fires in a way that reflects this legacy. Instead, firepower has become unmoored from maneuver.” In addition, the Russian military has suffered from weak coordination of units and a lack of battlefield flexibility and initiative of soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian forces have also imposed significant costs with their defense in depth in a war that has largely favored the defending side. Ukraine has used trenches, dragon’s teeth, mines, and other barriers—along with artillery and drones—to attrit advancing Russian soldiers and vehicles. Figures 2a and 2b show Ukrainian defensive positions—including trenches and dragon’s teeth—near the town of Andriivka in Donetsk Oblast in eastern Ukraine during a Russian offensive operation. Dragon’s teeth are anti-tank fortifications formed by truncated pyramids, usually made of reinforced concrete, designed to impede the mobility of main battle tanks and other vehicles. Ukrainian tactics are premised on extending the depth of their fires and dispersing their force to avoid casualties. In response to the threat from fires, Ukrainian units have dug in extensively to reduce force density. Ukraine has also conducted several stunning operations, including smuggling drones deep inside Russia and using them to target and destroy Russian Tupolev bombers in June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2b: Ukrainian Dragon’s Teeth Near Andriivka, Donetsk Oblast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has some advantages with a substantial industrial base and an ability to mobilize a much larger number of soldiers. Nevertheless, the Russian military has struggled to conduct ground force operations at scale, overcome prepared Ukrainian defenses, or break through Ukrainian lines to achieve operationally significant gains. The Russian military has also faced challenges with force quality and the loss of experienced officers. In spite of heavy losses, the Kremlin has likely pinned its hopes of winning on a U.S. decision to end its military assistance to Ukraine. The next section turns to a more systematic analysis of Russia’s battlefield performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-battlefield-performance&quot;&gt;Russia’s Battlefield Performance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section uses four indicators to measure Russia’s progress since January 2024: the rate of advance, the amount of territory captured, the amount of equipment lost, and total fatalities and casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rate of Advance:&lt;/strong&gt; Russia’s rate of advance since January 2024 underscores the difficulty of breaking through entrenched defenses. This analysis estimates the average daily rate of Russian advance by measuring the straight-line distance that the front line shifted during specific campaigns in Ukraine. For each case, the measured distance is divided by the number of days of the campaign to calculate the average rate of advance in meters per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the Donetsk front in the east, Russia launched a renewed offensive in October 2023 and captured the fortified city of Avdiivka in February 2024 after one of the war’s most intense battles. From that point through April 2025, Russian forces advanced approximately 60 kilometers westward toward the city of Pokrovsk—an average of just 135 meters per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s progress has been even slower near Kharkiv in the north. In November 2024, Russian forces launched an offensive around the city of Kupiansk, crossing the Oskil River and pushing westward in an effort to encircle the city. Over the next five months, they advanced roughly 8 kilometers at the furthest point, averaging just 50 meters per day. Elsewhere along the front line, Russia has made little to no progress pushing Ukrainian forces back since January 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figures 3a–3d show the battlefield near the town of Andriivka in Donetsk Oblast, where Ukrainian forces destroyed a column of Russian armored vehicles in early April 2025. An explosion disabled the lead vehicle, which blockaded the remaining vehicles along the T-0428 Andriivka-Novopavlivka highway. Russian infantry dismounted from the vehicles and Ukrainian forces targeted them using drones and artillery. Roughly 12 Russian armored vehicles and tanks were destroyed or damaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3d: Destroyed Russian Vehicles Near Andriivka, Donetsk Oblast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slow pace of Russia’s recent advances is part of a broader pattern that has defined the war in Ukraine. Both sides now operate along extensively fortified front lines featuring dense minefields, trench systems, anti-armor obstacles, and fortified artillery positions. These defenses impose severe costs on attacking forces and dramatically limit potential breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, during the first year of the war in 2022, surprise and the absence of fortified defenses in many areas allowed attackers to maneuver more freely and achieve rapid breakthroughs in sweeping offensives. For example, during the initial phase of Russia’s invasion from February to April 2022, Russian forces advanced approximately 120 kilometers south from Belarus toward Kyiv, averaging about 3,120 meters per day. Along a separate axis, they advanced roughly 250 kilometers west through Sumy and Chernihiv toward Kyiv’s eastern outskirts, an average pace of 6,675 meters per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, in the fall of 2022, Ukraine conducted multiple successful offensives. In the north, Ukrainian forces retook the city of Kharkiv and surrounding areas in a blistering offensive that advanced an average of 7,400 meters per day. Around the same time, Ukrainian forces advanced an average of 590 meters a day in the south, retaking the city of Kherson and surrounding territory. More recently, Ukraine’s Kursk offensive illustrated the benefit of attacking with surprise against unprepared defenders, as Ukrainian troops advanced roughly 30 kilometers into Russia in three weeks, an average of approximately 1,250 meters per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s slow and limited advances since January 2024 are most comparable to Ukraine’s own offensive in the summer and fall of 2023, which managed to push forward at a rate of just 90 meters per day against heavily fortified Russian positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 4 illustrates these trends by comparing the average rates of advance for major operations in Ukraine since 2022 alongside historical benchmarks from World War I, World War II, and the Yom Kippur War. Russia’s ongoing Kupiansk offensive has advanced at barely more than half the rate of the Allied forces in the Battle of the Somme in World War I, one of the most grinding offensives of the war. Even the relatively faster Avdiivka–Pokrovsk Russian offensive moved much slower than several historical campaigns, such as the U.S. offensive in the Battle of Belleau Wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CG4BReW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Rates of Advance for Selected Combined Arms Offensives, 1914–2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Territorial Gains:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to its slow rate of advance, Russia’s territorial gains since January 2024 have been modest. Russia’s largest gains have come in the east, where it captured the city of Avdiivka and has continued to push westward toward Pokrovsk. Over the course of this offensive, Russia has seized approximately 3,100 square kilometers. In the northeast, Russia’s operations to encircle Kupiansk since November 2024 have captured approximately 500 square kilometers. Along the entire front line, Russia has captured less than 5,000 square kilometers since January 2024. By April 2025, Russian territorial gains had slowed down, with Russian ground forces seizing an average of roughly six square kilometers per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By comparison, these territorial gains are far smaller than those that occurred in earlier phases of the war. For example, at the peak of its initial invasion in March 2022, Russian forces had seized approximately 120,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory in less than five weeks. By the end of April 2022, Ukraine had retaken approximately 50,000 square kilometers. Later that year, Ukraine’s Kharkiv and Kherson counteroffensives reclaimed roughly 17,000 square kilometers combined in approximately 11 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like its slow advance, Russia’s modest territorial gains since January 2024 indicate the difficulty of breaking through entrenched defenses and sustaining large-scale offensive operations in today’s battlefield environment. In contrast to the large exchanges of territory experienced in the first year of the war, fighting in 2025 is characterized by a grinding contest of attrition, where even limited territorial shifts typically require months of battle and offer few opportunities for decisive breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Equipment losses illustrate the high cost Russia has paid since January 2024 for its modest gains. As shown in Figure 5, Russia has lost substantial quantities of equipment, highlighting the steep matériel toll of sustaining offensive operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rEEjCqm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 5: Equipment Losses by Type, January 2024–April 2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attrition ratios of Russian equipment losses to Ukrainian equipment losses show the relative intensity of attrition across different phases of the war. Figure 6 plots the quarterly ratio of Russian fighting vehicle losses to Ukrainian losses based on visual confirmations. A value above 1 indicates Russia lost more matériel than Ukraine, and the higher the ratio, the more lopsided and costly Russia’s operations were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dgQ88zK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 6: Loss Ratio of Russian to Ukrainian Fighting Vehicles Over Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Russia’s initial invasion, the ratio hovered just under 4:1 as Russia’s thrusts toward Kyiv burned through fighting vehicles far faster than Ukraine lost its own. The ratio dropped in the fall of 2022 to around 2:1 when Ukraine went on the offensive at Kharkiv and Kherson and incurred higher losses. A smaller crest followed in early 2023 as Russia escalated its assault on Bakhmut, followed by another dip in the summer of 2023 during Ukraine’s Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia counteroffensives. The steepest spike appeared in late 2023 and early 2024, rising to a ratio of nearly 5:1 when Russia captured Avdiivka. Since mid-2024, the ratio has generally declined and in May 2025 it was approximately 2:1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes in the Russian-to-Ukrainian fighting vehicles loss ratio underscore the growing inefficiency of Moscow’s invasion. In early 2024, Russia experienced loss ratios higher than those it suffered during its initial 2022 invasion in exchange for only a fraction of the territorial gains. Russia’s offensives since January 2024 have yielded only marginal territorial gains but consistently suffered unfavorable loss ratios. The disparity points to the challenge of attempting repeated frontal assaults into well-prepared defenses and Russia’s reliance on mass rather than maneuver. Russia has attempted to offset these losses by greatly increasing its domestic defense production and supplementing with foreign supplies, including from China, Iran, and North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Kremlin appears willing to absorb high attrition in a bid to outlast Kyiv, the sustained disproportionate equipment loss rate erodes its capacity to generate fresh, high‑quality formations for the decisive breakthroughs it still seeks. Since January 2024, Russia has traded vast quantities of equipment for mere meters of ground—a strategy that decisively falls short of Moscow’s objective to greatly expand its control of Ukrainian territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatalities and Casualties:&lt;/strong&gt; Russia has also suffered significant fatalities and casualties. As Figure 7 shows, there were as many as 250,000 Russian fatalities in Ukraine between February 2022 and May 2025, compared to a high of roughly 50,000 total Soviet and Russian fatalities in all wars combined between World War II and February 2022. That means that Russia has suffered as many as five times the number of fatalities in Ukraine (in just over 3 years) as in all Russian and Soviet wars combined since World War II (covering roughly 77 years). No Soviet or Russian war since World War II has even come close to Ukraine in terms of fatality rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Wy51z39.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 7: Russian Fatalities in Selected Wars, 1946–2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, over 950,000 Russian soldiers have been killed and wounded since the war began. As Figure 8 highlights, Russia’s daily average of casualties has increased every year since 2022. However, many of the soldiers killed and wounded in Ukraine are from Russia’s Far North, Far East, and prisons—and are not the children of Moscow and St. Petersburg elites. Putin likely considers these types of soldiers more expendable and less likely to undermine his domestic political support base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian fatality rates are also high at between 60,000 and 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed, with a total of 400,000 casualties (which include both killed and wounded).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/w4vdR6j.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 8: Russian Daily Average of Casualties, March 2022–April 2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russia-does-not-hold-all-the-cards&quot;&gt;Russia Does Not Hold All the Cards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has struggled in Ukraine. As this analysis shows, Russian military forces have failed to significantly advance on the battlefield, seized limited territory, lost substantial quantities of equipment relative to Ukraine, and suffered high rates of fatalities and casualties. Russia has paid an extraordinary blood price for seizing less than 1 percent of Ukrainian territory since January 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian attrition has likely been caused by several factors: Russia’s reliance on dismounted infantry attacks to take Ukrainian territory, Russia’s failure to employ operational fires in a way that facilitates maneuver, and Ukraine’s effective defenses and tactics in a defense-dominant war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin’s main hope to win on the battlefield is for the United States to cut off aid to Ukraine and walk away from the conflict. Moscow’s aspiration is likely grounded in the U.S. decision to end aid to the Syrian opposition around 2015–16 (which allowed the Russian- and Iranian-backed Bashar al-Assad regime to defeat most insurgent forces) and the U.S. decision to withdraw from Afghanistan in 2021 (which allowed the Taliban regime to overthrow the Ashraf Ghani government in August 2021).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wars of attrition frequently come down to mass and defense industrial mobilization. As the historian Paul Kennedy wrote in The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, it is “incontestable” that “in a long-drawn-out Great Power (and usually coalition) war, victory has repeatedly gone to the side with the more flourishing productive base—or, as the Spanish captains used to say, to him who has the last escudo.” The victorious side is often the one that can more readily replace the soldiers and equipment—including artillery, air defense systems, munitions, and armored vehicles—that are lost in huge numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet even in cases when attrition warfare is ultimately successful, it has huge costs. Winning a war of attrition requires a willingness to absorb considerable casualties and significant losses of equipment. In Ukraine, Russia has some advantages in population size and industrial mobilization, particularly with the help of China, Iran, North Korea, and other countries. European and U.S. aid is critical for Ukraine, and an end of U.S. assistance would likely tip the balance in favor of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Moscow does not hold all, or even most, of the cards. It has at least two vulnerabilities that the United States and Europe could better exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is Russia’s economy. Russia is grappling with stubborn inflation, labor shortages, and limited paths to economic growth. The country’s economy is seriously exposed in oil and gas, which make up between 30 percent and 50 percent of Russia’s total federal budget revenue. Increased sanctions against Russia’s energy sector—including sanctions against any country that buys Russian oil (what policymakers call “secondary sanctions”)—would likely cause major pain. One analysis estimated that secondary sanctions against Russia would cause Kremlin oil revenues to drop by 20 percent while raising gasoline prices in the United States only 15 cents per gallon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy sanctions could be combined with sanctions against other Russian exports, such as minerals, metals, agricultural goods, and fertilizers. Some members of Congress, such as Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), have introduced legislation that imposes additional primary and secondary sanctions against Russia. The legislation includes up to 500 percent tariffs on imported goods from countries that buy Russian oil, gas, uranium, and other products. The United States and Europe could also seize approximately $300 billion in frozen Russian assets and use them to provide Ukraine with sustainable assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second Russian vulnerability is the blood cost of a protracted war, particularly if it erodes Putin’s political support base. As this analysis has outlined, Russia has suffered massive numbers of fatalities and casualties. If Moscow continues to drag its feet on peace talks, a U.S. decision to provide more weapons, intelligence, and training to Ukraine would escalate Russia’s battlefield costs. U.S. Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), 155-mm artillery rounds, air defense systems, and other weapons systems and intelligence assistance have seriously complicated Russia’s offensive campaign. And unlike the forever wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States has not lost any soldiers in Ukraine. American military assistance has also benefited workers in Arizona, California, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, and other states where these weapons systems are developed and produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet despite Russia’s vulnerabilities, the United States has failed to wield either the economic or military cudgel. Without serious pain, Putin will continue to drag the peace talks out, keep fighting, and wait for the United States to walk away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States holds many of the cards in Ukraine. It just needs to start playing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Trump administration makes a generational change in U.S. grand strategy, it should create a new map of the world that better aligns military activities to that strategy. The current command structure is inefficient and slow—designed for an era when the United States’ military was larger and threats were more easily contained and geographically aligned. As a result, increasing lethality will require more than just cutting the number of general officers and consolidating headquarters. It requires a new framework for seeing the world. It requires a new map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making a new map starts with a bureaucratic document unknown to most Americans that has significant consequences for global security architecture: the Unified Command Plan (UCP). Every two years the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) initiates a review of the UCP. Sometimes there are sweeping changes, like creating new functional commands to address cyber and space operations. Other times, the UCP adjusts regional priorities, such as the creation of the U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) in 1983 and the U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) in 2007. And proposed reforms—both today and in years past—generate intense debates in Congress and across the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As strategy changes, the map the Pentagon uses to align military power to national security interests should change. The Trump team is correct to call for bold changes to the UCP. In fact, substantial changes have the potential to improve command and control, flexibility, and adaptability for day-to-day competition and war fighting while modestly reducing costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two possible ways to achieve these gains are to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;consolidate combatant commands, giving each four-star commander broader responsibilities to better manage competition; or&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;shift to a more global approach that abolishes regional commands in favor an integrated global command focused on waging modern joint all-domain campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principal trade-off between these approaches is placing a greater emphasis on border security and day-to-day competition versus prioritizing preparation for global war against a rival great power. That is, should the United States manage its defense commitments by prioritizing a “world of regions” or visualize and describe military strategy using a single map focused on preparing for a global war, most likely with China? This global competition in turn would require mission-focused commands that adapt to the threat across different regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Trump national security team aims to prioritize addressing immediate threats—through measures such as strengthening border security, using security cooperation to shape strategic conditions, and conducting deterrence operations—it should consolidate the combatant commands (CCMDs) and better align operation, activities, and investments in support of regional competition. This approach focuses on the most likely course of action: day-to-day competition and using military forces to deter adversaries and support partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if preparing for protracted, global conflict is more important, it should eliminate regional CCMDs and focus on a single global struggle that requires synchronizing effects across domains. This approach prioritizes the most dangerous course of action and sacrifices gaining access and reassuring partners regionally for a more a direct approach to securing U.S. interests globally through mission-aligned task forces that constantly evolve and adapt. The trade-off is regional nuance for global focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these approaches are not mutually exclusive, the difference is one of prioritization and how best to align authorities, command structures, and the marginal defense dollar. Both of these options reduce the current number of commands, lower the number of four-star officers, and reduce the burden of manning service component headquarters. And any restructuring should focus on improving the efficacy of the command structure to ensure political leaders have access to adaptive and dynamic military options in lieu of cumbersome, and often stale, plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the path chosen, there are additional steps the Trump national security team could take to support improved flexibility and adaptability. Most importantly, the team should add two deputy secretaries of defense (DSDs) for current and future operations who have command authority over sections of the department. This will make the Department of Defense (DOD) more agile by allowing faster decisions for current and future operations, essentially enabling greater decentralized execution, which is necessary for large bureaucracies. This simple change also reserves the defense secretary’s time for the thorniest, most strategic issue: determining when to sacrifice the future for the present, or vice versa. This added bureaucratic layer is only helpful if the DSDs have decisionmaking authority. They must be in the chain of command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military has an extremely broad range of global responsibilities across many functions, which creates demands for the secretary to lead an organization larger than several small countries. This reality means the secretary should push many day-to-day decisions to lower levels so he can focus on the long-term strategic issues and one or two immediate priorities. Placing DSDs in the chain of command with some budgetary control creates a structure to facilitate lower-level decisions for many issues. The current limited number of civilians in the U.S. chain of command—numbering just one or two for the military services—is offset by numerous, equivalent four-star military commanders and over 40 four-star officers, which President Donald Trump and Congress should reduce. Consolidating several combatant commands in either of the ways this report describes offers potential savings. After all, three-star generals lead the militaries of several small countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the authors firmly believe these changes will improve the effectiveness, agility, and efficiency of the DOD, the department needs to quickly conduct additional classified analysis and war gaming with congressional staff to ensure the production of a new UCP and National Defense Authorization Act within a year to codify these revolutionary adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report proceeds by providing an overview of the UCP’s history and reform debates. It then provides two options for substantially reforming the UCP. The report concludes by listing major recommendations the Trump administration should consider regardless of the path it takes to redraw its military map of global competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-history-of-a-military-map&quot;&gt;The History of a Military Map&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon’s military map of world is the UCP. President Harry S. Truman approved the first UCP in 1946—then known as the Outline Command Plan. The original plan called for a Far East Command (FECOM) for Japanese occupation, along with a Pacific Command (PACOM), Alaskan Command, Northeast Command, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (later Atlantic Command, or LANTCOM), Caribbean Command, and European Command (EUCOM). From the beginning, drawing lines to focus military operations on a global scale led to service conflict. In the early years, this conflict centered on whether to place the Mariana Islands and Bonin under PACOM or FECOM, a fight largely defined by rival service perspectives between the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army. This trend continued over the decades and included failed efforts by the U.S. Army to raise the status of Military Assistance Command Vietnam to a unified command supported by PACOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a map, the UCP addressed not just physical boundaries but complex coordination questions involving emerging military capabilities. Control over strategic forces—from nuclear weapons to space and cyber capabilities—has long plagued planners. As early as 1946, Army Air Force officers advocated for a Strategic Air Command (SAC) operating globally, seeing the alignment as reflecting the principles of mass and unity of command as well as hard lessons learned in World War II. This premise was subsequently challenged by the U.S. Navy, which argued that ballistic missile subs must work alongside other ships, leaving them subordinate to fleets in LANTCOM, EUCOM, and PACOM. The debate came to a head in 1960 when the secretary of defense gave the commander-in-chief, Strategic Air Command (CINCSAC), the director, Strategic Target Planning a U.S. Navy deputy rather than creating a unified command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar debates defined the emergence of space and cyberspace as war-fighting domains, with a mix of defense analysts and Congress alongside military members trying to align emerging technologies with their war plans and service priorities. Command structures to manage operations in space evolved within the U.S. Air Force between the 1960s and the creation of Space Command in 1985. The command emerged in parallel with President Ronald Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative. The command was officially closed in 2002, with space missions transferred back to the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) until Congress approved a measure to reestablish it in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest in separate military capabilities aligned to cyber missions emerged from the fallout of a war game. Eligible Receiver 97—an early cyber-focused exercise—created deep concerns about systematic vulnerability in the DOD, leading to the creation of the Joint Task Force Computer Network Defense (JTF-CND) in 1998. The entity evolved into a JTF working for the U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM) until it transitioned to USSTRATCOM in 2002. In 2009, then–Defense Secretary Robert Gates directed the reorganization of service cyber forces, including merging two separate cyber task forces to form the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This history provides crucial context for thinking about reforming the UCP. Historically, changing trends—from the emergence of space as a war-fighting domain to the invention of cyberspace—and shifting regional threat dynamics have pushed defense officials to rewrite the UCP and create new maps of how best to align military power with strategic interests. The United States stands at the cusp of a similar moment in 2025. As a result, the DOD should consider sweeping changes to the UCP to streamline day-to-day competition and war-fighting activities while modestly reducing costs. While this report discusses two options for consolidation, the administration could also consider a third option: mission-oriented CCMDs, building on the work that think tank Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) completed in 2024 and provided to Congress and the National Security Council. Fewer CCMDs with appropriate authorities give combatant commanders (CCDRs) the ability to streamline decisionmaking and move resources between priorities as requirements shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ucp-reform-debate&quot;&gt;The UCP Reform Debate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given its division of the world into neat lines and attempts to synchronize multiple domains, the UCP has historically been a lightning rod for defense debates. Most of these involve disputes about territory, forces, and freedom of action (i.e., authorities as well as command and control). Substantial adjustments to the UCP have the potential to improve effectiveness and reduce costs if carefully considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first debate centers on whether the military should organize its force around geographic regions (i.e., territory) or functional missions and capabilities (i.e., force) lines. This relates directly to strategy, force posture, unity of effort, and operational art, as it impacts how military formations are organized, commanded, deployed, and employed across theaters. Within this debate is a second order question of whether to organize forces around one, global fight or a series of flexible regional contingencies. At one extreme, forces resemble the McNamara-era efforts to establish a unified command over all general-purpose forces in the United States focused on joint training, experimentation, and mobilization exercises. At the other extreme is a base force construct built around regionally aligned formations or even a world of a single global wartime commander.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second debate concerns practical questions: How large and broad should each command be? Where should the lines be drawn functionally and geographically? The larger the command, the more flexibility the commander has to shift resources between the different responsibilities owned by the command. However, this also means the commander has less time to focus on important but often less urgent issues. If a commander is responsible for fewer countries or functions, they have space for more subject matter expertise but will also need to make tough prioritization decisions or recommendations when trade-offs are necessary. There is ongoing tension between CCMDs having a clear focus versus flexibility to respond to global challenges that cross traditional geographic boundaries and domains. For example, is it better to have separate space and strategic commands or one, merged entity? Over time, this tension has emphasized a clear but relatively narrow focus, leading to functionally and geographically aligned commands that struggle to support global campaigning and are top heavy—led by four-star commanders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question of command arrangements becomes more central with the emergence of joint all-domain operations and global campaigning. Today, war against another great power will cross all functional commands and many, if not most, regional combatant commands. In this world, there are likely advantages to fighting as a single combatant command using a single joint task force with one combined joint air force component and land component. There are different advantages to using a series of small, subunified commands and task forces with flexible authorities and shifting areas of operation. The concept of subunified commands has been used, for example, to support global cyber operations as well as to focus on specific mission areas like the Combined Joint Task Force–Horn of Africa. According to a Government Accountability Office study, historically combatant commands have relied on subordinate commands for mission management and execution, leaving one to wonder if a series of more adaptable joint interagency task forces, led by ranks as low as colonels to as high as four-star generals, might perform as well or better than CCMDs in combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-a-new-map&quot;&gt;Toward a New Map&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report proposes two UCP reform options: (1) modest consolidation of the current CCMDs, retaining a focus on theater shaping and deterrence, or (2) eliminating regional CCMDs to improve lower-level coordination between fighting elements during war. The principal trade-off is the level of emphasis on border security and day-to-day competition relative to preparing for war with a great power. While day-to-day competition focuses on deterrence and has links to war plans through nested competition activities, the relationship is at best indirect and often difficult to measure and assess. A more direct focus on war fighting would reduce the emphasis on day-to-day competition and security cooperation. In practice, this would mean fewer partner exercises and more time spent rehearsing aspects of major plans and experimenting with emerging capabilities. Regardless of which option the Trump team pursues, the DOD would benefit from additional bureaucratic reforms to make the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) more agile, including by creating additional DSDs with command authority over CCMDs and the military services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ccmd-consolidation&quot;&gt;CCMD Consolidation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consolidating CCMDs runs contrary to the United States’ recent history of creating more CCMDs to ensure every important issue has the strongest advocate. However, these expansions effectively created grade inflation—too many issues require a four-star advocate and resolution requires the secretary of defense or president, the only individuals authorized to resolve disputes between CCDRs or task CCMDs. Thankfully, the DOD can do many things with consensus; however, consensus is rare when making trade-off decisions. Reducing the number of CCMDs has the potential to modestly reduce DOD costs and, with appropriate changes in authorities, significantly improve operational and strategic efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sCsLt0r.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Current Combatant Commands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merging several CCMDs will not change the importance of each region and could recreate the past problems that drove CCMD proliferation. Therefore, consolidating CCMDs must coincide with substantial changes to authorities and culture to avoid past problems. Each CCDR needs the ability to shift resources between the problems their CCMD is responsible for, and leadership must accept that CCMDs cannot solve every problem. Reasonable consolidation could turn the current 11 CCMDs into 6, which should reduce the number of decisions the secretary needs to make and streamline meetings for the secretary and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It also would streamline key forums like the “tank”—Joint Chiefs of Staff meetings—which often include 11 combatant commanders, 6 service chiefs, the CJCS, the vice chairman, and many of the Joint Staff’s three-star principals (e.g., J2, J3, J5). The large number of senior leaders in each meeting often limits meaningful discussion, as time is needed to give every leader an opportunity to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rn83M1Y.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Proposed Revision of Combatant Commands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes assume that consolidation can drive prioritization and integration. Larger geographic areas allow regional-oriented CCMDs to better manage assigned forces and engage partners. This regional perspective better aligns with campaigning and the use of operations, activities, and investments to deter adversaries and reassure partners. This will not significantly reduce the workforce because the CCMD will still need experts for all the issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consolidated, functionally oriented commands provide a way to compete in space and cyberspace, as well as to conduct deterrence operations in a synchronized manner. Campaign-related activities in space can be integrated with ongoing cyber campaigns to better deter or encourage specific adversary actions. The current authorities required to conduct space and cyberspace operations can be delegated to three-star commanders reporting directly to the four-star commander of STRATCOM. An alternative would be to keep nuclear-related capabilities separate and distinct but merge cyber and space capabilities. The question again is one of emphasis and prioritization, and is only answerable by the president given his understanding of security and how best to align military capabilities to advance his grand strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making this aggregated structure work requires appropriate delegation to empowered deputies. Each region or function needs a three-star deputy CCDR with the authority to direct activities within their area of responsibility. Without command authority, consolidation provides limited operational benefit. Overall, this structure supports the mission command and decentralized execution that senior military leaders routinely advocate for. Delegating most authorities and responsibilities frees the CCDR to focus on issues affecting all subordinate elements, set strategic priorities, and resolve trade-offs. The CCDR can, and should, withdraw authority when the strategic environment dictates. Three-star generals have sufficient experience and gravitas to provide command and control of daily activities for competition, lead war planning, and manage most other tasks. The military only promotes individuals to three-star general if they have the ability to manage a large organization. Four-star generals have the skills and experience for a broader focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, this approach has worked before—for example, when the EUCOM commander was responsible for Africa, Israel, and Europe. The commander quickly and efficiently adjusted headquarters efforts between these regions as the situation warranted. Prior to the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, the EUCOM staff and the commander focused heavily on North Africa, which had the most prominent threats at the time. However, when the Israel-Lebanon conflict broke out, commander and staff time shifted rapidly to the conflict. Once the conflict ended, there were fewer priorities, operations, and CCMD decisions related to EUCOM’s responsibilities in its narrow slice of the Middle East. As a result, EUCOM resources and attention shifted quickly back to North Africa. Ironically, when AFRICOM stood up, many of the North Africa experts at EUCOM stayed in EUCOM because those experts occupied billets allocated for Middle East responsibilities. A similar reaction occurred when there was a substantial counterterrorism threat in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consolidating the National Security Agency and the Cyber, Space, and Strategic Commands will cause consternation, given that they were recently separated (in 2010 and 2019). However, that was before Space Force existed, and consolidation assumes empowering three-star leaders for each of these organizations. All of these organizations have significant interdependencies and exist in highly compartmented environments, which makes evaluating consolidation a complex but worthy task for official channels. These 3–4 missions remain paramount for the future and current fight—after all, CYBERCOM is fighting an active war every day—but U.S. three-star generals have incredible talent and can manage these issues. The United States appears to have made these commands four-star positions to emphasize their importance and improve their bureaucratic influence in an inflated bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While consolidation has the potential to allow faster decisions and adaptation to changing situations, Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) needs to remain independent. Few outside the military understand TRANSCOM’s importance because its mission is viewed by too many as boring and technocratic. However, TRANSCOM punches well above its weight; the old adage that “amateurs talk tactics, professionals talk logistics” remains true. TRANSCOM provides the professionals and clear technical advice necessary for every CCMD, Joint Staff, and secretary. Having observed many conversations about war preparations, the DOD needs a command to objectively articulate the concrete logistical trade-offs for prioritization decisions between CCMDs. Most combatant commands make value judgments based on strategy and their priorities. TRANSCOM provides the hard math regardless of the value judgment, which is probably why it houses the Joint Enabling Capabilities Command that supports every CCMD when crises strike, from nuclear plant disasters (Fukushima, Japan) to military invasions (Russia-Ukraine) to hurricanes (Katrina) to counterterrorism (Iraq). Outside professional military circles, few understand TRANSCOM, but it is a vital CCMD for managing logistics and sustainment support, as the DOD learned through the Nifty Nugget exercise in 1978. These competing interests have not changed since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special Operations Command (SOCOM) would largely remain as is, with responsibility and authorities for global Special Operations Forces (SOF) activities and service-like responsibilities (e.g., procuring SOF-specific equipment). SOCOM would continue to work with the Joint Staff and CCMDs to ensure SOF activities advance peace-time objectives, set conditions for successful war fighting, defeat counterterrorism threats, and generally support global priorities effectively. In some cases, SOF capabilities will support lower priorities when those capabilities lack efficacy against higher priorities. Coordination with CCMDs and embassies will remain crucial to prevent conflict with other U.S. activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary advantage of consolidation, beyond headquarter reductions, is allowing CCMDs to prioritize resources against threats within their responsibility according to strategic guidance from the secretary and president. Consolidation will reduce the need for decisions by the secretary and president and free them to focus on grand strategy and global issues. This should not affect crisis response, where SecDef or POTUS will pull specific decisions up to their level—a normal and sensible reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important consolidation risk is the potential to deprioritize important tasks. Every CCMD has significant responsibilities. However, U.S. three-star generals are eminently capable of commanding large organizations if given sufficient authorities. Streamlining requires cuts somewhere. The greatest consolidation risk is even slower decisionmaking, which could occur if four-star commanders retain this authority for everything and their three-star deputies become another bureaucratic layer to traverse. Empowering three-star deputy commanders with the default authority to make all decisions except those narrowly, and explicitly, reserved to the CCDR provides the best chance to minimize this risk. Additionally, replacing four-star commands with three-star ones reduces the number of support staff and helps flatten organizational structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;global-combatant-commands&quot;&gt;Global Combatant Commands&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although consolidation could improve command and control, CCMD responsibilities are based on historical threats and technologies. Twenty-first century threats are global and do not conform to UCP boundaries. From great powers to violent extremist organizations (VEOs), threats have access to weapons and means that allow them to exploit the gaps and seams created by the current joint command arrangements. All command and control arrangements are designed to optimize the military’s ability to accomplish tasks in the most efficient and effective manner possible. Rather than optimizing for efficiency or effectiveness, the current UCP construct limits operational commanders’ ability to exploit what their units can do while forcing the secretary of defense to make tactical level deconfliction and deployment decisions. If an enemy commander responsible for the Eastern Mediterranean imposed the current boundaries on the DOD, he would receive a medal for forcing U.S. tactical commanders to coordinate between three CCMDs before acting. The current system has too many exploitable seams that U.S. adversaries actively exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States funds its military to fight a single major theater war at a time, but has eight theater-level headquarters, including Korea and NATO. Because of the current and projected size of the military, the United States only needs a single, dedicated four-star Operational Level command (OPCOM) to employ forces globally against an adversary. This would prevent adversaries from exploiting the seams between CCMDs, allow streamlined operational decisions, and reduce costly force structure. In this “task based” approach, all remaining four-star commanders have global “functional,” rather than regional, responsibilities. Although regional commands remain necessary, they would have narrow authority and be limited to two- or three-star peacetime “shaping” and “competition” commands that support all four-star commands as directed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These smaller regional commands would lose combatant command authority (COCOM) but would tactically employ forces provided by the Services and four-star commanders. The regional commands would have no permanently assigned forces or obligation to monitor or coordinate operational fires, maneuver and effects, etc. Using a portion of the force structure savings, the DOD would activate a four-star level Operational Level Warfighting Command, or OPCOM, in the United States to exercise command authority over any forces deployed outside the country for combat. OPCOM would be the only four-star command with the full suite of joint subordinate commands—such as a joint land component, joint maritime component, and joint air component—allowing for further cost and structure savings. The Pentagon would only employ geographic UCP boundaries with two- or three-star coordinators to meet peacetime “conditions setting” requirements; geographic UCP boundaries would have no bearing on OPCOM’s ability to employ forces or assign priorities. Regional commands consistently ask for any force available, regardless of the national strategy. Reducing the rank of regional commanders will make it easier for the Pentagon to make decisions based on long-term strategy instead of immediate, but rarely vital, crises. Four-star commanders have significantly greater ability to push the system to ignore strategic priorities for immediate demands because only an extremely busy secretary or even busier president have the authority to overrule a CCDR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An OPCOM structure will operate differently than current command constructs. In a war with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) or Russia today, U.S. forces would have difficulty attacking Russian or PRC extended lines of communication along the “Belt and Road” countries because multiple CCMDs must deconflict forces and effects. This friction may be acceptable against opponents who cannot operate with advantage in all domains, but would likely cause the United States to lose a war with the PRC or Russia. A single OPCOM would be better positioned to conduct war planning; for example, the operational design and operational art tasks of choosing where and how to use forces without bias for or against any specific region. Today’s CCMDs have an incentive to prioritize their area of responsibility first—only the Pentagon (OSD, Services, and Joint Staff) really look at the world holistically. Additionally, OPCOM’s limited responsibilities for day-to-day competition activities would allow greater focus on preparing to conduct combined, joint all-domain conflict under the toughest conditions. Today, immediate competition requirements often, and appropriately, pull the focus of CCMDs from the important but longer-term war-planning and preparation activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This OPCOM construct would likely require another nation to fulfill the four-star Supreme Allied Commander Europe role that the EUCOM commander holds today. While it would be difficult, it would not be impossible to reassume the role during a major theater war if a NATO nation were attacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to lesser threats, a three-star Joint Task Force (JFT) could likely handle most situations. A JTF built around the 5th Fleet could likely handle a conflict with Iran given Iran’s lack of global capabilities. Similarly, a three-star JTF supporting South Korea’s armed forces should be sufficient until the PRC or Russia become significantly involved, which OPCOM could address. Special Operations Command has sufficient capabilities to deal with the long-term and acute threats from violent extremist organizations while existing O6-O9 tactical headquarters could form the core of a JTF to handle other unforeseen contingencies short of a great power conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to streamlined command and control, the OPCOM approach’s primary advantage is improved resilience. Moving operational command and control to the United States would fully leverage the nuclear shield against long-range strikes and provide the National Command Authority additional distance to determine the extent of a U.S. commitment with less concern for U.S. forces in immediate contact with a threat. These changes would also free senior leadership to focus on strategy and not referee CCMD requests for forces and reclamas. Additionally, this would reduce requirements for service component commands because there would be less need for regional combatant commanders to receive advice on service force employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the major benefit is a single command focused on fighting a global war. A single command would, by definition, be better placed to fight the way emerging joint concepts, including the Joint Warfighting Concept and Joint All-Domain Operations, imagine. This command could rapidly synchronize pulse attacks across domains and, given longer weapons ranges and space and cyber effects that are less fixed to terrestrial geography, quickly shift priorities. The command could better align smaller JTFs dynamically stood up to seize local opportunities, for example targeting People’s Liberation Army (PLA) terrestrial space assets outside of China like downlink stations and space ports, and manage a global blockade designed to limit the flow of resources to Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are disadvantages to this proposal as well. Reducing the role of the regional commanders would likely create perception of regional disinterest since the change would be perceived and portrayed as a retreat back to “Fortress America.” Maintaining the subject matter experts in the middle ranks (military and civilian) should limit the loss of regional expertise. Such a move would also require a substantial culture change in the U.S. military, which has operated with the current model since the 1980s—a period longer than the careers of nearly all serving military officers. A final challenge would be blending the new structure into existing alliance relationships such as Europe and South Korea, where the U.S. regional commander holds a coalition leadership role. However, this last challenge also provides a potential opportunity if the United States wants to lower its costs for supporting international alliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aligning-the-national-security-enterprise&quot;&gt;Aligning the National Security Enterprise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside fundamental changes to the UCP, reorganizing the OSD without growing the overall staff size could address concerns CCDRs, their staffs, and the National Security Council frequently raise about slow DOD decisionmaking. Currently, approximately 16 individuals report directly to the secretary and 19 individuals report directly to the sole deputy secretary. Importantly, the secretary must approve any dispute between CCDRs, even over a single military dog team. The secretary’s span of control is far too large, which forces him to make too many decisions and creates an unacceptably slow decisionmaking process. Providing the secretary with three empowered deputy secretaries, in the chain of command, provides the best way to mitigate this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oIcwTlV.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Revised DOD Organization Chart Without Deputy Secretaries.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: The chart shows a potential DOD organization structure without additional deputy secretaries and streamlined to six combatant commands. In this structure, all conflicts between combatant commanders or service secretaries require secretary involvement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/w6PQTMS.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Revised DOD Organization Chart With Deputy Secretaries.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: The chart shows a potential DOD organization structure with deputy secretaries and six combatant commands. The secretary only needs to resolve conflict between services and combatant commands or around issues over which he chooses to retain all decisionmaking authority.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current OSD staff capacity can produce far more decision memos than the secretary can review and act upon. For example, the secretary ordered a CCMD to make an adjustment in a meeting coordinated and attended by the office of one of this report’s authors. However, the CCMD staff refused to follow the secretary’s clear verbal guidance to their commander and the OSD staff until they received official written guidance from the secretary himself to “prevent miscommunication,” which wasted several weeks and hundreds of staff hours. Having deputy secretaries who can task service secretaries, CCDRs, and agency heads would substantially mitigate this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One DSD could be responsible for current operations and make decisions when CCMDs disagree. A DSD for future operations could lead the services to manage trade-offs between services while overseeing service manning, training, and equipping functions. Service needs and CCMD needs would still come into conflict, but the two DSDs would be able to consolidate current and future issues to make a clearer decision for the secretary. More importantly, a DSD focused on the services would provide a stronger service perspective in many senior decision forums. A third DSD could have authority over major issues affecting the defense enterprise, such as finances, auditing, and the information technology backbone.1 Ideally, this DSD could focus on upgrading and streamlining the DOD’s information technology to improve productivity across the department. The OSD already has offices and staff that cover these issues, but few decisionmakers. Although assistant secretaries of defense (ASD) and under secretaries of defense (USD) are 4-star equivalents who have influence, they reside outside the chain of command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than the current system, where the services control the vast majority of funding, each DSD should control a portion of the overall budget established by the secretary. This would enhance the secretary’s influence over the budget and help encourage trade-offs between services for similar mission functions. Additionally, this construct would provide a stronger pathway for CCMDs to advocate for funding of near-term priorities. This should include providing CCMDs with a method to “bid” to use extant forces while providing a clear market signal for what CCMDs truly value. These adjustments also enhance the secretary’s power by pushing less important decisions to empowered DSDs, which would allow the secretary more time to focus on major strategic issues, such as determining how to apportion funding between current and future priorities and any other issues the secretary prioritizes. When the secretary takes on a major issue, like Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles, the DSDs can keep everything else moving. Overall, adding two DSDs and empowering them should substantially improve the benefits of CCMD consolidation without adding large additional staffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is entering a new era of great power competition that demands more than marginal reform—it requires a new map. The current UCP reflects the world as it was, not as it is becoming. Designed for the post–Cold War moment and stretched to address everything from terrorism to near-peer rivalry, the combatant command structure has become a bureaucratic labyrinth. Each node—each four-star billet—fights for attention, resources, and relevance. Instead of generating clarity, the system multiplies friction. If Washington wants to win in the era of systems warfare and strategic competition, it must reimagine the machinery of defense—starting with the architecture of command. The recommendations that follow aim to generate more flexible options for national leadership, rebalance the relationship between current operations and future force design, and create an institutional structure that can think, compete, and adapt at the speed of relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the DOD should significantly reduce the number of four-star CCMDs and broaden the responsibilities of each four-star commander. The CCMDs give greater emphasis to their specific problems; however, the proliferation of “priority” problems has created an arms race for bureaucratic power instead of improved prioritization and subject matter expertise on each issue. Consolidating the CCMDs into three regional commands and three functional commands provides the best first step. These consolidated CCMDs should have additional budgeting authority to purchase munitions or commercially available solutions that do not create a long-term sustainment bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the secretary or Congress should create a deputy secretary of defense (DSD) who is in the chain of command for all of the Combatant Commands (largely current operations focused) and another who is in the chain of command for all of the services (largely future focused). Each of these DSDs would have budgetary responsibilities for the entities they are responsible for. The primary purpose of these DSDs would be resolving disputes between CCMDs or Services in accordance with secretary and presidential guidance. Today, there are too many four-star commanders with appropriately different priorities that the secretary must adjudicate. The system generally works well for important and urgent problems, but all other decisions move at a glacial pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the options outlined in this paper require immediate attention by an interagency planning team to assess their viability. This team could—within 60 days—offer concise recommendations for the next UCP. If the DOD has more time, then a more sustained, deliberate effort should be undertaken by a mix of think tanks and federally funded research and development centers to ensure that the secretary has access to a broad range of perspectives, as well as insights from war games, that can inform the FY 2027 NDAA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the interagency team should also confront one of the most overlooked barriers to strategic coherence: the fact that the Department of State and the Department of Defense use different maps to see the world. This is not just a bureaucratic artifact—it is a strategic liability. When diplomats and war fighters operate on mismatched regional boundaries, they create seams that adversaries can exploit and that allies find confusing. The result is a series of missed opportunities and diminishing marginal returns in everything from security assistance to crisis response. If the United States wants to operate as a truly integrated state actor in a contested world, it needs to align its cartography. Harmonizing these maps would enhance interagency planning, create shared mental models, and help forge more coherent campaigns that blend defense and diplomacy across regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reforming the Unified Command Plan is a way to support the Trump administration’s desire for a smaller, more focused federal government and national security enterprise. However, such an effort should rest on interagency coordination and rigorous analysis, including ideas outlined in this report and past work completed in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2022. This report provides a starting point for discussion and analysis, not a final answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The designers of the current UCP faced a different international situation, a different range of threats, different communication tools, and a different speed of events. Today, the U.S. administration anticipates a need to shift U.S. grand strategy to be more agile and efficient while also better aligning with changing international conditions. Administration officials have clearly signaled a desire to lower international commitments today to preserve and expand economic strength for a potential great power conflict with the PRC tomorrow. This “reordering” of national strategy will create the largest change in the international system since 1945. Fewer resources will also require the DOD to do less with less on a daily basis. Therefore, the DOD must operate differently so it can rapidly adjust training and operations as the international situation and presidential priorities change. Operating differently requires an updated military command structure to effectively use the resources the American people have given the DOD. As U.S. national strategy evolves, the military instrument must adapt to support that strategy if it is going to meet the moment. Form should always follow function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 12 May 2025, the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) announced its decision to dissolve and end its armed struggle against the Turkish state. The announcement followed the PKK’s 12th Congress, held from May 5 to 7 in northern Iraq, and came after a February call from the group’s imprisoned leader, Abdullah Öcalan, who urged the organization to lay down arms. This followed an unexpected call by right-wing nationalist leader and government coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli, who in October last year suggested that Öcalan could be granted parole if he renounced violence and disbanded the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the group’s statement, the PKK’s struggle “brought the Kurdish issue to the point of resolution through democratic politics . . . As a result, activities carried out under the name “PKK” were formally terminated.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ending the four decades-long armed conflict, the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) process now expected to take place in the coming months is conceptually straightforward, yet translating this into practice in post-conflict settings is fraught with complexities. Recent trends in comparative counterinsurgency and DDR studies offer some insight into the challenges and strategic opportunities that may lie head for Turkey but will also serve as an important case study to inform future counterterrorism efforts and wider US and UK interests in the region. Comparative cases demonstrate that success can vary significantly based on local conditions and levels of political will across stakeholders. The interplay between DDR and peacebuilding processes with longer political horizons is also a factor, when it promotes legal reforms that can address the root causes behind the conflict and avoid a relapse into violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 12 May announcement does not explicitly outline a roadmap for the laying down of weapons, rather, it references disbandment, and the end of armed struggle in favour of the beginning of a new phase of democratic political struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish media reported that the PKK has around 3,500 members in northern Iraq. Fighters are expected to hand over their weapons to designated verification centres as Ankara works with Baghdad and Erbil to oversee the process. It is expected that this will also include a phased withdrawal of the PKK from its controlled areas in Iraq, such as Qandil, Gara, Sinjar, and Makmur, in a process coordinated by Turkey’s National Intelligence Organization (MIT) and Armed Forces. Media reports suggest that around 100 senior leaders may be sent to third countries, while around 2,000 members without active arrest warrants or egregious criminal records are expected to return to Turkey, where they will be subject to prosecution under counterterrorism laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kurdish conflict presents a complex case for the effective prosecution of DDR. An examination of other international conflict resolution and DDR processes highlight three potentially complicating factors in relation to the PKK, a designated terror organisation by Turkey, the US, UK and European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the PKK has overseen a transnational conflict involving national and subnational dynamics in Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran. This distinguishes it from most other post-conflict DDR processes since the late 1980s, such as those in Mozambique (1992), Liberia (2003) Nepal (2006), and Colombia (2016), which came in the aftermath of mainly internal conflicts. The protracted civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) stands out as having transnational dimensions with DDR processes explicitly dealing with regional fighters. The Sierra Leone-Liberia DDR efforts were also deeply intertwined regionally, given the cross-border flows of combatants. Conflicts with transnational dimensions are more complex and harder to resolve than purely internal or bilateral conflicts. However, the number of fighters to be demobilised is relatively small compared with other cases, rendering a successful outcome more likely. By comparison, around 70,000 fighters from different rebel factions were demobilised by the international community in Sierra Leone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the PKK’s origins and evolution as mainly an armed self-determination actor will influence the trajectory of its political transition. The organisation’s stated ideology has undergone significant pragmatic shifts – from its roots as a separatist movement in the late 1970s, to seeking autonomy in the 1990s and 2000s, and now, in its current phase, advocating for democratization within the state’s existing borders. Post-conflict-transitions involving actors with some form of self-determination-claims have shown the need to address wider demands for political reform beyond DDR to achieve stability and avoid recidivism. A Marxist-Leninist organisation at its inception, the PKK’s ranks are filled with fighters that undergo strict ideological training, practice martyrdom culture, and valorise a cult of personality around Ocalan. The concept of “devoted actors” within armed-conflict- and rebel-group-studies suggest that fighters motivated by deeply held, non-negotiable commitments to the organisation’s cause may either resist demobilisation or struggle with reintegration processes unless there are targeted policies to “flip” allegiance or facilitate a transition to non-violent forms of political contestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, relevant conflict resolution and terrorism scholarship argues that the way in which conflict comes to an end can influence the sustainability of the transition and stabilisation phase. In the modern era, terrorist groups have typically ended through hybrid policy instruments, including military force, reduced public support, disruption of illicit financing, and diplomatic pressure on external sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;terrorism-termination-and-democratisation&quot;&gt;Terrorism Termination and Democratisation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ankara views the dissolution of the PKK as the outcome of the state’s military victory in line with its security doctrine, intelligence gathering and counterterrorism strategy, which meant the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) narrowed the PKK’s area of action and operational capabilities in the Qandil mountain range and territory in northern Iraq. However, some within the PKK movement, including Murat Karayilan, a co-founder and a top commander, have interpreted the decision differently. He recently claimed that the PKK had not been defeated militarily, that the PKK had new war tactics and had developed its technological capabilities. While denouncing armed struggle, Karayilan said laying down weapons was contingent on the Turkish state codifying legal guarantees. Should this narrative gain traction among the PKK’s rank and supporters, it may undermine the level of commitment to disarmament protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the explanations cited for the decline or termination of terrorist groups is the achievement of the group’s aims. However, following the collapse of the two-year ceasefire in mid-2015 and the return to armed violence in Turkey’s southeast, the PKK failed to achieve its aim after taking a maximalist posture and unilaterally declaring autonomy across several towns and villages. Turkish special police and gendarmerie forces carried out a counter-insurgency operation. The PKK intensified its attacks, and the violence reportedly resulted in more than 3,800 reported fatalities in 2016. Turkey’s security doctrine intensified following this phase in the conflict with increased cross-border air operations inside northern Iraq – codenamed Claw (2019), Claw-Lightning and Claw-Thunderbolt (2021), and Claw-Lock (2022) – that systematically targeted PKK infrastructure. Turkey also conducted military operations since 2016 inside northern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the PKK’s armed insurgency aimed at establishing autonomous areas inside Turkey failed operationally, the group lost public legitimacy, and it retreated geographically from Turkey into areas of control in northern Iraq, where it became vulnerable to Turkish airpower campaigns and drone strikes. While there is scepticism among some in Turkey about the PKK’s long-term intentions, even after disbanding, the organisation’s failure to achieve its core aim – and its shift away from autonomy demands now – combined with the assessment that it is militarily weaker than it has been are factors that may enhance the likelihood of success for the current process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, there are concerns that the PKK’s self-declared “disbandment” may mean different things to different actors. Since the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime, the situation on the ground in Syria has been shifting rapidly. These changes have created opportunities for the PKK’s announced disbandment and for advancing the “Terror-Free Türkiye” process. However, Turkey’s position is that the PKK’s Syrian offshoot, People’s Protection Units (YPG), the armed unit of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), must equally heed Ocalan’s call to disband. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said the declaration should apply to all PKK-affiliated groups: “We consider this announcement to encompass all of the organization’s branches, including those in northern Iraq, Syria and Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the PKK’s formal announcement, the SDF commander Mazloum Abdi welcomed the move as a step towards a “new political and peaceful process in the region,” Consistent with his long-standing position that the SDF is a distinct entity, his message implied that his forces were not bound by the PKK’s decision. On 19 May, the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK), the Iranian offshoot of the PKK announced that it would not disarm despite the decision of its parent organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This apparent contradiction risks undermining the wider process unless it is resolved through a negotiated settlement. Nonetheless, two cost-benefit calculations enhance Ankara’s commitment to effective implementation of the PKK’s disarmament. First, the dissolution of the PKK marks a historic milestone, bringing an end to an organisation that primarily targeted the Turkish state and the conclusion of a costly four-decade-long counter-terrorism campaign. Second, Ankara anticipates that the YPG-SDF will be incorporated into the Syrian central army and state institutions, with Turkey coordinating this integration with the Ankara-friendly interim government in Damascus. The extent to which the PKK’s disarmament and demobilisation process succeeds in the coming months will likely positively influence the integration of the SDF into the Syrian state-building process as a recognised and legitimate actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unresolved questions over how the PKK’s disbanding will impact the SDF in Syria is fuelling scepticism among some in Turkey that the outlawed militant organisation may gradually evolve under a different banner. Related to this is that PKK-linked splinter groups may operate in north-eastern Syria or Iraq, perhaps under Iranian patronage, particularly if power vacuums or ungovernable spaces emerge. Ankara can be expected to monitor activities in Kurdish-run areas in north-eastern Syria and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) and reserve the right to take military action against PKK remnants. This, however, would risk undermining stabilisation efforts in Syria and Iraq, underscoring the importance of a successful and verified disarmament process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen how the disarmament process will interface with democratisation outcomes in Turkey. What renders this case complex is that the disbandment decision arrived without a negotiated settlement or peace agreement, rather, constitutional reforms in Turkey are expected to be debated in parliament follow disarmament. On 27 May, a team of legal experts was appointed to work on a new constitution. The legal framework for managing the DDR process, along with the anticipated pro-democracy reforms, faces significant challenges as Turkish lawmakers navigate this uncharted territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PKK’s announcement of its intention to dissolve marks a pivotal moment in the protracted conflict and will have implications for peacebuilding in Turkey, Iraq and Syria. However, the current moment is a liminal one, throwing up dilemmas from the perspective of post-insurgency politics given uncertainties about how the reintegration phase will be implemented. And this is the part of the DDR process that is being discussed the least. How ex-fighters that may receive amnesty, for example, will integrate and select to pursue political goals will impact Turkey’s wider political system and carry consequences for prospects for democratisation. Conversely, prosecuting those who committed crimes and abuses during the conflict may lend greater legitimacy to the process and promote democratic principles. It is important to support policies that balance various grievances within the broader polity in Turkey and do so under parliamentary oversight, broad based political buy-in, and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-sdr-is-released-from-purgatory&quot;&gt;The SDR is Released from Purgatory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The much-discussed UK Strategic Defence Review (SDR) has recently been subject to a wearingly familiar succession of leaks and speculation, and now appears likely to be published in the week of 2 June. Through its gestation, the review has been dogged by concerns about delays caused by the changing global context, the level of its ambition, and the extent to which the government’s commitment on spending 2.5% of GDP would be enough to address the issues in Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the review was in its research phase, a trio of distinguished former UK officials set out a framework against which to judge it. Now the results of the review are imminent, how might it be read, and what should be examined as measures of success or challenge when it eventually sees the public light of day? In particular, how might its level of ambition for the “transformation” of the UK’s Armed Forces be judged?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;schrodingers-review&quot;&gt;Schrodinger’s Review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first area on which to evaluate the review is the manner of its presentation, particularly in its conclusions. The review is unusual in it is notionally independent, delivered by Lord Robertson as part of a trio of senior figures (Dr Fiona Hill and retired General Richard Barrons the other two), alongside a number of external experts and specialists, supported but not directed by a secretariat in the Ministry of Defence (MOD). They had free rein to make suggestions and propose ideas to change Defence, albeit they also have terms of reference – including a budget ceiling – within which to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These constrained the review, as did limited capacity (albeit bolstered by artificial intelligence summarising the thousands of submissions), but in the final analysis this should be a review less encumbered than previously by inter-service politics or the orthodoxy of the MOD. However, if media reporting is accurate, we can infer it was largely finished some time ago, but has been delayed until now by wrangling over how to implement it, what this means for the MOD’s finances, and how to present the subsequent work the MOD will need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was always the danger inherent in picking an independent team but running the review on behalf of the MOD: it could present politically difficult options. It is not feasible to only publish part of it, and cherry-picking will be obvious, leaving the alternative of watering it down. But if the report’s authors are lukewarm over the final results, or step away entirely, it will undermine its intellectual case, and lead to doubt about the government’s seriousness in approaching the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A completely independent review would not need government “sign-off” or “approval” from the Treasury. Of course, the Government might not have liked the conclusions, but much like a report from a Select Committee, a government response could have then applied budgetary realism or an alternative perspective and then engaged in the resulting open and (hopefully) educational public debate about priorities. Instead, we are left with something like “Schrodinger’s Review”: both independent and dependent at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategy-requires-making-choices-and-compromises&quot;&gt;Strategy Requires Making Choices and Compromises&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second area for judgement is its utility as a “strategic” document and whether the SDR is trying to be “a” strategy or not. If so, it should be read as an attempt to achieve the cliched but necessary balancing of “ends, ways, and means” for Defence: determining the purpose of the Armed Forces, how they should go about their business, and with what resources (inside a ceiling dictated to the authors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signs for this are not positive at the moment, given the previously-mentioned delay for discussions in the interval between the SDR’s conclusion and its publication. The terms for the review talk about prioritisation of objectives, investments and activity, which certainly sounds like important components for a strategy. But more recently, the Permanent Secretary of the MOD appeared to suggest details around investment decisions might not appear until the autumn in a separate, MOD-authored document, not least because the MOD is still trying to work out the shape of the revised Equipment Plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, it would be unreasonable to expect this work to both review all of Defence and perform the function of an MOD Budget Cycle in its totality. But given the challenges to the current structures and capabilities of the military, if it can’t even approach the level of detail of recent reviews in relation to capability choices (e.g. the 2010 and 2015 proposed future forces) then there is a danger it becomes too aspirational to be useful (or more cynically, too vague for the MOD to be held to account against it). We should therefore expect a “strategic” review to be about prioritisation, assumptions and guidance for choices. This is also where it is possible to judge the ambition and scope of the review’s conclusions, particularly on the use of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;money-alone-is-not-transformational&quot;&gt;Money Alone is Not Transformational&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This immediately brings up the most obvious cause for any caution about the short-term impact of the review. The spending target of 2.5% of GDP (which we now learn will also include money being spent to “lease” Diego Garcia, albeit as a tiny fraction (0.2%) of the Defence Budget) is not so significant an increase as to be genuinely “transformational” – at least, not given the current state of the Armed Forces. To be transformational, it will need to cut and significantly reshape the Armed Forces by taking risk in some areas to transform others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boost of several billion pounds a year should probably first be used to fill gaps: in ammunition and other weapons stockpiles; in infrastructure and housing; logistics and support functions; and in support to personnel conditions, pay and recruitment. To make radical, rather than incremental additions to military capability (for example in order to take advantage of new technologies) will therefore require some big choices on early retirement of capabilities or reductions in numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence has been here before in terms of the promise of new capabilities being presaged by the early loss of others due to budget pressure: the cuts of November 2024 were just such a case and given the modest savings made over five years, were an indicator of just how tight in-year finances are at the MOD. Before that, the Integrated Review and related Defence Command Paper both promised investment in “advanced technologies” would improve the forces – after a number of “legacy systems” were cut to make room. We have had years of talk of “sunset and sunrise capabilities” but rather than a planned and managed transition from older forces to new, the UK has instead been left with an eclectic mix of the cutting-edge sitting uneasily alongside the obsolete – for which replacements are often late, or, where weapons upgrades lag, new capabilities find their potential limited. This was not the planned “high-low mix” as part of an “integrated force” we were promised, but a classic British attempt to muddle through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implementation-needs-to-move-beyond-experimentation&quot;&gt;Implementation Needs to Move Beyond Experimentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is here the SDR could make a major mark. Never mind quibbling over the sufficiency of the 148 Challenger 3 tanks the UK will eventually have by 2030: given the experience of Ukraine does the SDR believe tanks have a future as currently envisaged? Are the Army’s expensive attack helicopters still worth it in a world where the front line is increasingly dominated by drone threats? If, as reported, the Navy wants to radically increase the number of uncrewed vessels for a variety of tasks, should it still be developing large surface combatants, and what role is envisaged for the aircraft carriers? And in air and space, might future surveillance capabilities be better provided by stealthy drones and space-based sensors rather than large, slow, vulnerable crewed aircraft such as the E-7 Wedgetail?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has talked a good game on experimentation and trials, including on artificial intelligence (AI) and directed-energy weapons, but these have yet to translate into large-scale production of any new capabilities operating outside of niche organisations. New processes and structures such as a Defence Innovation Unit, and an Integrated Procurement Model are being introduced, but will take time to show their worth: the MOD already had an innovation unit alongside other innovation centres, and the IPM’s acceleration of the DragonFire laser weapon came after it had already spent seven years being developed. At least the recent announcement of the new StormShroud drone coming into service represents the first major implementation of the RAF’s Autonomous Collaborative Platforms Strategy and is a significant improvement on the RAF’s over-hyped “drone squadron” which spent several years without conducting a drone trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ambitious-targets-for-change-are-needed&quot;&gt;Ambitious Targets for Change Are Needed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDR could help by making clear where the big bets could be made on technology – and where cold water needs to be poured on ideas that represent a triumph of optimism over reality. It could identify where “legacy” items have outlived their usefulness and where technological solutions will enhance existing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it should identify where mass and depth remain vital to the creation of effective fighting power: the inexorable reduction of force sizes combined with the increasing cost of systems is unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some advice on where either the expansion of forces and stockpiles are required, or acceptance of limitations will be necessary alongside collaboration with allies and partners. On this last point, there should be some consideration of how to survive friction in the critical relationship with the US; a complete break is in neither’s interests, and tremendously expensive but given the unique extent of the UK’s intertwining with the US military – and thus its vulnerabilities – some additional insulation is required if the US is less reliable or (not unreasonably) expects a more prominent role for Europe in its own security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do all this it may be necessary to set ambitious, and crucially, measurable targets. For example, what proportion of RAF combat aircraft should be uncrewed and by what year should this target be achieved? What functions in the Royal Navy should be handed over to remote or autonomous systems, and by when? The Army has reportedly already identified a target for the proportion of its combat power to be provided by traditional crewed capabilities (20%), reusable uncrewed capabilities (40%), and disposable drones (40%). But it is not yet clear how this metric is calculated, and it is hard to believe the first category will only comprise a fifth of total budget or firepower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other goals could be about testing the Defence Secretary’s claim that the UK will be at the leading edge of innovation on AI; for example, the widescale adoption of AI to complete all initial analysis of imagery, thus accelerating intelligence analysis, or the use of software to do initial operational estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Targets matter: although similar targets in the US have been missed, as has been pointed out, the fact they existed created a benchmark against which some aspects of modernisation could be measured. The statement by the Chief of the General Staff that he intends to double the Army’s combat power within three years is exactly the sort of target that focusses minds and could potentially be useful if they appear in the SDR, and can be measured (in this case defined as a brigade being capable of defeating a Russian Combined Arms Army).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if the MOD disagrees with these, for example, because it has a different understanding of the risks, or the speed at which technology might develop, then it should be asked to set out its own analysis, such as the probability AI smarter than people (Artificial General Intelligence) will arrive, the point at which this becomes more likely than not, and if never then why. The briefing this week that the MOD will develop a “Digital Targeting Web” to be in service in 2027 is a decent start, though if it is learning lessons from what Ukraine has been doing since 2022, and uses technology already available, is this fast enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is to suggest the SDR should purely focus on being a technologist’s manifesto. It also needs to make judgements on the state of the UK’s industrial base, and effective use of the UK’s reserves, amongst many other issues. We have not even mentioned the expense of the nuclear deterrent, its longevity and other options to improve deterrence in Europe. But many of the developments in UK Defence since the end of the Cold War have inevitably justified shrinking forces on the back of more advanced capabilities. Given we are now seeing the speed of adaptation and counter-measures in the war in Ukraine, it is reasonable to ask how this review will cut through the hype and myths and make concrete recommendations, using its independence to force change at a pace the MOD has been unable to demonstrate on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2025, the Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet), led by RUSI’s Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) in partnership with the Democracy Development Foundation (DDF), convened a multistakeholder roundtable in Yerevan, Armenia. The session brought together key representatives from Armenian public institutions, financial authorities, civil society and international partners to assess the country’s response to mounting geopolitical pressures, the enforcement of sanctions frameworks, and the vulnerabilities posed by illicit financial flows and electoral financing ahead of the 2026 parliamentary elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable was supplemented by a series of bilateral engagements and one-on-one consultations with representatives from Armenian commercial banks, the Ministry of Justice, investigative journalists, youth groups, diplomats and international think tanks. These discussions provided further detail and contextual depth. This report integrates insights gathered from all formats of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with previous SIFMANet roundtables across the EU and its neighbourhood, the Yerevan meeting offered a platform for candid, off-the-record discussions among senior officials from the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA), the State Revenue Committee, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, civil society organisations (CSOs), private sector representatives, and compliance professionals. The dialogue was informed by Armenia’s evolving geopolitical situation, including its close historical and economic ties with Russia and Iran, ongoing regional instability, and the increased scrutiny brought about by Western sanctions regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report synthesises the insights collected during the Yerevan roundtable and associated meetings, highlighting Armenia’s institutional innovations in sanctions compliance, the limitations posed by structural and political challenges, and the role of public–private coordination. Additionally, it identifies emerging risks in political financing, including the potential misuse of cryptocurrency and foreign-linked funding channels. These discussions have important implications not only for Armenia but also for neighbouring jurisdictions seeking to strike a balance between maintaining financial openness and safeguarding national integrity against malign financial influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;armenias-sanctions-landscape&quot;&gt;Armenia’s Sanctions Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;geopolitical-and-economic-context&quot;&gt;Geopolitical and Economic Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armenia’s geopolitical position presents a unique and multifaceted set of challenges, shaped by its limited open borders, unresolved conflicts with neighbouring countries, and a small, trade-dependent economy. These conditions present an operational challenge in imposing G7 sanctions on Russia. Participants underscored the Armenian government’s proactive stance in harmonising with Western sanctions frameworks (for example, introducing Government Decree 808-N), despite economic dependencies and regional dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armenia’s foreign policy is multi-vector and seeks to reconcile relations with global powers and neighbouring countries. The strategy has been strained due to continuous war with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, which has caused long-term displacement and regional instability. In addition, Armenia’s diplomatic relations with Turkey remain frozen due to Turkey’s support for Azerbaijan, and while there have been cautious efforts at dialogue, deep-rooted tensions continue to limit Armenia’s broader diplomatic and geopolitical outreach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closely linked to the aftermath of the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Armenia’s relationship with Iran has gone through meaningful change, evolving into a more strategic partnership. Participants highlighted key initiatives strengthening this cooperation, including the construction of the 7.2-km Kajaran tunnel, part of the international North–South Road Corridor, and several other major infrastructure projects. According to a diplomatic representative, while these ties benefit Armenia and Iran, they also align with Russia’s political interests, potentially complicating Armenia’s efforts to deepen cooperation with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These dynamics demonstrate the complexity of Armenia’s foreign relations, particularly in the context of its enduring alliance with Russia – a key strategic partner with ties spanning the military, political, economic and energy sectors. Participants noted that Armenia’s continued membership in regional alliances such as the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), the Commonwealth of Independent States, and the Collective Security Treaty Organization highlights the continuing depth of its institutional and geopolitical ties with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had a significant impact on Armenia’s economic ties with Moscow. Participants indicated that Armenia’s economy witnessed a significant acceleration, expanding by 12.6% in 2022 and sustaining a strong momentum, with 8.3% growth in 2023, before moderating to 5.9% in 2024. During this period, participants also highlighted the considerable expansion of trade with Russia – Armenia’s largest trading partner – which increased nearly fivefold from $2.6 billion in 2021 to $12.4 billion in 2024. It was brought up during the discussion, however, that this rapid growth has sparked apprehensions that Armenia may increasingly serve as a transshipment hub for goods subject to international sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid this rising scrutiny, participants mentioned that there has been a parallel surge in misinformation and disinformation targeting Armenia. Hostile foreign actors have been spreading false narratives, suggesting that Armenia is facilitating the circumvention of international sanctions. A representative from the Ministry of Justice stressed that these claims are unfounded, but they represent a considerable danger to Armenia’s global reputation. If left unchallenged, the representative noted, these claims could deter foreign investment and further complicate the country’s economic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter these challenges, Armenia has taken visible steps to illustrate its dedication to sanctions compliance. This has most prominently been accomplished through its financial sector. Representatives of the CBA suggested that Russia-owned VTB Bank and Iran’s Bank Mellat have been sanctioned. These banks are no longer connected to international networks such as Visa and Mastercard or US dollar transactions, and Armenian banks no longer have correspondent relations with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these actions fulfil formal compliance obligations, participants noted that legacy financial ties, particularly through remittances and cross-border transactions, continue to pose systemic risks. Armenia’s large diaspora in Russia, estimated at over 2.5 million people, is instrumental in sustaining financial flows between the two countries. A representative from the Ministry of Economy acknowledged that although remittances can be processed through a wide range of commercial banks operating in Armenia, other Russia-linked channels – informal, alternative, or non-sanctioned ones – still remain faster and more accessible, making them the preferred option for many in the diaspora. This reliance, however, has increasingly come into tension with Armenia’s sanctions commitments. As a CBA representative explained, Armenia has had to discontinue several widely used services to remain compliant with international obligations. One prominent example is “Unistream”, a Russia-based money transfer platform heavily used by the diaspora, which ceased operations in Armenia following US sanctions. In response to such disruptions, Armenian authorities are now working to identify alternative channels that strike a balance between accessibility and compliance with evolving international standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parallel to Russia-related concerns, Armenia’s increasing economic and trade relations with Iran pose concerns in the West about sanctions compliance. This is especially heightened by a new agreement between the EAEU and Iran. A private sector representative pointed out that the agreement is expected to streamline customs procedures, facilitate expanded trade and support the development of regional infrastructure aligned with member states’ economic interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Armenia remains committed to adhering to international sanctions frameworks. A representative from the CBA said that the country’s sanctions compliance efforts continue to meet international expectations. Recently, Armenia’s interagency working group reviewed the updated US National Security Presidential Memorandum (NSM-2), which provides guidance on reassessing licences involving Iranian entities. A CBA representative noted that while no violations have been identified within Armenia’s financial sector to date, this has been attributed to proactive derisking measures by Armenian banks, especially since most high-risk Iranian actors are already subject to UN sanctions. Nonetheless, the NSM-2’s broader implications for sectors beyond finance are still being assessed by the Armenian government, who are awaiting further engagement with US authorities to clarify the scope of enforcement and reassessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions compliance becomes increasingly important for Armenia as the country seeks to strengthen its ties with the EU and the US. Participants highlighted several key initiatives that have strengthened Armenia’s relations with the EU, including the Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement. They also noted that the Council of the European Union welcomed the European Commission’s decision in 2024 to initiate a visa liberalisation dialogue with Armenia. In early 2025, Armenia took another significant step in its foreign policy by signing a Strategic Partnership Charter with the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this political and diplomatic pivot toward the West, participants noted a stark disconnect on the economic front. While Russia continues to dominate Armenia’s foreign direct investments, Western countries have yet to make a significant economic impact. No major projects from the EU or the US have matched the scale of investments from Russia or Iran, which continue to act swiftly in executing their strategies in Armenia. Armenia has made efforts to diversify its investment sources; however, these gaps remain a persistent challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;export-control-the-linchpin-of-armenias-sanctions-enforcement-model&quot;&gt;Export Control: The Linchpin of Armenia’s Sanctions Enforcement Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armenia’s membership in the EAEU is making it difficult for the country to impose G7 sanctions on Russia. The free movement of goods and services among the EAEU member states provides potential avoidance of sanctions as the sanctioned goods can easily go through Armenia and other EAEU member states. This poses a challenge for Armenia to prevent sanctioned goods from flowing into Russia, reducing the efficacy of the sanctions and bringing into question Armenia’s role in facilitating such trade flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants emphasised that to address these challenges, sanctions compliance needs to be imposed at various levels in Armenia. They explained how responsibilities are shared among competent institutions. The CBA plays a key role in supervising financial institutions and in implementing compliance with sanctions, particularly in detecting and preventing suspicious financial transactions. The State Revenue Committee is responsible for overseeing the licensing process, and the Ministry of Economy enables the support to business subjects, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to comply with requirements. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plays a key role in coordinating policy and diplomatic cooperation with foreign counterparts to ensure Armenia’s compliance with international sanctions frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reinforce sanctions enforcement mechanisms, the CBA has also greatly improved its enforcement function. CBA members clarified that, in the absence of binding sanctions law, the bank has adopted internal compliance rules and heightened supervisory control through the use of audits. Risk-based guidance tools in compliance with Office of Foreign Assets Control standards have been distributed to financial institutions, supplementing sanctions screening procedures. The CBA has also strengthened its engagement with correspondent banks to maintain Armenia’s link to the international financial system as derisking pressures remain on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempting to circumvent sanctions is classified as a criminal offence under Armenian law, according to participants. During the discussion, attendees referred to the legal framework and noted that at the core of Armenia’s sanctions compliance framework is the Law on Control of Export and Interstate Transit of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies. This law, along with supporting Government Decree No. 924-N (July 1, 2010) and Government Decree No. 1785-N (December 15, 2011), provides the regulatory basis for Armenia’s sanctions compliance efforts. According to participants, these measures govern the movement of sensitive goods and technologies through Armenia, ensuring the country aligns with international sanctions obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were in consensus in naming two flagship initiatives that are the most important results of Armenia’s sanctions compliance. First, the adoption of Government Decree 808-N in 2023 was widely seen as a milestone in the creation of a more robust compliance system. The decree formalised targeted controls – particularly over dual-use items (Common High Priority List) – within a general strategy of monitoring and controlling exports with potential military applications. Second, Armenia’s establishment of a high-level interagency working group, chaired by the deputy prime minister, was mentioned as an accomplishment for institutional coordination on sanctions implementation. According to an official from the Ministry of Justice, the working group was formed in accordance with a 2023 government decree, with the aim of aligning Armenia more closely with the G7 sanctions regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also pointed to Armenia’s export licensing system as a central component of its sanctions compliance architecture. This regulation requires individuals and entities to obtain prior authorisation for the export of dual-use goods, irrespective of the destination, thereby reinforcing Armenia’s commitment to rigorous oversight and alignment with international sanctions regimes. From this foundation, Armenian authorities have introduced a set of pragmatic enforcement measures, such as transit declarations and electronic invoicing of air exports to EAEU destinations. Not only do these measures enhance the traceability of goods, but they also enable more efficient monitoring of exports, particularly those transiting or destined for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tighter control has already generated a measurable impact. A representative from the State Revenue Committee said that in 2023 fines were imposed on illegal exports of dual-use items, and as a consequence such exports to Russia had fallen dramatically, with volumes reportedly at near-zero. This is a desirable outcome that is testimony to Armenia’s growing ability to restrict illicit trade in sensitive goods. Still, however, the official highlighted that there are issues at play, primarily in detecting more sophisticated evasion tactics. One such issue is Harmonised System code manipulation, the practice of mis-stating commodities to avoid the prohibitions of sanctions. Such breaches, both intentional and inadvertent, underscored the necessity of building stronger technical ability on the part of traders and supply chain providers to detect and neutralise such actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In strengthening financial regulation in Armenia, another milestone was the acknowledgement of cryptocurrency as a possible avenue for illicit financial flows. Participants discussed the need for strict regulation in this case. One of the CBA representatives explained that the government is formulating overall policies for how to tackle these matters. This also includes the draft law on crypto financial assets, which has already passed on the first reading in parliament. The aim of this provision is to encourage security and order in the digital currency market to facilitate openness of ownership, source of funds monitoring, and safeguarding of the financial system against abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on Armenia’s increasing focus on the enforcement of sanctions, the role of the financial intelligence unit (FIU) has assumed a central position in addressing new risks and adhering to international frameworks. A key mechanism through which it achieves this is the analysis of suspicious transaction reports (STRs), which are filed whenever there are concerns regarding potential sanctions violations. According to a representative of the FIU, STRs are reviewed in the broader context of anti-money laundering systems and only reported if there is a clear suspicion of a link to criminal activity or illicit proceeds. The analysis of such reports has shown trends reflecting that individuals are involved in efforts to circumvent sanctions. Rather than engaging law enforcement directly at this stage, the FIU coordinates with the concerned department responsible for sanctions supervision to ensure preventive actions are undertaken where possible. While there is cooperation with foreign counterparts, for example, the Egmont Group, the representative acknowledged a gap in reciprocal investigation requests from foreign governments, which is a deficiency in Armenia’s overall sanctions enforcement system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;private-sector-response-and-unintended-consequences&quot;&gt;Private Sector Response and Unintended Consequences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armenia’s efforts to comply with international sanctions have had a wide-ranging impact on the country’s private sector. Following the sanctions on major Russian banks, Armenian financial institutions and trade operators have had to quickly shift how they connect to the global financial and trade systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent implementation of G7 sanctions, Armenian banks mainly used Russian banks as their correspondent banking relationships with the international financial system. Since these major Russian banks (notably VTB and Sberbank) have now been sanctioned, Armenian banks have had to rewire their connections to the international financial system. Although a US bank continues to provide this service to one Armenian bank, no other Western banks have been willing to step in to fill the gap left by the Russians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of sanctions has led to the introduction of more stringent procedures within Armenia’s banking system. Participants noted that while the measures are generally seen to be effective in imposing compliance with international sanctions, they also complicated banking procedures. An NGO representative commented that over the past three years, Armenia’s banking system has undergone a substantial tightening of regulatory practice, with financial agreements becoming more restrictive. This shift can be seen in the increased recruitment of compliance officers across the sector. In the meantime, these heightened demands have added layers of complication for entrepreneurs and citizens conducting their routine banking transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of sanctions is not only felt in the banking sector but also by small businesses and producers. According to a Ministry of Economy representative, these firms are now under more scrutiny, with banks asking them to identify their end customers before transactions are approved – a demand that is challenging for many small firms to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This intensified due diligence has translated into mounting operational pressures. Participants pointed to concrete obstacles such as delayed transactions, derisking by financial institutions and restricted access to correspondent banking services. These disruptions have had a disproportionate effect on smaller businesses, whose limited leverage and capacity make them more vulnerable to financial bottlenecks. One constant issue permeating participant discussions was the uneven enforcement environment: as larger businesses have generally been able to handle matters through unofficial networks or available ties, small actors remain in the position of lingering uncertainty and organisational disarray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants highlighted that Armenian businesses, particularly small ones, cannot survive without their economic connections with Russia, as the access to the EAEU market and Russian online stores still offers vital opportunities that are not readily available in European and American markets. This concern was repeated by a Ministry of Economy official and one MP, who quoted testimony from local businesses, a good number of which view Western substitutes as insufficient. The MP added that Western partners have not made a strong counter- offer, as yet, and most in the private sector view those alternatives that have been offered as lacking what is necessary to enable a serious move away from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of sanctions have also been felt acutely in the country’s IT sector. Participants noted that the industry has been disproportionately impacted by Western technology firms’ overcompliance policies, where they have cut back or entirely shut off their services or cooperation with Armenian counterparts based on perceived compliance risk. A representative of the Ministry of High-Tech Industry of the Republic of Armenia expressed concern over the UK’s warning to British exporters to avoid dealing with those that can assist in circumventing sanctions against Russia. Consequently, Armenia’s high-tech sector has suffered significantly, slowing its general development and making developments in the industry more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although significant steps have been taken by Armenia to strengthen sanctions compliance infrastructure, participants emphasised that sufficient monitoring of cash flows continues to be a key vulnerability. This concern was raised repeatedly as a systemic flaw with limited transparency of financial flows causing potential loopholes that might be exploited to bypass sanctions, highlighting the necessity for enhanced oversight tools and ongoing institutional capacity building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key point raised by participants was the role of public–private partnerships (PPPs) and cross-sector coordination in strengthening Armenia’s sanctions compliance efforts. It was underlined that there is already significant cooperation between the private and public sectors, which can form a solid foundation for progress. For example, the interagency committee, headed by the deputy prime minister, includes representatives from the private sector. It offers a platform for consultation on issues such as the risks sanctions pose to financial inclusion. A representative from the CBA noted that PPPs are extremely strong in areas such as anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing (AML/CTF). By the end of 2024, several meetings had been held to discuss the findings of the National Risk Assessment (prepared in advance of Armenia’s ongoing Financial Action Task Force/MONEYVAL evaluation), namely money laundering and terrorism financing risks, reflecting the growing institutionalisation of these collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with national efforts, regional cooperation was also considered essential. Participants emphasised the importance of enhancing data sharing and joint development of typologies of risk to more effectively identify and deter sanctions evasion. In preparation for the ongoing MONEYVAL evaluation, stakeholders recommended intensifying public–private dialogue, further enhancing national risk assessments, and drawing on international experience to align Armenia’s compliance practice with evolving global standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;election-integrity-and-financial-flows&quot;&gt;Election Integrity and Financial Flows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants highlighted enduring vulnerabilities in the country’s electoral finance system, as Armenia moves towards its 2026 parliamentary elections. The main issue focused on gaps in enforcement. While the legal framework is in place, stakeholders widely described its implementation as irregular and insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armenia’s Corruption Prevention Commission, tasked with supervising financial disclosures, faces serious limitations that risk undermining the integrity of elections. Among the primary issues, an NGO representative said, is the severe shortage of staff – typically, only one or two officials are assigned to scrutinise complex financial statements. This lack of resource seriously hampers the Commission’s ability to put its mandate into practice, causing delays in analysing asset declarations and impediments to their timely and transparent disclosure to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These institutional limitations are exacerbated by the comparative shortness of the official campaign period – only three weeks. The participants agreed that the brevity of this time period makes effective observation impossible and rules out a careful examination of election-related financial activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to structural and procedural flaws, participants also flagged issues about the application of campaign finance laws in Armenia. During previous election cycles, there were instances of apparent violations of campaign finance regulations that did not lead to significant consequences, raising concerns that similar issues might rise again. A representative of an NGO explained how a ban on corporate donations to election campaigns has been circumvented. In one case in 2018, two large factories were involved in questionable campaign finance operations, with investigations later showing that employees of the factories appeared to be contributors to political parties. This raised strong suspicions that their names were being used without their knowledge to conceal corporate interests and avoid the ban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter such transparency issues, a CSO representative deliberated on Armenia’s beneficial ownership transparency reforms as a way of raising accountability. Under the current regulations, all legal persons, including NGOs and private entities, are required to annually disclose their beneficial owners. The potency of this move is, however, undermined through weak implementation. According to a representative of the Ministry of Justice, the authorities currently lack the capacity and resources to verify whether the declared owners actually own the entities, thereby creating the opportunity for misuse and further complicating efforts to prevent illegal company donations and guarantee transparency in the election process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These past experiences, combined with experiences other countries have had with elections, have fuelled heightened concerns that foreign interference will escalate as the election approaches. Participants cited Russia’s efforts to interfere with the electoral process in Moldova, Georgia and Romania, and indicated that Armenia could be vulnerable to similar attempts. Among the principal issues raised was the potential for extraterritorial influence, such as online political advertisements financed from abroad. The NGO representative cited Russia’s use of 27,000 accounts in Moldova to interfere in the country’s elections and warned of the challenge of prosecuting such activity in Armenia’s elections outside its borders. In addition, CSO representatives pointed out techniques applied in Moldova, where individuals were reportedly encouraged to open bank accounts in Russian banks and were immediately credited with amounts ranging from €50 to €100. This represented a form of vote bribery, which made participants suspicious about the likelihood of Russia employing similar methods in Armenia, as the country has vulnerable groups facing financial difficulties who could be manipulated through such tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this array of concerns, the increased impact of media channels was added as a notably important line of foreign interference. Various new media channels, which participants assumed to be financed by Russian-affiliated interests, were spreading propaganda that corresponds with the Kremlin’s agenda. As one participant recognised, some media outlets adopt names suggesting pro-European interests while propagating anti-Western and anti-government themes. The participant gave the example of Euromedia24, a media source that, even with a pro-European name, has been working actively to disseminate anti-Western rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants agreed that Russian influence is not merely at the media level, reaching as deep into think tanks and NGOs. Such entities are accused of actively working against Armenia’s democratic reforms, frustrating peace and normalisation efforts with Turkey and Azerbaijan and threatening to destabilise the foundations of democracy in the country. Participants warned that the scope and intensity of such activities are likely to grow as the 2026 elections draw closer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another risk highlighted for the 2026 election financing system is its transnational ties to Russia’s large diaspora community. Participants warned that such bonds between communities can be used for unlawful political financing or interfering in elections. Remittances and unregulated money transfers are prevalent in Armenia, posing enormous regulatory difficulties. In addition, the beneficiaries of Russian financing may unknowingly be caught up in influence operations due to the absence of stringent controls to check against such abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further adding complexity to these risks, diplomatic officials raised concerns that Nagorno-Karabakh forced displacement provides increased numbers of vulnerable populations to be targeted. These communities are exposed to greater risks of manipulation by vote-buying and informal financial assurances that damage electoral integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key threat identified by participants is the presence of Iranian and Russian banks operating in Armenia, which produces alternative financial systems and deepens existing difficulties. The lack of transparency of such entities, combined with incomplete integration into the compliance system in Armenia, allows room for foreign actors to use them as backdoor conduits of finance to shape local political processes during election periods without being discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These foreign influence concerns are further fuelled by the Armenian financial regulatory system that, according to participants, leaves loopholes for illegal financing to find its way into politics. In response to these complaints, an FIU official explained that while the FIU’s mandate does not directly cover political parties or elections, their activity becomes relevant as and when suspicious signs of a crime – in the form of illegal enrichment or money laundering – are detected. In such cases, the FIU cooperates with the banking sector and law enforcement agencies. Armenian AML/CTF legislation prescribes specific high-risk categories, including politically exposed persons, by which financial institutions are allowed to apply automated screening systems and flag suspicious activity for deeper scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another threat on the horizon raised by participants was the use of huge cash payments and cryptocurrency as instruments of illicit election funding, which go undetected with ease. To address these growing threats, an FIU official disclosed that the unit is now using blockchain analysis software in tracking cryptocurrency transactions and searching for warning signs. In an effort to close continuing gaps, the FIU is working to develop mechanisms for better early detection and surveillance. In terms of cash transactions, the official noted that any transaction exceeding $10,000 must be declared, with the data inputted into the FIU strategic analysis systems to help identify anomalies as well as block systemic threats to financial integrity and the electoral process. As the election looms, civil society representatives have registered alarm over the lack of effective mechanisms to track and monitor illicit financial flows amid increased risks of foreign interference. CSO members urged authorities to strengthen coordination and cross-sectoral collaboration and further underscored the need for more cross-country collaboration between Armenia and other countries that face risks of foreign election interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the national efforts, participant discussions then turned to the role of international institutions such as MONEYVAL, considered to be one of the most important stakeholders in improving the electoral security of Armenia. MONEYVAL has so far been anti-corruption oriented, but participants emphasised the necessity for their agenda to be broadened to encompass electoral integrity. With an in-country evaluation to be conducted in October 2025 and the final report published in 2026, Armenia has a great chance to learn some meaningful lessons and gain valuable recommendations, presenting the country with a genuine chance to strengthen its mechanisms against electoral vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armenia finds itself at a financial and trade crossroads, caught between the West and the targets of sanctions (Russia and Iran) and facing financial headwinds that may threaten the integrity of its 2026 election. While the country has strong legislation in place, a financial sector that is alert to the threat posed by sanctions evasion, a vibrant civil society and an experienced anti-financial crime community, it will need to embrace a whole-of-society approach to bring together these capabilities to ensure the integrity of its financial system in the face of persistent and rising challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With his second term, Donald Trump is wasting no time in redrawing the global technological and strategic map. His high-profile tour to the Middle East combined old-school power politics and a new-age tech offensive. In Riyadh, he presided over a $142 billion arms package with Saudi Arabia, underscoring traditional security ties, but the centrepiece of his visit was something far more future-tech focused: artificial intelligence. From massive chips deals and cloud infrastructure commitments to the launch of state-backed AI champions, the trip marked a deliberate US push to entrench itself at the heart of the Gulf’s digital transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of the announcements was staggering. In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia unveiled Humain, a new national AI champion backed by the Public Investment Fund and boasting an initial procurement of a least 18,000 Nvidia Blackwell chips. In tandem, AMD inked a $10 billion infrastructure partnership, while Amazon Web Services committed $5 billion to build a dedicated AI zone in the Kingdom. Across the Gulf in the UAE, Abu Dhabi’s G42 firm, already a regional AI heavyweight, struck deals to import up to 500,000 Nvidia H100 chips annually, facilitated by eased US export restrictions. Qatar, not to be outdone, sealed the largest-ever Boeing deal in its history, signalling its own intention to remain central in US commercial and strategic interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This flurry of high-end tech deals represents more than just a set of business deals, it reflects a deliberate recalibration of US strategy, from export controls and tech denial under Biden, to a geoeconomic offensive that arms allies with cutting-edge capability. But in empowering Gulf monarchies with the tools of advanced AI, Washington is not just outcompeting China, it is taking significant long-term risks. These technologies could be repurposed for surveillance, repression or military use and their diffusion may ultimately undermine the very norms and alliances the US seeks to uphold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-pivot-from-denial-to-diffusion&quot;&gt;A Pivot from Denial to Diffusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration’s approach to AI and semiconductor policy was defined by strategic denial. Export controls against China, pressure on allies to restrict technology flows and a concerted push to multilateralise guardrails on AI development were the cornerstones of its international tech policy. Trump’s second term, by contrast, has begun with an aggressive pivot by easing export restrictions, dismantling tiered licencing systems, and facilitating US firms’ access to fast-growing, but politically sensitive, markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For US tech giants such as Nvidia, AMD and AWS, this is a bonanza. The Middle East, flush with oil revenues and motivated by existential concerns about a post-hydrocarbon future, offers massive capital, centralised decision-making and near limitless ambitions. For Trump, it offers a twofold win: economic benefits for US firms and a geopolitical wedge against China’s growing tech presence in the Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this shift has not come without criticism. Some US lawmakers have expressed concern that the export of frontier AI capabilities to Gulf states risks undermining long-term American technological advantage, and could open the door to indirect Chinese access, particularly given UAE’s historically ambivalent alignment and G42’s past ties with Chinese entities. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has dismissed such fears as “naïve”, arguing that the benefits of closer alignment with trusted Gulf partners outweigh the risks. But the tension between commercial expansion and national security remains unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-middle-east-as-an-ai-battleground&quot;&gt;The Middle East as an AI Battleground&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Gulf nations, AI has become a core strategic priority. As the energy transition accelerates, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar see AI as a foundational pillar of their post-oil economies. But beyond diversification lies ambition, to become global AI hubs that can shape future norms, control regional data ecosystems, and project soft power through technological leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trumps’ visit validated those ambitions. The deals inked were not just about chip sales, they included infrastructure, cloud sovereignty, and data centre construction. In effect, the US is helping Gulf allies build end-to-end AI ecosystems that could rival Western digital economies in scale and sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of these efforts is a drive toward AI sovereignty, the ability of states to control their own compute power, training data and cloud infrastructure without reliance on foreign platforms. For the Gulf states, this is not only a matter of economic futureproofing but also of strategic autonomy. Building massive domestic data centres, securing dedicated chip pipelines, and localising cloud operations are steps toward reducing dependence on external providers and shaping their own digital destinies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This emerging Middle Easter tech bloc, however, is not emerging in isolation. China has invested heavily in Gulf digital infrastructure, including Huawei’s cloud services, smart city initiatives, and surveillance technologies. Trump’s AI diplomacy aims to displace that influence, but the contest is far from over. In many Gulf capitals, the preference remains for balancing, not choosing, between Washington and Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;risks-of-a-fragmented-digital-order&quot;&gt;Risks of a Fragmented Digital Order&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geopolitical consequences of this AI arms race are profound. The first is the growing fragmentation of the global digital order. Rather than a cohesive rules-based system for emerging technologies, the world is increasingly defined by bilateral tech pacts, regional standards, and selective access to innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s Middles East tour reinforced this trend. His administration’s approach to AI governance is unilateral and transactional, favouring deals over diplomacy and power over principles. The implication is that access to American technology no longer depends on shared values or regulatory alignment, but on strategic loyalty, and, often, the ability to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second consequence is the diffusion of dual-use technologies without robust oversight. Blackwell chips and massive data centres are not neutral tools, they are accelerants of surveillance, military AI development, and influence operations should their owners choose to direct them to do so. In the absence of international guardrails, their unchecked proliferation could fuel authoritarian entrenchment and regional instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this strategy could undercut the very alliances it seeks to strengthen. European and Indo-Pacific allies, many of whom were pressured under Biden to adopt restrictive AI governance frameworks and align with US-led semiconductor controls, may bristle at what looks like a double standard. Why are Washington’s Gulf partners receiving the world’s most advanced AI tools with minimal conditions, while other face scrutiny and constraint?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-a-new-tech-grand-strategy&quot;&gt;Toward a New Tech Grand Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deeper question raised by Trump’s Middle East AI offensive is whether the US has a coherent grand strategy for technology. The postwar American order was built on more than just dominance, it was rooted in norms, institutions and alliances. In the AI age, those foundations are eroding. In their place, the Trump administration appears to be constructing a world of high-tech spheres of influence, in which economic opportunity trumps normative convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is the new reality, then allies and adversaries alike will adapt accordingly. China, having watched Washington’s AI diplomacy unfold in the Gulf, is unlikely to sit idle. It is already offering open-weight AI models to partners seeking alternatives to US restrictions and could double-down on providing infrastructure-as-a-service via Huawei Cloud and other digital silk road assets. Beijing may seek to undercut American firms in regions where cost and political alignment make it an attractive alternative, particularly in parts of Africa, Central Asia and Southeast Asia. The US may have secured a tactical lead in the Gulf, but the strategic competition with China over global AI alignment remains wide open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe may seek to chart a more independent digital path, wary of both American tech exceptionalism and Chinese surveillance exports. The Global South will continue to navigate a fragmented landscape, forced to make choices between competing standards, platforms and providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Gulf, the coming years will bring both opportunity and scrutiny. Their partnership with Washington on AI may accelerate economic transformation and geopolitical relevance, but it will also invite deeper debates over surveillance, data control and the militarisation of AI. Whether they emerge as responsible stewards of this new digital power, or as flashpoints in a wider tech conflict, will depend as much on domestic governance as on external alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What also stands out from the Middle East tour is how central US tech firms have become to the execution of foreign policy. Companies like Nvidia, AMD, and AWS were not peripheral to these agreements, they were main instruments. Their infrastructure, chips, and cloud services are now tools of statecraft, blurring the lines between commercial enterprise and geopolitical actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was not just corporations in the room. High-profile tech leaders and billionaires, including OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Tesla and Space X’s Elon Musk and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, all joined Trump on tour, reflecting a broader shift in who wields influence over international technology strategy. These individuals, through their platforms, capital, and personal networks, are increasingly operating as de facto diplomats, brokering access, shaping narratives, and influencing which nations get fast-tracked into the AI-powered future. As national security priorities become increasingly entangled with private-sector capabilities and personalities, the strategic influence of these actors, and the degree of transparency and oversight they are subject to, will be a critical issue in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week marked a significant evolution in how technological influence is being wielded in global affairs. By supporting the rapid expansion of AI capabilities in Gulf states, Washington is both accelerating regional ambitions and reshaping the geopolitical contours of advanced technology. These deals reflect a growing recognition that access to cutting-edge infrastructure, chips, data centres, cloud capacity, is becoming a central axis of strategic alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this approach also brings complexity. The diffusion of high-end AI tools into politically diverse and strategically independent environments raises important questions about long-term interoperability, trust and governance. Managing the balance between commercial opportunity, strategic influence, and technological safeguards will be a persistent challenge, not just for the US, but for its partners as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the global race for AI leadership intensifies, what unfolds in the Gulf may prove a bellwether for the broader digital order, a test case for how major powers engage in technology statecraft in an increasingly multipolar and often fragmented world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is safe to say this is a challenging time for the NATO Alliance and Euro-Atlantic Security. In this changing world, when the UK is taking a leading role in Europe’s adaptation to the new security paradigm, there is a requirement for demonstrable action and leadership today. The delivery of a fully-enabled corps is one of the British Army’s essential contributions to UK Defence. How the corps will fight is the subject of this RUSI study day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-corps&quot;&gt;What is a Corps?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the tactical, operational and strategic framework the modern corps sits on the seam between the higher tactical and operational levels of NATO’s warfighting architecture. While still very much focussed on the battle, the corps looks much wider than the division and has a very different role. Divisions focus on enabling the close battle, allowing their subordinate brigades to fight and win against our adversaries. The corps fights the deep battle, striking key enemy command and control, long range fires, electronic warfare, air defence and logistics capabilities, thereby shaping the environment and setting the conditions for the divisions and brigades in their close fights to come. The advent of new technologies, driven in part by the war in Ukraine, are offering new capabilities that increase the range of the corps deep battle to 300km and beyond. The corps also protects the force, an increasingly difficult proposition in modern times, ensuring forward echelons can survive to fight, supply lines remain intact and that troops can rest and rehabilitate before being redeployed. In the close battle the corps synchronises the divisions providing protection and support from corps level capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our recent focus on counter insurgency operations means the corps level of warfighting is not well understood. I believe it has three key characteristics: scale, complexity and endurance. In terms of scale, a corps commander can expect to command at a minimum, two divisions and a range of key capabilities, between 50,000–150,000 people and their equipment, with a requirement to synchronise effects across all of the domains in support of the divisional fight. In terms of geographic scale, planning distances mean that the corps area of operations is approximately 100km wide by 200km deep, with the corps deep extending another 300km beyond that. Or to put it another way, an area roughly the size of Wales. Complexity exists everywhere: from protecting the force against increasingly sophisticated threats; the logistics designed to keep a large force supplied with food, ammunition, fuel and medical support; and managing the thousands of data points produced every minute, all while contending with whatever the enemy decides to throw at it. The corps also endures in a way that no other formation can. A division can rotate in and out of the fight, but a corps remains throughout; managing complex logistical trails, supporting the host nation and providing a consistent command and point of presence until the task at hand is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-the-21st-century-corps-fights&quot;&gt;How the 21st Century Corps fights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote a former French Prime Minister “Generals always prepare to fight the last war, especially if they had won it”. Our insights from Ukraine provide an indication of what the next war may look like. To ensure we are ready to fight and win there are a number of key areas where we are focusing, to improve how the corps fights in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start where we normally finish. For most of my career, logistics has been the last thing that is covered in any planning meeting or orders session. It is now my first point of call and for good reason. We all must understand the scale of logistics required for the UK’s corps to be credible in delivering deterrence. For the ARRC to arrive in the right place, at the right combat effectiveness, ready to fight and win – the challenge is vast. But that is the tip of the sustainment iceberg; we then must sustain the force over protracted and contested lines of communication. The complexities involved in deploying a multinational force across oceans and multiple international borders are significant; while we are working closely with NATO and national formations, it would likely be a national undertaking of a scale not seen since the Gulf War. Our ability to sustain the fight would require a whole-of-society and industry approach, one now capably being led by the National Armaments Director to give us the magazine depth and production capacity to match that of our adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our adversaries have a sophisticated and effective system of layered defence, both in the physical and electromagnetic spectrums on the Land and in the Air. We must learn from this and change our view of how we deliver protection and how we manage risk. Protection cannot be something we consider for defending our critical assets. Instead, it must become integral to everything we do – it is a building block of modern corps warfighting. At the most simplistic level the bubble of protection creates freedom of manoeuvre in the corps’ rear and close which enables timely effects to be delivered in the corps’ deep. In future battles the corps with the most extensive and lethal bubble will wrestle a significant advantage, and those corps that are able to move and synchronise their bubbles with multi-domain effects will be able to dominate the battlefield. To prosecute the corps battle we have traditionally fired to manoeuvre – suppressed the enemy then moved. But without the protection from layered defences both physically and in the electro-magnetic spectrum any attempts to fire into the enemy’s deep are likely to attract the wrath of the enemy’s recce-strike complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With logistics and layered protection in place, my next priority is to strike the enemy at distance, creating the unfair fight for the divisions. The proliferation of uncrewed systems has changed the character of conflict and how we fight in the deep. There is still a vital role in modern warfare for our survivable systems, the tank, the attack helicopter and the artillery piece. But as Ukraine has showed, we can be smarter with how we develop and integrate these with less-expensive attritable and consumable systems. CGS has set the target that in the future 40% of the Army’s lethality will come from the attritable, 40% from consumable and 20% from the survivable. With this in mind we are ideally positioned to ensure that we are preparing to fight the next war, not the last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a period of our history where demonstrable action and leadership is required today our reinvestment in the UK’s corps has started. There is much work still to do and I hope the focused study day at RUSI will provide much of the impetus we require.&lt;/p&gt;

While existing scholarship on bug bounty reveals how these platforms structure hackers’ labor, we look symmetrically and ask: How do bug bounty platforms shape the work of program managers on the clients’ side? We use data from 13 semi-structured interviews with bug bounty managers and concepts from platform studies and computer-supported cooperative work. Our study reveals, first, that managing a program requires four types of articulation work: (1) to attract quality hackers, (2) to manage the high number of reports (3) to find the internal asset owner, and (4) to negotiate the disclosure schedule with hackers. Second, managers consider this additional labor positively, despite some adversarial behaviors from hackers. This study makes a case to study how platforms shape labor on both the supply and the demand sides and calls for further analyses of platform labor using the concept of articulation work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical scholarship has long revealed the fallacy of platform companies’ position as a “neutral intermediary” between two or more parties. The pioneering work of Tarleton Gillespie showed instead how this stance acted as a rhetorical device to entice the various parties to join the platform, while serving the interest of the platform owners. Ample scholarship has since revealed the many interventions of platforms across sectors e.g., by actively curating online content, creating new forms of dependencies within several cultural industries, and acting as de facto employers in many industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scholarship uncovers the agency of digital platforms by focusing on their constraints on people and industries; conversely, it shows how platform users resist, mitigate or subvert these constraints. However, equally important is the power that platform companies derive from their absence of constraints: Huber and Pierce characterize platforms as a structured but intentionally flexible framework which they call “an empty shell”. In their study, they show how such a loose structure can be as powerful as rigid rules to shape the activity of platform users: the health workers they analyze develop various forms of articulation work to compensate for the absence of clear rules from platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We apply the concept of the “empty shell” to platforms and similarly reveal the articulation work they generate. We specifically look at bug bounty platforms i.e., companies selling bug bounty programs (henceforth, “vendors”). In such programs, independent security researchers (or “hackers”) report security vulnerabilities (or “bugs”) to organizations for a reward (or “bounty”). While bug disclosure has a much longer history, it is increasingly organized by a few large vendors (such as HackerOne or Bugcrowd) that apply the platform model to cybersecurity, putting into contact independent cybersecurity researchers with clients, and monetizing this intermediary position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Existing research on bug bounty platforms focuses on the vendors’ constraints on the work of hackers: they shape their labor conditions and effectively turn them into “gig workers”. We complement this scholarship by focusing, first, on the other side of the platform, i.e., not the labor supply side (the hackers), but the currently under-researched labor demand side (the client of the program). We focus specifically on the employees of the clients managing the bug bounty program (henceforth, the “manager”). Second, following Huber and Pierce, we reveal how these workers react to and perceive the absence of platform’s constraints: looking at bug bounty platforms as an “empty shell” reveals the plurality of articulation work that managers provide to ensure their program is successful. We describe in the remainder of the introduction how we engage with scholarship on bug bounty, how we leverage the theoretical framework on articulation work, our research question, and our methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;literature-review-and-theoretical-framework&quot;&gt;Literature review and theoretical framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bug-bounty-as-a-platform&quot;&gt;Bug bounty “as a platform”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large vendors of bug bounty programs, such as Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the United States, and YesWeHack and Intigriti in Europe, all emerged during the 2010s. The history of bug bounty has already shown how this vendor-driven model emerged following a decades-long shift of the professional and legal statuses of cybersecurity researchers. A few organizations experimented with this form of vulnerability reporting throughout the 1990s and 2000s (such as Netscape and Mozilla), before Meta and Google put bug bounty into the spotlight in the early 2010s by releasing their highly-publicized programs. Throughout the 2010s, the model reached the mainstream when Etsy, GitHub, and Microsoft also launched their own programs. Bug bounty gained respectability in 2016 with the U.S. Department of Defense’s widely reported “Hack the Pentagon” event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large bug bounty vendors apply the platform model to bounty hunting by monetizing their brokering function between the two parties. In this context, scholars have extensively revealed the detrimental implications this model has on hackers’ labor. Large vendors have effectively commodified vulnerabilities by taking control over the disclosure schedule and reward. Moreover, they have created a bug market that is highly stratified and power-law distributed, with few researchers reporting frequently and for a high reward, while the vast majority report little and for little to no compensation. As a result of this market structure, “skilled bug bounty hunters rarely make a good living by Western standards”. In other words, bug bounty vendors transform security researchers into “gig workers,” a form of labor characterized by casualization, informalization, and precarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars of bug bounty have so far overwhelmingly focused on the labor supply side, that is, on hackers. What is still missing is an equally rich analysis of how the platform model shapes the work of the client to manage their program. Moreover, the existing focus is on the multiple constraints that such platforms create. Following Huber and Pierce, we show that the absence of constraints in bug bounty platforms is equally important to shaping how program managers work, which we analyze here using the concept of articulation work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;articulation-work-and-computer-supported-cooperative-work&quot;&gt;Articulation work and computer-supported cooperative work&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Articulation work originates from the sociological analysis of professional practices and work situations, and is central to the field of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW). The concept reveals the plurality of forms of work, the involvement of workers, and the various levels of visibility attached to different forms of work. Strauss first defined it as the work that is involved in organizing both tasks and the relationship between workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength of the concept is to link the general goal of a project and the many tasks required to complete it. Strauss names the former the “arc of work” i.e., the complete set of tasks organized both in sequence and in parallel throughout the trajectory of a project. In this view, completing such a project requires the integration of “tasks, clusters of tasks, and segments of the total arc”. The person ensuring that all the sub-projects eventually align toward the completion of the project is said to provide articulation work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequent scholarship has extended the concept by emphasizing the plurality of elements constituting articulation work. Lucy Suchman mentioned the ongoing effort to integrate fragmented elements – such as organizations, professional practices, and technologies – into working configurations. Similarly, she mentioned that articulation work requires “diverse discursive and material, human and artifactual elements” that must be integrated to build “stable organizations and artifacts”. The articulation workers align all these elements toward a coherent end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is a paucity of scholarship in platform studies using the concept, the work of Huber and Pierce is enlightening as it reveals the forms of articulation work that a platform architecture generates. For them, the looser the rules of a platform, the more articulation work it requires from workers to conduct their activity, e.g., a health practitioner must compensate for the missing “professional norms, regulations, and managerial expectations” on teletherapy platforms. In this article, we similarly apply the concept of articulation work to bug bounty platforms, and ask: How do bug bounty platforms shape the work of managers at the client’s side?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conducted 13 semi-structured interviews with employees in charge of managing the bug bounty program at their current or past company. Twelve respondents worked at private companies and one at a non-profit organization. All respondents except one had contracted with one of the four major bug bounty vendors (Bugcrowd, HackerOne, YesWeHack, and Intigriti). Most respondents contracted with one vendor only, and one contracted with two vendors. Our respondents either managed public or private programs, or a mix of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we use the generic terms of “program manager” or just “manager” in this article, our respondents identified with several different titles. Some managers worked full time on managing the bug bounty program, while others did it along other responsibilities. They worked at companies located in Europe, North America, Australasia, and South America. This coverage is limited but is representative of the global geography of the bug bounty market, with the major vendors exclusively headquartered in the Global North and with only a limited customer base in the Global South. Despite our efforts to recruit non-male respondents, we ended up with only two female respondents, echoing the strong male dominance in the cybersecurity sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recruited respondents in three phases. First, we relied on personal connections in the field to recruit two respondents to pilot the question guide. After revising the question guide, a call for respondents was published in a private bug bounty forum, and several other managers volunteered to be part of the study. We extended the pool by looking up authors of customers’ testimonies published on vendors’ websites and invited them to participate in the study via LinkedIn messages. Finally, we contacted additional program managers on LinkedIn that we found using variations of the query “bug bounty program managers.” We stopped the interview recruitment upon reaching data saturation after 13 interviews of managers working at 10 different companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conducted all the interviews via Zoom between March 2022 and March 2023 after piloting the question guide twice. We designed our topic guide around key themes based on the existing literature, our past research on the topic, and our research objectives for this article. The 13 interviews were with one respondent each and lasted between 35:38 and 71:48 min. Respondents were not compensated. Interviews were conducted in English or French. Prior to the interview, we sent an information sheet and consent form via email, and we collected their signed consent. Two respondents requested oral consent, which was recorded prior to starting the interview. One respondent requested the interview not to be recorded but agreed to have the interview notes used in the analysis. Audio files were transcribed via a paid service, and all transcripts were anonymized. We then conducted a thematic analysis of the transcripts by proceeding both deductively (by coding for themes that we had already identified in the literature and our past research) and inductively (by coding for new themes that emerged from the transcripts). This thematic analysis took the form of a codebook that one of us created in NVivo and that contained the deductive and inductive codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;findings&quot;&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reveal the articulation work of managers, we first need to define the services that platform vendors provide to their clients, ordered here chronologically. Before the program starts, they advise clients on how to design and manage their program e.g., whether they want a public or private program. Other key parameters are the types of vulnerabilities clients will accept (the “scope”) and the type and level of rewards. To start the program, vendors leverage their database of independent researchers to connect them to clients and their programs. While the vendors’ outreach to hackers is very minimal in a public program, they directly invite researchers to specific private programs. Particularly appreciated by our respondents are background checks (basic identity check, presence on lists of sanctions, etc.) and payments (especially dealing with different tax systems and foreign currencies, etc.). Optionally, the vendors can also review the hacker’s submissions before passing the relevant ones to the clients (“triage”). This list reveals that platform vendors take care of the logistics of a program (program design, inviting researchers, payment and triage, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, all the work necessary to animate the program – i.e., getting actionable reports of relevant vulnerabilities – is the responsibility of the program managers. Our study reveals, first, that this labor is complex and multifaceted; specifically, it requires four types of articulation work, which we describe in the first result section:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To obtain valid reports from researchers, managers must attract quality hackers and convince them to participate in the program;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They must manage the high number of low-quality submissions (the “noise”), usually by using the triage function of the vendor;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to remediating the vulnerability, the manager must identify the owner of the compromised asset, and convince them to fix it;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The public disclosure of the bug usually requires a negotiation around the timing with the hacker.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1. Articulation between main and sub-tasks in the bug bounty pipeline.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these tasks constitute a sub-project, and it is the manager’s role to align them with the arc of the project. We describe what each of these four types of articulation work entails and what is at stake. In the second result section, we show that while this articulation work is additional labor for managers, they consider it a positive aspect of their work. Managers mostly enjoy the opportunity to interact with hackers, even though this can involve some adversarial behaviors. Managers are mostly satisfied with the “empty shell” that platform vendors provide and are not looking for the vendors to impose more constraints or to weigh in their relationship with hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four-types-of-articulation-work&quot;&gt;Four types of articulation work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-and-retaining-quality-hackers&quot;&gt;Finding and retaining quality hackers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not hard for the managers we interviewed to obtain bugs reports via their programs, but it was harder to obtain relevant ones. Several of them designated the high volume of irrelevant bug reports as “noise.” Bug reports are classified as noise if they are outside the scope of accepted bugs, if they are duplicate, or just a report from automated scanning tools. Respondent 9 described this noise as “the worst problem for [them].” Managers attribute this noise to the high number of low-qualified hackers, as eloquently put by R12: “On the platform, you have many script kiddies that are just launching a vulnerability scan and providing a report.” Moreover, programs compete to attract the best hackers: “If you are a big beefy company,” as R3 says, “there will be people lining up at the door to get into your program.” Smaller companies, however, will have a harder time finding quality researchers for their programs. A first difficulty for managers is therefore to find competent hackers to join their programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While triage (described in point 2 “Managing noise via triage” below) allows managers to deal with the noise quantitatively, equally crucial is how managers deal qualitatively and preemptively with this issue. They create and maintain a network of hackers to attract the best ones to their program. To start with, program managers multiply venues for recruitment. They use their own channels and don’t rely solely on the pool of researchers that the vendors provide, for example in a private program. They use various social media as channels to recruit, such as WhatsApp or Signal groups, X, or bug bounty forum Slack channels – all of which are key “to create awareness about [their] programs,” according to R13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding quality hackers sometimes requires clients to train them. For example, R7’s team visits universities “to find that next generation of talent.” They also give students “books and media posts and all the bug bounty community research” to get them started with bug hunting. Simply spreading the word might not be enough for some specific products that are complex to understand and therefore to test. Some managers like R6 must literally “train [researchers] to speed up the preconditions to start to report vulnerabilities” by providing “technical deep dives on design work and the componentry involved in software design,” while being aware that such preliminary and additional work might be a deterrent for some researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After scouting quality hackers, managers must keep them engaged with their program. Program managers with both public and private programs can shift researchers from one pool to the next as a reward: “If we see a hacker from the public program […] being really active and sending us valuable reports, we immediately invite him in private, as a sign of appreciation” (R11). Private programs are invite-only and rewards are typically better. Managers can also contact researchers with whom they have already worked in past programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key factor to increasing engagement is the reward. While the reward structure is defined up front and communicated to the researcher via a severity scale, managers can be flexible to keep the researcher participating in the program. For example, since a frequent difficulty for triagers and managers is to understand the report (typically requiring a back-and-forth between them and the researcher), some managers will offer an additional reward for a high-quality report providing clear steps for quick replicability. Similarly, some will pay for out-of-scope bugs if they are of strong interest to the security team. Others like R6 can add a monetary bonus “just to reward the effort,” e.g., a detailed report, even for a duplicate vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-monetary rewards are another common way for managers to keep researchers engaged. Since there is strong competition between programs, managers like R5 need to innovate beyond financial rewards “to make [researchers] feel that they’re part of a big thing that’s happening.” Swag (e.g., a piece of clothing with the name of the client’s company) is an important tool for reputation building, especially at public events. To some extent, they are more valued by researchers than monetary rewards, as R6 ponders: “Swag is one of the recognitions that we do, and I find that extremely useful. It’s really interesting to me that if you send someone a $50 gift card, or you send them a $20 hoodie, they’ll like the hoodie more than the gift card.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;managing-the-noise-via-triage&quot;&gt;Managing the “noise” via triage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common way of dealing with the high volume of reports is to hire the service of a triage team. Vendors provide access to such a team as an additional paid service. Triagers are the first to receive the report and, crucially, they assess the severity level of the reported bug which corresponds to a reward structure (typically, the higher the severity, the higher the reward).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since clients outsource this service to the vendor, one could assume that their relations with triagers are straightforward. Managers, however, must constantly monitor triagers’ work. First, since the triage team is the first point of contact with the researchers’ community, they are the “front” of the company, and some managers want the triagers to positively represent their company in the hackers’ community. R4 mentioned how they had to “teach” the vendors’ triage team to treat researchers more respectfully. A researcher who has experienced a poor triage experience will not be inclined to look for more bugs for this company. Some clients have exposed complex products to hackers, requiring their team to train triagers to understand the product and better identify relevant bugs. Finally, the specific needs that the clients have must be also clearly and constantly communicated to the triagers’ team to customize their treatment of bugs – for example, to receive any “customer questions and complaints” as well as bugs – usually after “a long process training” of the triage team for R4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-the-internal-owner-of-the-compromised-asset&quot;&gt;Finding the internal owner of the compromised asset&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the bug has passed through triage and has been identified as a valid report, fixing it requires the manager to create another sub-project: they must coordinate with the internal owner of the product affected by the bug, who must fix it. In small companies, the security team might handle both the program and the remediation of the bug, but there is frequently a division of labor between the security team and the developer/production team. The former allocates the report and monitors its remediation, while the latter fixes the vulnerability. Once again, this process is not always straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon reception, some product owners might deny the severity of the report altogether. R12 recollects how they once reported to a staff member an internal document that was not protected (hence accessible by uncredentialed staff). The answer they received was that it did not matter, since “people don’t have the link” – leading the manager to reflect that “sometimes, internal communication is more complex than communication with a researcher.” Others will try to dodge the responsibility to fix the bug, as R3 reports: “If you’re a software engineer and the bug is assigned to you, you’ll be like: ‘No, no, no, no, that’s not me. But I know who that person is!’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product owners might also feel accused of doing their job wrong, which is a feeling the program managers have to defuse: “It’s a very awkward conversation,” recollects R2. Vulnerability is usually not designed on purpose. “Nobody wakes up one day and says, I’m going to write terrible code,” as R3 put it, and more plausible causes are that “they might not know how to write secure code, or they might be in a hot rush because some product manager might be pushing them.” R2 reveals that some product owners develop a strong emotional attachment to their product, which will result in pushback after the manager has “just told them they have an ugly baby” i.e., that their product is faulty:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They can spend an entire career on one set of products. They’re very attached to that. […] Then you have somebody from the outside who comes in and says: “Oh, by the way, your product is all messed up and how dare you put this product out there in the wild.” So, there is a natural conflict that happens there. (R2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the negotiation between the manager and the product owner to accept the bug, managers must monitor their progress in fixing it. The product team might reluctantly respond to such a request, as R3 put it: “Sometimes they ignore it. Sometimes they don’t look at it. Sometimes they don’t have time.” Managers use Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and their specific timelines to pressure the development team by “holding any SLAs over their head, making sure that they’re moving forward.” This can also be escalated to increase pressure on the internal team, as R3 sometimes does: “Break it to the board. Here’s the risk that is coming from older bugs that are not being fixed. Create pressure from the top and create responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies spend a considerable amount of resources to inform and train their staff to fix bugs early and quickly, as R7 recollects: “They do now understand what we are talking about, they do understand the SLA and that they need to fix that.” Other companies have been less successful. The best R1 could get was a compromise over a 90-day response: “Even that had to be a bit of a battle with our developers internally. Seriously? […] 90 days is a long time.” The team has since agreed to “shorten it down but even then, once in a while, a vulnerability stretches a bit beyond for whatever reason” – an “unfortunate” result according to the manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;negotiating-the-disclosure-schedule&quot;&gt;Negotiating the disclosure schedule&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After fixing the bug, there can still be tensions around the timing of the disclosure of the bug. Researchers are usually independent workers in a reputation-based market: they want to quickly promote their skills to the community by describing how they found a specific bug (online or at key industry events). This desire to publicize their finding clashes with the desire of companies to keep control over the communication and timing of public disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies try to work out a timeline with researchers to make sure they have time to fix the bug internally, then issue a patch to their clients and leave them time to implement it, before they (or the researcher) publicly disclose the bug, as R2 put it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we disclose to the public, we’re actually zero-dating our own customers, which is not a good thing to do. We give them pre-notice and say, okay, this is going to come out in 90 days, here is our suggested security implementation […] They then will do whatever work they need to. If they need to hold for whatever reason then we’ll go back to the security researcher and say, this is what’s going on, we’re going to be delayed for two weeks. At that point, once the 90 days are up, we disclose the vulnerability publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managers mention hackers frequently using such a threat of disclosing: R4 recollects that “many times we receive a submission that starts with: ‘I intend to disclose this within 90 days, here’s the issue.’” Hackers might have experienced past poor treatment from a client or the vendor’s triager and might be keen on getting their attention via a preliminary show of force. It can also be a way of guaranteeing a speedy treatment of their report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, the disclosure of a bug usually happens via negotiation between the client and the hacker. Program managers have experience and procedures to deal with such a threat and will usually engage with researchers to control the narrative around the bug. R4 mentions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If they are going to disclose, we have playbooks for responsible disclosure where we ask them: “Hey, can you share the blog with us? Can we have a say in the blog? Can we change this? Can you work with us here?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;managers-perception-of-articulation-work&quot;&gt;Managers’ perception of articulation work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholarship on platform labor tends to emphasize how labor management via platforms generates hardship for workers. Adopting a symmetrical point of view and looking at the managers of the programs, we look here at their perception of how the platform shapes their work. Managers appreciate the fact that the minimal involvement of the platform allows them to interact directly with the hacker’s community which is, for many, an important reason to have a bug bounty program. They acknowledge, nonetheless, that the model generates adversarial interactions with hackers due to competing interests and timing. They do not, however, want more involvement from the platform, except in rare cases where mediation is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many managers, attending events, hosting receptions, talking to highly skilled hackers, and learning about new techniques are all aspects of bounty hunting that they value. R11 remembers the positive outcome of attending a hacker’s event: “it was awesome, to meet the hackers in person, to have a chat with them, see the real person behind the username, shake hands, have some fun together, and collaborate during the live hacking event.” R6 mentions the importance of “putting names to faces” via informal meetups at conferences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;we’re going to a conference, let’s take everyone out to dinner or happy hour or something to put names to faces. And [to] recognize people as humans rather than just a name on the other side of the screen somewhere around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others like R7 have deeply integrated the organization of hacking event as part of their bug bounty management:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From two years ago to now, we spent a lot of money going to different countries and organizing hacking events. And getting there with them to try to help them to their vulnerability or try to answer their questions in a close way. That’s very important to be close with them. Not just in terms of playing, but in terms of people skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managers acknowledge, however, that not all interactions with hackers go well. The platform brings together two actors with opposed goals: hackers want money and timely processing for their reports, and managers must enforce a scope of accepted bugs, a reward scale, and a timeline for remediation. These two interests can clash. As R2 put it: “Sometimes hackers behave badly. We had an instance where somebody […] was unhappy with the results of their submission, and they started basically harassing and stalking [the employee].” In such cases, the vendor can act as a mediator in the conflict. This is important to managers such as R2 to “make sure that there’s a code of conduct, make sure that there’s an escalation policy.” The effect is usually positive: “Sometimes having that objective third party is enough to calm the situation down.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One step further, dealing with hackers can have strong implications on managers’ mental health. As R2 carries on: “There is a high burnout rate because everyone’s mad at you all the time no matter what you do.” Their company has implemented a surprising measure against this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There’s a company out there called [ – ] and they do conflict resolution training. It’s funny because the person who created it was an FBI hostage negotiator. All of our team goes through that training. And it’s basically to help you figure out how you do not internalize when people are yelling at you all day long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This minimal engagement of vendors, leaving the managers the work to animate the program, directly echoes the model of platform as an empty shell. However, despite the tensions this model can generate, managers do not ask for greater platform involvement. As R5 put it, the direct link to the researchers is the lasting bond they want to create, and it is stronger without the mediation of the platform:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think for our organization, we want to have that direct line with the researchers. We want our brand to be associated to it, not necessarily the vendor […] Because vendor relationships change. And we want that loyalty towards us, not other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While managers acknowledge the difficulties with several actors and tasks, they do not want the vendor to be more present in their relationship with hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-future-research&quot;&gt;Conclusion and future research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if the user of a ride-sharing application, to obtain their ride, had to first get in touch with the drivers’ community, convince them to come to their location, and proactively maintain good rapport to keep getting rides? While this sounds unconceivable in many sectors, it is exactly the work bug bounty vendors ask their clients to perform to get hackers reporting bugs to their programs. While our sample of respondents is relatively small, our analysis of the manager’s side of a such programs complements existing scholarship on bug bounty, which overwhelmingly focuses on hackers. Drawing upon the concept of platforms as an “empty shell”, we reveal that managers must engage in four types of articulation work to make their program a success. Each of the important stages of a typical bug bounty pipeline (1. obtaining bug reports, 2. reviewing the report, 3. fixing the bug, and 4. disclosing it) generates four sub-projects that are necessary for the success of the program (respectively, to 1. to attract quality hackers, 2. to manage the noise, 3. to find the asset owner, and 4. to negotiate the disclosure schedule with hackers), cf. Figure 1. Managers coordinate all these sub-projects and align them toward the arc of the project. Furthermore, while this study included respondents with a public and / or a private program, further research uncovering the reasons why managers choose one versus the other (or both), and what effects this choice has on the articulation work with the other actors involved, could extend the results from this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specific case of bug bounty platform enriches the analysis of digital platforms by highlighting a set of new tensions, summarized in Table 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9t3LV2R.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1. Summary of current and future research.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the article shows that focusing only on the labor side (in this case, the hackers) misses half of the consequences this model has on platform work, and it makes a case to symmetrically look at consequences on the demand side. Second, it expands existing calls for the analysis of how the platform model shapes labor via the absence of constraints, which is as powerful as its constraints to shape labor. Third, while resistance to platforms’ constraints can be important and generative, some actors endorse the “empty shell” that the platform provides. Fourth, while platform scholars aim to design a governance model adapted to the agency of platforms, some actors are satisfied with the minimal involvement of platform owners. Finally, the concept of articulation work and CSCW writ large are useful perspectives to critically study the consequences of the platform model on labor, and we hope more research will adopt this interdisciplinary perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

Europe needs a new doctrine that places cyberspace at the heart of strategic planning, bridging civil and military domains for national resilience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent shift in US strategic posture towards Europe and trade is beginning to reveal significant implications, particularly in cyberspace and the role of the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe must not only equip itself with a defence strategy that substantially boosts investment and enhances its own autonomous capabilities, but it must also reframe how it integrates the cyber domain within its broader defence architecture. This article outlines how Europe needs a new doctrine for defence in cyberspace and makes three key proposals to accelerate and consolidate civil-military cyber convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While cyberspace has been formally recognised as the fourth operational domain – alongside land, sea, and air – this designation has yet to translate into making it a central pillar of defence strategy. Being recognised as a domain is not the same as being treated as central in strategic planning and operational doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberspace is not only a theatre of operations in its own right; it is a critical enabler that underpins and intersects with all other domains. What remains lacking is the “how” – the frameworks, doctrines, and institutional mechanisms needed to embed cyber at the heart of defence planning and execution, also covering the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional defence doctrine is not readily applicable to cyberspace, due to the fundamentally different nature of the domain. Unlike kinetic environments, cyberspace does not conform to the laws of physical space, and it is shaped by a vastly different set of actors and dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private sector plays a decisive role – not only as a provider of technology, but as the operator of essential national services. This dual dependence on infrastructure and private operators demands a radically new approach to integration, coordination, and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional defence doctrine falls short in cyberspace, necessitating the transformation of National Cyber Coordination Centres into real-time operational hubs that integrate civilian, military, and critical infrastructure actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-limits-of-traditional-approaches&quot;&gt;The Limits of Traditional Approaches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is precisely this complexity that demands new frameworks and doctrines. Rather than treating it as an afterthought, the cyber domain must become a central pillar of Europe’s evolving defence architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional battlefields, cyberspace operates as a single, interconnected domain where technological architecture serves multiple purposes simultaneously. A server that hosts military communications could be technically indistinguishable from one supporting critical financial infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, traditional military strategies, designed for physical spaces governed by kinetic force, fall short in the cyber domain. A bullet, for instance, is universally recognised across contexts as a weapon. In contrast, a string of digital code has no inherent meaning until it is interpreted within a specific technological and operational framework – one that can vary dramatically depending on the context, the technology in question, and the identity of the operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes cyber defence much more complex and creates a strong link between the infrastructure and its cyber threat detection and attribution, significantly increasing complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the limits of traditional approaches, an Extended Permanent Cyber Defence Force composed of cybersecurity professionals embedded in their civilian roles should be established to optimise national resources and ensure scalable and rapid national cyber defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-fragmented-system-gaps-in-governance-and-risk-management&quot;&gt;A Fragmented System: Gaps in Governance and Risk Management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most cyberspace operators and assets are privately owned. Consequently, private enterprises are both the primary targets of cyberattacks and frontline defenders against these threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National cybersecurity agencies have developed regulatory frameworks aimed at fortifying critical infrastructure protections. However, while the private sector should not only comply with regulations but also proactively collaborate with governmental and military institutions to enhance collective defence mechanisms, this is currently missing from many cyber defence approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protection of critical infrastructures is almost everywhere the responsibility of civilian agencies, with little or no coordination with the defence side. While many countries have identified a connection between defence and national cyber authorities, these are often in the form of committees that are involved in case of conflicts or major incidents, as for example the model adopted by US with Presidential Policy Directive 42 of 2016, that creates a patchwork of overlapping authorities without a clear operational model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has been one of the first countries to promote an Integrated Operating Concept, which has been followed by a new version of the National Cyber Strategy, that established the National Cyber Force (NCF), a joint unit between the MoD and GCHQ (intelligence), but only to conduct offensive cyber operations. The integrated operating model is providing ambitious objectives around multidomain integration and developing an integration model that is different from operating and warfighting – something essential for cyber as resilience can only be built overtime in preparation for warfighting. But even these examples show we are still missing the definition of an operational doctrine to develop and fully implement the high-level objectives given by the strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the often-overlooked web of interdependencies between infrastructures, the challenge is not just about protecting isolated systems but understanding how failures in one domain can cascade through interconnected systems. These connections form an intricate network where vulnerabilities in one sector can have profound ripple effects across others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An even subtler form of dependency arises from shared technologies. Independent operators may unknowingly rely on the same technological components, such as widely used software or hardware platforms. A cyberattack exploiting a vulnerability in this shared technology could simultaneously compromise a vast array of seemingly unrelated infrastructures. A particularly telling example is the deployment of identical solar panel controllers across numerous independently managed facilities. In 2024 a targeted attack against this common technological point already disrupted energy generation on a relevant scale, effectively turning what appears to be a decentralised system into a single “virtual critical infrastructure” with national-level consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many countries have established strong regulatory foundations and dedicated cybersecurity agencies, this must still translate into practical, effective action. Current frameworks often focus too heavily on individual infrastructures without fully considering the broader systemic risks posed by interconnectivity and technological convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, countries such as the UK, France, Germany and Italy all place the onus of protection primarily on the individual operators, which are responsible for identifying threats and countermeasures almost autonomously. It is true that all four countries mention information sharing and early warning as key enablers, but most operators of essential services have not integrated cyber risk into their broader risk management frameworks and, on the other side, national authorities struggle to have a systemic view of the national and sectorial risks, as confirmed by the lack of standards and taxonomies for sharing threat scenarios and impact on critical services. Another confirmation comes from the separation on the EU DORA regulation and the NIS2 directive between incident reporting and information sharing arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-integrated-civil-military-cyber-ecosystems&quot;&gt;Building Integrated Civil-Military Cyber Ecosystems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The convergence between military and civilian authorities in cybersecurity has become an essential component of national and collective defence strategies across NATO and allied nations. Institutional configurations, such as NATO’s Integrated Cyber Defence Centre, the US. Joint Cyber Defence Collaborative, and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre structurally embed cooperation between armed forces, intelligence agencies, civilian cyber authorities and critical infrastructure operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint cyber exercises – including NATO’s Cyber Coalition, US Cyber Guard, and Israel’s joint civil-military national drills (Cyber Dome) – serve as crucial testing grounds to rehearse coordinated responses to complex cyberattacks, strengthening interoperability between military cyber units, national CERTs, law enforcement and private-sector operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information-sharing mechanisms have been formalised through platforms like NATO’s Malware Information Sharing Platform, the UK’s Cyber Information Sharing Partnership, and the US Cyber Information Sharing and Collaboration Program, ensuring rapid, bidirectional threat intelligence flows between defence entities and civilian stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public–private partnerships have expanded with initiatives such as the UK’s Defence Cyber Protection Partnership and Israel’s close industry-military ties, reflecting the recognition that national defence relies heavily on securing privately operated critical infrastructure. Additionally, innovative models, such as Estonia’s volunteer Cyber Defence League and Israel’s fluid workforce between military units and the tech sector, illustrate how talent and expertise can seamlessly operate across civil and military spheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these convergence efforts have significantly matured, they often remain reactive, fragmented, or bound by temporary frameworks, primarily mobilised during crises rather than embedded as part of permanent national defence postures. Moreover, legal, cultural and operational barriers continue to slow the full institutionalisation of truly integrated civil-military cyber ecosystems. To overcome these limits, three decisive actions are needed to accelerate and consolidate civil-military cyber convergence into a cohesive and scalable model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, national cyber authorities should expand their strategies and frameworks to explicitly integrate the military dimension of cyber defence, establishing clear, permanent coordination mechanisms with armed forces to ensure comprehensive protection of national digital assets. This requires not only aligning responsibilities and processes but also fostering joint planning, information sharing and response protocols. At the NATO level, a common doctrinal and operational framework should be developed to guide member states, ensuring full interoperability in multinational contexts and enabling effective execution of multidomain operations, where cyber defence plays a critical role alongside traditional military domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, governments should expand the operational capabilities of their National Cyber Coordination Centres (NCCCs), transforming them into real-time operational hubs that integrate civilian, military and critical infrastructure actors. These centres should deliver shared situational awareness, fusing threat intelligence from military sources with civilian network monitoring to better predict the potential impacts of cyber threats on vital services and infrastructure. This joint operational picture would enable dynamic defence actions, improve proactive mitigation strategies and become indispensable during military operations that risk spilling over into the cyber domain – ensuring that civilian systems are defended and national resilience maintained during periods of heightened tension or conflict. Some countries such as the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Israel and Australia have already started this journey. Other national cyber authorities have started to integrate military personnel into their structure to create a stable channel with the military, like the Italian National Cyber Agency (ACN).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, an extended permanent cyber defence force (EPCDF) would address structural constraints and optimise national resources. This force would be composed of cybersecurity professionals who remain embedded in their civilian roles – whether in the private sector, critical infrastructure, research, or public administration – while being permanently integrated into national cyber defence efforts under military coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional reservist models, the EPCDF represents a constant, distributed defence capability operating in parallel with formal military structures, ensuring that national cyber defence is not only scalable and rapid but also deeply rooted within the systems it protects. Through joint training, shared platforms, and active participation in national cyber defence strategies, this network of civilian professionals would operate as a standing line of defence, turning the entire national cyber ecosystem into a strategic asset for deterrence, resilience, and response in both peacetime and crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three actions would transform today’s fragmented and reactive collaborations into a coherent, institutional and enduring national defence framework, bridging the military, civilian and private sectors as a unified force to counter increasingly complex and persistent cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this strategic landscape, the development of new frameworks – and, in military terms, a new doctrine – is no longer optional; it is essential. Addressing the challenges outlined above requires institutional initiatives to accelerate the doctrinal process, overcoming the inertia and timelines that traditionally characterise defence reform. Within NATO, the pathway from early conceptualisation to full doctrinal maturity can take up to a decade. When factoring in external actors such as EU institutions, national authorities and private-sector critical infrastructure providers, that timeline could stretch to 20 years before tangible impact is realised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is clearly untenable. What is needed is a fundamental acceleration of doctrine development, anchored in a new model of private-sector participation from the outset. This must be accompanied by the immediate, agile adoption of core principles to guide collaboration, resilience, and readiness across sectors. Institutions like the European Union, NATO, and leading research centres must play a catalytic role in initiating this shift – one that aligns strategic urgency with operational agility to meet the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent Conservative governments were increasingly concerned with recognising that defence spending should contribute to UK prosperity. The Labour government, elected in July 2024, has firmly underlined this stance. In its consultation paper on national industrial strategy, the defence sector is identified as a key sector for growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In government policy, private sector defence spending aims to further multiple goals. Spending is traditionally associated with enabling UK forces to deter and frustrate aggressive adversaries, but even this is not a simple matter when a sustained conventional conflict occurs. Today, the risks of relying on foreign suppliers appear to be higher than a decade ago. Further, the outputs of the defence industry become a foreign policy tool when they are provided to others, such as Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These considerations make the defence industry a cornerstone in generating UK security. But defence-focused installations, including military bases, do also provide employment and local spending for businesses and, formally since 2015, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has been charged with using funds to support greater national prosperity. Thus, although defence spending serves multiple purposes, government policy does not precisely direct how different ends are to be weighted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Philip Dunne, a former procurement minister, found when he prepared his report on the value of the defence industry to the UK economy, there is an information problem due to the multiple sectors that are involved with defence: the MoD buys everything from office furniture to combat aircraft. This paper points to findings about which there can be considerable confidence while also noting where more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the defence industry appears as a small element in the overall UK economy, it looms much larger once the most prosperous areas of the UK (London and the southeast) are removed from the picture. As the UK defence industry is predominantly located outside London, the importance of good salaries, a skilled workforce and above average productivity is enhanced when prosperity is the focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although defence is making increasing use of electronics and software, major weapons and platforms must be engineered and physically manufactured. Consequently, many defence industrial sites are located in areas that were part of the Industrial Revolution. Shipbuilding and its support are concentrated in historical coastal sites in Scotland and the southwest. Submarine building has become the maritime focus at Barrow-in-Furness in the northwest since the early 20th century. And as UK coastal areas are poorer than the overall UK average region, these defence sites play a significant role in sustaining economic stability in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aircraft became a national endeavour during the First and Second World Wars but their construction and design have since become concentrated around Blackburn and Preston in the northwest, although their engines and other subsystems are made elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While basic economic principles assert that the labour and capital resources of failing businesses will normally be taken over by others with better prospects, UK and wider international experience is that areas dominated by long-standing industries such as textiles, coal, steel, pottery and mechanical engineering take much longer to recover when such industries fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the defence industry in the UK should be recognised as a protection against impoverishment. There is wide recognition of the long-term social deprivation of a town where the workforce has been run down – for example, the shipyard’s workforce on the Trident programme in Barrow-in-Furness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence businesses in the UK also positively contribute to the development of the national economy. With a longer-term prospect of orders, defence businesses train apprentices and graduates, some of whom become available to the commercial economy. They push forward areas of technology, including digital engineering, which is starting to dominate most manufacturing sectors. Firms in defence supply chains must use MoD standards for the protection of their IT systems, which promotes cybersecurity both nationally and in firms that work on both military and commercial contracts. This includes large firms such as Leonardo, Rolls Royce and Airbus, as well as thousands of smaller firms. Additionally, the limited exposure of defence to commercial economic cycles supports both those firms and wider resilience when the wider economy is suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government has committed to factoring in the prosperity-generating aspect of defence to its defence equipment decisions. This can play a key role where economic infrastructure is otherwise degraded. However, the lack of concrete methods to measure prosperity-related impact often leaves this factor undervalued when deciding between international and domestic bids. This paper addresses this gap by offering a more nuanced perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significance and value of defence industry businesses have often been contested. This attitude can be traced back to post-First World War writing countering private sector involvement in supplying defence, President Dwight D Eisenhower’s warning about the power of a military–industrial complex, and debates about the impact of defence spending on economic growth. The 2020s have seen the rise of Environmental, Social and Governance standards that sometimes classify investing in defence as “unethical”. While this line of argument has been weakened by the acknowledgement of the defence industry’s importance in supporting Ukraine, it has re-emerged through controversies surrounding the Israel–Hamas war in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending on defence could be seen as a necessary evil. In an ideal world where armed forces were no longer needed, dismantling the defence industry would be a welcome challenge. Some felt this was the situation in the early 1990s: as demand for defence products declined, many defence companies sought business in the commercial world, which proved more difficult than expected. The leading UK example of failure concerned the General Electric Company (GEC), the large UK engineering and defence business, which sold its defence interests to BAE Systems in 1999 and moved into telecommunications a few years later. In the 2020s, changes in Russian foreign policy, an increasingly unstable Middle East and northern Africa, and China’s more assertive posture have generated a significant security agenda for Western countries. Equipping their armed forces adequately is back on the European political agenda. The UK government seeks independence in its use of and access to assured capabilities and materiel, pointing to the necessity of critical British industrial capabilities that can provide it. At the same time, political leaders are calling for defence choices to contribute to spreading prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 shows the multiple objectives and decisions to be served by defence spending with the private sector. Some are inter-related: for instance, operational independence is closely linked to, and even based on, industrial capability. While acknowledging all these areas, this paper focuses on prosperity and considers how the UK defence industry relates to UK economic prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has four chapters. Chapter I focuses on the key factors shaping the UK defence economy and considers the context of government policy towards the defence industry in the UK. This chapter also discusses the question of how much money is involved and considers the range of goods and services bought by the UK defence industry, and how much suppliers are focused on the defence market. Chapter II recognises that the defence industry is a relatively small part of the economy but with a disproportionate impact. Reasons for this include high pay levels, advanced technologies and the interactions between military and commercial work. The industry’s regional presence also plays a vital role, often supporting areas that are otherwise economically struggling. The chapter also considers the probable fate of defence sector-dependent areas should that business disappear. Chapter III outlines the areas in the UK in which it is likely that a significant defence industry will have a positive impact on the wider manufacturing base, where the development of skills and knowledge in defence include additive manufacturing technologies, communication technologies and digital engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-the-residual-data-problem&quot;&gt;Methodology: The Residual Data Problem&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper does not directly address the difficult question of how value in defence should be defined. It is a multifaceted concept that is subjective and dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper uses a range of existing datasets in its descriptive analysis, including government statistics, commercial studies and academic research. It also makes reference to studies from independent consultancies sponsored by individual large firms to assess their contributions to the economy. However, despite all this quantitative information, the complexity and scale of the defence industrial sector mean that much is still unknown. Former procurement minister Philip Dunne highlighted this in his 2018 report on defence in the economy. In response, during the same year, the Joint Economic Data Hub (JEDHub) was established within the Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) Defence Solutions Centre to enhance data collection and reporting on this area. The JEDHub has since published three annual reports, the latest in April 2024, which this paper uses for its analysis and on which it builds. For much of its information, the JEDHub relies significantly on the willingness of 22 companies to collect and send information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key issue with these statistics is the definition of “defence business”. As outlined in Chapter I, the range of products and services supplied to defence is broad. This paper focuses on the specialised defence business, as this sector is mostly not driven by traditional market dynamics. The complexity, the required expertise to develop and produce defence technology and the value of major defence products, such as platforms, mean that there is often only one or very few suppliers. At the same time, these suppliers have only one primary customer – the MoD. This makes the relationship between supply and demand special and requires policy to govern that relationship. One effect is that the MoD potentially has greater agency in shaping the market than it would in a market where it is one of many customers. This paper is concerned therefore with a key driver of that policy – the economic impact of UK defence businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key definitional problem remains: even businesses that specialise in defence technology may also have a substantive commercial business. Thus, there is a need to differentiate between their activities for defence and for the commercial market. This can be hard to describe statistically because of the lack of a distinct definition of what constitutes “defence business”. For instance, dual-use items may be primarily developed and produced both for defence and for the commercial sector. This has an impact on the effect that defence spending has on jobs associated with that business and is also difficult to measure. There is no easy way to establish the necessary share of a firm’s work being devoted to a defence product for it to qualify as a “defence business”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistical datasets struggle with accurately pinning down the regional impact of the defence industry. This is because regional data is often compiled from the address to which money is paid, but not necessarily from where the cost has been incurred. Also problematic is the challenge of discerning what contributes a “British defence business” when the headquarters is located overseas. At the turn of the millennium, the Blair government concluded that a range of factors impacted “Britishness”, including where technology was created, where skills and intellectual property resided, where jobs were, and where investment is made. Clearly these are related but separate elements, although the link between jobs and investment is normally close. A significant part of this framework was that the location of ownership and overall control was considered not relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the UK activities of firms such as Airbus, Leonardo, Thales, Raytheon and General Dynamics are all treated as “British” businesses, even though they are all foreign owned. They add significant value to UK jobs and the UK economy, are permitted to be members of the UK industrial body Aerospace, Defence &amp;amp; Security (ADS), and several were part of the former UK Defence Suppliers Forum. It should be stressed that there are many more foreign-owned businesses in the UK carrying out defence work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of decades of privatisation, almost all businesses supplying the MoD are in the private sector. Those whose shares are available on the London Stock Exchange can be bought by funds from around the world, although the government does keep an eye on foreign purchases that would give a controlling interest to foreign businesses. Additionally, over the last two decades, important second-tier UK-owned firms have been bought either by foreign primes (for example, Lucas Aerospace is now part of GE Aerospace), or by capital funds looking to generate more value through restructuring (while generating an option of selling off part, or the whole of, the business). GKN, bought by UK-based Melrose, Cobham, bought by Advent International and Ultra Electronics, bought by the now US-based Cobham share this experience. In early 2025, the latest target of a US investor has reportedly been the defensive aid business Chemring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this in mind, this paper uses the best information currently available, noting that the most common limitation in the JEDHub work is the omission of defence data rather than overstatement of defence claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-government-policy-on-the-defence-industry&quot;&gt;I. Government Policy on the Defence Industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper was primarily prepared in the context of previous Conservative government policy, which encouraged the MoD to use its resources to deliver on multiple objectives beyond securing military advantages for the UK’s armed forces. The 2021 Defence and Security Industrial Strategy referred to “critical industrial capabilities” as “a vital strategic asset in their own right”. Defence choices should provide the UK government with operational independence regarding the use of its armed forces, contribute to UK economic prosperity and levelling-up agendas, and strengthen the UK. The current Labour government’s January 2024 paper on safeguarding the UK made particular reference to the role of the defence industry in Northern Ireland. Since coming into office in July, the government has also underlined its expectation that the defence sector should benefit the UK economy. Its Green Paper on UK industrial policy identified the defence sector as a key sector to driving growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper directly addresses how to build, strengthen and sustain UK prosperity, with limited attention paid to the link between domestic industrial capability and the government’s desire for operational independence in its forces, which would be compromised if domestic defence firms fall short. However, the importance of operational independence should not be overlooked, especially as the UK aspires to use its forces for purposes other than the defence of national and allied territory. This paper also does not consider the economic impact of spending on governmental defence establishments in detail. However, it recognises that some military bases are of great local significance in terms of direct civil employment, as are those who deliver infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle, the current government could abandon all these policy stances, but its previous positions on defence suggest that this is unlikely. In fact, the government would like to generate further positive economic benefits from defence spending, and has identified defence as a key sector for economic advances in its first paper on national industrial strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-much-money-is-spent&quot;&gt;How Much Money is Spent?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MoD data for 2023/24 separates payments to the US government for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) items – which the US Department of Defense (DoD) then buys for the UK from US industry – from direct transactions with UK and overseas industry. The MoD knows that some FMS work is carried out in the UK, particularly with the F-35 fighter aircraft, and reports its value. The MoD also reports on spending directly with industry worldwide and the proportion that is spent in the UK. Thus, it is possible to discern how much money has been spent in the UK and how much has been spent overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total amount spent by the MoD globally with UK and foreign-owned organisations was £38.2 billion in 2023/4, of which £600 million was on FMS deals with the US. Of this, the total spent with UK firms was £28.8 billion. Excluding mine-protected vehicles for Afghanistan and Iraq, such as Mastiff and Ridgeback, the list of platforms bought from the US in the last 15 years includes C-17 transport aircraft, F-35s, Predator remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAs), Reaper RPAs, Apache A-64E attack helicopters, Rivet Joint electronic intelligence aircraft, Chinook helicopters, Wedgetail airborne command and control aircraft and P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft. The latest data from the US State Department (published in 2019) showed that the UK imported three times more defence equipment from the US than Germany did, and seven times more than France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence firms and the government seek to use the domestic defence goods and services market as the basis for exports to foreign governments. The scale of exports is a matter of some contention since the data collected in the UK and published by the government typically addresses orders rather than the deliveries that often follow years later. The data shows that the five-year average of defence exports between 2018 and 2022 was around £10 billion a year, equivalent to 40–50% of what the UK MoD buys overall. The aerospace sector dominates defence exports and the Gulf states have emerged as major customers. However, the full picture is more complex. Rolls-Royce and Leonardo sell important subsystems, such as radars, to a wider range of customers. The Swedish Gripen, for instance, has a Leonardo radar from the UK, some Japanese ships have Rolls-Royce engines, the New Zealand navy has MBDA missiles, and BAE Systems has provided technical help for other national combat aircraft programmes, including in Sweden and Korea. There is no assurance that UK-developed and UK-built military equipment would succeed in export markets, but extensive reliance on imports certainly erodes the UK defence industry’s export potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-does-the-ministry-of-defence-buy-and-from-whom&quot;&gt;What Does the Ministry of Defence Buy, and from Whom?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goods and services used by the defence industry span a vast range of categories. At one end, governmental defence customers require generic commercial goods and services, such as office furniture, sports clothing for soldiers, fuel and catering services. There are many potential suppliers in these areas, and the MoD is just one of multiple customers, and could account for just a small part of such firms’ sales. Moreover, the entry barriers for firms trying to break into most of these areas are modest in terms of the required expertise, facilities and finance. New firms can come in while poorer performers disappear. Such commercial products have many characteristics of perfect markets on which much of conventional economics is based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the large middle are firms supplying goods and services on a commercial basis, but which involve little to major modification to make them suitable for defence use. Trucks, roll-on roll-off ferries, some helicopter types and some UAVs have these attributes. A useful delineator of such goods is whether they are defined in export control law and regulation as dual-use goods requiring export licences before they can be sold to a foreign customer. The UK list of dual-use goods is extensive, covering some 350 pages in the government’s Export Control List. The list also contains 36 pages for specialised defence areas, such as combat aircraft, artillery pieces, armoured vehicles and warships. Suppliers of major platforms and systems for defence tend to have very different problems, opportunities and natures from those in the commercial world. There is just one key initial customer for a UK specialised defence supplier – the MoD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ministry-of-defence-and-armed-forces-as-sole-buyers&quot;&gt;The Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces as Sole Buyers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navies, air forces and, to an increasing extent, armies rely on platforms to move and indeed to operate. Platforms are thus important, with many remaining in service for decades. For example, there was a 20-year gap between one UK Army order for an armoured combat vehicle (Challenger 2 in 1994) and the next (Ajax in 2014). For firms required to develop, produce and sell such platforms, a viable business model can be difficult to specify because national orders can be rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When intervals have been long between domestic orders of a military product category, the unsuccessful firm in a bidding competition, or even the winning firm, often either closes or sells that part of its business. Other firms have behaved similarly when they believed that their overall defence order prospects were too limited. In 1989, General Electric, Plessey, Vickers Shipbuilding &amp;amp; Engineering, Devonport Management, Ferranti, Hunting, Racal, Thorn EMI, Vickers plc and Westland were among the 18 suppliers listed by the MoD as among its top suppliers paid more than £100 million in 1987–88. Today, none exist as a separate entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, UK defence in 2025 is often marked by a monopsony buyer (one buyer among many sellers) facing an oligopoly or even a monopoly seller. This is not just a UK phenomenon, with oligopolies or even national champion companies facing the defence ministries of countries such as France, Germany and even the US. After 1993, as noted by Michael Brown, “America’s 50 main defense suppliers consolidated to five. Today, the top six suppliers to the U.S. Department of Defense receive two-thirds of all procurement dollars”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies survive in the sector through export orders and by generating required upgrades to older systems. However, it is never easy to sell a defence product internationally that has not been endorsed – that is, bought by the armed forces of that company’s national government. Moreover, a growing number of countries are seeking to develop their own defence industrial capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is here that several policy directions meet. The UK government wants operational independence regarding the use of its forces, which means the UK should enjoy access to a capable industrial base. To survive commercially, a firm requires continuity in development, production and support work. For national and regional prosperity, a region needs defence businesses that provide secure and sustained opportunities. A firm might struggle to attract and train specialised young staff if they will only have a job in their locality for eight or nine years. The Appledore shipyard in Devon, for example, had minimal work once it had completed its blocks of the Queen Elizabeth-class carriers. Babcock closed the shipyard in 2019, and its yard in Rosyth, Scotland has no assured shipbuilding work once the five Type 31 fleet is completed. There is uncertainty about the Type 32 project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boards and personnel of major defence firms should not be drawn into complacency and must be aware that their position depends on their delivery record, creating a synergistic relationship between government and defence business. If firms perform well, they enjoy security and the government obtains operational independence and military capability. If companies fall short, they are likely to lose their business with the government, and the government will have to turn to foreign suppliers. The price of this, for government, is the loss of a credible claim to operational independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some firms that have a significant defence portfolio can choose whether they will focus entirely on defence sector equipment or whether they want to also compete in the commercial sector. In a comparison of three UK firms in the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), BAE Systems is 96% dependent on revenue from defence sector products; Leonardo 75%; and Rolls-Royce 25%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deeper investigations go into supply chains, the more it is revealed that firms address both defence and commercial markets. Every firm has its own concept of how defence work fits into its overall strategy and business model. Specialised defence products contain components, and even subsystems, that are produced by firms serving both commercial and military markets, and it is likely that there are more than 10,000 firms in the UK that have some defence business. From a prosperity perspective, a crucial, yet unresearched, question concerns the extent to which a mixed commercial–military firm benefits from more defence work or suffers from its cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To contain external dependence while seeking the claimed benefits of competition and maintaining access to advanced systems, successive governments in the UK have allowed, or even encouraged, foreign defence firms to invest in the UK. Each firm has its own individual pattern of activity, which can address some or all R&amp;amp;D, manufacturing and support activities. Airbus, Leonardo, MBDA and Thales are the most prominent firms from Europe operating in the UK, while General Dynamics (about 1,500 employees), Lockheed Martin (about 1,700) and Raytheon (about 2,000) are the larger US firms operating in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further feature of the market for many defence systems is that the purchase price is often just the beginning, with direct in-service costs exceeding the purchase within a decade. A US DoD memorandum observed 15 years ago that: “Sustainment costs have five to ten times more impact on total life cycle costs than do RDT&amp;amp;E [research, development, test and evaluation] costs”. Frontline defence equipment is still generally designed for high-level performance rather than the maintenance-free operating periods that form the basis for most commercial equipment. Military platforms and many of their subsystems are supplied and supported on the basis of mean time between failure rates that would be unacceptable in commercial markets. The US is more open about availability than the UK: in 2021, across the US Air Force, for every 10 aircraft in its possession, three were unavailable at any one point in time. As of 2022, all variants of the F-35 had lower availability rates than this. Other reports indicate that the situation has not much improved, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors mean that defence maintenance, repair and overhaul absorb significant costs, but also provide much work for the industry. Many in-service needs can only be supplied by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), which may opt to offer a modest initial purchase price, knowing that it can charge handsomely for parts supply and related services over the following decades. Total in-service costs are much harder to calculate than “sticker prices” and are much less available in the public domain. However, particularly with combat aircraft, UK governments have pursued in-service support savings by contracting with the lead companies for availability and reliability rather than simply supplying parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increasing challenge in the 2020s is that there is an opportunity, and in some cases a need, for regular upgrades to military equipment as opposed to just maintenance and repair, given the increased electronic content and software of many systems. In defence (as in the commercial world), firms are usually reluctant to transfer full intellectual property (IP) rights to a user, which would be needed for the government to make its own arrangements for the modification and even repair of equipment. Understandably, some governments are seeking to weaken the power of OEMs, but this is not easy given legitimate concerns about safety, fair trade and the commercial importance of IP for the firm involved. The bottom line is that in defence, the governmental customer can feel itself to be subject to vendor lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence industrial capabilities and behaviours are also central to governmental efforts to protect the country and the government’s perception of the national interest. Happily, for the most part, defence activities are focused on deterrence and capability preparation, but actual military operations often place special demands on the industrial sector. Experience of protracted conflicts, including the Second World War, the Korean War and the ongoing war in Ukraine, have demonstrated the value of access to a strong and agile supply base. Maria Eagle, the UK Minister for Defence Procurement, observed at RUSI in March 2025:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amidst the uncertainty surrounding European security … one thing … is certain and that’s a fighting force is only as strong as the industrial base that stands behind it. So transforming European defence industrial capabilities and boosting capacity are going to be integral to this defining mission of our time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the more recent British military operational activities, despite being less intense on an order of magnitude, placed urgent demands on the supply base. All these considerations result in the choice of this paper to focus on defence in the economy rather than “defence economics”, as well as why the government, like others, has accepted that the defence industrial base should be viewed as a strategic asset. However, as noted earlier in the Methodology section on data issues, there is no clear specification of which defence suppliers qualify as sufficiently British to be a strategic asset. What is most likely to interest the MoD, from an industrial capability perspective, is a firm’s capacity in R&amp;amp;D, integration and production, as well as support and upgrades. From a wealth-creation perspective, the scale of employment and salary levels should also loom large. Each of these considerations should inform the MoD’s approach to choosing firms, which will in turn inform the government’s strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-key-economic-contributions-of-defence-firms&quot;&gt;II. Key Economic Contributions of Defence Firms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter addresses the economic consequences of defence spending with the private sector rather than the consequences of defence spending overall. There is an argument that suitable defence spending boosts investor confidence, because defence spending assures potential investors that a country is unlikely to be attacked (and is thus a safe investment), but this is not addressed in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defence-can-appear-economically-insignificant&quot;&gt;Defence Can Appear Economically Insignificant&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National economic statistics signal that defence should be a minor factor in the UK economy. Defence’s share of the economy, at a little over 2.3% of GDP, has reduced from its Cold War percentage share (4.1%) and considerably reduced from what its share of GDP was 50 years ago (5.1%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence has become a small part of the national R&amp;amp;D effort. The Office of National Statistics reported governmental R&amp;amp;D spending in 2022 as £2.1 billion on defence, with £13.4 billion focused on commercial purposes. For the economy as a whole, a parliamentary study notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows that, in 2020, total public and private expenditure on R&amp;amp;D in the UK was £61.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, along with government funding from UK Research and Innovation, defence may be ready to support projects with a more distant return than that of some commercial firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding employment, MoD data for 2022/23 shows that defence accounted for a total of 434,000 UK jobs, which constitutes one in 60 UK jobs. Of these, 239,000 were in the private sector, and the MoD employed 58,000 civilians and 142,000 service personnel in the UK. (The private sector numbers exclude those involved in the promotion and delivery of defence exports.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The employment significance of exports is almost impossible to decipher since the levels of exports and the numbers of people involved varies from year to year. Thus, the significance of exports must include their potential to provide a continuity of work once UK needs have been met, which in turn sustains the industrial capabilities needed for the development and production of future systems. For some years, Thales in Belfast sustained a workforce and capability in anti-tank and short-range air defence missiles through exports. The RAF took delivery of its last Typhoon in 2019 and production has been sustained by sales to Austria, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, as well as additional deliveries to collaborative partner countries. At the 2024 Berlin airshow, Germany announced that it would be buying an additional 20 aircraft to cover the period until approximately 2040 (when the Franco-German SCAF aircraft should come into service).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of ships, although the sales of the Type 26 frigate to Australia and Canada mainly involve the design (the vessels will be built in the customer states), there are some subsystems involved that will be made in the UK. The same is true of the three Type 31 ships being bought by Poland. There are hopes of further sales of both vessels. Under Patrick Sanders as Chief of the General Staff, the Army focused on equipment modernisation and relationships with industry. In a keynote speech in 2023, Sanders said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Like many other nations and Defence industries, we have studied the war carefully, identifying and learning valuable lessons which are shaping our decisions for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At RUSI, I trailed our initial response to these lessons and we have forged a credible plan for the British Army’s renewal. Renewal to make sure we can fight the war we must. A renewal founded in hard-won lessons of the past, orientated to the future to ensure that we emerge more lethal, agile, expeditionary and resilient, all underpinned by our digital framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This renewal is delivering now and gathering momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also underlined the need and opportunities for more exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its modest size, the defence industry has features that give it greater importance than numbers without context would imply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;high-productivity-pay-and-levels-of-knowledge-and-skills&quot;&gt;High Productivity, Pay and Levels of Knowledge and Skills&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence firms feature high productivity rates, offer high salaries and are adept at generating knowledge and skills. JEDHub data shows that value added per employee is high in defence, with gross value added estimated in 2022 at £112,000, compared with the national average in manufacturing as a whole of £81,062.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the national level, the JEDHub (as well as company-sponsored studies) finds that salaries in the defence sector are higher than the UK average, and that salaries in the defence sector are higher than UK average pay in the manufacturing sector specifically. While this could make some government officials complain that the MoD is paying more than it should for its private sector labour, defence firms are under clear pressure to pay what is required to recruit and retain their expert staff, whose training they have often significantly funded. Moreover, firms serving both military and commercial markets, such as Rolls-Royce and Leonardo, who move their staff around, do not pay their employees in the commercial sector less than they do those in the military domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EYer0qT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: MoD Expenditure Per Capita with UK Industry by Region 2023/24.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/mod-regional-expenditure-statistics-with-industry-202324&quot;&gt;MoD, “MOD Regional Expenditure with Industry 2023/24”, 21 November 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it could be argued that higher wages come at the expense of creating more, albeit lower-paying, jobs through government spending in other areas. However, higher salaries mean higher disposable incomes and a more significant multiplier effect in terms of supporting a wide range of businesses. For example, a 2024 study by Oxford Economics of Leonardo’s economic impact in the UK showed average wages at Leonardo Yeovil of £51,000 compared with the overall local average of £32,000, and that every Leonardo and Leonardo-supported job in its supply chain generated about a third of a job through employees’ spending in the wider economy. Oxford Economics also researched similar salaries and multiplier effect ratios for Leonardo’s Edinburgh electronics firm and other smaller UK sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higher salaries also mean that the government gets more than a third of its defence industrial spending in the UK directly back in the form of national insurance payments, income tax, corporation tax and VAT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that the eventual net cost to government revenues will be small when a foreign bid has succeeded, provided that an unsuccessful UK bidder has other projects to work on. But defence is a de facto UK government monopsony, meaning that a similar opportunity is often unavailable. As noted, British defence firms have been subject to multiple takeovers and plant closures over decades. This issue is discussed later in this paper in the section The Consequences of Defence Cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further consideration is that while defence firms employ a high number of people from science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) backgrounds, they also train a large number of apprentices who become everything from skilled tradespeople to chartered engineers. For example, more than 10% of Leonardo’s employees in Luton and Edinburgh are graduate trainees, apprentices or placement students. In 2022, BAE Systems said it had invested approximately “£100m in education, skills and early careers activities in the UK annually”. In 2025, it will have a record 6,500 people in training, around 15% of its UK workforce. Such qualified young people become an important part of the UK’s overall stock of knowledgeable and skilled personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view that defence firms do not spend their own money on R&amp;amp;D also needs to be qualified. Much of defence is R&amp;amp;D intensive and, while most defence funding comes from government, the 2024 JEDHub report found that up to 30% of defence R&amp;amp;D funding comes from the private sector. In relation to the wider economy, Dunne’s report observes that: “Historically, there has been a strong correlation between defence research and technological advances across society”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK governments usually make sure an announcement of a contract with a UK firm mentions how many jobs will be sustained and/or created, to allay any doubt regarding the positive economic consequences of defence spending. Also, perhaps as an effort to win favour from the first Trump administration, a British defence official based in Washington stressed in 2018 that British defence spending was increasing to America’s benefit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That’s not only good for strengthening our defense capabilities; it’s excellent news for the U.S. We’re focusing on American priorities, like counterterrorism, while bolstering the U.S. economy. This year, European allies are buying more than $35 billion of American products, such as F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, Poseidon P-8A Maritime Patrol Aircraft, Reaper drones, and billions of dollars in Patriot missile defense. UK’s defense spending alone is helping to employ more than 160,000 Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A month later, then-secretary of state Gavin Williamson repeated this number (of defence-supported jobs) to a Washington DC audience. If the MoD recognises that UK spending in the US benefits the US economy, it must also recognise that defence spending at home helps with the UK economy. Similarly, if it is accepted that technology and manufacturing are important foundations even for a service-based economy, it is significant that defence appears to be in excess of 10% of total British manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-value-of-defence-business-in-a-commercialdefence-firm&quot;&gt;The Value of Defence Business in a Commercial–Defence Firm&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to generalise about the extent that businesses which work with defence find such work to be helpful in sustaining and developing their commercial work. Even at the top level, firms vary in their strategies and market focuses. While BAE Systems and QinetiQ are dominated by defence, Rolls-Royce receives only about 30% of its revenue from defence. In terms of the commercial–defence links, much of the technical workforce in Rolls-Royce has the ability to work in either side. Babcock received 68% of its 2023 revenue from the defence sector and presents itself as serving defence, security and commercial markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While defence spending is most visible in terms of the large primes that dominate major projects, and while governments for some years have sought to bring more (innovative) small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) into defence, it is easy to overlook the fact that major firms already outsource much of their activity and have hundreds of identified firms in their supply chains. Oxford Economics and individual companies’ reports provide evidence of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Babcock International 2022:&lt;/strong&gt; “£1bn spent with more than 5,700 UK suppliers, including £230m spent with 1,070 suppliers in deprived local authority areas, and £337m spent with 2,200 SMEs”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leonardo 2020:&lt;/strong&gt; “Two thirds of Leonardo’s 2,100 UK suppliers were small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and more than a quarter (28%) of all Leonardo supply chain spending was spent directly with these SMEs”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BAE Systems 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; “More than 3,000 contractors [are] employed by BAE Systems as part of its procurement spending”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rolls-Royce&lt;/strong&gt; (with its larger civil business) spends £2.3 billion a year with more than 2,300 companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The degree of corporate dependence on defence reduces further down supply chains. Certainly, many members of ADS, MAKE UK Defence and Tech UK (the industrial bodies that support access to the defence market), have members serving the commercial world as well. The perceived benefit of having some defence business is reflected in the growing number of companies joining these bodies. As mentioned earlier, another consideration is that supplying defence requires all firms to have high cybersecurity standards, which should enhance their overall resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this constitutes hard evidence of the benefits of defence work, but it does signal that many firms see access to both sectors as beneficial. Spirit AeroSystems in Northern Ireland explicitly pursued the defence market as a strategy because, having experienced the collapse of commercial air transport during the Covid-19 pandemic, it recognised defence as a valuable counter-cyclical element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An issue worth detailed research concerns the wider impact of defence work on dual-use suppliers. For example, can longer-term defence contracts justify capital investments that a predominance of short-term commercial contracts would make more risky? And can gaps between work be a difficulty for dual-use firms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these considerations suggest that, as a generalisation, defence business appears to have a higher impact on the UK economy than a superficial look would suggest. This message is reinforced when regional and local needs are considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-local-and-regional-economic-impact-of-defence&quot;&gt;The Local and Regional Economic Impact of Defence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence industrial and wider economic considerations loom larger once London is excluded from the picture. MoD data shows that London only gets around £2 billion in defence spending – around 7% of the total. London accounts for 13% of the UK population but 23% of GDP. In brief, although London has some very poor areas, it is much richer than the rest of the UK, while not receiving much from the defence budget. GDP per head in London was £69,000 in 2023. GDP per head in the southeast made it the next highest income region at £41,319. This high level in the southeast might be surprising, but the delineation of naval facilities in and around Portsmouth, plus army facilities in the southeast, contribute to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the MoD’s top 10 suppliers has major defence manufacturing installations in the southeast, but BAE Systems employs around 650 staff at Frimley, who carry out IT and ship support work. Airbus is now the owner of Surrey Satellites, based in Guildford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing defence spending per capita in different areas with GDP per capita suggests the positive impact of defence (except in the southeast). Defence spending per capita is high in the northwest, the southwest and Scotland. These regions, despite having either extensive coastal boundaries or significantly de-industrialised communities, have slightly higher GDP per capita than any other UK region (except London and the southeast). For the southwest, there is little defence activity in Cornwall compared with other counties in the region. It is possibly not a coincidence that it has higher unemployment and lower pay than the overall southwest region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition that defence spending in a local area can be of significance is reflected in the focused interest that MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland show in whether their regions are getting their share of defence, however “defence” is defined. The Scottish Affairs Committee has completed a series of inquiries, with those members who oppose Scottish independence looking for evidence of the benefits of being in the UK. The Scottish National Party finds it awkward to oppose shipbuilding links with the rest of the UK that bring so many benefits to Scotland. The Welsh Affairs Committee can see how little defence work has come to their area, and the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee is in a similar place. Both the Northern Ireland and Wales inquiries established by these committees were terminated due to the June 2024 general election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;government-revenues-and-the-balance-of-trade&quot;&gt;Government Revenues and the Balance of Trade&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government has a significant budget deficit problem, and the country has a long-standing balance of trade deficit. It is therefore of some significance to assess the impact of the defence industry on these matters. In terms of the trade deficit, a foreign defence product clearly constitutes an import, which presents a challenge for a country that imports more than it exports over a sustained period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is incontestable that, when the MoD spends government money in the private sector, some of that becomes revenue to the Treasury in the form of tax. At first glance, free-market economics would argue that, if well-paid defence jobs were not available, those affected would quickly find other well-paid sources of employment (which would mean they paid similar amounts of tax). For some this will indeed be the case, while others will opt for early retirement, albeit on a reduced pension income. Some will take time to find new work and weigh on government spending rather than contribute financially to the Treasury. Here it could be said that the burden of proof lies with those who argue against the assertions in a 2012 RUSI Briefing Paper which demonstrated that, on a contract involving no foreign elements, the government would get back as much as 36% directly in the form of income tax, national insurance and other direct payments to government, without any multiplier effects included in the calculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exports present a slightly different situation. A UK or collaborative product may or may not generate foreign exchange revenues from exports, depending on its commercial terms. But it is quite clear that a product bought from a foreign supplier, such as Apache E or Predator, can only be an import. This is not an argument for rejecting foreign products when the frontline military case is strong and/or there is no capable supplier in the UK. But security of supply in the support phase, and operational independence, are other factors that affect import decisions – as is clearly considered when the US buys an overseas defence product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-consequences-of-defence-cuts&quot;&gt;The Consequences of Defence Cuts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument so far is that defence work has wider benefits than might be assumed, but there is a further issue. What can be observed about the impact of reduced defence spending and a lack of defence orders? In mid-2024 there was uncertainty about the affordability of the defence programme, so such reductions cannot be ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, adjustment to defence closures has been easiest in regions with a diversified, already prospering economy. Here, those affected by a defence firm closure may be able to quickly find other ways of contributing to the economy, and any abandoned infrastructure would get reused. The closures of BAE Systems factories at Kingston, Hatfield and Enfield have not affected long-term local prosperity – at Hatfield, for instance, the site of the Flight Test Hangar “is currently a David Lloyd Leisure Centre and hotel”. In diversified, prosperous areas, other activities can usually replace closed defence entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is also clear that, in many areas of the UK, the loss of major industries has had major negative repercussions for decades. Many of the towns and areas that were at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution have seen the decline of their traditional industries (especially textiles, coal, steel and heavy engineering) in the face of foreign competition from countries with less expensive labour and/or more efficient working practices. Many of these places, not least the north and some parts of the West Midlands, did not experience the speedy replacement of a failed firm with well-paid jobs, and their populations have instead suffered sustained periods of unemployment, low pay and social deprivation. The employment and value added by an Amazon warehouse near a motorway exit differ from the benefits of a thriving factory. Social deprivation is a multidimensional concept with a range of metrics, several of which are inter-related: low wages, unemployment, poor levels of educational performance, poor health and crime. Once in place, it is difficult to improve social deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further consideration is that coastal areas in the UK are poorer, have poorer health and more crime than their inland neighbours. By definition, they are peripheral rather than “core” UK locations, and many have not experienced a replacement for UK tourists moving to international destinations or for the decline of the fishing industry. In the defence domain, a report in March 2024 covered the current revitalisation of Chatham, albeit 40 years after the closure of its naval dockyard. Industrial sites by the coast thus have a special economic and social significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town of Barrow-in-Furness, for example, had a highly negative experience when there was no design work for a new submarine for almost 20 years between the Vanguard and Astute projects, and Astute manufacturing did not start until three years after the completion of the last Vanguard. Indeed, as the shipyard’s number of employees dropped from 14,000 to 3,000, the town went into a major decline, although some were able to find work at the neighbouring Sellafield nuclear installation. This resulted in more people living on social security payments and increased drug use. Male unemployment in the constituency was 7.3% in 1998. In 2001, data showed that there were almost half as many economically inactive males in Barrow-in-Furness as those measured as economically active. Poor educational standards became a feature, with almost 50% of the adult population having no formal qualifications and another 20% with only Level 1 qualifications. Almost 2,000 people had never worked or were long-term unemployed. A significant question that merits future research (but may prove tricky in terms of data access) is to what degree running down the shipyard contributed to the region becoming less a contributor to government tax revenues and instead a greater burden on social security spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of industrial capability, defence suffered as the restoration of submarine building proved a protracted, difficult and expensive process. According to John Schank and others, “submarine design and build skills atrophied in the United Kingdom, resulting in a costlier and lengthier Astute procurement effort”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maturing of Astute production and the start of Dreadnought-class building has contributed highly to the restoration of employment in and around Barrow-in-Furness: BAE Systems reported in 2024 that its “submarines business already employs approximately 13,500 people, mainly in the North West of England, with that figure set to grow to around 17,000 in the coming years”. This has required, and been accompanied by, improvements in education and cultural opportunities. Given the labour demands of the Astute and Dreadnought programmes, and plans for the Astute successor, BAE Systems felt it necessary to establish its own education and training centre (Academy for Skills and Knowledge) and its website proclaims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Barrow-in-Furness is a hub for learning and innovation. We’re not just building the next generation of nuclear submarines here. We’re developing the next generation of engineering talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, cutting defence work often quickly leads to levelling down when no comparable new opportunities arrive, and bringing about recovery using defence money is a protracted process. There has been progress in Barrow-in-Furness, but there is still a way to go. The government’s March 2024 nuclear white paper detailed the multi-year efforts being made to rejuvenate the town with a major waterfront housing development, improved education provision and a decade-long, £20-million-a-year Barrow Transformation Fund, all aimed at encouraging “more people to come to live and work in the area”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of sustained economic difficulties in areas that led the first Industrial Revolution, the survival of defence aerospace and missile firms in the northwest takes on added significance. BAE Systems, with core factories near Preston and Blackburn, contributes significantly to local prosperity. BAE Systems also uses multiple subcontractors in a regional cluster. Also in the northwest, MBDA has a modernised missile factory in Bolton, which employed “670 highly skilled design, engineering and manufacturing employees” when it opened in 2018. As of January 2024, the company employs more than 1,000 people and has plans to triple its workforce in future years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering that defence cuts would likely mean levelling down an area for a sustained period, naval work conducted entirely in coastal locations merits particular attention. UK warship building is focused on the Govan and Scotstoun yards near Glasgow and the Babcock site at Rosyth, also in Scotland. These sites are currently busy building Type 26 and Type 31 ships, but what will come next (if current work is successfully completed) has not been confirmed. There is also extensive ship support work in Portsmouth, Devonport (Plymouth) and Faslane. Because of the overall reduced size of the Royal Navy, there is now much less of this type of work. Gosport, adjacent to Portsmouth, is now recognised as one of the more deprived areas of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeovil, the home of Leonardo helicopters, is unusual. Its rural location was important to a new firm called Westland Aircraft during the First World War, when the aircraft industry came to life. The company survived the downturn in defence spending after the end of that conflict and after the Second World War the company focused on helicopter technology. In 2024, Leonardo was directly employing around 3,000 people in a town of just over 40,000 inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Westland Aircraft is owned by Italian firm Leonardo, and the Italian side of its helicopter business is larger than the British element of the business. However, the latter still works on development, production and support for both military and commercial helicopters. A factory with such a long history and significance is inevitably a key presence in its community. To ensure it has suitably qualified and motivated young people to come into its workforce, it actively supports local education. Nonetheless, Yeovil’s future is uncertain. In recent years the MoD has turned increasingly to US helicopter suppliers, opting for the Apache E helicopter (with no role for Leonardo), and buying more Chinook helicopters. With the Wildcat helicopter production completed, and despite Leonardo having a strategic partnership agreement with the MoD, the (MoD) initial decision was to use a formal competition for the next military helicopter (the New Medium Helicopter, NMH) – with Airbus and Lockheed-Martin chosen alongside Leonardo as viable bidders. In April 2024, the MoD bought six Airbus H145 helicopters as Puma replacements for deployment in Cyprus and Brunei. Later in 2024, Airbus and Lockheed-Martin withdrew from the NMH competition, and as of April 2025 there was no firm MoD commitment to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leonardo does, however, have a £50-million, four-year MoD contract agreed in 2022 to generate Proteus, a flying demonstrator of an uncrewed naval helicopter that, when developed, could carry out surveillance, supply and casualty missions. Proteus could also substitute, to a degree, for the EH-101 Merlin helicopter. The project has been pursued on an incremental basis and is intended to provide employment for about 100 development engineers in Yeovil until 2026. If Leonardo closed in Yeovil, the town would likely become another (seasonal) tourist centre, although the southwest region has a wide range of defence industrial capabilities which in 2025 its companies came together to publicise and attract further work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A feature of domestic defence industrial capabilities is that they can provide a variety of benefits. When successful, they can serve as a conspicuous symbol of national technological and management capability, support both the reality and the image of a government with meaningful sovereign freedoms and enable an armed force to secure access to equipment with its preferred characteristics. They can provide stable and well-paid employment, deliver tax revenues and reduce a government’s foreign exchange needs. In this situation, it is not surprising that ever more countries are seeking to enhance their domestic defence industrial capacity, with many having formal offset regulations to stimulate advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-the-potential-of-the-defence-industry&quot;&gt;III. The Potential of the Defence Industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter outlines the key areas in which defence could make contributions to the wider manufacturing base in the UK. Their impact has been of particular interest to the current government, which pledged to harness it further through defence investments, stating: “Defence and strategic capability play a unique role in our economy, providing both high-skilled jobs and spillover innovation, as well as supporting Britain’s position on the world stage”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating defence spending more closely with economic benefit would imply maintaining the previous government’s focus on developing UK products for which there was also an export market. The GCAP and Type 31 projects are both instances of the UK aiming to generate a core product (with a minimum deployable capability) that would be affordable in export markets and modifiable to meet the specific needs of a customer. Currently, Australia and Canada are working to modify the Type 26 to meet local needs, while both Poland and Indonesia are interested in buying their own versions of the Type 31.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A government seeking to improve the wider economic benefit from defence would consider the wider potential of the technologies in a defence project. Some focused technologies, such as those involved with gas turbines, have applications in both military and commercial products. Others can be understood as almost general purpose technologies, with applications in multiple domains: for example, the electric motor. At least four areas in the defence industry stand out as having many commercial applications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aerospace&lt;/strong&gt; has been defined in dual-use terms since its inception. The RAF was supplied until 1964 by the Air Ministry, which had responsibility for both the military and commercial worlds. On the commercial side was the Society of British Aerospace Companies, which transformed into ADS in 2009. The lead professional body is the Royal Aeronautical Society, founded in 1866, and it also has both commercial and military agendas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In (outer) space&lt;/strong&gt;, challenges and opportunities for sensors and communication abound. This can be subdivided into ground installations, launchers and satellites. UK industrial progress was long neglected by the MoD on the grounds of expense and a readiness to rely on US capabilities, but the small-satellite achievements of Surrey Satellites, plus falling launch costs and participation in some European programmes, have resulted in some changes in attitude. A National Space Strategy was announced in 2021 as a joint effort of the MoD and the (then) Department of Business, Energy &amp;amp; Industrial Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital engineering&lt;/strong&gt; is destined to become the central driver behind manufacturing advances. Of great interest to defence, but also of huge commercial potential, is the integration of a range of focused digital technologies into a digital engineering whole. GCAP is a demanding product for digital engineering, but it could generate a large, informed workforce and multiple lessons to be learned through integrated digitisation. These lessons learned could be curated and mechanisms put in place to make them available across the whole UK manufacturing sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computing, AI, machine learning and data science&lt;/strong&gt; are key enablers of digital engineering but also have huge implications for many decision-making activities, including modelling, empirical analysis of data from multiple sources, recommendations for risk assessments, and commitment to an action. In the defence sector, AI is not a new phenomenon: defence has been using advanced data processing and analysis for decades. But AI is advancing quickly and will have many commercial uses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these four fields, there are more specific areas on the defence agenda, including advanced materials with weight, strength and radar absorption attributes. Additionally, power generation, storage and distribution technologies have the potential to provide mobile capabilities and reduce the use of fossil fuels. Such fields also have commercial applications and potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For defence to lead on technologies with wider applications, defence systems must work in a much more hostile environment than most commercial products. Organised crime and governments pursuing deniable attacks on civilians are blurring this distinction, but it still carries core validity. For example, how long would “self-driving” cars work once those who wished to subvert them resort to using the electromagnetic spectrum to interfere with their connectivity. The reverse argument also can be offered: if a technology has been demonstrated to work in a military context, it will almost always also work in a commercial one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To generate enhanced macroeconomic benefit from military progress, it will not be enough to entrust defence work to firms with a dual-use output. Some firms choose strategically to focus on defence because of the background knowledge this requires about defence challenges, organisational structures and procurement procedures. Also, those who invest in defence firms bring a risk perspective over a portfolio of activities: sometimes they do not embrace diversification in those firms but rather see defence investments as generating modest, but low-risk, returns because of the long-term nature of contracts and the assured financial survival of the customer. This does not make commercial spin-offs within defence companies impossible, but it involves choices that should be seen as strategic rather than opportunistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government needs to think hard about how it will make the nature of dual-use but defence-origin technology advances available to the wider UK economy. This will include specifying the security classifications of a technology to allow dissemination but prevent undesirable releases to non-UK firms and governments. There could be pressure on the MoD to continue to support defence companies in defence-dependent areas, even if the outputs of those companies have lost much of their security relevance. This consideration would be less important if regions that are currently defence-dependent had a more diversified economy. Supporting firms that could use the skills and knowledge found in the defence sector and improving infrastructure in neglected areas of the UK would also help. But a broader point is that government, military and industrial leaders need to be thinking ahead to innovative products and new routes to military capabilities. All this implies that, while the defence sector already can be seen to provide benefits to the wider economy as well as imposing costs, careful allocation of defence funding and effort mean that it has the potential to do more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defence industry’s role in the UK’s economy extends beyond pure macroeconomic metrics. This paper has attempted to provide a more granular perspective on the value of defence to the UK economy. Defence can contribute significantly to social stability and regional cohesion by providing meaningful employment and vocational training in areas where they are not always provided by commercial industry. This socioeconomic impact aligns with broader established government objectives, such as narrowing the gaps between the wealthiest and poorest areas, and efforts to strengthen the UK by ensuring that all regions benefit equitably from defence spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, UK forces must have the equipment that enables them to deter adversaries, and to prevail in conflicts, if necessary. But, to sustain the quality of their products, defence firms need continuity of work (as is well understood by other countries, including in the US, France and Germany). For projects of particularly high cost and risk, collaborative approaches with allied states are often available. For the immediate future, the MoD will be pressing for more funding, an option that it seems to believe is more likely to win public support if it can be seen to contribute to national prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence industrial spending is a major component of the UK’s economic landscape, particularly in terms of local and regional prosperity and industrial capability. It helps prevent the levelling down associated with de-industrialisation in traditional areas and supports higher-than-average wages and productivity. As the UK navigates its future defence and economic strategies, it must balance immediate fiscal prudence with the long-term benefits of a robust, strategically managed defence industrial base. This balance is crucial not only for national security but also for sustaining regional economies and, by extension, the socioeconomic fabric of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK defence spending currently benefits the economy and society through several of its attributes, from providing a national supply base, which brings well-paid jobs wherever it is located, to training many young people, especially in STEM-related areas. This is not the case across the wider economy. Defence spending is especially beneficial in coastal areas that are less prosperous than the country overall, but it is also beneficial in regions, such as the north of England, which have already experienced long-term damage from de-industrialisation. Large defence firms spread MoD revenues across extensive supply chains, including to many small firms. As defence-relevant technology increasingly interacts with rapid growth commercial technologies, defence spending can provide stimulus for dual-use innovations and a counter-cyclical source of revenue. Several countries are working to develop their own defence industries, and globally there is widespread appreciation for defence industrial employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government does not, and should not, spend defence money in the UK just to prop up disadvantaged regions. Nonetheless, the reality of 2025 is that assured defence capabilities look especially valuable. Russia has re-emerged as a hostile entity, and it seems the US can no longer be seen as a reliable ally to the UK. Moreover, there is little reason to think that defence spending at levels significantly higher than today would damage the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last 20 years of the Cold War, the UK government spent on average just under 5% of GDP per year on defence. Economic growth fluctuated significantly during this period, but the average was over 2% per year. In the last 20 years, defence has been just over 2% of GDP per year. Although growth rates during the same period fluctuated, the average annual growth has been just over 1.4%. If there has been a peace dividend, it has allowed governments to spend more on social welfare, health and education, which dominate government spending, but there is no obvious evidence that this helped economic growth. Overall, it appears that increasing defence spending in the UK would not necessarily be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arguments in this paper are broadly compatible with the policy stances of both the current government and its predecessors, dating from around 2015. However, policy implementation is usually more challenging than policy formulation. Defence industrial policy can only be implemented through acquisition choices, and these choices can be shaped by a range of stakeholders with different, more focused priorities than supporting the UK economy. While the next iteration of the UK Defence Industrial Strategy should be closely studied, much will rest on how it is put into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

With NATO-burden sharing under renewed scrutiny, European allies are being forced to reassess defence responsibilities ahead of the Alliance’s upcoming Hague Summit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European security is caught between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, Russian aggression against Ukraine and the broader Euro-Atlantic architecture shows no sign of halting. In fact, the threat continues to increase, as Russia has now mobilised for protracted conflict and continues to absorb losses in a way few European countries are ready to contemplate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the willingness of the US to support Ukraine unconditionally and to underwrite European security more broadly has clearly diminished. The Trump Administration expects the responsibility of defending NATO territory to be shouldered primarily by the European allies. This is largely the product of a problem of US overstretch across multiple theatres; a resource scarcity problem that is greatly exacerbated by the growing rapprochement between China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that this strategic problem for European security is increasingly well understood by different European capitals. Since the new NATO regional defence plans were approved at the Vilnius Summit in 2023, different analytical work strands have been trickling down into national defence establishments. As NATO approaches the upcoming summit in The Hague, the ever-green discussion about intra-alliance burden-sharing is intensifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this should not obscure the fact that the broad contours of a rebalanced alliance have already become apparent: European allies fast-track a conventional force build-up, the US continues to underpin extended nuclear deterrence and enable force integration across the conventional and nuclear domains, and all NATO allies together embrace the defence industrial expansion that is urgently needed. In turn, this allows the discussion to shift to some hard and technical hurdles, to be overcome by remembering the cohesion of the alliance remains a key hard-nosed interest for all parties concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;natos-conventional-force-build-up-gets-underway&quot;&gt;NATO’s Conventional Force Build-Up Gets Underway&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past years, NATO planners have designed an elaborate family of plans for deterring conflict with the Russian Federation and defending the North Atlantic area in case of Article 5 scenarios. These plans, which cut across different geo-spatial domains and geographical regions, can only be executed if the defence establishments of individual allies are sufficiently resourced so that the collective NATO force structure does not feature meaningful gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has become readily apparent is that European allies cannot continue to rely on the prospect of large-scale US reinforcements for plugging all such gaps in crisis. In addition, US strategic enablers – many of which are swing capabilities that underpin deterrence in different theatres – may not be permanently available due to the growing risk of simultaneous conflict elsewhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The force requirements that result from the regional plans approved in Vilnius have been integrated into the NATO defence planning process. When the Defence Ministers meet in June 2025, capability planning targets are set to be apportioned to all individual allies. Whilst it will require time and effort to build the forces in the numbers that are required – including providing for adequate training, munition stockpiling and infrastructure – the European allies now have a very granular understanding of what is required. As these plans are threat-based, the force requirements are sized and accounted for in function of possible Russian aggression, wherever it may appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the US contribution to NATO is limited in scale, the resulting gap will need to be picked up by the European allies. This means that the conventional force build-up is now set to accelerate in earnest, with different European capitals rapidly increasing their defence budgets to avoid becoming the weakest link in NATO’s collective defence. As a result, intra-European pressure to invest has become as intense as the transatlantic discussion about defence spending – if not more so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-case-for-nuclear-posture-adaptation&quot;&gt;The Case for Nuclear Posture Adaptation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russia’s war against Ukraine has been accompanied by persistent nuclear intimidation, it has become readily apparent that NATO must plan for any Article 5 contingency to unfold under a nuclear shadow. After all, the Russian playbook of shielding its consecutive landgrabs under a barrage of nuclear threats has now unfolded repeatedly – with partial success in terms of deterring external intervention and delaying assistance to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When NATO leaders met in Vilnius, they not only approved conventional defence plans but also instructed their military authorities to update planning to increase the flexibility and adaptability of the alliance’s nuclear forces. This would be done with a view to making sure that “NATO is ready and able to deter aggression and manage escalation risks in a crisis that has a nuclear dimension”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the increased uncertainty about the extent of US retrenchment from European security is fuelling debate about European alternatives to extended nuclear deterrence, strategic reality dictates that NATO’s nuclear deterrence remains the only viable option for countering Russian nuclear coercion, at least in the near to medium term future. Just like the conventional defence plans must be measured against the Russian conventional threat, nuclear deterrence arrangements protecting the territory of NATO allies must be measured against the Russian nuclear threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the latter is ominously large, immediate and highly diversified across strategic and sub-strategic delivery systems and warhead yields. Such a Russian posture that is built for threatening nuclear warfighting cannot be countered with the promise of a strategic-level nuclear response alone. It instead requires a combination of strategic nuclear forces as well as diversified non-strategic nuclear strike options that neither France nor the UK can generate by themselves. This is not to say that UK or French deterrence cannot step up in a way that increases NATO deterrence, to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything, the nuclear planning work that has been underway over the past two years is likely to indicate that NATO’s nuclear posture may need to evolve significantly to keep up with Vladimir Putin’s appetite for sabre-rattling. NATO’s nuclear deterrence relies on the strategic nuclear forces of France, the UK and the US as well as on forward-deployed US weapons and dual capable aircraft provided by other allies. The large disparity between NATO and the Russian Federation in terms of non-strategic systems suggests that NATO will need to bolster the theatre-level nuclear deterrence architecture. At the same time, NATO’s nuclear powers will need to consider whether their existing strategic nuclear forces suffice to deal with the two-nuclear-peer-environment that is emerging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France and the UK can envisage expanding their strategic arsenal as well as re-introducing non-strategic strike options to help offset the pressure on the US nuclear posture. In turn, the non-nuclear NATO allies would do well to facilitate the integration of planning across the nuclear and conventional domains, and to ensure the conventional support to nuclear operations remains adequate throughout what may be a protracted campaign. This pertains not just to the number of dual capable aircraft, but also to available tanker aircraft, ground and/or sea-based air defences, stand-off munition stockpiles, and the infrastructure that is required for all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;skyrocketing-defence-industrial-demand-is-challenging-supply-chains&quot;&gt;Skyrocketing Defence-Industrial Demand is Challenging Supply Chains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The force build-up that has got underway implies that European defence establishments are now expressing a skyrocketing demand signal to defence industry. This means production capacity must be scaled appropriately. Due to the gravity and the urgency of the strategic outlook, this will entail a mix between expanding co-production of systems that exist already (both in Europe and across the Atlantic) and designing new systems with more diversified and integrated supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this discussion is receiving ample attention in European capitals and EU institutions alike, the fact remains that truly European systems will emerge only to the extent that the diversification of industrial supply chains will make that vision a practical reality. In addition, several European states will be loath to choose between European-only and transatlantic defence industrial integration for the simple reason that a combination of the two is required for meeting the capability requirements that have been identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of whether the expansion of defence industrial production capacity unfolds in a purely European or in a transatlantic context, it requires a variety of technical hurdles to be overcome. When concluding security of supply agreements, trust is key, and this is easy to forfeit but hard to build. Yet beyond such questions of trust – responses to which can flipflop in function of political vagaries – lie deep-rooted structural issues. These pertain to supply chain bottlenecks concerning adequate access to raw materials, industrial workforce issues and various regulatory challenges. Addressing these effectively may well require decreasing the level of regulation and enabling swift procurement cycles to drive up production – even if this sometimes will raise thorny issues relating to export control regimes. It is arguably in these technocratic dimensions that EU-NATO cooperation can help deliver the mutually supporting ecosystem that the European defence establishments are craving for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-importance-of-nato-cohesion&quot;&gt;The Importance of NATO Cohesion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether one considers the ongoing build-up of European conventional forces, the debate about nuclear posture adaptation, and the defence-industrial implications of the still unfolding Zeitenwende together, one conclusion stands out. That is that European allies and the US will be in a much better position to overcome all possible hurdles by working together. The emergence of two monopolistic defence industrial blocs on both sides of the Atlantic, the questioning of extended nuclear deterrence, and the dissociation between nuclear and conventional deterrence and defence plans all constitute outcomes that would profoundly damage the alliance and the core national interests of all allies. As NATO capitals approach the summit agenda for the summit in The Hague, the importance of maintaining unity remains as paramount as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, India launched Operation Sindoor on 7 May. Initially limited to strikes on terrorist-linked targets, the operation expanded over several days, with subsequent phases coinciding with Pakistani retaliation. Within hours of the first sorties, international media had seized on Pakistani allegations that their Chinese-built J-10s shot down up to five Indian aircraft, including three French-made Rafaels. In the absence of official clarification from India, the episode was swiftly recast in popular outlets as a technology shootout between Chinese and French fighters. Lost in the noise were the questions that mattered: What were India’s objectives? Were they achieved? And what does this operation reveal about the future trajectory of South Asian deterrence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;losing-the-narrative&quot;&gt;Losing the Narrative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any military campaign, shaping the strategic narrative is nearly as important as shaping the battlespace. Unfortunately, India ceded that narrative space. The initial silence from Indian military spokespeople created an information vacuum. Into that vacuum poured commentary that was often technically uninformed and strategically misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What emerged was a distorted framing of the conflict. Rather than serious analysis of India’s targeting methodology, command intent, or escalation thresholds, coverage focused instead on the air-to-air engagement that led to the loss of Indian aircraft.Undue prominence was given to the performance of specific platforms, with little regard for the broader operational context or the rules of engagement that shaped the encounter. As a result, Chinese arms manufacturers enjoyed a perceived PR win – one arguably disproportionate to the tactical or strategic context of the engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-quiet-operational-success&quot;&gt;A Quiet Operational Success&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That misleading narrative obscures a more consequential truth: despite Pakistani tactical successes, India appears to have largely achieved its stated objectives. On the opening day of strikes, the Indian Air Force (IAF) demonstrated a credible capacity to identify and destroy what New Delhi characterised as terrorist-linked infrastructure in Pakistani territory, employing stand-off weapons to deliver precision strikes at speed. In the following days, operations expanded in scope, penetrating Pakistan’s Chinese-supplied air defence network to target select forward airbases for the first time since the 1971 war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While losses were incurred, these must be evaluated against the scale and complexity of the mission – not simply tallied in isolation. The mere fact that the Indian Air Force could strike targets under defended conditions and undertake follow-on attacks demonstrates its capacity for coercive precision operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;restraint-under-fire&quot;&gt;Restraint Under Fire&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably more impressive than the operation’s reach was its restraint on the first day. According to Indian officials, pilots operated under strict rules of engagement that prohibited initiating attacks on Pakistani aircraft or pre-emptively suppressing air defence systems. This decision – to accept heightened operational risk in order to confine the conflict strictly to terrorist-linked infrastructure – is telling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It suggests a political leadership determined to signal its intent with clarity: India was not interested in initiating a conflict with the Pakistani state, but rather in degrading a specific ecosystem of terrorist violence that exists in the country. That some Indian aircraft were lost on the opening day of the operation was a direct consequence of a consciously limited rules of engagement. In effect, India accepted heightened operational risk in pursuit of clear strategic messaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such discipline in the face of a capable adversary is neither automatic nor easy. Yet it may well have prevented a broader escalation spiral. That alone deserves more analytical attention than it has received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;escalation-managed&quot;&gt;Escalation, Managed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some reporting suggested that the region stood on the brink of nuclear war during Operation Sindoor. US President Donald Trump alleged that if the conflict had not ended when it did “…it could have been a bad nuclear war. Millions of people could have been killed.” These characterisations appear overstated in light of the facts on the ground. Unlike prior crises in South Asia, there were no public nuclear threats issued by either side, nor were there discernible moves toward strategic mobilisation. Rather than the brinkmanship so often invoked in academic literature on the subcontinent, what we saw instead was calibrated force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both New Delhi and Islamabad appeared to make deliberate choices about what not to do: India refrained from targeting Pakistani air defences or forward-deployed fighter aircraft in the early phases, while Pakistan retaliated against military targets but did not initiate large-scale mobilisation of its forces. The thresholds of escalation were tested, but not crossed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conflict illustrates that limited military engagement under the shadow of nuclear weapons can be contained – provided escalation thresholds are mutually understood, signalling remains disciplined, and objectives are narrowly defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some analysts have questioned how carefully escalation was managed during the conflict, the absence of nuclear signalling and the evident restraint by both sides suggests that this particular crisis was more contained than it first appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-new-normal&quot;&gt;The New Normal?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most significant legacy of Operation Sindoor is the precedent it sets. In the eyes of the Indian government, the use of cross-border force against terrorist-linked targets in Pakistan proper has now moved from exception to expectation. Whereas past crises often relied on signalling and symbolic action, future attacks on Indian soil – especially those traced to infrastructure across the border – are likely to draw a response of equal or greater magnitude to degrade the assets enabling terrorist action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of attempting to concretely link the terrorist incident to agents of the Pakistani state, the Indian government has taken the view that a failure to control or deny space to terrorist groups on Pakistani soil is sufficient to legitimate military action. Thus, India appears to have signalled a revised threshold for response, one that regional actors will have to factor into future risk assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;international-stakes&quot;&gt;International Stakes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temptation among some external observers will be to treat Operation Sindoor as a contained South Asian episode with little wider relevance. This is a mistake. With India’s new posture, so long as Pakistan’s territory continues to serve as permissive environments for transnational terrorist infrastructure, the risk of periodic crises will persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few examples better illustrate Pakistan’s long-standing role as a sanctuary for terrorist leadership than the discovery of Osama bin Laden in a compound just miles from the country’s premier military academy. Preventing the next Sindoor – or the next 26/11 – requires sustained international pressure to dismantle the networks that make these attacks possible in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sustaining-calibrated-deterrence&quot;&gt;Sustaining Calibrated Deterrence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Operation Sindoor demonstrated India’s ability to apply military power with restraint and precision, the durability of that approach will depend on how future crises are managed. India’s signal of intent to retaliate against cross-border terrorism marks a clear shift in posture. Yet deterrence by punishment carries inherent risks – chief among them the possibility that fringe actors may attempt to provoke confrontation in order to manipulate state responses. The continued viability of this approach may depend, in part, on the creation of complementary mechanisms for crisis management. Expanding communication channels – beyond existing National Security Advisor (NSA) and Director General of Military Operations (DGMO)–level contacts – could offer decision-makers greater flexibility to evaluate and contain emerging incidents. In a strategic environment shaped by tempo, perception, and public pressure, preserving space for discretion may be as vital as projecting resolve – particularly when domestic audiences may expect increasingly forceful responses in the wake of future provocations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally salient is the operational challenge of maintaining the effectiveness of coercive military action over time. As targeted groups adapt – dispersing their assets, improving their concealment techniques, and altering their operational rhythms – the demands placed on India’s intelligence and targeting apparatus will intensify. The strategic interaction may increasingly resemble an iterative contest of adaptation, in which each side seeks to outpace the other’s capacity for detection and response. In that sense, the long-term viability of calibrated retaliation may rest not only on its political logic, but on the practical capacity to identify and neutralize meaningful targets in an increasingly evasive operating environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operation Sindoor should be remembered not as a dogfight between airframes, nor as a stumble toward strategic instability. It was a calibrated use of force, intended to signal resolve, degrade terrorist infrastructure, and demonstrate capability – without crossing the line into broader war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so, it has redefined the contours of India’s response toolkit. What comes next will depend not only on India and Pakistan, but on whether the international community chooses to engage with the structures that give rise to such operations – or simply wait for the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of China and its growing assertiveness present both a challenge and an opportunity for the United States to strengthen its alliances and partnerships across Asia. While countries like Japan, South Korea, India, and the Philippines are increasingly alarmed by Chinese actions, U.S. efforts to coordinate with these allies are hindered by misaligned interests, weak institutions, occasionally overbearing American leadership, and China’s countercoercive strategies. Problems such as poor intelligence sharing, burdensome arms sales procedures, and limited multinational strategic planning hinder overall cooperation. The United States should institute a White House–led prioritization of China coordination, implement reforms to better respect allied political and economic needs, expand regional institutions like AUKUS and the Quad, and strengthen personal ties among defense and intelligence officials. Implementing these steps is essential to enhancing deterrence and warfighting capability in a rapidly shifting Indo-Pacific security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of China and Beijing’s aggressiveness have alarmed countries across Asia. This growing fear—seen in Australia, India, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and other states—represents an opportunity for the United States to solidify, and build on, its partnerships in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s advancements in its military capabilities, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, demand a coordinated response; no single nation can effectively manage this challenge alone. Indeed, close ties to allies and partners are a notable U.S. competitive advantage compared with China. These nations provide basing and access for U.S. forces, help deter aggressors, and ensure there is strong support in the face of Chinese economic coercion. They are often at the cutting edge of a range of defense-related innovations, such as directed energy weapons that use concentrated electromagnetic energy, rather than kinetic energy, to destroy targets, and advanced semiconductors. Should war break out, they would do much of the fighting—and the dying. Most U.S. operational plans include a major role for allies and partners, providing for basing, access, pre-positioning, logistics, and coalition operations. Protecting allied territory and populations would also be an important U.S. mission in many scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its competition with China, the United States needs to share intelligence, plan jointly, sell arms, and otherwise cooperate with a range of countries. Some of these, like Australia and Japan, are long-standing partners, but many other regional countries have not worked closely with the United States in the past. But even the United States’ closest allies face barriers that inhibit effective cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even when allies are rhetorically embraced, they are often treated as afterthoughts. Allies are not given timely and detailed intelligence against shared threats because of security concerns and cumbersome procedures. They are excluded from strategic planning even though their own roles are often central to U.S. plans. Allies are often encouraged to buy U.S. arms, but face barriers receiving advanced technologies and military equipment because of the cumbersome Foreign Military Sales (FMS) policy and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are potentially catastrophic. Allies may be less aware of threats because they lack access to U.S. intelligence, contribute less to military operations when excluded from planning processes, and face delays acquiring vital weapons systems and integrating U.S. technologies into their armed forces. They may question U.S. willingness to support them in a crisis and thus be more receptive to overtures from China. These problems may lead to redundancies—or worse, gaps—as allies pursue their own intelligence and military capabilities, and perhaps even seek their own nuclear capacity, separate from those of the United States. Some allies may even question whether they should risk standing up to Chinese aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor cooperation may also result in allies being surprised by or unprepared for a conflict, leading to higher casualties. They could be quickly overwhelmed because the United States did not help them prepare properly for various contingencies. The United States may need to deploy more of its own forces in response or otherwise step up its direct involvement even when allies would otherwise be willing and able to play a greater role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving coordination and bureaucratic problems is necessary, though rarely glamorous. However, any effort to contain or otherwise counter China requires using all available resources, including those of allies and partners, efficiently and cost effectively. Relatively small changes in the U.S. approach can unlock tremendous benefits in the contributions of allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief addresses three areas where the United States can strengthen its alliances and partnerships across Asia in peacetime in order to enhance deterrence against China and be better prepared for conflict: strategic planning, intelligence sharing, and arms sales. It draws heavily on (and at times takes text directly from) three other CSIS reports in this series on cooperation with allies and partners that examine ways to improve U.S. intelligence sharing, transform the Department of Defense’s multilateral strategic planning, and streamline U.S. arms sales. These earlier reports and thus this brief rely on interviews, discussions, and workshops with officials and experts; a literature review on the practice and theory of alliances; survey work of key partner states; and historical case studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper identifies four categories of challenges that hinder effective cooperation in any confrontation with China: competing interests and unclear priorities; weak institutions and cumbersome procedures; concerns about U.S. dominance; and potential Chinese countercoercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, however, is well positioned to manage these challenges. This can be achieved by prioritizing a White House–led effort focused on Asia, supporting Asian states in developing their own industrial bases and otherwise respecting their own political needs, improving regional institutions and expanding resources dedicated to cooperation with Asian allies, and bolstering personal ties whenever possible. Taken together, such steps will help solidify U.S. alliances and partnerships and, in so doing, enhance both deterrence and warfighting capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper first briefly lays out some of the challenges China poses to the United States and its allies. Second, it describes a range of problems and fears that inhibit strong partnerships in Asia. Third, it assesses how these problems might manifest in a confrontation with China. The paper concludes by offering recommendations for strengthening U.S. partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-china-challenge-a-brief-overview&quot;&gt;The China Challenge: A Brief Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China poses an array of threats to the United States and its allies. Beijing is making aggressive claims in both the East China Sea and the South China Sea, infringing on the sovereignty of Japan, the Philippines, and other countries. China has made the assimilation of Taiwan a top priority, building up its conventional military and nuclear forces and turning them into a potentially formidable foe. More broadly, Beijing is seeking to challenge U.S. global dominance and create a new international order centered on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of its effort to build military and economic power, China is methodically developing its defense industry. China’s arsenal grew by over 400 modern fighter aircraft and 20 major warships between 2021 and early 2024. China also more than doubled its ballistic and cruise missiles arsenal, developed a stealth bomber, and doubled the number of nuclear weapons it possesses. China is the world’s largest shipbuilder, with a military and commercial shipbuilding capacity that is roughly 230 times larger than that of the United States. In addition, China has become notably faster than the United States in acquiring weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to a strong industrial base, China is moving increasingly close to Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Although these relationships are not institutionalized like NATO, they have already proven formidable. Russia has sustained its war in Ukraine with massive economic assistance from China, Iranian drone systems, and North Korean troops. It is plausible, and indeed likely, that these countries might assist China in any confrontation it has with the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is engaged in a massive espionage campaign, seeking to penetrate the United States and allied governments. In 2023, the director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) warned that Australia faced “unprecedented” threats from Chinese intelligence. This danger requires U.S. allies to have robust security protocols, which many of them lack. Chinese intelligence penetration of the Philippines and Taiwan, for example, is considerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is thus seeking to advance on multiple fronts. In addition to using its growing military prowess to bolster its aggressive regional foreign policy, Beijing is also using alliances with other anti-U.S. countries and its intelligence services to advance its agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fears-and-problems-of-allies-and-partners&quot;&gt;Fears and Problems of Allies and Partners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the shared threat from China, U.S. cooperation with actual and potential allies and partners is uneven and fitful. Some reasons for this are inherent to any alliances, while others are due to U.S. policies and attitudes. The reasons can be grouped into four categories: competing interests and priorities; lack of institutionalization and cumbersome procedures; concerns about U.S. dominance and a lack of autonomy; and Beijing’s countercoercion. These issues are discussed in the context of intelligence sharing, multinational strategic planning, and arms sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-competing-interests-and-priorities&quot;&gt;1. Competing Interests and Priorities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies often have competing interests, hindering military planning and other forms of cooperation. One South Korean official noted fears in his country that Europe and the Middle East would distract the United States from threats in Asia. Allies, for their part, often have different priorities: North Korea, not China, is Seoul’s top concern. Even when there is agreement on the threat, there may be disagreement on the response. Some regional states that fear China believe that accommodation is necessary, while others favor a more confrontational approach. One official pointed out that many in South Korea, while not sympathetic to China, do not share the U.S. view that China is an adversary that must be confronted, preferring a more stable relationship. The Philippines, which seeks U.S. support in its own maritime disputes with China, at the same time is hesitant to back Taiwan in a crisis. Making this more difficult, many U.S. partners in Asia do not trust each other: U.S. efforts to bring South Korea and Japan together have had multiple setbacks due to their bitter history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So-called “chain gangs,” where allies drag their partners into a conflict, are another problem where different interests lead to inadvertent conflict. U.S. leaders have feared that a Taiwanese declaration of formal independence would generate a backlash in China, which would in turn lead Beijing to go to war and force the United States to come to Taiwan’s defense. Thus U.S. officials have tried to assure Taiwan of U.S. support in a conflict with China while trying to prevent it from acting unilaterally, claiming that in such a scenario the United States would not back Taiwan. If U.S. support is too unconditional, Taipei may believe it has a shield against Chinese aggression even in scenarios where it, rather than Beijing, is changing the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the United States worries about chain-gangs, so too do U.S. allies. NATO leaders have declared that they oppose any Chinese military efforts to control Taiwan, but European states have less concern about a China-Taiwan dispute than does the United States; as a result, they lack the extensive security relationships that the United States enjoys in Asia. Even a basic step such as NATO opening a liaison office in Japan was met with opposition within the alliance after Chinese concerns became clear. However, through NATO and other relationships, European states are tied to the United States, and it would be difficult for them to remain neutral in a U.S.-China conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mixed messages and unclear prioritization on the U.S. side have worsened these problems. Although the United States has emphasized Asia as its top area of security interest since the Obama administration, Europe, the Middle East, and (under the second Trump administration) Latin America have all competed for resources and senior-level attention. Part of this is due to the nature of the U.S. system, where multiple voices speak simultaneously on security and other issues. However, even within smaller communities there can be confusion, with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, combatant commands, and other entities within the U.S. defense establishment sending different signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, however, faces a dilemma: Increasing trust can, at times, lead allies and partners to do less, particularly when they have other priorities, such as emphasizing domestic spending over national security. A historic problem has been “buck-passing,” wherein allies free ride off their alliance with the United States or another power, not spending enough on their own militaries or otherwise not contributing their fair share. Although measures like military spending as a percentage of GDP are at best rough, it is clear that many at-risk Asian states are spending relatively little (often short of 2 percent) on their militaries. Many allies have failed to invest in basic capabilities, such as fuel storage and transport, as well as high-end systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-weak-institutions-and-cumbersome-procedures&quot;&gt;2. Weak Institutions and Cumbersome Procedures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong institutions can build trust, facilitate planning, reduce barriers to arms sales, promote interoperability, ease information sharing, and play many other important roles. Institutions create their own momentum, reinforcing habits of cooperation that in turn feed back into the sense of shared purpose and strategic alignment that birthed the institutions in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, no Asian NATO. The institutions that do exist are valuable, but they are more limited in their size, scope, and integration. Four existing arrangements merit discussion: the Five Eyes, the Quad, AUKUS, and the Military Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which grew out of the U.S.-UK World War II partnership, is often held up as the gold standard for intelligence sharing. The Five Eyes consists of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. As scholars have noted, the Five Eyes “is unique in the combination of its longevity, its resilience to changing global circumstances, and its ability to survive periodic tensions as well as maintain an ongoing similarity in the worldviews of its membership.” The countries involved share extensive intelligence related to foreign communications and methods of collection, as well as finished intelligence products. There is also some division of labor, with Australia monitoring South and East Asian communication while New Zealand covers the South Pacific and Southeast Asia. In recent years, cooperation has increased with regard to intelligence collection on China, with different members trying to expand their overall collection and coordinate regularly with others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Quad, composed of the United States, Australia, India, and Japan, focuses on high-level coordination on issues like maritime security and natural disasters, with little day-to-day integration. Although all members worry about an assertive China, India has been reluctant to go beyond general joint statements. In 2022, however, the Quad launched the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, which provides an opportunity for expanding institutionalization and organizational structures in maritime areas related to law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small but powerful alliance structure is AUKUS, a 2021 trilateral agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States to equip Australia with a conventionally armed, nuclear-powered attack submarine and enhance cooperation on advanced capabilities, including arms sales. This has included limited trilateral planning through the rotational presence of U.S. and UK submarines in Australia. The United States, United Kingdom, and Australia have also established the International Joint Requirements Oversight Council (I-JROC) as a forum for the vice chiefs of defense in the three countries to review joint and combined warfighting concepts as they develop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Military Framework is a U.S.-led forum of 14 countries that began with a focus on the Islamic State militant group. In recent years, however, it has expanded its scope to address strategic competition in both Europe and in Asia, with an eye toward improving planning and intelligence sharing. The Military Framework and the Five Eyes have members from Asia, but key countries such as South Korea are not included.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these institutions are valuable, but none include all of the key countries in the region that the United States would work with in a confrontation with China. Others do not involve detailed integration and planning or efforts to facilitate arms sales. The strongest—AUKUS and the Five Eyes—are particularly narrow in both their composition and function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the U.S. efforts with allies and partners in the region are bilateral. These include the U.S.-Philippines Salaknib exercises or the U.S.-Republic of Korea Freedom Shield exercises; bilateral wargaming such as the U.S.-Japan Integrated Air and Missile Defense Wargame; and various dialogues and working groups. There are also formal joint commands, such as that with South Korea. The United States has extensive, but uneven, bilateral intelligence sharing relationships with key countries in Asia beyond the Five Eyes, such as Japan and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States sets its own intelligence collection requirements, as do most allies; this can make resource issues more pronounced. Because collection is not coordinated, the United States often does not know what information allies—even Five Eyes countries—already have, thus reducing the economy of efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to insufficient military spending, allies and partners often have weaker counterintelligence capabilities than the United States, which inhibits sharing. Allies often lack Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) access and similar systems designed for sharing highly classified information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because institutions are weak, cooperation depends more on personal relationships. These types of relationships allow a margin for error: When things, inevitably, do not go as expected, interpersonal relationships allow for creative solutions and workarounds that the standard institutional processes cannot generate in a timely way. Relationships formed when sharing intelligence or making joint plans can pay off in numerous ways during a crisis and help overcome bureaucratic complexities. In many cases, however, U.S. officials deployed to non-English speaking countries do not know the local language and at times have limited background on the country’s history and strategic situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to weak institutions for coordination with partners, the U.S. system is bureaucratically complex and technically difficult to access, which inhibits bilateral cooperation. The United States also often defaults to NOFORN (Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals) classifications, hindering planning, intelligence sharing, and information about arms sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when institutionalization works, information sharing and coordination are often confined to military, intelligence, or other technocratic problems, with a lack of commensurate dialogue at the political level. This hinders broader strategic planning, as key actors are often not present. In addition, allies may receive different signals from military officers versus political leaders, making it harder for them to understand U.S. objectives and priorities. Indeed, the non-military side may be going in the wrong direction. A U.S. official responsible for security cooperation noted that the military is the front end working with partners, but civilians are the back end, and the latter do not have enough capacity to keep up with constant demands in Asia. The official pointed out that personnel cuts to the civilian workforce will harm military efforts at security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-concerns-about-us-dominance&quot;&gt;3. Concerns About U.S. Dominance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation with the United States creates autonomy issues for allies and partners. U.S. budgets and capabilities dwarf those of even wealthy allies like Japan, and thus partners can benefit tremendously from U.S. assistance. At the same time, however, specialization of partners to avoid duplication or reliance on U.S. intelligence, logistics, or other capabilities leaves partners vulnerable if the United States sees its interests differently during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States at times worsens this problem with its tendency toward unilateralism. During Desert Shield, an important U.S. operational plan (OPLAN 1002-90) did not account for Saudi logistics capacity, which led to the overallocation of U.S. logistics assets to Saudi Arabia and the ad hoc incorporation of Saudi logistics capacities by local-level leaders. In the end, this error meant little due to the enormous coalition military advantage over Iraq, but a war with China would depend heavily on effective logistics, and similar errors could be disastrous. In Afghanistan, the United States took greater control over planning as the insurgency worsened in order to improve overall speed. Plans, however, were often implemented before NATO validation, and the contributions of U.S. allies were often more limited as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allies see multinational planning as initiated, led, and dominated by the United States, and this is difficult when allies have their own interests and views of how to fight a conflict. One former U.S. official noted that the United States often believes it understands the interests of allies better than they themselves do—even as U.S. policies and priorities regularly flip-flop. U.S. stances are, or can be perceived as, arrogant and uninformed at times: A “daddy knows best” approach, as the official described it. In arms sales, U.S. procedures are designed to reduce U.S. purchases from allies and partners, leading to resentment when the United States pushes allies to purchase U.S. systems. In general, building domestic industry capacity is a top goal of allies, which they see as vital economically and also a way to bolster deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nationalism and local politics often complicate other countries’ relationships with the United States, making open coalition planning and formal alliances more difficult. In general, states do not like to openly rely on other states for their security, as it implies government weakness. In addition, world opinion of the United States varies considerably by country and historical period, often creating pressure on governments to publicly distance themselves from Washington. In some important countries relevant to potential China-related contingencies, such as Vietnam and the Philippines, the United States has a history of conflict, generating additional suspicions. When the United States acts without consulting allies, the political consequences can be considerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-countercoercion&quot;&gt;4. Countercoercion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because allies are often weaker and closer to potential aggressors, the cost of betting on the wrong horse is higher. As one foreign official noted, “Allies have less room to say ‘oops’.” This is a problem for allies in Asia, where China is near and the United States is far away. Thus, they are highly vulnerable to Chinese military and gray zone pressure, particularly if the United States is not there to back them up. Sam Roggeveen, a former Australian intelligence analyst, notes that greater U.S. military ties to Australia—including the construction of air bases in the country that host U.S. forces—“conflates America’s strategic objectives in Asia with ours, and it makes those bases a target.” Similarly, a South Korean official noted, “Being on the side of the United States is not cost free,” adding that “South Korea cannot wish away geography.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is also an important trading partner for allies in Asia, and it weaponizes these economic relations when its political positions are challenged, imposing selective boycotts on imports from the offending country or otherwise imposing restrictions. This threat has shaped the behavior of even close U.S. allies. New Zealand, for example, has feared alienating China, and thus its intelligence partners have at times been reluctant to cooperate with it. As one expert put it, “the Kiwis are reluctant to say ‘boo’ to China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. allies and partners worry that the United States will not honor its promises to them, making them more sensitive to the risks involved in crossing China. This concern has grown in the Trump administration, as the United States has criticized many long-standing allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-these-problems-inhibit-cooperation-against-china&quot;&gt;How These Problems Inhibit Cooperation Against China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a confrontation with China, problems related to intelligence sharing, strategic planning, and arms sales could prove catastrophic. These would hinder deterrence, making a conflict more likely; undermine responses to Chinese coercion before and during a crisis; and hinder the U.S. and partner response should a shooting war with China break out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems may begin with different threat perceptions. Some valuable information may fail to reach allies. One Japanese intelligence official noted that they rarely see U.S. information in their day-to-day work. This, in turn, affects threat perceptions and attitudes toward the United States. Allies may prove slower to recognize aggression from Beijing in the absence of salient U.S. intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lack of trust occurring due to different interests and a limited and slow supply of critical weapons systems may inhibit allied confidence in U.S. security guarantees. This in turn may weaken deterrence and create incentives for nuclear proliferation. Allies may be more willing to bandwagon with a potential aggressor if they are unsure that the United States will back them or if they believe close ties to the United States will “chain gang” them into an unwanted war. Some partners and allies might turn to China or other providers for weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such circumstances, it is far easier for Chinese countercoercion to function. Allies and partners will fear that they are too weak or that the United States will not back them—or both—and they will not have a coordinated response to Beijing’s military and economic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing may believe that poorly armed and trained U.S. allies create an offense-dominant environment in which a fast strike would succeed while a more prolonged conflict would fail, as the United States would then step up its support. China may also believe that allies with poorly armed militaries and weak defense industrial bases will be easy pickings. This perception is especially likely if they believe that the victim state has weak intelligence and could be caught by surprise. Chinese leaders may also reason that differing U.S. and allied interests will allow them to find cracks in any alliance, posing challenges in areas where one party has less of an interest, such as China staking a claim to tiny, unpopulated islands in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation is likely to suffer both before and during a crisis. Military operations depend on a wide range of tactical information, and, as one allied official put it, “Bad intelligence means bad plans.” Allied military forces may have suboptimal postures, fail to be prepared for a confrontation, or lack personal relations that can facilitate cooperation during a crisis. As one official put it, key figures may be exchanging business cards as they meet for the first time rather than rolling up their sleeves to work. Interoperability at all levels would pose tremendous challenges. This would include allies and partners having weapons systems from non-U.S., perhaps even Chinese, manufacturers, but also unfamiliarity due to insufficient preparedness, limited training, and coalition-wide military exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a conflict, a lack of effective coalition planning may lead the United States to wrongly assume that allies will take on roles for which they are unprepared or unwilling, while conversely allies may wrongly assume that the United States will manage difficult aspects of a conflict, such as air supremacy or strategic lift, without fully understanding U.S. limits. Allies that are poorly trained and lack access to high-end military systems will be less able to counter air supremacy, deny sea lanes to adversary shipping, prevent cyberattacks, or otherwise act on their own. This increases the risk that the United States would enter a shooting war from a position of weakness and that, during a conflict, it would not be able to take full advantage of allied and partner capabilities and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve cooperation with allies against China, the United States should consider four steps: improving prioritization; respecting allied politics; strengthening Asia-focused institutions; and bolstering personal ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-prioritize-coordination-on-challenges-related-to-china&quot;&gt;1. Prioritize Coordination on Challenges Related to China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government, in the best of times, involves a welter of competing bureaucracies with different missions and concerns, which in turn make different and competing demands on allies and partners. When the United States prioritizes a concern, as the Biden administration did after the 2022 full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the resulting chaos can be overcome, but this is the exception, not the rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high-level working group on China, run out of the White House, should coordinate planning, arms sales, intelligence sharing, and other requests from China-facing allies to ensure they are given top priority. Examples would include ensuring that intelligence-sharing procedures are streamlined for key countries in Asia and that ITAR; Technology, Security, and Foreign Disclosure (TSFD); and FMS processes do not hinder arms sales. Coordination would also ensure that U.S. guidance to allies and partners is clear and does not conflict at different bureaucratic levels. Working with Congress to reduce the number of Congressional authorizations for sales that are not strategically sensitive and do not involve the most sophisticated systems could speed up the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritization should then occur when U.S. officials engage allies in bilateral and multilateral forums in Asia. This will be a back-and-forth, with the United States adjusting its priorities in response to allied concerns as well as encouraging allies to embrace U.S. priorities. In the end, U.S. priorities will not be achieved without allied assistance, so accommodating their concerns is vital for ultimate U.S. success. Ideally, this would be bipartisan, as allied and partner cooperation will span administrations and suffers when U.S. priorities oscillate. Intelligence sharing also plays a role here. One former allied official noted that U.S. assessments shaped their own country’s worldview in dozens of small ways that, over time, brought the two countries into greater alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-respect-allied-politics-and-economics&quot;&gt;2. Respect Allied Politics and Economics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as arms sales and other forms of cooperation bolster the U.S. economy, so too can military cooperation help allies’ economies and their willingness to work with the United States. In particular, a “build allied” approach allows the United States to better achieve important goals, such as more rapid shipbuilding, while benefiting allied economies, making cooperation much easier for them politically and giving them a vested interest that will transcend various administrations. Collaborative ventures can be particularly valuable, increasing economies of scale and enabling the United States to profit from allied arms sales and vice versa. However, the U.S. bureaucratic incentives all go in the other direction. As one interviewee noted, “no one gets fired for buying American.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, Washington must recognize that the unpopularity of the United States and allied concerns for autonomy may at times make cooperation difficult. Improving cooperation often requires behind-the-scenes engagement rather than open pressure, accepting that allies will differ with the United States, at times publicly, and letting allies take the lead in visible ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-strengthen-institutional-ties-and-expand-the-circle&quot;&gt;3. Strengthen Institutional Ties and Expand the Circle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. alliances and partnerships in Asia may never mirror those in Europe, but they can be strengthened. Expanded, AUKUS-like arrangements with Japan and South Korea would be highly valuable, and the Philippines should also receive extra attention. Outside AUKUS, the United States could consider coordinating arms sales and FMS cases for countries like Japan and South Korea to speed up the process so both can advance together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Quad is among the weaker of the existing institutions in Asia, there is hope for invigorating it. President Donald Trump’s good relations with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the recent commitment to deepen the U.S.-India defense relationship, could be used to address India’s concerns and improve alignment over the Quad’s role and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should also begin the long process of expanding and institutionalizing intelligence cooperation with key Asian allies outside the Five Eyes. This will involve technological upgrades on the allies and partner side and procedural changes on the U.S. side to reduce the automatic default to NOFORN. In addition, the United States will need to start with more limited sharing and build from there as allies and partners improve their counterintelligence and, over time, harmonize their collection efforts with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. systems are complex for partners and allies to navigate, and they are made worse when the United States lacks the personnel to ensure prompt responses. More liaison officers for joint planning and intelligence sharing are necessary, as is more training for both U.S. and allied officials on the complexities of U.S. procedures, so their requests can avoid common pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-build-stronger-personal-connections&quot;&gt;4. Build Stronger Personal Connections&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multinational efforts can also improve personal connections and, in so doing, build trust that is invaluable during a crisis. In addition, these connections are vital for work-arounds when institutional cooperation is slow or otherwise insufficient. As the Military Framework’s official history notes, “The most precious ‘product’ of the framework is neither tangible nor measurable. It is instead something elusive and sublime: trust.” Expanding the circle for institutions will strengthen personal connections, as will increasing personnel. A particular effort should be made to increase the number of speakers of Asian languages who work with allies and to ensure that rotations and assignments to Asia help build long-term expertise and personal connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-benefits-of-greater-cooperation&quot;&gt;The Benefits of Greater Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These recommendations, taken together, can improve planning, make partner militaries stronger, and bolster sharing in general. With common or compatible systems, procedures, and communication protocols, allied forces can coordinate actions more efficiently, respond faster to emerging threats, and achieve objectives with greater precision. Intelligence relationships can also bolster overall diplomacy and alliance strength. By sharing capabilities, resources, and information, interoperability leads to more efficient use of military assets and more coordinated responses. Demonstrating military interoperability also sends a clear message about the solidity of alliances and the collective commitment to maintaining international security and order. Integrated command and control systems enable allied forces to deploy and operate together effectively on short notice, helping allies to leverage each other’s strengths and compensate for individual limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with allies and partners can be frustrating and is always time-consuming. The results are invariably incomplete, and the benefits difficult to measure in peacetime. Strong alliances, however, are the bedrock of deterrence and warfighting: They can help the United States avoid a war with China through effective deterrence and, should deterrence fail, enable the United States to triumph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US defence policy and planning will increasingly focus on preparing for possible military conflict with China. The trade war between the two could accelerate tensions and planning on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy will be more transactional, requiring allies and partners to assume greater responsibility for defending their countries and regions, underwriting the costs of US bases and activities, and expecting them to continue to buy US equipment in large volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, there will be attempts to refocus US defence towards better securing and defending the US homeland. The DoD will need to square the circle between the trillion-dollar defence budget Trump has mooted and the cost-cutting exercises in train. Key areas for investment will include accelerating force modernisation and missile defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these strands could overlap or combine this Summer: at the NATO Summit in June, in the event of a ceasefire in Ukraine (or major falling-out between the US and Russia) and in case of major Israeli strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new National Defence Strategy is due to be completed by the end of August. We should expect a short, punchy document setting out principles, tasks and priorities rather than a detailed blueprint for future US force structure and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-approach&quot;&gt;Policy Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first 100 days of the President Trump’s second presidency, his economic policy approach and foreign policy priorities became clearer, with the contours of his defence policy now firming up to become increasingly consequential as the year progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the “America First” principle, key themes of US defence policy include: stopping current wars and preventing new ones; restoring US military strength and rebuilding the US defence industrial base; requiring allies and partners to pay more for their own defence and their regions’ security; strengthening US borders and stepping up protection against potential missile attacks on the US; and rebalancing US capability planning and force posture to prepare for a future conflict with China – as “the pacing threat”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Washington post reported in March the headlines of a secret internal planning document, the Interim National Defence Strategic Guidance, which provides a prioritisation framework for officials to turn these defence policy themes into plans, activities and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment in the executive summary above assumes a relatively orderly approach to implementation of this policy approach. Trump’s approach to foreign policy, tariffs and trade show that he is prepared to take significant risks. It remains to be seen whether his approach to defence will remain within the contours that have emerged so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of May, Defence Secretary Hegseth issued a memorandum directing the development of a new National Defence Strategy to help deliver Trump’s twin imperatives of putting “America First” and delivering “Peace Through Strength”. It is due to be completed by the end of August, with an unclassified version probably available in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-of-military-force&quot;&gt;Use of Military Force&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tump authorised the first military action of this administration, against the Houthis in Yemen, in March. US-led attacks increased in scale over several weeks. On 6th May Trump announced that the Houthis had agreed to stop attacks against international shipping in the Red Sea, and in response he was suspending attacks against Houthi targets in Yemen. The Houthis have subsequently said that attacks against Israel will continue. There is speculation that this “truce” will end after Trump’s tour to the Gulf this week concludes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand Trump’s attitude to the military instrument requires looking back to his first term. In 2017, Trump inherited a major coalition campaign already underway against ISIS, but US operations against the organisation intensified and culminated under his leadership. He eventually presided over its final territorial defeat in Syria in 2019 (and, with some fanfare the special forces operation which led to the death of its leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi). The coalition later assessed at least 80,000 ISIS casualties during operations against the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publicly hostile to long-term military commitments, beyond the Counter-ISIS campaign, Trump authorised relatively few military operations in his first term – but those he did sign-off were significant (notably strikes against Bashar Al-Assad’s Syria after use of chemical weapons and the targeted killing of IRGC Quds Force Commander Qassem Soleimani).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite his own personal interest in being perceived as a peacemaker, he could be prepared to resort to the military instrument more regularly – and potentially at scale – during his second term if he judges that circumstances require such responses. As well as the operations against the Houthis, the US bombed targets in Somalia, Iraq and Syria in the past three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump will want to avoid the military entanglements and longer-term commitments of which he has been so dismissive. So, he will prefer the precise and occasional use of naval and air power – and particularly stand-off missile strikes – to the use of land forces wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The build-up of US forces in the Middle East now underway would provide the capability to undertake a range of operations if circumstances required. The US is actively discouraging Israel from any attack against Iran’s nuclear programme this summer and is investing heavily in diplomacy designed to reach a new nuclear deal with Iran. But in the event that Israel ignores this counsel and mounts independent large-scale attacks against Iran, and Iran retaliates at scale, it seems likely that the US would be drawn into the conflict. Any such conflict could well be protracted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Middle East, the US has been clear that it will not provide a “backstop” security guarantee for Ukraine or support for a European assurance force in the event of a ceasefire or peace deal there. More broadly, the US commitment to the NATO Article V guarantee seems weaker than at any time since it was agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closer to the US, DoD planners have been asked to draw up options to increase the US troop presence in Panama. Defence Secretary Hegseth visited last month and has spoken of “reviving” US military bases there. Further covert US military action against the cartels in Mexico and Venezuela seems possible – surveillance operations over Mexico are being stepped-up and the US military is taking control of land along the US-military border. Ecuador’s president said recently that he would welcome US military assistance in his “war” against the cartels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct US military action against Greenland seems unlikely, but it would not be surprising to see the US military presence at its space base there being increased, perhaps quite substantially. That would enable the US to declare effective military control over Greenland if circumstances required it – in US eyes. A US military attack against Canada seems inconceivable; continuing economic coercion seems highly likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither the US nor China want to go to war over Taiwan. But both are actively preparing for major operations in that area. The risks are increasing sharply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-people&quot;&gt;The People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with other areas, major US defence policy decisions will continue to be made by Trump and his immediate inner circle. But Trump has no background in defence, the DoD is a huge, complex bureaucracy and defence planning is a long-term business. So, the top team in the Pentagon should have increasing influence as Trump’s second term progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Defence Secretary Hegseth and his deputy, Stephen Feinberg, have little relevant defence experience (Hegseth’s position is also in doubt after his own role in the “Signal” controversy, as well as firing several of his own personal advisers). On the military side, having removed Charles Brown as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Trump has replaced him with a retired 3-star Air Force officer, Dan Caine, who has now been confirmed by the Senate. He has also removed a string of other senior military personnel and national security staff. There are concerns that, after public disagreements with a series of strong-minded Defence Secretaries and Chairmen during his first term, Trump is appointing figures who will demonstrate the personal loyalty he prizes – and be less likely to obstruct his plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major contours of US defence policy are instead likely to be set by Elbridge Colby, who was confirmed by the Senate last month as Under Secretary for Defence Policy. He is a China hawk and critic of European defence spending. He will reinforce arguments for re-setting US defence policy, posture and planning towards preparing for a conflict with China. He will argue for withdrawing some US forces from Europe and spoke last week about the need for the Europeans to assume much greater responsibility for and focus more directly on security in this region. He supports AUKUS in principle but has suggested that the US will need to re-think its commitment to providing Virginia-class submarines to Australia in advance of building up the US attack submarine fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colby will author the new US National Defence Strategy. The strategy he produced in 2018 was well regarded, including for its qualities of brevity and clarity. We should expect another short, punchy document setting out principles, tasks and priorities for US defence rather than a detailed blueprint for future US force structure and capabilities. The prospectus he spoke to at Policy Exchange last summer and during his Senate confirmation hearing will likely be reflected in this new strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above the Pentagon, four figures other than Trump will be particularly influential. Vice President Vance’s position on European security and disdain for allies is very clear. On defence matters, we should expect him to be aligned with the positions Colby is advocating. Analysts in the defence community hold that Stephen Miller, Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy sees major reductions in the defence budget as possible, and that Russell Vought, the director of the Office for Management and Budget, shares his view. Elon Musk’s views are starker still, although he now seems to be losing ground and influence as he steps back from his role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Nonetheless, we expect the cost-cutting and efficiency initiatives he set in motion will continue to influence federal agencies, including DoD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quartet is likely to be influential and hands-on in the approach Trump takes to driving through plans to re-set military commitments overseas and reform US defence at home. It remains to be seen whether Marco Rubio or whoever succeeds him as NSA chooses to play a major role in setting defence policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;re-setting-us-defence-overseas&quot;&gt;Re-setting US Defence Overseas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European theatre will be an early test-case for how the US intends to re-set its overseas commitments. A set of steps/measures could include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Withdrawing progressively up to a third of current US combat forces from Europe, mainly from Germany, potentially some from UK, Poland, Italy and Spain, and rotational forces from the Baltics and Romania.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Progressively withdrawing key capabilities and enablers, particularly command and control capabilities, air defence, armour and artillery, deep strike capabilities, air and space-based ISR, AAR and transport aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Explicitly linking a US commitment to Article V only to those allies that satisfy certain conditions, including levels of defence spending.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More radically, and less formally, the US nuclear guarantee could be diluted by equivocation about using US nuclear weapons in the defence of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some capabilities and enablers would be redeployed to the Asia-Pacific theatre, others would return to the US. More importantly, US contingency planning seems likely to quite significantly adjust downwards assumptions about the scale of reinforcements the US would be prepared to deploy to Europe in the event of a major crisis there. In the scenario above, the US would continue to sell platforms, weapons and other systems to European nations (insofar as they wish to buy them in future) and provide effective support to in-service capabilities and systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secretary of State (now also NSA) Rubio offered European members of NATO reassurances in Brussels at the start of April that the US would re-set its approach to European security in a measured way. And some US figures, including outgoing SACEUR, General Cavoli, are stressing that a strong US presence in Europe contributes to US national security by defending the US homeland forward, allowing the US to project combat power globally, and deterring Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But from Trump down, senior US figures are united behind the demand the European members of NATO should spend 5% of their GDP on defence and take greater responsibility for the defence of Europe. Most will regard this target as an unrealistic negotiating ploy. NATO Secretary General Rutte is working to find creative ways to bridge this gap. These issues could well come to a head at the NATO Summit in the Hague between 24-26 June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There would be a major gap to fill in the second half of this decade as and when the US enacts the changes set out above – or goes further. Major European defence players are reportedly drawing up plans to take on greater responsibilities for the continent’s defence, on the basis of a managed transfer over the next 5-10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the current US military build-up in the Middle East region and the growing possibility of a major crisis there this year, we do not expect the US to make any significant adjustments to the current US basing-arrangements in the region until after this tension has subsided – or the crisis has played itself out (though the US military presence in Syria is being trimmed). Thereafter, the US is likely to continue to adopt a mercantile approach to US military presence in the region, maintaining bases and forces in countries who pay for those bases and buy significant amounts of US military equipment. Trump will be well satisfied with the major financial commitments he received from leaders in the Gulf this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reforming-us-defence&quot;&gt;Reforming US Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture on reforming US defence at home is less clear. Some announcements have been contradictory. One of Hegseth’s first moves was to announce that he would significantly re-balance US defence towards Trump’s new national security priorities, and remove 8% of the budget, circa $50 billion, allocated to non-core activities over the next five years. A major set of programmes that would be exempted from these measures, including the nuclear programme, Virginia-class submarines, uncrewed systems and the Air Force’s emerging uncrewed fighter jet program, surface ships, cybersecurity, munitions and homeland missile defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together this list of programmes accounts for the vast majority of the DoD’s equipment spend. It follows that, in order to deliver these reductions, the DoD would need to take an aggressive approach to delivering the core programmes more cost-efficiently, cutting back non-core programmes and reducing the costs of the civilian and contractor workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two constituencies will potentially stand in the way of this approach. The defence-industrial complex in the US has adapted slowly over the past several decades, despite the reformist zeal shown by more effective teams than the new management in the Pentagon. And Congress has always played a significant role in the oversight of defence policy, plans and particularly the defence budget. Senior Republicans might yet find their voices on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of last month, Trump spoke of increasing the US defence budget to $1 trillion (up from circa $890 billion this US financial year). Neither the DoD nor White House has provided any detail on how this uplift would be spent. The “Golden Dome” missile defence system Trump has spoken of could absorb a significant element, as would widespread force modernisation. The defence budget request for the year ahead is expected in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the picture on US defence should be clearer by the end of the summer, when several of the issues described above will have developed or played-out.&lt;/p&gt;
