&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite successes in its nuclear and missile programmes over the past few years, North Korea still relies on external sources of technology to supply its weapons programmes and will continue to do so in the long term. Procurement networks with tentacles all around the world have been used by the country to obtain technology from willing exporters and naive businesses, and to dupe those trying to comply with export controls over the past decades. These networks will continue to be key to the sustainment of North Korea’s programmes and further technological progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper analyses North Korea’s procurement networks, particularly in view of North Korea’s programmatic successes and recent geopolitical shifts in Russia’s relationship with North Korea as a result of the war in Ukraine. The paper draws on underexploited source material to offer an overview of North Korea’s procurement networks over the past five years. It finds that North Korea’s networks are active and will remain so, and are likely seeking to make up for the slowdown in procurement during the period of Covid-19-related border closures, and to fulfil recent Russian orders for missile technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The networks are largely focused in China and Russia, where North Korean operatives – trading company personnel, diplomats, intelligence officers, and scientists and researchers – have been able to operate largely unhindered, allowing them to establish supply chains. However, there are still some needs that see North Korea looking to manufacturers in the US, Europe, Japan and other markets to fulfil. North Korea’s renewed relationship with Russia is perhaps the most important factor that will shape the future of the country’s procurement networks. Any formal offer of strategic technologies by Moscow to Pyongyang, or actions that see North Korean operatives openly purchase on a larger scale from Russian providers, would be bountiful for North Korea’s procurement needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other factors will also shape the nature of North Korea’s procurement networks into the future, including evolving needs and greater requirements for highly specialised technologies provided by a smaller number of niche suppliers. Overall, the paper concludes that despite North Korea’s successes, seeking to prevent the country’s access to, and procurement of, technology is still valuable. It makes 10 recommendations to those seeking to counter North Korea’s illicit procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite successes in its nuclear and missile programmes over the past few years, North Korea still relies on external sources of technology to supply its weapons programmes. Long subject to extensive UN sanctions prohibiting exports of many of these technologies to North Korea, Pyongyang has made extensive use of illicit procurement networks to access these technologies. These networks, with tentacles all around the world, obtain the goods from a mix of willing exporters and naive businesses, and by duping those trying to comply with export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These external technologies – from materials and components, to machine tools and other manufacturing equipment, to sensitive design information and expertise – have allowed North Korea to advance its nuclear and missile programmes. The goods, manufacturing technologies and expertise, along with extensive domestic investment, have allowed North Korea to build up its indigenous WMD-related expertise and industrial base. This has led to the apparent growth of the country’s nuclear arsenal, which – while public estimates are scant – has been said by US intelligence sources to number up to 60 warheads. North Korea has also successfully developed ICBMs and systems with shorter ranges, seemingly of domestic design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reassessment of North Korea’s procurement of foreign technology is timely. In the medium to long term, North Korea will continue to rely on imported technologies and its procurement networks as its nuclear and missile arsenals develop. Recent geopolitical developments have also worked to open up North Korea’s opportunities to benefit from external sources of technology. After North Korea’s renewal of its relationship with Russia, rumours emerged that Moscow will offer strategic technologies to Pyongyang in return for arms transfers for use in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s flagrant violation of the UN arms embargo, as well as China dragging its feet over sanctions, has put the UN sanctions regime on life support. These states, both with extensive strategic industries, have been significant targets for North Korea’s technology procurement efforts. China is also the main transhipment hub for goods en route to North Korea. However, despite the potential impending disintegration of the UN sanctions regime, seeking to implement supply-side controls and continuing to counter North Korea’s illicit procurement is still valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides Russia and China, many states with companies that produce technology of value to North Korea’s procurement – particularly the US, Europe and Japan – remain on board with sanctions on North Korea. There are also many other states that have sought and will continue to seek to prevent technology leaking out to North Korea’s programme. States seeking to counter North Korea’s procurement will also continue to make the case for sanctions implementation to a range of states that can and will occasionally act as transhipment or re-export hubs for nuclear- and missile-related technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this continued role for UN sanctions and the need to make the case to partners, an up-to-date examination of North Korea’s WMD-related procurement efforts is a timely and important aid to sanctions implementation. Analysis is also pertinent given the expiry of the mandate of the UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1718 Committee Panel of Experts (PoE) in April 2024. The dissolution of the PoE represents a blow to sanctions monitoring and implementation. This paper offers a baseline analysis for further outreach on sanctions implementation to counter North Korea’s illicit procurement. It is hoped this is especially useful for governments, their intelligence and customs bodies, and the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;data-challenges-and-existing-research&quot;&gt;Data Challenges and Existing Research&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there has been some focused research on North Korea’s nuclear and missile procurement activities, no recent works have considered them in detail. The limited work in this area is largely due to the challenges of access to data, with much of North Korea’s programmes completely hidden from view. Studies of North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes have tended to provide broader overviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically on the nuclear side, lack of access to North Korean facilities – and, indeed, as key elements of North Korea’s uranium enrichment programme are unknown to outsiders – means that little is understood about the scope of North Korea’s programmes and the technologies that are used. There is more information in the public domain on the missile programme, with images and footage of increasingly frequent missile tests, parades and factory visits published by the regime, as well as missile test wreckage fished off the bed of the sea, or more recently from impact sites in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discerning the balance of North Korea’s import of technology from overseas, either by overt assistance or illicit procurement, and its domestic industrial capacity, has been a particular challenge. For the nuclear programme, on top of the lack of insights into North Korean facilities, there have been few cases of seizure of goods destined for the programme, providing little insight into foreign dependencies. There is more, albeit limited, data on the missile programme that can be used to analyse North Korea’s successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While limited in number, there are some more focused works on North Korea’s procurement networks. Some analysis has considered the procurement of specific technologies, while others have focused on the role of certain types of entities in North Korea’s procurement and arms trading activities. Still others have looked at North Korea’s knowledge networks and the procurement of “intangible” technology – the design information, sensitive data and knowledge that accompanies tangible goods, components and systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these more focused works are based on information from almost a decade ago, with North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes having since progressed significantly. Taking stock of the situation as much as is possible through an up-to-date and more holistic treatment will help frame future efforts to counter the country’s procurement networks. This is particularly necessary in view of the dissolution of the UN PoE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-hypothesis-and-structure&quot;&gt;Methodology, Hypothesis and Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper seeks to provide an up-to-date analysis of North Korea’s illicit procurement – the technologies it is seeking, its procurement apparatus and modus operandi – focusing on the period since the last UN North Korea sanctions resolution was passed in 2017. The paper uses a range of newer sources that have so far had limited consideration. The more recent reports of the now defunct PoE have included details on procurement efforts, including several detailed cases since 2017. US designations from as recently as 2023 and detailed guidance on countering North Korea’s illicit procurement for its missile programme from 2020 also offer new insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wreckage of North Korean missiles recovered from the battlefields of Ukraine also offers new perspectives on the contents of North Korean weapons. In addition, the paper fills in some gaps in the history of North Korea’s procurement from recent UK National Archives finds from the 1980s and early 1990s. The data from these under-used sources is combined with insights from several interviews with nuclear and missile proliferation experts, cited anonymously due to the sensitivity of the subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper argues that in the medium to long term, North Korea will continue to rely on imported technology and its procurement networks as its nuclear and missile arsenals develop. Since 2017, these procurement networks have been active in a range of areas, and particularly in dual-use technologies (those with both military and civilian applications). The paper shows that these networks will continue to be active as they make up for the slowdown in procurement during the period of Covid-19-related border closures, and as they work to procure technology for domestic uses, as well as to compensate for the goods used in producing missiles exported to the new Russian market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper contends that North Korea’s procurement networks are largely focused on China and Russia. In these jurisdictions, North Korea’s agents operate with little risk of reprisal, and have been able to establish supply chains for a growing number of requisite technologies. However, North Korea still has needs or interests that result in Pyongyang looking to manufacturers in the US, Europe, Japan and other markets through intermediaries, as is demonstrated by the electronic components inside North Korean missile wreckage recovered from Ukraine. Desire for certain quality products, or a preference for goods from these countries, could ensure continued interest in these markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pyongyang’s renewed relationship with Moscow is perhaps the most important factor that will shape the future of North Korea’s procurement networks. North Korea has supplied arms and ballistic missiles for use in Ukraine, and Pyongyang and Moscow signed a mutual defence treaty in June 2024. If Moscow were to formally offer strategic technologies to Pyongyang, or to allow North Korea’s procurement operatives to openly shop on a larger scale from Russian providers, this could be bountiful for North Korea’s needs. Other factors will also shape the nature of North Korea’s networks into the future, including evolving technological developments and greater requirements for highly specialised technologies held by a smaller number of niche suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper, which seeks to provide insights to non-governmental analysts, government officials and industry practitioners, has five chapters. Chapter I gives a historical overview of North Korea’s technology procurement, emphasising that it has been a long-term buyer from the international marketplace, and highlighting continuity in approaches. Chapter II considers a loose typology of the equipment and goods that North Korea is pursuing and the UN sanctions that have sought to prevent technology transfer. Chapter III analyses North Korea’s more recent illicit procurement activities to understand current procurement priorities. Chapter IV takes a closer look at the entities involved in North Korea’s WMD-related illicit procurement, while Chapter V considers its future. The paper concludes with 10 recommendations to counter North Korea’s future illicit procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-historical-sources-of-technology&quot;&gt;I. Historical Sources of Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has long exploited external sources of technology to develop its nuclear and missile programmes. This chapter provides a brief historical overview for context and asks two pertinent questions: Where has North Korea’s WMD technology come from? And what was the role of illicit procurement? The chapter highlights the continuity in North Korea’s procurement approaches and methods over the past 50 years, showing that Pyongyang has, through necessity, used illicit procurement networks and methods to obtain military and strategic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supply-side controls have been used since at least the 1980s to prevent support to North Korea’s WMD programmes (see Box 1). During the Cold War, the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCoM) sought to prevent the transfer of Western technology to communist states, including North Korea. According to declassified CIA assessments, North Korea went on a “buying spree” of Western technology in the mid-1970s and again in the mid-1980s. As one assessment from 1988 notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Much of the technology and equipment P’yongyang wants is proscribed from export to North Korea; this makes clandestine acquisition, supplemented by dual-use purchases that can be modified to meet military requirements, a key element of the North’s effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;P’yongyang has focused much of its technology acquisition operations in Japan and Western Europe, where ethnic Korean communities or willing collaborators have helped in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment also noted the importance of Singapore, Hong Kong and Macau as sources of microelectronics and computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-1-the-value-of-supply-side-controls&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1: The Value of Supply-Side Controls&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“Supply-side controls” is a broad term used to denote the range of tools used to prevent the supply of technology to WMD proliferators (as opposed to demand-side measures that might address the reasons that states want WMD). These include export controls and technology-based sanctions, border and customs checks, actions against procurement networks, efforts to protect dual-use training and research from being exploited by proliferators, and counter-proliferation-financing measures.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Given that North Korea has achieved a nuclear weapons and ICBM capability, what is the value of continuing to implement supply-side controls to try to prevent North Korea’s procurement of WMD-related technologies? While the true impacts of supply-side controls are difficult to gauge, there are several arguments for their continued application.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Long-Term WMD Dependencies&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea will continue to rely, in the short to medium term, on imported technologies and its procurement networks as its arsenal develops. Indeed, more mature nuclear and missile programmes – for example those of Russia, which has been a nuclear weapons state for 75 years – are known to still rely on imported technologies decades after crossing the nuclear threshold.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Battlefield Use and Exports&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recent North Korean sales of missiles to Russia have seen their use against civilian populations in Ukraine. While supply-side controls are unlikely to prevent further transfers across the North Korea–Russia border, preventing the transfer of technologies, particularly of Western-manufactured micro-electronics, to North Korea could help to disrupt the production of missiles in North Korea for Vladimir Putin’s war machine. The ongoing resurgence of North Korea’s arms exports enterprise provides further rationale for continued supply-side controls.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Slowing Production and Increasing Costs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If supply chains are disrupted by supply-side measures, it will be more difficult for North Korea’s procurement agents to obtain the components and materials they need. This could slow production and potentially increase the costs of procurement, as agents pay above market rate to compete with legitimate buyers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Providing Intelligence&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Export licence applications completed by exporters can provide governments with valuable intelligence about the needs of North Korea’s WMD programmes and its procurement networks, in particular intermediaries, transhipment points and shipping routes. Exporters are required to provide details of technologies, entities and stated end-uses, which can provide useful insights.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Exploiting Existing Tools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The main states capable of supplying technology – members of key multilateral export control regimes such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) – already have export control systems and border controls in place. However, in some of these supplier states, for example China, export control implementation and enforcement are far from perfect. This, and the existence of a wide range of third-country hubs that proliferators can exploit, makes for large and significant loopholes in global supply-side controls. Nevertheless, great effort has been expended on developing these control systems, and the benefits of their continued use to counter North Korean procurement are clear.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;historical-nuclear-programme-procurement&quot;&gt;Historical Nuclear Programme Procurement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its pursuit of nuclear weapons, North Korea developed reactor and reprocessing technologies and also, as recognised later by the international community, uranium enrichment technology. While the plutonium side of the programme benefited from the construction of reactors and reprocessing facilities at Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center, less is known about the uranium enrichment side, with one large facility at Yongbyon revealed to foreign visitors in 2010. There are likely other facilities of unclear size and capability in other locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides of the fuel cycle have been developed with extensive use of imported technologies. The Yongbyon reactor itself was based on a simple and ageing design, likely requiring little imported technology. But other elements of the plutonium programme required technological support and, at the time, the Soviet Union, China and other communist states were seemingly unwilling to provide it. As a result, North Korea turned to the international marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after US intelligence identified in the early 1980s that North Korea was constructing a reactor, attempts by a North Korean entity to procure a wide range of technologies from West German companies were detected by the US government. The list included: 50 manipulators used to handle radioactive materials; remote control equipment; hot cells; shielding walls; ventilation and filter systems; glove boxes; and facilities for the manufacture, distribution, packaging and transport of radionuclides. As a November 1984 West German government paper noted: “In particular the last few items in the list … give rise to concern, as they seem to indicate North Korean plans to construct a (possibly unsafeguarded) reprocessing plant”. This led the US and the UK to consult with partners on efforts to prevent North Korean procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea also sought other technology from a West German company in the 1980s, including a small furnace in 1987, possibly through East Germany. Technicians and an official from the same company visited North Korea in 1989 and 1990. Further evidence of dual-use material and equipment procurement from West German and Swiss household name companies came to light in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 1986, a North Korean diplomat, Yun Ho-Jin, was based at the North Korean mission to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna. Building a network of contacts, Yun organised trade delegation visits to Europe, some of which resulted in purchases that ended up in Yongbyon. After North Korea withdrew from the IAEA in 1994, Yun took his networks and expertise “private”, establishing the Beijing-based Namchongang Trading Corporation (NCG), which would be added to the UN North Korea sanctions list in 2009 for its proliferation activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yun was far from the only diplomat active in procurement in Europe. Kim Jong Ryul, a procurement agent for the regime with a diplomatic passport, recalls procuring US-manufactured, NSG-controlled mass spectrometers in the 1990s, of use in “identifying uranium and plutonium particles”, using European front companies. North Korea also made use of other overseas connections. During the 1980s, the country turned to Korean residents in Japan through the Chongryon, the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, a kind of de facto embassy, to provide scientific support and dual-use goods from the Japanese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s centrifuge efforts became apparent much later, but in hindsight drew heavily on external support. Pakistan and the black-market network, run by Pakistani nuclear scientist A Q Khan, would provide North Korea with centrifuge design information. North Korea and Pakistan initially exchanged technology and knowledge in the 1990s. Later, around 2000, Khan’s network provided North Korea with about two dozen P-1 and P-2 centrifuges and measuring equipment, as well as allowing access to Pakistan’s centrifuge workshops at Khan Research Laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 1999 and 2003, Japanese authorities sought to prevent the export of frequency converters to North Korea – items of use in controlling centrifuges. In the early 2000s, North Korea attempted to procure extensive quantities of aluminium tubes for centrifuge construction. Yun Ho-Jin, the director of NCG, would be implicated in one unsuccessful – and possibly one successful – effort to import tubes for several thousand centrifuges. In 2002, the CIA noted that in the previous year, North Korea “began seeking centrifuge-related materials in large quantities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the UN sanctions listing, NCG was also involved in procurement for North Korea’s plutonium-related activities, procuring Japanese-origin vacuum pumps, likely of use in the fuel fabrication facility at Yongbyon. According to reporting, NCG had allegedly been procuring “gas masks, electric timers, steel pipes, vacuum pumps, transformers and aluminum tubes” from European markets in the early 2000s using the Beijing office, and that these procurements, some of which were destined for the Syrian Al-Kibar nuclear reactor project, had alerted the US to North Korea–Syria nuclear collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;historical-missile-programme-procurement&quot;&gt;Historical Missile Programme Procurement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s missile programme has also relied on external sources of technology from both states and the international marketplace, although recent developments in the longer-range programmes have resulted in systems unique to North Korea. The programmes began with short-range Soviet Scud systems obtained from Egypt, which were reverse engineered and scaled up to create the Nodong ballistic missile. North Korea allegedly benefited from human capital leaking from the collapsed Soviet Union in the early 1990s, and Soviet design influences were seen in the failed Musudan IRBM (intermediate range ballistic missile).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the external technology that has supported North Korea’s missile programme has come from the international marketplace. As with the nuclear programme, North Korea likely imported a range of missile and dual-use technologies from the early days of its indigenisation efforts. This included speciality steel from the Soviet Union and later Russia, and commercially produced power systems for the transporter erector launchers (TELs) carrying missiles from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong and Macau formed a key node in North Korea’s procurement networks from the 1980s. As a document from the UK National Archives notes, in 1993 the Hong Kong authorities raided the premises of a company with “extensive North Korean links”, which was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the subject of numerous intelligence reports indicating its involvement in procuring strategic items on behalf of North Korea. The items are imported to Hong Kong and then exported to Macau for onward transmission to North Korea … using hand couriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following year the company admitted the export of thousands of integrated circuits and components to North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has also sought trucks on which to carry its missiles, especially larger systems. In the early 1990s North Korea allegedly imported 30 Italian trucks carrying Austrian lifting equipment to produce TELs for its Nodong missiles. Around the same time, North Korea imported truck chassis from Germany for use in TEL production. Dependence on external sources for large truck chassis seems to have persisted into the UN sanctions era, when in 2012 six large eight-axle TELs were exhibited during a Pyongyang parade carrying an early ICBM design. The trucks had been procured from China in 2011, with the end use purported to be the lumber industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has also procured machine tools – manufacturing technologies with civil, military, missile and nuclear applications. The public record shows the role of entities in Taiwan in supplying machine tools since the 1990s. The network persisted into the UN sanctions era, when a Taiwanese businessman was indicted by a domestic court for the re-export of three types of US-origin machine tools to North Korea. In 2013, the Taiwanese businessman and his US-based son were arrested by the US authorities, with the son accused of establishing a US-based company to facilitate exports of hundreds of thousands of dollars of machine tools to his father for re-export to North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, around the time of North Korea’s first successful ICBM test in 2017, debate raged over the genesis of North Korea’s achievements. Some experts alleged that North Korea likely relied on rocket engines imported from Russia or Ukraine, or even on a Russian design, although no clear evidence was presented to support shipments of goods from either country. Doubts about the domestic origins of North Korea’s more recent ICBM designs have also been largely unfounded. North Korea’s recent success in its missile efforts appears to have been largely achieved with domestic designs and expertise honed over decades and built on external expertise and imported technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iitechnology-and-un-sanctions&quot;&gt;II.Technology and UN Sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 1980s, North Korea has sought to obtain a wide range of different types of technology for its weapons programmes – complete systems, constituent parts, materials and components, expertise, and sensitive information. This chapter digs deeper into the types of technology and the UN sanctions seeking to prohibit their transfer. It provides a loose typology of the technology; addresses the question of the role of North Korea’s technology imports, as opposed to domestic production and indigenisation; and explores key concepts, including “dual-use” and intangible technologies, in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-loose-typology&quot;&gt;A Loose Typology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As demonstrated in Chapter I, North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes have been built on imported technology. This is just part of North Korea’s procurement picture: imports of technology and illicit procurement networks have had a much wider application for North Korea’s strategic, defence and other development (see Box 2). They have allowed a country that long had a limited domestic industrial base to develop relatively advanced capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-2-chemical-biological-and-conventional-weapons-and-other-commodities&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 2: Chemical, Biological and Conventional Weapons and Other Commodities&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes may be its most impactful and well-recognised procurement area, but the country’s illicit networks seek a much wider range of prohibited goods that benefit a range of strategic efforts.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chemical Weapons&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea has an active chemical weapons programme, as demonstrated by the assassination in 2017 by North Korea of Kim Jong Un’s half-brother, Kim Jong-Nam, with the VX nerve agent. North Korea has relied on imported precursor chemicals (chemicals used to produce chemical weapons) for its programmes in the past.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Biological Weapons&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea is believed to have an active biological weapons programme. Analysis of images from a 2015 visit to a fertiliser factory suggested that the facility could produce bioweapons, and that modern equipment seen in the facility suggested an “active large-scale sanctions busting effort to illicitly procure the equipment” for the programme.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Military Technologies&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea has sought to illicitly procure military technologies, in breach of the UN arms embargo in place since 2006. Many dual-use materials used in WMD programmes will also have utility in military production. A 2013 interdicted shipment of arms from Cuba to North Korea also demonstrates North Korea’s interest in procuring spare parts for existing weapons systems.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Other Commodities&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea also illicitly procures a range of other goods prohibited by UN sanctions – from oil to run its economy and military, to luxury goods to maintain the regime.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 summarises the broad types of technology that North Korea has sought. These include technologies with direct and specialised applications in the nuclear and missile programmes. They include goods controlled by the NSG and the MTCR in their respective control lists: the NSG’s Part I “trigger list”; and the MTCR’s Annex Category I. Technologies sought include tangible materials, goods and components, as well as related intangibles – design information, sensitive data and knowledge relating to these items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5K0BIqW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Broad Types of Nuclear and Missile Technologies Sought by North Korea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dual-use technologies, those listed in the NSG guidelines’ Part II “dual-use list” and the MTCR Annex’s Category II list, also underpin North Korea’s programmes. In simple terms, dual-use technology describes those materials, goods, components and related intangibles that have both military and civilian applications. This loose category includes a wide range of technologies, everything from advanced materials and components to manufacturing capabilities. For example, alloys used in producing centrifuges could be used in the manufacture of civilian airliners, and carbon fibre used in centrifuges and missiles could have applications in high-end racing cars and yachts or even golf clubs. Machine tools used to machine centrifuge or missile components could be used in a wide range of high-end manufacturing applications. Many of the technologies used in centrifuge and missile plants – for example programmable logic controllers to control industrial processes, pumps, valves, pipes and hoses to facilitate the movement of liquids and operate centrifuges under vacuum – have applications in a wide range of other manufacturing facilities. Not all dual-use technology with applications in a WMD programme will be listed by the NSG and the MTCR, with items falling below the control thresholds still of utility to WMD programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolving-technological-needs&quot;&gt;Evolving Technological Needs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What parts of this broad nuclear and missile technological picture is North Korea currently seeking outside its borders? There is very limited evidence of North Korea’s procurement activity, especially in the nuclear area, which is a challenge for judging continued dependence. Nuclear and missile technology experts interviewed for this paper suggested there is likely a declining range of areas where North Korea is truly dependent on external sources of technology. North Korea is likely capable of producing most of the nuclear-specific goods it needs domestically after more than 40 years of effort, and this is probably also true for missile-specific technologies. Many of these most sensitive technologies are more challenging to obtain from the international marketplace and therefore have likely been priorities for North Korea’s indigenisation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, North Korea’s programmes are still far from self-sufficient, with the country looking externally for a range of technologies, including many dual-use goods. With such a wide range of dual-use technologies required for these programmes, North Korea would expend significant effort to try and produce all of them domestically. These dual-use technologies are also readily available from a wider range of international manufacturers than they were a decade ago. The present-day Chinese market is likely able to provide most, if not all, of the dual-use technologies required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, interest in certain types of goods from certain manufacturers or other countries for quality or prestige reasons might see procurement operatives target technology from the US, Europe and Japan, for example. Much of the evidence discussed in Chapter III supports this hypothesis. Many of the tangible technologies for which there is evidence of North Korea’s pursuit in recent years have been dual use. In terms of the missile programme, an expert interviewed remarked that Western goods “are not make or break for the programme”. There are, obviously, areas where procurement of very specialised goods or intangibles may be necessary or helpful, particularly in areas of more exotic and “emerging” technologies where North Korea has less experience, as discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above analysis therefore calls into question the utility of the term “chokepoints”, often used to refer to areas where proliferators are dependent on foreign sources of technology and can be squeezed by export controls. As one expert interviewee noted, the term is “problematic”, especially when used in relation to proliferators that have been seeking technology for decades and, recently, in an era when the global manufacturing base for dual-use technologies has grown. With dual-use technologies more readily available, states such as North Korea are more likely to be able to procure such technologies from states with weak export control implementation and enforcement, as well as from entities that are willing to sell to proliferators, or ignore red flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several transfer vectors relating to the intangibles of design information, sensitive data and knowledge. These include espionage, entering into technology transfer agreements, attending technical exchanges, training workshops or conferences, and engaging in research collaboration with entities overseas. More recent procurement of intangibles has likely taken the form of engaging in research collaborations, stealing information and data through hacks, and downloading open source research papers, as well as building domestic expertise through hands-on testing and refinement. Efforts to attract the expertise of external scientists and engineers, as occurred in the early 1990s following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, are less prominent in North Korea’s current efforts to access nuclear- and missile-related knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;un-sanctions-and-illicit-procurement&quot;&gt;UN Sanctions and Illicit Procurement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the nuclear, missile and dual-use technologies that North Korea is seeking are covered by the UN North Korea sanctions regime, which prohibits the transfer of goods to, and technical collaboration with, North Korea. The regime, imposed by the UN Security Council through its Chapter VII powers, is legally binding on all UN member states. The first UNSCR in 2006 (UNSCR 1695) required all states to “exercise vigilance and prevent” the transfer of missile and WMD technology to North Korea. A further resolution the same year (UNSCR 1718) was more specific, declaring that all member states “shall prevent the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer to the DPRK, through their territories or by their nationals, or using their flag vessels or aircraft, and whether or not originating in their territories” of nuclear and missile technology, and linking to the list of technologies in the 2006 version of the NSG guidelines and the MTCR’s “Equipment, Software and Technology Annex”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lists associated with these technologies have been updated periodically as the NSG and MTCR lists are updated annually. Resolutions in 2013 (UNSCR 2094) and 2016 (UNSCR 2321) provided annexes that included further goods to which the existing prohibitions would apply. The technology lists were last updated by the Sanctions Committee in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2006 (UNSCR 1718) there has also been a “catch-all” provision on the transfer of any technology that could contribute to North Korea’s WMD programmes. The Committee also notes that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All Member States are further required to implement a binding dual-use “catch-all” provision to apply the above measures on any item if the State determines that it could contribute to the DPRK’s nuclear or ballistic missile programmes, other weapons of mass destruction programmes or other activities prohibited by the resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond prohibitions on the transfer of controlled technology that should be implemented through UN members’ national systems for implementing export controls and sanctions, there are also various provisions for inspecting cargoes. Earlier UN Security Council resolutions “called upon” states to inspect cargo to and from North Korea, particularly if they had “information that provides reasonable grounds [for] believ[ing]” that the cargo contained prohibited items, including nuclear or missile technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resolutions also include prohibitions on activities that might allow North Korea to obtain intangibles relevant to WMD development. For example, as early as 2006 (UNSCR 1718), the sanctions decided that all UN members “shall prevent any transfers to the DPRK … of technical training, advice, services or assistance related to the provision, manufacture, maintenance or use” of the nuclear, missile or military items prohibited for transfer to North Korea. Three years later, UNSCR 1874 called upon UN members to “exercise vigilance and prevent specialised teaching or training of North Korea nationals within their territories or by their nationals, of disciplines which could contribute to North Korea’s proliferation sensitive nuclear activities and the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resolutions in 2016 further tightened restrictions. UNSCR 2270 required that “all Member States shall prevent specialised teaching or training of DPRK nationals within their territories or by their nationals of disciplines which could contribute to the DPRK’s proliferation sensitive nuclear activities”. UNSCR 2321 in 2016 provided more detail on the ban on training, and also decided that all UN members should “suspend scientific and technical cooperation involving persons or groups officially sponsored by or representing the DPRK except for medical exchanges”. UNSCR 2375 in 2017 also decided that states should prohibit joint ventures with North Korea entities, which could potentially involve collaboration on technology with overseas partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sanctions regime was monitored by the UNSCR 1718 Committee PoE, which was set up in 2009 and conducted investigations into various breaches and potential breaches of UN sanctions over the next 15 years. Through more than 20 mid-term and final reports, the PoE put significant information about North Korea’s illicit procurement into the public domain. The PoE was disbanded at the end of April 2024 following Russia’s veto of and China’s abstention on a resolution to extend its mandate to April 2025. The dissolution of the PoE significantly reduces scrutiny of the implementation of the UN sanctions on North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes, including those relating to technology transfer. Sanctions effectively remain in place, but unmonitored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-procurement-evidence-activity-and-needs-since-2017&quot;&gt;III. Procurement Evidence: Activity and Needs Since 2017&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the closure of many international borders between 2020 and 2023 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, North Korea has continued to procure controlled technology for its nuclear and missile programmes. As a UN PoE report noted in 2021, “foreign representatives of trading companies … including Korean Mining and Development Trading Corporation (KOMID) and Saengpil Associated Corporation, who have been stuck overseas during the pandemic, have continued to import and export munitions materials to earn foreign currency and to assist with the development of weapons”. Indeed, the US government designated seven North Korean procurement agents, based in China and Russia, during the pandemic years, along with a range of other operatives involved in cybercrime, arms sales and other revenue-raising activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the reopening of North Korea’s borders, and short-range missile transfers to Russia in the latter half of 2023, North Korea’s procurement networks are likely working at full speed to compensate for difficult business environments during the pandemic, and probably also to fulfil increased production for Russia’s orders, on top of meeting domestic needs. This chapter considers North Korea’s current procurement needs, focusing on evidence, largely from the past five years, of North Korean procurement activity and related concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nuclear-procurement-secretive-but-ongoing&quot;&gt;Nuclear Procurement: Secretive but Ongoing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little is publicly known about North Korea’s nuclear procurement efforts, particularly in recent years, due to the secrecy surrounding its nuclear programme and the limited number of seizures of nuclear-related goods. There is some limited evidence on the public record that goods of use in nuclear applications have been procured in recent years, some as recently as 2021. However, these were goods with both nuclear- and missile-related uses and were procured by networks that allegedly benefited entities linked to the ballistic missile programme, discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most recent publicly known example of nuclear procurement involved vacuum equipment, between 2013 and 2016. A North Korean national, Kang Mun Kil, working on behalf of NCG-related entities, was involved in the procurement of pressure transducers – used to regulate pressure in centrifuge-enrichment facilities – from a Chinese company in 2013 and 2016. Kang also likely used a Hong Kong-based company for nuclear-related procurement until it was dissolved in 2017. Besides information about these purchases, little is publicly known about where the technology for North Korea’s centrifuge programme originated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is believed that North Korea manufactures the centrifuges domestically, for which it requires imported advanced machine tools. State media visits to factories have shown that North Korea possessed many of the machines required to produce centrifuge parts a decade ago. As R Scott Kemp noted in 2013, “it appears that North Korea is, at a minimum, well on its way to freeing the centrifuge program from dependence on foreign supplies and technology”. These machine tools are mostly imports, with the public record showing North Korea’s efforts to procure tools from the US, Europe, Japan and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2020 list of “chokepoint” items put together by the UN PoE, detailing “items for its nuclear program which North Korea could seek to procure overseas”, included a range of centrifuge-related technologies. Among these were technologies for centrifuge manufacture (autoclaves, computer numerical control machine tools and high-strength materials) from composite materials (basalt fibre, carbon fibre, filament winding machines, glass fibre, para-aramid fibre) and metals (flow-forming machines, maraging steel); centrifuge facility pipework (bellows-sealed valves); vacuum systems (pressure gauges, pressure transducers, vacuum pumps) and control systems (inverters); and tools for isotopic analysis (mass spectrometers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has also been seeking goods for its fuel cycle assets used in the production of plutonium. In December 2023, the country first operated its experimental light water reactor, which had been under construction since 2010. Procurement for this project, as well as for the existing 5 MW and IRT-2000 reactors and reprocessing facilities, is likely to be ongoing. An unnamed UN member state expressed concern that at the end of 2018, North Korea had been looking to procure several dual-use nuclear items. These included: lithium hydroxide, “added to reactor coolants and functions to curb metal corrosion of nuclear reactor cooling pipes in military use”; high-purity graphite, used as a reactor moderator; and Austenitic stainless steel, a material used in nuclear reactors (and also with missile-related applications).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the UN PoE’s 2020 nuclear chokepoint list included technologies related to the plutonium side of the fuel cycle. These included technologies related to reactors (pressure vessels) and reactor fuel (zirconium for fuel cladding), as well as reactor moderators (deuterium, heavy water), materials for neutron absorption (boron powder, boron-10, graphite), and equipment for handling plutonium and other isotopes (manipulators, radiation shielding windows), as well as neutron detectors that are used in reactors and elsewhere where there are criticality-related safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond procurement for fissile material production, the PoE has suggested that North Korea continues to procure weaponisation-related technologies. Some of these were included in the 2020 nuclear chokepoint list, including those for preparation of fissile material cores (controlled atmosphere furnaces, isostatic presses), components for a nuclear device (beryllium, capacitors, triggered spark gaps) and nuclear testing instruments (flash X-ray equipment, high-speed cameras). While limited cases have been seen in the public domain, analysis by the PoE suggests that North Korea’s nuclear procurement needs remain wide ranging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;missile-procurement-persistent-and-more-prominent&quot;&gt;Missile Procurement: Persistent and More Prominent&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more publicly available information about North Korea’s recent ballistic missile procurement, likely in part due to the high levels of concern surrounding recent ICBM testing and the efforts of the US and allies to counter related procurement networks. Indeed, the most recent details about North Korea’s reliance on Western components have come from analysis of the wreckage of short-range missiles fired by Russia at targets in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research published by Conflict Armament Research (CAR) in February 2024 showcased 290 imported components including 50 unique component types in the wreckage of a single missile, likely a KN-23 or KN-24, recovered from Ukraine. These components provide insights into North Korea’s procurement needs for electronics. According to CAR, the components were procured from 26 companies based in eight jurisdictions: China; Germany; Japan; the Netherlands; Singapore; Switzerland; Taiwan; and the US. CAR noted that more than 75% of the components originated in the US, and more than 75% that could be dated were produced between 2021 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s reliance on imported electronic components for its missiles is well known, seen in analysed wreckage from the Unha-3 rocket launches of 2012 and 2016. That the wreckage from 2024 contained more than 150 components procured in the past two calendar years shows how active North Korea’s procurement networks continue to be. Recent press reports, however, suggest that at least some of the electronic components that appeared to be from European and Japanese sources were counterfeit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other procurement efforts, from as recently as 2023, also suggest North Korea’s reliance on imported materials and components. A 2024 PoE report suggests that in 2023, North Korean procurement operative Choe Chol Min (see Box 4) was “among other activities … involved in attempts to buy inertial measurement units”, likely of use in missile guidance systems. Choe’s wife, Choe Un Jong, was also said by US authorities in 2023 to be purchasing dual-use bearings of use in missile production. The report further noted that in 2023, North Korean procurement operatives “sought to import multiple tons of AlMg6, an aluminium-magnesium alloy, as well as stainless steel sheets”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showcasing the quantities of materials imported, at least four orders were also placed in early 2021, overseen by North Korean national Kim Jong Dok. These included “1Cr18Ni9Ti stainless steel, a special alloy used in missile applications”, with orders totalling more than 80,000 kg, as well as “other missile related technologies, including valves, pumps and ball bearings” and a total of 149,000 kg of other types of steel. A leaked US State Department cable detailing a démarche to China in 2008 notes that 1Cr18Ni9Ti stainless steel was previously used “in a variety of structural parts in Scud B and C missiles”, and the material may have similar uses in more modern North Korean systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019 and 2020, Rim Ryong Nam, a North Korean procurement operative based in Shenyang, China, allegedly shipped several tons of aluminium powder, a material of use in solid missile fuel production, to North Korea “on multiple occasions”. A 2020 PoE report noted that North Korea likely needs around 10 tons of aluminium powder annually to support its programme. In early 2018, Rim Ryong Nam was also known to be seeking aluminium powder, as well as other commodities of use in solid-propelled rocket manufacture, including: MAPO, a chemical of use in bonding solid propellant; industrial-use argon; electrolytic copper; metallic chrome; acetone and steel plates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the evidence relating to specific efforts to procure goods, the PoE, the US and an unnamed UN member state have provided information about the types of missile-related goods and materials that North Korea has been trying to source in recent years. Most recently, a 2024 PoE report included a schematic of 60 types of “critical items needed” by North Korea for its ballistic missile programme, noting that 23 of these constituted an “identified target of North Korea international procurement between 2018 and 2023”. While the report highlighted the extensive procurement efforts, it also noted that North Korea had “increased its self-sufficiency” in the manufacture of equipment and components for missile production. This included areas related to manufacturing casings and other complex metal parts, airframes and TELs. The report, drawing on UN member state information, also suggested that North Korea continued to be dependent on imports of “specialty steels and aluminium” and higher-grade carbon fibre, although lower-grade materials would suffice for many requirements in the programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2020 US government North Korea Ballistic Missile Procurement Advisory, central to recent US outreach on North Korea procurement, listed eight categories and almost 30 different types of technologies, with a special emphasis on alloys. The information in the Advisory appears to have formed the basis of a 2020 briefing delivered to the PoE which provided more details about North Korea’s capabilities, including chokepoints in production. The construction of extra-large TELs appeared to be something that North Korea had struggled with “for reasons of cost and technology”. In terms of metals, North Korea had “had  difficulty” producing the “quantity and quality” of speciality steels and aluminium. With regard to chemicals used in solid propellent motors, the member state noted that “although the DPRK had manufacturing capacity”, its plant “might not be operating well”, with North Korean engineers having difficulty “producing such materials at the right degree of purity and particulate size”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were similar statements about North Korea’s procurement needs in previous years. Information passed to the PoE by a member state, and published in 2019, indicated that North Korea was procuring goods for processing missile-related chemicals. This included digital indicating controllers, lithium carbonate, sodium fluoride, epichlorohydrin and activated charcoal. A member state also noted that at the end of 2018, North Korea was looking to and may have succeeded in procuring MAPO, “Martensitic stainless steel”, of use in rocket engine parts, and “Austenitic stainless steel”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intangible-technologies-by-any-means&quot;&gt;Intangible Technologies: By Any Means&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond tangible goods, North Korea has also widely sought related intangible technologies. As Philip Baxter and others have noted, North Korea has “pursued a multi-prong strategy to acquire nuclear intangible technology”, adapting its scientific collaborations around sanctions and “coalesc[ing] a cluster of individual researchers and research institutions that are interconnected with each other and with foreign researchers and institutions”. Beyond its international collaborations, North Korea has pursued and likely will continue to pursue, in a more constrained environment, educational and training opportunities overseas, and conduct hacks of technology-holding entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the 2016 UN ban on scientific and technical cooperation, a 2017 investigation noted that China was home to the “bulk” of North Korean scientists abroad, quoting official Chinese education ministry statistics indicating that 1,086 North Koreans were studying at postgraduate level in China in 2015. The same investigation noted one North Korean scientist studying topics at PhD level related to missile development at one of China’s elite aerospace universities (see Box 3). North Korean students at this institution also downloaded 57,000 research papers on a single day in 2017. A further 2018 study identified 100 published journal articles jointly authored by North Korean and external scientists in areas with significance for WMD and dual-use technologies. This included articles on space- and missile-related technologies, precision machine tools, optical tracking and GPS technology, all authored with Chinese colleagues in 2016 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-3-spy-scientists-north-koreans-on-chinese-campuses&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 3: Spy-Scientists: North Koreans on Chinese Campuses&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;An investigation in 2017 by The Wall Street Journal highlighted the role of North Korea’s scientists studying in China, and particularly the role of one individual, a scientist named Kim Kyong Sol, who was based at China’s elite Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT). The institute ranked highly in areas such as aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, automation and control, and metallurgical engineering. Kim’s area of study was “mechatronics—a blend of mechanical engineering, electronics and programming”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Kim’s work concerned “MR damping”, a technology used in stabilising spacecraft and absorbing shock in missile-launch systems, including in submarine platforms. He published some results from his research in 2016 with Chinese colleagues, listing his affiliation as “Department of Mechanical Engineering, Kim Chaek University of Technology, Pyongyang, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea”. He also published an article in 2017 co-authored with a senior engineer in the Chinese space programme. In 2021 Kim published an article on a similar topic in a North Korean journal.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Footnotes in the 2016 paper Kim co-authored show the research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, a research foundation directly linked to the State Council of the People’s Republic of China. The funding related to hypersonic vehicles. HIT signed an agreement on cooperation with Kim Il Sung University in 2011.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2013, North Korea sent the first group of 12 doctoral and post-doctoral students to enrol at HIT, with 28 working there by 2015. Kim, and at least 11 other North Koreans, left HIT in summer 2017, with others switching to subjects not covered by sanctions, such as management. According to university staff interviewed by The Wall Street Journal, “The North Koreans all had Chinese government scholarships, they said, which provided free housing and tuition and monthly stipends of about 3,000 yuan ($450)”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean operatives have also hacked foreign companies, including the systems of NPO Mashinostroyeniya, a Russian missile and space company that produces ICBMs, hypersonic missiles and satellites. This intrusion began in late 2021 and continued until the company uncovered it in May 2022, allowing the hackers “the ability to read email traffic, jump between networks, and extract data”. Beyond hypersonic technology (the company produces the Russian 3M22 Zircon hypersonic cruise missile), North Korea could have been interested in other technologies developed by the company, for example, ampulisation technology, where liquid-fuelled missiles are fuelled and sealed in the factory, allowing higher combat readiness for extended periods. More broadly, Microsoft noted in a 2023 report that the “North Korean government is assigning multiple cyber groups to meet high-priority collection requirements to improve the country’s military capabilities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-procurement-entities-organisations-and-operatives&quot;&gt;IV. Procurement Entities: Organisations and Operatives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such wide-ranging procurement needs, North Korea relies on a diverse network of procurement operatives based in a range of countries, but mostly focused on China and Russia. This chapter considers the organisations, the types of actors working on their behalf, the industry targets these networks seek to exploit, and the procurement intermediaries. Case studies are used to provide further details on the types of actors that coordinate and make up these supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;organisations-and-front-companies&quot;&gt;Organisations and Front Companies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many entities involved in North Korea’s illicit procurement operations for nuclear- and missile-related goods, as well as for broader military, chemical and biological warfare, luxury goods and other commodities. North Korea’s sanctions-busting networks are near to global in scope, and their procurement aspects represent a narrower sub-section, based in and around economies with advanced technologies. The entities for which there is open source information likely represent the tip of the iceberg, and also may already be inactive. As a member state has noted: “In order to circumvent sanctions, North Korea changes its import/export-related organisation structures every eight months”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these constraints, Figures 1–3 offer an overview of North Korea’s WMD-related procurement apparatus, showing selected parent entities, state trading companies and front companies. There are likely other front companies and operations that are not detailed in open sources and may even be unknown to interested intelligence agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s nuclear- and missile-related procurement infrastructure is spread across several government entities that run front companies which both raise revenue and purchase goods. Of these, least is known about nuclear-related procurement, undertaken by entities such as NCG, falling under the control of the General Bureau of Atomic Energy (GBAE), or the Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry (MAEI), as it appears to have been named since 2013. The UN describes both the GBAE and the MAEI as having oversight of the operation of the Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procurement for the ballistic missile programme is largely undertaken by entities which fall under the Munitions Industries Department (MID), “responsible for overseeing the development of the DPRK’s ballistic missiles”. Under MID is the Academy of National Defense Science (ANDS, previously the Second Academy of Natural Sciences, SANS), which UN sanctions lists note is “involved in the DPRK’s efforts to advance the development of its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs”. Information provided by an anonymous UN member state notes that ANDS has a “procurement office” that oversees the front companies and procurement agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also falling under MID is the Second Economic Committee, which, the UN has noted, is “responsible for overseeing the production of the DPRK’s ballistic missiles, and directs the activities of KOMID”. MID may also oversee some procurement for the nuclear weapons programme, because it includes the Nuclear Weapons Institute. A third entity, the Ministry of Rocket Industry (MORI), was sanctioned by the US in 2022 and noted to be “owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the MID”. The US State Department has noted that MORI “works with DPRK overseas representatives from other DPRK organisations to support Ministry of Rocket Industry procurement goals”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procurement is also undertaken by entities connected to the Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces and the Korean People’s Army. The Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), “DPRK’s premiere intelligence organization”, oversees the arms trading company Green Pine Associated, which has been involved in procurement. The RGB also has been connected to cyber actors such as the Lazarus Group, which in a high-profile case in 2023 hacked a Russian missile manufacturer for sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lines suggest subordination and loose control, rather than necessarily being indicative of supplier relationship.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The figures do not include entities for which there is no evidence of a WMD-related procurement role, even if they are known front companies involved in arms trading or other related activities. Information on entities’ role in procurement can be found in RUSI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://dprk-reports.org/&quot;&gt;“DPRK Reports Database”&lt;/a&gt;, which uses information from the PoE reports and details involvement in illicit WMD-related procurement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following entities are either not listed in the database or are listed without information about procurement: Korea Kumsan Trading Corporation; Tosong Technology Trading Company; New East International Trading; Ryonbong General Corporation; Korea Kwangsong Trading Corporation; Korea Hyoksin Trading Corporation; Korea Ryonhap Trading Corporation; Korea Ryungsong Trading Company; and Green Pine Associated Corporation. Evidence of the procurement role of these entities (rather than of arms sales, some of which pre-dates the first PoE report in 2010, and even UN sanctions in 2006) has been drawn from US designations, leaked US State Department cables and media articles. The US Treasury suggests that at least one of the four trading companies subordinate to MORI has imported “large equipment manufactured by a European company to North Korea”, without specifying which (all four are included in the figure). See &lt;a href=&quot;https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0695&quot;&gt;US Treasury, “Treasury Targets Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) Weapons of Mass Destruction Organization and Subsidiaries”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The opaque nature of these networks means that it is unclear to which parent entity some of the front companies are subordinate. The front companies likely change frequently to avoid scrutiny. Procurement is known to not have been undertaken by some of the entities in Figures 1–3 (at least according to what can be gleaned from open sources) for a decade or longer. Demonstrating North Korea’s flexibility in managing overseas business affairs, there are also cases (including those detailed below) where individuals working for another part of North Korea’s government, for example as diplomats for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also work on behalf of these procurement entities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;network-actors-broker-diplomat-scientist-spy&quot;&gt;Network Actors: Broker, Diplomat, Scientist, Spy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean operatives work for these entities overseas. There may be tens or even more than 100 of these individuals operating at any one time, although, as a UN member state noted in 2019: “The number of DPRK procurement agents overseas is decreasing and those remaining are focusing on the procurement of critical missile related components as well as dual-use and below-threshold items”. These procurement operatives likely remained overseas during the years of Covid-19 border closures, with Pyongyang only starting to rotate senior diplomats for the first time since the 2020 border closures in late 2023. This section takes a closer look at these procurement agents, as well as other diverse actors involved in technology acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 5: Nodes in North Korea’s WMD-Related Procurement Network (Asia, 2018–present)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figures 4 and 5 provide a geographical overview of North Korea’s procurement networks, drawing together data from 2018 to the present. Designations over the past few years have highlighted the role of North Korea’s procurement operatives in China and Russia. For example, in 2022, the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated one Russia-based and four China-based North Korean nationals for their roles in procurement representing “SANS-subordinate organisations”. These included one person in Vladivostok who had procured telecoms-related items from Russian firms, two in Dalian who had procured steel, and two in Shenyang who had procured software and chemicals. This followed the designation of 10 China-based representatives of the Korea Ryonbong General Corporation in 2018. As the press release noted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many of these individuals are located at Ryonbong representative offices in China near the China-North Korean border, where they support the regime in a variety of ways: the Ji’an office handled large quantities of a wide variety of multi-purpose goods such as chemicals, drilling equipment, hoses, metals, and machines; the Dandong office procured multi-purpose items for North Korean arms proliferators; and the Linjiang office often was tasked to fill orders consisting of high quantities of goods worth several millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other recent cases have also involved procurement operatives in China and Russia. In 2023, the US sanctioned a Beijing-based husband and wife procurement team (see Box 4). Recent PoE reports have also emphasised the role of North Koreans based in China, including Kim Jong Dok, who placed orders with another Dandong-based North Korean national, and Rim Ryong Nam, based in Shenyang (see Chapter II).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-4-procurement-operatives-keeping-it-in-the-family&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 4: Procurement Operatives: Keeping it in the Family&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In June 2023, the US Treasury sanctioned two North Korean nationals for their involvement in the procurement of technology for North Korea’s missile programme. These individuals were Choe Chol Min, “a Beijing-based SANS representative who has worked with DPRK weapons trading officials, PRC [Chinese] nationals, and other associates” and his wife, Choe Un Jong, a Beijing-based North Korean diplomat.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Born in 1978, Choe Chol Min appears to have a background in scientific research. An individual with the same name appears to have published a series of academic papers under an affiliation at the Kim Chaek University of Technology in Pyongyang. These papers on materials and castings – if written by the same person – suggest he was well placed to understand procurement requirements and assess potential suppliers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The US sanctions notification noted that Choe “received procurement requests from the DPRK for items and coordinated with associates to fulfill those orders”. It also identifies other activities, including collaborating with SANS representatives “to facilitate the dispatch of over a thousand DPRK workers” to China. These appear to be forced labourers, used to generate funds which are made available for the regime’s use, rather than missile technicians or scientists. The listing also notes Choe’s support to North Korea’s “primary weapons trading entity”, likely to be KOMID, in line with similar US language use, and his work with “DPRK weapons trading officials to purchase electronic equipment for Iranian customers”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Choe Un Jong, “officially assigned” to the North Korean embassy in Beijing, allegedly supported her husband’s work, and “helped coordinate an order with one or more SANS associates for dual-use bearings that are used in DPRK ballistic missile production”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the procurement operatives, North Korea’s diplomats have long played a role supporting the country’s nuclear and missile programmes. This was seen from the earliest days of North Korea’s procurement operations, as they sought to breach the CoCoM embargo. Chapter I describes the role of diplomats such as Yun Ho-Jin and Kim Jong Ryul in Western Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s. North Korean diplomats have continued to play this procurement role, alongside their role in holding together North Korea’s broader sanctions-busting networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embassies in several locations have emerged as procurement hubs for North Korea’s WMD programmes, particularly those in more developed countries with close access to advanced manufacturing technologies. In Europe, Germany and Switzerland have traditionally been a hunting ground for North Korea’s procurement operatives. In 2018, a senior German intelligence source noted that the North Korean embassy in Berlin was being used for WMD-related procurement. The North Korean embassies in Moscow and Beijing also appear to have played an important role in procurement. The embassy in Moscow has featured in two recent cases, including one involving O Yong Ho (see Box 5). The embassy in Beijing hosted Choe Un Jong, one half of the husband and wife procurement team described in Box 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other types of diplomatic missions and those adjacent to states hosting WMD-related technologies have also been utilised. For example, diplomats connected to a North Korean trade delegation in Belarus were found to be targeting sensitive rocketry-related information in Ukraine around 2011. The 2018 sanctioning of 10 North Korean procurement operatives included an individual noted to be the “Vice Consul of North Korean Consulate General in Nakhodka, Russia”. A representative of North Korea’s state airline Air Koryo, based in Dandong, is also noted in a US sanctions listing to have been “involved in the transportation of electronic parts from China to the DPRK on behalf of the DPRK’s Ministry of Rocket Industry (MORI)”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-5-dodgy-diplomats-technology-from-russia-with-love&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 5: Dodgy Diplomats: Technology from Russia with Love&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;O Yong Ho, a commercial counsellor in North Korea’s embassy in Moscow, is alleged to have acted as a procurement agent for ANDS in Russia. A UN member state provided information that alleged that he was “in charge of procurement of civilian production-related and consumer goods in the country” and attempted to procure a wide range of strategic commodities between 2016 and 2020.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;These strategic goods included aramid fibre (brand name Kevlar – a type of composite material of use in body armour, missiles and potentially centrifuges), aramid fibre production equipment, “a spinning nozzle”, four chemicals, stainless steel used in liquid-fuelled ballistic missiles, and steels used in submarine manufacture and bearings. The largest quantity of any individual product was submarine steel – the diplomat sought to purchase 3,000 tons (worth more than $10 million). This amount of steel is significant, with the Romeo-class submarine on which North Korea’s new missile submarine is based weighing around 2,500 tons. In 2016, O allegedly brought a delegation of North Korean officials to inspect the metal. In 2017, he sought hot and cold isostatic presses, used in manufacturing nose tips for re-entry vehicles, and nozzle inserts for rocket motors.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;O also allegedly sought intangibles. He obtained handwritten instructions for using a specific catalyst in solid rocket fuel from a Russian contact. He also received CAD drawings for a TRDD-50 cruise missile, a Soviet nuclear-capable system first deployed in the 1980s, from a now “allegedly deceased” Russian rocket scientist.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond procurement agents and diplomats, North Korea has also relied on other North Korean nationals for procurement of intangibles – notably scientists and hackers. North Korea has long sought to benefit from scientific expertise overseas, including through trying to attract scientists to North Korea, and sending North Koreans overseas to benefit from education and training. China has been a long-time target of North Korea’s sensitive information gathering, especially in recent years, as its scientific capabilities have grown (see Box 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;targeted-industry&quot;&gt;Targeted Industry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean procurement operatives target a variety of types of companies that produce the technologies described in Chapter II. This ranges from those who are willing to knowingly supply North Korea to those willing to ignore the full background of those they are selling to, to those who are unwittingly targeted and exploited. The use of procurement agents outside North Korea, intermediaries in third countries (those not hosting the supplier or customer), and the use of a range of deceptive practices have historically allowed North Korea’s procurement operatives – and indeed those of other proliferating countries – to dupe industry that is trying to comply with export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s interest in Russia and China stems from the availability of technology and the prevalence of manufacturers for the goods. Recent cases have reflected this, with Kim Jong Dok placing orders through a North Korean-controlled front company with “several Chinese companies”, allegedly including firms in the cities of Zibo and Shandong. Elsewhere it was noted that he regularly placed orders with unspecified “third country based” companies – presumably those outside North Korea and China. In the case of Rim Ryong Nam, aluminium powder and chemicals were procured from another company in Shandong province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these contexts, some cases show that North Korean agents have built relationships with specific local companies over a longer period – indeed, this would probably be their aim, in order to create a steady supply of technologies. One Russian businessman who sold bearings to North Korea and was sanctioned by the US Treasury noted that he maintained a relationship with a North Korean diplomat based at the embassy in Moscow for several years, and was passed on to the diplomat’s successor when he returned to Pyongyang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Russia and especially China, with its rapidly expanding manufacturing base, likely can provide many of the dual-use technologies required by North Korea. However, North Korea’s procurement operatives may still look elsewhere for some technologies to sustain its programmes, either because they seek particular items of the highest quality, or because of a bias in favour of items from specific manufacturers or jurisdictions such as the US, EU states or Japan. These goods may include high-end semiconductors similar to those found in the missile wreckage from Ukraine, or high-end machine tools and spare parts. Procuring from third countries such as China, an enormous and important market for normal and benign exports, likely helps to alleviate some concerns of export compliance officers based in these exporting companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political will on the part of many supplier states to implement both sanctions and export control systems, and their willingness to engage industry to counter illicit procurement, mean that WMD-related procurement efforts more frequently rely on deception. To this end, WMD-related procurement operatives, including those working for North Korea, have developed a range of deception methods over time (see Box 6). Many of these are not new, having also been used by other proliferators to procure technologies in breach of embargoes – from the Soviet Union during the Cold War to Iran, Iraq, Israel, Pakistan and Syria – to supply their WMD programmes. These means of deception are also designed to make it more difficult for export control enforcement, intelligence and customs authorities to uncover illicit procurement networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-6-means-of-deception-how-does-north-korea-dupe-industry&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 6: Means of Deception: How Does North Korea Dupe Industry?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Goods&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;By carefully selecting the types of goods they are looking to procure, North Korea operatives enhance their chance of successful procurement.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Sub-control-threshold items being procured, rather than controlled items, can result in less scrutiny. In some cases, sub-threshold items (for example, electronic components) can be used in WMD programmes, but are more likely to fail in these applications.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Second-hand items are less likely to be viewed as sensitive and are more likely to be sold by those who do not understand the risks of illicit procurement&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Industry Targets&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Certain types of industry targets will be more susceptible to North Korea’s illicit procurement and WMD-related illicit procurement more broadly, particularly those that work in ways that avoid direct contact with sellers or permit procurement without approaching the manufacturers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Second-hand markets are likely to be less regulated and may facilitate North Korea’s procurement operatives’ avoidance of approaching the manufacturers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Business-to-business websites can allow procurement agents to retain more anonymity.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Distributors generally have a lesser understanding of the products and what they can be used for and may be less concerned about reputational risk, since their logo is not on the product.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Naive exporters, for example those new to export or with weak domestic compliance programmes, may undertake limited due diligence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Methods&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea’s procurement operatives will commonly use several methods to deceive exporters and export controllers, often to obscure the true end user or end use.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Third-country entities or transhipment hubs – for example, China, Russia and Hong Kong – are used to route goods and obscure the end-user.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Multiple intermediaries are used to help to obscure the true buyer.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Aliases and a range of different letterheads are used to get around being listed or designated.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Falsifying end-user undertaking, making it look as if the end-user has a legitimate civil use for the products.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Transfer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Once successfully procured, certain methods will be used to reduce the chances that shipments are interdicted on their route to North Korea.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mislabelling goods in documentation – “machinery” or “spare parts” are less likely to gain attention than listing specific products.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Falsifying shipping documentation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Concealment of the goods, for example at the back of a shipping container, or underneath similar but uncontrolled items.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intermediaries-chinese-cross-border-networks-and-moving-the-goods&quot;&gt;Intermediaries: Chinese Cross-Border Networks and Moving the Goods&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of intermediaries in China has been extensive in North Korea’s procurement networks. China has long accounted for the bulk of North Korea’s international trade, and has also emerged as a significant producer of dual-use technologies in recent decades. This has made the border between China and North Korea, and specifically the Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge across the Yalu River in the town of Dandong, central to North Korea’s procurement operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large mixed Chinese networks illegally selling North Korean coal in China and using the proceeds to purchase general commodities such as sugar and fertiliser as well as dual-use goods – and potentially nuclear- and missile-related items – and moving them across the border have provided a lifeline for North Korea’s economy and its strategic programmes. A 2020 RUSI report noted the close-knit nature of these networks, highlighting that a small set of 150 Chinese companies accounted for around 20–25% of global exports to North Korea in 2015 and 2016. The report also noted that of these 150 companies’ shipments to North Korea, 93.4% were moved by motor vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the activities of these networks has been more challenging since shipment-level trade data for exports from China to North Korea became unavailable in 2017. However, indictment of two of the larger networks by the US in that timeframe, including that of Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co. Ltd and Dandong Zhicheng Metallic Material (see Box 7), provides insights into the workings of these mixed procurement networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-7-the-dealers-of-dandong-the-role-of-chinese-intermediaries&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 7: The Dealers of Dandong: The Role of Chinese Intermediaries&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Large cross-border trade networks run by Chinese intermediaries have acted as procurement proxies, enabling North Korea’s designated entities to access the global financial system, and selling North Korean commodities to raise funds in China that are then used to buy much-needed commodities and WMD-related goods.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co. Ltd (DHID), part of a wider network overseen by Chinese national Ma Xiaohong, was indicted in 2017 for efforts to evade sanctions and allowing North Korea to access the US financial system using a dual-ledger system and many front companies. An internal company PowerPoint slide deck from 2010, published by the US Justice Department with the indictment, claimed that the company accounted for 20% of China–North Korea trade at that time. Other analysis from trade data has echoed the importance of this network, including DHID accounting for $93 million of exports to North Korea between 2014 and 2017, and $532 million of China–North Korea business between 2011 and 2015. Some of the commodities procured through the network included dual-use goods such as aluminium ingots, aluminium oxide and a tungsten compound.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dandong Zhicheng Metallic Material (also known as Dandong Chengtai Trading Co., Ltd), established in 2005, was part of a second network of companies, overseen by Dandong-based Chinese accountant Chi Yupeng. A confidential source quoted in a 2017 US complaint noted that Dandong Zhicheng imported nearly $700 million of North Korean coal between 2013 and 2017. RUSI analysis of trade data suggests that the company accounted for nearly $500 million of North Korean exports between 2014 and 2017, making it the biggest of the 150 Chinese companies analysed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The proceeds of coal sold through Chinese intermediaries were used to purchase a range of products, including “bulk commodities (sugar, rubber, petroleum products, soybean oil), cell phones, luxury items, or dual-use technology”. A RUSI report identified several companies in Shenyang as likely purchasing front companies, which trade data indicated had exported goods such as arc welding machines and electrodes, thermostats, barometers and spherical roller bearings to North Korea between 2011 and 2017.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As noted by a defector who had first-hand knowledge of Office 39, the office generating revenue for the Kim regime’s personal finances, 95% of funds generated through coal sales are put “toward the advancement of North Korea’s military, nuclear missiles and other weapons programs”. Defector testimony summarised in the case also noted a small number of individuals were key nodes in North Korea’s networks, including Chi Yupeng, who had gained a “trusted position with, and maintained close ties to, North Korean government and North Korean military”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The US sought civil asset forfeitures against these two networks, seeking $74 million from DHID and $4.08 million from the network surrounding Dandong Zhicheng.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these Chinese intermediary networks move vast quantities of goods across the border, other means are also used to move more sensitive goods to North Korea. In the case of O Yong Ho (see Box 5), he planned to move goods – a large quantity of steel – by rail from Moscow to the rail terminal at the border with North Korea. The US designated representatives of state airline Air Koryo for “engaging in transportation and procurement activities”, noting that they “help the airline transport goods back to the DPRK on behalf of two UN- and U.S.-designated entities involved in intelligence activities, arms trade, and the DPRK’s ballistic missile and nuclear programs”. One of these individuals, an Air Koryo “logistics manager”, worked in Beijing to transfer goods to the RGB in Pyongyang, likely by air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, the diverse nature of the entities involved in these networks, their geographical locus in China and Russia, and their long experience in illicit procurement activities have made these networks challenging to counter. North Korea’s declining dependency on manufacturing bases beyond China and Russia, its successes, and the changing geopolitical situation necessitate consideration of future trends that will shape North Korea’s procurement networks, which is the focus of the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v-north-koreas-future-procurement-networks&quot;&gt;V. North Korea’s Future Procurement Networks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent developments, including those outside the technical developments in North Korea’s programmes, have implications for the future of North Korea’s procurement networks. This chapter considers some of the main factors that will shape the future of these networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolving-procurement-needs&quot;&gt;Evolving Procurement Needs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s procurement networks and the technologies they are targeting will evolve in line with the country’s technological needs. As the UN PoE noted, North Korea has been successful in indigenising the production of technologies in certain areas, which may reduce the need to import certain goods. The evolution of North Korea’s programmes will also shape needs, with two examples provided in a recent PoE report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the ongoing shift towards solid-fuel systems, including the potential mass production of the new solid-fuelled ICBM for domestic use, and the short-range KN-23 type missiles for sale to Russia, will create greater requirements for the import of solid-fuel precursors, on which North Korea appears to have some dependency. North Korea’s Five-Year Plan for the development of defence science and weapons systems lists “solid fuel propulsion for submarine-launched and ground-based ICBMs” as a priority area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, as North Korea seeks to create greater accuracy for its missile systems, also an objective listed in the 2021 Five-Year Plan, there may be greater demand for guidance components, including “foreign-procured high-quality gyroscopes, accelerometers, complete inertial measurement units and electronics”. Other priority areas listed in the Five-Year Plan may create new procurement requirements, including in relation to military reconnaissance satellites, R&amp;amp;D in hypersonic glide vehicles, nuclear-powered submarines and UAVs. This will likely create greater needs for imports in the shorter term, although North Korea’s indigenisation efforts may offset this in the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-north-korearussia-axis&quot;&gt;The North Korea–Russia Axis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s recently renewed relationship with Russia may provide it with access to certain technologies for its WMD programmes, undermining the need to source them from the international marketplace. Media reports surrounding Kim Jong Un’s September 2023 visit to Russia, which included stops at a cosmodrome and a fighter jet factory, suggested that North Korea was interested in “advanced technology for satellites and nuclear-powered submarines”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia could potentially supply many of the technologies that North Korea is seeking for the Five-Year Plan for the development of defence science and weapons systems it adopted in 2021. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated in September 2023 that the UN sanctions were “adopted in a completely different geopolitical situation”. Further technological transfers are likely, although these may stop short of direct support to North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes, which would be highly controversial. Russia may be incentivised to provide technology to North Korea as a further means of challenging the US and partners, although North Korea’s need for other commodities, including food and fertiliser, for example, means that such sensitive technological barter is not a given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;more-specialised-targets&quot;&gt;More Specialised Targets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea is likely to continue to import tangible items for ongoing production at the same time as seeking more niche and advanced tangible and intangible technologies for its development efforts to fulfil its objectives under the Five-Year Plan. The pursuit of technologies related to hypersonics, missile front-end development, satellites and submarine-launched ballistic missiles, for example, means there must be efforts to tap into a smaller pool of highly specialised targets for key technologies, particularly for intangibles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the possibility of some technology being willingly provided by Russia, the expansion of North Korea’s cyber capabilities means that hacks to obtain sensitive information, such as the hack (linked to the Lazarus Group) of a Russian missile manufacturer, are likely to be more common. A 2023 Microsoft report noted that North Korea’s hackers had targeted national defence industries in at least 16 countries, with the five countries most frequently targeted being Russia (14% of attacks recorded), the US (10%), Israel (10%), Germany (9%) and India (7%). Some of the targets that develop very specialist information, such as universities, research organisations and tech startups, for example in the NewSpace industry (developing access to space and spaceflight technologies), may represent softer targets than government facilities and larger corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;procurement-for-partners&quot;&gt;Procurement for Partners&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procurement of missile- and potentially nuclear-related technologies may also be undertaken by North Korea for partners, alongside the transfer of technology from North Korea itself. North Korea has a long history of overseas missile sales for profit, as well as previously selling nuclear technologies to partners (see Box 8). The risks posed by a return to North Korean missile and potentially nuclear exports are growing. From under the security of a nuclear deterrent, with a greater range of products to offer, some of which have been visibly battlefield tested in Ukraine, a sanctions regime near to collapse and a strengthening partnership between existing customers such as Russia, Iran and Syria, North Korea could be in a good place to benefit from sales. The country’s procurement networks, therefore, may be more likely to undertake this procurement for partners in the near future, as well as to fulfil domestic needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-8-a-nuclear-and-missile-supermarket-north-korea-as-procurement-contractor&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 8: A Nuclear and Missile Supermarket? North Korea as Procurement Contractor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea has long been an exporter of missile, and in a smaller number of cases, nuclear, technologies. A wide range of customers for missile technology in the 1980s and 1990s has been slimmed down to a smaller number of collaborative relationships, with countries such as Iran and Syria at the forefront. The recent transfers of missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine may lead to a broader renaissance for North Korea’s missile-exporting industry.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The most significant example of nuclear exports was the assistance that North Korea provided to Syria in the construction of a nuclear reactor at Al-Kibar, which was bombed by Israel in 2007. In a 2017 case, North Korea apparently marketed H-bomb isotope Lithium-6 on a Chinese business-to-business website in an open advert that could be linked through a telephone number to North Korea’s embassy in Beijing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea’s activities in these areas have involved sourcing materials, goods and components for joint projects, whether Iranian missile projects being undertaken jointly with North Korean technicians in Iran, or goods for the Al-Kibar reactor project. In this sense, North Korea provides a contracting service to its partners.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;potential-collapse-of-un-sanctions&quot;&gt;Potential Collapse of UN Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s violation of UN sanctions through arms and missile purchases from North Korea could lead to a more extensive collapse of the UN sanctions regime. The regime has been on life support for several years, with a failed attempt to secure a further sanctions resolution in May 2022, and no new entities added to the sanctions list since 2017. The 2024 demise of the PoE due to a Russian veto and Chinese abstention from a vote to extend its mandate is a further sign. Besides Russia, China has long dragged its feet on implementation and enforcement of existing sanctions, and could potentially become a more active spoiler, making life easier for North Korea’s procurement networks. If other UN members recognise that Russia is openly violating sanctions with few repercussions, this could cause other states – many in the Global South are already struggling to implement the resolutions – to ignore sanctions evasion activity on a greater scale. Given that these are not technology supplier states, this may have a limited effect on North Korea’s illicit procurement, but some of these states are well suited to act as third-country transhipment or re-export hubs, which could provide new opportunities for North Korea’s procurement networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolving-networks&quot;&gt;Evolving Networks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entities and geography of North Korea’s overseas networks will continue to evolve in a broader sense. The recent decision by North Korea to close around a quarter of its overseas diplomatic missions is an example. As noted above, a 2019 PoE report also noted that the number of procurement operatives overseas was declining. Given the core of North Korea’s procurement networks is already focused on Russia and China, these mission closures are more likely to affect broader sanctions-busting efforts, rather than procurement. However, some of the specific missions closing – such as the one in Hong Kong – could have an important impact on procurement operations. The genesis of the closure of so many missions is unclear, but likely reflects the declining benefits of such a network for sanctions busting, the risks posed by defections and foreign intelligence monitoring, and North Korea’s risk aversion. It also may reflect newer remote-work models of sanctions busting, for example earning revenue through IT labourers or cryptocurrency hacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together these potential developments suggest that North Korea’s procurement networks will continue to shop for a wide range of technologies, and likely in a more permissive environment. If the UN sanctions regime continues to weaken, a more focused effort to prevent procurement will be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite successes in its nuclear and missile programmes over the past few years, North Korea still relies on external sources of technology to supply its weapons programmes. Judging by its own technology trajectory and other proliferation cases, it will continue to do so in the long term. Over the past decades, procurement networks with tentacles all around the world have been used by North Korea to obtain technology from willing exporters and naive businesses, and through duping those trying to comply with export controls. These networks will continue to be key to the sustainment of North Korea’s programmes and further technological progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has analysed North Korea’s procurement networks, particularly in light of the successes of the country’s nuclear and missile programmes, and recent geopolitical shifts relating to Russia’s relationship with North Korea in terms of the war in Ukraine. It has drawn on underexploited source material to provide an overview of North Korea’s procurement networks, focusing on the past five years. The paper has found that North Korea’s networks have been highly active, and this is likely to continue as they seek to make up for the slowdown in procurement during the Covid-19-related border closures, and to compensate for goods used in recent Russian orders for missile technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s procurement networks are largely focused on China and Russia. In these jurisdictions, North Korea’s operatives – trading company personnel, diplomats, intelligence officers, and scientists and researchers – have been able to operate with relative impunity and establish supply chains for a growing number of requisite technologies. However, there are still some requirements that see North Korea looking to manufacturers in the US, Europe, Japan and other markets to fulfil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changing dynamic in North Korea’s renewed relationship with Russia is perhaps the most important factor that will shape the future of North Korea’s procurement networks. If Moscow were to formally offer strategic technologies to Pyongyang, or to allow North Korea’s operatives to openly shop on a larger scale from Russian providers, this could be bountiful for North Korea’s procurement needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other factors will also shape the nature of North Korea’s networks into the future, including evolving procurement needs and greater requirements for highly specialised technologies from a smaller number of niche suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the paper concludes that despite North Korea’s successes, there remains value in seeking to prevent access to, and procurement of, technology (see Box 1). Given this, the paper provides 10 recommendations for those seeking to counter North Korea’s illicit procurement, including government officials, staff at international organisations and researchers outside government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Continue to hone export controls in the West and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export controls clearly have value, even if they do not prevent all transfers. Resurgent interest in export controls to prevent technology transfer to China and Russia could provide opportunities to identify and build on synergies, particularly given that China and Russia are the two most prominent “third countries” where North Korea’s procurement networks operate. North Korea also clearly relies on many of the same sectors to supply its programmes, including potential overlaps in challenging areas such as microelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Continue to build supply-side relationships&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export controls are more effective if a wider range of states agree to implement them. Since February 2022, the US and key partners have built a coalition to implement sanctions against Russia. North Korea should also be factored into this coalition-building, especially given Pyongyang’s growing relationship with Russia. Other forums may also be useful in this context. Regarding Iran, an October 2023 joint statement on ballistic missile activities was released by the US and a group of “Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI)-endorsing states” the same day that restrictions under UNSC 2231 expired. Forums such as the PSI may provide opportunities for coordination, given that Russia is a member of other forums where illicit procurement is discussed, such as the NSG and the MTCR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Replace the dissolved UN PoE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demise of the UN PoE in April 2024 was a blow for the sanctions regime. However, the PoE’s reports were also heavily constrained by the Russian and Chinese panel members. For example, the 2024 report has minimal references to the recent large-scale arms and missile transfers from North Korea to Russia, which were in breach of the arms embargo. A new body needs to replace the PoE and continue its role in investigating breaches of sanctions and putting valuable information into the public domain. A spectrum of options is available, each with pros and cons. Key trade-offs in any solution will need to be balanced between a broad, official – and likely constrained – UN body with greater powers to solicit information and legitimacy, perhaps through a UN General Assembly monitoring arrangement, and an unofficial body outside the UN with greater freedom and less legitimacy. Other non-UN forums could also form the basis of an effort, for example the G7 or the PSI, although each will bring its own challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Apply open source intelligence to procurement networks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of North Korea’s illicit networks have either been uncovered or knowledge of them has been expanded by open source intelligence. This has been used by the PoE, as well as non-governmental organisations, think tanks and academia. Most recently, open sources have shed light on Russian arms purchases from North Korea. Further resources should be devoted to ongoing open source efforts to explore North Korea’s trading networks, particularly those in China and Russia, as well as connections to its remaining diplomatic networks. Business-to-business websites have provided insights into North Korea’s nuclear marketing activities in the past and may also provide insights into procurement. More resources should be dedicated to ongoing efforts and starting new efforts, potentially in conjunction with a body replacing the PoE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Continue UN sanctions outreach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outreach on UN sanctions by the US and partners should continue, to ensure that third countries see the importance these states continue to place on a North Korea sanctions regime. This should include outreach on broader sanctions issues, as well as illicit procurement and proliferation finance. Funding states should work together to coordinate their outreach efforts to ensure maximum efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Employ new tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New tools should be used to complement this outreach. These include those collating the insights of open source investigation and understanding the entities involved in North Korea’s networks and their corporate structures. This would allow governments to better dig into cases, and the private sector to conduct due diligence and understand their risk exposure. RUSI’s DPRK Reports Database, which collates data on entities from the PoE reports in a structured way – previously unavailable outside the near 6,000 pages of the PoE reports – is an example of an innovative solution that can have real-world benefits for governments, the private sector and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Engage “chokepoint” manufacturers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the debatable utility of the “chokepoint” terminology, the evidence suggests that North Korea does still seek certain items from outside China and Russia. This likely includes certain types of machine tools, and extensive microelectronics. There is much to gain from continuing to engage the private sector, from raising awareness, helping to understand procurement methods and identifying suspicious enquiries. This engagement could also be undertaken jointly on issues related to North Korean, Russian, Iranian and even Chinese illicit procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Engage softer targets on cyber security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National governments should make efforts to engage softer targets, such as start-ups, research institutions and universities, that hold sensitive information, particularly about emerging technologies that North Korea is pursuing, on the threat posed by North Korea’s cyber efforts and relevant cyber-security measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Challenge the North Korea–Russia relationship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burgeoning relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang poses a significant proliferation risk, given Russia’s technology capability and need for weapons and materiel. Russia, and previously the Soviet Union, have historically played a role in nonproliferation efforts, so the willingness to provide North Korea with any technology it requests should not be assumed. North Korea also needs other, more benign, commodities, such as food and fertiliser, as well as strategic technology, so technology transfers are not a given. In view of this, there may be opportunities for quid pro quos with Russia to limit the transfer of nuclear and missile technologies to North Korea – although this is unlikely. Furthermore, the issue of Russia–North Korea bilateral strategic trade could be linked, for example, to potential South Korean provision of missile systems to Ukraine for use against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Consider further use of extraterritorial tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US, and to a lesser degree its partners, should consider the use of other extraterritorial tools that have been developed and tested on a handful of nodes in WMD-related procurement networks in China and Russia. However, careful consideration should be made regarding possible political and diplomatic blowback.&lt;/p&gt;

However, it is critical to develop and buy the right equipment due to extremely tight defence budget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheap, widely available equipment, from drones to laptops propagating viruses, present asymmetric opportunities to terrorists. At the same time, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has restored the threat of peer-on-peer warfare. A range of new technologies, from cyber to artificial intelligence to biological weaponry and, soon, quantum computing, threaten a sudden leap forward in conventional warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This matters, as an example from as far back as 1982 reminds us. In an attack on Syrian surface-to-air missile sites in the Beqaa Valley, the Israeli Air Force destroyed all 19 sites, together with an astonishing 64 Syrian fighters, without a single loss. With aerodynamically comparable aircraft – and highly motivated pilots – on both sides, it was a single Hawkeye airborne early warning and control system and superior avionics which turned a battle into a turkey shoot. Yet today’s attrition rates in Ukraine emphasise the importance of quantity as well as quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acquisition reform is critical, but also a well-trodden area of discussion. While improving defence procurement is a classic “wicked problem” with no easy solutions, we believe there are two areas that the new government needs to focus on. The first is how requirements are generated, and what organisational reforms can improve this process. The second is supply chain management, to enable the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to take advantage of the innovation ecosystem that the UK has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defining-procurement-requirements&quot;&gt;Defining Procurement Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bernard Gray’s seminal report of 2009 on defence procurement had a major impact on the operation of Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;amp;S), the sharp end of defence procurement, and he was subsequently put in charge of that organisation. But Gray also had some trenchant analysis on the confused arrangements by which elements of the MoD acted as the “customer” for DE&amp;amp;S. He recommended:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a) DCDS(Capability) to be responsible for the creation and control of requirements, and required to control the budget of the agreed EP as a single point of MoD contact with DE&amp;amp;S for equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;b) Clear ownership of each project/requirement to be allocated to a single individual within DCDS(Capability) team, including business case formulation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The average timeline and onerousness of MoD procurement rules out a large proportion of companies with which Defence would benefit from engaging&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 1980s, when the UK produced world-class equipment across many categories, the operational requirements branch of each service (as capability directorates were then called) had a cross-section of military officers. These branches included the head at each level, scientists, engineers and finance staff and – crucially – controlled their own budgets, up to certain limits. Ironically, the same period when the sharp end of procurement was greatly improved through the Levene Reforms, with the setting up of the Procurement Executive (now DE&amp;amp;S), the highly effective operational requirements branches, which acted as the “supervising customers” for the Procurement Executive and its predecessor organisations were broken up. In the quotation above, Gray effectively recommended the reintroduction of that original structure for operational requirements. This was ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A complication was that Lord Levene’s second batch of reforms in 2011 involved delegating more powers to the four relevant top-level budget-holders (TLBs) – the Royal Navy, the Army, RAF and StratCom – but each simply took over its share of each central function, capability, technical and financial, replicating the same stove pipe approach with military, technical and financial staff brigaded separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, each capability function continues to be composed almost entirely of uniformed staff, commissioning work from scientists and engineers concentrated in the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), or in a separate part of their individual service branches, while the budget and – crucially – the authority to spend is held by a third body, such as, in the case of the Army, D Resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of innovation units has been set up in each of the four TLBs, starting with JHub in StratCom. Early evidence is that these are getting some small projects from conception to fruition with commendable speed. Helping to take forward their work, and innovation more generally, is the Defence and Security Accelerator. These innovation hubs seem to be structured and to operate in a remarkably similar fashion to the old cross-disciplinary operational requirements branches, but they are effectively operating in parallel with the main capability departments; it would seem to make more sense to fix those structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists from DSTL and the individual services, and relevant financial staff, should be reintegrated, and authority returned for smaller projects. This should empower and motivate staffs, and having technical capability in-house and part of each team’s culture should temper any temptation to go for the first shiny offering from an existing contractor. A further point is that all the uniformed officers are regulars, so there is only reserve input when they choose to ask for it. We believe that this has two serious disadvantages. First, reservists may identify opportunities early in the process of designing a capability so as to make it easier to integrate citizen elements – as the Russians did with the simple and robust T34C, and the Germans failed to do with their excellent but over-complex Panzers. Second, civilians often bring knowledge of civilian tech alternatives (from simulation, to communications, to the software lifecycle) more advanced than military equivalents. So reservist officers should be included in the capability function, on the usual part-time basis as on other staffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area where the MoD has made remarkable progress is breaking down the traditional structures by which personnel train and upskilled. PUBLIC delivered an innovation programme called the Percy Hobart Fellowship, where Royal Navy personnel were exposed to business, digital, and innovation skills, provided a short secondment into a technology startup, and asked to develop an innovation project predicated around a problem that they had experienced. One of these, the development of a mobile onboard operating theatre, has been taken into the formal procurement process, and is projected to save the Royal Navy £8 million per year against the retrofitting of a standard ship’s medical centre. Although a small example in the grand scheme of defence spending, this illustrates that an empowered individual, with the support of a cross-functional team, can develop requirements that help the MoD buy fit-for-purpose equipment that saves money and delivers what is required to the warfighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also shows that, in the upstream identification of requirements, key MoD decision-makers would benefit from secondments and a general exposure to the innovation, science, and technology world outside Defence. The MoD should provide additional structures and opportunities to encourage networking and knowledge-sharing across different units within Defence, leading to a diffusion of ideas and cooperative networks that can help drive better requirement development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;broadening-the-supply-chain&quot;&gt;Broadening the Supply Chain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A consistent concern that arises from both defence suppliers and investors is the so-called “valley of death”: the gap between the capital available for small-scale pilots and the funding required to develop a production-ready capability. As a result, defence technology is largely seen as an un-investable market for start-ups, given the level of risk capital required to build the competition and supply chain needed to deliver benefits to MoD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few factors drive this. The first is the disappointing level of market engagement with a diverse set of suppliers. This is partly caused by strict rules around market engagement, many of them rolled over from EU regulations. However, efforts such as Digital Exploitation for Defence (DX4D) aim to increase the touchpoints with digital solution providers. This is important because the best solutions to a problem have often been identified in adjacent markets. Let us not forget that the genesis of Silicon Valley was the defence industry, with Hewlett Packard selling microprocessors to the US Navy. Hewlett Packard selling audio oscillators to the US military To truly take advantage of dual-use technologies and bring a more diverse set of suppliers into the defence market, the MoD must look to expand its market engagement activities beyond the typical avenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second factor is the length of procurement timelines for defence. Particularly for specific technology or software applications, as opposed to platforms, the average timeline and onerousness of MoD procurement rules out a large proportion of companies with which Defence would benefit from engaging. The MoD announced in July 2023 that it intends to reduce the maximum timeline for digital acquisition programmes to three years. However, this remains well outside the typical lifespan of a typical early-stage digital start-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to the procurement length is the typical size and structure of MoD procurements. The fact that requirements all too often focus on platforms rather than the weapons and capabilities they carry often means that the MoD misses out on applications, tooling or software that might impact specific, well understood opportunities. This leads to a disproportionate amount of spend going through prime contractors. 2022/2023 MoD spend with SMEs totalled only 5%, well below central government’s target of 25%, which shows the degree to which primes and large businesses dominate this market. This compares to 25% of prime contracting value for the US Department of Defence going to SMEs in 2022. While primes have SMEs and innovative businesses in their supply chains, UK primes are under no obligation to produce figures around how much spend makes its way to SMEs. That power differential is felt by companies in Defence; many start-ups in this space report a reticence to engage with primes because of their ability to dictate terms around important issues, such as intellectual property ownership and transfer of risk, that are disadvantageous or even threatening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if we want to bring greater diversity, competition, and therefore quality into defence supply chains, we must incentivise the risk capital required to scale disruptive digital and technology businesses. Equity investing in defence companies in the UK from 2021–2023 was 0.6% of that in the US. Investors note the availability of small funding sources for pilots, as well as later stage private equity, but a lack of venture investment in mid-tier funding to carry promising businesses through that “valley of death” to implementation. Therefore, the current route to market is to sell early to a prime, or hopefully gain enough traction in adjacent markets that the challenges mentioned above can be mitigated. This is not an effective way of stimulating a market that delivers good value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;By reshaping the formulation of requirements and the cultivation of the defence supply chain, the UK could bring British innovation back into the heart of its armed forces&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several approaches that the MoD can adopt to address these challenges. There should be central guidance to dramatically increase the pace of acquisition for digital programmes. One approach is to use a procurement method known as a Challenge Programme, which allows departments to demonstrate multiple solutions around a particular problem space, allowing them to see what the market has to offer and create a clear pathway to procurement for successful suppliers. The Home Office Accelerated Capability Environment has been a successful example of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase the clarity and attractiveness of the defence market to start-ups and innovative SMEs, we would like to see greater pre-market engagement, accompanied by a genuine dialogue with the proposed reconstituted integrated capability staffs, to help define requirements and detailed specifications. Primes should be required to make public their spend with SMEs. This will both make the attractiveness of the market clear, and help government hold these suppliers to account for SME spend targets. A greater effort to break down platform procurements into smaller lots would attract more businesses and increase competition and value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have seen positive efforts from NATO’s DIANA accelerator programme to create not only funding, but also paths to market for leading defence startups. But this is not enough if we want to build a world-beating domestic defence innovation ecosystem. Investors need to be brought into the dialogue to understand and feed into MoD priorities, changing the rules of market engagement where necessary. This would provide valuable insight on the state of the art technologically for government, as well as where spending priorities are for the MoD. A funding mechanism, possibly following structures pioneered by the Enterprise Capital Funds programme at the British Business Bank, to incentivise the creation of funds that focus on mid-stage rather than early-stage growth would go a step further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK used to be a shining example of innovation across the G7 and NATO, from Frank Whittle and Percy Hobart to Alan Turing. There are still points of light, like today’s Government Digital Service. Our warfighters and defence staff deserve the very best that the market has to offer. By reshaping the formulation of requirements and the cultivation of the defence supply chain, the UK could bring British innovation back into the heart of its armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last two years, warfare at sea has been conducted at a higher level of intensity than has been seen for decades. The conflict in Ukraine, in which the Russian Black Sea Fleet was rendered “functionally inactive” by a country without a surface fleet, and the ongoing battle in the Red Sea have provided analysts and practitioners of naval warfare with a wealth of empirical evidence. It is thus germane to consider what lessons the Royal Navy might draw from these conflicts as the force continues a process of recapitalisation which will extend into the 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-anti-accessarea-denial-threat-a-challenge-to-be-contextualised&quot;&gt;The Anti-Access/Area Denial Threat: A Challenge to be Contextualised&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remarkable success enjoyed by an overmatched Ukrainian Navy and the country’s security service against Russia’s Black Sea Fleet has, understandably, led some to ponder the question of whether we are approaching a tipping point in the conduct of warfare at sea. The ability of the Ukrainians to combine anti-ship cruise missiles, uncrewed surface vessels and land attack missiles such as Storm Shadow into a layered anti-access area denial threat that has partially forced the Russian Navy out of Sevastopol raises important questions regarding the risks which surface vessels face, particularly in confined waters. The proliferation of these capabilities, many of which are now employed by weaker states and indeed non-state actors, will mean that what would have been largely uncontested deployments at sea in the past will involve contested theatre entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, claims regarding the risk to surface combatants themselves should be scrutinised. In the Black Sea, despite high losses in aggregate, the Russian fleet has not endured a historically high loss rate. Over the course of the two and a half year conflict, Russia has lost 22 vessels, which amounts to a loss rate of 0.03 per 100 ship days in theatre. For reference, the US loss rate against Japanese Kamikazes off Okinawa was roughly 0.2 per 100 ship days (with vessels sustaining damaging hits at a rate of 0.44 per 100 ship days), and the UK task force in the Falklands endured 1.35 damaging hits per 100 ship days – despite which both navies prevailed. In effect, then, it is not clear that the vulnerability of vessels to the anti-access threats of yesteryear, be they crewed suicide aircraft or Exocet missiles, was less acute than is the case now. The importance of not overstating the risks to surface vessels has been reinforced in the Red Sea, where the Houthis have thus far failed to successfully engage a coalition surface combatant and where UK and US vessels have enjoyed tactical successes against complex salvos incorporating capabilities such as C-802 anti-ship missiles, Samad-3 UAVs and Asef anti-ship ballistic missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, a limited loss rate can have crippling cumulative effects on a fleet over time, as it has had on the Russian Navy. This is true of all forces, but the risk is especially acute in maritime warfare as vessels are increasingly difficult to replace. This in many ways reinforces a classical principle: if a navy has a choice between seeking decision early (even at some risk to its forces) or conserving capability, it should generally opt for the former option. A conservative approach creates false efficiencies, reducing loss rates at any given time but raising the risks of a long war which many navies may not be able to sustain, irrespective of how low they can keep their loss rates. Of course, a navy cannot always force a decision in war – in truth, there was no way the Russian navy could have shortened the conflict. However, its losses in a long war still reinforce the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If a navy has a choice between seeking decision early (even at some risk to its forces) or conserving capability, it should generally opt for the former option&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in both the Black Sea and the Red Sea large surface combatants have been relatively safe, the same cannot be said for less heavily armed vessels and the fixed infrastructure that supports the fleet. Many of Ukraine’s successes have been achieved against platforms such as the Ropucha-class landing ship (which serves as a logistical workhorse for the Russian army) as well as minesweepers and patrol boats. In the Red Sea, the Houthis have enjoyed a comparatively high hit rate against merchant shipping. While warships themselves may not be more vulnerable, the threat that anti-access systems pose will be most acute for the lightly armed (or unarmed) oilers and solid support vessels that enable the Royal Navy’s operations. The effect of this will be significant when limited numbers of support vessels are available. Additionally, while tasks such as mine countermeasures have always had to be conducted under some risk of an air threat, the UK’s (Royal Fleet Auxiliary-operated) mine countermeasures vessels will face an increasingly multilayered anti-access challenge, incentivising uncrewed solutions which can be employed from greater distances and multiple vessel types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixed infrastructure has also proven vulnerable even under optimal conditions. The ability of Ukraine’s armed forces to progressively target both vessels and structures in Sevastopol, which is defended by a robust integrated air defence system, illustrates that over time even relatively well-defended fixed bastions will be challenged by cruise and ballistic missiles, among other threats. For the UK, home ports such as Portsmouth are relatively safe. In the absence of a Russian intermediate-range ballistic threat, the primary threat is posed by cruise missiles, which – if launched from the eastern flank – would have to traverse a considerable amount of territory. There is a real threat posed by cruise missiles launched from Russian bombers, surface vessels and submarines from the northern flank, although even in this case, once an Allied maritime component command is stood up, the vulnerability could only be exploited if Russia was willing to risk losing key strategic assets. At home, the risk is likely to be most acute in the early stages of a conflict. That said, key seaports of disembarkation on which elements of the Royal Navy (and the wider UK joint force) would depend in an expeditionary context are far more vulnerable by dint of proximity to likely theatres of combat. Examples include Duqm in Oman and Gothenburg in Sweden. The latter, as Scandinavia’s largest port, has been an important logistical lynchpin of exercises such as Trident Juncture, which included the Royal Navy and Marines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way in which Russia had to eventually defend Sevastopol with not just air defences but also helicopters and barriers (to respectively slow and engage UAVs) also carries more tactical lessons. Of note is the important role played by Russian helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft against unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), which are able to remain below a surface vessel’s radar horizon for extended periods, but which are vulnerable to air attack. This could have ramifications for the Royal Navy’s Merlin and Wildcat fleet, which will also be needed to support other functions such as anti-submarine warfare (ASW), among other tasks. The addition of roles for an already stretched helicopter force might be avoided through the use of autonomous systems, and engaging surface targets in clutter may be an area where machine learning and computer vision – as well as the non-lethality of the engagement – can allow autonomy to be exploited quickly (as contrasted with more complex tasks such as ASW).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk to logistical nodes will reinforce another challenge: the difficulty of achieving magazine depth. This is partially a function of cost, since interceptors such as the Aster-15 and 30 cost much more than many of the missiles they may have to intercept. It is also, however, a function of the fact that vertical launching systems (VLS) cannot be safely replenished at sea in even moderate sea states. The likelihood that vessels will expend their VLS loadout, coupled with a risk to any allied or sovereign forward bases on which they may have planned to rely, could – in extremis – force the rotation of Royal Navy vessels to home ports, significantly impacting their operational tempo. Fleet sustainment, rather than protection, may be the biggest challenge in contested theatres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final notable feature in both the Black and Red Sea has been the role of third-party ISR provision. While the extent of the Allied role in providing ISR to Ukraine in the Black Sea cannot be known, it is understood that the US is providing data from space-based ISR to Ukraine 32 times per day, and that Western surveillance platforms have conducted patrols over the Black Sea. In the Red Sea, Iranian special-purpose vessels such as the Behshad have provided cueing to Houthi missile batteries ashore, a role also performed by the Iranian vessel Saviz during the Saudi-led coalition’s campaign. A sub-peer opponent backed by a state source of adversary ISR that cannot be targeted for political reasons will pose a challenge to many concepts for countering anti-access/area denial (A2AD) which depend on destroying or crippling an opponent’s sensors (which may not be an option in indirect conflict). A range of options of varying complexity and risk – from jamming and cyber attacks to covert sabotage (likely conducted against the Saviz by Israel) – are available to navies, but the risks and costs of these options need to be weighed ahead of time as do the cross-service and cross-government dependencies they create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-regarding-the-pacing-opponent&quot;&gt;Lessons Regarding the Pacing Opponent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two conflicts have also illustrated a number of things about putative opponents that the Royal Navy may face, most notably Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s failures in engaging dynamic targets at sea over the course of the Ukraine conflict have been considerable. To use one example, the Russian navy and air force failed to fix and engage the Ukrainian navy’s last surface vessel – the Yuriy Olefirenko – for months, even when it was deployed at relatively close proximity to Kherson to provide naval gunfire support. The inability to engage the vessel at sea (it was eventually sunk in port), despite Russia enjoying air and naval superiority in the Black Sea during 2022, would appear illustrative of broader problems with aggregating data from multiple sensors and tasking platforms dynamically. This may reflect challenges in the stated desire to aggregate information from multiple service branches without reaching back to a higher headquarters or involving multiple separate command chains. While the failure to track a relatively conspicuous amphibious vessel was likely a failure of organisational structures rather than sensors, Russia will struggle in the latter regard as well. Though it aspired to replace the Soviet-era Tselina and Legenda constellations with a robust network of Pion-NK, Lotos and Persona satellites equipped with ELINT, COMINT and EO sensors, it had by 2021 launched only one Pion-NKS satellite, and fields a very limited EO capability. In the absence of a space-based ISR capability, Russia’s ability to track dynamic targets at long distances (except through very non-granular tools such as the Polsodnukh-E OTH radar) will be limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the methods which NATO has used to employ maritime power as an asymmetrical competitive tool vis Russia – including the deployment of ELINT spoofing on islets in the Aegean during the Haystack exercises and Ocean Venture, which saw emissions-dark carrier operations in Norway (where terrain added an additional layer of complexity to air-based tracking) – may be tactically feasible vis a Russia that does not employ the sophisticated A2AD capability that China does. Towards the end of the Cold War, an inability to perform dynamic tracking led the commander of the Soviet Northern Fleet to request a trebling of his budget, and was a major factor in Soviet assessments of the conventional balance. This is, in principle, good news for a Royal Navy that will be built around aircraft carriers for the foreseeable future. However, the ability to perform these actions during the Cold War depended in great measure on US aircraft carriers and was, moreover, a product of sustained training in complex waters such as those on the Norwegian coastline where operating large vessels requires considerable skill. Any European effort to replicate this (of which the Royal Navy could be an important part) would need to account for fewer available US capabilities in the event that the Indo-Pacific absorbs more capacity. Munitions sustainment and enablement will have to be accounted for, particularly given the small numbers of munitions capable of suppression of enemy air defences, such as SPEAR-3, that are likely to be available. In effect, then, Cold War concepts for employing forces forward to impose multiple dilemmas on a continental power remain tactically valid, but this will only be true if they can be resourced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Many of the challenges of greatest significance relate to generating the capacity to leverage existing capabilities and competencies effectively&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major lesson regarding the Russian navy as an opponent, which became particularly stark after the loss of the Moskva, is that the Russian navy is designed to have strategic effects from relative proximity to its ports. From positions in Crimea, the Russian fleet – which is the only service equipped with the 3M-14 Kalibr cruise missile – has been a key component in Russia’s strike campaign against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure which is fixed and easier for Russia to target with complex salvos. Ukraine has progressively degraded this threat, but at a likely considerable cost in missiles. While it is not known exactly how many Storm Shadow/SCALP and Neptune missiles have been used against Russian ports, it is understood that 300 missiles were provided to Ukraine and that striking the Black Sea Fleet was a priority line of effort for Ukraine’s strike campaign. Moreover, each reported cruise missile strike appears to have been preceded by days of attacks using UAVs, possibly alongside other shaping activity. For navies such as the Royal Navy (and indeed the UK joint force), the challenge is not that sinking the Russian surface fleet will be inherently difficult, but rather that if the fleet opts to launch cruise missiles against civilian infrastructure from positions close to air defence networks in Kaliningrad and the northern bastion, there will be a political demand to engage it (irrespective of the military value of doing so) and the task will be a burden in terms of both planning and munitions expended. Given the likely demand for standoff munitions elsewhere in the theatre, this is of importance. Surface strike, then, is a priority line of effort even if the Russian surface fleet is a decrepit force. The requirement to engage targets within well-defended bastions while accounting for limited VLS capacity into the 2030s, even after vessels such as the Type 26 and Type 31 enter service, will make it of particular importance that weapons such as FC/ASW are able to achieve a high Single Shot Probability of Kill in defended airspace, since the smaller a salvo, the more important penetration and successful engagement becomes. Though Russia’s nuclear-powered submarines are its most potent capability, the Russian naval threat is not just a submarine threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflicts in the Red Sea and Black Sea carry a number of important lessons which might inform the Royal Navy’s efforts to generate its future fleet. In many ways, the technological dimensions of these conflicts – though the most heavily studied – have been less important than the fundamental lessons that they carry regarding how a fleet must structure and prioritise tasks to prepare for major contingencies. The lessons learned from these conflicts, then, have an evolutionary quality where many of the challenges of greatest significance relate to generating the capacity to leverage existing capabilities and competencies effectively. Technology can be an important enabler in this regard, but is not a solution in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, Jordan is rarely spoken about in politics or in the media as much more than an anchor of stability in an increasingly fragmented Levant region. To its north lies southern Syria, where Assad has managed to wrestle back nominal control of provinces by striking deals with warlords who collect rent from drugs production. Iraq and Lebanon, two of Jordan’s close neighbours, are captured states, where non-state actors supported by Iran have taken control, and strengthen their grip on power every day through normalising corruption and dispensing patronage to their supporters. To Jordan’s west are the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Israel, where Israel’s war on Gaza continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan, in comparison, maintains an air of stability, with a stable monarchy and democratic elections. Despite this, Jordan is in a uniquely difficult position due to instability caused by Israel’s war in Gaza and the worsening economic conditions within the Kingdom. Before the 7 October attack, Jordan already struggled with high unemployment, particularly among young people (aged 15–24), at over 40%. Since the conflict began, this problem has been exacerbated by a catastrophic drop in tourism and trade. Tour guides and tourist businesspeople this author spoke to reported almost endemic booking cancellations, with no promise of future work. Jordan’s economic model relies heavily on tourism, and the collapse of that market leaves thousands more unemployed or without income. Jordan’s economy also relies on foreign aid and support, much of which comes from multilateral institutions such as the UN. The withdrawal of US support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) is a sobering prospect for Jordanian policymakers, who rely on the work of UNRWA to support the two million registered Palestinian refugees currently in Jordan. In this way, UNRWA, UNHCR and the myriad NGOs within Jordan cover gaps in welfare that the Jordanian civil service simply does not have the money or capacity to provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socially, Jordan is in similar disarray. There have been almost daily protests in Amman and other major cities regarding the country’s close relationship with Israel. There have also been specific cases where protestors have targeted government buildings, a recent example being a protest attempting to storm the Israeli embassy in March 2024. At the heart of these protests is the long-established Palestinian community. Palestinians make up over half of the Jordanian population, and feel frustrated that Jordan continues to cooperate with Israel politically and militarily. Particularly incendiary was Jordan’s participation in the Middle East Air Defence Alliance response to Iran’s strikes on Israel in April 2024. The Jordanian foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, replied to accusations by explaining that the motivation was simply to defend Jordanian airspace, but many within Jordan continue to interpret the intervention as a stance in defence of Israel. In an era of unprecedented social media use, Jordanians are consistently confronted with harrowing images and videos from inside Gaza, further inflaming tensions. Antisemitism is also widespread in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As a pivotal UK ally in the region, Jordan and its stability should be of paramount concern for UK policymakers&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existence of an anti-Israeli sentiment in Jordan or the wider Middle East is hardly a novel phenomenon, and neither is Jordan relying on foreign aid to stave off economic collapse. However, the region’s fragmentation brings a set of novel and unique challenges to Jordan. One of these challenges is that Iran and its proxies are increasingly identifying Jordan as a potential vector for their shadow war with Israel and the West. Iran has excelled in its policy of establishing a network of dissident groups across the region, whether in Lebanon with Hezbollah, Iraq with Shiite Militia Groups, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen or Polisario in the Maghreb. Iran has continued this opportunistic support of groups in Jordan. Examples of this include weapons- and drugs-smuggling across the vast Iraqi and Syrian borders; hacking support targeting the Jordanian government; rhetorical support of dissident groups; and criticism of the monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an era of increased great power competition, Keir Starmer and his ministers have stressed at every opportunity that their focus and priority is European security. While the UK has clear economic and energy security dependencies on the Gulf, the same is not true of the Levant region. It is clear that there is very unlikely to be new funding from the UK in the region, and we can also rule out interventionism of the kind we saw under past Labour governments, as the US looks set to concentrate resources around China. The combination of a lack of resources and the fact that what limited resources are available are focused on Europe leaves UK policy on the region at an inflection point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;securing-jordan-actions-for-the-uk-and-international-partners&quot;&gt;Securing Jordan: Actions for the UK and International Partners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan’s long-term economic weakness, coupled with an increasingly fragmented regional security landscape, poses an increasing threat to the only stable country in the Levant. As a pivotal UK ally in the region, Jordan and its stability should be of paramount concern for UK policymakers. A weak Levant region directly impacts the UK through migrationary pressures, the export of terrorism, and the disruption of key supply lines and international trade. So what can the UK and its allies do to mitigate Jordan’s instability and support Jordanians in their struggle for a better future?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, ending the conflict in Gaza would significantly alleviate pressure on Jordan. David Lammy began his tenure as Foreign Secretary by correctly pointing out that the UK has limited influence in bringing this about, then visited Israel, and the OPT, and called for an immediate ceasefire. Realistically, the UK has very limited scope for unilaterally bringing about an immediate ceasefire, though Lammy may feel that calling for one will begin to tip the pressure dial in Washington. The UK government should instead concentrate on supporting the US in its negotiating efforts and ensuring that post-conflict initiatives include steps towards establishing a Palestinian state. Still, while the UK has limited prospects for singlehandedly bringing about an immediate ceasefire, it has enduring credibility that can be leveraged with future Israeli governments. UK officials should emphasise to future Israeli governments the dangers of allowing internal political struggles to lead to breaches of conventions regarding the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and settler activity in the West Bank. Additionally, the UK should maintain and expand its policy of identifying and sanctioning those involved in illegal settler activities in the West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the UK must persist in providing direct support to Jordan, particularly through government projects aimed at capacity building. Historically, UK spending in Jordan has largely been directed towards military training and democratisation. A shift in focus towards enhancing the capabilities of increasingly strained Jordanian government departments is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the UK should advocate for sustained regional and international support for Jordan. This includes ensuring the continued operation of multilateral aid agencies in Jordan, especially given the critical gaps left by the US withdrawal of support for UN organisations like UNRWA and UNESCO. If direct economic aid from the UK is not feasible, diplomatic efforts in the Gulf should prioritise generating and coordinating regional aid for Jordan. This could include bilateral aid packages as well as multilateral regional and international agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Jordan stands at a critical juncture amid regional turmoil, grappling with economic fragility exacerbated by external conflicts and internal dissent&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the UK should engage in regional and international discussions on addressing Iran’s influence. Since the collapse of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action – otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal – there has been a lack of coherent strategy, contributing to tensions on the Israel–Lebanon border, the security vacuum in Yemen, and instability in Iraq. Acknowledging this issue is crucial for any UK efforts aimed at regional stability. The new government should prioritise convening and supporting regional initiatives, in collaboration with the US and European allies, to prevent Iran from perpetuating instability. Iran’s threat to regional peace and security must be taken seriously and acknowledged for what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan stands at a critical juncture amid regional turmoil, grappling with economic fragility exacerbated by external conflicts and internal dissent. The country’s stability remains pivotal for the broader Levant region, making it imperative for the UK and its allies to take proactive measures. Addressing the conflict in Gaza, advocating for Palestinian statehood, and maintaining diplomatic pressure on Israel are immediate steps, but the UK government needs to delineate a coherent strategy. While Jordan currently outperforms its troubled neighbours, complacency will not ensure sustained stability unless proactive measures are taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，控方早前舉證完畢，辯方昨日作中段陳詞，要求法庭就黎面對的3項控罪裁定表證不成立。3名國安法指定法官今（25日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）宣布，裁定黎所面對的3項控罪表證成立，需要答辯。經30分鐘休庭，辯方指給予法律意見後，黎選擇親自作供，另擬傳召一名專家證人就社交軟件 Signal 作供。由於3名法官在8至10月均有其他案件要處理，未能立即聽取黎的證供。經商討後，最終押後至11月20日續審，屆時黎將出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3罪表證成立-黎智英選擇親自作供&quot;&gt;3罪表證成立 黎智英選擇親自作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首被告黎智英（76歲）由懲教人員押解往法院應訊。法官杜麗冰宣布，黎所面對的3項控罪均表證成立，需要答辯。辯方隨即申請休庭30分鐘以向黎索取法律指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;再次開庭之後，辯方代表、資深大律師彭耀鴻指，已給予黎法律意見，而黎選擇在本案親自作供。另外，辯方擬傳召一名專家證人，就社交軟件 Signal 作供，預料證供內容圍繞技術層面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3法官均另有案件處理-控辯雙方商討後-押後至11月&quot;&gt;3法官均另有案件處理 控辯雙方商討後 押後至11月&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰指，就時間而言，法官李運騰下周有個人事務，難以出席本案；另外，3名法官在8月有其他案件要審理，直至8月29日之前都未能處理本案。至於10月，法官杜麗冰表示有一宗高院案件需要續審，料需時3星期，而該案已經押後多時，不能再調動。法官李運騰則關注，黎已還柙一段時間，案件應盡快續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及黎智英的證供需時多久。辯方指，預計主問需時5日。法官李運騰聞言則指，本案涉及文章數量眾多，預料控方會以雙倍時間作盤問，因此主問連同盤問應該合共需時3至4星期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;經休庭商討，控辯雙方最早可以出席續審的日子為今年11月20日，這樣黎作供可以一氣呵成，而毋須打斷。辯方表示，辯方案情需時約30個工作天。最終法官杜麗冰押後至11月20日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方中段陳詞黎網上節目提及制裁-不等於呼籲外國制裁&quot;&gt;辯方中段陳詞：黎網上節目提及制裁 不等於呼籲外國制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就串謀發布煽動刊物罪，辯方的中段陳詞指，涉案報導和評論牽涉公眾利益，發布僅為了引起公眾關注，這是一般報紙本來就會做的工作，而且言論和新聞自由均受憲法保障。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就串謀勾結外國勢力罪，辯方指黎在2020年7月起的網上對談節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」中，的確有提及制裁，但是不代表他正在呼籲外國實施制裁；黎與嘉賓僅評論國際事務，就如一般市民在茶餐廳裡評論時政，說香港政府有何不足、應該怎樣做等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方國安法前協議均為合法-國安法後便沒有達成新協議&quot;&gt;辯方：國安法前協議均為合法 國安法後便沒有達成新協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「串謀」這一項控罪元素，辯方指在《國安法》生效之前，黎與其他被告協議做的事，包括「一人一信救香港」、國際登報計劃等行為，均是合法；即使在《國安法》生效之後，上述行為變得不合法，但是黎與他人再沒有新的犯罪協議，因此不存在「串謀」。惟法官質疑，控方的說法是指稱黎在《國安法》生效之後，相關協議仍然繼續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，於2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀，請求外國或者境外機構、組織、人員實施對香港特別行政區或者中華人民共和國進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，指黎智英於2020年7月1日至今年2月15日間，與 Mark Simon、陳梓華、李宇軒、劉祖廸及其他人串謀，請求外國或境外機構、組織、人員，實施對中國或香港進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司於2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及/或複製煽動刊物，具意圖：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a) 引起憎恨或藐視中央或香港特別行政區政府或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b) 激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變其他在香港的依法制定的事項&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;c) 引起對香港司法的憎恨、藐視或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;d) 引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;e) 煽惑他人使用暴力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;f) 慫使他人不守法或不服從合法命令。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Given these contradictions, what are the ties that bind these two figures?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cement of the relationship between Venezuela and Iran is perhaps best described by the adage “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” Their shared priority is to ensure their respective regimes’ survival in the face of perceived threats, with the United States as the primary foe. Ayatollah Khomeini, the first leader of the Islamic republic, dubbed the United States the “Great Satan,” while Chávez referred to former U.S. president George W. Bush as “the devil.” This rhetoric and outlook matches that of Russia and other active rejecters of the U.S.-led international order; indeed, Russian president Vladimir Putin has spoken out against the “collective West” in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Western observers have focused their attention on joint connivances of Russia and Iran in Eastern Europe, Eurasia, and the Middle East, where Russo-Iranian military-security operations directly affect U.S. and European interests, the Western Hemisphere is not isolated from the two countries’ quests for global influence. In fact, in many ways it is an essential piece of the puzzle. First, both Iran and Russia perceive Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) as a fertile ground for exploiting popular resentment vis-à-vis the United States and the “collective West,” which they — rather successfully — harness to advance their view of a multipolar world. Second, LAC partners could prove instrumental in offsetting the impacts of Western sanctions against Moscow and Tehran by mitigating their diplomatic and economic isolation. Finally, certain LAC countries could also serve as less scrutinized partners for further developing Russo-Iranian warfare capabilities or cooperation, sheltering mercenaries or militias — such as Hezbollah — and acting as vectors for “horizontal escalation” of conflicts in which Russia and Iran are currently involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While Western observers have focused their attention on joint connivances of Russia and Iran in Eastern Europe, Eurasia, and the Middle East, where Russo-Iranian military-security operations directly affect U.S. and European interests, the Western Hemisphere is not isolated from the two countries’ quests for global influence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines Russia’s and Iran’s creeping influence over the Western Hemisphere, assessing the historic legacy as well as the current diplomatic, economic, informational, and military-security links that contribute to the region’s continued willingness to engage with these two countries. It then offers analysis and recommendations to Western policymakers, outlining new approaches the transatlantic community should adopt to contain potential Russo-Iranian coordination in LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anti-western-sentiments-as-historical-entry-points-for-russia-and-iran-in-lac&quot;&gt;Anti-Western Sentiments as Historical Entry Points for Russia and Iran in LAC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has a long history of engagement with LAC countries, dating back to the nineteenth century, when the Russian Empire opened embassies in Brazil and Mexico in 1828 and 1890, respectively. Moscow’s presence on the continent only grew under the Soviet Union, and especially during the Cold War era. The Soviet leadership focused on countries where it could capitalize on existing anti-U.S. sentiment and interstate and intrastate rivalries. For instance, the Kremlin provided extensive military-security and economic assistance to Argentina, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Peru to support revolutionary movements. By doing so, the Soviet Union aimed to undermine U.S. standing and strengthen its footprint on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the newly established Russian Federation was unable to provide financial or security aid to LAC countries and was forced to disengage. Furthermore, in the 1990s, as Russia sought rapprochement with the United States under President Boris Yeltsin, the strategic significance of LAC in the eyes of Moscow diminished. While Yeltsin visited the United States four times during his eight years of presidency, he did not make any trips to LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An attempt to establish and maintain amicable relations with the United States did not mean, however, that the Russian political elite had fully disregarded the geopolitical importance of LAC countries. The Primakov doctrine — named for Yevgeny Primakov, a foreign minister and prime minister under Yeltsin — famously posited that, as the West was meddling and exerting influence in Russia’s “backyard” through NATO expansion and the imposition of the U.S.-dominated world order, Russia’s presence in its opponent’s “near abroad” was crucial to level the playing field. Consequently, as U.S.-Russian bilateral relations became more tense starting in the mid-2000s, Moscow began resuscitating diplomatic, economic, and security ties with its former Cold War allies Cuba and Nicaragua and built new relationships with other regional powers antagonistic toward the United States, such as Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to Russia, albeit comparatively limited in scale, Iran’s entry into LAC was preceded by revolutionary regime change and the anti-U.S. sentiments it unleashed. In 1979, the Sandinista National Liberation Front, a leftist insurgency spearheaded by Daniel Ortega, deposed the dictator Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua. That same year, the shah fled Iran, ushering in the modern Iranian theocratic state with Ayatollah Khomeini at its head. While the two movements had starkly different ideological origins, they shared a common opposition to the United States, rooted in Washington’s support for the regimes they had ousted. By the early 1980s, Nicaraguan and Iranian leaders were discussing cooperation and efforts to balance vis-à-vis both the United States and the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the close of the Cold War, Iran found its appeals to anti-U.S. sentiment losing saliency in the hemisphere as many of the militant leftist groups in the region laid down their arms or negotiated peace. In their place, Iranian proxy Hezbollah established a beachhead in the region. Its affiliate, Islamic Jihad, claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing of the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires in 1992, while Hezbollah allegedly masterminded the devastating 1994 bombing of the Argentinian Israelite Mutual Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it was not until the mid-2000s and the height of LAC’s “pink tide,” which carried a series of socialist and otherwise U.S.-skeptical governments into power, that Iran’s engagement with the hemisphere took on a more robust, institutional character. The Chávez government in Venezuela was especially important in opening the door for Iran. In addition to their shared derision of the United States as a geopolitical demon, Chávez and former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad actively worked to cultivate like-minded LAC governments. Venezuela’s oil wealth and diplomatic clout gave it a powerful platform to advocate for an expanded role for Iran in the hemisphere, and between 2005 and 2009, Iran opened embassies in six new countries in the region: Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Uruguay. This policy has continued for the most part, especially as the Trump administration’s pursuit of a maximum-pressure sanctions campaign against both Venezuela and Iran caused these two governments to double down on their bilateral ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, as Russia and Iran continue to face mounting political and economic pressure from the United States and its Western allies, expanded ties to countries in LAC, rooted in history, can serve as an important release valve for both Moscow and Tehran. Strengthened relations, not only with staunch anti-U.S. governments like those in Cuba and Venezuela but also with regional powers such as Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, could help Russia and Iran mitigate the impact of sanctions and offer them much-needed legitimacy on the world stage. Regular visits by high-ranking Russian and Iranian officials to the region have proven a comparatively low-cost means of challenging Washington’s preeminence in LAC. While these visits often tend to focus on the hemisphere’s three consolidated dictatorships — Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela — Russia and Iran continue to seek political, economic, and military-security relations with a broad array of LAC countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;converging-patterns-of-russian-and-iranian-engagement-in-lac&quot;&gt;Converging Patterns of Russian and Iranian Engagement in LAC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growing consensus among policymakers in the United States acknowledges the Western Hemisphere as a new frontier in geopolitical competition, especially following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which has emboldened authoritarian regimes to more directly challenge the U.S.-led international order. However, most analyses of great power competition in the region have focused their attention on China as the U.S. rival with both the desire and resources at its disposal to challenge Washington in its neighborhood. By contrast, neither Russia nor Iran (commonly considered “junior partners” to China in the region) possess the economic heft to comprehensively engage all countries in LAC. Instead, both have relied on asymmetrical strategies to undermine U.S. objectives and support a small set of regional allies who serve as springboards for further influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet a lack of economic clout may in fact make Russia and Iran more threatening actors in the short term. Unencumbered by China’s need to manage perceptions and diplomatic relations across more than two dozen countries, Russia and Iran can double down on disruptive and destabilizing practices. More troubling still, there is mounting evidence that, in some sectors at least, Russia and Iran may not merely be pursuing parallel strategies but could be moving toward a more coordinated approach to engagement with the hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;diplomatic-relations&quot;&gt;Diplomatic Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s post-invasion diplomatic approach to Latin America has been guided by its updated foreign policy concept, which posits an imminent decline of Western hegemony and the emergence of a multipolar world order. For instance, during his tour of the region in April 2023, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov emphasized Russia’s respect for the sovereignty of Latin American nations, referring to the region as one of the emergent centers of the multipolar world despite U.S. “bullying and imperialism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cnXstoy.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro meet at the Miraflores Presidential Palace in Caracas in April 2023. Lavrov called for like-minded countries to “join forces” against Western sanctions “blackmail” as the longtime diplomat continued his tour of Latin America.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a majority of the region has voted in favor of UN resolutions decrying Russia’s war on Ukraine, Moscow has managed to secure sympathy and tacit support from regional powers. For instance, Brazil, under the presidency of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Lula), has repeatedly championed peace proposals for the Ukraine war, most recently with the release of a set of “common understandings” between Brazil and China on the contours of a possible settlement. However, Lula has faced criticism for his perceived bias toward Russia in these negotiations. Indeed, following a 2023 tour in which he claimed that both Kyiv and Moscow shared the blame for the conflict, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby accused the Brazilian president of “parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lula is joined in the bid to forge peace in Ukraine by outgoing Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador (colloquially known as AMLO), who put forth his own peace plan in the summer of 2022. AMLO, who has previously rejected U.S. intelligence claims that Mexico City is the world’s biggest Russian espionage hub, proposed a plan calling for an immediate ceasefire and the launch of a dialogue to address the war’s underlying causes. Ukrainian diplomats rejected this option as a de facto freezing of the front lines that would allow Russia to maintain its military presence in occupied territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tellingly, neither Brazil nor Mexico signed on to the final communiqué issued at the June 2024 summit on peace in Ukraine. Regional dissonance over the correct path to a negotiated settlement in Ukraine helps muddy the waters on peace and indirectly allows Russia to undermine efforts to build a truly broad-based international coalition dedicated to a just settlement to the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Iran’s diplomatic approach toward Latin America is built on its claims to be “a nation unjustly harassed by the West,” which help it gain sympathy and secure political and economic support from the states that are either antagonistic or ambivalent at best toward the United States. For instance, in June 2023, when now-deceased Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi visited Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela for the first time since taking office, he highlighted the need for the revolutionary movements in both Iran and LAC to reassert their independence and sovereignty. “The Americans have always considered you, Latin America, as their backyard. But thank God, now you have sovereignty,” the Iranian president remarked. Raisi left the region having secured dozens of agreements with his LAC counterparts in the energy, agriculture, healthcare, education, information technology, and maritime transportation sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, Iran has maintained close diplomatic relations with Bolivia. The two nations have signed defense and security agreements that might have included the delivery of Bolivian passports to Iranian citizens. As Argentina’s minister of security, Patricia Bullrich, pointed out, such an agreement, if confirmed, would open a door to Iranian citizens with Bolivian passports across the hemisphere — a strategy that Tehran has already used in Venezuela to infiltrate the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza has also severely damaged its relations with LAC, presenting another opportunity for Iran to make inroads in the region. Keystone countries including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico have condemned the Israeli government’s prosecution of the war. The broad support among LAC governments for the Palestinian cause is primarily driven by domestic political dynamics, not foreign influence. However, as the rift between Israel and the region grows, Tehran could seize on these new openings to advance its diplomatic rhetoric as the self-proclaimed leader of the “axis of resistance.” The recent election of a more reform-minded candidate, Masoud Pezeshkian, as the country’s new president is also unlikely to significantly change Tehran’s engagement with LAC as, in his own words, “[t]here is significantly more potential for cooperation between Iran and the countries of Latin America than what is currently being realized.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javier Milei’s Argentina is nevertheless a major outlier, being one of the most outspoken supporters of Israel and of Benyamin Netanyahu in particular, the first leader whom the Argentinian president visited after his election. Argentina was the sole LAC country to vote against the UN General Assembly’s motion to recognize Palestine as a full member of the body, and it has designated Hamas as a terrorist organization. This political dissonance with the rest of the continent is a source of tension, with Argentina’s security minister Patricia Bullrich accusing Bolivia and Chile of being hotbeds for Islamist groups and ordering reinforcements to the borders with these two countries, prompting them to pull their ambassadors from Buenos Aires. It also created a major spat between Argentina and Iran, with the latter’s integration into the BRICS in January 2024 having been a key factor in Milei’s decision to walk back his predecessor’s decision to join BRICS+. Following Buenos Aires’ designation of Hamas as a terrorist group, Tehran issued a stark warning that it “will make [Argentina] regret its enmity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Russia’s and Iran’s diplomatic engagement with LAC, especially following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has in large part been based on presenting the West as an oppressor, which LAC countries could counter by exercising their right to sovereignty and supporting the establishment of a new, multipolar world order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;influence-operations&quot;&gt;Influence Operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The media environment in LAC presents the lowest barriers to entry and consequentially has been a sector where both Iran and Russia have made significant strides separately and, at times, in coordination. The Kremlin has been relying on the Spanish-language affiliates of state-backed outlets, such as RT Spanish (television and online) and Sputnik Mundo (radio and online), to spread Russian propaganda and disinformation on the continent for more than a decade. With Mexico often serving as a hub for Russian disinformation operations, these outlets overwhelmingly focus on the United States, questioning its domestic and foreign policies. According to U.S. intelligence reporting, following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has used media contacts in 13 countries across the continent, including Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, and Venezuela, to weaken international support for Ukraine. RT, Sputnik, and their regional affiliates have disseminated conspiracy theories about “denazifying Ukraine,” alleged Ukrainian aggression against Russia, NATO expansionism, and “staged recording” of civilian deaths in Ukraine. They have also depicted ongoing sanctions against Russia as beneficial for the West but harmful for the global economy and food security. In December 2023, RT Spanish even won four prestigious awards from the Mexican Press Club for its coverage of the war in Ukraine, illustrating a stark disconnect in regional perceptions of Russian news sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The media environment in LAC presents the lowest barriers to entry and consequentially has been a sector where both Iran and Russia have made significant strides separately and, at times, in coordination.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian influence operations are not only concerned with shaping attitudes toward foreign policy. In Colombia and Mexico, Russia has reportedly sought to sway the results of key elections in favor of Moscow’s preferred candidates, through its official media platforms as well as through networks of trolls, bots, and regional pro-Kremlin affiliates. In Mexico, RT Spanish broadcast a long-running video series entitled “The Battle for Mexico,” which cast then-candidate López Obrador in a favorable light as the only leader willing to confront the United States and preserve Mexican sovereignty. In Colombia, Russia-linked bots on Twitter (now known as X) were found to have promoted Gustavo Petro’s candidacy in 2022. The extent to which such efforts swayed the final result should be treated with a degree of caution, as both Petro and López Obrador won due to a confluence of factors. Nevertheless, election interference efforts remain among Moscow’s most corrosive tools to undermine democracy and sovereignty worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran’s Spanish-language media agency HispanTV has made similar strides in the region. In doing so, it has benefitted from partnerships with fellow authoritarian-leaning media outlets, which help amplify and advance its messages. National security analysts Douglas Farah and Alexa Tavarez have demonstrated, for instance, how Venezuelan outlet teleSUR, RT, and HispanTV often cite and recite one another’s work and rely on similar sets of pro-authoritarian journalists based in the region to convey their messages. These so-called “super spreaders” advance common messages critiquing U.S. policy toward the region as imperialist and uplifting the approaches of Iran, Russia, and China as seeking to challenge malign U.S. hegemony while encouraging economic development among LAC countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The convergence between Russian and Iranian influence operations could be observed less than a month before the onset of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. On January 28, 2022, an article by Pablo Jofré Leal appeared in HispanTV calling for an “alliance against [U.S.] hegemony” to be spearheaded by Russia, China, and Iran. Leal, a Chilean journalist and frequent contributor to HispanTV, RT Spanish, teleSUR, and many affiliated websites, has acted as a key node for translating messages from Moscow and Tehran for a regional audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the traditional media space, organizations like Nova Resistência, a neofascist organization and part of the broader New Resistance organization inspired by the ideas of Kremlin-backed philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, have worked not only to advance pro-Russian messages but also to praise the actions of Iran and Hezbollah. A 2023 U.S. Department of State report found that the Brazilian Nova Resistência chapter was “particularly active” in convening events, writing articles, and disseminating physical pamphlets and posters advancing pro-Kremlin narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even absent formal coordination between Iran and Russia in the information space, their methods and objectives for fomenting anti-U.S. sentiment enjoy strong complementarity. As the cases of Pablo Jofré Leal and Nova Resistência also demonstrate, the audience for such messaging within LAC enjoys a high degree of overlap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy-and-economics&quot;&gt;Energy and Economics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s economic clout in LAC is marginal, especially when compared to that of the United States and the European Union, which remain the key investors in the hemisphere, comprising 38 percent and 17 percent of Latin America’s foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in 2022, respectively. The major recipients of Russian FDI in the region include Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, and these investments tend to focus on the extractive sectors, including minerals, oil, and gas. Bilateral trade between Russia and LAC countries stands at around $12 billion, with Russia mainly exporting fertilizers, mineral fuels, iron, and steel to the region (primarily to Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Russia’s small economic footprint in LAC, the Kremlin has expressed strengthened interest in the region’s energy sector in recent years and, in certain cases, has even managed to challenge the Western companies operating on the ground. Brazil presents a noteworthy example in this regard, replacing Turkey as the largest purchaser of Russian diesel in October 2023. Overall in 2023, Brazil imported 6.1 million tons of diesel with a value of $4.5 billion from Russia — a 6,000 percent increase from the 101,000 tons of Russian diesel worth $95 million that it imported in 2022. Such a sharp rise in Russian diesel market share in Brazil, from virtually zero in 2022 to 50 percent in 2023 and 70 percent in 2024, has in large part resulted from its competitive pricing — one of the effects of the ongoing war in Ukraine. Highly reliant on cheap diesel to keep its economy moving, Brazil’s decision to pivot away from the United States in favor of Russia can further increase Moscow’s diplomatic and economic ties with Brasília, securing support from the largest country in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides Brazil, Cuba and Venezuela also represent interesting case studies for Russia’s renewed focus on making inroads into the Western Hemisphere’s energy sector. In March 2023, Igor Sechin, the head of Russia’s state oil company Rosneft, visited Havana and Caracas to discuss energy cooperation with the two countries. A year later, 90,000 metric tons of Russian oil arrived in Cuba to offer some relief to an island mired in power outages and gasoline shortages. Sanctioned by the United States, Cuba’s communist government has once again found itself beholden to the Kremlin, bringing additional revenue and economic and political opportunities to Russia. In the case of Venezuela, while Rosneft was pressured to cease its operations in Venezuela in 2020, Sechin’s visit amid the war in Ukraine and international sanctions imposed against Russia might imply and lead to renewed energy cooperation between the two countries. (In the past, Moscow relied on Rosneft to both expand the company’s portfolio and advance the country’s geopolitical interests vis-à-vis Caracas.) These intentions were reiterated during Lavrov’s visit to Venezuela in February 2024, with the Russian foreign minister promising to boost joint oil and gas production and foster “peaceful use of nuclear energy” in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some instances, however, Moscow’s efforts have gone nowhere. In Argentina, Novatek — Russia’s largest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG) — reportedly offered the Argentinian government the technology to build an LNG plant, but talks between the two parties broke off without a deal. In Bolivia, Gazprom — a Russian state-owned oil and gas company that has been present in the country for more than a decade — has failed to drill and develop any natural gas or oil fields during this period, prompting criticism from local experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has nevertheless made some advances in the clean energy and mining space, with state-owned firm Rosatom signing a $450 million deal in 2023 as part of a bid with China to develop Bolivia’s lithium reserves, estimated as the largest in the hemisphere. Overall, while Latin America’s energy sector is promising for Russia — especially following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has forced Russian companies to look elsewhere for energy deals and investments — it is still rife with risks, limitations, and competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Russia, Iran’s economic influence in the hemisphere has been limited and primarily focused on energy cooperation. In Venezuela, Iran’s presence has had an outsized impact on the ability of the government of Chávez’s successor, Nicolás Maduro, to remain in power. Iran’s expertise navigating mass international pressure was invaluable for the Maduro regime to retain oil revenues in the face of U.S. sectoral sanctions on the energy sector after the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis. Venezuela shipped crude oil to Iran, Russia, and China in return for financial assistance and cheap gasoline to maintain fuel subsidies in a time of economic turmoil. Venezuela has also relied upon Iranian technical assistance, inking a deal with Tehran in 2022 to help repair Venezuela’s El Palito refinery to the tune of some €110 million (up to $120 million). Iranian technical support has been essential as Venezuela struggles to bring its hollowed-out oil sector back to life in anticipation of the lifting of sanctions. Tehran also significantly benefits from this arrangement, having leveraged its partnership with the Maduro regime to build and sell Iranian cars and reportedly acquire over a million hectares of farmland in Venezuela to support Iran’s agricultural sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cases discussed above show that the energy sector could be another area ripe for cooperation between Iran, Russia, and their allies in the Western Hemisphere, especially Venezuela. While all three countries are ostensibly competitors in the global oil market, the layers of sanctions they face have engendered a peculiar form of covert camaraderie. Russian joint oil ventures with Venezuela produced an estimated 120,000 barrels per day in 2022, or more than one-sixth of the country’s total oil production. Venezuela, in turn, has relied heavily on Iranian tankers to launder its oil and deliver it to buyers — most often to China. Each country has therefore seemingly intuited that they have more to gain from attempting to subvert U.S.-led sanctions together than by forging their own path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This arrangement appears to have frayed in the months following the October 2023 Barbados Accords, when the United States began issuing licenses to companies to resume oil production in Venezuela. Now able to trade oil with U.S. firms for cash in hand rather than fuel, Venezuela’s trade with Iran plummeted from 2022 to 2023, leading to a diplomatic scramble by the two countries to restore their alliance. However, with the reimposition of U.S. oil sanctions on Venezuela in April 2024, energy cooperation between Venezuela, Iran, and Russia may be set to increase once more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-security-cooperation&quot;&gt;Military-Security Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s engagement with LAC countries has been guided by the aforementioned Primakov doctrine — the idea that Russia should engage with the “near abroad” of the United States in response to Washington’s meddling in internal affairs of the countries Moscow views as its “near abroad.” This is particularly true against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine. For instance, in June 2022, Nicaraguan president Ortega authorized the entry of Russian troops, military ships, and aircraft into Nicaragua to assist with military training, law enforcement, and humanitarian aid. Russian state media has linked the Russian military deployment in the country to U.S. engagement with Ukraine, with one television host stating, “If American missile systems can nearly reach Moscow from Ukrainian territory, it is time for Russia to roll out something powerful closer to the American city upon a hill.” According to some estimates, up to 3,700 Russian troops have participated in different military trainings and exchanges with the Nicaraguan army between 2014 and 2024. Russia has also operated a Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) satellite ground station in Nicaragua since 2017 (Moscow also operates four other ground stations further south in Brazil). Located just outside of the capital, Managua, the facility has raised concerns that it could be used to intercept satellite communications close to the equator, where many of the U.S. critical assets are located in geostationary orbits. Finally, Moscow has helped train the Nicaraguan National Police, implicated in serious human rights abuses, from its U.S.-sanctioned counternarcotics center, also in Managua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In June 2022, Nicaraguan president Ortega authorized the entry of Russian troops, military ships, and aircraft into Nicaragua to assist with military training, law enforcement, and humanitarian aid. Russian state media has linked the Russian military deployment in the country to U.S. engagement with Ukraine.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another especially symbolic display, a contingent of Russian soldiers took part in Mexico’s Independence Day parade in 2023. Meanwhile, Russian military exercises in the Caribbean, which included port calls in Cuba and Venezuela, have been framed by some analysts as a direct response to the Biden administration’s decision allowing Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with U.S. weapons systems. While the detachment posed little practical threat to U.S. national security, similar deployments may become more frequent as Russia looks to convey power and prestige on the world stage and continue to apply pressure to the United States within its neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/k3fpDtQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A woman and a girl wave as frigate Admiral Gorshkov, part of the Russian naval detachment visiting Cuba, leaves Havana Harbor. The detachment visited Cuba in June 2024 amid major tensions over the war in Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to military deployments and joint training exercises with its partner countries, Russia has been supplying Latin America with arms. From 2000 to 2023, Russia was the number three supplier of weapons in the hemisphere, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), behind only the United States and United Kingdom in sales. However, since 2019, according to SIPRI data, Russia has not made any major sales in the region, and with the Russian defense industrial base geared primarily toward its own war effort, it seems unlikely that Moscow will be able to reenter the market in a meaningful way anytime soon. Still, Russian arms provide continued influence over Latin American states. Countries such as Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru, which operate stocks of Russian-supplied weapons, still rely on Moscow for maintenance and upkeep. Colombia, for instance, is struggling to maintain its fleet of Soviet-designed Mi-17 military helicopters, which the local authorities have said is the direct result of the war in Ukraine. The region has also rebuked efforts by U.S. and European leaders to sell their legacy Russian and Soviet arms to Ukraine, even with assurances of replacements. Ecuador came closest in February 2024, offering to sell $200 million worth of outmoded Russian and Soviet equipment to the United States (which could presumably pass this along to Ukraine), only to backpedal in the face of Russian economic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While joint trainings, dual-use facilities, and the deployment of military assets have all featured prominently in Russia’s playbook in the region, these tactics have also increasingly become part of Iran’s tool kit for engagement in the Western Hemisphere. For instance, the drop in Russian arms sales has been accompanied by a spike in Iranian weapons to the hemisphere. This has been driven by one country, Venezuela, which in 2023 acquired at least six Peykaap-III fast attack boats, along with an estimated 25 anti-ship missiles. In April 2024, reports also surfaced that Venezuela’s National Bolivarian Armed Forces were developing a loitering munition dubbed the “Zamora V-1” based on Iranian Shahed 131/136 drones. These drones have been widely used by the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine, thus enabling Tehran to combat test, improve, and promote Iranian-made weapons and technology globally. Details at the time of this writing are scarce, but Venezuela has demonstrated a capability to replicate Iranian designs, with an undisclosed number of Mohajer drones having previously been produced under license in Venezuela. Cooperation on drone production and local upgrades to Iranian drone models have helped Venezuela build technical expertise and capacity within the country’s arms industry, helping state aerospace company EANSA to become a capable manufacturer of combat drones in its own right. The Maduro regime’s growing partnership with Tehran in the defense space is especially troubling in light of Venezuela’s escalating rhetoric toward its neighbor Guyana over the disputed Essequibo territory. Cruise missile–toting fast attack craft and loitering munitions could allow the regime to menace shipping and oil platforms off the coast of Guyana, mimicking the tactics of the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in the Red Sea and imperiling Guyana’s burgeoning offshore oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond arms sales, Iran’s security cooperation with the hemisphere has been far less mature, often relying on non-state proxies. In 2022, for instance, a Venezuelan 747 cargo plane with both Venezuelan and Iranian nationals aboard was detained in Argentina over suspicions of conducting espionage and smuggling on behalf of Iran’s Quds Force, a branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps sanctioned and designated as a terrorist entity by the United States. Iran’s 2023 naval world tour, which included stops in Brazil and transit through the Panama Canal, also illustrates how the rotation of military assets through LAC provides a means of asymmetric escalation against the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;proxies-and-partners&quot;&gt;Proxies and Partners&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow and Tehran are both proficient in the use of non-state proxies to advance their interests, and the Western Hemisphere is no exception to this. The Iranian-backed militia group Hezbollah embodies this dynamic. The group’s successes at orchestrating large-scale terror attacks in the 1990s continue to shape regional perceptions today. With a decades-long presence in the region, Hezbollah continues to operate in the so-called Triple Frontier region between Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Hezbollah’s operations have shifted northward to Venezuela, where it has allegedly embedded itself in criminal networks to facilitate money laundering and illicit financial activity. Former Venezuelan vice president Tareck El Aissami reportedly served as the intermediary between the Maduro government and Hezbollah, helping launder money for the group through contacts in the Colombian company Importadora Silvania. Furthermore, during his tenure, El Aissami was said to have arranged for members of Hezbollah to train on Margarita Island with members of the colectivos, Venezuela’s pro-regime paramilitary, thus maintaining a level of distance from formal state-to-state relations. A string of other high-profile money laundering cases over the past 20 years, from Paraguay to Colombia, has led one analyst to remark that Hezbollah “has achieved what other large terrorist groups could not, entrenching itself within the complex web of TCOs [transnational criminal organizations] and substate actors in a region far removed from its founding territory and spiritual heartland.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAC’s varied reactions to the war in Gaza will likely shift these dynamics in unpredictable ways. Brazil and Colombia have both taken steps to curtail their relations with Israel over its conduct of the war, with the latter going so far as to sever relations entirely. Both countries had long-standing security cooperation with Israel, including a joint operation between the Mossad and Brazilian police in November 2023 that resulted in the arrest of two alleged Hezbollah operatives planning a series of attacks. However, strained relations with Israel may complicate future cooperation and intelligence sharing on Hezbollah activities in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia, by contrast, is a comparatively recent entrant in its use of armed proxy groups within LAC. Perhaps the most notable episode occurred in 2019 when, amid mass unrest and fears of a potential coup against Maduro, some 400 Russian mercenaries, allegedly from the Wagner Group, arrived in Caracas to provide security for the embattled president. Similar to Wagner’s activities on the African continent, the private military contractors reportedly remain active, training the Venezuelan armed forces and protecting mining operations in the country’s Orinoco region. In May 2023, leaked U.S. national security documents showed that Wagner may have attempted to reprise this role, this time leading a scouting visit to Haiti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As LAC continues to grapple with resurgent transnational criminal organizations, there may be opportunities for Russia or even Iran to provide further security assistance. China has already exploited a perceived gap in U.S. security sector support to stand up at least 11 private security firms in the region. Meanwhile, Russia has proven adept at leveraging security challenges in Africa to expand its influence and fill its coffers. Russian private military contractors like the Wagner Group and its successor, the Africa Corps, are by now infamous for their ruthless counterinsurgency deployments in the Central African Republic, Mali, and Sudan. As electorates throughout the Western Hemisphere call for forceful action to be taken in the face of worsening criminal violence, the “brutal but effective” methods employed by authoritarian proxies may take on heightened appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and Iran are selective in their engagement with countries in LAC. While they cultivate close ties with the hemisphere’s three anti-U.S. dictatorships — Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela — they simultaneously work to gain ground in more neutral or U.S.-skeptical countries, such as Brazil and Mexico. Furthermore, as this paper has argued, Moscow and Tehran do not act in isolation from one another and are in fact increasingly pursuing convergent and coordinated goals in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russia and Iran are selective in their engagement with countries in LAC. While they cultivate close ties with the hemisphere’s three anti-U.S. dictatorships — Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela — they simultaneously work to gain ground in more neutral or U.S.-skeptical countries.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should strive to do the same in its response by partnering with like-minded allies both within LAC and across the Atlantic. In doing so, Washington should seek to strengthen its relationships with friendly nations, disrupt the ability of its foes to coordinate, and devise a resource-backed counteroffer for those countries within LAC that currently prefer to sit on the fence between the United States, Iran, and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen partnerships with friends.&lt;/strong&gt; Building partner capabilities in the media and cybersecurity space are essential elements to helping counties in LAC better insulate themselves from malign influence operations. These sectors present the lowest barriers to entry and are the areas where Russia and Iran are most clearly coordinating. To counter Moscow’s and Tehran’s inroads in the media space, the United States should look to expand scholarship programs for journalists based in LAC to help cultivate a new generation of reporters. By investing in young reporters from a diversity of backgrounds, the United States can help shape a media environment that is more discerning, critical, and capable of counteracting authoritarian political narratives organically.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;LAC’s cyber defenses face a shortage of resources and strategy across the board. However, there are promising signs that like-minded countries are beginning to take concrete steps to shore up these vulnerabilities. Costa Rica may be an especially key ally: it was the only LAC country to sign on to U.S. sanctions against Russia in 2022, and it was the victim of a devastating ransomware attack by the Russia-affiliated Conti hacker collective. U.S. Southern Command has already allocated nearly $10 million to assist Costa Rica in building up its cybersecurity capabilities. Broadening these efforts to bring in additional interested parties by establishing a cybersecurity center of excellence within the hemisphere, among other measures, could help elevate the conversation and further insulate allies from malign interference.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disrupt and deter coordination among authoritarian adversaries.&lt;/strong&gt; It has become increasingly evident that dictatorial regimes across the world pursue a common “playbook” to stifle domestic opposition and resist international pressure. Countering this requires the democratic powers of the world to devise and articulate their own playbook.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Curbing illicit financial flows is one especially important effort in the Western Hemisphere, as governments like Venezuela and Nicaragua rely on their international connections to keep their hands on the reins of power. A new investigation by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control into the universe of trade ties from Russia and Iran in LAC could provide novel insights and help better calibrate sanctions efforts against these regimes as well as the hemisphere’s dictatorships.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States should also pay close attention to military-technical cooperation between autocratic regimes. Chinese, Iranian, and Russian arms have all been used as part of Venezuela’s effort to intimidate and coerce Guyana, while Venezuela’s interest in coproducing loitering munitions with Iran would provide Caracas with a worrying new capability if carried to fruition. Limiting the extent to which hemispheric adversaries can benefit from this cooperation will be crucial to managing interstate tensions and escalation dynamics in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Articulate a counteroffer for fence-sitters.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States, for its part, should continue to emphasize and draw attention to Russian war crimes and abuses in Ukraine. But messaging will not be enough on its own, and a more fulsome, resource-backed effort is sorely needed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While Russia and Iran lack the economic dynamism of China, they remain capable of applying significant pressure to regional governments unprepared for it. The case of Ecuador’s about-face on delivering arms to Ukraine following Russian sanctions on its banana industry is particularly illustrative. Russia also remains a key supplier of fertilizer to Brazil’s all-important agricultural sector. The United States, in partnership with the European Union, should look to map potential vectors for Russian and Iranian economic pressure and seek to strengthen U.S. and EU cooperation to minimize these.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States should also seek to compete more effectively in the energy and minerals sectors. Like its engagement on the African continent, Russia has used targeted overtures in nuclear power and conventional fuel sales to expand its leverage even as a web of international sanctions encircles Moscow. Bolivia and Brazil, for instance, have both cooperated with Russia on nuclear power projects in the past two years. Meeting regional demand for power and clean energy investment will be crucial to weakening this hold, and in doing so will clearly demonstrate that the United States and its allies can deliver on the economic front for their partners in LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Because the perception of the United States can sometimes be negative across the continent, Washington could also benefit from cooperating with other non-LAC like-minded partners that do not face similar levels of public wariness. Chief among them is the European Union, which is showing increasing interest in the region, as displayed during the Spanish presidency of the EU Council in the second half of 2023 (despite the irritant of stalled free-trade agreement negotiations between the European Union and Mercosur — the trade bloc consisting of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay). This could also be the case with some of the closest U.S. Indo-Pacific partners who have a history or expressed interest in closer ties with the continent, such as Australia, Japan, and South Korea. Although all these countries are trade competitors, they share similar strategic objectives, and while their focus has been on the threats and challenges posed by China, Iran, and Russia in Eurasia, they should consider LAC a full-fledged — not marginal — theater of strategic competition. They should harness their respective competitive advantages to build offers catering to LAC’s most urgent needs in terms of infrastructure, energy, security, and defense, as well as in the informational space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

It also highlights the serious challenges Washington and Taipei must address to have a ready response.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 18, 1931, a Japanese infantry regiment conducted a “false flag” attack on the Japanese-owned South Manchuria Railway, detonating an explosive near a stretch of the track and blaming the operation on Chinese troops nearby. The next day, in response to the alleged sabotage, Japanese troops attacked a Chinese military garrison. Within months, the Japanese army had conquered Manchuria and made it a puppet state. Although a commission formed by the League of Nations eventually unraveled the deception and concluded that Japan had illegally invaded China, the international community took no meaningful action, in part because the active period of crisis had settled into a new normal and political will had evaporated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 80 years later, in February 2014, soldiers wearing uniforms without insignias or other identifying information surrounded Ukrainian military bases and seized strategic points in Crimea. Although many observers immediately suspected that these “little green men” were Russian troops, Moscow claimed that they were “local self-defense units” acting on their own initiative. The Ukrainian government quickly lost control of Crimea, which was formally annexed to Russia. Meanwhile, Russian special operations forces began quasi-surreptitiously supporting separatist uprisings in Eastern Ukraine, an operation that eventually led to the full-scale Russo-Ukrainian war that is still underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the United States and its allies are focused on the threat of an even bigger war: a possible Chinese assault on Taiwan and the cataclysmic, world-changing conflict it could provoke. But in contemplating Chinese moves against Taiwan, it is worth keeping these earlier incidents in mind because they highlight an important if underappreciated fact: great powers pursuing revisionist aims often seek to disguise their actions, create a cloud of uncertainty around them, or achieve gains through a sequence of “salami slices” in order to increase the odds of a successful fait accompli that will decrease the costs they must pay for their aggression. As Washington ponders China’s next steps vis-à-vis Taiwan, it is vital to understand how Beijing might utilize subterfuge, “salami slicing” tactics, and wedge-driving strategies to isolate Taiwan and ultimately compel “reunification.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper does not take the position that China has abandoned or will abandon the possibility of a more dramatic, full-on invasion of Taiwan, should Chinese leader Xi Jinping conclude that the road to “peaceful” annexation is closed (although the two authors of this report do differ in their views on how likely this scenario is). The potential for an outright invasion is real, and the consequences of such a gambit would be dire. A Sino-American war over Taiwan would be a global catastrophe, and it is imperative for Washington and its allies to do all they can to deter such an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet China has more than one way of coercing Taiwan into political capitulation. Indeed, the more successful Washington and its friends are in deterring the “D-Day” scenario, the more Beijing may be incentivized to focus on lower-intensity, or less obvious, forms of aggression instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper puts aside the prospect of an invasion or direct blockade and instead discusses four coercive approaches that Beijing could use to change the status quo: (1) a decapitation strike meant to exploit uncertainty in Taipei’s continuity of government arrangements; (2) a quasi-disguised maritime quarantine; (3) the taking, perhaps through ambiguous means, of one of Taiwan’s outlying islands; and (4) the staging of a catalytic incident in the Taiwan Strait. Each of these approaches would feature some degree of ambiguity and deception. Each would also target key vulnerabilities in Taiwan and in the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, not the least of which include Taiwanese political will and Taiwanese confidence in the availability of U.S. support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that China will conduct any of these operations — each of which could fail and each of which would entail significant risks for Beijing. Nor is the argument here that a conflict with China over Taiwan is preordained. In the authors’ judgment, China would only dramatically increase its coercion of Taiwan — whether disguised or overt — if it believed it had a decent chance of success and it had run out of other, less violent options for shifting the status quo. Yet it is entirely possible that Beijing could arrive at this juncture sometime in the coming years. As is on display in Ukraine, dictators make decisions that often conflict with rationality. Thus, it is crucial to understand that the parameters of possible Chinese action vis-à-vis Taiwan are more expansive than is commonly understood, if only so that the United States and its allies can forge a comprehensive response. A complete deterrence strategy must keep Beijing from salami-slicing its way to victory in the Taiwan Strait, even as the United States also races to deter a deadly high-end fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A complete deterrence strategy must keep Beijing from salami-slicing its way to victory in the Taiwan Strait, even as the United States also races to deter a deadly high-end fight.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assumptions&quot;&gt;Assumptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis rests on several assumptions about Chinese preferences and behavior:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, China wants to annex Taiwan or otherwise bring about its political capitulation to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). This has been a consistent desire of Beijing’s since 1949. Although there is a lively debate about Xi’s sense of urgency in achieving this goal, there is no doubt that he — like generations of Chinese leaders before him — seeks to bring Taiwan to heel, or that China is developing the tools, from hard military power to disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks, to do so. The fact that China is actively seeking multiple ways of achieving its long-held goal of annexation or forced capitulation means that the United States, its allies, and most importantly Taiwan itself should be contemplating all potential angles of attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, Xi or any future Chinese leader would prefer to take Taiwan with minimal international blowback. That blowback could include immediate repercussions such as economic sanctions or war with the United States; it could also include longer-term costs, such as a region that rallies against Beijing after Taiwan falls. The more dramatic the action China takes against Taiwan, the stronger the regional and global reaction might be. Beijing’s grand strategy encompasses goals beyond taking Taiwan, and so it will seek to balance its global aspirations with the important objective of achieving “reunification.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, and related, Beijing would prefer to take Taiwan in ways that make it harder for the United States to intervene effectively and rally regional and global support if it does get involved. This puts a premium on pursuing annexation in ways that mask Beijing’s intentions, or at the very least sow doubt about what is happening and who is at fault. Over the past 15 years, for instance, China has often blamed the Philippines or Japan for escalating tensions in the South and East China Seas — and then used the resulting crises to strengthen its presence around key hot spots. More recently, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) launched joint military exercises in the waters and airspace around Taiwan in response to a “provocative” inauguration speech by Taiwanese president William Lai. Decisions to use military force are ultimately political choices, and the more China can move in ways that complicate the politics and geopolitics of a U.S. response, the bigger the head start it will have toward achieving a fait accompli.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, Beijing would ideally like to avoid the most vexing governance and security challenges that could occur after a direct, full-bore assault. Put differently, Beijing would prefer to rule a Taiwan that is not ruined, physically and economically, by conflict or roiled by a raging insurgency. Coercing Taipei to accept a political settlement, even an unpopular one, minimizes the governance and security challenges in comparison to a post-invasion scenario. Assuming that Beijing cannot find a (coerced) political path forward, it may still prefer to use tools other than the PLA — such as the People’s Armed Police, the Chinese Coast Guard, or the intelligence services — to precipitate a change in the status quo. Of course, the realities of pursuing an annexation strategy may complicate Beijing’s desires; nonetheless, from a planning perspective, the cleaner and less violent the path to “reunification,” the easier the security and governance challenges that follow annexation will become.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fifth, China does not necessarily have to pursue annexation in a single bite. It could try, instead, to coerce Taipei into formal political negotiations that would have unification as the eventual endpoint, on the assumption that those negotiations would be consummated after Taiwanese resolve and U.S. credibility are shattered. Again, recent experience is instructive: Beijing’s periodic assertiveness around Scarborough Reef and Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea is driven, in part, by the desire to put pressure on the U.S.-Philippines alliance by demonstrating that Washington can do little to help Manila uphold its economic rights and territorial claims in scenarios short of all-out war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these assumptions in mind, some might look to Hong Kong’s recent experience as the model for Beijing’s preferred Taiwan strategy. Yet this analogy is both instructive and misleading. It is instructive in the sense that Beijing eventually achieved a decisive outcome — a significant blow to Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” arrangement — but it did so through measures meant to minimize collateral damage to the city’s position as a global financial hub. China did not, for instance, send the PLA into the city’s streets — a step that likely would have provoked greater global blowback. Instead, it used local police forces to quell the demonstrations and then — utilizing bureaucratic and legal channels — pushed through a draconian national security law that dealt the critical strike to Hong Kong’s autonomy. Because Beijing used lawfare to achieve its aims, it was politically and diplomatically challenging for the United States, the United Kingdom, and other stakeholders to do much beyond symbolic sanctions. The Chinese leadership calculated that this combination of measures would achieve their desired result — breaking the back of independent politics — with minimal geopolitical cost. Rather than demonstrating Xi’s unbridled appetite for risk, the Hong Kong example demonstrates his preference for lawfare and salami-slicing as a means to fundamentally alter the strategic landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Hong Kong analogy also has limitations, the most important of which is that the city had been Chinese de jure territory for more than 20 years by the time the culminating actions came. This gave Beijing legal channels through which to constrict Hong Kong’s political liberties. It also meant that China could use non-military forces, such as the police, to suppress the popular response. Such options would not be available to China in a Taiwan scenario, so Beijing would need alternative ways of generating the leverage necessary to achieve a decisive outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, just because Beijing might want to take Taiwan through actions short of invasion does not mean it can do so. It is possible that increased, but not immediately decisive, coercion of Taiwan could actually encourage a stronger U.S. commitment to the island or incentivize Taiwan to take stronger measures to defend itself. It should be remembered that Mao Zedong’s shelling of Taiwan’s offshore islands in 1954 encouraged President Dwight D. Eisenhower to push through a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan. Something similar has happened in recent years, as the PLA’s provocative military exercises have led to increased U.S. arms sales and more explicit promises of U.S. support by President Biden. Indeed, options beneath the threshold of outright war all suffer from this potential liability, which is why the notion that Chinese leaders might opt for dramatic, decisive military action meant to solve the Taiwan problem once and for all cannot be dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the extreme risks and potentially disastrous costs of invasion also must weigh heavily on Beijing’s calculus, which is why options short of invasion must be considered, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-1-decapitation-strike&quot;&gt;Scenario 1: Decapitation Strike&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 19, 2004, President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu were traveling in an open-top Jeep in the southwest city of Tainan for a campaign stop when two bullets tore through their vehicle, injuring both Chen and Lu. The pair won reelection the following day, but before the authorities could complete their investigation into the assassination attempt, two of the suspected gunmen died under mysterious circumstances. Although some, including Vice President Lu, blamed the PRC for the attack, no conclusive evidence was found to support this assertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, an assailant carrying a stolen Japanese sword attacked a military police officer outside of the Presidential Office Building. According to police reports, the man, surnamed Lu, had a PRC flag in his possession at the time of the attack. More recently, a member of the Presidential Office’s Department of Security Affairs and an officer from the National Security Bureau’s Special Service Center were convicted of leaking information to Chinese intelligence about then-president Tsai Ing-wen’s itinerary. According to media reporting, the intelligence included a “hand-drawn organizational chart of the Special Service Center,” as well as “the names, titles and work phone numbers of senior security officers guarding the Presidential Office and Tsai’s residence in the heart of Taipei.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These incidents highlight two underappreciated risks to Taiwan’s political resiliency: there is insufficient security around Taiwan’s elected leadership, and perhaps more worryingly, there is insufficient legal clarity on the line of succession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Taiwan reportedly has an internal plan for leadership transition, Article 49 of its constitution merely stipulates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In case the office of the President should become vacant, the Vice President shall succeed until the expiration of the original presidential term. In case the office of both the President and the Vice President should become vacant, the President of the Executive Yuan shall act for the President; and, in accordance with the provisions of Article 30 of this Constitution, an extraordinary session of the National Assembly shall be convoked for the election of a new President and a new Vice President, who shall hold office until the completion of the term left unfinished by the preceding President.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This language raises several worrying questions: What is the timeline for the convocation of the National Assembly? Hours? Days? Months? Article 30 stipulates that the president of the Legislative Yuan (LY) “shall issue the notice of convocation,” but it does not clarify under what timeline and what occurs should the president of the LY fail to issue the notice in a timely manner. Furthermore, what happens if all three individuals listed are incapacitated or killed? How can the National Assembly be convoked?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing may consider exploiting these vulnerabilities to create a sharp constitutional crisis, and it could use the resulting chaos to alter Taiwan’s political orientation. It might do so if years of accumulating political trends in Taiwan — such as continued Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) dominance of the presidency — convince Chinese officials that inaction would be the greater risk. Alternatively, Beijing might act if it believes that a dramatic change in cross-Strait dynamics — such as a formal declaration of de jure independence or the reestablishment of the U.S.-Taiwan Mutual Defense Treaty — was highly likely to occur. In other words, an assassination attempt on Taiwan’s political leadership would be intended to serve as a substitute for a full-on invasion, carried out in a way that is designed to create confusion for the Taiwanese people and the United States. And it would not come out of the blue; it would instead follow a progression of political and diplomatic developments that Beijing considered to pose a near-existential risk to its cross-Strait strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in 2004, Beijing would be the early and obvious target of recrimination, but the key question is how or if Taiwan and the United States would be able to formulate an effective response. In the absence of clear proof, accusations would remain just that. And as was the case in Crimea in 2014, or Manchuria in 1931, even after the truth becomes apparent, the window of opportunity to take effective action might well have closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How might this scenario play out? A successful attack on Taiwan’s president and vice president, perhaps during a presidential inauguration or during the president’s annual National Day address on October 10, would immediately throw the island into turmoil. If the president of the LY were unharmed, this individual would bear enormous responsibility for bringing political order to a badly shaken nation. Such an effort would be difficult even in the most mature of democracies. In this early chaos, Beijing would have ample opportunities to stoke fear and uncertainty through disinformation and covert political meddling. If the LY president were killed, Taiwan would face an even graver crisis due to the acute leadership vacuum. Even if Taiwan had an internal line of succession, the absence of a publicly and constitutionally recognized process for transferring political power would call into question how legitimate that transfer is in the eyes of a shell-shocked public. Turning again to current events, the current fractious nature of Taiwan’s legislative politics, owing to an extraordinarily divisive partisan political environment, should put a damper on how likely the prospect of the three main political parties “coming together” is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How might Beijing take advantage of the ensuing chaos? There is the prospect of Beijing unilaterally sending “security assistance” to help stabilize the situation, but even as Taiwan’s people reel, this might be seen as too direct an effort. A more realistic path is for pro-Beijing voices in Taiwan’s political system to seek to utilize the confusion and constitutional crisis to seize political power or otherwise open up space for a dramatically transformed political leadership on Taiwan. Success would not be guaranteed, of course, and Beijing would only consider such a move if it saw the cross-Strait situation as dire and felt the need to take drastic steps to reorient the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, this type of brazen attack would be a huge gamble. Any assassination attempt may fail, exposing Beijing’s complicity in the process. Even if the attack were successful, there is no guarantee that a post-decapitation strike plan would be carried out with any precision. Moreover, if Beijing intended to send “security assistance” to Taiwan following an assassination, it would presumably have to build up its forces opposite the island beforehand, which might give the game away. And any attack on Taiwan’s leadership would likely be seen by many in Taiwan and the international community as obvious Chinese aggression, calling forth a punitive response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s bet, in other words, would have to be that this option nonetheless carries less risk than either allowing Taiwan to drift further away from the mainland or taking more overt military action to change its trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-2-quarantine&quot;&gt;Scenario 2: Quarantine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2022, Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, making her the first speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives to do so in a quarter-century. Beijing responded with military exercises meant to show off the PLA’s improving capabilities to conduct a blockade, bombardment, or invasion of Taiwan. Chinese missiles overflew Taiwan (albeit through outer space) and splashed down in its surrounding waters — a clear demonstration of Beijing’s ability to choke off vital sea lanes. In May, just after the inauguration speech of President William Lai, Beijing again launched massive military exercises encircling Taiwan, including “comprehensive law enforcement operations” by the Chinese Coast Guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent exercises highlight an option available to Beijing short of invasion and formal blockade: a quarantine meant to probe Washington’s risk tolerance and potentially strain its relationship with Taipei while sending a clear signal to the people on Taiwan that they are isolated. As a recent CSIS report on the prospect of a PRC quarantine of Taiwan concluded, “The purpose of a quarantine is not to completely seal Taiwan off from the world but to assert China’s control over Taiwan by setting the terms for traffic in and out of the island.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing might seize on any variety of potential pretexts: a “provocative” statement or policy departure from Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te; a trip to the island by another high-ranking U.S. official; or a U.S. arms sale that, from Beijing’s perspective, threatens the status quo in the strait. A quarantine would be meant to mimic the effects of a more traditional naval blockade, without necessarily emulating its forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Beijing could announce that the Chinese Coast Guard, rather than the PLA Navy, would conduct customs inspections of shipping headed to and from Taiwan. It could further disrupt maritime traffic into Taiwan by conducting missile tests that terminate in frequently used shipping lanes in the international waters off the island’s major ports. Related, the PLA could announce a series of air and sea exercises in international waters off of Taiwan’s major western ports with no indication of duration, disrupting maritime trade under the pretext of “normal” military training. China could also ratchet up the pressure by having the PLA Air Force “escort” traffic into Taiwan’s air space, as some observers feared it might do at the time of Speaker Pelosi’s visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China certainly has the capabilities for any of these scenarios. Its coast guard is the world’s largest; it features significant surface combatants and is, in essence, a second Chinese navy. Beijing also boasts the world’s largest conventional missile force, with a deep magazine of short-range missiles that can target the waters around Taiwan. Its inventory of fighter aircraft dwarfs Taiwan’s and whatever contingent the United States has available in the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What might make this option even more attractive is the dilemmas it would create for the United States, its regional allies, and Taiwan. Of the 193 UN member states, only 11 (plus the Holy See) diplomatically recognize Taiwan. So even though Washington and its allies would strenuously object to Chinese actions, a customs quarantine would be a less clear-cut act of international aggression than an invasion or even a conventional naval blockade of a fully sovereign state. By relying primarily on the Chinese Coast Guard and shore-based assets, this option would also reduce the danger of high-seas encounters between war-fighting navies (at the outset, at least). Similarly, this approach offers China the ability to achieve some effects of a blockade without crossing into what Taiwan deems as its territorial waters; missiles splashing down just outside of that limit could scare off shipping or at least drive insurance rates skyward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The soft quarantine would thus highlight, in a very public way, Taiwan’s inherent vulnerability as an island nation dependent on imports of food, energy, and other vital resources.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soft quarantine would thus highlight, in a very public way, Taiwan’s inherent vulnerability as an island nation dependent on imports of food, energy, and other vital resources. Even if a quarantine were only enforced selectively or intermittently, it would remind Taiwan of the economic noose Beijing can cinch tight around its neck. The United States and other friendly countries might try to defeat the quarantine by organizing a relief expedition and escorting planes and ships into Taiwan. But Washington might struggle to do so indefinitely, especially if this crisis happened when U.S. naval assets were already stretched thin by other commitments — for example, threats to freedom of navigation in the narrow waterways around the Arabian Peninsula. Indeed, the true goal of this strategy might be to expose the limits of U.S. support of Taiwan — and thereby soften the island up for further pressures meant, eventually, to cause its capitulation. There is also the possibility that the voices calling for “restraint” in the United States and other Western capitals would win out, after debate on whether Washington really wants to risk a conflict with China over some ships being boarded in waters thousands of miles away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not to say this approach is risk-free for Beijing. A limited quarantine would still be seen as aggression by Washington, Tokyo, Canberra, Manilla, and Seoul, to say nothing of Taipei, and so while it may “succeed” in the short term, it might also strengthen international support for Taipei, just as Beijing’s firing of rockets into Japan’s exclusive economic zone in August 2022 helped galvanize a more assertive Japanese approach vis-à-vis China. This approach could still turn into a high-stakes game of chicken, if U.S. warships and aircraft escort relief shipments into Taiwan and dare Beijing to get in the way. If China does not blink, in that scenario, it could have a war on its hands; if it falters, that could undermine the credibility of its coercive threats. Moreover, blockades and quarantines have a poor record of convincing countries to give up their independence; just as often, the suffering they cause strengthens, at least for a time, the will to resist. But a quarantine might still appeal to Xi, not least because it would also force the United States to decide if it wants to escalate to a full-blown crisis — and to sustain Taiwan indefinitely — in a situation where the PLA has not yet fired a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-3-offshore-island-seizure&quot;&gt;Scenario 3: Offshore Island Seizure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several of Taiwan’s outer islands already live in the shadow of U.S. ambiguity, as the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act — which directs the president and congress to consider “appropriate action” in response to “threats to the security or the social or economic system of the people of Taiwan” — covers only “the islands of Taiwan and the Pescadores [‘Penghu’].” This means that one of the only legally binding commitments the United States has to Taiwan does not extend to its outlying islands — Pratas, Kinmen, Itu Aba, the Wuchiu Islands, and Matsu. As a result, these islands are potential targets for a Chinese takeover, not necessarily as a stepping stone for a full invasion of Taiwan, but as a way of probing U.S. and Taiwanese risk appetite and exposing the limits of American commitment and credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This calculus has been demonstrated to exist in modern U.S.-China relations. During the two Taiwan Strait crises of the 1950s (1954 and 1958), Mao Zedong repeatedly used the shelling of Taiwan’s offshore islands as a way to probe the United States and test its relationship with Taipei. As Mao stated in August 1958 meeting of the Politburo, “although we have fired dozens of thousands or rounds on Jinmen [Kinmen], we only mean to probe [America’s intention].” He added, “we need to see if the Americans want to carry these islands on their back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An appealing target might be Pratas Island, which is sparsely populated with only a small contingent of Taiwanese coast guard and military personnel. The island is of little inherent strategic value to Taiwan, and its seizure might not provoke any substantial military response from either Taiwan or the United States, assuming casualties are low to zero. At a minimum, the takeover of the island would force the United States to confront the dilemma of whether it wants to risk major war with China over a small island of just 430 total acres that sits in the middle of the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Beijing has multiple options for taking Pratas Island. It could announce military exercises in the waters and airspace surrounding the island that would have the functional effect of cutting Pratas off from its regular shipments of water, food, and other supplies from Taiwan’s main island. Beijing might then signal through lower-tier diplomatic channels that Taiwan can rotate existing military and coast guard off the island, but it cannot bring new troops and coast guard on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, a more confrontational — and riskier — approach would be simply to directly overpower the tiny contingent of coast guard and marines stationed on the island. This would, of course, invite condemnation from Taipei, Washington, Tokyo, Manila, and other capitals that would see such a move as naked aggression. But it is not at all clear that any of these countries, including the United States, would be able and willing to muster a proportionate punitive response. For the United States, the challenge would be explaining to the American people why a tiny island nearly 300 miles from Taiwan, and which is not covered by the Taiwan Relations Act, is worth a possible conflict with China, the world’s second-largest economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any of these scenarios, geography would severely constrain the response from Taipei and Washington, who would have to decide whether to tolerate the loss of a small, geopolitically insignificant chunk of Taiwan’s territory or risk a much bigger fight just a few miles from China’s shores. As Lancaster University’s Andrew Chubb has written, an outer island seizure “would offer Beijing greater flexibility and escalation control, lower risk of civilian casualties, and less likelihood of sparking a strong Taiwanese response or U.S. intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common objection to such scenarios holds that the capture of an outer island yields China little to no strategic benefit if the goal is the full annexation of Taiwan, as it would still need to attempt a direct attack on the main island of Taiwan, which would presumably be on high alert. Further, even if the PLA were to cleanly seize Pratas, it would simply confirm the fears of many countries in the region — its initial gain of Taiwan territory would have come at the expense of “tripping the alarm” and therefore galvanizing action in Tokyo, Manilla, and Canberra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But such objections are premised on the idea that Beijing’s immediate goal in undertaking such actions would be “reunification.” A more plausible objective for Beijing would be to cut a slice of salami that the United States and Taiwan will not be willing or able to defend. Here, the main goal would be a clear provocation that is met with an underwhelming response, for it would publicly demonstrate that Washington’s bark is worse than its bite when it comes to defending Taiwan. This strategy could thereby erode Taiwan’s confidence in U.S. support — to say nothing of its confidence in its ability to protect itself — while also provoking anxiety in U.S. allies and partners over Washington’s inability to credibly defend against incremental Chinese aggression. And at the point that Beijing is willing to undertake such a gambit, it may already be pricing in the erosion of its remaining goodwill in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-4-false-flag&quot;&gt;Scenario 4: False Flag&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final scenario involves a false flag operation — akin to what Japan perpetrated in Manchuria in 1931 — meant to justify subsequent military action against Taiwan. The current situation offers plenty of possibilities. Chinese aircraft regularly fly across the center line of the strait or into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, where they are tracked by Taiwanese air defenses or intercepted by Taiwanese fighters. Run-ins between Taiwan’s coast guard and Chinese civilian vessels have occasionally turned deadly. Chinese drones overfly Taiwanese territory; Chinese forces intercept — and dangerously crowd — planes and ships belonging to Taiwan’s friends. The air and waters of the Western Pacific are becoming crowded, dangerous, and primed for some catalytic incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China could concoct a Taiwanese “provocation” — a collision between Taiwanese and Chinese ships or aircraft, or perhaps even an alleged Taiwanese attack on Chinese forces operating in or around the strait. It could then use full-throated propaganda and disinformation to pin the blame on Taipei and exploit the incident to obliterate the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One option would be to use the incident as justification for a large-scale, potentially decisive attack on Taiwan, in which case the point of the subterfuge would be simply to complicate the domestic and coalition politics of the U.S. response. Or Beijing could use the incident as pretext for something more limited, such as “retaliatory” strikes on Taiwanese bases and military assets. Likewise, the PLA Air Force could simply conduct large-scale, persistent intrusions into Taiwan’s airspace, meant to assert its ability to overfly the island at will — forcing Taipei to choose between submitting to this confidence-crushing humiliation or contesting these intrusions at the risk of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach offers many benefits for Beijing. It would showcase China’s overwhelming escalation dominance in the area around Taiwan, which leaves Taipei with few good options for responding to limited strikes or stepped-up military pressure. It would exploit the ability of China’s state-directed propaganda apparatus to rapidly disseminate a false or misleading narrative, as officials and media outlets in the United States, Taiwan, and other nations would struggle to respond. It could also strain the U.S.-Taiwan relationship by forcing Washington to decide how much risk to run in pushing back against limited Chinese aggression — a real dilemma, given that U.S. officials would presumably not wish to see matters escalate further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if a false flag incident led to more dramatic forms of aggression, this approach could — by sowing ambiguity and confusion — slow U.S. decisionmaking and exacerbate the severe time pressures a distant United States faces, even in the most favorable circumstances, in rushing to Taiwan’s aid. A false flag operation does not have to fool everyone forever. It just has to foul up the international response long enough for Beijing to create new facts on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downsides are also considerable. The United States has shown, during the war in Ukraine, that it can sometimes detect and reveal false flag operations before they occur (although this may hinge on remarkable intelligence penetration of the sort Washington seems to have achieved in the Kremlin). Even if a false flag operation created momentary confusion, any further use of force against Taiwan could quickly bring clarity to the debate in Washington and other capitals. And if the false flag were merely a prelude to more limited military actions, the United States could still respond in ways that would make Taiwan a tougher nut to crack — by deploying larger numbers of troops on Taiwanese territory, for example. If this was the case, the outcome might actually be to increase Taiwan’s resilience by strengthening its faith in U.S. support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these options is a silver bullet for Beijing. Deceptions can be unraveled. Coercion, even when clouded by confusion, can invite strategic blowback. To return to an earlier example, Russia’s ambiguous aggression in Crimea gave it control of that peninsula, but at the same time, Kyiv responded to the loss of Crimea by accelerating its alignment with the transatlantic community — and thereby confronted Putin with the dilemma he tried to solve, disastrously, with a full-on invasion in 2022. Yet China might still consider limited options — both because the near-term risks associated with them remain lower than the risks associated with a large-scale, overt aggression such as a direct invasion, and because these options could create significant political dilemmas for Taiwan and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the scenarios reveals a weakness China could try to exploit: from Taiwan’s deficient continuity-of-government procedures, to its inherent economic vulnerabilities, to uncertainties around how the United States would respond in crises short of all-out conflict. Most fundamentally, these approaches would target Taiwan’s political will to resist and its confidence in U.S. support — the two vital, interrelated intangibles that Beijing must weaken to achieve unification without a brutal fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these scenarios illustrate how Beijing might try to thread that needle, they also highlight some of the challenges Washington and Taipei must address. Taiwan’s survival may hinge as much on its internal security and continuity-of-government procedures as on its stockpile of anti-ship missiles and sea mines. The United States, for its part, needs to be developing contingency plans for cases of limited aggression. The specifics of those plans will vary according to the contingency. But the crucial point is that they must include sharp, non-kinetic punishments that allow the United States to inflict damage on China without sparking a larger military confrontation in places where the escalation dynamics are unfavorable — as well as measures that defeat the intended Chinese political effect of ambiguous aggression by significantly deepening U.S. military, diplomatic, and economic support for Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States might communicate to Beijing that any significant coercive change in the status quo would render the norms and agreements governing U.S.-Taiwan-China relations a dead letter — thereby clearing the way for, among other things, a thicker, more robust military-to-military relationship between Washington and Taipei, and perhaps even a larger, more capable, and more visible U.S. troop presence in Taiwan. Or it could indicate that aggression against outlying islands is likely to lead to more explicit U.S. security guarantees for the Taiwanese territory that remains. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act already sets the groundwork for such messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the United States might — in coordination with allies and partners — preload packages of economic sanctions that could be applied in cases of ambiguous aggression. The challenge here is that the magnitude of sanctions needed, and the importance of signaling them credibly and early, are all difficult to pull together, especially under scenarios where Beijing’s actions are in the gray zone, and therefore not always seen as sufficiently provocative to risk a possible global recession. It would also be useful to wargame scenarios short of outright conflict with Taiwan and other friendly countries, if only to form a stronger shared understanding of the difficulties those scenarios might create in the capitals whose combined effort would be needed to forge an effective response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In a contest short of war, the center of gravity is Taiwan’s confidence in its relationship with Washington and in its own ability to resist.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a contest short of war, the center of gravity is Taiwan’s confidence in its relationship with Washington and in its own ability to resist. The goal should thus be to convince Beijing that violent half-measures will backfire strategically even if they succeed tactically, as they would strengthen U.S. and international support for Taiwan and thereby harden Taipei’s hostility to unification at the point of a gun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most broadly, the upshot of this analysis is that Washington needs to expand its conception of deterrence in the Taiwan Strait. If the United States prepares only for incremental or ambiguous aggression, it risks making a full-scale invasion more attractive for Beijing. But if it focuses only on high-end deterrence, it could lose on the installment plan as China uses creative tactics that erode Taiwan’s sovereignty and its confidence in the United States. Beijing has many ways to change the status quo in a sensitive area. The United States will need a holistic deterrence strategy to match.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方指黎智英對談節目就如市民在茶餐廳評論政府 從沒籲外國制裁 官押明早裁表證成立與否&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，控方早前舉證完畢，辯方今（24日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）作中段陳詞，要求法庭就黎面對的3項控罪裁定表證不成立。就串謀發布煽動刊物罪，辯方指涉案報導和評論僅為了引起公眾關注一些牽涉公眾利益的事情，這是一般報紙本來就會做的工作，而且言論和新聞自由均受憲法保障。就串謀勾結外國勢力罪，辯方指黎在網上對談節目中的確有提及制裁，但是不代表他正在呼籲外國實施制裁；黎與嘉賓僅評論國際事務，就如一般市民在茶餐廳裡評論時政，說香港政府有何不足、應該怎樣做等。法官押後至明日上午（25日）宣布裁定表證是否成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方言論及新聞自由受憲法保障-涉案文章僅引公眾關注為一般報紙工作&quot;&gt;辯方：言論及新聞自由受憲法保障 涉案文章僅引公眾關注、為一般報紙工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻指，言論自由和新聞自由均受到憲法保障。控方的案情指稱黎利用《蘋果日報》作為平台發布煽動刊物，辯方形容指控「奇怪」，因他們發布的報導和評論均為了引起公眾關注一些牽涉公眾利益的事情，這是一般報紙本來就會做的工作，而且不同報紙本來就帶有光譜上不同的政治立場，不應被視為「煽動刊物」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官杜麗冰指，法庭判斷文章是否「煽動刊物」時，不單只要看文章內容，也要視乎發布的背景。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方國安法生效後沒有新的犯罪協議-官控方指稱犯罪協議持續&quot;&gt;辯方：國安法生效後沒有新的犯罪協議 官：控方指稱犯罪協議持續&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「串謀」這一項控罪元素，彭耀鴻指「串謀」涉及多於一人協議做非法事情，或者協議用非法手段去做合法事情。彭力陳，即使在《國安法》生效之前，黎與其他《蘋果》高層之間存在犯罪協議，但是在《國安法》生效之後，便再沒有新的犯罪協議，因此不存在「串謀」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰則指，控方的案情是指稱犯罪協議在《國安法》生效之前形成，當2020年7月1日《國安法》生效之後，相關協議變得不合法，然而黎與其他被告繼續。李官又指，這個議題是一個事實判斷，而非如辯方所說是一個法律議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑黎叫撐住意味繼續犯罪協議-辯方僅籲同事繼續經營報紙&quot;&gt;官質疑黎叫「撐住」意味繼續犯罪協議 辯方：僅籲同事繼續經營報紙&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭耀鴻則重申，在《國安法》生效之前，黎與其他被告協議去做的是合法事情，當它在《國安法》生效之後變得不合法，他們便從根本上更改了整個協議。法官杜麗冰則質疑，辯方從沒有在盤問控方證人期間，向他們指出以上說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰又質疑，在沒有任何證據下，辯方基於什麼基礎而指稱被告的協議是合法，而且合法與否並非基於被告自己的意見，不是被告覺得是合法便是合法。彭耀鴻則重申，黎與其他被告之間的協議並不涉任何罪行，一向都是完全合法（perfectly lawful）。根據張劍虹和陳沛敏的證供，《國安法》生效之後，他們徵詢法律意見，以確保《蘋果》不觸犯任何法律，可見他們的協議並非觸犯法律。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官李素蘭質疑，黎還柙後仍然叫同事繼續「撐住」。彭耀鴻則指，黎的意思是叫同事繼續營運《蘋果日報》，不代表叫同事繼續犯法。李素蘭回應指，須視乎相關證據去理解黎說「撐住」的意思是什麼。彭重申，黎的意思是叫同事繼續經營及出版《蘋果》，法庭不能以此說話來推論黎籲同事觸犯法律。法官杜麗冰和李素蘭聞言均指，這是一個牽涉事實裁定的議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黎智英對談節目確有提及制裁-但不代表呼籲制裁&quot;&gt;辯方：黎智英對談節目確有提及制裁 但不代表呼籲制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭耀鴻指，黎曾經在2020年7月之前曾提倡外國制裁，但是這是在《國安法》生效之前發生，其時相關行為完全合法，然而黎在《國安法》生效之後便沒有繼續呼籲制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎在2020年7月開始製作網上對談節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」，但是他在節目中從沒呼籲外國制裁中國和香港。黎與其私人助手 Mark Simon 之間的訊息僅表達黎的個人意見，並不構成任何證據顯示有犯罪協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，即使黎在 Live Chat 節目中的確有提及制裁，但是不代表他正在呼籲外國實施制裁。惟法官杜麗冰指，假設有人說「制裁有幫助，能迫使政府為自己的行為負責」等言論，可以被視為等同於呼籲制裁，視乎說話者在怎樣的情況下說這番言論。彭耀鴻回應指，因此法庭需要將語境考慮在內，就本案而言，「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」每集時間頗長，討論內容均圍繞國際事務，與呼籲制裁大相逕庭，不足以作出推論指犯罪協議存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黎智英節目僅討論國際局勢-正如市民在茶餐廳討論時政&quot;&gt;辯方：黎智英節目僅討論國際局勢 正如市民在茶餐廳討論時政&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，黎智英與不同嘉賓在對談節目中僅就國際事務表達意見、評論拜登政府應該怎樣做等等，就如一般市民在茶餐廳裡評論時政，說香港政府有何不足、應該怎樣做、美國政府及歐洲政府應怎樣做等，然而這不足以達至推論指黎有犯罪協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就黎智英刊於專欄「成敗樂一笑」的文章，辯方指黎僅表達其個人見解，沒有任何內容可以被用來推論黎串謀呼籲制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指蘋果編採政策不變不代表黎同意犯法-官質疑打擦邊球&quot;&gt;辯方指《蘋果》編採政策不變不代表黎同意犯法 官質疑「打擦邊球」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方案情指稱，在《國安法》生效之後，《蘋果》的編採政策沒有改變過。辯方則指，縱使證人供稱到獄中探訪還柙的黎時，黎寄語《蘋果》同事不要害怕、要繼續如常營運《蘋果》，亦沒有指示要改變編採政策，但是不代表黎同意干犯法律，他的意思只是叫同事繼續出版報紙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官李素蘭則引述楊清奇的證供中「打擦邊球」說法，質疑《蘋果》冒險超越法律界線。彭耀鴻則強調《蘋果》高層想盡力維持在法律界線之內，就如打乒乓球般，雙方目標是令乒乓球留在界線內，而不是瞄準界線而來發球。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏早前供稱黎智英提議製作制裁名單-辯方稱訊息非出自黎手筆&quot;&gt;陳沛敏早前供稱黎智英提議製作制裁名單 辯方稱訊息非出自黎手筆&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏曾供稱，2020年7月14日，時任美國總統特朗普簽署《香港自治法》的行政命令之後，黎智英以 WhatsApp 傳送相關行政命令內文，以及提出準備一份「Shit List」，陳理解黎的意思是要製作「制裁名單」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3zOG2Tr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前《蘋果日報》執行總編輯 林文宗（左）、前《蘋果日報》副社長 陳沛敏（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今指稱，從 WhatsApp 訊息的字眼可見，黎當時只是將另一名美國人的訊息，連同行政命令內文和「Shit List」的提議，一併複製並傳送給陳沛敏。因為相關行政命令是很重要的新聞，而陳當時身為高層，所以黎立即傳送給陳，然而「Shit list」並非黎本人的提議。法官杜麗冰質疑辯方是在作出假設，而且相關訊息是否由黎智英撰寫、黎是否同意訊息內容，皆屬於事實爭議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方有充份證據證明國安法生效後-黎智英仍然是犯罪協議的一份子&quot;&gt;控方：有充份證據證明國安法生效後 黎智英仍然是犯罪協議的一份子&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行重申，控方一直以來都是指稱黎與其他被告在《國安法》之前達成犯罪協議，並在國安法生效之後繼續相關協議。而且案中有充份證據證明《國安法》生效之後，黎智英仍然是協議的一份子，包括其網上對談節目內容、Twitter 上有關「重光團隊」、IPAC和裴倫德的帖文等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zndiTrc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 副刑事檢控專員 周天行（左）、高級檢控官 陳穎琛（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方強調，法庭不能夠只著眼於《國安法》生效之後發生的事，而是要將黎智英在《國安法》之前所作的行為納入考慮，以全面地理解案情，因此控方從頭到尾、根據時序來顯示黎智英做過什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，所有以從犯證人身份出庭作供的《蘋果》高層均供稱，在國安法生效之後，《蘋果》的編採政策沒有改變，他們繼續做一直以來的工作。當張劍虹對於黎邀請美國退休軍官 Jack Keane 出席對談節目表達關注，質疑會否過於敏感，黎則回應：「我一定去到盡㗎，我冇得褪㗎。」就另一項串謀勾結外國勢力罪，從犯證人陳梓華供稱在2020年6月16日赴壹傳媒大樓會見黎智英，當時黎要求陳繼續國際線工作，形容《國安法》「雷聲大，雨點小」。控方指以上均顯示《國安法》之後黎決定繼續涉案行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，只要有足夠證據顯示犯罪協議持續，而且參與者遵守相關協議，便可以滿足「串謀」這項控罪元素。控方又指，不只可以透過外在行為（overt acts），案中亦有來自從犯證人的直接證據，證明協議的內容、如何達成協議，以及在國安法前後如何執行相關協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官押後至明早宣布決定&quot;&gt;官押後至明早宣布決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方均陳詞完畢，法官杜麗冰押後至明日上午（25日）宣布決定。若然法庭裁定黎就控罪表證成立，黎需決定是否作供及傳召辯方證人；相反，若然法庭裁定表證不成立，黎則毋須答辯，可當庭釋放。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，於2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀，請求外國或者境外機構、組織、人員實施對香港特別行政區或者中華人民共和國進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，指黎智英於2020年7月1日至今年2月15日間，與 Mark Simon、陳梓華、李宇軒、劉祖廸及其他人串謀，請求外國或境外機構、組織、人員，實施對中國或香港進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司於2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及/或複製煽動刊物，具意圖：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a) 引起憎恨或藐視中央或香港特別行政區政府或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b) 激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變其他在香港的依法制定的事項&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;c) 引起對香港司法的憎恨、藐視或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;d) 引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;e) 煽惑他人使用暴力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;f) 慫使他人不守法或不服從合法命令。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many in both communities feel that a peace process would simply allow the other side to buy time while pursuing more maximalist goals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you mention a peace process in Israel or the West Bank these days, you risk sounding naive at best and borderline treacherous at worst. Both communities are reeling, polls show support for a two-state solution is at an all-time low, and the Israeli Knesset has just passed a resolution rejecting a Palestinian state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the conflict isn’t going away and, at some point, engagement will again be necessary. When that time comes, the parameters cannot just snap back to the same issues that defined previous negotiations. Rather, they will need to take into account the sharply changed realities (and strikingly similar perceptions) in both communities. In my conversations with everyday Israelis and Palestinians on the ground, the same themes keep emerging – yet it’s clear that the two communities have never been further apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trauma&quot;&gt;Trauma&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Israelis and Palestinians are (again) navigating unprecedented traumas, and “trauma” is the word I’ve heard the most here this summer. The Israel–Palestine conflict has long been described as one of dual victimhood, with the state of Israel emerging in the aftermath of the Holocaust, along with the mass displacement of indigenous Palestinians in the Nakba, or “catastrophe”. The intergenerational trauma of those events still deeply pervades both societies, but the events themselves are recognised as historical events that predate the lives of most members of both populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 7 October attacks and the subsequent war in Gaza have brought those prior traumas surging back for the current generation. For Israel, 7 October not only marked the single deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, but also reanimated a sense of existential dread not felt in decades. Several people have told me that their overwhelming thought on the morning of the attacks was: “They are coming for us”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Gaza, meanwhile, is being experienced by Palestinians as the current generation’s Nakba: “What our grandparents experienced in 1948, it’s history. But what is going on now in Gaza is so shocking, because for us, it’s the first time to see this level of destruction, of ethnic cleansing, of mass killings”, one woman told me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As much as Israelis and Palestinians distrust their own leaders, they also distrust the other side’s, including the relative moderates who would be most likely to re-engage in a future peace process&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only are the twin traumas unfolding simultaneously, but each side has shrugged off the other’s suffering with a general response of “they deserved it”. “Even Palestinians who don’t support Hamas couldn’t help feeling a satisfaction on 7 October”, I’ve heard often, with polling reflecting the same sentiment. And most Israelis, across the political spectrum, support the war in Gaza. As one man told me, “There is a Jewish saying: if there are those who are coming to kill you, you kill them first. So what can we do?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;distrust&quot;&gt;Distrust&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Corrupt”. “Complicit”. “Selfish”. “Liars”. I haven’t met a single Israeli or Palestinian who trusts their current leadership – much less the other side’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than half of Israelis believe that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is prolonging the war for political reasons, and citizens across the ideological spectrum blame him for the failed policies and security lapses that, they believe, allowed the Hamas attacks to take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palestinians are equally frustrated with the ossifying Palestinian Authority (PA), which has long been seen as corrupt. But for most Palestinians I’ve spoken with, it is what they view as the PA’s complicity with Israel, via intelligence and security cooperation, that has most degraded any sense they might have of the body’s legitimacy. As one activist told me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People feel oppressed, we don’t have the power of political parties, and we feel we cannot do what we should do to support Gaza. Everywhere around the world, we see actions in solidarity with Gaza, or for a ceasefire. But here we cannot write a Facebook post, we cannot organise demonstrations or sit-ins, even within our own cities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as Israelis and Palestinians distrust their own leaders, they also distrust the other side’s, including the relative moderates who would be most likely to re-engage in a future peace process. Moreover, they distrust a peace process, believing such a process does little beyond allowing the other side to buy time while pursuing more maximalist goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An open letter published by Palestinians in Mondoweiss put it bluntly: “Make no mistake. The offers of a Palestinian state are an illusion”. Israelis I have met expressed similar views: “No matter what [PA president] Abu Mazen says, or a piece of paper says, most Palestinians will still just want to kill Jews. And they won’t stop, even if there is a Palestinian state”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;isolation&quot;&gt;Isolation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Palestinians and Israelis feel wholly marginalised by the international community. Despite sympathy from world leaders directly after 7 October, Israelis have since perceived a world turned increasingly hostile, from widespread student protests and unexpected boycotts to legal actions in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC). “It’s like the whole world has forgotten the atrocities of 7 October”, I’m often told.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also more pointed criticisms. A former IDF spokesperson I met was incredulous that the World Health Organization had not condemned Hamas’s infiltration of Gazan hospitals. In Tel Aviv, a main thoroughfare is lined with posters accusing UN Women of ignoring reports of widespread sexual violence on 7 October. When I asked women at the Hostages and Missing Persons Square why they thought that was, their answer was simple: “Because we’re Jews”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palestinians have felt equally marginalised. While international solidarity protests for Palestine are appreciated, there is frustration that government leaders, especially in the US, have continued to support Israel: “How can they just sit back and let a genocide continue for nine months?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the ICJ and ICC actions, while welcome, are seen by many Palestinians as double-edged swords, because of the lack of enforcement mechanisms. “On the one hand, the legal steps make people hope that justice might prevail”, a Palestinian human rights lawyer told me. “At the same time, when nothing happens after that, and the end result on the ground is nothing, people lose faith, not just in the court, but in the whole international system”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defiance&quot;&gt;Defiance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides are also more dug in than ever before – and confident that they can wait each other out. The phrase “from the river to the sea” became well-known for its deployment in pro-Palestine demonstrations, but I hear it invoked by Israelis just as much as by Palestinians – referring to full control of the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, including the West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite sympathy from world leaders directly after 7 October, Israelis have since perceived a world turned increasingly hostile, from widespread student protests and unexpected boycotts to legal actions in international courts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such aspirations are not new, but they are more widespread and vocalised now than in previous years. Moreover, both sides are increasingly convinced that they can win in a long-game demographic stand-off. Palestinians have long embraced the concept of sumoud, roughly translated as “steadfastness”, or a sense of perseverance and rootedness in the land. I’m often told, “We outlasted the British and the Ottomans and centuries of other foreign occupiers. We can outlast Israel too”. Among Israelis, the word I’ve heard the most in the post-7 October context is “resilience”. Despite some reports of emigration in the context of the war, the main sentiment here was summed up by one Israeli as, “We’re not moving. We are resilient and we won’t be bullied anymore”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extremists have, obviously, exploited those sentiments further. Far-right Israeli settlers, intent on retaking all of biblical Israel, have escalated campaigns of direct violence to expel Palestinians from more than a dozen West Bank villages since 7 October, attacks described to me by multiple Palestinians as “pogroms”. And many Palestinians support Hamas’s claim that the 7 October attack was “a necessary step and a normal response to confront all Israeli conspiracies against the Palestinian people”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, still many individuals, NGOs and movements – including family members of hostages and victims – who are committed to a (fledgling) peace movement. As one activist said, “Everyone wants things black and white, but as humans, we should be able to have empathy for the hostages and their families and also for civilians in Gaza. People want revenge, and it’s understandable, but we cannot lose our identity and our humanity in search of revenge”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most mainstream Israelis and Palestinians I’ve met do not see their hardened positions as motivated by revenge, so much as by survival. A new political vision, whenever it comes, will need to engage with these deeper fundamental realities if it’s going to stand a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brexit vote in June 2016 and subsequent decision by then-Prime Minister Theresa May to invoke Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union in March 2017, formally starting the process through which the UK left the EU, triggered a range of consequences for the UK. In the sanctions arena, this decision created the need for the UK to develop the necessary legislation to maintain existing sanctions regimes – and have the capacity to impose further sanctions – outside the laws and regulations of the EU. This work needed to be done rapidly to ensure the UK maintained its ability to implement and enforce sanctions once the exit process was complete. At the same time, the decision to leave the EU also created the opportunity for the UK to develop its own independent sanctions policy, acting unilaterally and at a different pace from its European neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the importance of the challenge and opportunity this presented, in May 2019, RUSI’s Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) created a taskforce on the “Future of UK Sanctions Policy”, which considered the post-Brexit design and coordination of sanctions, providing recommendations on how the UK should develop and implement its independent sanctions policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any strategy the UK may have been developing for the use of sanctions following the completion of the Brexit process was upended by the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the subsequent imposition of sanctions on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the significant challenges posed by the need to design, implement and enforce sanctions on Russia and the recent publication of the UK government’s sanctions strategy, RUSI has established a new taskforce to consider how the UK has addressed these challenges and what its independent sanctions policy might be in this dramatically changed sanctions environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the progress made, the challenges encountered and the lessons learned is vital for defining an effective future sanctions strategy for the UK to ensure the country is in the best possible position to create the desired impact of sanctions in an evolving threat landscape. This new UK Sanctions Implementation and Strategy Taskforce (the Taskforce), comprising 50 former government officials from the UK and elsewhere, senior sanctions executives from the financial sector and industry, and academics aims to evaluate the UK’s current sanctions policy and propose enhancements to its strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce held its inaugural roundtable in June 2024 to discuss the evolution of the UK’s independent sanctions policies post-Brexit, the preparation and changes required and the early use of an independent sanctions strategy. It then discussed the challenges posed, and changes necessitated, by the sanctions regime imposed on Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A second roundtable is scheduled for October 2024 to explore opportunities for strengthening existing frameworks and ensuring the UK’s sanctions strategy is fit for the geopolitical and emerging threat environment it faces today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report gathers the main findings from the June roundtable and assesses chronologically the establishment of the UK’s independent sanctions framework and the subsequent need to rapidly adapt in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. None of the comments made by the Taskforce members are attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uks-post-brexit-sanctions-response-201622&quot;&gt;The UK’s Post-Brexit Sanctions Response (2016–22)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable discussion first sought to understand the overall impact of the transition from an EU-based sanctions regime to the post-Brexit era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;establishing-an-independent-sanctions-framework&quot;&gt;Establishing an Independent Sanctions Framework&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Taskforce participants agreed that, while initially creating an atmosphere of uncertainty in the early stages of the process, Brexit had also given the UK government the flexibility and agility to shape its sanctions policy according to national priorities. After decades of implementing sanctions – apart from those relating to terrorism – as part of multi-country groupings within the UN and EU, the UK had the chance to introduce its own legal framework, leveraging the experience gathered while in the EU, as well as exploring the development of new sanctions regimes and accompanying narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce members from major financial institutions reported that the early days of the transition process were characterised by a sense of urgency among civil servants to establish the necessary legislation for imposing and implementing the UK’s own sanctions, due to a lack of certainty on the official departure date from the EU. The need for independent sanctions legislation resulted in the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (SAMLA), which facilitated the roll-over of the existing EU sanctions regimes, their applicability in the UK and the future capacity of the UK to make new designations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the urgency of the transition was over, the UK’s sanctions policy evolved beyond merely replicating EU sanctions. Former government officials at the roundtable noted that the UK had been a leading player in the development of the EU’s sanctions policies. With newfound independence, the government was able to leverage this experience, and introduce new sanctions regimes such as the Global Human Rights (GHR) Sanctions regime and the Global Anti-Corruption (GAC) Sanctions regime, and act with greater agility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce members acknowledged some of strengths of the post-Brexit UK regime. A former US government official, for instance, praised the UK’s role in facilitating transatlantic coordination with the EU and commended the country’s “political bravery” in implementing sanctions regimes that had previously been hindered by disagreements among EU member states pre-Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from the UK also acknowledged the relative strength of the UK’s post-Brexit legal framework. For example, one representative from the private sector noted that the legal framework is “broadly sensible” and functional, with statutory requirements for guidance enhancing its effectiveness, and an evidentiary threshold that is more consistently applied now that the UK is not in the EU – making listing decisions more robust. Another significant success singled out by the Taskforce was the introduction of the power to grant general licences, which greatly enhanced the flexibility and responsiveness of the sanctions regime, despite not being much used before February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While acknowledging the strength of the legal framework, some private sector representatives argued that the new independent regime created unease among businesses that now had to comply with yet another significant set of sanctions listings and implementation requirements and engage with new authorities such as the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OFSI was established in March 2016 and became operational in April 2017. Some participants mentioned that its slow start disappointed the private sector, contrasting its performance with the decades-old Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the US. Former US officials also stressed the differences in resourcing and behaviour between the US and the UK’s “sanctions machinery”, with the latter lacking the former’s size and “aggressiveness”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Taskforce members agreed that in the immediate period after Brexit, the UK had developed an effective sanctions framework based on the new SAMLA legislation and had gradually built its capacity to implement new regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introducing-new-autonomous-sanctions-regimes&quot;&gt;Introducing New Autonomous Sanctions Regimes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce explored one particular benefit of the UK’s independent sanctions policy – the autonomy to design and adopt new regimes. Although the UK now has 36 thematic and country regimes, the Taskforce discussion focused on two regimes in particular – the GHR sanctions regime of 2020 and the GAC sanctions regime of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the Taskforce participants agreed on the limited impact and scope of these two regimes. Overall, they described human rights and anti-corruption sanctions as “presentational”, with a strong messaging value at the international level, but limited impact on the targets or on UK businesses and their sanctions compliance obligations. Some recalled former Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab’s vision when establishing these regimes, as he sought to articulate the UK’s sanctions strategy as demonstrating “Global Britain’s commitment to acting as a force for good in the world”. However, they posited that these expectations have not been fully realised. The UK’s GAC and GHR sanctions have been underused, with only 42 and 123 designations respectively, in stark contrast to the proactive use by the US of its Global Magnitsky Sanctions, which includes 700 designations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limited application of GAC and GHR sanctions is not merely about numbers. Participants highlighted a lack of clarity and transparency regarding the criteria and purpose for which sanctions are deployed – or the strategy for their use – concluding that they are mainly used for signalling, with little expectation of behaviour change or justice being delivered. According to civil society representatives attending the roundtable, the inconsistency and perceived arbitrariness in the use of GAC sanctions undermine the legitimacy of the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also agreed that the deployment of thematic sanctions has been significantly hindered by the government’s focus on the Russia regime since February 2022. One Taskforce member suggested that without Russia’s invasion, the UK would have likely developed a clearer vision for its thematic regimes, citing the successful coordination with Canada and the US on Belarus’s GHR designations as an example of effective pre-2022 implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-new-sanctions-reality-after-february-2022&quot;&gt;The New Sanctions Reality After February 2022&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All participants recognised that the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022 had fundamentally altered the sanctions landscape and had a dramatic impact on the operations of private sector compliance departments across the UK. The Taskforce recognised that the UK had found itself on a steep learning curve, rapidly scaling up efforts to match heightened global expectations, particularly from the US, to ensure the effectiveness of G7 coordinated sanctions efforts against Russia. Among the positive developments stemming from these efforts, participants highlighted the significant injection of funds and resources in key agencies such as OFSI, increased parliamentary scrutiny to monitor the government’s performance and ensure accountability, and a designation process with a more consistent application of the evidentiary threshold than before 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statutory requirement for the government to provide guidance was, according to participants, another major advance, ensuring greater clarity on implementation as well as accountability and transparency from the regulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants acknowledged the UK government’s efforts to engage with industry at different stages of the sanctions cycle, despite encountering a series of challenges. For instance, they argued that co-designing sanctions had proven to be difficult due to their national security nature, citing the oil price cap as a unique example of industry involvement in shaping specific measures. Meanwhile, in supporting sanctions implementation, sanctions had dominated public–private partnership meetings, almost matching the focus traditionally placed on anti-money laundering in these forums. However, after this positive initial public–private engagement, some industry representatives observed a shift from collaboration towards an enforcement-focused approach, prompting businesses to seek legal protection when engaging with authorities, which in the view of some participants has been a backwards step in terms of a cross-sector approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants welcomed the increased use by the government of the power to grant general licences. This greatly enhanced the flexibility and responsiveness of the sanctions regime by allowing multiple parties to conduct certain restricted activities without the bureaucracy of obtaining individual licences. Prior to the invasion, OFSI granted only two general licences, while since February 2022 the number of general licences has reached more than 50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These features of the UK’s approach to sanctions post-February 2022, which were largely absent in the immediate post-Brexit period, have become central to the post-invasion sanctions landscape. Despite these advances, the Taskforce identified several deficiencies undermining the effectiveness and credibility of UK sanctions, which require government attention. These are set out in the following section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limited-resourcing-and-expertise&quot;&gt;Limited Resourcing and Expertise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce members discussed the shortage of resources and expertise in the relevant government sanctions departments. They described how the Russia regime required the hiring of new staff within government agencies, many of whom lacked the necessary sanctions knowledge. The urgency to address a backlog of licensing requests from businesses operating in the UK also led to a “conveyor belt” approach, which prioritised speed over development of expertise. This has prevented officials from developing a wider focus beyond UK domestic sanctions, resulting in many civil servants, who were working on sanctions, remaining too UK-centric in their approach, and consequently lacking in-depth knowledge about the regimes of G7 partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapid staff turnover also exacerbated these challenges. Government officials who have developed their expertise in sanctions have frequently transitioned to the private sector, attracted by better opportunities and remuneration. As reported by private sector representatives, even secondment initiatives intended to bolster expertise in the civil service often result in permanent moves away from public service, contributing to a persistent shortage of skilled personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lack-of-maturity-in-the-non-financial-sector&quot;&gt;Lack of Maturity in the Non-Financial Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-running experience of financial institutions in implementing sanctions facilitated their readiness to confront the new obligations presented by the Russia regime and engage with competent authorities. However, most Taskforce members agreed that the non-financial sector continues to display varying degrees of readiness and capability to comply with the new sanctions regime. Deficiencies in the sector often relate to a lack of the necessary technical knowledge, skills and resources, including basic awareness of sanctions risks, rather than wilful neglect. The non-financial sector is increasingly participating in public–private collaboration efforts and enhancing their expertise and capabilities, but the gap demands greater attention from the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quality-of-guidance&quot;&gt;Quality of Guidance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Taskforce members welcomed OFSI’s recent decision to publish an FAQs document and found it useful for understanding OFSI’s expectations. Yet, one participant suggested that clearer and more comprehensive guidance might eliminate the burden for regulators to provide FAQs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One participant highlighted that sanctions and related guidance still do not reflect the specific nuances of supply chains. This creates a substantial compliance burden for businesses to check whether listed small components or items are present in their supply chain. They gave as an example the requirements to comply with sanctions on materials such as titanium, which required businesses to trace the origins of small components, with uncertain benefits for the ultimate goals of sanctions. Despite the overall usefulness of guidance and complementary FAQs, a sanctions lawyer in the Taskforce also raised concerns about the legal standing of the guidance, highlighting recent UK court decisions which have emphasised the prioritisation of the statutory language of the sanctions regulations over any related guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;listing-and-delisting-criteria&quot;&gt;Listing and Delisting Criteria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal experts in the Taskforce criticised the current UK sanctions designation criteria for lacking clarity and rigorous standards, based on the low evidentiary threshold of “reasonable grounds to suspect”. Participants noted that UK courts have so far adopted an “arm’s length” approach when deliberating designation challenges, highlighting a prevailing trend in UK court rulings, viewing sanctions designations as a matter of government foreign policy with which they do not feel it is appropriate to engage, thus granting considerable leeway to the government in their sanctions decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most legal experts in the Taskforce highlighted the absence of an established delisting policy, leaving those sanctioned without recourse or explanation, further eroding the legitimacy of the sanctions regime. Some advocated for the introduction of clear, transparent criteria and procedures for lifting sanctions; these could include conditions such as divestment from problematic assets, cessation of activities linked to the Russian government, undergoing periodic independent audits, publicly supporting Ukraine, or criticising where possible Russia’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;combining-sanctions-with-criminal-justice-tools&quot;&gt;Combining Sanctions with Criminal Justice Tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants raised significant concerns about due process and the rule of law when combining sanctions with criminal justice tools, due to sanctions’ low evidentiary threshold and their basis in ministerial decisions. They noted a lack of differentiation between assets of individuals or businesses of Russian heritage and/or who have divested their assets from Russia, and individuals involved in illicit activities such as corruption, money laundering or sanctions evasion. Only the latter should be subject to asset confiscation, yet discussions often fail to make this distinction. Despite these challenges, Taskforce members recommended combining sanctions with other enforcement tools, particularly criminal investigations resulting in civil and criminal forfeitures. They suggested that this approach, if carefully implemented, could enhance the UK’s independent sanctions policy and global influence. A member of the legal sector recommended looking at the activities of the US Task Force KleptoCapture as a successful example of this model to prosecute illicit conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alignment-of-sanctions-regimes&quot;&gt;Alignment of Sanctions Regimes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While G7 countries aim for a unified approach to Russian sanctions, the Taskforce concurred that implementation varies between nations, leading to inconsistencies and challenges for international businesses. Private sector members reported that discrepancies in licensing and regulatory practices still existed between the US, the UK and the EU, causing operational disruptions. They emphasised the importance of alignment with international partners for the effectiveness of sanctions, the need to harmonise licences to simplify operations and mitigate diverging economic impacts, and the need for close coordination to minimise differences in sanctions regimes to avoid undermining collective efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lack-of-a-sustainable-vision&quot;&gt;Lack of a Sustainable Vision&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple Taskforce members highlighted their perception of the lack of a long-term vision in the UK sanctions strategy beyond the Russia regime. Most concurred that the current sanctions regime imposes a significant burden on businesses and regulators without necessarily achieving – or clearly evidencing – its intended objectives. For instance, despite its aim to disrupt Russian military trade flows, sanctions have not effectively curtailed Russia’s global procurement activities, but simply redirected them. Members from the private sector noted the challenge for the UK government of balancing competing political aims – for example, on the one hand, restricting finance and resources to Russia while on the other trying to maintain global energy supplies. This created a tension between political messaging of standing against Russia and the practical implementation of sanctions and licensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some participants suggested that the UK needs to reassess its strategy to ensure that sanctions are not only punitive but also effective and sustainable. They recommended the UK revisited or eliminated measures that create undue burdens without significant impact. This approach would allow the UK to focus on sanctions that genuinely hinder the targeted activities and adapt to a changing global landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After its departure from the EU, the UK embarked on an intensive journey to develop its independent sanctions policy. The full-scale invasion of Ukraine ushered in a new era, characterised by a rapid expansion and heightening of efforts, significant resource allocation, and a steep learning curve for government agencies. Despite these efforts, the Taskforce identified several deficiencies that the UK government must address to ensure the effectiveness and credibility of UK sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, the Taskforce highlighted as key issues: resources and expertise; engagement with industry; alignment with international partners; and a clear set of objectives for its sanctions policy. The Taskforce agreed that the UK will need to look beyond Russia sanctions to react to evolving geopolitical risks and emerging threats. The Taskforce will reconvene in October 2024 for an assessment of the future and vision of the UK and its sanctions regimes to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of its sanctions strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

China has been a leading partner in many Latin American space projects and the primary focus of U.S. interest in space activities in the region. While important in the context of U.S.-China competition, this approach proves limiting in understanding the real imperatives and constraints behind international space engagement in the region, whether with China or the many other nations with which Latin American countries collaborate in space. Understanding the complex domestic and foreign policy factors impacting these choices is essential for developing U.S. engagement strategies and policies that fully leverage the vital opportunities afforded by space activities in the context of U.S.–Latin American relations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space developments in Latin America remain relatively unknown to U.S. analysts and policymakers. One reason is that the outsized presence of China — responsible for the launch of over a dozen satellites on behalf of Latin American countries — is so often the focal point of English-language study of this topic. This analytical approach is typically framed as a chapter in the larger story of great power competition, with emphasis on strategic and security concerns given relative U.S. disengagement with the region. Yet it does little to explain why Latin American countries choose space-related partnerships with China — or, just as importantly, because the world has multiple spheres of influence and nations do not split cleanly into two sides, why they choose many other international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just about great power politics. Latin American actors operate in space as they do in other domains, with complex moves in both the domestic and foreign policy realms. When placed in a broader context that considers domestic constraints, as well as international foreign policy objectives, the complex modalities of international space engagement in the region — featuring civil and defense actors, civil society, academia, and industry — start to make more sense. For example, extensive Chinese-Brazilian collaboration to develop and operate the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) program has not prevented Brazil from making its proposed contributions to the United States’ Moon exploration program Artemis or participating in space security exchanges with the U.S. military. Instead, these reflect Brazil’s “universalist” approach to space cooperation, which echoes a foreign policy tradition of active nonalignment to keep all avenues of collaboration open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/o4rpBPJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It matters why and how Latin American space actors engage internationally. While Latin American countries’ choices in space partners are not simply an indication of attitudes toward the United States, these developments do have implications for U.S. strategic objectives, both in space and beyond. Oversimplifying these choices and failing to understand the drivers and constraints of space activities in the region risks the development of partnership strategies that fail to meet the needs of potential partners and are thus not seen as viable alternatives. It could also close the door on other opportunities beyond the realm of space. Efforts to advance U.S. objectives in the region would thus prove challenging and ineffective, with significant geopolitical implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, space activities are linked to some of the most pressing issues facing decisionmakers today, from national security to agricultural production in the face of climate change. Latin American countries have observed the experience of actors such as India, which has successfully integrated space into its national development agenda, and thus see the potential for space to serve as a cross-cutting tool to address national priorities. The successful integration of space tools and applications is therefore pivotal in addressing the key Latin American issues of today, whether to support efforts to curb illegal fishing, understand the Venezuela-Guyana territorial border dispute, or assess recovery after Rio Grande do Sul’s devastating floods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief captures findings from a yearlong study of the international engagement efforts of a subset of Latin American space actors through the lens of both domestic and foreign policy. It draws on extensive reading of primary and secondary sources in English, Spanish, and Portuguese; analysis of presentations and public remarks; and not-for-attribution interviews with government officials and other experts. The study fills a gap in the literature by shedding light on the broader context of space development in Latin America, where international cooperation has been central. Ultimately, this work seeks to contribute to the development of U.S. engagement strategies and policies that fully leverage the vital opportunities afforded by space activities in U.S.–Latin American relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brief first paints a broad picture of space development and international space engagement in Latin America. It then examines three case studies that exemplify different types of international engagement, discussing the domestic and foreign policy drivers and constraints impacting these efforts. The brief then closes by assessing the implications for U.S. policymakers, offering several recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-emerging-space-region&quot;&gt;An “Emerging” Space Region&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space activities are not new to Latin American countries. Space development in Latin America can be grouped into three general periods. The first began in the 1960s with Argentina and Brazil establishing space-focused entities and adopting a similar strategic approach to space as that of the United States, China, and the Soviet Union. Next, these early, largely military-led programs shifted to wholly civil or dual-use approaches in the 1990s amid the post–Cold War security landscape. The third and current phase exhibits important milestones across a wider set of countries and actors, such as universities and private companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stated priorities continue to focus on acquiring, leveraging, or developing space technologies for societal need, with a particular emphasis on telecommunications and Earth observation rather than human spaceflight. For instance, the head of the Brazilian Space Agency (AEB), commenting on potential Brazilian contributions to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s Artemis program, noted that while sending an astronaut to space “generates visibility,” it is “not the most important thing in the Brazilian space program. Its primary objective, from the beginning, is to generate benefits for society.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is “profound heterogeneity” in the region’s space activities, which nevertheless share basic principles — such as support for the core international space treaties — and often retain an operational and leadership role for the military. A discussion of the space-related milestones achieved by the many Latin American countries is beyond the scope of this paper. It is important to note, however, that these have included activity across the technology, institutional, and international cooperation domains since the beginning — such as Ecuador ratifying the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (one of the core international space treaties) in 1972 and Costa Rica hosting the first Space Conference of the Americas in 1990. The diversity and breadth of activity in Latin America exhibits the limitations of simply describing it as an “emerging” space region, which implies that there has been very little activity and only very recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/H2QgpeG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latin American countries’ international engagement on space issues has been a core tenet since the 1960s. As reflected in Brazil’s National Program for Space Activities, PNAE 2022–2031, international cooperation is both a means (to advance national space development) as well as an end (to strengthen strategic alliances). In addition, every one of the projects of Argentina’s National Space Activities Commission (CONAE) has been developed through international cooperation, according to its director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas discussion of international cooperation tends to highlight joint projects or bilateral development efforts, Latin American space engagement has notably featured leadership in international coordination and cooperation bodies. Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico were among the 18 member states of the 1958 UN ad hoc Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), which later become a permanent committee and remains central for information exchange and cooperation in the peaceful use of space. Via national subject-matter experts and through the UN Group of Latin American Countries, the region has had significant weight in multilateral space governance efforts. This includes Brazil chairing a 2019 COPUOS session at which members adopted a set of voluntary best practices for space activities and Chile chairing the 2022 UN-convened working group on space threats, which saw active engagement from several other countries in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, today’s space activities in Latin America are increasingly spreading to the nongovernment realm, with new business ventures, including start-ups, being stood up even in countries with no national space programs. Presenting a new set of challenges for how to govern space activities, multiple civil society and advocacy organizations have formed to support the Latin American space industry and address the constraints on entry into the global space market. Worthy of future research, this is yet another dynamic that illustrates shared regional conditions and challenges. Taken as a whole, the Latin American space landscape is complex, full of energy, and hosts a diverse set of space actors who continue to advance international partnerships and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-looks-at-international-space-engagement-in-latin-america&quot;&gt;Three Looks at International Space Engagement in Latin America&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign and domestic policy considerations motivate and constrain the space activities of Latin American nations in ways that impact the priorities and lines of effort (“what”), rationales (“why”), institutions involved (“who”), and implementation approaches (“how”) of such efforts. The following case studies examine different types of international engagement among several actors. Selected collaborations do not include China and cannot be explained by great power politics, thereby highlighting the complexities at play in Latin American space decisions beyond strategic rivalry. Additionally, while these efforts began with decisions made decades ago, they represent important developments shaping space activities today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;autonomy-and-dependency-in-chiles-national-satellites&quot;&gt;Autonomy and Dependency in Chile’s National Satellites&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unique among its neighbors, Chile opted to meet national security needs for data about its territory by sourcing Earth observation satellites commercially. The Chilean Air Force (FACh) used technology transfer contracts to procure its first national Earth observation satellites, FASat-Alpha and FASat-Bravo, from the United Kingdom’s Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. (SSTL), then the lead manufacturer of commercial small satellites for international customers. In 1998, it successfully orbited FASat-Bravo after FASat-Alpha failed to deploy in 1995. The satellite’s successor, FASat-Charlie, was procured from Europe’s Astrium (now Airbus Defence and Space, which owns SSTL) and launched in 2011. Registered under the Chilean flag, the satellites added highly prized experience in satellite operations to Chile’s existing knowledge base on the interpretation and use of images and data from air- and space-borne remote sensing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Chile announced a new national space effort. The National Satellite System (SNSat) would not just replace the aging FASat-Charlie but also include a national development component so that Chilean engineers would build the bulk of a new constellation of 10 small satellites. SNSat also includes plans to spread infrastructure and capacity more widely across Chile, helping address the development gap between Santiago and outer regions. Supported by an interministerial space council and a draft national space policy released for public comment in November 2023, SNSat attempts to address earlier calls for a national space program that meets national needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The differing narratives behind these efforts, however, demonstrate the disconnects among the major Chilean institutions involved in space activities and the limitations of a program housed in a branch of the armed services. In August 2023, the Ministry of Defense, FACh, and Senate of Chile hosted a conference on “national space sovereignty.” While this makes sense from a military standpoint, this was criticized by several Chilean experts interviewed because speaking of “sovereignty” is at odds with international space law, which Chilean diplomats have long promoted and which explicitly prohibits sovereignty claims in space. Rather than a concerted shift in policy, inconsistencies such as this reflect domestic divides between operational/military voices and diplomatic voices speaking independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The utilization of FASat-Charlie is also telling. A recent article found that Chile’s National Forestry Corporation (CONAF) did not use images from Charlie during the 2019–21 wildfire seasons, as had earlier been reported. Conversations with experts pointed to a combination of issues, including limited awareness of actual distribution channels, military restrictions on access, and the lack of a governance system to facilitate wider use. For example, FASat-Charlie was procured under a now-defunct law that allocated revenues from copper mining to purchases of materiel. With the satellite classified as a weapons system, it was required to remain within military control. In addition, the initial absence of guidelines to determine satellite tasking priority and distribution protocols for nonmilitary users frustrated civilians requesting imagery from FACh’s Aerophotogrammetric Service (SAF). Compounded by required user fees for SAF-processed data products, which added to both costs and delays, Chileans “turned elsewhere” to meet their satellite imagery needs, according to a former SAF official. Many governmental and private users turned to international sources of data, which could at times be acquired more quickly and cheaply. For example, Copernicus Chile, an imagery hub at the University of Chile, provides private and public institutions with data from the European satellite system Copernicus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This complicated landscape has shaped the approach to SNSat, which is built on a long-term ambition of increased technical autonomy, including access to assets that Chile does not develop independently. Before the June 2023 launch of FASat-Delta — the first microsatellite under SNSat — Chile celebrated the first successful download of images from a virtual constellation of 200 foreign satellites. Providing access to different data types (e.g., radar and multispectral images beyond the visible range), the arrangement provides continuity to FASat-Charlie while better serving nonmilitary applications such as scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, SNSat involves difficult trade-offs. In contrast to its predecessors, FASat-Delta is not operated by FACh but by its contractor, Israeli company ImageSat International. As co-owner, FACh has priority access to data from the satellite — but only through a service arrangement, rather than direct satellite tasking. Recent diplomatic tensions between Chile and Israel have raised concerns about potential impacts. In March 2024, President Gabriel Boric excluded Israel from participating in the International Air and Space Fair (FIDAE) in Santiago. This was consistent with the president’s criticisms of Israeli actions in Gaza, an issue that has drawn significant domestic attention in Chile, which has the largest Palestinian diaspora outside of the Middle East. Nevertheless, this move was widely criticized for risking the multidecadal alliance with Israel in the scientific and defense realm upon which Chile relies. “The government’s decision could leave Chile without its satellites, which is very serious from the point of view of controlling the country’s security,” said former officials in an interview. While the Chilean government confirmed that it had no intentions of severing relations, Israel pulled its military attaché from its embassy in Santiago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the diplomatic strife, FASat-Delta is already facing technical challenges. As of May 2024, 300 days after launch, Delta was not yet operational due to issues discovered during validation and testing. Furthermore, until a ground segment antenna is installed in Chilean territory, a required component for receiving signals from the satellite as it passes overhead, FACh will not be able to download images directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the time being, the delay in operations will increase users’ real and perceived reliance on external capabilities, complicating efforts to sustain the long-term political and resource investment required to execute the full vision for SNSat. In this landscape, leveraging frameworks such as the domestic space council to coordinate the apparently divergent national space communities will be essential for generating stakeholder buy-in. If successful at integrating space-related decisions into a larger national discourse, Chile’s experience will be helpful for other Latin American countries navigating the delicate balance between autonomy and dependency in space capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sabia-mar-south-south-competition-and-cooperation&quot;&gt;SABIA-Mar: South-South Competition and Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Argentina and Brazil reflects broad waves of “advances and setbacks, comings and goings” as each country navigates its perceived regional and international standing and the dependencies of a shared border. Likewise, space is “a lagging (not leading) indicator of bilateral relations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a period of intense distrust over concerns that the other nation was developing nuclear weapons, Argentina and Brazil reached a landmark bilateral solution to the nuclear question that paved the way for other collaboration. In 1989, Argentina and Brazil (now both under civilian rule) issued a joint presidential declaration calling space cooperation a “multiplying factor” in sustainable development. In 1996, shortly after establishing their own civil space agencies, the parties signed a framework agreement that has been repeatedly expanded and still guides their overarching space cooperation. From early integration and testing of Argentina’s Science Application Satellites series in Brazilian facilities to the use of Argentinean industry components on Brazil’s first homegrown satellite, Amazonia-1, the partners’ increasingly complex technical cooperation efforts are now focused on a major shared priority: water. With Argentina’s CONAE marking over 30 years of “looking at Earth from space” and Brazil’s efforts to manage its strategic maritime territory known as the Blue Amazon, the ocean-focused effort is a “natural partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a state visit to Buenos Aires in 2008, Brazilian president Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva issued a joint statement with Argentinian president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner endorsing the satellite project and noting the “strategic” nature of the bilateral relationship. Having evolved from an initial concept in 1998 which was further fleshed out in subsequent agreements, the Satellite for Applications Based on Environmental Marine Information (SABIA-Mar) project kicked off with the goal of developing two identical satellites for ocean monitoring and mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet each side did not make progress at the same rate. Significant resource constraints in Brazil were exacerbated by setbacks such as the delayed development of the Multi-Mission Platform (MMP), the satellite bus Brazil was to contribute to the project, and the 2013 failure of CBERS-3, a satellite in the joint program with China. To ensure the continuous flow of data, China and Brazil accelerated development of CBERS-4 by one year, drawing resources away from other projects. Thus, despite healthy relations between AEB and CONAE, Brazil had little to show for its part in SABIA-Mar a decade in, and its role in the project was uncertain. Tellingly, in the PNAE, Brazil’s 10-year space plan released in late 2021, SABIA-Mar was listed as a “proposed project” that could potentially use “spare parts” from another satellite. According to an expert then working at AEB, the agency conducted an internal review in 2021 on what had happened with the project and came up with options for consideration, including formal withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A combination of technical and political factors turned the tide in 2023. One of these was the success of Brazil’s first fully domestic satellite, Amazonia-1, which launched in 2021 and demonstrated the maturity of the MMP. On the political side, President Lula’s return to power in January 2023 overlapped with the end of President Alberto Fernández’s term (and consequently Fernández de Kirchner’s term as vice president), prompting a quick warming of relations. Intent on reengaging with allies after the “radical departure” of President Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil hurried to strengthen ties through high-level engagements that included cooperation on science and space in advance of a similarly dramatic change in leadership in Argentina later that year. At last, with Brazil recommitting to its participation in the project, the partners are working to field two satellites: SABIA-Mar 1 will be fully developed by Argentina and SABIA-Mar 2 will be Brazil’s responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these encouraging steps, SABIA-Mar’s future is uncertain. Resource commitments are in no way a given in Brazil, which invested only about a third of the monies required to execute space activities envisioned in its previous 10-year plan. Now under President Javier Milei’s administration, Argentina has significantly slashed government spending as part of austerity measures and maintains a tense relationship with Brazil — making it uncertain whether Argentina’s satellite will complete development by the 2026 target launch date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2008, during his speech in Buenos Aires, President Lula spoke of the bilateral alliance being “indispensable” to each country’s national goals and to the need to emphasize areas of agreement over the differences he acknowledged would always exist. Today’s tensions between Brazil’s and Argentina’s leaders increase the risk that these differences, while unlikely to threaten long-standing strategic interests, may overtake cooperative efforts, especially if problems arise that require diverting already limited resources. Analysts have pointed to the risks carried by recent visible, petty fights among Latin American leaders, noting that “multiple presidents fighting with each other as if they’re trying to win a reality show means that governing and cooperation do not occur.” While space is not going to play a leading role in the bilateral Argentina-Brazil relationship, the latest dispute between Presidents Milei and Lula could mean projects such as SABIA-Mar get caught in the crossfire as the relationship ebbs and flows over the coming years. Ultimately, if SABIA-Mar is successful, it will indeed be Latin America’s “most significant example of South–South cooperation,” not just because of complex technical demands but also due to the interplay of forces involved in maintaining this collaboration through the decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;latin-americas-esa&quot;&gt;Latin America’s ESA?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Latin American and Caribbean Space Agency (ALCE) was launched in Mexico City in 2021 at a session of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) presided by Mexico. Co-championed by Argentina, which has proposed a regional space entity in its national space plans since 2000, ALCE’s roots can be traced back to the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much has been written about Latin America’s expectations regarding the region’s long hoped-for counterpart to the European Space Agency (ESA), ALCE is just now on the cusp of beginning formal operations. Written into ALCE’s constitutive agreement is a requirement that at least 11 countries ratify it before it enters into force. Even as ALCE continues to garner signatories — 21 countries as of May 2024 — formal ratification has proven challenging. Reflecting on the challenges of clearing this “legal-diplomatic” hurdle, the Mexican representative to ALCE, Ambassador Gustavo Alonso Cabrera Rodríguez, lamented the confluence of institutional and political factors that has led to the significant delay. Speaking at FIDAE in April 2024, he wondered at the willingness of members to assign dedicated representatives, saying that without designated space institutions such issues default to the ministers of foreign relations and thus depend on “individual relationships.” This has meant that supporters have needed to actively promote the agency even among countries that have already committed to joining, making the formalization step lengthier and less certain. Nevertheless, with ratifications trickling in, reaching 10 as of May 2024, experts close to the effort confirmed that ALCE intends to launch formal operations by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues Cabrera Rodríguez raised regarding the formalization of the agreement ironically point to a problem ALCE is itself intended to resolve: the absence of an entry point for sustained regional cooperation. Not unique to the space realm, the lack of sustained political integration has been a persistent challenge for Latin America, which hosts over 30 regional organizations and forums, all with varying degrees of legitimacy. In contrast with Africa, which has rallied around the African Union as the most legitimate regional voice on several issues, Latin America has no such central representative body. Regional and subregional groups such as the Pacific Alliance and the Union of South American Nations wax and wane in relevance and tend not to represent the region’s views consistently or speak for all countries. CELAC itself was arguably created “as a counterweight to U.S. influence in the region,” an alternative to the Organization of American States (OAS), which includes both Canada and the United States. Similarly, while the idea of a regional space agency is old, there has not been consensus on its membership. Analysts have faulted “political grievances” for the decades-long delay in establishing ALCE and note Brazil’s absence — blamed on political differences — as a major weakness. Although Brazilian officials have spoken positively of ALCE, Brazil has not agreed to join on the basis that it was not a member of CELAC when it was negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important questions regarding how ALCE will finance its activities remain tied to the problem of sustaining domestic political support for it within member countries. As Cabrera Rodríguez said, it will be difficult to make investment in the agency attractive in a “scenario of scarcity or apparent scarcity.” Related challenges, such as the asymmetries of national space capabilities in the region, reflect a circular situation: ALCE may need to exist to create the necessary domestic support to sustain it. In some ways, it could help coordinate a space community with widely disconnected pockets of expertise, but only if national governments provide consistent support. ALCE is by nature a political effort and subject to the broader dynamics that have made regional integration a challenge — such as polarization and staunch support for sovereignty driven by a history of interventionism. There are already ideological differences that are reputedly preventing certain space nations, including Colombia and Ecuador, from joining ALCE. It is likely no accident that ALCE has been given a “coordinator role for regional space activities instead of a more political role.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interest ALCE has garnered from external partners is significant and only likely to increase as formal operations begin. The ESA and the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, among other space agencies, have already proposed collaboration with ALCE. In addition, “China is very interested,” said Cabrera Rodríguez in April and again in May during the first China-CELAC space forum, in Wuhan. ALCE has also been welcomed to the new Ibero-American Network of Aerospace Agencies, which is coordinated by the Organization of Ibero-American States and includes the Portuguese Space Agency. These nods of recognition, along with the persistent need for more stable institutions handling space topics, may continue to help boost the effort. ALCE is not Latin America’s ESA — but it could fill at least some of the need for integration on space issues in a region fraught with fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-implications-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Implications and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These examples serve as a reminder that space activities do not exist in isolation. Chile’s experiences with FASat and SNSat demonstrate how domestic constraints can create international positions and relationships that do not necessarily result from a determined foreign policy direction. SABIA-Mar shows an alternate scenario, wherein a project supported by a stable relationship at the institutional level is alternately buffeted and aided by higher-order shifts between the country’s leaders. Finally, the journey to an operational regional space agency, ALCE, reflects Latin America’s tortuous relationship with political integration even as it opens new avenues of external engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With space activities thus naturally rooted in domestic and regional realities, the analysis of Latin American international space engagement benefits greatly from looking beyond great power politics. Overall, Latin American countries have many options to meet their space technology and application needs, and a mix of factors (e.g., eager partners, competing domestic stakeholders, and foreign policy strategies such as hedging) will continue to be reflected in space alliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter for the United States? U.S. national space policy highlights the need to expand the country’s space alliances. The bipartisan objectives articulated in the 2020 National Space Policy, the 2021 U.S. Space Priorities Framework, and the 2022 National Security Strategy include diversifying strategic partnerships with emerging and middle space powers and strengthening global governance of space activities in line with U.S. principles. But the United States should change the way it approaches these issues with potential new partners. It cannot be guided solely on the assumption that geopolitical imperatives drive Latin American space partnerships, rendering space as just a way for nations to pick sides in the U.S.-China rivalry. The United States needs to recognize that the complex space alliances prevalent in Latin America are not simply a function of its own actions but a reflection of the interplay of numerous countries’ domestic and foreign policy drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this, U.S. space engagement in the region should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demonstrate a whole-of-government approach to bilateral engagement across Latin America.&lt;/strong&gt; Due to impermanent roles surrounding space, a single, national point of contact often does not exist among Latin American actors. Coupled with patchwork institutional frameworks that exacerbate gaps among the communities involved in space, U.S. partners may find that there are many different, even contradictory positions on space issues and that no single decisionmaker is able to drive forward an effort. Moreover, there is a proliferation of dual-use programs that serve both civil and defense needs, reflecting the already blurred lines between civil, defense, and commercial space efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, U.S. engagement with its Latin American counterparts tends to be siloed — with civil space visits on the one hand and military-only discussions on the other, even while both seek expanded collaboration. In nations such as Chile that lack a civil space agency comparable to NASA and that are pursuing dual-use programs involving civil and defense entities, limiting conversations to U.S. civil space agencies or to U.S. defense agencies is risky. This severely limits the effectiveness of relationship-building efforts intended to develop shared understanding on space issues and ultimately advance common priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The somewhat fractured nature of some of the space communities in Latin America should not deter U.S. engagement but instead invite an integrated whole-of-government approach, as called for in the U.S. Strategic Framework for Space Diplomacy. The United States should build on existing successes — such as the Space Force’s bilateral data-sharing agreements on space situational awareness, as well as civil space agencies’ leadership in the regional Earth observation collaboration framework, AmeriGEO — to better integrate space issues into its broader relations with regional partners. This engagement could be modeled after the comprehensive dialogues the United States has held on space with important allies such as France and Japan. Even if it is not appropriate to elevate certain Latin American relationships to that level, this approach could inform engagement with key security partners such as Colombia or economic partners such as Mexico and Chile. In addition to facilitating collaboration across the U.S. agencies already engaged in Latin America, this would enable the United States to contribute subject-matter expertise and resources from across the government, modeling the kind of effective institutional coordination that strengthens the U.S. space program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand engagement to other multilateral settings, even ones not dedicated to space.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should better leverage other regional forums and venues, such as the OAS and the Summit of the Americas, to create sustained engagement on space topics. Knowing that the opportunities and risks associated with space technology are not widely recognized across the different decisionmaking communities in Latin America, U.S. decisionmakers should not assume that space capabilities are being leveraged or even considered as part of collective efforts on issues such as cybersecurity, public health, or food insecurity. More consistent integration of space-related applications by U.S. agencies involved in these efforts can help foster important stakeholder connections on the Latin American side, drawing leaders’ attention to space and benefiting even communities with few or no dedicated space institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A more intentional engagement strategy that takes space discussions beyond the usual venues also presents an opportunity to counter China’s extensive reach in formal and informal regional forums. For instance, China’s engagement with CELAC, an organization it prefers because it excludes the United States, includes a space element. The recently expanded BRICS alliance, which evolved from an economic-oriented grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa into a larger political and economic forum, has also gained relevance in the space domain. From coordination projects such as the BRICS Joint Committee on Space Cooperation, which was announced in 2021 and is intended to enable satellite data sharing, to statements on space sustainability and space security in the 2024 BRICS declaration, it is clear that members see the alliance as a legitimate forum to align on space issues. To enhance coordination and collaboration with like-minded Latin American space nations, the United States should adopt a more agile engagement strategy that consistently includes space on the regional agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand collaboration on national space governance topics.&lt;/strong&gt; Since security considerations mean technology transfer arrangements may not be on the table for U.S.–Latin America collaboration, the United States should expand efforts in other substantive areas informed by the unique dynamics of the region. This should include national governance — the combination of policy, law, and regulation, supported by institutional frameworks — of space activities. The inconsistencies and misalignments referenced in this report sometimes result from gaps in these areas and threaten both the successful implementation of national programs and efforts to elevate space in the list of priorities. Licensing regimes for commercial space efforts, the development of mechanisms for regular engagement with nongovernment actors, and research-to-operations strategies that enhance adoption of government-funded science are among the many governance topics ripe for bilateral and multilateral dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States can draw on its experience with Latin American nations but also involve partners such as Canada to share perspectives on adopting governance models tailored to a different government structure and that seek different goals. These topics — while not as headline-worthy as joint hardware development projects — are a natural extension of the region’s substantial support for important U.S.-led space-governance efforts such as the Artemis Accords. In elaborating on how such principles are put into practice in a way that can account for the unique challenges of countries in the region, such collaboration could help advance national governance in Latin America, thereby advancing space development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International space engagement in Latin America is not about apolitical calculations driven by technological needs, nor does it represent just another front in the U.S.-China great power rivalry. It is instead a landscape where complex domestic and foreign policy factors interact to both motivate and constrain the choices Latin American countries make about space activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges at hand for the space programs in Latin America do not correspond simply to a lack of funding or technical know-how. Ultimately, for space activities to help advance national priorities, they should be rooted in the domestic and international policy strategies of each nation. To be a strong ally and meet its own strategic objectives in space and in Latin America, the United States should shift how it approaches its regional space engagement. The considerations and recommendations in this brief can inform enhanced strategic partnerships, including cooperation on new areas such as developing institutional frameworks and bringing space discussions outside of traditional space forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Latin American space landscape is complex, but it is one that potential partners in the United States can navigate. As a leading regional expert argued recently, among the advantages the region presents for the United States is that it is both “far” from global conflicts and “near” U.S. markets. Space collaboration presents a valuable opportunity to bring the United States and Latin American partners closer — contributing to relationships that are stronger, more strategic, and better positioned to address the shared challenges of today and tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the main thrust of Russia’s anticipated summer offensive underway, it is an opportune moment to take stock of the significant and underappreciated changes that have taken hold in Moscow’s approach to cyber operations in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much Western analysis to date has fixated on Russia’s highly visible opening cyber offensive, the merits of its approach, and the potential for a renewed destructive campaign of a similar nature against Ukrainian critical infrastructure. This focus is misplaced, however, and has anchored Western understanding of the war’s cyber dimensions to Russia’s countervalue strategy to amass societal pressure via the widespread sabotage of computer networks – an approach that has not seen primacy since the invasion’s first year when assumptions about a short war still guided Russia’s theory of victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The harsher reality is that Russia’s intelligence services have adapted their posture in cyberspace to the demands of a long war. Mounting evidence, stretching back to the months preceding Ukraine’s counteroffensive in 2023, indicates that multiple Russian cyber units have shifted their sights away from strategic civilian targets toward soldiers’ computers and mobiles endpoints in order to enable tactical military objectives on Ukraine’s frontlines. This change in operational focus has been cross-cutting, with Russian military intelligence (GRU) and the domestic security service (FSB) – long renowned for rivalry and mistrust – unifying their earlier disjointed cyber efforts and systematising a series of tradecraft adaptations intended to increase their military effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a relative shift in priorities rather than a complete overhaul of Russia’s wider strategy. There remain patterns of operational activity indicative of sustained interest in Ukrainian critical infrastructure objects that would hold no immediate intelligence value, and therefore likely represent preparations for future sabotage. What is clear, however, is that Moscow has rebalanced its overarching concept of operations to emphasise targets that can provide more direct and tangible battlefield advantages to its conventional forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These adjustments are not solely a reflection of Russia’s scaled-down ambitions in Ukraine, nor how its wider perception of Kyiv’s centre of gravity have changed over the past two years as the conflict intensified into a war of attrition. They are also an important signal of how Russia’s intelligence services have adapted their thinking about how to optimally integrate cyber and conventional capabilities after two years of high-intensity engagement, and what the coming months may bring as Russia makes a new push in eastern Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-tactical-pivot&quot;&gt;Russia’s Tactical Pivot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The refocusing of Russia’s cyber campaign to meet what is almost certainly an increasing demand for tactical-relevant signals intelligence (SIGINT) has largely fallen into a few main lines of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beyond targeted efforts to gain access to devices and systems used by Ukrainian soldiers, Russia has also reoriented its cyber forces to help locate Ukrainian military equipment and positions&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first has been penetrating devices used by Ukrainian soldiers at the front. Not only has Kyiv’s emphasis on “data-driven combat” made smartphones an invaluable source of location data to establish patterns of movement and locate and target Ukrainian positions, but the military’s dependence on free encrypted messaging applications (EMAs), such as Signal for secure operational communication, has made the ability to eavesdrop on these devices of paramount importance for both the GRU and the FSB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge for Moscow is that collecting these types of signals is not a trivial feat at scale. The cryptographic protocols used by popular EMAs have withstood rigorous public scrutiny, and it is unlikely Russia’s services are capable of quietly breaking them. Phones at the front are also unlikely to be connected to mobile networks where geolocation and other signals can be reliably collected upstream through compromised telecommunications infrastructure or by electronic warfare capabilities. This has driven the intelligence services to adopt a few operational concepts to fill this critical collection gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One method has been conventional attempts at full-device compromise using malware, more often than not, disguised as applications used by the Ukrainian military. While this tradecraft is not altogether new – the GRU first altered a Ukrainian app to geolocate artillery units in 2016 – the masking of malware as versions of mobile applications has increased significantly in response to Kyiv’s suite of software-driven military innovations. These operations have generally relied on highly tailored social engineering, repurposing legitimate military communications, and directly interacting with targets over Signal and Telegram chats to build rapport before delivering the malicious applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other more novel method has been to siphon messages through the device-linking feature built into common EMAs. One Russian military-affiliated unit has dedicated its focus to social engineering Ukrainian soldiers into linking Russian-intelligence controlled instances of EMAs including Signal, Telegram and WhatsApp to their accounts. Similarly focused FSB operations have centred on exploiting systems already linked to Ukrainian soldiers’ phones. According to Microsoft, cyber operators linked to Center 16, the FSB’s main SIGINT unit, have shown a specific interest in stealing files containing messages from the Signal Desktop application, providing them access to the target’s private Signal conversations and attachments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, the GRU is also engaged in the close-access exploitation of mobile devices and other systems captured by Russian forces on the battlefield to achieve similar access. Here, cyber operators have begun to technically enable their counterparts within the Russian military to independently initiate the collection of intelligence from Ukrainian devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the author’s Mandiant research has highlighted how the GRU’s Main Center for Special Technologies (GTsST), commonly known as APT44 or Sandworm, has provided dedicated infrastructure and technical instructions to Russian ground forces so that they can exfiltrate Telegram and Signal communications from captured devices at the front. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has similarly reported on Sandworm using captured devices as a foothold to deliver malware known as Infamous Chisel to penetrate military networks and gather data on connected Starlink terminals and the suite of specialised applications used by the Ukrainian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major line of effort has been to penetrate the digital systems used by the Ukrainian army for command and control, situational awareness and other operational needs. It is no secret that digitised battlefield management systems like Delta and Kropyva have been a critical enabler of information and combat advantages for the Ukrainian army. In fact, Moscow has perceived these systems to be so effective that it has undertaken efforts to develop exact replicas for the Russian military. Unlike attempts to deliver malware disguised as these applications to compromise endpoints, this category of operations has instead focused on tricking soldiers to give up their credentials, providing Russia’s services a surreptitious lens into Kyiv’s common operational picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond targeted efforts to gain access to devices and systems used by Ukrainian soldiers, Russia has also reoriented its cyber forces to help locate Ukrainian military equipment and positions. The SBU has warned of Russian efforts to control compromised webcams in population centres to locate Ukrainian air defences and other critical infrastructure objects and feed targeting data into its reconnaissance-strike complex. Dutch military intelligence has similarly alerted publics to the overall refocusing of Russia’s cyber campaign, highlighting operations designed to locate and map military positions and equipment for later physical seizure. Those providing assistance to Ukraine should factor in the potential risks of this cyber-enabled surveillance activity, as the intensifying campaign of sabotage across Europe strongly indicates that insight into Western military supply chains is a clear collection priority for Russia’s intelligence services at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, each of these new operational concepts point to a deepening two-way relationship between Russian cyber and conventional forces, and the extension of their early coordination efforts to now encompass both strategic and tactical objectives. What’s more, they signal that for specific operations, Russian cyber elements have likely also moved closer to the front to capitalise on the short-lived tactical intelligence that these mobile devices might provide. Looking forward, it is reasonable to expect further adaptations and operational concepts to arise from this closer relationship as the war continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-ukraine-and-nato&quot;&gt;Implications For Ukraine and NATO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main takeaway for Western policymakers is that mobile devices have become a critical centre of gravity for Russia’s cyber campaign in Ukraine. The war’s technology-dense and sensor-rich frontlines have placed a premium on the ability to collect signals from soldiers’ devices and the digital networks that connect them. With new technologies continuing to shape the battlefield and drive tactical innovations on the front lines, these types of operations are only likely to grow more common as the war continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s impressive defensive feats aside, Russia’s adapted force employment demands renewed attention on how to best sustain international support for Ukraine’s cyber defences&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is important to recognise is that this is a fundamentally different technology environment where earlier lessons about the capacity of governments and the private sector to support Ukrainian cyber defences are less likely to hold. Visibility into sensitive military networks and mobile devices is much more opaque, virtual incident response is more difficult, and fewer defensive partners are likely to have capabilities readied for this type of security assistance. Ukraine’s impressive defensive feats aside, Russia’s adapted force employment demands renewed attention on how to best sustain international support for Ukraine’s cyber defences. This is especially important now that other emerging threats are increasingly consuming limited intelligence resources and attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally as important, we must begin to acknowledge that the second-order consequences of these espionage operations can be grave. Take, for example, the lethal strike on Ukraine’s 128th Mountain Assault Brigade in November 2023 that was traced back to the penetration of a soldier’s Signal account. At a time when conventional wisdom has grown dismissive about the military benefit that cyber operations have afforded Russia, it is important that we carefully consider the implications of this mission realignment and what it portends about cyber’s expanding role in kinetic, conventional operations now that attrition is the key element of Russia’s strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malicious linked devices will continue to provide intercepts even when phones are disconnected, destroyed or otherwise inactive, as Signal messages do not need to route through the target’s phone to be delivered to a linked device. Communications will therefore still reach Russian operators even when they will not necessarily reach the intended Ukrainian recipient. As one Ukrainian expert puts it, if “a soldier from a battalion group gets captured or dies, his phone falls into the hands of the enemy, and the Russians read all the correspondence in this group for another month”. The long-tail impact of these operations can be severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should also be prepared for Russia’s new operational concepts to proliferate outside of Ukraine. Today, Signal and other EMAs have become standard practice for sensitive communications. These applications see ubiquitous use by Western militaries, politicians, civil-society groups, and other common targets of Russia’s intelligence services. Russia’s war-focused tactics could therefore reasonably see wider use to fulfil other urgent intelligence requirements, such as the collection of foreign political intelligence from Ukraine’s partners, or in potential efforts to influence one of the many consequential Western elections on the horizon. If history has taught us anything, it’s that Russian tradecraft rarely stays confined to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Sir Keir Starmer’s cabinet sets about establishing what Labour policies mean in government for the first time in more than 14 years, his ministers will find there are some issues that will prove as thorny in government as they did in opposition. When it comes to foreign policy, one such example would be the Middle East; and when it comes to the Middle East, one such example would be Israel and the Palestinians. Israel’s war on Gaza has gone on for more than nine months, following the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023, with the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, stating that civilians in Gaza are being pushed into, “ever deeper circles of hell”, due to the ensuing humanitarian situation arising from the Israeli campaign. On 7 July, David Lammy, the UK’s new foreign secretary, said that the UK seeks a “balanced position” on the current situation. How might that look on Israel–Gaza, and Israel–Palestine more generally?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uk-and-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict&quot;&gt;The UK and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the last Conservative period of government, from 2010 until this year, relations between Israel and the UK reached an apex of support signified by a 2030 roadmap agreement signed in 2023, establishing widespread cooperation in a variety of fields. At the same time, the British government’s official position on Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories remained transparent; repeated declarations by London indicated its view that international law considered East Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank to be occupied territory, and settlements therein illegal. (Indeed, a Conservative minister of state, Alan Duncan, spoke at RUSI in 2014 to make this point quite clear.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last year has been a challenging one for British interests in the region; the 7 October attack on Israel, followed by Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, raised the threat of regional conflict, be it between Israel and Iran, Israel and Lebanon, as well as other theatres. As this author has mentioned with regard to Europe in another brief: a stable wider Arab world is in the UK’s ultimate interest; a wider Arab world and Middle East region in turmoil is precisely the opposite. Indeed, due to British interests being affected, the UK committed the use of force in the Red Sea against the Houthis, as a result of the latter’s escalation on international shipping lanes in the Red Sea – an escalation that would not have taken place had the war in Gaza been averted, or a ceasefire come to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, London’s diplomatic capital internationally is being impacted by the perception that the UK’s commitment to the “rules-based order” is not as absolute as it proclaims, because of the assessment that the UK has been lacking in balance vis-à-vis Israel–Palestine. As one G7 diplomat told the Financial Times months ago, “What we said about Ukraine has to apply to Gaza. Otherwise we lose all our credibility”. The UK stands in need of more, not less such diplomatic capital, with all the challenges on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;immediate-future-aid-and-arms-sales&quot;&gt;Immediate Future: Aid and Arms Sales&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the immediate future, the restoration of UK funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), announced by the Foreign Secretary on Friday 19 July, is a welcome step that ought to be followed up by British moves to improve aid transfers to the Palestinian occupied territories. Criticisms by the former Conservative government about the difficulty to get aid into Gaza due to Israeli obstacles remain valid; restoration of support to UNRWA is necessary to reduce the humanitarian crisis, but there remain other difficulties to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another near-term topic that is likely to come up again quite soon is that of arms sales to Israel by the UK. While it is true that such arms sales represent a small proportion of arms transfers to Israel, as the former foreign secretary Lord Cameron pointed out, such a point is immaterial to HMG’s legal obligations. Under the UK’s strategic export licensing criteria (SELC), London is required to prevent the transfer of military equipment where there is a clear or overriding risk that such equipment might be used to facilitate a serious violation of international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While London is not in the business of telling the Israeli population how to vote, the British government should make clear to its ally what its own values are&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 130 parliamentarians in the last parliament argued this was already the case, joining many different human rights and aid organisations. Crucially, the Foreign Affairs Committee chair in the last parliament, Alicia Kearns, repeatedly raised the issue of whether or not export licence applications for Israel have been referred to ministers over the past year. If the UK were to take the step of suspending or restricting such export licences, they would be joining a number of their allies; Belgium, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Canada, Italy, and Spain have already done so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it may be that HMG legal advice has already recommended such a step. When in opposition, Foreign Secretary Lammy criticised the then Conservative-led government for not publishing the legal advice provided; it would be prudent for him to do so now, in order to show that a page has been turned in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the short-term decisions, this is perhaps the most difficult, because it would place the UK in a place different from its close allies in the US, France and Germany. Simultaneously, it is important to note that previous British governments, including those of David Cameron, Gordon Brown, Tony Blair, and Margaret Thatcher, all suspended arms sales to Israel on different occasions – the precedent has already been set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;medium-term-the-icc-and-palestine-recognition&quot;&gt;Medium Term: the ICC and Palestine Recognition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the medium term, there are two critical areas that are likely to be raised. The first relates to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the ICC prosecutor general, Karim Khan. Prominent US Republican politicians, including the newly announced candidate for the US vice-presidency, J D Vance, have called for sanctions against and an investigation into Khan, as a result of the latter’s calling for arrest warrants against Israeli officials. The Biden administration has also confirmed it wants to work with Congress to penalise the ICC. As a signatory of the Rome Statute that established the ICC, in addition to the fact that Khan is a British citizen, the UK ought to vigorously defend the ICC and the prosecutor general. London’s discreet challenge against ICC jurisdiction over Israeli officials, lodged in the last weeks of the last government, should be withdrawn; its continuation, particularly given the weak legal basis and existing challenges against the ICC, would be viewed as lacklustre support for the ICC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second medium-term issue pertains to immediate recognition of the State of Palestine, which was, until relatively recently, a Labour policy. Labour has now changed that policy to indicate that recognition will happen as part of a peace process, rather than at the conclusion of that process, and that Labour was committed to such recognition. The reluctance to immediately recognise the State of Palestine is primarily due to a desire to avoid a rift with US President Joe Biden, which is understandable given London’s overarching security architecture. But it is not a foregone conclusion that London’s recognition would create a rift of any consequence with Washington DC. A total of 144 of the 193 member states of the UN already recognise the State of Palestine, including a majority of European states – their relations with Washington DC have been unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is: given the option of recognition, should the UK still resist it? British recognition of a Palestinian state would not immediately bring one into existence, so one could argue it is merely symbolic, and hardly consequential. The opposing argument is that recognition by the UK is qualitatively different than many other countries, given London’s historic role in the Israel–Palestine question. When Norway recognised a Palestinian state earlier this year, it was essentially stating that Oslo no longer believed in the Oslo Peace Process. The more such political messages are sent, the more pressure there is for a political process to be reinvigorated, rather than the continuation of an unstable status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;long-term-uk-political-convergence-and-divergence-on-israelpalestine&quot;&gt;Long term: UK Political Convergence and Divergence on Israel–Palestine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are longer term issues that the UK will have to address. The developing nature of the Israeli political spectrum has seen over the past decade a widening and mainstreaming of the Israeli far-right, with not only attitudes hardening on the margins, but in the centre. The latest such example was the near-entirety of the Israeli Knesset voted against Palestinian statehood, and thus the two-state solution itself, on the 18th of July; a political settlement that the international community, including the UK, has rallied behind for decades. Extreme radical views are expressed not only by members of far-right political parties, but also within traditionally centre-right ones, such as Likud. While London is not in the business of telling the Israeli population how to vote, the British government should make clear to its ally what its own values are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;London should consider re-evaluating the 2030 roadmap agreement that was signed with Israel in 2023&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, the sanctions regime that the UK FCDO has, and which it instituted against two extremist groups in Israel in May, should be widened. The settlement movement in the West Bank has not been infiltrated by extremist elements that need to be isolated; rather, the settlement movement is in itself an illegal enterprise, supported by the Israeli government and military. British courts, British politicians and the British government have made it abundantly clear on numerous occasions that East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza are all occupied territories, and that the occupying power is the State of Israel. HMG policy should make it clear that settlement activity writ large ought to result in sanctions. Moreover, as the ICC and International Court of Justice (ICJ) investigations continue, it is likely that there will be Israeli, as well as Hamas figures, that are sanctioned or the subject of arrest warrants. London should prepare for this, as it is likely that highly senior figures in the Israeli government will be affected, and London ought to make it clear that it upholds the independence of both the ICC and the ICJ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London already has a strongly effective system of restrictions and sanctions with regard to Hamas and support for terrorism, via legal and political measures, and little more seems necessary in that regard. However, in coordination with particularly European allies, which has substantial leverage with regard to the Palestinian Authority owing to existing EU aid packages, the UK should focus on “more for more”; not by threatening a withdrawal of aid, particularly at a time of tremendous suffering, but by proposing increased access to European and British markets for Palestinian trade, in exchange for improvements in governance by Palestinian authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the ongoing widespread concerns around violations of international humanitarian law, London should furthermore consider re-evaluating the 2030 roadmap agreement that was signed with Israel in 2023. That agreement has significant impact on bilateral relations on military support and trade, among a wide variety of other fields. Given that Israel is currently in the dock at the ICJ for genocide charges, a suspension of the agreement until the outcome of the case at least, would seem prudent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the UK, while remaining aware and humble about its ability to directly impact the situation on the ground, should nonetheless recognise its tremendous indirect leveraging power. The UK enjoys a privileged relationship with the US, which has the most direct consequential impact on the Israel–Palestine question. London also has extensive and deep contacts with Arab states that are extremely important with regard to the conflict, particularly Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the UAE. If the US were to use the leverage it has over the Israelis, and Arab states were to simultaneously use their leverage over the Palestinians, the prospects for a genuine and sustainable peace settlement in Israel–Palestine would be far easier to materialise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been ongoing for decades, and it is tempting to see it as an unsolvable foreign policy issue. But such defeatist thinking led to the political dynamic that eventually led to the terrible events of 7 October, and sent the region into a deeply dangerous spiral of escalation and violence. UK national security interests stipulate that London further prospects for a wider peace in the region, if only to hold back the possibility of wider escalation of violence, and corresponding impacts on British interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2021, to mark the 50th anniversary of China’s entry into the UN, Foreign Minister Wang Yi boasted of China’s peacekeeping efforts, highlighting that the country had fulfilled its pledge to establish an 8,000-member standby peacekeeping force, participated in 29 former and ongoing peacekeeping operations, and contributed more than 50,000 personnel. Wang declared, “China has met its responsibilities for upholding world peace. Over the past 50 years, China has taken the side of fairness, upholding equality and opposing interference in other countries’ internal affairs, power politics and hegemonism”. He emphasised that China’s active involvement was a major departure from its longstanding policy of not participating in UN peacekeeping missions, which – from Beijing’s point of view –strategists and policymakers had underappreciated for too many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By most accounts, the international community widely appreciates China’s growing contribution due to the unprecedented demand for UN peacekeeping. Today’s peacekeeping missions are increasingly complex in terms of the scale and scope of their mandates. However, China’s expanding role in peace operations highlights its growing prominence within the UN. This development directly challenges the US’s strategic influence and its broader role as leader of the rules-based international order. It is essential to recognise that peacekeeping, stabilisation and large-scale combat operations are not mutually exclusive. Instead, peace operations should be viewed through the lens of strategic competition which the US government can use to its advantage while assisting populations in need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;growth-of-chinese-peacekeeping-activities&quot;&gt;Growth of Chinese Peacekeeping Activities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 24 years, China has significantly expanded its participation in UN peacekeeping missions. In 2000, the country provided fewer than 100 personnel to all peace operations. Now, Beijing is the 10th largest troop and police contributor (2,274 personnel) of any country and the second largest financial supporter, providing nearly 19% of UN peacekeeping programme funding (see Figure 1). Moreover, China provides more peacekeepers to UN operations than all the other UN Security Council permanent members combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2O3pPR9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Chinese Troop and Police Contributions to UN Missions, 2000–2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these contributions may appear positive for the overall UN peacekeeping agenda, China – like other countries – is motivated out of self-interest to advance its foreign policy objectives. Strong participation in UN peace operations is an ideal way for China to gain on-the-ground operational experience abroad, build multilateral cooperation, improve bilateral relations and advance a positive image domestically and worldwide. Also, China’s peacekeeping efforts appear to match its resource investments and economic interests, particularly in Africa, where more than three-quarters of Chinese nationals on UN missions are deployed. Beijing has progressively linked these deployments to protecting its interests and citizens on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, other significant factors may influence China’s peacekeeping activities apart from its economic interests, as suggested by data collected from 2012–2018 by Lucy Best. While China has disproportionately deployed peacekeepers in areas where it has commercial interests, investment levels do not necessarily lead to increased personnel counts. This implies that other factors could be at play in China’s decision to participate in peacekeeping missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its growing troop and financial commitments, China established its Peacekeeping Affairs Centre in 2018 to coordinate international cooperation and manage its UN peacekeeping troop deployments, and is actively involved in leading peace training workshops and seminars. Through these efforts, China is gradually pressing for normative changes in UN peacekeeping that align with its more technocratic and state-centric vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, China has been seeking to secure senior political and military peacekeeping leadership posts in the UN Department of Peace Operations (UNDPO), and it is alleged that Beijing wishes to supplant France as the head of the department – a position French diplomats have filled since 1966. To this end, China is building its depth of qualified personnel, as 13 of its military officers have held top UN operational peacekeeping positions, serving either as a force commander, deputy force commander, sector commander or deputy sector commander. If the assertions about Beijing’s ambitions prove correct, China could over time gain the experience and access needed to prioritise its interests to the detriment of US foreign policy objectives and Western peacekeeping norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Strong participation in UN peace operations is an ideal way for China to gain on-the-ground operational experience abroad&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2023, Beijing distributed a short English-language promotional film on its Ministry of National Defense website (and on YouTube) called “Here I Am”, depicting its People’s Liberation Army (PLA) as a benevolent force that upholds justice and peace. The two-minute video combines live footage and animation highlighting the country’s military achievements in UN peacekeeping. While the video’s declarations may seem farfetched to some, it is undoubtedly good publicity. Chinese media and government officials portray these deployments as a positive investment in the country’s promise to support multilateral peace and stability missions. According to Courtney J Fung, China is seen by the UN community and beyond “as a committed peacekeeping state, one that recognises the value of peacekeeping for the UN and for its own discrete foreign policy goals.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-us-peacekeeping-efforts--are-they-enough&quot;&gt;Current US Peacekeeping Efforts – Are They Enough?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its inaugural mission in 1948, the US has consistently been the largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping efforts. Despite maintaining its position as the top funder, the US ranks 84th out of 123 contributing countries regarding the number of peacekeeping personnel deployed. With only 24 peacekeepers participating across seven missions, the US troop and police contributions to UN peacekeeping operations have gradually decreased since 2000 (see Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factors that have contributed to this decline include US military obligations in Afghanistan and Iraq, policy shifts in response to significant geopolitical events, and the domestic political environment. In addition to its financial and troop commitments, the US provides training and equipment to assist partner countries in developing key enabling capabilities to train and sustain peacekeeping proficiencies through efforts such as the US State Department-led Global Peace Operations Initiative and the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership. With a total budget of more than $1.4 billion between fiscal years 2005–2022, these programmes provide a critical funding activity to prevent personnel readiness shortfalls in UN peace operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mPDD5jH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: US Troop and Police Contributions to UN Missions, 2000–2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, at the Leaders’ Summit on Peacekeeping, President Barack Obama committed to expanding support for UN peace missions. He issued new presidential guidance, stating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We’ll work to double the number of US military officers serving in peacekeeping operations. We will offer logistical support, including our unrivaled network of air- and sea-lift. When there’s an urgent need…we’ll undertake engineering projects like building airfields and base camps for new missions. And we’ll step up our efforts to help build the UN’s capacity…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summit was deemed a success, with 31 member states, including the US, committing to contribute over 40,000 troops and police, along with helicopters, engineering and naval units, and field hospitals. However, in the years that followed, the US’s commitment to enhancing UN peacekeeping operations seemed fleeting. Several initiatives have since stalled or been scaled down due to shifting US national security priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent China from dominating UN peacekeeping and achieving its objectives in this mission space, the US should develop and implement several actions now to reassert its leadership role in authorising and shaping peace operations, limit Chinese influence, and demonstrate that it is fully invested in bringing peace, security and stability to challenged regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, the US should support building a bench of qualified military personnel to serve in senior UN billets as proposed in a 2021 Institute for National Strategic Studies report by Bryce Loidolt. Presently, UN headquarters and peace operations deployments are not viewed by the US military services as career-enhancing assignments. However, this attitude may change if senior officers are regularly nominated and selected to serve in key UN peacekeeping staff billets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to filling UN peace mission mid-level general staff positions, the US should actively seek to fill key operational-level leadership positions such as Chief of Staff or Command Group Advisor. This would be an ideal way to make UN officer assignments more attractive within the US military and to demonstrate to all member states that the US has the requisite experience to compete for senior positions within UNDPO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high-impact, low-cost initiative would be to appropriately staff and fund the US Army Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute (PKSOI). The institute serves as the military lead agent for joint advocacy of peace and stability operations. Additionally, PKSOI develops concepts, doctrine and training to ensure the US joint force, interagency and allies/partners have the requisite expertise to plan and execute peacekeeping and stability operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, PKSOI actively participates with the UN on doctrine and concept development, ensuring that US values and peacekeeping norms are upheld. In a 2018 cost-cutting move, the Army decided to decrease PKSOI’s staff and budget dramatically. Restoring PKSOI’s staff and funding to pre-2018 levels (42 billets for $3 million per year) would go a long way in expanding its doctrinal reach inside the UN and signal to the military departments, interagency and the international community that the US values peacekeeping operations and understands that they are a critical conflict management tool, particularly in an era of great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US rarely makes public pronouncements or consistently touts its longstanding support for UN peacekeeping. So, the US government should develop a comprehensive and active engagement plan to communicate all the ways in which it contributes to UN peacekeeping operations. For example, the US Military Observer Group – the Department of Defense’s focal point for military members serving in the UN – does not have a social media presence, and the State Department has few articles announcing its achievements in support of UN peacekeeping. Frequently broadcasting these milestones on US government social media accounts and public-facing webpages would be a low-cost strategic investment that would enable the US to enhance its image and effectively use peacekeeping as a tool to advance its key foreign policy objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, formally published US peacekeeping themes and messages may encourage Combatant Commanders to develop complementary talking points in order to foster better relations and increase US credibility on the issue when they engage in bilateral discussions with major UN peacekeeping troop-contributing countries. The preponderance of these large troop contributors are in the Indo-Pacific and Africa – two strategically important regions to US security interests. Better messaging would assist in emphasising the importance of upholding Western-backed peacekeeping norms – protecting civilians, monitoring and preventing human rights violations, and pursuing governance and security sector reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While increasing US participation and visibility in UN peacekeeping operations offers benefits, it also entail risks. The US possesses substantial military capability and capacity, but these resources are finite and subject to ever-evolving foreign policy priorities. Despite these challenges, the US should capitalise on its contributions to UN peacekeeping by fostering relationships and securing access. This strategic approach would help to counter China’s influence, safeguard national security and advance the US’s foreign policy goals, ultimately enhancing its competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original concept of operations for the Ukrainian offensive was sound. It required 12 armoured and mechanised brigades to achieve a breakthrough along 30 km of frontage, the isolation of Tokmak within seven days, and thereafter a breakout south towards Melitopol. Tempo was supposed to prevent Russia from bringing the majority of its forces to bear, so that the attacking force would need to overcome only six regiments in defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept of operation was not implemented. This arose from operational errors made by both Ukraine and its international partners. Ukraine’s international partners missed two critical decision points prior to the offensive. First, whereas Russia began to transition to a war economy from May 2022 and began the mobilisation of troops from the autumn, Ukraine’s international partners did not take significant steps to address their industrial limitations. In consequence, while many nations gifted Ukraine a significant proportion of their national stocks, this did not amount to a sufficient volume of equipment to provide the doctrinal minimum of critical enablers required for the concept of operation to be executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second decision point missed was when that equipment needed to arrive in Ukraine. Ukraine’s international partners wasted four months in deciding to act, so that only a part of the pledged equipment arrived in Ukraine prior to the offensive, and the Ukrainian brigades did not have enough time to train on the equipment that did arrive. The brigades were, therefore, undertrained at the start of the offensive, which accounts for a significant proportion of the tactical mistakes made during the execution of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine also made a series of errors. First, experienced troops were used to hold the line of contact and thereafter conduct fixing operations during the offensive, while the main force was for the most part newly raised. This left the lead elements with a dearth of combat experience, which led to tactical errors during the execution of the operation. Second, Ukrainian planners exacerbated their shortage of properly equipped forces by committing troops on multiple axes, which were then further resourced with ammunition and enablers, at the expense of the main effort. The combination of these two errors limited the ability of the force to operate at and maintain tempo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most serious error made in planning by Ukraine appears to have been the basis on which it was determined that the main effort could succeed under these circumstances. Rather than using tempo and concentration to defeat six Russian regiments, it was hoped that shock action would cause Russian troops to break, as had occurred around Kharkiv in 2022. Insufficient planning was done to assess how the critical conditions for such a collapse in morale could be achieved, so that this proved an overly optimistic planning assumption. In the event, the initial attacks failed, and tempo was lost, such that Russia could fight the battle with the full 105,000 troops it had in the target sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lesson for both Ukraine and its international partners is that operational security was inadequate, such that Russia knew precisely where and approximately when the offensive was to take place. This problem was exacerbated by the fact that with only a couple of brigades properly equipped for offensive operations, Russia only had to track a small number of units to determine Ukrainian intent. Given that this lack of security partly stemmed from the multinational process of organising the offensive, this should be examined carefully by NATO, which relies on comparable processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a great many tactical lessons identified in this paper. Some, however, raise questions about necessary adaptations to prevailing doctrine. First, there is a need to have an effective counter-reconnaissance capability to reduce sustained enemy observation of the intended axes of advance. The inability to screen axes of advance from enemy ISR risks sustained exposure to precision fires, producing an unacceptable rate of equipment loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second is the need for electronic protection, and a corresponding requirement for electromagnetic command and control. Fratricide in the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) is a major problem for controlling large-scale operations under modern conditions. Given the density of systems dependent on the EMS and the actively contested condition of the spectrum, it is not viable to simply deconflict frequencies at the divisional level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also evident during the offensive that while software-defined systems were critical to the competitiveness of the force, they were also susceptible to targeted electronic warfare interference. This was especially true in relation to precision strike. Over time, the enemy developed hard counters to a range of Ukrainian capabilities including Excalibur and GMLRS (guided multiple-launch rocket systems). It is therefore evident that retaining technological advantage requires the ability to rapidly update systems in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of sustained enemy observation and long-range fires meant that once troops were committed to offensive operations, their ground lines of communication became predictable and targetable, collapsing tempo. Where operations required gap crossing, the issue of sustainment became insurmountable. The question of how enduring protection of crossing points to sustain a force across a wet gap can be established should be a critical area of capability focus for NATO forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the density of precision effects, even at tactical echelons, has left prestige enablers, such as offensive breaching vehicles, exceedingly vulnerable. Without such assets, there is no mobility, and thus no scope for manoeuvre. NATO militaries should therefore carefully examine how the density of enablers can be increased without overburdening the force, or how enabling capabilities can augment other platforms, such as to improve the organic mobility of units. Dependence on small fleets of specialist enablers is increasingly non-viable when the enemy can discern and engage specific targets within a formation and will do so throughout the depth of an operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ukraine, the lead times involved in regenerating offensive combat power mean that renewed offensive operations are not viable in the foreseeable future. To that end, Ukraine must now reprioritise inflicting as much damage as possible on the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation to buy the necessary time. At the same time, Ukraine is likely to pursue trying to constrain Russian revenue generation through strikes on Russian revenue-generating infrastructure. Time can be bought, albeit at a heavy price. The question for Ukraine and its international partners is what is done with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Ukraine launched an offensive operation in an attempt to break through Russian defence lines and sever the land corridor occupied by Russia at the neck of Crimea. The operation failed to achieve any of its objectives. Understanding why is vital to ensuring that future Ukrainian operations are properly planned and resourced, and to inform the way in which NATO land forces endeavour to rebuild their offensive combat power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several reports on the Ukrainian offensive of 2023, including some contributions by the authors, emphasise tactical considerations in explaining its failure. This report does address tactical lessons, but it is primarily concerned with the operational shortcomings of the offensive, relating to planning, operational decisions, the absolute shortage of critical means, and the challenges of mobilisation, force generation and logistics. The report seeks to shed light on how much decision space the Ukrainian military had, and where decision points actually lay. For example, problems with the concentration of a critical mass of Ukrainian troops on the main effort, and with Ukrainian force quality at the beginning of the offensive, have been widely reported. This does explain why particular assaults failed. However, the factors leading to these limitations were the result of decisions made months earlier, and so correcting such vulnerabilities has a long lead time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report was written in collaboration with the Ukrainian General Staff. The report is based on interviews with Ukrainian military personnel and commanders at tactical, operational and strategic echelons throughout 2023. It also draws on the operational data accumulated by the Ukrainian General Staff on troop strengths, casualties and equipment levels in units. The authors also worked closely with the lessons learned department of the Ukrainian General Staff, responsible for identifying adaptations to training, tactics and organisation for the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). In addition, the authors engaged extensively with Ukraine’s international partners throughout the offensive. While observations from those interviews shaped the thinking in this report, no data from Ukraine’s international partners is used. The report builds on and extends a report written by the authors covering the first six months of the war, published in November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has a range of methodological limitations that should be declared up front. This is not an impartial piece of analysis. Ukraine is fighting an ongoing war, meaning there are parts of the dataset examined that cannot be released. There are also topics – such as some of the details of the relationship between Ukraine and some of its international partners – that remain sensitive and cannot be addressed. This report also – while identifying a range of shortcomings in decision-making, planning and tactical execution – avoids allocating blame. The authors aim for lessons to be learned, rather than seeking to offer an exercise in accountability. It should also be noted that the data in this report is derived from figures declassified for release in Ukrainian General Staff assessments. Other assessments have been made at various times, which often cite different numbers. In some instances, these may be more precise; in others, they are less so. However, there are very few alternative open source datasets that are persistently available using a consistent methodology across the period under examination. Some of the more complete datasets in the public domain are either Ukrainian or Russian information operations. This report therefore generally uses the Ukrainian General Staff figures because the consistency in methodology allows for like-for-like comparisons over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very briefly, it is worth noting one topic that is conspicuous by its absence: airpower. Much has been written about the importance of airpower in NATO offensive operations. The reality, however, is that while Ukraine’s lack of airpower was undoubtedly a serious disadvantage, it would not have been possible to build Ukrainian airpower capabilities in a manner where Ukraine would have been capable of conducting effective close air support inside the threat envelope that prevailed and within the timeframe of the Ukrainian 2023 offensive being planned and executed. Airpower was used during the offensive, with the Russians launching dozens of glide bombs per day onto Ukrainian positions. But in this it was used more as an augmentation of artillery, rather than as a parallel campaign. It therefore affords limited data points to discuss the application of airpower. As such a discussion would be somewhat theoretical, it has been omitted from this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report is divided into four chapters. Chapter I describes the command decisions that shaped Ukrainian operations from September 2022 to the commencement of the offensive in June 2023. It establishes a baseline context and explains the correlation of forces. Chapter II describes the phases of the Ukrainian offensive, concluding in October 2023. Chapter III analyses the factors that contributed to Ukraine’s failure during the summer offensive, which are specific to this conflict. Chapter IV examines tactical and operational challenges that were new and are not accounted for in existing doctrine among Ukraine’s international partners, which are relevant for the regeneration of offensive combat power in NATO countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-the-operational-context&quot;&gt;I. The Operational Context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, the AFU halted the advance of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (AFRF) in Donbas. There were three factors that caused the Russian offensive to culminate. Russia had suffered heavy attrition among its best units during the early phase of the conflict – which were, in any case, inappropriately organised for large-scale offensive operations – and was thus finding it difficult to sustain offensive momentum. The AFRF had been compensating for this shortcoming through the application of an overwhelming fires advantage. Ukraine’s use of long-range precision strikes destroying Russian logistical infrastructure in June and July 2022 denied Russian forces this advantage. After months of bruising defensive operations, this created the first opportunity for Ukraine to seize the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ukraine’s political leadership, uncertainty as to the longevity of international support was the critical factor in planning. Ultimately, Ukraine could be defeated in two ways: the AFU could be broken on the battlefield, or the loss of international support could leave it without arms or ammunition. By summer 2022, Ukraine had exhausted its own stocks of most critical munition natures and therefore depended on the international community. It was also believed that the flurry of gifting of equipment would not last unless Ukraine’s international partners perceived a viable path towards favourable war termination. Thus, the political direction to the AFU was twofold. First, the AFU had to generate a plan for offensive operations that could be sold to Ukraine’s international partners, who would need to resource it. Second, successful offensive operations of symbolic significance had to take place imminently. A further drive towards an early offensive was the threat that Russia would annex, depopulate and thereafter entrench the boundaries of the occupied territories. Russian officials had openly discussed annexation prior to the invasion, as well as during its early stages, and it would mirror the Russian playbook in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of the AFU’s combat power in August 2022 was fixed defending the line of contact. Many units had been attrited, and so there was a relatively small number of brigades that had a sufficient level of readiness as a reserve to be used in offensive operations. With political direction to undertake offensive operations, the General Staff had to determine against which axes these forces would be committed. In terms of impact on the war if successful, the most attractive plan was to push south from Zaporizhzhia towards Melitopol and thereby sever the neck of Crimea, while simultaneously cutting the supply lines to Russian forces holding the right bank of the Dnipro River around Kherson. This axis was high risk. The consequence of the thrust would be a long and thin penetration with Russian forces on both sides. If the Russians responded aggressively this thrust could fail. The thrust would be close to the main concentrations of Russian forces in Ukraine at the time, who had been moved to the area to deny this very axis. Many of the Russian troops there had also not participated in the offensive in Donbas and had suffered fewer losses of equipment or personnel. The decision was therefore made to commit several brigades to attack the Russian forces on the right bank of the Dnipro to liberate Kherson, since the river would protect Ukrainian forces from any Russian attempt to counterattack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operation to liberate Kherson began on 29 August 2022. The fight would prove challenging. The Russians had committed some of their best troops to the city. The fact that the Ukrainian political leadership needed to demonstrate a “win” to Western partners meant that the objective of the operation had been heavily signalled. The Russians knew what was coming and had prepared three defence lines around the city. Despite the rate of resupply for Russian forces being constrained by the need to move materiel across contested crossing points over the Dnipro, Ukrainian forces found themselves advancing into well-sited ATGM (anti-tank guided missile) ambushes and artillery killing areas. The Russians used the limited artillery support they had in the region effectively. The AFU made some initial gains, only for their tempo to diminish as equipment and personnel losses mounted. Nevertheless, Russian troops were in a vulnerable position and, given Ukrainian fire control over their supply lines, risked slowly losing many competent troops. This pressure on Russian supply lines eventually saw Moscow withdraw its forces from Kherson in an orderly manner in October and November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broader operational challenge faced by Russian forces in summer 2022 was that the initial invasion force was too small to maintain a sufficient concentration of troops across the breadth of the front. As the Kherson operation drew in Russian reserves, the question therefore arose as to whether the AFU could apply pressure elsewhere on the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best place to attack was assessed to be in Kharkiv Oblast, which had several attractions. First, the Russian army lacked forces there, with units having suffered heavily during Russia’s offensive in Donbas. Second, as things stood, Izium remained a launching point for further attacks on Donbas, while the Russians were in artillery range of Kharkiv’s suburbs. This latter point, given Kharkiv’s significance as a major population centre, made Kharkiv a priority axis. While Russian forces observed Ukraine’s build-up of troops on the Kharkiv axis, they lacked forces to respond, having committed them to the south. It is also reasonable to conclude that while Ukraine did not achieve surprise as regards their intentions, they did achieve surprise with the timing of the attack. The gains exceeded Ukrainian expectations, as the Russian Western Group of Forces collapsed. Ironically, although the liberation of Kherson had been prioritised because it was a notable objective, the unexpected speed and scale of the gains in Kharkiv had an outsized effect in convincing Ukraine’s international partners that resourcing offensive operations could bring about results, thereby achieving the political goals of the operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autumn 2022 was marked by notable successes on the part of the AFU. Nevertheless, the AFU entered 2023 facing several significant challenges. Over the course of 2022, the AFU had taken approximately 30,000 killed and missing, and a significant number of wounded. Most losses took place during the Russian offensive on Donbas in May and June 2022, and during the offensive to liberate Kherson. Many of these losses were concentrated among Ukraine’s professional military brigades, which had been on the frontline continuously since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Besides killed and wounded, the AFU had also lost a large quantity of materiel. New units could be mobilised, but without equipment for them they could not be made suitable for offensive operations. The Territorial Defence Forces were left largely unmechanised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge was available commands. Although the AFU had capable brigade staffs, these were largely committed to managing defensive sectors. The expansion of the AFU after the invasion increased the number of troops, but there was not a proportional number of experienced brigade staffs so that brigades tended to be given more battalions under command. The limited number of brigade enablers made it difficult to rotate full brigades off the line of contact so that they could conduct exercises to prepare for brigade operations. The challenge of rotation was exacerbated by the risks involved, due to the congestion it caused on the roads. Given the persistent threat to Ukraine’s training areas from Russian long-range strikes, and the lack of ammunition, spares or platforms to equip new units, Ukraine could raise new units, but training and equipping them depended on support from the country’s partners. If the AFU was to conduct further successful offensive operations, it needed to build new brigades, appropriately equipped for the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main outlines of a plan for a major offensive were in place by September 2022. The successes of the Kherson and Kharkiv offensives created the political belief that liberating further territories held by Russia could be possible. This spurred the Ramstein process – in which Ukraine’s international partners pledged the provision of materiel and other support – to begin cohering donations of equipment from Ukraine’s allies. Unfortunately, the process of agreeing what equipment could be gifted took almost three months, with pledges only made in January 2023. This wasted time would come at a terrible price later in the year. The process also established a clear tension between the need to sell the plan and the requirements of operational security. Regrettably, both Ukrainian messaging and speculation by Western officials were already setting clear expectations of a Ukrainian spring offensive and its potential objectives as early as December 2022. These discussions were noted in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to Ukraine’s offensive operations, the AFRF adopted several measures to stabilise their front that would fundamentally alter the context for the future Ukrainian offensive. First, the AFRF had declared mobilisation to raise troop levels after the Ukrainian breakthrough in Kharkiv exposed how Russian forces were stretched. Second, the AFRF withdrew from the right bank of the Dnipro through Kherson, turning the river into a natural defensive barrier and securing their flank. Third, the Russians set about building deliberate defences across the approaches to the neck of Crimea in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Mobilisation did not rapidly produce well-trained soldiers. The defence lines would also take time to erect. Russia therefore embarked on an offensive in late January 2023, beginning in Vuhledar but rapidly spreading to most of the eastern front, with a particular emphasis on the city of Bakhmut. This ill-prepared offensive using under-trained troops was extremely costly for the Russians, but the command appears to have judged that it could trade lives for time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian mobilisation placed the AFU in a challenging position, where tactical successes could increasingly expose Ukraine to operational vulnerability over time. There has been a protracted debate about the efforts expended by the AFU in the defence of Bakhmut. Once depopulated by shelling, the city itself was of little value. However, the concern within the Ukrainian General Staff was that if Bakhmut fell without the AFRF culminating there, their next objective would be Chasiv Yar. Chasiv Yar not only straddles a ridge that would have facilitated further offensive operations, but if captured would also bring the rail and ground lines of communication from Kostyantynivka under Russian fire control and could bring Kramatorsk within range of Russian artillery, risking its depopulation. Furthermore, if the Russians did not culminate in Bakhmut they would force the AFU to fight for vital ground at a time when the intent was to be committing resources to offensive operations elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Russia’s assault on the city offered the prospect of an urban defence where the AFU could inflict disproportionate losses, the decision was made to mount a determined defence of the city. Initially, this decision was vindicated by high Russian losses. However, Bakhmut was a highly unfavourable position to defend, situated in low ground. Russian gains around Bakhmut meant that by February the AFRF had established artillery control over the main ground lines of communication into the city along which Ukrainian troops were rotated. At this point, the disparity in losses became unfavourable for Ukraine. Overall, approximately 10,000 Ukrainian troops were killed or severely wounded during the fight for and around Bakhmut. Russian forces attacking the city were largely composed of Wagner Group troops and mobilised convicts, with support from the VDV (Russian Airborne Forces). In total, 19,547 Wagner fighters were killed in Bakhmut, with a similar number seriously wounded. In theory, this produced a 4:1 exchange ratio in favour of Ukraine. However, 88% of Wagner losses were of mobilised convicts, with the number of trained Wagner troops killed averaging between 40 and 60 per week. Thus, while Ukraine was losing experienced personnel, Russia was expending what it considered disposable untrained troops to fix the AFU, while inflicting heavy losses with its 5:1 advantage in artillery. Militarily, it is evident that the optimal tactical course of action would have been to withdraw to a new defence line once the AFRF had artillery control of the ground lines of communication into the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politically, however, the Ukrainian government believed that withdrawing from Bakhmut came with considerable risk. The decision point for the withdrawal coincided with several key decisions on the release of critical equipment, including tanks, munitions and enablers to Ukraine, mainly from Germany, for the planned offensive. The idea of the news from the front being Russia’s success against its main objective was, therefore, judged to endanger the speed with which Ukraine’s international partners would push materiel forward. Thus, the city was allowed to acquire a strategic symbolic significance that defied operational military logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By February 2023, the scale of a Ukrainian offensive had been determined, based on the volume of equipment being supplied by Ukraine’s partners and the troops that had been raised to conduct it. Ukraine and its partners thereafter set about apportioning equipment and training to these units. The challenge that emerged from the fight for Bakhmut was that many of those lost were experienced troops who could have been seeded throughout new units to raise their tactical proficiency. Instead, while experienced forces held the Russians back, new units were prepared for the offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By March 2023, equipment deliveries were starting to arrive in Ukraine. Given the limitations of available equipment in NATO countries that had run down their own militaries for three decades, the donations of equipment represented a large proportion of national stocks. It is important here to reflect on the scale of the conflict, as it highlights the extent to which many of Ukraine’s international partners have come to depend on fleets of military equipment that are manifestly too small for the purpose for which the equipment was procured. Relative to Russian forces, the quantity of equipment provided to Ukraine has been small. The total number of tanks given to Ukraine as aid over the course of the war is 671. Only 150 of these are Western models, with the majority Soviet models. At the same time, Ukraine has captured 495 Russian tanks over the course of the war, which makes Russia its largest single supplier of tanks. Ukraine received 480 infantry fighting vehicles from its international partners, more than 300 of which were BMP-1s. Ukraine has also captured 424 Russian BMPs. And yet, Russian equipment levels in theatre have expanded over the course of the fighting, with Russia producing and refurbishing approximately 1,500 tanks per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be argued that there was and to some extent is a significant cognitive dissonance between what Ukraine’s international partners gave to Ukraine and what they thought could be achieved. In essence, while what was gifted was a significant proportion of the national stocks of Ukraine’s partners, that did not make the volume of equipment commensurate with the task. The inability of Western officials to grasp the scale of the fighting sat behind a persistent misalignment of expectations and outcome that haunted the 2023 Ukrainian offensive. This hype was exacerbated by Ukrainian information operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commitment of experienced troops to blunt the Russian winter–spring offensive meant that the new units raised for the Ukrainian offensive were predominantly made up of fresh recruits. This was identified by commanders of these units in after-action reviews as a mistake, as it left an insufficient proportion of the force with combat experience during early engagements. These troops received basic training in the UK and Europe, and some subsequently received collective training. Other personnel received specialist training in operating donated equipment. This proved problematic. First, Ukraine received a vast range of equipment, and even within the same platform type it received multiple varieties. The result was that each formed Ukrainian brigade was fielding up to five different armoured vehicles. Moreover, while equipment that was to be donated had to be brought out of storage and either repaired or demodernised to remove sensitive systems, the equipment that many Ukrainian specialists trained on came from active military units in the donor nation. This meant that the vehicles on which Ukrainian troops trained differed in the workflow, capabilities and maintenance requirements from those that arrived in Ukraine, usually without manuals or spares. The result was that the units prepared for the offensive lacked combat experience among their junior leaders, had received accelerated tactical training on equipment that differed from the weapons with which they were to fight, and had a limited ability to maintain and operate the few platforms they received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More time was needed to build up the readiness of the brigades created for Ukraine’s offensive. However, time was also unavailable, as it would give Russia the opportunity to extend and deepen its defence lines and to raise and train more forces. With Russia’s force expansion proceeding faster than Ukraine’s, there was a point after which no offensive could have been possible. The key lesson for NATO leaders is that the preference of politicians to defer decisions is extremely costly in war. Just as Russia paid a heavy price for not mobilising in April 2022, Ukraine suffered for not expanding mobilisation, backed by an earlier commitment from its partners to train and equip its forces at scale, made in September 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In planning for the offensive, the Ukrainian General Staff had assessed five options for the axes of advance. First, there was the eastern direction around Bakhmut. This axis offered the greatest freedom of manoeuvre, but there were no objectives in this direction that would alter the logic of the conflict, unless Ukraine could surround or isolate a large body of Russian troops. This was deemed unlikely. All other options would aim to bring the neck of Crimea under physical control or fire control, complementing the roll back of the Black Sea Fleet to bring about the isolation of Crimea, thereby altering the dynamics of the war. The second axis would see amphibious operations across the Dnipro River. This would bypass much of the Russian defence line, but Ukrainian troops would face the same challenge of contested supply lines as had undermined the Russian defence of Kherson. There were three axes heading south. The westernmost axis would strike along a ridge line, parallel to the Dnipro, through Vasilyivka. This had some attractions. It would bypass the densest parts of Russia’s defence line, while a large stretch of the axis had been the basis for exercises in Ukrainian professional military education, such that many officers were familiar with the ground. There were drawbacks. First, it would involve two river crossings in the initial phases. Second, it would leave Ukrainian forces advancing on a narrow front, with the risk of being pinned against the Dnipro. Third, this axis would have brought fighting close to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant at Energodar, with the risk that it could be damaged or sabotaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final two axes ran from Orikhiv via Tokmak towards Melitopol, and through Velika Novosilka towards Berdyansk. The density of Russian defences was comparable on these axes, with a slightly greater concentration on the former. The latter, however, required much more ground to be covered to be successful. Considering all these factors, the Orikhiv–Tokmak axis was identified as the direction of the Ukrainian main effort. Fixing actions, meanwhile, would be undertaken towards Bakhmut and threatened across the Dnipro to reduce Russia’s lateral redeployment of forces to defend Tokmak. The subsequent blowing of the Nova Kakhovka dam by the AFRF during the first week of the offensive removed the possibility of a fixing operation being executed across the Dnipro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AFRF was aware of the Ukrainian plan in detail. Between Ukrainian messaging, the leaking of highly classified information from the US, and terrain analysis, the Russians had concentrated their defences on the Orikhiv–Tokmak axis. Thus, by the time the offensive was to be executed, the correlation of forces was unfavourable to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The offensive plan envisaged Ukraine fielding 12 brigades. As originally conceived, three brigades were to support a fixing operation against Russian forces in the east. Three armoured brigades would then be committed to breach the Russian defence line, with another three mechanised brigades echeloning through to defeat Russian forces defending Tokmak. The final three brigades were to function as an exploitation force. In principle, the breach was to be accomplished within seven days. Such a tempo would mean that the Ukrainian forces would need to defeat six AFRF regiments, producing a favourable local force ratio. In practice, the original plan could not be executed at the time when the offensive was launched because of the equipment and readiness of the brigades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brigades for the offensive comprised three brigades of the National Guard of Ukraine (the 3rd, 14th and 15th Brigades) and three tactical groups of the AFU. The latter were called corps (the 9th Corps, the 10th Corps and the “Maroon” Corps), even though they were definitely not corps, by neither NATO nor Ukrainian standards, lacking corps echelon troops or the cohesion to function as formations. At best, they were division-sized units without divisional or adequate numbers of brigade enablers. Rather than being full armoured and mechanised brigades, the tactical groups consisted of two to three mechanised battalions each, with additional unmechanised units. The subordinate brigades fielded few critical enablers. The original scheme of manoeuvre had been for 9th Corps to be responsible for the initial break-in through the Russian disruption belt, for 10th Corps to penetrate to Tokmak, and for the Maroon Corps to then exploit towards Melitopol. Because these brigades lacked the equipment or readiness to execute a plan at the requisite tempo, the Russians would have time to bring to bear their forces throughout the area of the operation, which shifted the correlation of forces to unfavourable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In front of the Ukrainian forces were arrayed three defence lines comprising a disruption belt and forward defence line, a main defence line, and a reserve defence line, collectively straddling about 30 km of depth. These were defended by the 7th Airborne Division and the 42nd Motorised Rifle Division of the AFRF. For every 10 km of defence, the Russians thus had one motorised rifle regiment (70, 71 and 291 Regiments across the frontage of the axis) and one airborne regiment. In the second line were the 56th, 108th and 247 th Regiments. The 810th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Russian Federation and one of the battalions of the 177th Naval Infantry Regiment were also deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, two motorised rifle divisions (19 and 42) and two airborne divisions (7 and 76, consisting of the 104, 234 and 347 Regiments) were available to be brought to the defence lines, under command of the 58th Combined Arms Army. Additional artillery units were also assigned, including the 439th Artillery Brigade, equipped with Tornado-S MLRS (multiple-launch rocket systems). At the beginning of the Ukrainian offensive, the Russians had cached 35 days’ worth of supplies of ammunition around their gun lines, amounting to three replenishments of a standard load per day. In addition, the Russians fielded about 60 combat helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that while the AFRF had reverted back to the divisional and regimental force structure from the battalion tactical group in 2022, the composition of its units at this time was somewhat irregular. Many battalions included Storm-Z companies, territorial units and other attachments, while also lacking some of the conventional elements of their order of battle. The unit designations above should not, therefore, be taken as proxies for the order of battle, but rather as the command and control (C2) elements of the Russian defensive echelons. In total, if the Ukrainian offensive had prosecuted its three phases, there were 105,000 Russian troops that were available to defend the Orikhiv–Tokmak–Melitopol axis. These troops fielded approximately 470 tanks, up to 1,410 armoured fighting vehicles, over 720 artillery systems, up to 230 MLRS, and 12 operational–tactical missile complexes. However, if the tempo envisaged in the original plan had been achieved, Ukrainian forces would only have had to contend with 30% of these forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lacking the units of action to execute the plan as originally intended, Ukrainian planners nevertheless felt that an offensive had to be attempted, and so began to hypothesise that if the initial attack applied enough pressure, they could advance into a numerically superior enemy by breaking its morale. The defeat mechanism of the Russian defence lines was premised on deep strike and shock action causing localised collapse. It was hoped that this would thereafter lead to a manoeuvre defence that would see Russian troops lose cohesion. These were very optimistic assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Ukraine fielded approximately 400,000 combat troops including the Territorial Defence Forces, the National Guard and State Border Guards at this time, there has been much discussion as to why more troops were not concentrated for the attack. First, many of these troops were not equipped or trained for breaching operations. But it is also important to note the broader context of the conflict to appreciate the risks that further concentration would have created elsewhere. Unlike in September 2022, when the Russian concentration in the south came at the expense of other parts of the line, mobilisation had allowed the AFRF to maintain significant forces across the front and to replenish losses. Thus, despite the losses suffered by Russia in early 2023, in July the number of Russian troops fielded in the Operational Group of Forces attacking Ukraine increased to about 450,000 personnel, fielding 2,200 tanks and 5,150 armoured combat vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-the-ukrainian-offensive-of-2023&quot;&gt;II. The Ukrainian Offensive of 2023&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-May, Ukraine initiated operations on the Bakhmut axis, intended to fix Russian forces ahead of the main effort in the south. The attack on the Orikhiv–Tokmak axis was opened on 3 June, with operations by supporting brigades to secure the flanks of the main axis. The intent was for artillery preparation and an assault to take place during the night of 3–4 June. During these opening phases, however, several tactical errors were made. First, deconfliction between the troops assigned to the main effort and those that had been holding the front prior to the offensive was inadequate. This led to several incidents of friendly fire and disruption caused by Ukrainian defensive obstacles, prior to the initiation of attacks. Second, this disruption led to a time lag between the initial fire preparation missions and the assault of approximately three hours, leading to the opening of the main effort commencing after dawn. These errors reflected the limited cohesion carried out at brigade level during training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battalions of the 47th, 65th, and 33rd Brigades from 9th Corps opened the offensive with a series of attempted breaches by mechanised companies. MICLIC and UR-77 Meteorit explosive breaching lines were used to create lanes in the minefields, but these were often of insufficient depth to deliver a complete breach, while inexperienced vehicle crews deviated from the cleared path. A lack of demining equipment then became a problem. The corps had 10 demining vehicles, mainly Vincent-1s. These could clear ground but would overheat and shut down after ploughing for a sustained period. Russian units concentrated ATGMs, fired from infantry positions and from tanks stationed on high ground, against the demining equipment. Furthermore, a shortage of mine ploughs meant that usually only the leading vehicle had clearing equipment in each breach. The Ukrainian artillery also lacked smoke rounds to obscure their lines of advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result was that multiple company attacks suffered the same fate. They entered the narrow breaching lanes, only for the lead vehicle to be knocked out or immobilised. At this point, the cleared lane was too narrow for vehicles to turn, so that, when following vehicles, if either tried to turn around or to move around the destroyed leading vehicle, they would become immobilised by mines. This led to large concentrated groupings of immobilised Ukrainian armour, which would then be targeted by Russian artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the blunting of initial armoured advances, the first Russian defensive positions were lightly held. Following the initial failed assaults, Ukrainian forces made a series of dismounted attacks drawing on troops from more experienced units, which managed to enter the first series of Russian fighting positions. Consistent with Russian doctrine, the first belt of defensive positions was a disruption zone, and thus Russian forces withdrew from some of their positions before Ukrainian troops entered them during the first two weeks of the offensive, only to counterattack before the enemy could consolidate. This was not conducted in an orderly manner, and so Russian forces took losses to Ukrainian artillery. There were two drivers of this disorder. First, Russian guns lacked the range to conduct effective counterbattery fire. Second, weeks of Ukrainian propaganda had convinced some Russian soldiers that they were about to face the brunt of NATO’s heavy equipment, and morale among some troops was low, although this phenomenon was uneven. Nevertheless, as the mechanised Ukrainian units began to accumulate losses and videos of these engagements spread among Russian troops, their confidence started to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losses during the initial assaults had an impact on the morale of as yet uncommitted Ukrainian units. The Ukrainian troops’ confidence in both their equipment and training diminished, especially since the second echelon was largely mounted in BMPs that lacked the crew survivability offered by Western infantry fighting vehicles. As a result, Ukrainian commanders moved experienced troops from a range of unmechanised supporting brigades into the line to conduct assaults using dismounted assault group tactics. Because these units had not been prioritised for the provision of Western equipment, many of them lacked means to support their assaults. This led to the blending of units, with tanks or breaching equipment borrowed from one brigade to support the assault groups of another. The result was that in some instances a company attack might have supporting components from up to three brigades enabling the effort. This proved highly problematic. The Ukrainian brigades that were prepared for the offensive also had not previously practised working with the brigades protecting their flanks. For those troops lacking combat experience, with very short training courses in the West, control of direct fire was a serious problem, such that there were many cases of friendly fire between intermingled sub-units from different brigades. Despite these complications, the assault units did make some progress into the Russian defence lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukrainian forces got deeper into the defences, new challenges started to emerge. First, by late June, Russian troops started to counterattack. At first, this involved the use of their artillery, held out of range of the front, to destroy abandoned fighting positions once they were occupied by Ukrainian troops. Second, Russian troops began to use dismounted infantry supported by armour to attack the positions at night. Given that each Ukrainian battalion produces at best two platoons of fully capable assault troops, it was vital that Ukrainian forces replaced assault troops with line infantry on positions they occupied. In general, there were insufficient troops to conduct rotations. The tempo of Russian counterattacks also meant that troops would then need to be resupplied. Resupply at night through the narrow breaches in the minefields was extremely dangerous, especially given the limited availability of night vision equipment, and Russia’s use of artillery-deployed scatterable mines. Thus, Ukrainian units often had to resupply during the day, when Russian troops would begin to attack the resupply routes using FPV loitering munitions and barrel-launched ATGMs fired by tanks from hilltops, and attack aviation firing ATAKA and Vikhr ATGMs. Given the absolute shortage of demining equipment, this often had to be accomplished by hand, which was slow and dangerous. The overall effect was to prevent any build-up of tempo, such that Ukrainian units had to continually attack prepared positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loss of enablers in 9th Corps meant that this equipment had to be committed from 10th Corps to continue the attacks. Without these enablers, and without the C2 to conduct a large-scale forward passage of lines in a convoluted battlespace, 10th Corps began to be committed piecemeal, not only on the main axis, but also on the eastern axis around Bakhmut, and on the supporting Velika Novosilka axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Ukrainian troops managed to gain sufficient lodgements to push further into the defences in some sectors. These were, however, highly predictable for the Russians, so defensive means could be concentrated at these points. Moreover, because of the narrow width of the proposed axis of advance and the persistent threat from Lancet-3Ms hunting Ukrainian artillery, the guns could not be brought forwards. This meant that proportionally more Russian artillery could cover Ukrainian lines of advance without Ukrainian counterbattery fire being able to reach the Russian guns. Thus, for the second round of assaults, the resistance became harder. With most of the available demining equipment already lost, the proportion of breaching that needed to be conducted by hand increased. The units conducting it largely lacked dismounted breaching equipment. This time, Russian troops consistently held their positions, having often set up flanking ambushes from the tree lines while counterattacking aggressively with armour. During this phase, Ukrainian troops often took positions, only to lose them to counterattacks, such that assaults would need to be repeated several times. As a result, by late June, Ukrainian officers feared that the counteroffensive would not achieve its aims and paused while they debated where and how to commit additional units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original plan had seen the 9th, 10th and Maroon Corps as distinct units of action. In practice, units of the 9th Corps had been expended in the first assaults, while 10th Corps had been committed piecemeal, exacerbated by the need to amalgamate breaching equipment. By July, Ukrainian commanders had to judge whether to commit units from the Maroon Corps to continuing the southern axis, or to call off the offensive. Politically, halting the offensive seemed unacceptable. Fears that there would not be another chance and hopes that the Russian resistance would falter if the attack were sustained led to the decision to continue pushing south, but with the revised objective of capturing Tokmak. The AFU, recognising that to use its exploitation force for the assault would prevent an exploitation after the breakthrough, also switched its prioritisation of fires towards a damage-centric strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s long-range strike campaign during the offensive deserves some discussion. More than 300 Storm Shadow and SCALP cruise missiles were delivered to Ukraine over the course of the offensive, although only small numbers could be launched at any given time. Despite some strikes on Russian C2 and logistics during the offensive, long-range fires had little impact on the fighting. Given the extent to which NATO militaries hope that precision and deep strike can offset volume of unguided artillery, it is worth examining the reason for these results. First, the priority of the precision strike campaign was to destroy the Russian Black Sea Fleet and to degrade defences on the Crimean Peninsula. Combined with the use of uncrewed surface vessels, long-range precision strikes degraded Russian sea control. This had the strategic effect of allowing Ukraine to resume exports from its ports. It also set the conditions for the isolation of Crimea from the sea, although this effect would only be felt if the neck of Crimea could be threatened. The long-range strike campaign was therefore successful against its primary objective, but the failure of the ground operation meant the success was not fully exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strikes using Storm Shadow in support of the ground operation proved less successful. Several headquarters were destroyed, including the reserve command post of the 58th Combined Arms Army in Berdyansk, along with strikes on bridges at the neck of Crimea. Collectively, however, these strikes never reached the critical level of damage that would disorder the C2 or logistics system. Nor were the strikes themselves effectively synchronised with ground operations that would have caused pressure in tempo with disruption in the deep. This was partly because having effect in the land domain requires the simultaneous servicing of more targets than operations targeting naval forces. The damage to the Black Sea Fleet was absolute. Damaged command posts and bridges, by contrast, could be replaced and repaired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the offensive, GMLRS strikes had been prioritised in maximum depth, to disrupt Russian C2 and logistics and also to target air defence systems and other targets that could have improved the efficiency of loitering munitions raids on Crimea. Once the objective became more limited to Tokmak, the depth of the fires campaign also came back, with an emphasis on fires in shallow depth to assist with the attack. Thus, GMLRS in particular started to be reprioritised, from targeting high-value targets to striking Russian artillery. This was also driven by the inability to push Ukrainian guns forwards, as the breach was insufficiently wide, and scoured by Lancets. While many Russian guns were destroyed, with only approximately seven GMLRs (munitions, not launchers) per day to service the whole theatre, the rate of destruction was something Russian troops could absorb during the critical period when Ukraine had remaining offensive combat power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of precision strike was further mitigated by Russian countermeasures. The munitions that were to deliver these precision effects had been employed for almost a year by the time the offensive began. Whereas Excalibur, for example, was achieving around 70% effectiveness at the beginning of the conflict, by August 2023, it was hitting the designated point only 6% of the time, a rate lower than non-precision munitions. This was because of exquisite electronic warfare (EW) countermeasures fielded by the AFRF. The impact on GMLRS was slightly different. The first challenge was that electronic protection systems were able to redirect entire salvos of GMLRS targeting specific areas. The second issue was that Russian air defences had been calibrated to be able to shoot down GMLRS. These problems could be overcome by layering effects. The use of other munition types such as HARMs, EW or decoys, or selecting the right time to engage, made GMLRS strikes highly effective. But these shaping requirements significantly reduced the tempo and scale at which strikes could be directed against operationally significant targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commitment of Maroon Corps units in July began to exert significant pressure on the 58th Combined Arms Army. Along with small numbers of strikes in depth using Storm Shadow, the attrition of artillery systems with GMLRS, and the fact that Russian troops had been in the line for two months of heavy fighting, Ukrainian units began to achieve results in small tactical actions, largely by narrowing the axis on which they were working from a 30 km frontage to a 10 km frontage. In one incident, for example, a Ukrainian assault group of 15 personnel managed to dislodge 88 Russian troops from a position. Despite these kinds of incidents, the pace of advance was extremely slow and always gave the Russians time to reset their defences, such that every attack had to be a deliberate assault action. The need to secure the flanks of any gains further slowed progress. Furthermore, Ukrainian advances began to be canalised between two pieces of high ground across an area 7 km wide. This left troops vulnerable to plunging fire from the flanks, further constraining the rate of advance. The commitment of the Maroon Corps, as the exploitation force, also removed any risk for the Russians that further Ukrainian axes could be prioritised. This freed up Russian troops to rotate the more damaged units of the 58th Combined Arms Army, such that Ukrainian forces found themselves fighting fresh troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been persistent discussion about the Ukrainian decision to commit some of the troops prepared for the offensive towards the Bakhmut axis, rather than concentrating forces in the south. This is, to some extent, the wrong framing of the choice facing the AFU. The allocation of ammunition to the eastern axis certainly contributed to Ukraine having insufficient fires on the southern axis. Nevertheless, since Ukrainian artillery was being held back from advancing by Russian mines and Lancets, adding more artillery pieces to the southern axis would not have axiomatically increased Ukraine’s firepower where it mattered. The same can be said of committing more troops. Given the frontages involved, pushing more companies of assault troops southwards would not have vastly increased the scale of operations that could be carried out and thus the combat power applied. As it became clear, however, that the southern axis might at best reach Tokmak – and even this objective appeared in doubt – there was a strong political direction to demonstrate progress, so that more troops were committed to the Bakhmut axis. Without sufficient mechanised forces, however, these attacks could not achieve sufficient tempo to produce encirclements of Russian troops. The eastern direction therefore devolved into fights for treelines. The real trade-off decision, therefore, was not between the commitment of units between two axes or one, but rather whether these reserves should have been committed at all, or else preserved. In hindsight, the commitment of these forces appears to have been a mistake, as Ukraine is now short of cohered units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian attrition during the offensive arguably reached its height in early August. The use of counterattacks, and the provision of dual-purpose improved conventional munitions (DPICM) to Ukraine, which increased both the number of rounds that could be fired per day and the lethality of these fire missions, all drove up Russian casualties. Nevertheless, Russia continued to rotate its regiments under its divisions to ensure that there were fresh troops holding the defences. If a breakthrough to Tokmak was going to happen, this was most likely in early August. After that, the likelihood began to diminish. Ukrainian ammunition stocks meant that the rate of fire to support offensive operations could be continued until October at the latest. By mid-September, offensive actions were largely aimed at improving tactical positions, as commanders recognised that a breakthrough – even to Tokmak – was not going to occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The offensive may have culminated, but one last operation was attempted, to cross the Dnipro and attack through Krynky. For this purpose, some 55 GMLRS were stockpiled, along with a large volume of other fires. The Ukrainian marines conducting the operation were attacking into their old training grounds and knew the terrain well. It was hoped that a surge of force across the river might turn the flank. When the crossing was made, Ukrainian forces managed to secure a lodgement on the eastern bank, and for approximately three days there was an opportunity to move a significant number of troops across. This was not attempted. The reason was simple. While a large body of troops might have been projected over the river, they could not be sustained, and the larger the force the less viable their sustainment would be. The Krynky operation does not need to be covered in detail as it was never fully carried out, but it does offer one salutary lesson to which observers should pay attention. Under modern battlefield conditions, the establishment and protection of a crossing on a wide wet gap against sustained observation and the indefinite threat of fires is a problem to which there is not yet a doctrinal answer. Given the number of these gaps in Eastern Europe, it is a problem set that deserves study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-assessing-the-causes-of-failure&quot;&gt;III. Assessing the Causes of Failure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most analyses gravitate towards the conclusion that the reasons for the difference between the failure of Russian operations in 2022 and their comparative success in 2023 is that the Russians are learning and adapting, and are becoming more tactically proficient. Although Russia has adapted its tactics, the main reason for the striking difference in the effectiveness of Russian operations is that in the preparation of the invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin’s main effort was that of its Special Services, which were supposed to destabilise Ukraine and disorganise its system of state and military administration. The military invasion was not supposed to meet serious organised resistance, other than in Donbas. The defeats suffered by the AFRF in the battles of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Kherson were primarily the consequences of an initial miscalculation in the planning of the invasion, and the employment of forces improperly structured and commanded for conventional warfighting. After the failure of the initial coup de main, attempts were made to rectify the structural shortcomings, but without an uplift in mass, and because of the losses during the opening phase of the war, the Russian military failed to achieve its objectives. In 2023, Ukraine was dealing with an enemy that had completely changed its strategy. Russia began to take seriously the planning and conduct of military operations, moving from a blitzkrieg strategy to a protracted war, with the mobilisation necessary for this through its human and industrial resources. It placed its main bet on the fact that Western partners will tire of supporting Ukraine, allowing Russia to eventually gain the necessary advantage on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for the AFRF’s operational failures in 2022 was the insufficient number of ground troops to conduct effective combat operations along multiple independent axes. In fact, the lack of the necessary forces and means for a successful full-scale invasion was one of the foremost reasons why many analysts, including in Ukrainian intelligence agencies, were sceptical about the probability of a Russian invasion in February 2022, predicting such an invasion later, in June or even September 2022, and only in the limited theatre of the south and east. Such sceptical assessments of the probability of a successful invasion allowed the Russians to achieve operational surprise, which explains the success in capturing the south of Ukraine, as well as the deep advance in the north, where the AFU did not have significant forces. The Russian plan came much closer to succeeding than is often acknowledged, but when the bet on speed failed, the plan was invalidated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failure to defeat the AFU during its initial blitzkrieg and heavy losses in people and military equipment meant that Russia faced the problem of an acute lack of the troops necessary not only to continue the offensive, but also to hold territories in the east and especially in the south. It was the lack of adequate personnel that forced the Russians to withdraw from Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy, and prevented them from organising the proper density of defences near Kharkiv, enabling the AFU to carry out a successful breakthrough there and a further offensive almost to the borders of the Luhansk region. Although Ukrainian fire control of Russian lines of supply explains the tactical decision to withdraw from Kherson, the unwillingness of the AFRF to lose the quality troops deployed there reflected the shortages in personnel elsewhere on the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in many military conflicts before, including the First and Second World Wars, after the end of the first phase of the war, which was characterised by rapid manoeuvre by the first echelon, the second phase began, during which the skirmish line stabilised, the fighting became positional, and the parties concentrated on generating the reserves to win the war. As a result of the mobilisation that began in October 2022, Russia managed by May 2023 not only to replenish its losses, but also to increase the size of the group of forces in Ukraine to approximately 420,000 personnel (not counting the units of the Russian Guard and the police involved in running an occupation regime), as well as to establish the production of weapons and military equipment in the volumes necessary to support their operations. As a result, the Ukrainian offensive, which began in June 2023, was conducted in conditions that differed significantly from those that prevailed when the plan for the offensive was developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In autumn 2022, the AFRF in Ukraine consisted of 130 battalion-tactical groups and separate units of the 1st and 2nd Army Corps with a total number of about 200,000 servicemen, about 930 tanks, more than 2,500 armoured combat vehicles, 1,350 artillery systems, 660 MLRS and 40 operational-tactical missile systems (OTMS). By the beginning of June 2023, Russian ground forces in Ukraine comprised about 420,000 personnel, 1,980 tanks, 4,450 armoured combat vehicles, 2,750 artillery systems, 860 MLRS and 46 OTMS. During this time, the AFRF abandoned the use of battalion-tactical groups and switched to the army management system, cohering 50 brigades, 128 regiments, 102 separate battalions and about 50 combined units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that Russia’s group of forces in Ukraine, outlined above, constitutes its combat troops. These troops were not responsible for guarding the Russian border, a task undertaken by other parts of the AFRF. Nor were they primarily concerned with supporting the administration of the occupied territories. For this, the Russian Federation had deployed in Ukraine 25,000 servicemen of the Russian Guard, fielding their own 520 armoured combat vehicles, about 140 artillery systems and 22 helicopters. By contrast, the AFU’s combat power had to hold the entire Ukrainian border, stretching out AFU resources while the AFRF maintained freedom to commit resources on particular axes. The presence of AFRF units on the Russian–Ukrainian border, their constant shelling of Ukrainian territory with MLRS, artillery and mortars, airstrikes and the use of sabotage groups forced Ukraine to keep part of its troops in the north, making it impossible to transfer them to other directions. A further 50,000 troops of the AFU were committed to generating mobile air defence groups with their necessary support echelon to defeat a sustained Russian long-range strike campaign throughout Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to use artillery to compensate for the limited force density along much of the front limited the concentration of firepower on the main effort. The largest number of 155-calibre guns simultaneously operating on the Orikhiv–Tokmak axis was 55 units. Ammunition levels for Ukrainian artillery varied throughout the offensive. At its peak, these reached approximately 70 rounds per gun per day for those guns on the main effort. However, ammunition supplies were uneven and would peak and trough, so that for periods of the offensive, Ukrainian guns had as little as 10 rounds per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both at the beginning and during the conduct of the Ukrainian offensive operation, the AFU did not have a numerical advantage over the enemy in the number of personnel, combat systems and ammunition, or enablers necessary for successful offensive operations, especially against a well-organised and echeloned line of defence. At times, the AFU did establish localised superiority, but this could rarely be maintained as forces advanced. The balance of forces in many cases was not in favour of Ukraine, which forced Ukrainian units to storm the positions of a more numerous enemy. Conditions were especially unfavourable given the lack of air support. Against this, Ukraine had some qualitative advantages in both troops and equipment, but this did not provide a sufficient offset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of numerical advantage, the AFU counted on a moral advantage due to both the high level of motivation of the Ukrainian troops and the low morale of Russian troops observed during their winter offensive. To some extent, Ukraine repeated the mistake that Russia had made during the first stage of the war, counting on shock induced by offensive operations preventing the enemy from putting up an adequate resistance. This theory of success was a poor planning assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the operational level, therefore, the Ukrainian offensive failed because the plan was not properly calibrated to the available resources. Nor were appropriate troops assigned to the tasks for which they were suited. Undertrained personnel spearheaded the main effort, while experienced troops were committed to diversionary or fixing axes. Ukraine’s international partners failed to mobilise industry early in the conflict, while over-optimistic planning assumptions by Ukrainian planners based on the conditions prevailing before Russian mobilisation had grave consequences. The reason to place such emphasis on this point is that Ukraine’s international partners missed their decision points for industrial mobilisation, while Ukraine missed its decision points for the mobilisation and adequate training of personnel. It is thus vital that for future operations Ukraine and its partners do not lull themselves into believing that an under-resourced operation has a strong likelihood of succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this foremost operational point, numerous shortcomings of the preparation of the Ukrainian offensive can be identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-lack-of-surprise&quot;&gt;A Lack of Surprise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the anticipated mechanisms enabling success during the Ukrainian offensive was the shock to Russian troops. In the initial plan, this was hoped to enable the 12 brigades to break six enemy regiments across 30 km of front. When planners realised that this was not possible, it was hoped that the violence of the initial attack would dislodge the defenders. Where tactical surprise was achieved during the war, as in the Kharkiv offensive in 2022, Ukrainian forces effectively dislocated Russian troops. Conversely, in both Kherson and on the Orikhiv–Tokmak axis, surprise was not achieved, and operational security failed. In the Kherson direction, the Ukrainian government signalled the intention to attack on this axis. The subsequent decision to attack Kherson was therefore made against a prepared defence and was neither particularly successful in terms of the ground assaults nor did it cause shock among Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Orikhiv–Tokmak axis, the failure of operational security occurred at multiple levels. At the strategic level, leaks of top secret information from Ukraine’s international partners (including terrain analysis and other materials) gave the Russians a precise picture of the Ukrainian assault force’s structure, anticipated capabilities, limitations and options for axes of advance. Furthermore, the public messaging from the Ukrainian government, and public discourse from partners, gave Russia a clear understanding of the timing of a likely assault and informed AFRF planning. Finally, Russian penetration of Ukrainian communications systems enabled capture of a range of materials. The result was that when the offensive started, Ukrainian efforts to compartmentalise planning often left friendly forces with less understanding of the wider plan than Russian commanders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson is clear: future operations must be accompanied by appropriate deception and more effective operational security. For Ukraine, this means less public telegraphing of intentions. However, there are also lessons for Ukraine’s partners about the transparency of its political discourse on collective planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;inadequate-force-generation&quot;&gt;Inadequate Force Generation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the greater human reserves of the Russian Federation, Ukraine must seek qualitative superiority among its forces. For situations in which the AFU are on the defensive, this has largely been achieved. For offensive operations, 2023 demonstrated that the system of training and force generation is not producing sufficient force quality to execute a high tempo of operations. There are several reasons for this. At the most basic level, the training is appropriate neither in duration nor content. There are differences of approach between AFU and NATO members on how battle inoculation should be carried out. Nevertheless, restrained use of BATSIM (battlefield simulation) and other techniques to habituate trainees to the felt effect of artillery manifested in a proportion of units performing poorly early in the offensive. A lack of familiarity and training with artillery for example saw troops unwilling to keep pace with close support fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other fundamental problem related to drill proficiency. With five weeks training at Operation Interflex, and perhaps a month of collective training before being committed, troops did not have a well-rehearsed repertoire of battlefield movements they could execute at pace. Tactical control of direct fires was also very limited, partly because safety constraints on training without sufficient time to lay strong foundations prevented fire and movement at platoon and company level from being adequately drilled. In consequence, fire discipline was largely poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method adopted by the Ukrainian military to make up for this force quality problem was to select a cadre of assault troops from within its units, such that a battalion might generate two platoons of assault troops, while the remainder of the battalion formed conventional companies. In practice, this meant that rather than being able to echelon through one another to maintain offensive momentum, each attack had to be deliberately planned and would culminate on completion. Furthermore, the loss of these assault troops would remove the offensive combat power of the battalion. This made commanders cautious, further impeding tempo. Although the approach adopted by the AFU made sense in the limited time available, the time for training was inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem was the training of brigades as a cohered formation. With most brigade staffs fixed on the front to manage defensive sectors, Ukraine has struggled to train brigades, or to exercise battalions beneath a brigade headquarters. The result was that when Ukrainian units reached the battle area, they tended to plan and execute separate company actions, managed by the brigade headquarters and supported by brigade fires, rather than conforming to a brigade scheme of manoeuvre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to raise force quality for offensive operations through a deliberate process taking approximately eight months, with up to 18 weeks of individual training and collective training thereafter, must be factored in to war planning. Planning by Ukraine or its international partners has rarely been conducted over such horizons, especially among the political echelon. But failure to plan in this way means that the available force will not be suited to the envisaged task. The largest attacks during the offensive were battalion attacks. This reflected the small cadre of trained staff officers able to synchronise larger operations. To overmatch Russian units, it is necessary to increase the scale at which Ukrainian units can operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deficiencies-in-planning&quot;&gt;Deficiencies in Planning&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original concept of operations, as previously described, envisaged a 12-brigade operation taking seven days to breach the defence lines along a 30 km frontage and isolate Tokmak. The evidence suggests that had this concentration of forces and tempo been achieved, a breakthrough to Tokmak was possible. However, this concept defining requirements was unburdened by the limitations of the actual force employed. The original concept was reasonable. But when the concept was turned into a plan, reflecting the limitations of the forces that had been generated, the time that had elapsed, and thus the disposition of the enemy, errors in planning emerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, the theory of success for the operation as executed depended on a collapse in Russian forces, but the forces and means were not concentrated sufficiently to achieve this effect. It is not evident on what basis planners thought this would be achieved. Instead, planning appears to have proceeded on the basis of significant optimism bias. This appears to have stemmed partly from a belief that Russia’s collapse around Kharkiv arose from a lack of morale, when in reality it arose from Russia’s lack of sufficient troops. This is not a new problem, but given the extent to which NATO members hope to offset the enemy’s numerical superiority, methodologies for more accurate assessments of the morale of an enemy seem worth developing. The UK, in particular, has for some time emphasised the importance of information manoeuvre and the cognitive dimension of war. It is evident, however, that planners did not correctly evaluate Russia’s mindset or vulnerabilities in this regard. Thus, it appears there are insufficient means for staffs to sense or conduct battle damage assessment on morale, to enable accurate planning for how a collapse might be induced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also evident that planners failed to properly apportion the right forces for the operation. Rather than being recovered from the front to form the core of new units, experienced troops were instead left with diminishing levels of mechanised equipment and were committed on various diversionary axes, such as Bakhmut, or in fixing actions on either side of the main effort. When troops from these units were thereafter pushed into the offensive force, the units lacked critical means, including demining equipment, to be able to succeed. The decline in equipment quality in follow-on forces was also pronounced, such that Ukrainian units began to have to attempt offensive breaching operations with MaxxPros and other vehicles unsuited to the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain planning failures were made jointly between Ukraine and its international partners, for example, the weight given to effects of deep strikes, which were intended to disrupt the Russian defences. While the campaign targeting Crimea was well planned, the deep battle in support of the main effort employed too few munitions against too diverse an array of targets to ever deliver a critical scale of effect. Nor were the application of long-range precision fires synchronised with tactical actions that would best exploit the pressure placed on the Russian defensive system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another curious element of the planning is the lack of mitigations in place to overcome identified Russian strengths. During wargames carried out with Ukraine’s international partners prior to the offensive, a number of Russian capabilities were identified as especially problematic. Russian aviation was one such capability. Yet the operation was launched without any means to counter the threat from Russian attack aviation. The US eventually approved the use of ATACMs in October to strike Russian helicopters at their airfields. This was all very well, but by October Russian attack aviation had already played its part in blunting Ukraine’s offensive. By then, the application of ATACMs merely contributed to an attritional writing down of Russian systems. It did not enable manoeuvre. The point here is not that ATACMs were the answer to aviation. Russia tactically adapted to mitigate the risk to its airfields within days of these strikes. The point is that nothing was done to mitigate the risk when it mattered. This problem was not limited to the issue of aviation. Minefields were similarly identified as a major problem. At the beginning of the offensive, Ukraine had significantly fewer demining vehicles than would be considered the minimum required in doctrine. This had predictable results, which had been identified by Ukraine and its partners during the pre-offensive wargames. Yet Ukraine’s partners continued to push demining vehicles into Ukraine as late as August, when the US provided M117s. The AFU took two months learning how to operate and maintain these vehicles so they were not ready to be used until October 2023, after the offensive had completely culminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about this is that Ukraine’s international partners provided equipment in a manner that was completely inconsistent with NATO doctrine, such that Ukraine could not concentrate a critical mass of the relevant capabilities at the decisive point. Much of this failure was political. The US had recommended releasing DPICM to Ukraine in autumn 2022 and ATACMs early in 2023. The release of these systems was approved late. The question that NATO members must confront is whether their systems of government prompt leaders to make decisions when they must be made if they are to have their intended effect, or whether the system allows for delay beyond the point of relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-identifying-emerging-tactical-challenges&quot;&gt;IV. Identifying Emerging Tactical Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conduct of large-scale offensive breaching operations is one of the hardest tasks that land forces must be able to carry out. In the First World War, it took the Entente powers three years to develop the concepts and capabilities and generate the capacity to effectively breach German defences on the Western Front. Holding units that are equipped and trained for this operation represents the largest resource commitment in most armies. For example, while the UK has many units that have widespread utility, only 3 UK Division, which is by far the most expensive element of the Field Army, is expected to be able to conduct large-scale offensive breaching, and it is at present not equipped to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctrinal framework for offensive breaching has remained essentially unchanged since the formulation of AirLand Battle in the 1980s. The last time offensive breaching was conducted by Western forces at scale was in Operation Desert Storm in 1991, and this appeared to vindicate the equipment, formation structure, tactics and doctrine underpinning AirLand Battle. Prior to 2023, the only large-scale offensive breaching operation to have been conducted in a conventional war since 1991 was Azerbaijan’s operation to retake Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020. This operation was, however, carried out against an Armenian force that was barely modernised from the 1980s. Thus, the established formula once again proved successful. Breaching operations in Iraq during the war against Islamic State and in Afghanistan during fighting with the Taliban required clearing through complex fields of IEDs, but these were not covered by artillery, and so coalition forces dictated the tempo of manoeuvre. It is therefore reasonable to argue that Ukraine’s attempts to breach the Surovikin Line over summer 2023 were the first attempts at large-scale offensive breaching operations in 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over that timeframe, new technologies have had a considerable impact on how armies fight. It is therefore worth examining the experience of Ukrainian forces to assess the extent to which established doctrine remains valid and where it may need to be adapted or revised. These lessons are not only relevant for Ukraine’s forces, as they endeavour to recover and prepare for future offensive operations, but also for Ukraine’s international partners, who must be credible if they are to deter Russia from challenging Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fighting in Ukraine during 2023 revealed several requirements and problem sets that have not widely confronted NATO forces and are not effectively accounted for in Western doctrine. These issues need to be thought through during the design of future forces and operations. Several of these challenges are unpacked in this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pervasive-observation-and-precision-fires&quot;&gt;Pervasive Observation and Precision Fires&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the offensive, both sides made extensive use of UAVs to watch the battlefield over the frontline and into opposing rear areas. Russian troops made substantial use of Lancet-3M loitering munitions to deliver precision strikes against Ukrainian artillery and support elements. Ukrainian forces, meanwhile, used an expanding number of first-person-view UAVs as they moved onto the defensive, and as their own availability of artillery ammunition diminished. For both sides, these capabilities have proved more impactful for defensive than offensive operations. This is primarily because it is easier to deconflict these systems when one’s own forces are manoeuvring less, because using them in the close against advancing troops means they are in closer proximity to their control antennae than to enemy jamming, and because it is the attacking party that must increase its signature and will outrun its ability to use deception or decoys to protect itself, as the attacker must advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of EW and low-altitude air defence for offensive operations did exist in older doctrine. Largely, however, this was a divisional responsibility, as it remains in US concepts. Today, the localised ability to generate precision fires means that all units require electronic protection. In concept, advancing formations must be able to create electronic barriers, and since sub-units are unlikely to have dedicated air defence, systems must be multifunctional, with the ability to engage small aerial targets. Electronic protection is too vulnerable if kept on a small number of dedicated platforms. Instead, while electronic protection modules must be programmable and relatively autonomous, they must be widely distributed. Antennae will become a crucial layer in a protection system, vulnerable to direct fire. They must therefore be replaceable, rather than integral to the unit generating the jamming frequencies. Projecting navigational interference is particularly important for providing area defence against precision fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there is the dilemma, noted above, of how a force that must create a time-limited snowdome of protection from precision fires can avoid increasing its exposure to statistical artillery (non-precision munitions). The old answer – to win the counterfires battle – is only a partial solution, because high-fidelity ISR now allows fewer guns to deliver more concentrated effects, thus raising the threshold of suppression needed to protect the force. Thus, alongside the requirement to protect the force from stand-in observation, it is also necessary to be able to defeat enemy longer-range UAVs, either at low altitude but stood off up to 10 km, or at medium altitude above the MANPADS ceiling. Combined with the fact that the targets being engaged will often be relatively inexpensive, this presents a key challenge for short-ranged air defence. There is also the requirement to shift the task from counterbattery kills to left-of-launch targeting of enemy artillery. This brings into the close battle concepts that had previously been more relevant to discussions of Integrated Air and Missile Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electromagnetic-battlespace-management&quot;&gt;Electromagnetic Battlespace Management&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The force that can employ precision fires responsively is likely to be disproportionately efficient compared with their adversary. The ability to minimise concentration is simultaneously dependent on coordination of activities at reach or beyond line of sight. This depends on access to the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). The result is that even without enemy EW, the EMS is becoming crowded. The number of systems communicating is increasing. The volume of data being passed is increasing. And the advantages to be gained versus vulnerabilities ceded by not contesting the EMS are shifting to a point where although forces must be able to revert without their primary systems, this does not mean they should accept loss of communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contested nature of the EMS and its impact on the efficiency of fires and manoeuvre must be addressed. In the defence, runners, ground-laid cable and other reversionary methods can be used to limit traffic, signature and vulnerability. On the offence, these are not viable options. Without careful frequency management, forces are liable to engage in widespread fratricide in the EMS, including degrading the efficiency and survivability of their own UAVs. This was a serious problem in Ukraine, and often caused commanders to limit electronic protection to their forces, thus increasing their own situational awareness but also giving freedom to enemy ISR and fires. Russian forces would reset their frequencies every 24 hours, deconflicting UAV orbits, and would synchronise EW with manoeuvre, so that when precision coordinates needed to be generated, electronic protection would dip before being brought back up. This was achieved despite the AFRF distributing EW capabilities to the company echelon. For Ukraine, absolute shortage of systems reduced the complexity of the task, but most EW was nevertheless managed at the brigade echelon, and even then was often not maximally exploited, because of the difficulties it created for C2 and ISR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to allocate sufficient bandwidths for software-defined systems to avoid broad-band jamming, and yet have enough spectrum available for the range of systems in a modern force, is a serious problem. It is also one that most military personnel are not trained to manage. Yet this is becoming a key planning constraint at all echelons. There is a need for signallers to be trained differently to support these requirements down to brigade and battlegroup level. At the same time, commanders in the combat arms need to be better trained in how to use EW troops and how to plan manoeuvre in the EMS. Increasing the skills of signallers is of little value if the level of understanding among the other arms diverges rather than converges, leading to the capabilities being neglected or misapplied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;accelerated-capability-refresh-cycles&quot;&gt;Accelerated Capability Refresh Cycles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not a new observation to say that innovative capabilities have their greatest impact when first fielded and then offer less advantage as the enemy adapts. This problem was well understood in the wake of the First World War. Today, however, software-defined systems are highly vulnerable to bespoke electronic countermeasures, while also being disproportionately effective when compared with non-software-defined capabilities. The result is that a force must use software-defined systems to be competitive, but the peak effectiveness of a software-defined capability is therefore operationally short-lived and, once the enemy has adapted, tactically volatile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This manifested in various ways during the 2023 offensive. First, Western planning assumptions about the effects deliverable by precision munitions proved exaggerated, owing to enemy countermeasures. Excalibur and GMLRS suffered from this. Second, Ukraine found that with systems such as UAVs, a rapid refresh rate of both software and radios was necessary to maintain their effectiveness. This impinged, however, on their ability to scale production and therefore to reap the rewards of their technical advantage. Instead, innovations would be tested at small scale and deployed at moderate scale when industry could begin supplying a solution. However, the adversary would develop exquisite countermeasures before production could be accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is evident that this interaction is going to be a feature of future conflict. It poses major challenges to how NATO militaries contract industry, how systems are tested and validated, and how training and safety of systems is managed. Other than for night-one capabilities, designed to open the door, it is clear that maintaining technological advantage, and thus a qualitative edge, must be premised on having software engineers in tactical formations empowered to interfere with systems, and the ability to rapidly swap out hardware components like radios without having to discard the platforms to which they were attached. Vendors must be incentivised to provide sub-systems and to understand that there will be repeat custom cyclically as they adapt their products, rather than refining a single product and endeavouring to lock the customer into keeping with it. In many states, this will require legislative changes to oversight. Within operational – rather than tactical – timeframes, however, this is crucial to maintaining tempo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;diversification-of-last-mile-resupply&quot;&gt;Diversification of Last-Mile Resupply&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The persistence of surveillance over the frontline, combined with cheap and scalable precision strike using UAVs, poses a particular threat to the resupply of forces on the offence because the available ground lines of communication become constrained to established breaches and are therefore easy to monitor. Furthermore, deception and other methods aimed at keeping resupply vehicles alive are irrelevant once they are forced to traverse known routes, where the enemy will not have to deal with false positives. Moreover, the pressure put by the enemy on lead elements through counterattack means that they can impose when resupply and casualty evacuation is most critical, limiting the agency the offensive force has to shape conditions to enable last-mile resupply. Resupply vehicles must also be supported in breaching artillery-delivered scattered mines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One answer for this is that last-mile resupply becomes a combined arms endeavour requiring the layering of air defence, counterbattery fires, EW, engineering support and other measures to create windows of opportunity for movement. This is extremely resource intensive and, in Ukraine’s case, resources are lacking. In certain circumstances, resupply may have to become the main effort of a force’s supporting arms, but this is highly undesirable and, in any case, limits the number of resupplies that can be achieved. Although not directly related to last-mile resupply, the inability to advance less protected support platforms such as artillery and medical support, owing to the persistent threat of precision strike over the forward line of own troops (FLOT), is a further challenge that limits the ability to keep support and enablers moving forwards with the combat arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, methods must be found for diversifying last-mile resupply. The UK, in particular, has been experimenting extensively with uncrewed systems in this role. While helicopters are expensive to operate and vulnerable in the face of Russian air defences, UAVs may offer a means to move pallets of food, water and ammunition forwards. Using uncrewed ground vehicles for breaching similarly offers the opportunity to widen and multiply the lanes through which supplies can pass. Uncrewed ground vehicle technology is not currently ideally suited to offensive obstacle breaching, because it is easily knocked out through damage to key sensors and often depends on remote control, while such breaching must be done either from close proximity to the vehicle or via fixed cable. Once behind the FLOT, however, such systems have significant potential, and experimentation in this space could mature the capability until it is able to support offensive breaching operations. Increasing the throughput of materiel and thereby extending the reach and endurance of a given assault unit buys time for the breach to be expanded, for additional forces to echelon through and ultimately for the maintenance of momentum. Medical evacuation via UAV is more morally complex, but in many instances may improve the rate of survival considerably by allowing casualties to be recovered across complex or denied terrain to a medical facility in a hardened position where a better standard of care can be provided. Improving the rate of survival from injury also has a positive effect on morale, contributing to the maintenance of momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important context in which NATO members should examine this problem is how it relates to gap crossing. Russia’s control of Kherson Oblast was ultimately rendered unsustainable because of Ukraine’s ability to interdict crossing points. Ukraine’s decision not to exploit its opportunity in Krynky was driven by the assessment that a force large enough to have any significant impact on the left bank of the Dnipro could not be supported across it. Any terrain analysis of NATO’s eastern flank shows that wet gaps are regular terrain features. How NATO members can develop capabilities for emplacing and protecting crossings is therefore a vital conceptual area for exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vulnerability-of-critical-enablers&quot;&gt;Vulnerability of Critical Enablers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final significant challenge that must be overcome conceptually is the vulnerability of critical enablers such as engineering vehicles. Historically, this has been addressed by heavily protecting these platforms and by having them covered by main battle tanks. The concept has been that although ATGM operators and hostile main battle tanks will seek to engage breaching vehicles, this will reveal their positions and allow them to be engaged and destroyed by overwatching direct fires. Psychologically, the threat of this rapid and lethal response has the effect of suppressing the scale at which threats manifest. Speed then reduces the time available for the enemy to safely execute engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under modern conditions, this concept of overwatch is deeply flawed. The problem is that an increasing array of threat systems, from FPV drones to non-line-of-sight ATGMs and UAV-mounted laser designation for artillery munitions, can be launched and directed from concealed positions. This means that individual prestige equipment can be picked out. It also extends the timeframe within which it can be targeted, because those launching these munitions can fire multiple times and can concentrate on guiding their munition without concern about receiving fire. The result is a high probability of mission kill against key enabling equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resolving this problem requires new approaches to offensive suppression and to the design of enabling equipment. For offensive suppression, the utilisation of loitering munitions, provided with target coordinates by EW baselines, could enable strikes on operators of threat systems that are otherwise safe beyond line of sight of their targets. An equivalent to the Lancet-3M would be very useful for this. It would also require an uplift in the density of Ukrainian EW baselines at brigade level to identify enemy UAV operators and engage them. For defensive measures, the utilisation of multispectral smoke would help, although not entirely alleviate, the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical line of effort, however, is that if these vehicles can be picked out then it follows that they will be attrited. More of them are therefore required. At present, these are often prestige assets and are heavily protected, able to carry out a range of functions. It seems likely that the number of vehicles in engineering units needs to increase, while their flexibility and complexity needs to decrease to make such an uplift in platforms affordable. Furthermore, the diversification of tasks that can be carried out with modules mounted on other armoured vehicles should be prioritised. If such systems are targetable, then the aim should be to make fewer targets single points of failure in the ability of the force to breach obstacles. It is notable that Israel, when entering Gaza, determined that it required 20 D9 armoured bulldozers per brigade to overcome the anticipated IED threat. D9s may not be ideally suited to combat in Ukraine, but the density of such vehicles is a good yardstick for what should be the aim. The requirement for such an uplift in the number of platforms speaks to a need to change the design priorities for the platforms dedicated to these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The causes of the failure of Ukraine’s offensive operations in 2023 may be summarised as a lack of personnel and critical materiel, inadequate time to train and cohere the relevant forces, the misallocation of personnel to the identified axes, and a lack of solutions to several identified tactical problems. Ensuring that these mistakes are not repeated requires a more deliberate and longer force generation process, and for Ukraine’s international partners to calibrate equipment provision to the outcomes they have stated they want, rather than to what is politically convenient to provide in the short term. Given that addressing these challenges requires the industrial mobilisation of Europe, and that this has started late, it will take some time before Ukraine can recommence major offensive operations. Creating the conditions for the eventual termination of the war on favourable terms must be achieved through shaping in the intervening period. This has driven a change in how Ukraine looks to fight the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the current phase of the conflict, the AFU’s focus is on inflicting maximum damage on the Russian Federation, not on liberating Ukrainian territories at any cost. On the battlefield, the AFU is prioritising the destruction of those systems that the AFRF will struggle to replace or repair. The AFU is also building extensive defensive positions to try to maximise the AFRF rate of losses for any gains made on the battlefield. Such a damage-centric approach is intended to buy the maximum possible time, both for force generation and for damage to be inflicted in the deep. For Ukraine’s international partners, provision of artillery ammunition and long-range strike systems are most important in support of this effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s capacity to continue its aggression against Ukraine is fundamentally a result of its large capital reserves. The ability to pay high salaries to contract soldiers is enabling Russia’s regeneration of forces, while money generated from petrochemical exports allows Russia to expand military equipment production, even as sanctions and supply chain disruption drive up the price. Ukraine is therefore targeting oil and gas infrastructure in Russia to initially reduce its reserves and thereafter the availability of liquid capital. Ukraine’s international partners can support this effort by targeting the manufacturing facilities of Russia’s defence industries, and the global supply chains that allow Russia to sustain the war, through rigorously enforced sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another line of effort for inflicting damage on Russia is the use of information operations to reduce Russian confidence in the rouble, and to take measures to drive up inflation. Creating a felt cost of the conflict for the Russian population, and ascribing blame for that feeling to local officials, increases the jeopardy for the Russian government as the war protracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying time and slowing Russian force expansion are ways to support the regeneration of offensive combat power. To regenerate this power, Ukraine must levy troops that it does not immediately commit as battlefield replacements, but instead allows to train collectively until they are tactically proficient. This requires the opportunity to exercise headquarters to enable Ukrainian units to operate at scale. The combat arms officers leading such formations must also be familiar with using electronic protection, reconnaissance and attack so that they can protect their units once committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning for the commitment of additional forces should not be fixed in relation to a timeline governed by political expectations. Instead, the AFU should plan a shaping operation to create the conditions for offensive operations to be possible. While critical conditions are being established, Ukraine’s international partners must work with these units to develop methods of overcoming the threat from Russian long-range fires. These include effective counter- reconnaissance capabilities, and the ability to protect the logistics routes in support of offensive operations and key enablers supporting offensive action. If these measures are not taken, Ukraine risks prolonging the conflict without shifting its trajectory, with tragic consequences for both the country and the security of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

The fragile interconnectedness of the norms urges global action to reinforce these pillars and prevent a destabilizing cascade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, nuclear norms have faced significant challenges, as exemplified by Russian president Vladimir Putin’s November 2023 decision to withdraw Russia’s ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). This decision is part of a broader trend undermining nuclear institutions, such as the breakdown of bilateral arms control dialogue and the failure to achieve consensus within the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The erosion of these norms poses a critical question for the international community: Can the nuclear order be maintained — or will it collapse under persistent contestation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper analyzes the health of three key nuclear norms: nonproliferation, nonuse, and no testing. The findings indicate that while these norms are broadly supported and critical for stability, they are increasingly contested. The research paints a picture of a network of nuclear norms under stress. This contestation is led by a relatively small cast of characters, but growing friction within nuclear institutions from multiple directions and by a wide set of actors also challenges the existing nuclear order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norm development is frequently depicted as a cascade, yet this cascade can also operate in reverse should a norm experience significant weakening. Such a reverse normative cascade has the potential to make the nuclear order collapse like a house of cards, whereby the violation of a single nuclear norm, such as the norm against testing, could have knock-on effects potentially undermining other norms, such as the one against proliferation. The interconnected nature of these norms means that a significant weakening of one could lead to a cascade effect, jeopardizing the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nuclear norms are interdependent, and a normative cascade can go both ways: While the norms are often represented as stand-alone pillars, these pillars are arranged like dominoes: if one falls, another could follow. Proliferation, for example, has historically been followed by testing, and it could undermine the credibility of not only the NPT and CTBT but also their associated norms. Similarly, any use of a nuclear weapon could call into question the entire nuclear order and its ability to restrain nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Norm cascades or reverse cascades are exacerbated by regional dynamics: For example, Russia’s suspension of arms control agreements, such as New START, correlates with its invasion of Ukraine. States’ decisions to observe norms, therefore, depend not only on the wider international security environment, but particularly on the regional security environment and perceptions of threats from neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The norm against nuclear testing is strong, but the weakest of the three: The norm against nuclear testing faces the most active contestation, highlighted by North Korea’s ongoing testing over the past decade and Russia’s potential resumption of testing. Another challenge is coming from contestation of the CTBT. One point of contestation is the treaty’s delayed entry into force, which remains a distant and unlikely prospect both because of the security environment and because of domestic political polarization, particularly within the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Treating nuclear possessors as a monolith could undermine nuclear norms: Many international actors treat all nuclear possessors as norm contesters because of nuclear modernization programs and continued reliance on nuclear weapons for deterrence. Overall, third-party responses have been strongly supportive of upholding all three norms. However, responses to potential nuclear use and nuclear threats have been less strong than the other two norms. The main example of this is the hesitant international response to Russia’s threats of nuclear use related to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Nuclear Possessors: Continue to uphold and reinforce nuclear norms through transparency, restraint, and collective efforts such as the P5 process (involving China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and the Creating an Environment for Nuclear Disarmament (CEND) initiative. Specific activities might include reciprocal visits to test sites, along with incorporating risks of emerging technologies into multilateral dialogues. To strengthen the nonproliferation norm, the United States and United Kingdom can be more explicit about the historical nonproliferation benefits of extended nuclear deterrence. Additionally, states should refrain from explicit nuclear threats or escalatory language, such as threatening “World War III.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the P3 (France, the United Kingdom, the United States): Lead efforts in risk reduction and norm reinforcement, engaging with both nuclear and non-nuclear states to address emerging threats and regional dynamics. These efforts might take place within the context of CEND, the initiative on irreversible nuclear disarmament (IND), or other new risk reduction efforts. This will require continuing to operate within the P5 process, but the P3 can also engage either bilaterally or multilaterally with a wider group of non-nuclear weapon states (NNWS) to understand and strengthen norms at the regional level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Non-Nuclear Possessors and Civil Society: Play an active role in norm enforcement, particularly in the context of the NPT. One specific area where NNWS and civil society can strengthen nuclear norms is to avoid treating nuclear possessors as a monolith. They should also continue to pressure the P5 to continue with their dialogues and to address the risks of weakening norms in the context of emerging technologies, transparency of doctrine, and risk reduction initiatives. This group should also play an important role in championing the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty and CTBT. A final point is that civil society can lead the way in public denouncements of norm violations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is a call not only for nuclear weapon states (NWS) to uphold the nuclear norm network, but also for leadership by key states, such as the United Kingdom and United States, to engage with NNWS to strengthen norms and hold norm violators accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 13, 2024, Russian president Vladimir Putin added to his list of nuclear threats, stating that Moscow was ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” This statement was the latest in a string of challenges to nuclear institutions, including the breakdown of bilateral arms control dialogue and the failure to reach consensus in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), often cited as the cornerstone of the nuclear order. In a statement to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) in 2024, for example, UK ambassador James Kariuki cited the importance of the NPT in “preventing the erosion of non-proliferation.” Nuclear norms are being tested from multiple directions, and how the international community responds to these challenges will determine if the nuclear order can be stabilized through existing institutions or whether it faces an era of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examining the status of nuclear norms is not a purely academic exercise, although much of the thinking about norms is rooted in scholarship. The health of nuclear norms also has direct policy implications. Policy objectives for the international community, particularly for nuclear weapon states (NWS) with unique nuclear responsibilities, include upholding existing nuclear norms so as to avoid escalation to nuclear use or nuclear proliferation. The nuclear order, to include institutions and norms, is important because it provides stability and predictability on nuclear risks in a time of growing uncertainty. Treaties, norms, and other commonly observed practices inhibit potentially dangerous behaviors such as nuclear proliferation or testing, along with upholding the taboo against nuclear use. But a worsening security environment and new technologies, among other factors, threaten to undermine nuclear norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nuclear norms are being tested from multiple directions, and how the international community responds to these challenges will determine if the nuclear order can be stabilized through existing institutions or whether it faces an era of uncertainty.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three norms serve as the foundation of the nuclear order: nonproliferation, nonuse, and no testing. This study uses an analytical framework to assess the health of these three nuclear norms and to identify policy options for strengthening them. The research paints a picture of an increasingly contested network of nuclear norms. This contestation is led by a relatively small cast of characters, but growing friction within nuclear institutions from multiple directions and by a wide set of actors also challenges the existing nuclear order. Much of the current contestation is driven by regional and domestic factors — including individuals — rather than by major strategic shifts or great power competition. Norm development is frequently depicted as a cascade, yet this cascade can also operate in reverse should a norm experience significant weakening. Such a reverse normative cascade has the potential to make the nuclear order collapse like a house of cards, whereby the violation of a single nuclear norm, such as the norm against testing, could have knock-on effects potentially undermining other norms, such as the one against proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper proceeds in three sections. First, it provides an overview of the three key nuclear norms. Second, it uses an analytical framework to assess the health of nuclear norms and identify which are strongest as well as which are being contested and by whom on the basis of concordance, third-party responses, compliance, and implementation. This framework is derived from robust scholarship on norm evolution and health, and it demonstrates the value of bridging the academic and policy communities on pressing nuclear issues. Finally, the paper summarizes the four main findings from the analytical framework and offers a series of policy recommendations for strengthening norms, such as greater transparency, cooperative efforts to reduce nuclear risks, and public denouncement of norm violations. The paper is a call not only for NWS to uphold the nuclear norm network, but also for leadership by key states, such as the United Kingdom and United States, to engage with non-nuclear weapon states (NNWS) to strengthen norms and hold norm violators accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-nuclear-norms&quot;&gt;Three Nuclear Norms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nonproliferation, Nonuse, and No Testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Krepon, in his 2021 book Winning and Losing the Nuclear Peace, emphasized the importance of sustaining the norms against nuclear proliferation, the use of nuclear weapons in warfare, and further nuclear weapons testing. Krepon argued that arms control efforts should focus on upholding these norms. Like Krepon, this paper does not include norms of disarmament or deterrence in its analysis, given that disarmament and abolition “reflect aspirational standards that have been beyond reach for every generation that has lived uneasily with nuclear danger. . . . The human costs of continued warfare have been great, but not anywhere near as great as in wars fought before the Bomb was invented.” Similarly, it does not include disarmament as a norm because while disarmament is captured in NPT Article VI and nuclear arsenals have been reduced by approximately 88 percent since the height of the Cold War, progress toward disarmament has stagnated and is not a consistent practice. Additionally, scholarship by Jean-Baptiste Jeangene Vilmer and Lawrence Freedman has demonstrated that nuclear disarmament does not constitute a norm because it does not have a norm “entrepreneur” among nuclear possessors and may fail to fully emerge. Nuclear deterrence, conversely, remains a consistent practice among nuclear possessors and states covered by extended nuclear deterrence (such as within NATO), and it is also occasionally cited as consistent with the norm of nonuse. But nuclear deterrence remains widely contested among NNWS and much of civil society, and it has not reached the same widespread acceptance as the nuclear taboo, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the outset, it is important to recognize the potential limits of focusing on norms as an indicator of the strength of the nuclear order and as a policy framework. Norms are intended to set rules of the road to shape broader behaviors. The hope is that a norm violation would inspire widespread condemnation and outrage. However, sometimes outrage is not enough to shape states’ behavior in the face of unprecedented security threats. Norms are neither valued nor observed symmetrically among states, possessors and non-possessors alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table below summarizes the three nuclear norms and their approximate years of origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RNEU3kC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Nuclear Norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nuclear nonproliferation norm is defined as a set of principles, agreements, and international efforts aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, fissionable material, and weapons-applicable nuclear technology and information. Koplow, for example, defines the nonproliferation regime as “the set of treaties, agreements, conventions, formal and informal groupings, rules, and norms that seek to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.” Despite four nuclear-armed countries remaining outside of the 1968 NPT, nuclear nonproliferation has been marked by the widespread international recognition that having more states with nuclear weapons would be destabilizing and could increase the risks of nuclear use. The treaty itself, supported by 191 countries, states that “the proliferation of nuclear weapons would seriously enhance the danger of nuclear war.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present analysis focuses on the norm against horizontal proliferation: the spread of nuclear weapons and materials between states or other international actors. This paper does not include so-called vertical proliferation (i.e., nuclear modernization) as part of the norm. Established nuclear powers, including the United States, Russia, and China, continue to modernize, and in some cases expand, their arsenals, which challenges the emergence of a norm against vertical proliferation. Despite their commitments to nuclear disarmament, these states justify their proliferation efforts based on security imperatives, technological advancements, and the perceived necessity of maintaining credible deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The norm against nuclear weapon use is largely based on the recognition of the potentially catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear detonations and the potential for escalation associated with the use of nuclear weapons. It dates back over seven decades, emerging after the United States used atomic weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The norm endured the end of the nuclear monopoly with the development of nuclear weapons by the Soviet Union, as well as the intense geopolitical rivalry of the Cold War era, when the threat of nuclear warfare loomed large. However, despite the temptation to employ nuclear weapons, both superpowers exhibited restraint, recognizing the immense consequences of nuclear conflict and the risk of mutual assured destruction. As Nina Tannenwald highlights, for example, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and Secretary of State Dean Rusk opposed the use of nuclear weapons during the Vietnam War because of the fallout risks and unacceptable destruction, reinforcing the taboo against nuclear use. Similarly, the Soviet Union chose to lose the war in Afghanistan rather than seek to achieve its objectives through “winning” with the use of nuclear weapons. Subsequent diplomatic efforts, international treaties, and various arms control agreements — such as the 1973 Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War — strengthened the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the norm against nuclear testing refers to a shared understanding that states will refrain from conducting explosive nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere, underwater, in outer space, underground, or anywhere on earth. The first nuclear test was conducted by the United States in July 1945. After that, nuclear testing quickly became a crucial aspect of the Cold War competition between Washington and Moscow. The United States conducted 1,032 tests and the Soviet Union conducted 715, with the Castle Bravo test being the worst radiological disaster in U.S. history due to its contamination of local civilians on the Marshall Islands. The subsequent arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union fueled an extensive period of testing in different domains. However, concerns over the environmental and humanitarian consequences led to international efforts to halt testing, beginning as early as 1954. After a testing moratorium was put in place between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union between 1958 and 1961, as well as limited test ban agreements, a new test ban was proposed in 1990. The norm is now supported by various agreements and initiatives aimed at reducing the risks associated with nuclear testing. Major legal mechanisms to identify concordance with the norm are the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT), which prohibited atmospheric testing, and its successor, the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which further restricted nuclear testing. The CTBT has not yet entered into force. Since it was opened for signature, none of the NPT’s NWS have engaged in nuclear testing; however, India and Pakistan tested in 1998, and North Korea continues to test or threaten to test nuclear weapons as part of its nuclear signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to acknowledge at the outset a high degree of dynamism across the three norms, as evident in their evolution, interaction, and roles in shaping international relations. They essentially form a network of reinforcing mechanisms for nuclear stability. The norm against the use of nuclear weapons, for example, emerged amid Cold War rivalries, with both superpowers laying the groundwork for mutual restraint. Recognizing that any conflict between the two would have catastrophic consequences, President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev agreed at the Geneva Summit in 1985 that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Since the emergence of these norms, their robustness has varied due to fluctuations in levels of enforcement, adherence, and the institutional strength of the United Nations and other international bodies. Despite varying degrees of strength over time, these norms, working in concert, serve as the foundation of the nuclear order, highlighting the dynamic interplay between policy, historical evolution, and contemporary challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-health-of-nuclear-norms&quot;&gt;The Health of Nuclear Norms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following section assesses the robustness and health of the three nuclear norms. Informed by case studies in security and humanitarian law, an analytical framework from Nicole Deitelhoff and Lisbeth Zimmermann identifies conditions affecting the strength, resilience, and durability of global norms. While it can seem in the nuclear policy discourse that these nuclear norms are on the verge of disappearing, the framework shows that they tend to be much more robust than many others in international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four common critical indicators across norms in security studies: concordance, third-party responses, compliance, and implementation. The first two constitute discourse-based metrics of a norm’s strength, whereas the third and fourth components are practice-based and entail specific behaviors. The four indicators are equally weighted to evaluate a norm’s robustness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concordance with the norm describes the acceptance of a norm’s legitimacy by a state or the general public. It is characterized by belief in norm-enforcing entities, including institutions tasked with monitoring or implementing the norm. Concordance is also measured by the absolute and relative number of ratifications and the standard and quality of opt-out clauses. High concordance, for example, would see universal or near-universal participation in international treaties, with few, if any, opt-out clauses. Low concordance, conversely, would be shown by the absence of international agreements capturing a norm.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third-party responses to norm violations can include discursive and material sanctioning. Strong third-party responses include universal sanctioning to noncompliance. Weak responses, such as ignoring or directly or indirectly endorsing violations, would rank low in third-party responses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compliance indicates behavior consistent with norms. This is evaluated by how widespread or rare compliance is. All norms encounter a certain amount of noncompliance, often inadvertent, and compliance alone does not explain robustness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implementation of a norm is critical and can help illustrate when norms withstand challenges. This is measured through the inclusion of norms in policy papers and protocols, the creation of institutions, or the adoption of norms into domestic law. Compliance and implementation are practice-based dimensions to measure the robustness of norms over time and across cases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of this framework offers insights into the robustness of international norms. Table 2 provides an overall assessment of the strength of the nuclear norms, evaluating them from moderate, to strong, to very strong. The table includes some nonexhaustive examples. Justification for the metrics of “Very Strong” to “Moderate” is explained below in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5BxtjRc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Assessing Nuclear Norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note, however, that this framework alone does not inherently capture dynamic factors, such as the mutually reinforcing nature of many of these norms. Nor does it capture the evolution of the norms over time, an important point of analysis given changing strategic and technological landscapes. Below is a more in-depth analysis, including consideration of dynamism across the norms, to better understand the health of the three nuclear norms and their relationships to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nonproliferation&quot;&gt;Nonproliferation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The norm against nuclear proliferation has high concordance in policies and treaties, making the norm very robust. The NPT is a cornerstone of global cooperation against nuclear proliferation, with near-universal acceptance, from 191 UN members, creating a robust legal framework against nuclear proliferation. In addition to the NPT, UNSC Resolution 1540 further solidified efforts against proliferation by mandating member states to establish legal measures against the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The nuclear nonproliferation regime encompasses various formal agreements, institutions, and informal groupings beyond the NPT and UNSC resolution. These elements — including nuclear-weapon-free zones (NWFZ), institutions such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and other informal efforts (e.g., the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Zanger Committee, the four Nuclear Security Summits, the Six-Party Talks, and the Creating an Environment for Nuclear Disarmament initiative) — contribute to the strengthening of the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope and number of institutions and groupings committed to nuclear nonproliferation signal a widespread third-party response to violations. Breaches of the norm prohibiting nuclear proliferation have prompted robust responses from numerous actors, eliciting international condemnation, economic sanctions, and diplomatic isolation. Whether from individual state actors, alliances such as the European Union, or the UNSC, there is a historical precedent of condemning norm violations by would-be proliferators. The UNSC Sanctions Committee on North Korea, for example, was created in 2006 to address North Korea’s nuclear testing and proliferation activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With high acceptance rates, compliance with the norm against nuclear proliferation is nearly universal. The IAEA, through comprehensive safeguards agreements and the Additional Protocol, plays a crucial role in verifying compliance. For instance, the agency conducted numerous inspections in Iran to ensure adherence to its nuclear obligations. Regional organizations also ensure adherence to specific treaties, emphasizing the multilevel implementation of the norm. For example, the compliance with the obligations of the Treaty of Tlatelolco is ensured by the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the African Commission on Nuclear Energy ensures the implementation of the Treaty of Pelindaba. Overall, the norm against nuclear proliferation exhibits high robustness due to its concordance, reactions to violations, and effective implementation mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, today the nonproliferation norm faces challenges from various actors. Iran’s nuclear program poses a major provocation, and while Iran claims that its activities are intended for peaceful purposes, Western nations and international organizations have raised concerns about the intent and extent of its nuclear endeavors. Similarly, North Korea’s withdrawal from the NPT in 2003 and its development of nuclear weapons have been an ongoing challenge to the nonproliferation norm. Efforts to negotiate and redefine norms related to nuclear proliferation on the Korean Peninsula continue amid diplomatic tensions. Additionally, in March 2024, Russia vetoed the mandate of a UN Panel of Experts tasked with monitoring enforcement of the sanctions regime against North Korea. This not only weakens the implementation of the norm but also suggests a weakening in third-party responses to norm violation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Overall, the norm against nuclear proliferation exhibits high robustness due to its concordance, reactions to violations, and effective implementation mechanisms.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But potential challenges to the nonproliferation norm are also coming from new directions. Given the threat from North Korea’s nuclear program, South Korea may contest the norm against nuclear proliferation, although the likelihood of this is hard to measure. However, polling data shows a gap in public and elite opinions on the issue of South Korea developing an independent nuclear program. A majority (71 percent) of the South Korean public supports an independent nuclear deterrent, while only one-third of the elite supports it (34 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Middle East, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has stated that if Iran did successfully develop a weapon, Saudia Arabia “will have to get one.” Of course, Iran’s ongoing nuclear program itself challenges the nonproliferation norm. While officially endorsing the NPT, concerns persist about Saudi Arabia’s potential interest in developing its nuclear capabilities, posing challenges to existing norms. Saudi Arabia pursuing a nuclear program would hold serious implications for regional stability and the integrity of nonproliferation efforts. Whether or not South Korea, Saudia Arabia, or other states pursue an independent nuclear weapons program will depend not only on regional security dynamics but also on the restraining power of institutions such as the NPT. At present, it is hard to imagine that South Korea, for example, would be the second state to withdraw from the NPT after North Korea. However, if the normative power of the NPT or other nuclear institutions weakens over time, that restraining power may diminish as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nonuse&quot;&gt;Nonuse&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, there is high concordance with the norm of nonuse, yet there are fewer legal mechanisms to enforce this norm compared to nonproliferation. While the NPT — the primary treaty for nonproliferation — does not explicitly prohibit nuclear use, norms regulating potential nuclear use (or nonuse) are directly and indirectly addressed through international humanitarian law. However, international humanitarian law refers to the use of force more broadly, rather than nuclear use specifically. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) explicitly refers to the prohibition of nuclear use, but the treaty is not universally accepted. Despite some reservations, the ratification of NWFZs contributes to increasing concordance regionally. For example, a basic party obligation in the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia is “not to allow in its territory: the production, acquisition, stationing, storage or use, of any nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Generally, there is high concordance with the norm of nonuse, yet there are fewer legal mechanisms to enforce this norm compared to nonproliferation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third-party reactions&lt;/strong&gt; to the use of nuclear weapons have been strong. Acting and former UN secretary-generals António Guterres and Kofi Annan both called out the U.S. atomic bombings of Japan in 1945 as a moment of unmatched horror for humanity. Reactions to the threat of use, however, have been fairly mixed, with condemnation by many Western states, but overall the responses have not been universal. Guterres told the UNSC in March 2024 that “nuclear saber-rattling must stop [and] threats to use nuclear weapons in any capacity are unacceptable.” Steen Hansen, minister counsellor of the European Union, similarly condemned Russian threats as dangerous and unacceptable. But many other international actors have remained largely silent about Russian nuclear threats amid the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third-party actors, including civil society groups and human rights organizations, bolster norm robustness by condemning nuclear use and emphasizing humanitarian and environmental effects. This ranges from the Hibakusha — people affected by the atomic bombings of Japan — to scientific groups such as the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. For example, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons issued a statement in 2022 condemning “nuclear threats [as] unacceptable at any time, by anyone. Putin’s threats increase the risk of escalation to a nuclear conflict.” In 2023, Chinese president Xi Jinping emphasized the need for the international community to “jointly oppose the use of, or threats to use, nuclear weapons.” But not all actors were swift to condemn Russia’s nuclear saber-rattling. The first TPNW Meeting of States Parties, for example, failed to call out Russian nuclear threats, despite the treaty explicitly prohibiting the use and threat of use of nuclear weapons. Some nations with close economic or security ties to Russia, particularly in Central Asia, were hesitant to openly criticize Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compliance&lt;/strong&gt; with the norm is nearly universal, with few actors showing behavior that would suggest an intent to break the nearly 80-year tradition of nuclear nonuse. States have largely been dissuaded from using nuclear weapons in conflicts since the first use of atomic weapons in 1945. While nonuse has persisted, there have been nuclear threats. The United States and the Soviet Union issued nuclear threats during the Berlin Crisis (1958–61) and Cuban Missile Crisis (1962), North Korea has threatened South Korea and its allies multiple times over recent decades, and India and Pakistan have made veiled threats against each other in the past. More recently, nuclear threats have been an integral part of Putin’s strategy for deterring Western intervention in the ongoing war in Ukraine. In February 2024, for example, Putin stated that Western nations “must realise that we also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory.” The extent to which these threats have the potential to lower the threshold for nuclear use remains unclear, but they should not be discounted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation&lt;/strong&gt; of the norm occurs at various levels, with regional enforcement through NWFZ agreements indicating high implementation — with the caveat that countries in NWFZs cannot use or threaten to use nuclear weapons and none of these states possess nuclear weapons. NWFZs are an example of the interconnectedness of the nuclear norms, with some institutions and actors encompassing all three nuclear norms. Some states include the norm against nuclear use in their domestic nuclear strategy through declared no-first-use policies, adding a level of implementation. Other domestic efforts such as law of war manuals subject nuclear use to the principles of proportionality and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;no-testing&quot;&gt;No Testing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concordance&lt;/strong&gt; with the norm against nuclear testing is captured primarily in legal mechanisms such as the PTBT and CTBT. While the CTBT is considered the cornerstone of efforts to halt global nuclear testing, it has not yet entered into force due to reluctance by a key group of states to ratify or sign the treaty. Nevertheless, nuclear possessors, with the exception of North Korea, continue to refrain from nuclear testing. Although a significant number of countries have ratified the treaty, the absence of universal participation from nuclear states could diminish the robustness of concordance with the norm, according to the analytical framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violations of the norm have elicited strong &lt;strong&gt;third-party reactions&lt;/strong&gt; in recent years, including international condemnation and sanctions by individual states as well as the European Union and the UNSC. Civil society efforts by affected communities and organizations have also played a significant role in condemning nuclear testing, resulting in legislative measures such as the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act in the United States. Strong reactions are nearly universal and occur at various levels. For example, the UNSC has passed nearly a dozen sanctions on North Korea since 2006 because of the state’s nuclear program. This includes sanctions on military and arms trade, along with impacts on the financial assets of key individuals, in response to nuclear testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the norm against nuclear testing taking hold with the end of the Cold War, a handful of states have continued testing to develop their nuclear weapons programs. There have been 10 nuclear tests since the CTBT opened for signature in 1996: two by India (1998), two by Pakistan (1998), and six by North Korea (2006, 2009, 2013, two in 2016, and 2017). Compliance has been widespread over the past 30 years, although there have been concerns about low-yield testing, particularly by Russia, such as those raised by the U.S. State Department’s annual compliance report. Thus, while the nonproliferation norm is supported by an active treaty and the nuclear nonuse norm lacks a universally accepted treaty, the nuclear testing norm is upheld by a treaty that is not yet in force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While the nonproliferation norm is supported by an active treaty and the nuclear nonuse norm lacks a universally accepted treaty, the nuclear testing norm is upheld by a treaty that is not yet in force.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation&lt;/strong&gt; of the norm involves various verification methods, including monitoring stations and radionuclide laboratories operated by CTBT signatories. The treaty relies on data from monitoring stations around the world, which is collected and analyzed by the International Data Center. While all signatories have access to this data, only countries that have ratified the treaty are considered full participants. Regional enforcement mechanisms, such as those embedded in NWFZs, signal a high level of implementation in specific regional zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and the United States have engaged in extensive discussions regarding the interpretation of the CTBT. Although both countries have signed the treaty, they hold differing views on what constitutes a violation, illustrating applicatory contestation as they negotiate the scope and interpretation of the norm against nuclear testing. A key point of contention is the concept of zero-yield testing. The CTBT bans all nuclear explosions, but some argue that explosions with an immeasurably small yield are not truly nuclear tests and should be permissible. Putin’s remarks in October 2023 about Russia’s possible readiness to resume nuclear testing reflect this ongoing debate: “I am not ready to tell you right now whether we need or do not need to carry out these tests.” He framed Russia’s potential return to testing as contingent on whether the United States tests. Additionally, some officials in the Trump administration suggested that a return to nuclear testing might be an option. Most recent, Robert C. O’Brien, former national security adviser to Trump, reiterated this need to “test new nuclear weapons for reliability and safety.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like others, the norm against nuclear testing is being contested by a small group of nuclear possessors. North Korea continues to defy the norm by testing or threatening to test nuclear weapons and their means of delivery. Despite international condemnation, Pyongyang argues that such tests are vital for its defensive capabilities. A public statement accompanying one of its 2016 tests emphasized North Korea’s right to self-defense and its intention to bolster its nuclear force against perceived threats, particularly from the United States. Additionally, Russia’s deratification of the CTBT in 2023 and Putin’s suggestion that Russia could return to testing also have the potential to undermine the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;avoiding-a-reverse-normative-cascade&quot;&gt;Avoiding a Reverse Normative Cascade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The normative framework presents both a positive but also a cautionary tale. Overall, the nuclear norms remain strong and are widely observed, despite contestation by a small group of actors and a worsening security environment. They are buttressed by widespread concordance with treaties and agreements, particularly the NPT and regional initiatives, such as NWFZs. And yet, despite the historical resilience and overall robustness of these norms, they face ongoing challenges and adaptations. The nonuse norm, for example, demonstrates considerable resilience and is widely recognized as “taboo.” And yet it is being contested by continued Russian and North Korean nuclear threats — some of which do not receive widespread international condemnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify, this paper’s intention is not to present an overly optimistic perspective, but rather to offer a word of caution. The network of nuclear norms could either be reinforced as a lasting foundation of nuclear order or it could collapse like a house of cards. The interconnected nature of nuclear norms is both their strength and their vulnerability when faced with concerted and persistent contestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The network of nuclear norms could either be reinforced as a lasting foundation of nuclear order or it could collapse like a house of cards. The interconnected nature of nuclear norms is both their strength and their vulnerability when faced with concerted and persistent contestation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key question from the analysis is who creates, upholds, and challenges norms. Norm establishment, to include normative cascades, typically requires norm entrepreneurs or key stakeholders that can build domestic and international consensus. Similarly, norm contestation also begins with individuals; the inverse of entrepreneurs are norm contesters. When it comes to nuclear decisionmaking, particularly in authoritarian countries such as North Korea, Iran, Russia, and China, individual leaders play an outsized role. Russia’s threats of nuclear use in the war in Ukraine have been seemingly driven by Putin. North Korea’s nuclear program is driven by Kim Jong-un and has been personalized to the Kim family. This finding aligns with other scholarship pointing to the importance of individuals in international security. Solingen, among others, has found that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . . systematic differences in nuclear behavior can be observed between states whose leaders or ruling coalitions advocate integration in the global economy, and those whose leaders reject it. . . . Conversely, leaders and ruling coalitions rejecting internationalization incur fewer such costs and have greater incentives to exploit nuclear weapons as tools in nationalist platforms of political competition and for staying in power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the normative framework and the present analysis, this report draws four main conclusions about the health of nuclear norms and the strength of the existing nuclear order. It then offers three sets of recommendations for strengthening nuclear norms, grouped by who should execute them: (1) nuclear possessors, including those in the P5 process (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States); (2) the P3 (France, the United Kingdom, and the United States); and (3) nuclear non-possessors, which includes civil society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;findings&quot;&gt;Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding 1: Nuclear norms are interdependent, and a normative cascade can go both ways.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While nuclear norms continue to benefit from widespread international support, particularly in comparison to other international norms, all three are being tested concurrently. This contestation reflects states’ responses to a dynamic and uncertain geopolitical and technological landscape. While the norms are often represented as stand-alone pillars, these pillars are arranged like dominoes: if one falls, another could follow. Norm development is often portrayed as a cascade, but this cascade could also work in reverse if one norm is significantly weakened.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On the one hand, this interconnectedness could contribute to strengthening norms. Third-party responses and compliance could speak to multiple norms at once. For example, the NWFZs contribute to strengthening all three norms. On the other hand, one norm’s breakdown could undermine the others. Proliferation, for example, has historically been followed by testing, and it could undermine the credibility of not only the NPT and CTBT but also their associated norms. Similarly, any use of a nuclear weapon would be a game changer and could call into question the entire nuclear order and its ability to restrain nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding 2: Norm cascades or reverse cascades are exacerbated by regional dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Norm contestation appears particularly linked to regional issues. For example, Russia’s suspension of arms control agreements, such as New START, correlates with its invasion of Ukraine. Similarly, Russia’s nuclear saber-rattling, which has the potential to undermine the norm against nuclear use, is tied to its illegal invasion of Ukraine. Early on, Putin blamed the United States and NATO for its overreach and expansion in Europe: “What the United States is doing in Ukraine is at our doorstep. . . . And they should understand that we have nowhere further to retreat to. Under [U.S.] protection, they are arming and urging on extremists from a neighbouring country at Russia.” For the Middle East, Saudi Arabia’s threat to pursue nuclear weapons is explicitly tied to regional proliferation and stability, namely whether or not Iran develops nuclear weapons. Similarly, in South Asia, violations are tied to the tensions between India and Pakistan. In response to India’s two nuclear tests in 1998, Pakistan announced its own tests only a few days later. States’ decisions to observe norms, therefore, depend not only on the wider international security environment, but particularly on the regional security environment and perceptions of threats from neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding 3: The norm against nuclear testing is strong, but the weakest of the three.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The analytical framework indicates that the norm against nuclear testing is currently facing the most active contestation from multiple directions. The most recent violation of any of the three norms occurred due to North Korea’s 2017 test, not to mention its ongoing threats to test again, which all challenge the norm against testing. In 2022, for example, South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol indicated that North Korea had completed preparations for a seventh nuclear test. One positive trend in the norm against testing has been the strong response to North Korea’s most recent nuclear tests, particularly by China. This is an important development compared to earlier nuclear tests; however, given Pyongyang and Moscow’s growing closeness, a future test may not receive consensus or UNSC condemnation. Senior officials from Russia and North Korea are meeting regularly to enhance collaboration across various domains such as the economy, science and technology, and culture. In September 2023, for example, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un traveled to Russia’s Far East to promote military and technological links with Russia. Only a few months later, in June 2024, President Putin made his way to North Korea, likely deepening the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Given Pyongyang and Moscow’s growing closeness, a future test may not receive consensus or UNSC condemnation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another challenge is coming from contestation of the CTBT. One point of contestation is the treaty’s delayed entry into force, which remains a distant and unlikely prospect both because of the security environment and because of domestic political polarization, particularly within the United States. The CTBT is also contested by Russia’s deratification. Amid the increasing tensions in the international order, some nuclear-armed states may propose alternative normative frameworks prioritizing national sovereignty over disarmament efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding 4: Treating nuclear possessors as a monolith could undermine nuclear norms.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While this analysis points to a small group of norm contesters, many international actors treat all nuclear possessors as norm contesters because of nuclear modernization programs and continued reliance on nuclear weapons for deterrence. Overall, third-party responses have been strongly supportive of upholding all three norms; however, responses to potential nuclear use and nuclear threats have been less strong than the other two norms. The obvious example of this is the muted international response to Russia’s threats of nuclear use related to Ukraine. While Western leaders, including NATO, explicitly and publicly called out Russian saber-rattling, for example, in the fall of 2022, others were more subdued in their responses. It is believed that Chinese and Indian leaders privately signaled to Putin to de-escalate tensions and nuclear threats in the fall of 2022, but the lack of public outcry does little to strengthen the norms. China and India can take on a more influential role in messaging to Putin the risk that his nuclear threats incur.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these findings, the paper offers three sets of policy recommendations for nuclear possessors and nonpossessors to strengthen existing norms and their associated institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recommendation Set 1: Nuclear Possessors and the P5 Process&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;First and foremost, nuclear possessors should continue to observe and uphold the three nuclear norms. This may be more complicated than it appears. For example, a historically successful tool of nonproliferation has been extended nuclear deterrence to allies and partners, which could require strong nuclear deterrence signaling. Francis Gavin points to NATO as an efficient example of this strategy. Another complication is the fine line between threatening nuclear use — which could undermine the norm against use — and policies of nuclear deterrence which hold at risk what an adversary values to prevent escalation. To reconcile these challenges, nuclear possessors, particularly the United States and United Kingdom, can be more explicit about the historical nonproliferation benefits of extended nuclear deterrence. Additionally, states should refrain from explicit nuclear threats or escalatory language, such as threatening “World War III.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In addition to unilateral restraint and policies, nuclear possessors can also work collectively to uphold and strengthen nuclear norms through forums such as the P5 process as well as the Creating an Environment for Nuclear Disarmament (CEND) and Irreversible Nuclear Disarmament (IND) initiatives. The P5 process is under pressure because of tension in the security environment, but it remains one of the best opportunities for reinforcing norms and reducing risk. Some recent proposals would contribute to strengthening norms against use and testing, such as reciprocal visits to former test sites, a joint statement on a continued testing moratorium, and transparency of doctrines and risk reduction efforts to avoid escalation to nuclear use. The CEND initiative continues to hold plenary meetings, including subgroup work on emerging technologies and risk reduction. One potential area of work would be for CEND participants to identify how emerging technologies, such as additive manufacturing, could undermine norms of nonproliferation. Likewise, the IND initiative is an important opportunity to explore the role of norms in making progress toward political, legal, and technical mechanisms to facilitate irreversible nuclear disarmament.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recommendation Set 2: France, the United Kingdom, and the United States (P3)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Nuclear possessors have unique responsibilities. Ideally, the P5 would act in concert in fulfilling those responsibilities by jointly pursuing many of these opportunities to strengthen nuclear norms. In the absence of P5 unity and consensus, however, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States might lead efforts to pursue these actions. Other opportunities include leading in CEND, IND, and new risk reduction efforts, such as inviting other NWS to join a “human-in-the-loop” commitment in nuclear decisionmaking. There are challenges and risks with this approach. The biggest risk is breaking the P5 process. Undermining the P5 process at a time when the NPT is under pressure could be dangerous. If the P5 process fails to yield substantive results in disarmament, arms control, risk reduction, and transparency, this would be met with deep dissatisfaction by many NNWS and continue to exacerbate polarization within the NPT while inhibiting its ability to serve as a foundation for the nuclear order.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another area of opportunity for the P3 is to engage, either bilaterally or multilaterally, with members of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates) and NNWS to work cooperatively to strengthen nuclear norms. This can include engaging with groupings to better understand risks to nuclear norms at the regional level, along with building consensus around norms against the use and threat of use of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recommendation Set 3: Non-Nuclear Possessors and Civil Society&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;States without nuclear weapons also have responsibilities for upholding nuclear norms, and this paper has demonstrated the importance of third-party responses in contributing to the health of nuclear norms — NWFZs, for example, have a cross-cutting effect on strengthening nuclear norms. But one specific area where NNWS and civil society can strengthen nuclear norms is to avoid treating nuclear possessors as a monolith. All NNWS, including in the context of the NPT review cycle, should call out norm-contesting behavior, such as nuclear threats and withdrawal from existing arms control agreements. These statements can be directed at various members of the P5 process, but they should be specific. They should also continue to pressure the P5 to continue with their dialogues and to address the risks of weakening norms in the context of emerging technologies, transparency of doctrine, and risk reduction initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One area ripe for NNWS and civil society to increase pressure on nuclear possessors and upholding norms is around fissile material. These groups often criticize the Conference on Disarmament (CD) for failing to make progress in recent years, such as progress toward a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty (FMCT). This approach, however, treats all CD members as the same, whereas lack of progress on an FMCT can be explicitly linked to two specific states: Pakistan and China. Pakistan continues to ask for a verifiable FMCT that addresses existing stockpiles of fissile material, not just future production, and China emphasizes the need for prioritizing disarmament by NWS, along with issues around verification. These concerns are understandable and grounds for dialogue, but they should not completely derail FMCT efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;One area ripe for NNWS and civil society to increase pressure on nuclear possessors and upholding norms is around fissile material.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NNWS can also play an important role in enforcing the CTBT. By ratifying the CTBT, they contribute to its global legitimacy and pressure NWS to comply. They can engage in diplomatic efforts to advocate for the treaty’s universal adoption and implementation. Additionally, NNWS can increasingly participate in the CTBT’s verification regime, providing data and support to the International Monitoring System, which enhances the treaty’s enforcement and helps detect and call out any illicit nuclear tests in these regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-call-for-action&quot;&gt;A Call for Action&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the current geopolitical climate, there are still positive developments in the nuclear norm landscape worth noting. No new nuclear states have emerged in two decades, and President John F. Kennedy’s fear of dozens of nuclear possessors has not come to fruition. Nuclear weapons have not been used in conflict since 1945. And while North Korea remains the only country continuing to test nuclear weapons, it has been widely condemned as an international pariah as a result. Overall, nuclear norms are healthy — for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three norms are being actively contested amid a worsening geopolitical landscape. For this reason, policymakers should not be complacent about the health of the nuclear order, thinking that it is safe while underpinned by these norms. Instead, they should consider the interconnectedness of nuclear norms, as emphasized in this paper. With the possibility of a reverse normative cascade on the table, where the weakening of one norm could have ripple effects on others and potentially topple the nuclear landscape as it exists today, the risk is too great for policymakers to do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is ubiquitous in modern defence: space capabilities are essential in areas such as gathering intelligence, enabling navigation and precision firepower via GPS, and communicating beyond the line of sight. Furthermore, the utility of space increasingly renders capabilities a target for hostile action. Attacks on space-enabled communications services, as seen during the war in Ukraine, are just one example of how counter-space capabilities are already being used. In the future, adversaries may not restrict themselves to non-kinetic means, and space itself might turn into a battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK defence views space as both a domain and an enabler, although the balance is skewed towards enablement. It follows that the space domain must be protected to guarantee its utility as an enabler. The mixed message about space given to the services is part of the reason why space is perceived as complicated – it is used by all the armed forces, yet its potential for supporting other domains is not fully understood. A wider understanding of the services and support that space can offer is needed across defence – what it enables, what capabilities are dependent on it, what new vulnerabilities have been exposed as a result, and what investments may be needed to optimise its use. This understanding is important for ensuring that space can continue to be used even when its capabilities are under attack, and so that reversionary non-space-dependent alternatives are developed and trained for, where necessary. UK Space Command will be vital for providing the broader education and wider promotion of space needed across UK defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current approach of treating space as a niche subject area is not only conceptually flawed but also risks leaving space-enabled capabilities vulnerable and space services under-utilised, and reducing the capacity of a growing Space Command to perform its role effectively. This approach has already led to compromises in relation to the Skynet programme that could undermine the security of space assets. In the coming years it will be vital to include UK Space Command in all appropriate discussions to ensure full protection of UK space assets and to allow the command to grow and establish itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper argues that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence and Space Command should emphasise doctrinally that space must be understood as both a domain and an enabler, while acknowledging that currently UK defence uses space capabilities more heavily in the enabler role for terrestrial operations than for defensive or offensive operations in space itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There should be a greater emphasis across the services on education about space capabilities, the degree to which terrestrial systems and concepts of operation rely on them, and the potential vulnerabilities created that must be mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This education effort should be part of a wider promotion of the message that space is not reserved for a few specialists in Space Command and in space programmes, but instead is critical for all the services. As such, space must be widely understood, used, built into operational planning as a key capability across domains, and protected.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is increasingly recognised by UK government as a vital part of defence. It featured prominently in the UK Integrated Review in 2021, and this was followed by the release of three strategy documents: the National Space Strategy in 2021; the Defence Space Strategy in 2022; and the Space Power Doctrine in 2022. The focus on integration – highlighted in both the 2023 Integrated Review Refresh and the associated Defence Command Paper – is intended to counter the new threat environment and is meant to “[enable] the UK to deliver disproportionate effect relative to [its] size”. Space acts a critical enabler for this integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is also the recognition that space and the cyber and electromagnetic activities that underpin capabilities “are the least understood domains in UK Defence”. This lack of understanding and lack of priority status is also reflected in budgets: in 2022, a mere £1.4 billion was promised for space capabilities over the following 10 years, apart from the £5 billion to be spent on the UK’s Skynet Programme. Meanwhile, the UK spent £52.8 billion in total on defence in 2022/23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it appears that government has started to take space more seriously, as shown by the publication of two strategies, a more general understanding of how space enables many defence functions remains absent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space Power Doctrine 2022 document goes into greater detail, outlining how space capabilities should contribute to UK defence’s integrated approach. It also highlights (to an extent) where space already supports and enables capabilities, and explains the current responsibilities and organisations involved in the defence space structures. UK space doctrine states that “the vast majority of military operations could not be sustained without space capabilities”, and space is often referred to as forming part of the “Defence Digital Backbone”. Essentially, space allows defence to know where its own forces are (Positioning, Navigation and Timing [PNT], linked to situational awareness applications), and to know where adversaries and associated threats might be (earth observation/ISR), and it enables satellite communication channels that are vital for command and control (C2) purposes (SATCOM). Space assets are critical to enabling the use of long-range precision weapons for strikes in high-threat areas through the provision of ISR data for targeting, PNT services for guidance and navigation, and SATCOM links for C2 functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the UK’s space doctrine deals with explaining what space is, including descriptions of space debris and solar weather. This is necessary to some extent, as it is the UK’s first dedicated space doctrine (previously it was part of airpower doctrine), and one of its aims is “to provide a basis of understanding”. However, this concentration on the basics of space as an environment means that details on how space enables terrestrial capabilities are relatively thin on the ground, and cannot educate readers on terrestrial alternatives or how outages should be dealt with . To make up for this missed opportunity, later iterations of strategy/documentation will need to expand further on how space is used to enable practical military effects. One way to do this, while not losing sight of the basics, could be to update the UK Military Space Primer from 2010 and point towards that document in future updated doctrine documents. This would leave more room in the updated doctrine for information that would help readers appreciate the operational potential of space. It would further promote debate on the subject and help potential beneficiaries engage better with the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem is not unique to the UK. Jeffrey Caton has commented that current US space and cyberspace doctrines “often devolve to technical descriptions of their operation”. One of the core purposes of doctrine is to provide “a common basis for understanding the nature and conduct of armed conflict”, but initial theorising can end up taking this more technical approach, as understanding of the potential of space capability to support and enhance military activity has started to permeate to the tactical level but has not yet systematically reached the operational level. Some analysts have argued that doctrine tends to be developed on the basis of practical experience in a given domain or in the context of new tactics, rather than being seen as a prerequisite for practical success, as encapsulated in the phrase “doctrine is the daughter of history”. In the same vein, while systematic thinking about the air domain developed rapidly during the First World War, the RAF was already well established before a unified body of UK airpower doctrine was written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;purpose&quot;&gt;PURPOSE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is currently missing from discussions is an assessment of how decision-makers within the UK defence and security community view space, how this thinking has shaped nascent defence space infrastructures, and how the various structures involved affect the future trajectory of using the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this paper is to outline how UK defence can use space to its fullest extent. Although Space Command was created as recently as 2021, this does not mean that space is a new concept in the UK: rather, space capabilities have formed a little-acknowledged part of UK defence capabilities for decades. With space rising to prominence again around the latter half of the 2010s – evidenced by the establishment of space commands and accompanying strategies and documents in several states – a change in perception is overdue. Space needs to be understood at every level of UK defence, and by policymakers and practitioners alike. This paper outlines how this understanding can be achieved – with education and promotion through Space Command. This perception shift would help the command to fulfil its task of protecting space as a domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is primarily aimed at UK defence personnel: both those who are already familiar with space and those who are not. While the information about the threats to space capabilities will not be news to some, the message about education and promotion needs to be heard by all. Meanwhile, the rest of defence needs to hear the message that space is essential to modern conflict at all levels of intensity, and that it is not a specialised area for a few select experts, but rather one that has capabilities and vulnerabilities that need to be understood by all defence professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;METHODOLOGY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper is based in part on a review of academic literature and extant military doctrine, but it also draws on 15 interviews with experts conducted by the author between October 2022 and August 2023. The interviewees include current senior serving members of the armed forces, academics, and experienced people working in the commercial space sector, selected for their expertise. Most interviews took place online, with two interviews conducted in person and one via phone call. All interview data has been anonymised. Given the paper’s focus on UK defence space, most of the experts interviewed are based in the UK, with only one interviewee based in the US. The UK experience, however, is not unique among relatively new space powers, and some lessons may also be applicable to similarly sized space powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;STRUCTURE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper consists of two main sections. The first section illustrates how space is currently conceived of as both a domain and an enabler, with the current skew towards it primarily acting as an enabler. This may yet change (for example, if on-orbit activities and threats to space assets increase), and the paper uses analogies from the early days of the RAF to showcase this. As interviews revealed, space is often misunderstood, if it is considered at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second section deals with the implications of these current patterns of thinking. The section argues that space is of vital importance for UK defence, and that it is currently not given the prominence and consideration that it should be across the wider armed forces. It also argues that space education across the UK armed forces is vital to understanding: how space already supports operations as a critical enabler; its vulnerabilities; and potential non-space alternatives that might be required to sustain operations if space assets are disrupted or altogether unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, it becomes clear that Space Command must be structured to ensure that the UK’s space capability will flourish – both as an enabler of other domains, through services like PNT, ISR and communications, and in terms of enabling it to fulfil its core role, the protection and defence of space assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-conception-of-space-within-the-military&quot;&gt;THE CONCEPTION OF SPACE WITHIN THE MILITARY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand space as part of the UK defence framework, it is important to understand how it is thought of in defence decision-making circles. Space has been physically explored for the better part of the past seven decades. However, the thinking around how it can be used for military purposes, and how it should be conceptualised as part of an integrated force, lags behind thinking related to the traditional domains and to cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK space power doctrine considers space a domain, applying NATO’s doctrine that it is an operational domain alongside land, air, maritime, and electromagnetic and cyber. Space is currently conceived of within the Ministry of Defence (MoD) as an “independent operational domain” which enables a whole host of capabilities. This seems consistent with both UK and NATO doctrine – after all, space is a physical environment that can be entered, and in which operations can take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the term “domain” is itself contested, it is commonly defined as “a sphere of the operating environment that has physical characteristics requiring unique doctrines, organizations, and equipment for military forces to effectively control and exploit in the conduct of military operations”. This is the case for space: the physical characteristics of the environment require a unique approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laws of physics as they apply in space, the associated speed of travel, and the remoteness of the environment are just a few of the initial factors that need to be considered when operating in space, and they have implications for deployment and maintenance. For example, assets deployed in space, in addition to inherently requiring special design features, also need to cope with the fact that maintenance in space is generally not possible. While in-orbit refuelling, repair and even manufacturing are developing areas of the space industry, they are still far from routine. For the moment at least, a satellite’s lifespan is dictated by its fuel supply. For assets in geostationary orbit this is typically 15 years, although the lifetime of many satellites is stretched out for longer. Space is also different from other domains in that its defence assets are not crewed; the phrase “satellites don’t have mothers” echoes discussions in other domains around the use of UAVs and other remotely operated capabilities, in relation to concerns that the loss of hardware is not considered enough of a deterrent, thereby potentially lowering the threshold of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the uniqueness of the environment requires targeted thinking that accounts for the specific characteristics of space as a domain. The conceptualisation of space as a domain also carries with it structural, administrative and budgetary recognition. It could even be argued that the categorisation of space as a separate domain was an important part of the justification for the establishment of UK Space Command as a joint two-star headquarters under the RAF in 2021. The primary task of Space Command, which is the protection and defence of space assets, reflects this categorisation as a separate domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the establishment of Space Command may also send an unhelpful signal to the rest of defence: that space is “taken care of” and is a niche topic that only concerns those working in the command itself. That space is sometimes forgotten about was confirmed by a group captain in the MoD Space Policy team, who stated that space sometimes falls down the priority list for funding, as it is primarily regarded as an enabler for other activities. This highlights why further education and promotion among the rest of the services is a crucial task for Space Command in the coming years, so as to firmly establish the importance of space, its ubiquity in UK defence, and the overall dependence on the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, viewing space from a domain-centric perspective can also be unhelpful, and viewing space solely in this way limits understanding of how it can influence military operations. As a senior military officer at UK Space Command put it, “we might not win a war using only space, but we will not win a war without it”. The three main roles of space – PNT, ISR and SATCOM – are fundamentally important because they support other, terrestrial, capabilities. Most of the capabilities that space unlocks and enables do not exist in isolation but rather are used as part of wider operational or tactical systems. However, sometimes military users are wholly reliant on SATCOM, especially on early entry deployments or where the ranges or terrain prevent the deployment of terrestrial networks. For example, SATCOM played a vital role for Western forces in Afghanistan, where it was often the only viable communications option for deployed bases or patrols. Space is vital for connectivity in multi-domain settings, for example allowing naval forces to communicate in real time with higher headquarters and ground forces ashore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-balance-between-domain-and-enabler&quot;&gt;THE BALANCE BETWEEN DOMAIN AND ENABLER&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within UK defence circles, space has been treated more as an enabler than as an operational domain (although this attitude may not last). John Klein put it succinctly: “The inherent value of space is what it allows you to do”. This perception has structural implications: the conception of space as primarily an enabler might suggest that it should not be an independent command, in view of historical precedent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the RAF became an independent service only in 1918. For most of the First World War, aircraft were thought of – in their reconnaissance and artillery observation roles – as enablers for land and maritime forces. Towards the end of the war, though, the increasing use of aircraft in strategic bombing campaigns to disrupt the enemy’s industrial war efforts prompted a shift in the perceived balance between airpower’s importance as an enabler and as a separate domain of warfare. This shift towards thinking about airpower in domain-centric terms was ultimately reflected in the granting to the RAF of its status as an independent service in the final year of the war. As George K Williams wrote, “[the] issue of strategic bombardment was from the outset inextricably conjoined with the creation of the third service”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the origins of modern air forces may to some extent serve as an analogy for the origins of national space commands, there are important distinctions to be made. Among them is the fact that air-to-ground and air-to-air combat, if only rudimentary, began to take place almost as soon as the air began to be used for military purposes. While physical combat in orbit would be possible, this has not yet occurred. Furthermore, while space is already providing powerful new benefits for states (echoing the way that the air domain proved revolutionary), it does not provide the same initial benefit of comparatively low cost of entry to achieve transformative effects. Operating in space, as we are often reminded by launch failures and long project timelines, is difficult and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The duality of space as both a domain and an enabler is not necessarily permanent, as it may evolve into a domain in which direct acts of war happen. If space warfare were to become a regular feature of conflicts, this would even out the balance between space’s domain/enabler roles. The current imbalance would then shift, leading to space doctrine and concepts changing, just as they did in the air domain. For the moment, considering space as a domain as well as an enabler is necessary for the protection of its assets, as well as for creating the budgetary and structural latitude for space within UK defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the conception of space as both a domain and an enabler is correct but skewed, which further complicates the way in which it is perceived by the rest of defence. Space Command’s official functions are “delivering day-to-day space operations, growing and training defence’s space workforce, and developing and delivering space equipment programmes”. Treating space as a domain is thus central to the role of Space Command in the delivery of space operations, but it is also important in terms of promoting space, educating the wider forces about their dependence on and the utility of space services, and – perhaps most crucially – protecting the domain by looking after the assets within it. In short, the domain must be protected, so that it can also be used as an enabler. This is why it is important to have a dedicated structure for space in the form of a Space Command: effectively, Space Command deals with space as a domain, while the rest of the services treat space as an enabler for their own conventional capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-steps-for-uk-space&quot;&gt;FUTURE STEPS FOR UK SPACE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having discussed how space is currently perceived within UK defence, it is important to consider next steps for UK space, including what Space Command’s role entails. Given the current state of understanding of space discussed above, the priorities for focus can be divided into three distinct categories: education; promotion; and protection of assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-need-for-education-and-promotion&quot;&gt;THE NEED FOR EDUCATION AND PROMOTION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the ubiquitous nature of the space services underpinning many of the conventional capabilities that modern forces depend upon, the services require a broader understanding of space’s contribution to their operations. Space Command’s expertise covers space as a domain, and the threats posed to assets in orbit. While the Command can help with education and promotion, the rest of defence needs to engage more closely and actively improve its baseline knowledge. This includes what kind of disruptions are to be expected, how these can be minimised, and what alternatives are available if satellite services are degraded or fail altogether. As previously outlined, current policy documents – the Space Power Doctrine, the Defence Space Strategy and the National Space Strategy – to some extent explain why space is important, where dependencies lie and what threats to anticipate, but these documents remain rather limited in scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In interviews, concerns were expressed about a degree of myopia among the services; but it was also noted that this might change as thinking about cross-domain integration evolves, with space becoming more prominent in discussions. A senior government official at the MoD remarked that there was “education left to do”, and a “low space IQ across departments”. There was a general consensus among interviewees that more space education was required in defence circles not immediately adjacent to space, with Space Command playing a key role in bridging that gap. The need for education was further emphasised in a House of Commons Defence Committee report in 2023, which also acknowledged that modification and development of training was underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some measures are already being taken to address the issue: the Space Power Doctrine outlines the idea that space is part of an integrated approach, partly enabled and coordinated through a network of space liaison officers. Although this goes some way towards alleviating the problem, the presence of a few space experts scattered around the services is not going to prompt a seismic change in understanding. In fact, the designation of space experts risks sending the wrong message: that space is so complicated that it is the domain solely of specialised experts, rather than an area that concerns everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another vehicle for education is the Space Academy, which is to open at the end of 2024 as part of the UK Defence Academy. Including space as part of wider defence education and situating it naturally among the other domains is the right approach: space forms a crucial part of defence infrastructure and should not be treated as so specialised that it is reserved for a select few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In interviews, one senior RAF officer noted that the problem with attempting to spread knowledge and awareness of space more widely among defence was that content was overly complicated, requiring the topic to be communicated repeatedly. This highlights the need for marketing as well as education: it is not just space’s importance that needs to be communicated, but also that the topic is not as difficult as is sometimes perceived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem could be how the topic is currently explained. Everyday end-users of space services – such as a soldier using a satellite phone – might be familiar with the space-enabled device in their hand, but not with the space threats that could degrade its functionality. Although considering space solely from a domain perspective facilitates the scrutiny of space threats and other important environment-specific topics, it all too often obscures the enabler elements and neglects the tactical level at which space plays a key role in terrestrial activities. The soldier with the satellite phone may not consider themselves to be a space user, despite the degree to which the success of their mission, or even their survival, depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When communicating why space matters, therefore, it might be more fruitful to stress the domain’s potential as an enabler, as well as the number of terrestrial capabilities that could not operate in their current capacity without it. The current deficit of clear communication creates a gap, whereby understanding at the operational level is often lost. This is problematic given that understanding of potential capabilities, vulnerabilities and dependencies is necessary at the operational level to ensure that disruptions to space services do not catch troops off guard, and that reversionary measures can be implemented quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will therefore be Space Command’s fundamental task over the coming years to educate and to spread awareness among the rest of the joint force. Space liaison officers are a good start, but they are not a panacea – space is not a niche topic and ought no longer to be treated as such. It is vital to ensure that space quickly becomes part of defence’s “business as usual” activity so that its importance is more broadly recognised. While space’s unique characteristics affect how it fits into the defence framework, treating it as a specialised, discrete part of defence will hinder full integration and contribute to the perception of space as an overly complicated department with a high barrier to entry. A modern fighting force that is truly integrated cannot function if it is unaware of how one of its main enablers works (or if its fighting force is put off learning about it because the subject matter is considered too complicated). This does not mean that space specialists are unnecessary – in fact, they are very much needed, and well placed within Space Command – but space should not be regarded as a field that only concerns a few specialists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space Command is currently best placed to drive the education and promotion campaign that is necessary if this understanding – that space is everyone’s concern – is to be attained. One of the key requirements will be developing skills associated with education and promotion. Cyber security in the civilian sector provides a useful analogy. Since every company uses the internet to some extent, most companies provide cyber security training for their staff, for example to make them aware of phishing emails and the ways in which their organisation could become vulnerable in the event of a breach. In the same way, every soldier who handles space-enabled equipment (a category that likely includes most service personnel) needs to be aware of the limitations of the tool and the threats to its associated systems. The absence of such awareness risks late detection or incorrect addressing of counter-space measures. Moreover, users need to be acquainted with the backup options available (or at least be aware of the degree of risk if there are no backup options). Although recent combat operations undertaken by the British armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan did not involve significant contests in the electromagnetic spectrum, the experience of the current war in Ukraine suggests that this situation would change in a peer-to-peer (or near-peer) conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-need-for-protection&quot;&gt;THE NEED FOR PROTECTION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of space assets has increasingly led to them being seen as potential targets. Geospatial analytics company Hawkeye 360 has reported that there was “increased GPS interference in and around Ukraine in the months leading up to the February attack as well as since”. Similarly, Elon Musk reported attacks against the mega-constellation Starlink – the space-enabled internet provider that has supplied Ukrainian troops with much-needed connectivity. On the morning of the invasion of Ukraine, another space-enabled internet provider, Viasat, was targeted in a cyber attack, although it is unclear to what extent one of its clients, the Ukrainian Armed Forces, was affected by the resultant outage. What is clear, though, is that adversaries and competitors have realised the utility of space assets, and will endeavour to ensure they are disrupted or made inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is further evidenced by Russia’s focus on information dominance. Space, as one of the major conduits for information flows, is a crucial attack vector. Russian electronic warfare (EW) capabilities did not initially prove as dominant in Ukraine as had been assumed, primarily due to a lack of in-depth Russian planning during the opening phases of the invasion. While Russia’s use of EW capabilities has increased significantly in both scope and sophistication since the opening stages of the war, these have not been particularly successful in denying Ukraine access to satellite-enabled communications, in part due to the resilience of the Starlink constellation. Nevertheless, they are having a negative effect on positioning, thus “slowing down vital kill chains and imposing significant limitations on Ukrainian reconnaissance in depth”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the limited initial use of EW capabilities in Ukraine, it must be assumed that space capabilities, such as SATCOM, would be at least partially disrupted in any future peer-to-peer (or near-peer) conflict. This is important, especially given the ubiquity and utility of the electromagnetic spectrum for C2 purposes, including communications, coordination and targeting. Western forces largely conduct training in environments that are unrealistically permissive from an electromagnetic spectrum perspective. Likewise, most recent Western combat experience has been in expeditionary operations where the space environment has been largely uncontested. For example, whereas SATCOM ground stations could become targets for physical attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan, the satellites and the links themselves were not at risk. In 2003, Iraqi EW systems were present and alleged to have been provided by Russia, but they proved incapable of jamming US systems and were ultimately destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consistent attempts to target space-enabled capabilities in the war in Ukraine are not an outlier. Both Russia and China view Western (and specifically US) dependence on space as a weakness to be exploited. While China and Russia both run significant counter-space programmes, it is not only space powers that are capable of disrupting or destroying space assets. Cyber attacks against space systems and direct attacks/sabotage targeting ground stations are just two ways in which a non-space power could disrupt space systems. Attacks in the electromagnetic spectrum, such as jamming and spoofing, have become part and parcel of modern warfare and could even be carried out by non-state actors, given the widespread commercial availability of jammers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the degree of dependence on space services and the rapidly expanding threat they face, the US Army and the US Air Force have already begun training under GPS-denied conditions – Exercise Red Flag in 2018 was a prominent example. In all NATO countries, services dependent on satellite-enabled services – air forces, armies and navies – should increase reversionary training. In many cases, potential reversionary options already exist for situations where space services are degraded or denied. For example, GPS alternatives for the Royal Navy have been suggested, such as an automated celestial navigation system, magnetic anomaly navigation and bathymetric navigation. Even where one method may not provide a comprehensive service, the combination of alternative navigation methods could offer resilience in scenarios where GPS is disrupted or completely unavailable. In this instance, a primary, alternative, contingency and emergency (PACE)-like approach, as used for communications planning, could prove equally useful for PNT and other space systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, it is inevitable both that space will be a critical enabler in future wars and that space assets will be specifically targeted, given their centrality to modern capabilities. Consequently, understanding of space needs to extend far beyond those immediately responsible for space assets, reaching out across the whole breadth of modern forces. This highlights the necessity of education at a general level in defence about the dependencies and vulnerabilities of systems relying on space assets, alongside appropriate involvement of Space Command in programmes to perform its core task of ensuring that assets are defended against space threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structural-and-organisational-implications-for-protect-and-defend&quot;&gt;STRUCTURAL AND ORGANISATIONAL IMPLICATIONS FOR “PROTECT AND DEFEND”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While UK Space Command is still in its early days, the structures that are being shaped now will be fundamental not only to the command’s success but also to how effectively space can enable wider cross-domain integration. As Bleddyn Bowen puts it, “the primary questions of a space force should be who can manage space infrastructure and its protection best, and which branches of the military should engage in counterspace missions, most often involving terrestrially based weapons”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was inaugurated in 2021, UK Space Command was established under the financial umbrella of the RAF, with its headquarters located in High Wycombe. This was at least in part due to the fact that most suitably qualified and experienced personnel on space issues in defence were deemed to work in the RAF already. At the time, there were discussions about whether the command should sit under Strategic Command, given that it is a joint enabler and essential to integration, and also considering that the Skynet programme, which at approximately £5 billion makes up the vast majority of the UK defence space budget, already falls within its remit. However, the scope of operations, capability development and training, and the fact that almost 70% of the UK Space Command workforce comes from the RAF, led to the command being formed under the RAF. This decision was echoed in the German armed forces (also in 2021), and is in line with several other countries (including France, which created its Air and Space Force in 2020). UK Space Command is not a single service function, however. It is a joint command that acts as the UK’s nerve centre for space, and is staffed by personnel from all three services, although administrative staff and logistical underpinnings are provided by Air Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three questions to be answered in this context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should Space Command be an independent service?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it best placed as a command or headquarters under the auspices of the RAF, as is currently the case?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should it instead be moved to Strategic Command?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is currently not clear whether Space Command will eventually outgrow its parent organisation and become an independent service. For the time being, however, it is too small to function as a standalone service. Leaving aside budget considerations, it is probably wise for Space Command to be made its own service only if exclusive space operations become substantial enough for the enabler/domain balance to tip towards the domain end of the spectrum. As long as space is primarily used as an enabler, it seems most reasonable for the command to fall under one of the more established services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Space Command is not an independent service, then, what is the best way to carve out a nerve centre for space when decisions made by Space Command will affect all the other services? How should capacity and responsibility for different space functions, such as ISR, SATCOM and PNT, be allocated within the services? UK space power doctrine suggests that, where further clarification is required to avoid doubt, a mission should be labelled according to its effect rather than its means. This, however, poses a question about the extent to which it is possible to have exclusively space missions. Space is “a prime integrator” and is very rarely used in isolation. What are operated are assets that send data to ground stations, which in turn assist terrestrial assets – whether by providing images through ISR, coordinates via PNT, or data through SATCOM. Protective measures for satellites would fall squarely in the space mission category, though current anti-satellite measures are most likely to come in the form of jamming, spoofing and cyber attacks – all of which attack the links (and potentially terrestrial elements such as ground stations), rather than directly targeting the space assets themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this suggests that Space Command is probably best placed under Strategic Command at this stage, for two reasons. First, if Space Command is tasked with the protection and defence of space assets against attacks (most of which are likely to take place in the electromagnetic and cyber realms), it would be best placed to work with the command that already owns most of those capabilities. Second, moving away from the top-level budget of the RAF would send a powerful cultural message that space enables the full spectrum of military capabilities and affects everyone, not just aviators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are deep intra-dependencies within each domain, and perhaps especially within space, which acts as the glue that holds the other domains together. Therefore, losing access to the space capabilities that are crucial for achieving operational success might be particularly disruptive for the complex system of interdependencies across the air, land, maritime, cyber and space domains. In interviews, one official stressed that the potential risk of overlap was not unique to space, but happened in other areas as well. This seems to suggest that an overlap of space roles mentioned in the Space Power Doctrine is widespread across defence and is actually a “growing pain” of the continuing trend towards integration. As a former signaller reflected during interviews, the main problem with integration was that people saw it as a destination rather than as a journey that in reality never ends, due to technology change, with no final end state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pervasiveness of space means that there is also a danger of insufficient involvement and consultation of Space Command on projects or systems that concern space. A prime example of where this could be potentially harmful is the Skynet programme, a hardened constellation of X-band satellites that provides all beyond line of sight communications to the UK military. The programme has been running since the late 1960s, and the next generation of satellites is already being planned: Skynet 6A has been promised to provide “more capacity, speed and greater versatility”. The Skynet programme, despite being a critical space asset, falls under Strategic Command, and it is the biggest UK defence space project. While there are long-term ambitions to move the programme to sit under Space Command, there are no immediate plans to do so. However, other new space capabilities being developed, such as the ISR constellation Istari and the integrator system Minerva, are planned to fall within Space Command’s remit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the UK’s biggest defence space project, it may seem counterintuitive that Skynet is not allocated to Space Command. However, given the advanced stage the project had reached by the time that Space Command was being created, and the project’s sheer scale, its placement was a logical decision. A huge project such as Skynet requires a command that can support it with the scale of staffing it needs. As a space industry expert has observed, Space Command is currently not “configured” to take on large projects. Furthermore, there is experience within Strategic Command to help guide how Skynet ought to be run – including how its services can reach the “frontline” when necessary. This is in part enabled through the Chief Information Officer within the MoD, and guided by the Digital Strategy for Defence, ensuring that “frontline forces … have real-time access to data”. Taking Skynet out of these tried-and-tested structures, while attempting to manage such a big project and learning “on the go”, would have been counterproductive, and could have led to the loss of crucial expertise, such as appropriate bandwidth for operations. In the view of a senior military officer at UK Space Command, taking on the Skynet programme at such an early stage of development of the Command would have caused significant issues, given the size of the programme, and would have been all-encompassing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that the inclusion of Skynet under Space Command in the future would not strengthen the command (albeit requiring additional budget and people). Space Command is already responsible for the “protect and defend” element of Skynet – ensuring that it is safe from hostile intent. Moreover, Skynet 6 will be in orbit for many years and will carry out critical mission support, making it a legitimate target for adversaries. Given the evolving nature of space threats and the importance of the service provided, it has become evident that additional protection is needed beyond the measures that were initially specified at the start of the programme. Ultimately, the problem with Skynet has been that, despite the large budget, it would be challenging to meet the requirements of protect and defend from within Skynet’s existing funding. This is because when the requirements were set, the initial threat assessment assumed a different geopolitical situation (and a different risk level for satellites). When Space Command was established, it was relatively late in the process to influence the requirements for Skynet 6A and Enduring Capability, and for agreeing the appropriate balance of responsibility between Space Command and Strategic Command for delivering the protect and defend mission. The case of Skynet is perhaps unique, in the sense that the timing of the establishment of Space Command did not lend itself to sufficient consultation. However, it is an example that shows that the vulnerability and protection of satellites need to be considered more extensively. Where compromises had to be made for the current programme, this has been considered a lesson learned, and significant progress is being made towards understanding how future Skynet spacecraft can be protected and defended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dynamic is not unusual for a defence programme of this scale. Given the long development and deployment timeframes usually involved, security requirements can quickly become outdated. However, in most major defence projects, modifications to hardware and configuration can be made at multiple points during a capability lifecycle to improve responsiveness to evolving threats. Space assets are somewhat unique, in that generally only the software can be updated once an asset has been placed in orbit. Therefore, a greater degree of horizon scanning is required, and software adaptability built in to ensure the ability to protect the asset throughout its lifespan. This is particularly true for satellites in geostationary orbit (like Skynet), which remain in orbit for longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson must be that the protection and defence requirements of any future space asset need to be decided within Space Command and included in the core specifications from the inception of any project. Given that Space Command will ultimately hold operational responsibility for Skynet, the way that the programme has been managed in terms of ownership creates a gap between those who designed the programme and those who will be ultimately responsible for it. This not only increases the potential vulnerability of a strategic asset, due to a lack of focus on protect and defend requirements during development, but also potentially risks a fledgling Space Command looking ineffective in the event of any issues with Skynet 6 Enduring Capability once in service, which could hamper the command’s future development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Skynet programme serves as an example for the wider structure: bigger projects that require a large budget and many personnel are best placed outside Space Command, at least while the command matures, but must involve the command to the extent that it can assure its future mission of protecting and defending space assets once they enter service. In this way, the “domain” thinking sits within Space Command, while the “enabler” elements stay with the relevant parts of the services or UK Strategic Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space will become increasingly contested as the reliance on space-enabled assets grows. It is therefore vital that modern armed forces are ready for this contest – this cannot be done with only a handful of people in a single command recognising the potential dangers. Thus, the setting up of a dedicated Space Command should not send the message to the rest of the force that space is now “taken care of” – space operations do not happen in isolation from other domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK Space Command was formed in 2021. Now, three years after its inception and the publication of the National and Defence Space Strategies, important lessons have been learned. Global trends, not least those observed during the war in Ukraine, have made it abundantly clear that space services are not a niche capability. Space is a ubiquitous and essential integrating layer for modern military operations, and as a result it is also increasingly being directly and indirectly targeted by adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With space underlying so many military capabilities, space knowledge cannot be left to a few specialists in UK defence. Rather, its dependencies and vulnerabilities and non-space-based alternatives need to be widely understood. An understanding of space and what it can do for UK defence and security needs to permeate all of UK defence, and be promoted at every level to guarantee continuous access to space and the capabilities it enables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of a Space Academy at the Defence College is a step in the right direction, as it further drives home the message that space does not require special treatment, as a discrete entity, but is instead vitally integrated into the way that defence operates. Widespread understanding of how space enables modern warfare will be fundamental to early threat detection, the prevention of service disruption and, ultimately, unlocking true integration. It is therefore vital that space education is made a core part of broader military education and training within defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as enabling this wider education, a core role for Space Command in the coming years will be the protection of space capabilities. As space becomes more woven into defence structures, and space capabilities become more resilient (but also dispersed across a wider array of constellations and services), the challenge of protection will become more complex. Space Command needs the tools and the people to counter these threats. This requires involving Space Command from the beginning of projects so that the security of space assets, rather than being an afterthought, is designed in from the start. Space security must be considered at every level, and from the beginning – otherwise a multitude of terrestrial capabilities may become vulnerable or even be rendered ineffective through attacks on the space assets that enable them to function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the concept of space power is gaining importance and visibility across the military, it is now time to engage the wider community of space beneficiaries across UK defence in much greater detail. Space is an enabler for many fundamental capabilities, such as the orbital ISR, PNT and SATCOM that make modern warfare possible. Space is an integrator of many capabilities and functions. It is therefore important to recognise and counter threats to these functions, both from the harsh space environment and from adversaries, who are increasingly investing in tools that make disruption or denial of space-enabled capabilities possible. Thus there is a need for wider education and promotion of space within the armed forces, as well as for potential structural changes to both programme management and service ownership to ensure that Space Command can ultimately fulfil its role of protecting and defending the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;李家田稱以《高達》戰艦作為TG名 控方質疑：打外敵？革命？&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NhQeYDB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（12日）踏入第52日審訊。選擇作供的被告李家田，接受控方大律師周凱靈盤問。李供稱被捕時遭多名警員拳打腳踢，現擔心在庭上說出被打經歷後，「出到去可能仲有啲咩報復性待遇。」但他強調：「驚但係我都仲要講，因為我要畀所有人知道，警察係會點做嘢。同埋我相信法庭可以畀到一個公義我。」控方另問及李的 Telegram 用戶名「I am reinforce Jr.」的意思。李解釋是動畫《高達》其中一部戰艦的名稱，並指自己喜歡《高達》的反戰概念。控方追問戰艦用途，李表示負責打仗。控方再問：「打外敵？革命？」李回答是「幫助國家打外敵」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑李家田未完成儀式非天主教徒-又問為何在基督教學校讀書&quot;&gt;控方質疑李家田未完成儀式非天主教徒 又問為何在基督教學校讀書&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第四被告李家田第五日作供，接受控方代表大律師周凱靈盤問。李作供時以天主教形式宣誓，並曾稱出生後領洗。控方問李有否完成堅振聖事（即嬰兒受洗後，於長大再確認教徒身份的儀式），李表示沒有完成，亦不知道有這個程序。他解釋，兒時曾向母親表示想領聖體，但母親卻回應「大個啲先」。控方遂質疑：「嚴格嚟講，你不能用聖經宣誓？」李表示不知道。控方又問，李是否在基督教學校讀書；他同意。控方質疑學校既然得知李是天主教徒，「人哋照畀你讀書？」李回應：「我唔明有咩問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李擔心說出被打經歷後遭報復性對待-但強調要畀所有人知警察點做嘢&quot;&gt;李擔心說出被打經歷後遭報復性對待 但強調「要畀所有人知警察點做嘢」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李早前稱，2020年6月11日被捕時遭數名警員拳打腳踢及施行「水刑」，導致他在錄影會面期間感驚慌，擔心自己及母親再受類似對待。他今表示，被捕後兩天首次被帶上法庭時，亦感驚慌，而驚慌感覺持續至現在。控方質疑：「你而家喺懲教署，你知道係同警察分開？」李同意。另外，李確認自他被捕後，其母親選擇離港，現已離世。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問為何仍感驚慌，李解釋擔心警察「告我多啲罪」，並指：「我喺庭上面講佢哋點打我之後，擔心出到去可能仲有啲咩報復性待遇。」法官張慧玲問：「你相信即使懲教職員睇住，你都有機會畀警察報復性對待？」李澄清，擔心將來離開懲教署後會受到報復性待遇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官表示不解，並問：「你話驚所以唔講，但係而家你講咗？」李提高聲線回答：「驚但係我都仲要講，因為我要畀所有人知道，警察係會點做嘢。同埋我相信法庭可以畀到一個公義我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李強調無稱毋須看醫生-屬警員自問自答&quot;&gt;李強調無稱毋須看醫生 屬警員「自問自答」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李確認在案件首次提堂時，他由當值律師代表，但因在警方羈押下故沒有投訴。李同意當日他要求8天保釋覆核，於是在6月19日再次上庭，並由朋友協助聘請的私人律師代表。李表示因比較相信私人律師，故透過律師向法庭投訴被毆打、掌摑、打肚、踢腰，以及施行「水刑」。根據紀錄，律師在庭上透露由於已事隔數天，故李身上的瘀傷差不多消退，只剩下腰間有瘀痕，李希望懲教帶他去驗傷及帶他往警察投訴課。控方質疑，李昨供稱被打後只發現腰間有瘀傷；他解釋其意思是瘀傷逐漸消退。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方根據紀錄指出，李表示毋須拍攝傷勢照片。李解釋當時警方問：「使唔使影相？唔使㗎喇！你返去懲教署先啦。」控方再指，李當時稱暫時毋須看醫生，有需要再看。李強調自己沒有說過，是警員當時「自問自答」。李確認最終沒有去看醫生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱行動期間僅觀察無破壞-控方質疑為何黃振強仍願意給錢&quot;&gt;李稱行動期間僅觀察無破壞 控方質疑為何黃振強仍願意給錢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另問及李在「屠龍」的參與程度。李同意每次向黃振強索取資助時，他都表現「疏爽」。李又指，參與「屠龍」的行動約10次，過程中只是在旁觀察，並無參與破壞行為。另外有一半的行動自己則無參與，並用不同藉口推搪。控方質疑：「你而家係咪話畀我哋聽，黃振強容許你做呢啲嘢，不過對於你要攞錢仍然有求必應？」李同意。控方又問有沒有「屠龍」成員不滿李的做法並作出埋怨；李表示沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱以高達戰艦作為tg名稱-控方問打外敵革命&quot;&gt;李稱以《高達》戰艦作為TG名稱 控方問：打外敵？革命？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後問李的 Telegram 用戶名意思，控方問及「I am reinforce Jr.」名稱有何典故。李解釋動畫《高達》其中一部戰艦名為「Reinforce Junior」，他喜歡《高達》帶出的反戰概念。控方問及戰艦的用途，李表示負責打仗。控方追問：「打外敵？革命？」李解釋是幫助國家打外敵。張官問：「高達咁多隻艦，你特別鍾意『Reinforce Junior』？」李同意。張官追問是否貌似人形；李回答不是，並指：「閣下講嗰隻應該係《超時空要塞》。」控方再問李另一用戶名「John Lemon」有何意思，李解釋自己喜歡「Beatles」成員約翰連儂（John Lennon），亦喜歡其宣傳和平的理念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由於代表李家田的大律師林芷瑩不適發燒，因此案件押後至下周一（15日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Washington Summit – double-hatted as the NATO 75th anniversary – focused more on the founding of NATO and its past success as “the world’s most successful military alliance” rather than fully engaging with future challenges, both immediate and long-term. Moreover, scheduled in July, it was a summit designed to support President Joe Biden’s re-election bid, maximising the celebrations and avoiding controversies. The deliberately lowered expectations led to only incremental progress, both in the ongoing transformation of the Alliance’s defence and deterrence posture, and on support to Ukraine. Instead, the summit was dominated by the DC chatter surrounding the US presidential election in November, which will be hugely consequential for NATO, Ukraine and European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;political-volatility&quot;&gt;Political Volatility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political preamble to Washington was intense. Biden’s underwhelming performance in the first election debate has sparked growing calls for him to cede to a younger Democratic candidate. These interventions grew louder during the summit, with the closing unscripted press conference becoming a litmus test of the president’s abilities on the world stage, which he failed. Over in Europe, centrist parties were overcome in the EU Parliamentary elections in June, which pressed French President Emmanuel Macron to call a snap parliamentary election. While the worst-case scenario – a majority for the far-right National Front – was averted, French lawmaking will now be paralysed, giving more electoral ammunition to the far right for the 2027 presidential election. Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s ruling coalition in Germany was equally challenged, but it will likely limp on for another 15 months. Going against this grain, in the UK, the Labour Party won a landslide election victory and with it a strong mandate to govern. Meanwhile, Hungarian President Viktor Orban – who holds the rotating EU Council Presidency – visited the Kremlin on a “peace mission” and shook hands with President Vladimir Putin, providing a stark reminder that NATO has a growing Hungary problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last development is particularly repugnant as the summit week began with Russia bombing the Okhamdyat children’s hospital in Kyiv and other medical facilities. These strikes were likely a deliberate policy to demonstrate to already nervous European countries the cost of escalation. If this was the intent, it backfired as NATO countries rallied together to announce an additional strategic and tactical air defence package for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-new&quot;&gt;What is New?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the language on China is now much stronger than at previous summits, with Beijing now labelled a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s war in Ukraine. The declaration states that “The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation”, which is a significant step for the Alliance in calling out its hostile intent. However, it mainly identified and admired the problem, rather than outlining what NATO should do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, defence industrial cooperation was a focal point, with a separate “NATO Industrial Capacity Expansion Pledge” published alongside the main declaration, which will be critical in restocking NATO militaries as quickly and as efficiently possible, together with ensuring long-term industrial support to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the central objectives was to “Trump-proof” NATO support to Ukraine. With no invitation, NATO sought to “bridge” membership through three measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a “NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine” will be established – at a new command in Wiesbaden, Germany – to transition lead responsibilities from the US to NATO on coordinating support and training and place it on an “enduring footing, ensuring enhanced, predictable, and coherent support”. This is twinned with the creation of a senior NATO civilian representative post in Kyiv to allow closer coordination. However, Germany vetoed its original “mission” designation over concerns this could be escalatory. These semantic gymnastics and overall timidity towards Ukraine will be seen by Putin as weakness, and degrade NATO’s own deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The deliberately lowered expectations led to only incremental progress, both in the ongoing transformation of the Alliance’s defence and deterrence posture, and on support to Ukraine&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, a €40 billion package was agreed for Ukraine in 2025. A five-year commitment had been favoured by the NATO Secretary General, but Allies wanted an annual review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, a Joint Analysis Training and Education Center will be set up to jointly identify and apply lessons from the current war and increase Ukrainian interoperability with NATO. This will act as a critical feedback loop for NATO’s Allied Command Transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These commitments are not trivial, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was very careful to not come across as ungrateful as he was at Vilnius, which annoyed many Allies at the time. However, these collective commitments do not move the dial decisively in Ukraine’s favour. Political slogans to support Ukraine for “as long as it takes” were repeated. However, there were no definitions from the many speakers at the Public Forum on what a Ukrainian victory would actually look like – or, for that matter, a Russian defeat. At Vilnius, the requirement for Ukrainian membership of NATO was “when allies agree and conditions are met”. A year on, Ukraine is still none the wiser as to what these conditions are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-missed-opportunity&quot;&gt;A Missed Opportunity?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central victory for Ukraine was the following passage from the summit declaration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We welcome the concrete progress Ukraine has made since the Vilnius Summit on its required democratic, economic, and security reforms. As Ukraine continues this vital work, we will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine, and its advocates, secured the stronger language of an “irreversible” path towards NATO. However, this wording is anything but irreversible for two reasons. First, a future President Donald Trump could renege on the commitment, with fears that a US government led by him could offer up a commitment that Ukraine will never join NATO in future negotiations with Russia. Second, Macron, straight after the declaration from the 2019 London meeting of the North Atlantic Council was published, rowed back on the agreed language on China. Summitry wording does not equal policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the only procedurally “irreversible” mechanism would be an invitation for Ukraine to join the Alliance. It was a missed opportunity for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, unity. The short-term desire to harness the unity that NATO has enjoyed since Russia’s 2022 invasion is detrimental to its longer-term health. It has been 16 years since NATO made the commitment at the Bucharest Summit that Ukraine (and Georgia) “will become members of NATO”. With the irreversible language in 2024, NATO has backed itself into a corner, with little semantic room left for the subsequent years. As such, it will get harder and harder for NATO to satisfy support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, a formal invitation would give NATO, and the US, greater control on the timing of Ukraine joining at the precise moment “when conditions are met”. Through the use of Article 11 (Ratification) of the Washington Treaty, the Allies could show support to Ukraine and gradually manage escalation with Russia, even using it as a punishment for Russian behaviours by incrementally moving Ukraine closer through national ratifications in response to Russian atrocities such as the Okhamdyat strike. This would be preferable to waiting until “conditions are met” – presumably an end to the war in Ukraine’s favour – and then starting the process, which could take years (the quick ratifications of Finland and Sweden’s accession were an exception to the rule).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, there is nothing in Article 10 (Invitation) to suggest that NATO can withdraw an invitation once made. Therefore, this could “Trump-proof” Ukraine’s membership of NATO and ensure it is not offered up in any peace deal with Russia that would surely cause a deep rupture in the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, an invitation now would pre-empt more difficult electoral maths in national parliaments to ratify the Assession Protocols. With such political instability across the Euro-Atlantic, NATO might never have had a better chance of getting ticks in the box. Of course, there is a possibility that parliaments – under different compositions – could “deratify” the protocols in the future, but this would be difficult to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, it would firmly anchor Ukraine into the Euro-Atlantic security architecture. Policymakers should consider what is currently happening in Georgia as a cautionary tale. There is no guarantee that a future political leadership in Ukraine might not also turn away from Europe. It was striking that the Washington declaration removed all reference to Georgia, showing that 16 years of hard work since Bucharest in 2008 have been wasted due to the passing of Georgia’s new foreign agents law – widely dubbed the “Russian Law” – derailing Tbilisi’s Euro-Atlantic path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, an invitation would be the ultimate expression of democracy – mentioned in the preamble to the Washington Summit – allowing Allies and national Parliaments to demonstrate support for Ukrainian membership, and those that have reservations to voice them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uk-leadership&quot;&gt;UK Leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With political challenges for the leaderships of the US, France and Germany, the contrast with the UK’s new government mandate at a critical time for the UK, Europe and NATO was stark. The summit was an immediate opportunity for new UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to meet and greet world leaders. The momentum will continue next week as the UK hosts the fourth European Political Community summit with around 40 European leaders at Blenheim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Due to the transatlantic political volatility, there is a real opportunity for the UK to increase its leadership role within NATO&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prime minister, flanked by his new Foreign Secretary David Lammy, his Defence Secretary John Healey and Minister for European Relations Nick Thomas-Symonds, put on a show of force in the US to reassure allies and partners. Throughout its election campaign, the Labour Party emphasised its NATO credentials, historically referencing the Party’s and Ernest Bevan’s role and confirming an “unshakeable” commitment to NATO and an “iron clad” commitment to the nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the transatlantic political volatility, there is a real opportunity for the UK to increase its leadership role within NATO. Indeed, it is likely to be necessary. However, the UK’s ability to lead within NATO – beyond words – largely rests on the conclusions of the UK’s next Strategic Defence Review (SDR), which will be announced by the prime minister next week. Three steps will make this possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Defence Intelligence and the wider UK Intelligence Community should be used to make an assessment of when the government believes the UK might have to commit to war in Europe. This would bring the UK in line with NATO itself and many European allies, and it would be the key to informing resourcing and capability choices – the difference between getting ready for 2027 versus 2033 is stark. It would also provide a target to communicate to the Treasury to negotiate the required increase in funding, or argue to more appropriate funding mechanisms for defence. This assessment should also be openly communicated to UK society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, to meet a “NATO first” approach, the SDR should fully align with the NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP) rather than try to circumvent it. The UK should directly ask NATO what is required through the process for this four-year cycle and likely the subsequent two. This would then become the foundation of the SDR to avoid national programmes and projects that do not align.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the role of UK nuclear weapons should be emphasised. The UK, unlike France, assigns its nuclear forces to NATO, and in a more dangerous world and with the risk of a disengaged US, Europeans are putting more emphasis on nuclear deterrence. The UK’s nuclear capability should also be better used as a bargaining tool within the NDPP, rather than an added extra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;america-first&quot;&gt;America First&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the multiple European elections this year, it is only the US election that really matters for European security. Former President Trump was not at the summit, but his spectre loomed large. Next week is the Republican National Convention, where he will officially become the nominee. If he does win the election, the 2025 NATO summit in The Hague will be very different to Washington, and it will force NATO to face the hard choices that it continues to defer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, Japan has taken historic steps to strengthen its defense posture and in turn the U.S.-Japan alliance, which has entered a period of unprecedented integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a far cry from the time of the alliance’s origins in 1951. With pacifist principles deeply embedded in its postwar constitution, Japan once prioritized economic development and resisted defense cooperation with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this starting point, how did Japan evolve into a significant military power capable in its own right of reinforcing deterrence across the Indo-Pacific region?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/programs/japan-chair&quot;&gt;CSIS Japan Chair&lt;/a&gt; compiled a short history, supplemented by a repository of official statements and interviews with experts, to document the remarkable evolution of this security partnership. This is Alliance Online, a resource tool documenting the evolution of the U.S.-Japan alliance, a security relationship critical to the history — and future — of international relations in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-foundation-for-the-us-japan-alliance-took-form-with-three-key-events&quot;&gt;The foundation for the U.S.-Japan alliance took form with three key events:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The signing of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20136/volume-136-I-1832-English.pdf&quot;&gt;1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty&lt;/a&gt; that ended the Pacific War&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The signing of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/japan001.asp&quot;&gt;1951 Security Treaty&lt;/a&gt; between Japan and the United States&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A subsequent revision of the bilateral treaty in 1960 known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-america/us/q&amp;amp;a/ref/1.html&quot;&gt;Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the Security Treaty, Japan retained the right to self-defense under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7&quot;&gt;Chapter VII, Article 51 of the United Nations Charter&lt;/a&gt;. However, Japan also renounced war as a sovereign right under &lt;a href=&quot;https://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html&quot;&gt;Article IX&lt;/a&gt; of its new constitution, written by the United States during the postwar occupation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and the United States signed the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, which allowed U.S. forces to retain bases in Japan after Japan regained sovereignty. However, the first version of the treaty included no obligation for the United States to defend Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-yoshida-doctrine&quot;&gt;The Yoshida Doctrine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As pressure from the United States on Japan to strengthen defense began to increase, Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru reluctantly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.loc.gov/resource/llglrdppubt.2019668409/?sp=2&amp;amp;st=text&quot;&gt;established&lt;/a&gt; Japan’s Self-Defense Forces in 1954.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was based on a government interpretation of the constitution that minimal defense capabilities were permissible under Article IX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some conservatives in Japan at the time pushed for a stronger military and for a broader interpretation of the constitution to allow the right of collective self-defense, Yoshida &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nids.mod.go.jp/english/event/forum/pdf/2003_01.pdf&quot;&gt;advocated&lt;/a&gt; a minimalist approach to allow Japan to focus on economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/kishidas-realism-diplomacy-yoshida-doctrine-values-based-diplomacy&quot;&gt;Yoshida Doctrine&lt;/a&gt;, under which Japan would ally with the West but do the minimum necessary for defense cooperation while focusing on reviving the economy, took hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-strategic-bargain-1&quot;&gt;The Strategic Bargain&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Cold War tensions in Asia intensified in the aftermath of the Korean War, the two governments &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mod.go.jp/en/j-us-alliance/joint-declaration/treaty/index.html&quot;&gt;revised&lt;/a&gt; the bilateral security treaty in 1960.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revised treaty enshrined the U.S. commitment to defend Japan in Article V in return for permission to retain bases in Japan “for the maintenance of international peace and security in the Far East,” captured in Article VI. The United States also retained control of Okinawa until 1972. This was the broad strategic bargain that remains the foundation of the U.S.-Japan alliance to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these early days, few in either country thought that Japan would eventually emerge as a true military partner of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The massive protests that took place in Japan in response to the revised treaty — &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1958-60v18/d201&quot;&gt;which led President Eisenhower to cancel a planned visit&lt;/a&gt; to Japan in June 1960 — reflected concerns about the potential to become drawn into Cold War conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Japan gradually focused more on defense as the regional security environment became more severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-cold-war&quot;&gt;The Cold War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite the controversy in Japan surrounding the 1960 security treaty, strategic debates also reflected a parallel concern that a failure to develop defense capabilities could weaken U.S. support for Japan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Sw741W5.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ During the Cold War, Japan’s proximity to the Soviet Union necessitated a focus on homeland defense, especially in the surrounding seas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This created an “entrapment vs. abandonment” dilemma that animated Japanese defense policy during this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion of Soviet military power in East Asia would eventually necessitate increased emphasis on homeland defense, especially in the surrounding seas, to deter a Soviet attack and secure imports of natural resources critical to Japan’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sea lane defense was the focus of two key documents: Japan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldjpn.net/documents/texts/docs/19761029.O1E.html&quot;&gt;National Defense Program Outline&lt;/a&gt; of 1976 and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://japan2.usembassy.gov/pdfs/wwwf-mdao-defense-guidelines1978.pdf&quot;&gt;Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation&lt;/a&gt; of 1978, highlighting the alliance’s increased importance in the Cold War. This set the stage for Japan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/09/world/japanese-premier-vows-even-greater-efforts-on-defense.html&quot;&gt;commitment&lt;/a&gt; in 1981 to take on responsibility for defending sea lanes out to 1,000 nautical miles from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reinforcement-of-the-yoshida-doctrine&quot;&gt;Reinforcement of the Yoshida Doctrine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as Japan took modest but important steps to strengthen defense cooperation with the United States, it also implemented new measures that reinforced the Yoshida Doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1967, Japan adopted the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/un/disarmament/nnp/index.html#:~:text=My%20responsibility%20is%20to%20achieve,line%20with%20Japan's%20Peace%20Constitution.&quot;&gt;Three Non-Nuclear Principles&lt;/a&gt;, barring the country from possessing, manufacturing, or introducing nuclear weapons. The same year, it imposed an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/un/disarmament/policy/index.html&quot;&gt;effective ban&lt;/a&gt; on defense equipment exports. And in 1976, Japan announced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nippon.com/en/features/h00196/&quot;&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt; of limiting defense spending to 1 percent of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True to Yoshida’s vision, Japan focused on economic recovery while remaining allied with the West — yet gradually embraced a greater role in defense in response to the Soviet threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;burgeoning-economic-friction&quot;&gt;Burgeoning Economic Friction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshida’s emphasis on economic revival also featured prominently during this period, and by the 1980s Japan’s economic power became a source of friction with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20181203003241/http:/www.g8.utoronto.ca/finance/fm850922.htm&quot;&gt;1985 Plaza Accord&lt;/a&gt; was intended to rectify trade imbalances, but it instead increased Japanese investment in the United States and generated criticism of Japan’s economic prowess as the U.S. economy struggled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This introduced a new dynamic to alliance ties that threatened to overshadow progress in defense cooperation critical to U.S. strategy in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-19892000-&quot;&gt;[ 1989–2000 ]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;purpose-lost-and-regained&quot;&gt;Purpose Lost and Regained&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A series of crises in the immediate aftermath of the Cold War precipitated an effort to redefine strategic objectives for the U.S.-Japan alliance.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/j9F3ANY.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ In the post-Cold War era, the rise of security threats close to home — including North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs — convinced Japan to expand its traditional concept of self-defense to focus more on regional security.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first Gulf War in 1991, Japan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nippon.com/en/features/c00202/&quot;&gt;considered&lt;/a&gt; dispatching the Self-Defense Forces to support peacekeeping operations in response to U.S. pressure but failed to do so and was criticized for “checkbook diplomacy” after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nippon.com/en/features/c00202/&quot;&gt;contributing $13 billion&lt;/a&gt; to support the coalition against Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;renewal-of-alliance-purpose&quot;&gt;Renewal of Alliance Purpose&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imes.boj.or.jp/research/papers/english/me19-s1-14.pdf&quot;&gt;collapse of Japan’s “bubble” economy in 1992&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent U.S. emphasis on trade imbalances complicated the bilateral relationship even as the regional security environment deteriorated. Washington became increasingly focused on the threats posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and a newly rising China. But a coalition government in Japan began to emphasize multilateral diplomacy and a focus on Asia over the alliance with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alarmed by the potential for drift in the relationship, then assistant secretary of defense Joseph Nye launched a strategic review of the alliance. He published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nautilus.org/napsnet/napsnet-special-reports/east-asia-strategy-report/&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in February 1995 that emphasized the importance of U.S. forward military presence in East Asia in a post–Cold War world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Events in and around Japan added further urgency to the reconsideration of alliance purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by U.S. servicemen in 1995 precipitated a political crisis in the U.S.-Japan alliance and increased pressure to reduce the U.S. military footprint on Okinawa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other events drove home the continued relevance of a robust forward U.S. military presence for regional stability. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Media/News/News-Article-View/Article/3253814/averting-escalation-and-avoiding-war-lessons-from-the-19951996-taiwan-strait-cr/&quot;&gt;Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1995–1996&lt;/a&gt; — in which China conducted missile tests around Taiwan in response to Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui’s visit to the United States — prompted the United States to respond with aircraft carrier deployments to the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wTMkEEQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of these events, Washington launched a dialogue with Tokyo to define the future of the U.S.-Japan alliance and rebuild the consensus in both capitals about the relationship’s importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effort culminated in April 1996 with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-america/us/security/security.html&quot;&gt;joint security declaration&lt;/a&gt; that affirmed the alliance as the “cornerstone . . . for maintaining a stable and prosperous environment for the Asia-Pacific region.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that document, the two governments &lt;a href=&quot;https://warp.da.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/11591426/www.mod.go.jp/e/d_act/us/anpo/pdf/19970923.pdf&quot;&gt;agreed to revise&lt;/a&gt; the 1978 guidelines for defense cooperation, to include cooperation for the first time in “situations that may emerge in the areas surrounding Japan” — code for a Korean contingency — signaling Japan’s willingness to loosen its traditional emphasis on primarily its own defense to focus more on regional security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1996, the governments also produced a blueprint for reducing the impact of the U.S. presence on Okinawa, including plans to relocate Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, which is located in a heavily populated area and thus is a symbol of local frustration with the U.S. military presence on the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-20002012-&quot;&gt;[ 2000–2012 ]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-war-on-terror-and-rebalance-to-asia&quot;&gt;The War on Terror and Rebalance to Asia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, marked the beginning of a new chapter in alliance cooperation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Gulf War period, Japan under Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro moved quickly to support the United States after the attacks and passed &lt;a href=&quot;https://japan.kantei.go.jp/policy/2001/anti-terrorism/1029terohougaiyou_e.html&quot;&gt;special legislation&lt;/a&gt; to dispatch Maritime Self-Defense Force vessels to the Indian Ocean in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://japan.kantei.go.jp/koizumispeech/2003/07/26danwa_e.html&quot;&gt;similar bill&lt;/a&gt; was passed after the onset of the Iraq War to allow the Self-Defense Forces to support reconstruction efforts under Operation Iraqi Freedom. Some 600 Ground Self-Defense Force personnel were deployed to Iraq to provide non-combat support to the war effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both “special measures” laws were historic and facilitated a role for Japan in international security beyond its immediate region. Initially unpopular, both measures earned public support over time as Japan’s contributions were &lt;a href=&quot;https://avalon.law.yale.edu/sept11/state_009.asp&quot;&gt;recognized internationally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expanding role for Japan under Koizumi prompted the U.S. and Japanese governments to initiate a review of alliance roles, missions, and capabilities in a regional and global context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee or “2+2” process — meetings between the U.S. secretaries of state and defense and their Japanese counterparts — became the driver of progress in the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint statements in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-america/us/security/scc/joint0502.html&quot;&gt;February&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-america/us/security/scc/doc0510.html&quot;&gt;October&lt;/a&gt; 2005 outlined common strategic objectives for the alliance and added efforts to improve the international security environment as a third pillar for alliance roles and missions (in addition to the defense of Japan and situations surrounding Japan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;friction-over-us-force-posture-in-japan&quot;&gt;Friction over U.S. Force Posture in Japan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2006, the two governments announced a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsp.guam.gov/wp-bsp-content/uploads/govarchieve/G01-60.166%202006%20May%201_United%20States-Japan%20Roadmap%20for%20Realignment%20Implementation.pdf&quot;&gt;realignment plan&lt;/a&gt; for U.S. forces, including a plan to move approximately half of the 18,000 U.S. Marines stationed on Okinawa to Guam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effort to realign U.S. force posture stemmed from a desire to better position the United States to address international terrorism and other new global security challenges while reducing the impact on the Japanese people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Japanese concerns about the latter would test the alliance a few years later during a period of political transition in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009, the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/31/world/asia/31japan.html&quot;&gt;wrested political power from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)&lt;/a&gt;, which had ruled for much of the postwar era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Hatoyama Yukio was chosen by the DPJ as its first prime minister. He introduced the concept of an “&lt;a href=&quot;https://japan.kantei.go.jp/hatoyama/statement/200911/15singapore_e.html&quot;&gt;East Asian Community&lt;/a&gt;” as the centerpiece of his foreign policy, placing greater emphasis on multilateral diplomacy to promote economic and security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hatoyama also sought to revise the 2006 realignment plan for U.S. forces and &lt;a href=&quot;https://japan.kantei.go.jp/hatoyama/statement/201005/28kaiken_e.html&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the entire U.S. Marine Corps presence on Okinawa be relocated off the island. Although neither proposal was realized, the process of revisiting alliance agreements was challenging for alliance managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-great-east-japan-earthquake-and-rising-threats-in-asia&quot;&gt;The Great East Japan Earthquake and Rising Threats in Asia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frictions over the alliance continued until the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 11, 2011. That natural disaster cast the U.S.-Japan alliance in a new light as the U.S. and Japanese militaries &lt;a href=&quot;https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R41690/16&quot;&gt;coordinated large-scale humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts&lt;/a&gt; to support Japan’s recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By early 2012, the alliance was again on firm footing, and under Prime Minister Noda Yoshihiko the two governments successfully negotiated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.secnav.navy.mil/eie/ASN%20EIE%20Policy/2012-04-27%20Joint%20Statement%20of%20the%20Security%20Consultative%20Committee.pdf&quot;&gt;adjustments&lt;/a&gt; to the 2006 force posture plan, preserving plans to reduce the Marine Corps presence on Okinawa while changing the composition of units moving to Guam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for Japan to strengthen deterrence in response to China’s military ambitions and tensions in the South China Sea and East China Sea subsequently shaped defense policy debates, ultimately yielding new strategies released after the LDP returned to power in late 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This coincided with a strategic decision on the part of the United States to focus more cohesively on regional affairs under President Obama’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/asia_pacific_rebalance_factsheet_20130412.pdf&quot;&gt;rebalance to Asia&lt;/a&gt;,” reviving a process of strategic alignment with profound implications for U.S.-Japan alliance cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-20122024-&quot;&gt;[ 2012–2024 ]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;alliance-integration&quot;&gt;Alliance Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Under Prime Minister Abe Shinzo, Japan unveiled its first National Security Strategy in 2013.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ASB6SSx.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s growing assertiveness in the South and East China Seas, combined with increasing frictions over Taiwan, prompted a shift in Japan’s focus to the south and west.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy defined Japan’s national interest in strengthening its own defense capabilities, the U.S.-Japan alliance, and partnerships with other like-minded partners in Asia to manage a rising China and shape the regional order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Abe government pushed through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cas.go.jp/jp/gaiyou/jimu/pdf/anpohosei_eng.pdf&quot;&gt;reinterpretation of Article IX of the constitution&lt;/a&gt; to allow Japan to exercise the right of collective self-defense under limited circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It then prevailed in a contentious policy debate that resulted in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/files/000143304.pdf&quot;&gt;package of defense policy reforms in 2015&lt;/a&gt; to codify the reinterpretations and authorize expanded roles for the Self-Defense Forces in a contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a member of the United Nations, Japan already enjoyed the right of collective self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter, but since Yoshida, successive governments had chosen not to exercise that right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abe considered this step essential to enhancing Japan’s role as an alliance partner, and though limited in scope, the 2015 reforms allowed Japan to provide direct support for U.S. military operations if an attack against the United States threatened Japan’s survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The range of Japan’s new contributions featured in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/files/000078188.pdf&quot;&gt;revised guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for U.S.-Japan defense cooperation released that same year. The new guidelines enabled the two militaries to plan for a wider range of contingencies and strengthen interoperability between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-birth-of-foip&quot;&gt;The Birth of FOIP&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abe also established Japan as a regional leader. His government released a broad diplomatic strategy in 2016 known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/afr/af2/page4e_000496.html&quot;&gt;Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP)&lt;/a&gt; strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOIP was designed to foster bilateral and multilateral interactions on political, security, and economic affairs while promoting regional institutions to support regional stability and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s blueprint for what it called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cas.go.jp/jp/siryou/pdf/2019boueikeikaku_e.pdf&quot;&gt;multilayered security cooperation&lt;/a&gt;” informed the regional strategies of the United States and several other nations, which all introduced their own FOIP visions to underwrite a free and open rules-based order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the postwar era, Japan enhanced its defense capabilities and roles in the U.S.-Japan alliance incrementally in response to changes in the security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in many ways, the postwar constraints on Japanese defense policy remained in place even through the Abe era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enhancing-defense-cooperation&quot;&gt;Enhancing Defense Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine — and Beijing’s support for Moscow — had a galvanizing effect on Japanese public opinion. In 2022, the government led by Prime Minister Kishida Fumio unveiled the second &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cas.go.jp/jp/siryou/221216anzenhoshou/nss-e.pdf&quot;&gt;National Security Strategy&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mod.go.jp/j/policy/agenda/guideline/strategy/pdf/strategy_en.pdf&quot;&gt;National Defense Strategy&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mod.go.jp/j/policy/agenda/guideline/plan/pdf/program_en.pdf&quot;&gt;buildup plan&lt;/a&gt; to dramatically strengthen Japan’s defense posture and enhance defense cooperation with the United States and other like-minded partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ambitious agenda includes plans to nearly double the defense budget by 2027, invest for the first time in long-range counterstrike missiles and other capabilities to strengthen deterrence, and bolster Japan’s defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Japan’s Defense-Related Expenditures* (1997–2023)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The April 2024 Kishida-Biden summit in Washington clearly demonstrated a commitment to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/10/united-states-japan-joint-leaders-statement/&quot;&gt;strengthen defense cooperation&lt;/a&gt; with the United States. Kishida also has worked to deepen Japan’s ties with other like-minded partners, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/a_o/na/kr/page1e_000810.html&quot;&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/a_o/ocn/au/page1e_000761.html&quot;&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/files/100575977.pdf&quot;&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/erp/ep/page7e_000023.html&quot;&gt;North Atlantic Treaty Organization&lt;/a&gt; (NATO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes represent a fundamental departure from Japan’s strategy at the onset of the Cold War, when pacifist principles, concerns about entrapment in military conflict, and a focus on economic power were the dominant features of Japanese strategic culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and the United States are building an alliance that is more integrated bilaterally and with other partners to maintain stability and order in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite important constraints, including Article IX of its constitution, Japan will likely continue to move away from the Yoshida Doctrine and invest even more in defense to ensure the security of the nation and the region as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the postwar history of the U.S.-Japan alliance is any guide, this process will continue to evolve in response to new challenges that could undermine that order in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;李家田稱坐椅子上被拳打氣門 控方質疑警員有大肚腩難彎身&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/maNY4Vt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（11日）踏入第51日審訊。被告李家田供稱警方上門拘捕時，被安排坐在電腦椅上，遭多名警員拳打腳踢。控方代表大律師周凱靈在盤問階段指出，曾上庭作供的男警5820梁樂文「相當大隻」及「好大肚腩」，因此控方質疑李的說法並問：「你係咪要我哋相信呢個說法，一個大肚腩警員烏低身打你氣門？」、「佢屈住大肚腩打你？」；李同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李家田同意黃振強對嚴文謙帶女友行動有微言&quot;&gt;李家田同意黃振強對嚴文謙帶女友行動有微言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第四被告李家田第四日作供，接受辯方盤問。代表嚴文謙的大律師梁鴻谷指出，Telegram「滅龍」群組的對話顯示，嚴多次表示因要陪伴女友，未能出席黃提議的示威行動，他亦曾提出會帶女友一同出席示威行動。黃因此以粗口責罵嚴，一度指「又帶條友出嚟佗手掕腳走唔切咁點，你救佢，我救你呀？」、「你帶住佢我就唔出，你自己諗」。辯方指，「屠龍」行動一般「唔方便帶女眷」因需要快速及有力量；李同意。另外，李同意從對話中感覺嚴的女友「比較有支配性」，而黃振強曾對嚴的行為有微言，不滿嚴的女友「痴住佢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示審訊時才知黃振強用資金賭錢-對他欺騙隊友感婉惜&quot;&gt;李表示審訊時才知黃振強用資金賭錢 對他欺騙隊友感婉惜&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，李同意黃原打算12月1日在尖沙咀行動，而嚴回應身處韓國未能出席，最終黃決定取消。李表示，沒有聽過黃表示因沒有嚴一同行動，失去安全感故取消。辯方其後問，隊友之間是否經常拿名為「毒蛇隊長」的人來開玩笑，因他經常稱有大殺傷力武器藏在山洞；李同意。辯方展示對話紀錄，顯示嚴曾稱：「我哋使唔使搵人守洞？」李表示以其理解，嚴應該是說笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另問及小隊的資金，李表示留意到黃曾向其他隊友提供資助，一般是「有求必應」。李又指，隊員之間沒有討論黃如何處理獲得的款項。直至審訊期間，李才知道黃利用滙豐個人戶口收取過百萬資助，並使用款項賭錢及作為泰國旅行支出。辯方問李，在得悉黃收取的資金與給予隊員的金額不成正比，有否感到憤怒；黃表示沒有，但同意辯方指對於黃一直欺騙隊友感到婉惜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李早前稱告知隊員懷疑自己被警方跟蹤，辯方問：「佢哋有冇表示擔心，有冇人覺得需要避吓、需要防範？」李表示沒有。辯方追問成員有否擔心「樹大招風」；李回答他們並無這方面的擔心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示成員在安全屋討論打機-唔係咁認真示威&quot;&gt;李表示成員在安全屋討論打機 「唔係咁認真示威」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表劉佩凝的大律師馬維騉問到，成員有否在安全屋討論將來的示威行動。李表示成員「唔係咁認真示威」，通常會玩或者打機；若有行動的話，只會在 Telegram 群組商討。李同意，「屠龍」成員的行動只涉堵路或裝修，即使有用汽油彈亦無意傷害人，也從沒有使用致命武器傷害人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示留在屠龍為搜集故事-控方質疑無證明&quot;&gt;李表示留在「屠龍」為搜集故事 控方質疑無證明&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表大律師周凱靈進行盤問。李表示加入「屠龍」後，參與不超過10次的示威行動。控方質疑，李在「屠龍」成名後，卻沒有選擇退出群組；李表示自己為了搜集資料作電影素材。控方質疑，李沒有依照其「故事大綱」執行，沒有其他資料顯示他有搜集故事。李同意沒有紀錄，又指在示威現場只是透過觀察搜集故事，包括在理大觀察到示威者陷入絕望和恐慌狀態，但沒有訪問他們。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，由加入「屠龍」直至被捕，他共向黃索取一萬多元，黃一直是「有求必應」。李又指，沒有見過黃將現金交給其他被告。控方質疑：「即係你同佢交情好特別？」李回應因他私下問黃拿錢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另問到「屠龍」向警方投擲汽油彈之目的，李表示他們可能想嚇退警察，但強調自己沒有使用汽油彈，只見過黃振強及嚴文謙使用。李又指，成員聚會期間通常會「吹水」及「講笑」，有時會事後檢討行動，但不會討論將來的行動細節或部署。控方指，黃被捕後小隊變得「群龍無首」；李表示多名成員被捕後，小隊已屬解散狀態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方問警員毆打時是否拳拳到肉李表示並非用全力&quot;&gt;控方問警員毆打時是否「拳拳到肉」李表示並非用全力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李家田稱，於2020年6月11日被警方上門拘捕時，他上身赤裸、遭多名警務人員拳打腳踢及施行「水刑」，過程約30至45分鐘。控方問警員在毆打時是否「拳拳到肉」；李不同意並指：「覺得佢唔係用全力打我。」控方並問：「唔係錫住你、揩下你就當打？真係有力度？」李表示並非太用力，雖然不是很痛，但氣門被打時感覺辛苦。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑警員有大肚腩-難以彎身打李&quot;&gt;控方質疑警員有大肚腩 難以彎身打李&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦質疑，警員毆打坐在電腦椅的李，「佢打你，你咪轆走？」李表示沒有這個情況出現。控方亦問，警員5820是否要「烏低身」打李的氣門；李同意。惟控方指根據庭上所見，他「相當大隻」、「好大肚腩」；李同意。控方遂質疑：「你係咪要我哋相信呢個說法，一個大肚腩警員烏低身打你氣門？」、「佢屈住大肚腩打你？」；李同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱警腳踢其腰-控方質疑難發力&quot;&gt;李稱警腳踢其腰 控方質疑難發力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李的證供亦指，警員6314用穿上軍靴的腳踢其左腰間。控方要求李站起身示範，其後代表李的大律師何正謙坐在椅子上，李提高右腳示範踢向其左腰。李解釋，當時雙手被反鎖背後，感覺警員運用六成力度踢。控方質疑：「你會同意警員踢你嘅動作難發力？」李表示若該警員有學過武術，或可以發力，但最後同意控方指，沒有學過武術的人難以發力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李早前的證供亦透露，當時亦遭偵緝警署警長馮保羅掌摑臉部至少10下。控方問及力度時，李表示對方不算大力，他亦不太感到痛楚。控方最後問：「雖然你話痛，話唔係好大力，咁有冇傷痕？」李表示腹部沒有傷痕，但腰間有直徑6厘米的紫色瘀痕，至於臉部則不覺得有腫脹。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wa8EBQP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後李要求吸煙，警員於是將李的雙手鎖在前方，他自行用火柴點煙。控方質疑：「扣住隻手點火？」李同意。李續指，在追問下他表示「支槍喺鴻仔度」。但警方卻捏造李曾稱自己有份去西貢試槍。控方亦質疑，實際上警方已搜獲與本案數量符合的手槍，為何警員會稱「唔對數」；李表示不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李承認錄影會面時-未能說出警方要求記住的被告姓名&quot;&gt;李承認錄影會面時 未能說出警方要求記住的被告姓名&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李亦透露，事後警員著他記住本案被告的人名。他不同意控方指，由於認識他們故容易記住姓名。但李同意自己在錄影會面時未能交代任何一個被告的姓名，他解釋指不記得。控方展示李的 PayMe 紀錄，顯示黃轉賬時顯示他的全名。控方質疑：「你真係要我哋相信，你唔知佢咩名？」李表示不知道付款者是否黃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李解釋為免被警方誤會參與暴動-故更改-telegram-用戶名&quot;&gt;李解釋為免被警方誤會參與暴動 故更改 Telegram 用戶名&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另問，李為何在黃被捕後將 Telegram 用戶名改為「黃又南」；李解釋為免引起不必要誤會，被警方以為自己參與暴動，亦擔心警方可能拘捕群組成員。李強調自己沒有參與破壞及堵路行為，只是在現場搜尋示威者故事。控方問李是否有詢問示威者，他表示沒有。控方遂問：「嗰故事從天嚟話畀你聽？」李不同意，強調是透過觀察獲得故事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦質疑，李為何要訛稱手槍放在自己的綠色斜孭袋。他表示：「我受到咁不人道待遇，唯有講啲嘢出嚟畀佢」，並想「攞啲證據」滿足警方。控方亦問：「綠色斜孭袋絕對可以裝到支槍？」李表示需要嘗試。控方回應：「你要我試？好呀！」控方遂將證物手槍併到袋上，又一度問警方：「無子彈㗎可？」最後李同意可以擺放。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（12日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KioGZUy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今續處理參選衞生服務界的余慧明求情。代表余的大律師石書銘表示，余以護士為志業，組織工會和參選僅為服務公眾，她一直倡以非暴力和合法手段向政府施壓，惟本案後很大機會不能再任護士，已付出代價。而余所屬的衞生服務界沒有協調會議、亦無討論35+後的行為，認為余屬「積極參加者」較低級別或「其他參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上又讀出余撰寫的求情信，余提及參選立法會是望增加議價能力和改變死局，但卻被指控為顛覆國家政權，「是其他民主國家聞所未聞」；而法庭裁決指「五大訴求」為空中樓閣，但當中包括落實《基本法》承諾的雙普選，余反問：「如果政府視落實23條是憲制責任，難道落實雙普選不是一樣嗎？」余又表明，即使到現在仍認為透過在立法會投票改變既定秩序並沒有錯，「或許我唯一犯下的錯誤，就是我太愛香港。」法官陳慶偉聞言後打斷，指這並非求情信，着辯方勿發表政治演說；又一度說：「那就不要求情，你不用求情，那沒有問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;毛孟靜岑敖暉何啟明無到庭&quot;&gt;毛孟靜、岑敖暉、何啟明無到庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已完成求情的毛孟靜、岑敖暉、何啟明今無到庭，其餘6人則按男女分成上下兩排，由懲教人員隔坐。昨繫領帶的馮達浚今無繫領帶，岑子杰則換上一件深藍色T裇，並向旁聽席展示背面圖案，又拉下口罩逐一向旁聽人士微笑揮手，又向律師揮手。余慧明則身穿卡其色外套。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;多名社民連成員包括周嘉發、陳寶瑩、黃浩銘，前民陣召集人陳皓桓，及前沙田區議員李志宏等均有旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方余以醫療服務為志業組織工會為服務公眾&quot;&gt;辯方：余以醫療服務為志業、組織工會為服務公眾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師石書銘先為前醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明求情，石陳詞期間，余坐得畢直，表情嚴肅望向前方。石指，余案發時33歲，已婚，在香港出生和長大，在大學時已以醫療服務為志業，修讀護理系並成為註冊護士，再進修成為深切治療部護士。余在前線工作多年，但因貢獻有限，因此決定轉到醫管局總部，擔任醫療信息管理助理主任。石強調她不是望有更舒適的環境工作，而是希望令更多病人受惠，並形容從余的學歷、職業，再到2019年組織工會，一路以來，都可見她熱心公共服務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石形容，余是政治素人，對政治不感興趣亦無參與政治，2019年的運動令香港市民關注日常生活的法律與秩序，是她的覺醒（awakening）；直至其後疫情爆發，影響每名香港人，驅使她作出行動。石強調，工會獲同事支持，提出的關注與政治無關，而是關乎公共衞生和採取措施以防生命損失。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CkhxrIM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石指，一個巴掌拍不響，無論事後回看余的想法何其激進，但當時他們只是對當權者的做法作出回應，可惜要求封關的訴求最終不獲理會，余遂決定參與立法會選舉。石又指，余出身自勞動階層的家庭，以非凡的努力實踐專業，再決定參政，作為一名花這麼多時間就公共衞生作出貢獻的工會領袖，余在其他地方或會被嘉許，但因本港政治環境獨特，余如今面對的卻是定罪。法官陳仲衡打斷，指余是因案發的行為、而非因其公共服務而定罪，石書銘表示明白，但強調余所做的是她公共服務之路的一部分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方余不知謀劃非法倡以非暴力和合法手段施壓&quot;&gt;辯方：余不知謀劃非法、倡以非暴力和合法手段施壓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘又指，余供稱否決預算案的理念來自網上和傳媒的討論，當時「35+」是熱門話題，但討論並非關於意圖顛覆國家政權，而是圍繞民意如何能在立法會更好地反映，亦是余參選的原意。雖然余亦多次提及否決預算案以令政府對話，但相關行為在《國安法》生效前屬合法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iCi9Inw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 余慧明（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石續指，案發時無人清楚知道初選或涉案謀劃是否合法，包括余慧明，而她唯一獲權威告知合法性，是2020年7月9日出席初選記者會時，戴耀廷提及認為初選在《國安法》後仍合法，石望法庭接納余案發時一直強調運用合法手段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰要求提供證據支持，指明白戴耀廷曾稱謀劃合法，但問題是被告是否相信，因或許有頑固的激進分子（die hard radicals）明知非法仍願繼續。石指，余並非那些頑固的激進分子，並舉例余在疫情時曾望發起「大三罷」，她不是望以暴力手段、而是運用法律下示威的權利進行施壓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石又指，作為從事醫療行業的人，余並非會使用暴力的人，她亦不想見到更多傷亡，就如她提到2019年醫院附近施放催淚彈影響病人，令她非常關注。而余相信《基本法》對落實雙普選的承諾，認為屬「五大訴求」中最重要，她一直以合法和非暴力手段向政府施壓，以帶來改變，並相信否決預算案是在《基本法》框架底下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指余或失護士資格&quot;&gt;辯方指余或失護士資格&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石指，余是一名年輕的理想主義者，她本性非常有同情心，不幸地因對法律的不確定，選了錯誤的一邊。而余作為一名註冊護士，本案後很有機會面對紀律處分，亦因本案控罪非常嚴重，可以肯定當局不會從輕處理（taken lightly），很大機會余不能再成為一名護士。石指，余成年後的人生均貢獻於醫療服務，但現在因為本案，她須以餘生付出代價，望法庭考慮並判處合適的刑期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4JIlzdM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余慧明求情信稱唯一的錯或在太愛香港&quot;&gt;余慧明求情信稱唯一的錯或在太愛香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘續指，今早聆訊前，收到來自余慧明的求情信，並望於庭上讀出。（＊英文全文及中文翻譯見文末）余提及，2019年100萬名港人上街反修例，但聲音不獲聆聽，引發激烈街頭抗爭，余不欲再看到示威者再犧牲和被捕，加上政府未能及時採取措施預防新冠疫情爆發，故望進入體制，增加議價能力和為改變當時的死局，但此舉卻被指控為顛覆國家政權「是其他民主國家聞所未聞」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又指，法庭裁決提到「五大訴求」是空中樓閣，但當中包括落實《基本法》承諾的雙普選，反問：「如果政府視落實《基本法》23條是憲制責任，難道落實雙普選不是一樣嗎？」余又表示，「即使到現在，我仍然認為透過在立法會投票，改變既定秩序並沒有錯，或許我唯一的錯誤，就是我太愛香港。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官打斷促勿發表政治演說不求情沒問題&quot;&gt;官打斷促勿發表政治演說、不求情沒問題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石欲繼續讀下去時，被法官陳慶偉打斷，指：「這不是一封求情信，這是政治演說，如果你想代你的當事人發表政治演說，我沒有問題，但不要在我的法庭這樣說。」石書銘回應，余在這封信解釋了她參與本案的原因，惟法官李運騰指，問題是在信中看不到減刑因素。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石再解釋，這是還柙多時的余所表達的想法。陳慶偉重申她可以在法庭外這樣做，但不是在這個法庭，又提高聲量說：「事實上，相反地，我們看不到任何悔意（“In fact, on the contrary, we see no remorse whatsoever.”）」，並補充「那沒有問題的，我們不是要求悔意，那是她的選擇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石續指，本案涉及政治，如被告對所做的表達悔意，或被人質疑他們的信念是否真誠。陳慶偉聳肩和搖頭說：「那就不要求情，你不用求情，那沒有問題。（“Then don’t mitigate, you don’t have to mitigate, you see, that’s fine.”）」石最後指，認為余在信中有展示悔意，惟陳慶偉不接納，石續沒有讀出餘下內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方建議余為積極參加者較低級別&quot;&gt;辯方建議余為「積極參加者」較低級別&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就余的參與程度，石書銘指，衞生服務界的情況與其他區有些不同，該界別初選的意圖只是防止分薄票源、增加勝出機會，而且沒有舉辦協調會議和選舉論壇，參選人也沒有與組織者討論達成35+後要做什麼。石形容，在整個案發過程，余基本上獨自行事，亦無證據她就35+與其他人討論，她簽署「墨落無悔」時亦認為不少內容不適用於衞生服務界。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石又指，余在謀劃的參與程度一直較低，她沒有策劃謀劃，即使她出席7月15日抗爭派記者會，亦是最溫和的參與者，只提及期望勝出者有更多合作，沒有提倡否決預算案。雖然有其他同場參與者提及否決，法庭亦裁定可以「共謀者原則」指證余，但不代表余支持，而余在會上親自說的話，或更值得法官在判刑時考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石指，若以三級刑期分級制作參考，建議余屬「積極參加者」（判監3至10年）的較低級別，但亦補充，雖余較其他被告就否決預算案表達較清晰的立場，但從整個謀劃來看，衞生服務界較其他界別少競選活動和討論，望法庭亦考慮余屬「其他參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方余很有可能被dq謀劃不大可能成功&quot;&gt;辯方：余很有可能被DQ、謀劃不大可能成功&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石又提到即使余在初選勝出，以她案發時的言論，也很有可能被DQ。法官李運騰關注，有辯方稱被告無被DQ，故顯示他不激進；有辯方則稱因被告被DQ，其參與較輕，似乎無論DQ與否都是求情因素，兩者陳詞矛盾。石解釋，若被告被DQ，則無法繼續落實謀劃並帶來危害，並同意法官總結指，政府能DQ候選人本身，已顯示謀劃不大可能成功，不會造成潛在危害，是針對所有被告的求情因素。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方引抗爭派記招問答-指王真誠誤信否決屬合法&quot;&gt;辯方引抗爭派記招問答 指王真誠誤信否決屬合法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，王百羽一方昨求情時，法官關注辯方稱王案發時真誠誤信謀劃為合法，但看畢其求情信，似乎看不到他有這樣說，要求辯方提供具體證據。代表王的大律師黃俊嘉今補充，2020年7月抗爭派記者會上，有記者問及承諾否決所有議案是否涉違《國安法》時，有發言者解釋否決是議員被賦予的合法權利，不存在任何脅逼或違法情況，王百羽續說「係啦」，可反映他肯定該發言者的理解，即否決屬合法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡表示，《基本法》賦予否決預算案的權力、但並非無差別否決，而該發言者也沒有就無差別否決作出回答。黃俊嘉指，對法律錯誤的理解正是由此而來，因當被問及無差別否決是否違法時，發言者回答這是《基本法》賦予的權力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪、周天行、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋。岑子杰由大律師郭憬憲代表，毛孟靜和岑敖暉由大律師黃雅斌代表，何啟明由大律師阮偉明代表，馮達浚由資深大律師祁志代表，黃碧雲由大律師沈士文代表，劉澤鋒由大律師黃錦娟代表，余慧明由大律師石書銘代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;正如我在證供所說，對我來說，一切都源自2019年的反修例運動。當時一百萬名香港人上街，和平地反對修例，遺憾地，他們的聲音不獲聆聽，最終引致激烈的街頭抗爭。而現在，在那場民主運動開始逾5年過後，政府視那些參與的市民為「暴徒」，並標籤運動為「黑暴」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年時，我相信即使有持續的街頭抗爭，政府仍然對公眾的不滿置若罔聞。我最不想看到的，是有示威者再犧牲和被捕。再者，由於政府未能及時採取措施預防新冠病毒在社區爆發，因此我希望進入政治體制——參選立法會，增加議價能力，改變當時的死局。然而，此舉被指控為顛覆國家政權，這是其他民主國家聞所未聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭裁決提到「五大訴求」是空中樓閣，但是那些訴求當中，包括落實《基本法》承諾的雙普選。如果政府視落實《基本法》23條是憲制責任，難道落實雙普選不是一樣嗎？即使到現在，我仍然認為透過在立法會投票，改變既定秩序並沒有錯，或許我唯一犯下的錯誤，就是我太愛香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have stated in my evidence, for me everything stemmed from the Anti-Extradition Bill movement in 2019. Back then over a million Hong Kong citizens took to the streets and expressed their opposition to the amendment peacefully. Regrettably, their voices went unheard and eventually triggered off vigorous street protests. And now, more than 5 years after the democratic movement began, the government regards those citizens who took part in the movement as thugs and labels the whole movement as “Black Riot”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, I believed that even with continuous street protests, the government would still turn a deaf ear to public grievances. The last thing I wanted to see was further sacrifices and arrests of the protestors. Moreover, since the government failed to take timely measures to prevent the community outbreak of COVID-19, I thus wanted to enter our political institution – to stand for election in the Legislative Council, to increase the bargaining power and bring changes to the deadlock at that time. Yet it was accused as subverting the State Power. This is unheard of in other democratic countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Verdict stated that “Five Demands” were castle in the air. Yet among those demands was the implementation of dual Universal Suffrage as promised by the Basic Law. If the government deemed implementing Article 23 a constitutional duty, isn’t implementing dual Universal Suffrage the same? Even now, I am still of the view that there is nothing wrong in bringing changes to the established order through voting in the legislature, perhaps the only wrong I have committed was that I love Hong Kong too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第四批被告今完成求情，本月30日將處理第五批被告求情，為8名新界西初選參與者：朱凱廸、張可森、黃子悅、尹兆堅、郭家麒、吳敏兒、譚凱邦、伍健偉，料需時3天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指岑子杰2012年未經批准集結罪成後-無重蹈覆轍&quot;&gt;辯方指岑子杰2012年未經批准集結罪成後 無重蹈覆轍&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余慧明一方完成求情後，代表岑子杰的大律師郭憬憲表示，已呈交書面陳詞，庭上只有簡單補充。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他指，岑於2018至2020年擔任民陣召集人，並引述同案從犯證人區諾軒為岑撰的求情信，指岑是九龍西協調會議上反對無差別否決預算案的「關鍵人物」，對於阻止無差別否決預算案成為九西的共識具決定性作用。郭憬憲指，岑的罪責和其他人不同，參與程度屬最輕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭又提及，岑於2012年曾干犯組織及參與未經批准集結罪，判處罰款5千元。法官李運騰指，相關案底已是10年前，辯方毋須提及，郭則強調，岑已汲取教訓，他在2019年曾舉行很多集會，全部均有向警方申請不反對通知書，指只是一次定罪便令他改變，再沒有犯下相同錯誤，正如區諾軒在信中提到，岑是非暴力和守法的人，2019年組織公眾活動時與警方合作。郭並指，就其他個人情況已寫在書面陳詞上，不會再在庭上重複。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，岑向旁聽席微笑豎起拇指，又向律師席的郭憬憲做致敬手勢，黃碧雲和王百羽等也向親友揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to invite your lordship to consider mercy on account of his political orientation. As what I have mentioned in my testimony, with representing League of Social Democrat, he was the key person who objected the advocacy of voting against the budget indiscriminately in the Kowloon West coordination meeting at material period of time. Despite any of his offence afterwards, I would like to emphasise his objection was decisive in preventing the advocacy to be the consensus in the Kowloon West meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我邀請法官閣下考慮岑子杰的政治取向，寬大處理，正如我的證供所述，岑代表社民連，是九龍西協調會議上反對無差別否決預算案的關鍵人物，不論他事後的控罪，我希望強調他的反對，對於阻止無差別否決預算案成為九西協調會議的共識，具決定性作用。&lt;/p&gt;

This paper seeks to identify lessons relevant to the British Army, based on analysis of IDF operations in autumn 2023. The paper is a study of military tactics and does not address the wider operational and strategic situation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As regards dismounted close combat in an urban environment, the IDF found that the risk of fratricide owing to cross-boundary fires meant that units should have non-contiguous unit boundaries for units advancing along the same axis. Thus, IDF units would have a movement corridor, and a fires corridor allocating on each side. Given the very narrow frontages of manoeuvre, it was found necessary to have combined arms elements in intimate support down to platoon level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDF had persistent challenges with rubblisation, both because it created obstructions for movement and degraded the ability to describe the terrain and thus coordinate and control fire. The IDF has concluded that specific training is necessary for what it is terming “devastated terrain warfare”. Specific drills for talking soldiers onto target when looking at irregular terrain must be practised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also found that adopting a sequential approach to surface and sub-surface operations ceded initiative to the enemy and reduced tempo as units mounted deliberate clearance operations in their rear area. Instead, the IDF found that it was more effective to carry out simultaneous surface and sub-surface operations. This required careful battlespace management as movement below ground did not always correlate with unit boundaries above ground. In general, the IDF did not find that there was much of a requirement to deliberately clear high-rise buildings, as there was limited tactical value in being above the second floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operations in Gaza have highlighted the criticality of organic lethality at echelon. Hamas tactics have evolved over the course of the fighting, but each iteration saw different groupings of fighters endeavour to rapidly engage isolated IDF units before disengaging. In practice these tactics did not perform well because Hamas was not able to concentrate sufficient firepower. It therefore often failed to inflict significant damage, while the IDF were generally able to suppress attackers and thereafter deliberately target them. For the British Army the lesson is clear: organic lethality must be increased in close combat echelons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to responsively employ precision fires in close proximity to friendly forces – allowing higher echelons to increase the lethality of close combat forces – has become critically dependent on access to the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). The IDF found that once units had UAS organic to their formations, there was a significant challenge to identifying friend or foe. Once the enemy was also employing UAS, friendly electronic protection saturated the spectrum, interfering with digitised command and control. This has produced a requirement for reversionary methods to be available, and for improved EMS battlespace management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDF ultimately suppressed Hamas’s capacity to concentrate forces because of its access to air delivered effects. It is worth noting that buildings do not offer significant protection against air delivered munitions, because of the weight of ordnance that can be dropped with precision. The lesson for the British Army is that urban defence must be premised on effective air defence covering the urban space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of air delivered fires to bypass the physical protection offered by urban terrain creates significant challenges for discrimination. First, there is the question of what cannot be seen as regards concealed civilians. Second, in conventional and unconventional conflict, combatants are increasingly blending in with the civilian population in a manner that makes discrimination difficult. The IDF have struggled with this problem and it has been exacerbated by the IDF ceding critical elements of the information environment, such as casualty estimates, to entities associated with Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The humanitarian situation in Gaza has been disastrous. Much of this relates to issues of getting aid into the Strip, which, other than ensuring the efficiency of searching cargos at scale, is a political rather than tactical military problem and therefore falls outside of the scope of this paper. Where there are transferable lessons for the British Army is in the challenges the IDF have had in distributing aid. On the one hand Hamas has sought to gain control over aid distribution to re-establish control of the territory. This is antithetical to Israel’s war aims. Yet the IDF closely supervising distribution is a recipe for clashes at aid points. The IDF has not found a system that assures adequate supply and distribution of aid while also preventing Hamas from exerting control along the process. This dynamic challenge bears careful study as meeting humanitarian obligations are an essential part of urban operations, but when required at scale can rapidly unhinge the tempo and capacity of a formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more lessons identified in this paper that bear scrutiny. There are also likely to be further lessons that emerge from later stages of IDF operations in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spectre of urban operations has been an enduring concern among professional militaries. In 2017, the liberation of Mosul was perceived as simultaneously demonstrating how difficult such operations are and providing an effective model for how Western militaries could project power into urban spaces while transferring the risk onto partner forces; in that case, the Iraqi security forces. The war in Ukraine has resurrected appreciation of the need to be able to conduct complex offensive action into urban terrain, for while the conditions for an urban operation are set in surrounding rural areas, translating tactical success into operational success is often dependent on the ability to enter and successfully seize towns and cities. Given repeated warnings from British defence figures that today is a “pre-war” period, any opportunity to learn lessons about the contemporary battlefield that could improve the readiness of the British Army deserves study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Hamas launched an armed attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, massacring civilians and taking over 250 hostages, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not have the option of transferring the risk onto a partner force. Faced with the simultaneous – and more severe – threat from Hezbollah on Israel’s northern border, the IDF elected to conduct a rapid combined arms assault into dense urban terrain, which had been extensively prepared by Hamas to support protracted defensive operations. Moreover, the assault was in terrain inhabited by a large civilian population hostile to the IDF’s presence and under intense international scrutiny. Given that the IDF is a modern military, drawing on a range of emerging capabilities, its operations are worthy of study to identify lessons relevant to the British Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines IDF operations – tactics, force structure, capabilities and operational design – during the initial operation in Gaza City in autumn 2023. The paper is intended to highlight tactical lessons that have wider applicability and to discuss the problems that have driven tactical adaptation in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to emphasise what this paper does not attempt to do. It is not an assessment of the likely efficacy of the IDF’s operational design or strategic goals. Nor does it make recommendations about how the conflict may conclude. Rather, it is a study of military tactics. The paper does not assess the ethical or political debate surrounding aspects of Israeli operations, except insofar as the challenges confronted by the IDF would also pose tactical challenges to the British Army under comparable conditions. These questions, while highly important and the subject of ongoing debate, are best addressed separately. The paper is also limited to discussion of operations in 2023 in Gaza City and does not extensively cover subsequent operations in Khan Younis or Rafah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence base for this paper draws on author interviews with strategic-, operational- and tactical-level IDF commanders and analysts from a range of units that have operated in the Gaza Strip during the war. This includes interviews with Israel’s Southern and Northern Commands, with personnel from divisional and brigade staffs and at the battalion level. The IDF have also established lessons learned cells in all their formations, and with battalions assigning an officer to provide observations to the brigades from the beginning of their ground operations. These were analysed at the divisional and regional command echelon, and where contradictory information arose, were investigated. The authors spent time with the lessons learned officers and saw samples of their data. Of the 44 core interviews with IDF personnel, most interviewees ranked between OF4 and OF7. The authors directly observed some of the processes described. The authors also engaged with IDF personnel prior to the conflict and observed IDF training, including for urban operations. In addition to this primary evidence collection, the authors have collated and analysed a significant body of combat footage and reports on the conflict written by both journalists and academics and have maintained contact with some humanitarian personnel working on and in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are significant limitations to the evidence collected, and the extent to which it can be used. Hamas commanders were not accessible for interview. The authors did not endeavour to interview diplomatic and UN staffs, whose work does not cover military operations. There is also a significant body of evidence collected that cannot be made public or exploited in this paper because its publication would breach operational security. Where this arose, the authors did not address these subjects. The exact details of Israeli intelligence processes and adaptations following the failure to anticipate the attack on 7 October are sensitive, and it was decided to omit discussion of this topic, rather than address it in a manner that was self-evidently inadequate. Another area that is not substantially addressed is the efforts to recover Israeli hostages. While they have had a significant impact on the conduct of the war, these operations are also sensitive, and lessons relating to hostage rescue cannot be adequately covered at this time with the information that is releasable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has seven chapters. Chapter I is a brief overview of the context within which the IDF formulated its operational plan and the scheme of manoeuvre for the first operation against Gaza City. It is not intended to be a detailed narrative of the war. The subsequent chapters each cover lessons relating to warfighting functions: mounted and dismounted close combat; combat engineering; subterranean operations; fires; information operations; and humanitarian support operations. The paper concludes with considerations of the relevance of the identified lessons and specifically how they relate to emerging concepts in the British Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-operational-context-7-october-to-24-november-2023&quot;&gt;I. Operational Context: 7 October to 24 November 2023&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamas initiated its ground invasion of Israel on 7 October 2023 with a carefully synchronised breakthrough of Israel’s border defences. Although combat groups of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades (the military wing of Hamas) had been instructed to train and equip for the assault and capture of Israeli villages and IDF outposts for some time, these small-scale exercises by individual Hamas units had become somewhat routine. The planning for 7 October had been carried out by a small group, with instructions to individual Hamas units given in isolation, so that only upon assembly were its fighters given briefs on their specific objectives and an indication of the scale of the operation. These briefs were detailed, covering the location of IDF defensive positions and command posts, the layout of military installations and kibbutzim, and in some cases, the working and sleeping quarters of IDF commanders and local officials. The original breaching force also operated with effective communications discipline, with very little use of mobile phones or other communications systems until they were engaged by the IDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breaching of the border saw Hamas coordinate the blinding of surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities using UAVs, snipers and anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) to destroy the cameras and communications antennae along the Gaza border. This simultaneously prevented IDF command posts from receiving information and stopped their transmission of instructions to subordinates. Breaches of the border fence were then executed at 50 points using bulldozers, frame charges and explosive Bangalore torpedoes. In addition, six fan-powered parachutes flew to three points inside Israel, while seven fast boats attempted a maritime insertion along the Israeli coast. The assault force was spearheaded by up to 2,000 Hamas fighters and participants from other armed groups in Gaza. The initial assault force was divided into combat groups, each of which was given specific objectives with prepared intelligence on the location of individual Israeli commanders and garrisons. The headquarters of IDF units and police forces were directly attacked. As the raid occurred during a national holiday in Israel, the IDF were left with very little situational awareness, without their communications infrastructure to coordinate a response, and with a lack of mobile reserves. Hamas teams also seized and held road junctions, impeding IDF movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of setting the initial conditions for the conflict, it is important to note that Hamas fighters deviated significantly from their own plan during its execution. Following behind the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigade fighters were around 1,000 Gazans, who – seeing the breaches in the fences – followed the assault force onto Israeli territory, and were the source of a significant proportion of the social media posts and videos from 7 October. Discipline among Hamas fighters at this point appears to have broken down. The original planning documents showed that Hamas had intended to fortify the positions it had seized and use hostages to complicate the IDF’s retaking of these positions. Hamas had brought rations and medical and combat equipment for extended operations. The chaotic massacre that unfolded diverted efforts to prepare for a deliberate defence. In some respects, the devastation created chaos that complicated efforts to bring the immediate situation under control on 7 October. At the same time, Hamas’s lack of prepared fighting positions made the IDF’s reclamation battle for the seized territory far easier over the following days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDF forces mobilised extremely quickly. In the initial 24 hours, this was to a large extent a process of self-mobilisation, whereby reservists and soldiers on leave rushed to the area near the Gaza border without clear chains of command established, or unit boundaries drawn. This resulted in losses of personnel and equipment. A good example is an IDF CH-53 helicopter, piloted by a former member of the aviation unit, which picked up a unit of paratroopers and flew them directly into the combat zone without deconfliction. The troops were inserted, but the helicopter was destroyed. The deployment of this unit was not part of any higher-level plan but was implemented by commanders and reservists at unit level. Despite this intermingling of troops from units across Israel creating an extremely chaotic battlespace, it also seriously disrupted Hamas fighters’ freedom of manoeuvre in and around the locations they had seized. Command and control (C2) of the IDF’s initial response was also complicated by the fact that Hamas had destroyed many of the antennae supporting military C2 systems around Gaza, while the capture of a large quantity of Israeli communications equipment forced the IDF to distribute new encryption keys for its military communications before they could be used. This meant that the IDF had to revert to civilian communications for the initial 48 hours of the war, with a corresponding lack of operational security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDF mobilisation became more deliberate within 48 hours as reservists were called up, assembled and moved to assembly areas. The appearance of formed units with their command echelon in the battle area enabled an increasingly deliberate series of reclamation battles to take occupied positions. The IDF had largely regained control of the ground within 72 hours, with clearance operations for a further three days eliminating surviving pockets of resistance. Some infiltrators remained on Israeli territory for up to three weeks but were not operationally significant beyond the first five days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the 7 October attack, the Israeli cabinet declared war on Hamas. Given that the Israeli government had seemingly not anticipated any such attack, a precise formulation of Israeli war aims took some time to coalesce, and some tenets of the implementation remain subject to debate. Nevertheless, within the first five days IDF commanders were planning against three core military objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The destruction of Hamas’s military infrastructure and capabilities to a point where they no longer threatened Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The recovery of hostages.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The removal of Hamas as the de facto government in Gaza in order to deny Hamas the ability to regenerate its combat power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These objectives, authorised by the Israeli cabinet, became the basis for operational planning as soon as the IDF had regained control of Israeli territory. Other objectives that were more political in character were articulated at various points by Israeli ministers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDF officers concluded that a ground invasion would be necessary to remove Hamas from control of the Gaza Strip. The IDF had previously conducted incursions into the Gaza Strip, as during Operation Protective Edge in 2014. However, the aims of the incursions between 2008 and 2023 were far less ambitious in terms of the amount of terrain that had to be manoeuvred through. The IDF had plans for the full occupation of Gaza, which had been rehearsed in command post exercises. Nevertheless, the number of troops assessed to be necessary meant that these plans could not be fully exercised without a call up of reserves. The scale of the operation envisaged in 2023 meant that there was a requirement for a deliberate force build-up and an extended period of planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The period available for preparation was – in the view of IDF planners – constrained by three factors. First, alongside the ground attack on 7 October, Hamas initiated a massive rocket barrage of Israeli military and civilian sites. In response, the Israeli Air Force conducted an immediate large-scale air campaign against identified Hamas targets in Gaza and assessed rocket launch sites. Despite these efforts, it was assessed that rockets would continue to be launched if Hamas could cache weapons underground, and so would only be prevented from launching more rockets by the IDF physically seizing the terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, IDF planners believed that there was a window of opportunity created by the 7 October attack during which the international community would give Israel freedom of action, and that this window would close. This belief stemmed from the experience from previous rounds of fighting. Indeed, just prior to 7 October, a senior IDF planner had indicated to one of the authors that the closing of the window within which operations could be conducted had prevented any kind of critical threshold being reached to change the dynamic during previous rounds of escalation with Hamas, as during 2021. The scale of the Hamas incursion in October 2023 meant that the IDF expected to have a longer period with freedom of action, but time was nevertheless considered a finite resource, and this created a belief among planners that they had to act sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, although Hezbollah had not coordinated any operations against northern Israel with Hamas on 7 October, it did begin to attack Israeli communities with rockets in the days following the operation, and mobilised a large body of fighters. With the threat of a major escalation in the northern theatre coinciding with the commitment of forces in Gaza, the IDF assessed that it needed to be able to rapidly complete the most intensive part of operations in Gaza – the urban break-in – to enable forces to subsequently pivot north. Moreover, the longer the Hamas rocket barrage continued against Israel, the more Iron Dome interceptors would be used, increasing Israel’s vulnerability to Hezbollah’s much greater missile arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the impetus to act quickly, the plan formulated by the IDF ground forces involved an advance into Gaza City on three axes. First, there were raids planned towards Beit Hanoun. These incursions, largely at night, both enabled the emplacement of forces in Gaza and confirmed Hamas in its belief that its phase lines for a deliberate defence should be orientated to confront an assault from this axis. The second axis divided Gaza City from southern Gaza by pushing along the northern side of Wadi Gaza, thereby isolating Hamas forces in the city from their line of resupply. The third axis was the main effort, heading south along the coast on a narrow front and then turning in to Gaza City. The coastal axis was intended to enable the IDF to circumvent most of Hamas’s prepared defences. The plan therefore committed three mechanised divisions simultaneously into an area smaller than 70 km2 to confront an adversary of approximately 20,000 personnel amid a civilian population of more than 600,000 people (approximately 1.1 million in the operational area north of Wadi Gaza, as compared with 40,000 Hamas fighters across the Strip).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that there has been some discussion of Gaza’s population density in the media, suggesting that it is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. Exact measures of population density vary, depending on where studies draw their boundaries. Like most cities, Gaza City had some pockets of extremely high population density, while across the Strip, the density is within the distribution for modern cities. Recognising that Gaza is not exceptional as an urban space is important, because it makes the lessons from Gaza in this regard transferable to other militaries in other theatres of operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These lines of effort were initiated on the night of 27 October and made considerable progress, so that by the time a ceasefire was declared to allow the exchange of prisoners for hostages on 24 November, a large part of Gaza City was under IDF control. The IDF has subsequently conducted operations against Khan Younis, and at the time of writing is conducting operations in Rafah, and it has also undertaken further raids into Gaza City in response to Hamas re-entering parts of the city that had previously been cleared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a rough outline of the scale of operations and scheme of manoeuvre, it becomes possible to identify a range of tactical lessons and adaptations that the IDF has learned over the course of the fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-mounted-and-dismounted-close-combat&quot;&gt;II. Mounted and Dismounted Close Combat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme of manoeuvre for each axis was drawn up at the divisional echelon, under the IDF Southern Command as the operational headquarters. On the main axis, the division committed two brigades to an axis of advance less than 1 km wide. The brigade composition was an armoured battalion, a mechanised infantry battalion, an infantry battalion, a combat engineering battalion, an artillery battalion, a special forces attachment, and enablers. The boundaries between battalions were drawn down the centre of city blocks. The initial incursion was led by D9 bulldozers, intended to overcome IEDs. Exact employment differed block by block and between units, as the formations used were ad hoc. However, a rough outline of the tactical approach saw the D9s work one bound ahead of Merkava main battle tanks, with the heavy armour moving in pairs of vehicles. They would establish overwatch to enable Namer infantry fighting vehicles to then move forward and disembark infantry into buildings flanking the next bound. As the mechanised infantry moved forward, light infantry would advance to clear and hold terrain to prevent attacks on the rear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been some debate as to the significance of high-rise buildings during urban operations and the extent to which armies need to work out how to fight within them. The evidence from Gaza suggests that these structures are of limited military value. In terms of their use as observation posts, it is difficult for observers positioned on the higher floors to maintain oversight of the cityscape beneath them without also exposing themselves to observation. Above a certain height, the streets become dead ground. Furthermore, fighters who move up a multistorey building lose the ability to reposition laterally. The IDF therefore found that observers would remain in the first few levels of a building (not least because observation from higher altitude can be achieved more effectively by UAVs), while fighters rarely ventured above the second level. This is consistent with observations from Ukraine, largely for the same reasons. Using sensors to detect activity on higher floors to engage them with fires is a relevant capability, but there appears to be a limited requirement for ground manoeuvre forces to extensively occupy and clear higher floors. Tall buildings do bring complications for close combat elements, however. First, to attack an enemy on lower levels with fires often requires higher payload ordnance. This is because the angles available to reach a target in a high-rise area are constrained by obstructions, and thus attacks often need to strike a higher floor but impact a lower floor. This has implications for collateral damage. It also means that there is an increased risk of rubble and debris falling further away from the building, increasing the minimum safe distance from friendly infantry within which fires could be employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the IDF made rapid progress during the early break-in, rubblisation caused a range of problems. Tank drivers could not accurately assess the depth of craters through night vision, especially when there had been rain, and some vehicles were lost owing to roll-overs when vehicles drove into shell holes. Another problem arose from a lack of terms for coordinating direct fire. Fire control in either an offensive or defensive context is best conducted through the designation of unit boundaries, arcs of fire, known friendly and enemy positions, and reference points. The integration of many mobilised reservists with the mixed professional and conscript force proved a challenge. While all Israeli reservists have full-time military experience from, at minimum, initial service as conscripts, many reservists had not conducted much substantial training for several years. As a result, many were out of practice and would to varying degrees operate according to outdated doctrine, impeding a common understanding when attempting to coordinate either movement or fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental factors exacerbated this problem. Gaza City’s high population density and limited urban planning created an urban environment characterised by narrow streets and irregular high-rise buildings. Furthermore, the progressive reduction of the terrain to rubble through the course of fighting resulted in an irregular, congested and complex visual environment. The extreme degree of irregularity and rubblisation proved manageable when mapping terrain from above, but was anathema to the accurate identification and designation of reference points and targets for ground units. If targets were seen by a ground unit, they would often defy precise verbal description, creating scope for their mis-designation. Forces that had been trained to talk one another onto targets using the windows and floors of a building as reference points struggled to rapidly convey where enemy were to one another in structures that no longer had uniformity. The contrast with other urban operations the IDF had conducted was sufficient that the IDF’s lessons learned teams have referred to what was experienced as a distinct category of urban operations – “devastated terrain warfare”. It should also be noted that rubblisation was to a large extent a product of IDF air- and artillery-delivered fires. This should therefore have been a factor in the planning of movement corridors and boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related challenges that IDF personnel confronted were friendly fire and combat accidents, of which there were three main causes. The first, and simplest to resolve, was unfamiliarity with the impact of heavier weapons in close terrain, especially for weapons that soldiers were qualified on but rarely used. The most common culprit was M203 grenade launchers, with several soldiers injured by fragmentation after engaging targets at too close range. Another issue was accidental cross-boundary fragmentation between units caused by heavier weapons carrying on through structures and therefore entering another unit’s manoeuvre corridor. It should be noted that communication between armour and infantry – in the IDF, this is generally done via radio – was critical for confirming channels of fire. Methods such as the use of phones mounted on the rear of tanks to speak to the crew inside were dangerous, given the functioning of active protection systems on Israeli armour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second cause of friendly fire and accidents, and much more challenging, was the difficulty in judging range and thus deconfliction lines between manoeuvre corridors. This was most pronounced when units were looking diagonally down a line of buildings. As rubblisation caused ruined buildings to visually merge, with the effect becoming more pronounced over distance or at night, movement in a building in an adjacent unit’s movement corridor would frequently be mistaken for movement within a unit’s area of responsibility. This issue was reduced, but not fully eliminated, by placing gaps between units’ movement corridors rather than having contiguous boundaries, where both adjacent units had freedom to engage targets in the intervening space. This fire zone was usually placed along a block of buildings. Another important mitigation was to use rangefinders to distinguish buildings and thereby overcome the visual merging of structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third cause of friendly fire related to perceived profiles. On several occasions, IDF personnel being tracked as mounted units dismounted to inspect buildings, run to colleagues’ vehicles to coordinate, or otherwise shifted profile. Where this caused them to appear on ISR feeds in both unexpected locations and as small numbers of armed dismounts, misclassification occurred and in some cases, strikes were directed against them. This was a particular challenge for UAV operators, since while thermal imaging allows personnel to be accurately distinguished from the background terrain, it also reduces the visual distinctiveness of uniforms and equipment. The latter problem was exacerbated by IDF reservists wearing privately acquired armour and uniform elements that did not conform to IDF-issue equipment, reducing the uniformity of the force. Given the lack of uniform among Hamas fighters, this made it difficult to accurately distinguish targets. The challenges of distinguishing Hamas fighters from civilians are discussed later in relation to targeting and fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamas’s tactics may be said to have evolved in three stages. At the beginning of the operation, Hamas appears to have conceived of its defence as being based around key junctions on the anticipated Israeli axis of advance. A strongpoint, from which a position could be overlooked, would fix IDF elements on a given avenue and coordinate the movement of small teams to then attack IDF units in flanking ambushes. This approach was disrupted by the unexpected axis of the main IDF advance. After many of the designated ambush sites were approached from different directions, Hamas thereafter began to raid and fight for key buildings and strongpoints. The fighting therefore shifted to a second stage, from being over particular intersections with favourable sight lines to building complexes that drew in IDF forces to enable attacks. The third stage of Hamas tactics emerged after the week-long November ceasefire and saw the emergence of harassing attacks by small, dispersed groups which would try to converge fires onto isolated IDF elements. As larger-scale engagements and the superiority of IDF fires inflicted heavy losses, Hamas instead switched to trying to attack weaker and smaller patrols of IDF personnel, rather than engage combined arms units. This near-uniform adaptation among Hamas cells demonstrates that they retained the ability to pass information during the initial phase of IDF operations, suggesting that the IDF was unsuccessful in fully degrading Hamas’s C2. The adaptations were consistent with Hamas’s assessed strategic objective of surviving as an armed presence across Gaza and thus retaining administrative control, even with a heavily depleted force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined with the use of fires ahead of manoeuvring elements to disrupt Hamas repositioning, the IDF did not confront heavy anti-armour ambushes, but rather sporadic and harassing engagements. However, once the IDF pushed into an area, Hamas would begin to emerge from subterranean infrastructure to conduct rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) and sniper engagements against IDF vehicles through rubblised structures. In some cases, heavy weapons were brought out from tunnels camouflaged with earth. In others, Hamas fighters would move in civilian profile without weapons and then retrieve cached arms at their intended point of ambush to conduct the engagement. Hamas arms caches were widely dispersed throughout the terrain, with IDF units reporting that about a third of structures in Gaza City contained arms. The attack groups would withdraw to subterranean positions once they had conducted an attack. Hamas’s coordination of these actions appeared to depend on spotters tracking IDF positions and then using fixed lines or runners to communicate this information. The passage of information could also be enabled through social media activity, largely indistinguishable from civilians commenting on events unfolding around them but providing significant situational awareness to combat groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sporadic anti-tank guided missile and persistent RPG threat – often manifesting from a 30–50-m distance from IDF vehicles – posed a challenge for active protection systems (APS). Where APS had either been turned off, did not have a sufficient line of sight between the sensor and the threat, or had already been expended, hits were achieved on IDF vehicles. Nevertheless, while Hamas believed that APS could be defeated with close engagements, this problem was resolved through software updates. In most cases, APS proved effective, although the distance between armour and infantry for APS to be fielded safely also offered Hamas fighters the opportunity to come in extremely close proximity to some vehicles. Nevertheless, it was found that having pairs of vehicles operate in intimate support helped to increase their survivability, as the APS could often overlap and thereby increase the magazine depth to protect the vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth briefly highlighting the number of casualties in Gaza since 7 October 2023, since these provide an indicator of the intensity of the fighting. In terms of individual engagements, Hamas has rarely concentrated forces above the size of the platoon. Nevertheless, because urban terrain causes high-intensity combat between relatively small groups of people, these fights have often been costly. From the beginning of ground operations in Gaza on 27 October 2023 to the time of writing, 287 IDF soldiers have been killed in combat, with a further 1,798 wounded, of whom 357 were classified as severely wounded. The IDF has therefore had more personnel killed so far than the UK did in the campaign to retake the Falklands from Argentina in 1982, or during the entire British campaign in Iraq from 2003. Hamas has not released casualty figures. The IDF estimated that it had killed between 10,000 and 12,000 Hamas fighters by February 2024. Estimates of civilian and combatant casualties among Palestinians exceeded 35,000. In reality, the number of people whose bodies remain under the rubble make a conclusive figure impossible to provide. However, these estimates give a sense of the intensity of the fighting, albeit one distorted by the proportion of casualties from air-delivered and indirect fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-combat-engineering&quot;&gt;III. Combat Engineering&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israeli operations started with the assumption that Hamas would have extensively laid landmines and IEDs along the anticipated routes into Gaza. Thus, Israeli forces at first either avoided roads or only used them in conjunction with meticulous clearance operations with support from D9 bulldozers, which slowed the pace of their advance. The IDF determined that it required 20 D9s per brigade to meet the required tempo of operations, although this was only allocated to the lead brigades. This proved to be largely unnecessary, as Hamas had not laid mines in sufficient concentration, and those that it had deployed along roads were often surface laid and thus easy to detect and simple to remove. It is debatable whether Hamas’s decision not to lay significant IEDs on the roads into Gaza City reflected a recognition that Israel’s combat engineering assets would make these efforts redundant. In other words, it may be that the density of breaching equipment pushed Hamas to prioritise efforts elsewhere. Hamas’s failure to mine the approaches could also have arisen from the limited time available, intensity of overhead observation, and local political impact on civilians prior to 7 October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While route proving did not demand significant engineering support, clearance and search operations placed a heavy demand on dismounted combat engineers. First, Hamas seeded IEDs throughout buildings in the Gaza Strip, and at the time of writing, these continue to inflict casualties. IEDs were also used to defend the entrances to tunnels and slow the IDF’s passage into Hamas’s subterranean infrastructure. Thus, dismounted combat engineers became an integral element of all combined arms operations. Alongside explosive ordnance and disposal (EOD) search and clearance, combat engineers were also critical to the breaching of buildings and rooms to enable the IDF to move unpredictably through the urban terrain. This reduced the exposure of manoeuvring infantry to traps and ambushes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the technical combat engineering skills required are unsurprising; any observer with experience of coalition operations in the wider Middle East and Afghanistan would be familiar with most of the dynamics at play. However, the need to integrate combat engineers with ground combat formations at the sub-unit level re-emphasised the need for a significant number of appropriately trained personnel. This also raises questions about how to distribute engineers across different formations while maintaining the ability to centralise combat engineer operations where necessary, and to assimilate lessons learned, spread them across the force and conduct training – all essential to combining arms at scale for urban warfare. Furthermore, as will be covered in the next chapter, the subterranean nature of some of the fighting meant that difficult engineering tasks would have to be conducted under even more challenging conditions underground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consequence of the engineering challenge was that the use of novel sensors to locate subterranean infrastructure required close collaboration between technically sophisticated engineering units and intelligence practitioners. Here the IDF benefited from the experience of reservists with skillsets beyond the traditional military competencies. Capturing Hamas fighters or their caches and thus their documentation demanded the ability to move through terrain quickly. This required breaching and rapid EOD support. Conversely, when examination of captured materials or interrogation of captured fighters enabled the identification of tunnels, this often required engineering reconnaissance expertise to rapidly turn this information into an actionable plan on the ground. The level of engineer training at the sub-unit level therefore exceeded what would traditionally be covered by a pioneer, but instead necessitated sappers to be distributed across the force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complexity of the terrain also produced tactical challenges where engineering equipment had to be moved between echelons quickly. The repair of water pipes and facilities would normally sit at a relatively high echelon in dedicated engineering units, as a function brought in to stabilise an environment and tend to civilians after the completion of major clearance operations. In some instances, however, the IDF elected to flood Hamas tunnels using seawater and conduct other new engineering tasks during fighting. This required specialised expertise to be brought into the area of responsibility of combat arms units during combat, and thus brought engineers to an echelon with which they did not routinely train. Nevertheless, such techniques allowed some challenges to be bypassed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At higher echelons, plans for engineering proved critical. Rainfall in Israel and Gaza can be intense, as it usually falls in concentrated periods. The impact of rainfall on the terrain was uneven, producing mobility challenges, as well as humanitarian problems relating to sanitation. This meant that as units rotated into and out of the Gaza Strip, viable movement corridors and the engineering support equipment necessary to restore mobility changed over time. Given the need to have the equipment available within a short timeframe, despite its large footprint, equipment needed to be accessible to units without being organic to them and thus a burden. This required intelligence and planning so that appropriate equipment could be pre-positioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-subterranean-operations&quot;&gt;IV. Subterranean Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent of Hamas’s subterranean infrastructure in Gaza makes it an almost unique operating environment. While not on a comparable scale, subterranean manoeuvre has been an element in fighting in Mariupol, Bakhmut, Mosul and other urban operations. This chapter is, therefore, probably the most case specific in its conclusions, but the lessons are still valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years prior to the 7 October attack, Hamas claims to have constructed more than 500 km of tunnel networks under Gaza. This required an immense volume of cement, concrete and iron, not to mention the removal of soil. The level of and exact split between Hamas coercion of and active collaboration by the civilian population remains unclear; the tunnels and their entrances run under residential buildings, schools, mosques and hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To describe Hamas’s subterranean infrastructure merely as “tunnels” is a mischaracterisation. Some were intended as covert passageways between key points – such as beneath Wadi Gaza. Others were made with the intent to bypass Israeli defences. Still others housed barracks, caches, C2 centres, data storage and manufacturing facilities. There are roughly two levels of subterranean infrastructure – commanders’ tunnels and operatives’ tunnels. These are separated, with commanders’ tunnels running deeper and with a better quality of construction and more facilities, enabling them to be used for longer-term habitation and operations. The tunnels are not one single network. While some sections are linked, many are smaller sub-networks that are not integrated into an overall underground structure, with the segmentation of the network limiting the exploitation potential of any given tunnel. While at least one major data centre was captured, the majority of underground C2 nodes were very small, consisting of as little as internet-connected or ethernet-connected laptops. These could be found throughout the tunnel networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the current conflict, it was well known that Hamas conducted tunnelling and built underground infrastructure. However, even with a capable ISR apparatus, the IDF lacked the ability to accurately map the subterranean environment. While various units of the IDF had conducted training exercises focused on hypothetical operations in Gaza, Hamas had a far better understanding of the terrain than the IDF, and this was especially true of the subterranean environment. The tunnels were also central to Hamas’s concept of operations, allowing them to reinfiltrate areas on the surface that the IDF had cleared and granting them a safe haven from the fighting above ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the operation, the IDF conceived of surface and sub-surface operations as occurring sequentially: ground would be occupied and thereafter searched, with tunnels found and denied. As the operation developed, it became evident that this allowed Hamas to persist in conducting ambushes for a protracted period and to then transition to a layered defence of underground facilities. Nor could underground infrastructure be safely bypassed. Instead, therefore, the surface and sub-surface fighting needed to be carried out simultaneously, posing competing dilemmas for Hamas’s schemes of manoeuvre. Access to the tunnels required combat engineering, while entering and clearing them demanded highly specialised equipment and procedures, and thus personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDF found that subterranean fighting was extremely stressful for its personnel and required many distinct techniques. The fact that every corner could lead to an extremely close confrontation with an enemy, or the discovery of an IED, created a staccato quality to the pressure on individuals that was corrosive of morale. This was exacerbated by the fact that while the risk of close confrontations can arise in urban operations, in tunnels there was no ability to attack from unexpected axes, or to move around a threat. Tunnels had to be cleared deliberately, and the enemy could fight a series of delaying or blunting actions throughout this process that could not be circumvented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the incursion, the IDF stressed identifying, controlling and sealing or denying the entrances of tunnels. In some cases, tunnels could be collapsed from the air, a factor that drove the use of heavy air-delivered ordnance early in the war. In most cases, however, this could not be done, for several reasons. While tunnel infrastructure could be assumed to be explicitly military in a way that above-ground infrastructure could not, offensive operations were slowed by the concerns for hostages who might be held there. Furthermore, collapsing underground tunnels could threaten the structural stability of civilian buildings above ground. Sensitive site exploitation was necessary both for obtaining further intelligence on Hamas and the missing hostages, and for documenting and attributing Hamas military activity directly below civilian infrastructure. These factors influenced a slower and more deliberate pace of subterranean operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable the widespread deliberate clearance of Hamas’s subterranean infrastructure, the IDF increasingly paired conventional and special operations units together. The special operations forces involved were predominantly a combination of troops from Shayaret-13 (Israel’s naval commandoes) and Yahalom (Israeli special forces engineers). These troops would be attached at brigade level. Clearing underground areas needed to be slow and deliberate, and there were limitations to how closely this could or should be tied to progress above ground, given the inability to provide effective mutual support or shared situational awareness except at tunnel entrances. However, by coordinating offensive operations above and below ground, dilemmas could be imposed on Hamas, constraining their movements and preventing them from using the tunnels as they wished. The specialist capabilities of special operations forces could be brought to bear in the subterranean environment, but this required a good working relationship with conventional forces that included the rapid sharing of intelligence and information, which did not always come naturally to the special operations forces and had to be actively fostered. While robots and military working dogs assisted in route proving in tunnels, much of the clearance operation continued to have to be carried out by humans, given the number of doors, steps and other obstacles confronted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One challenge to simultaneous surface and subterranean manoeuvre was that the tunnels did not adhere to the boundaries of the units operating above ground. Because of the need to have relays behind an advancing force in the tunnel to maintain communications, the C2 of units underground had to be managed by the brigade to which the forces were attached. Nevertheless, they would often cross into another unit’s boundary. This could be deconflicted through notification, but it added a further consideration for units above ground of the effects they employed and which routes were used by heavier vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v-fires&quot;&gt;V. Fires&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fires coordination during the operations in Gaza was complicated by being applied through several parallel processes. First, the IDF had a high-value target list that it began to prosecute at the onset of the conflict. This had been built using all-source intelligence fusion and included both persons and structures, including some subterranean targets. Stand-off targeting continued throughout the operation. Targets located by intelligence would be framed by reconnaissance, to cue precision strikes. “Framing” is an Israeli doctrinal term indicating that positive identification is established and then maintained until the target is struck. The processes for these targeted killings were largely unchanged from before the war; where they became significantly more complicated was how they interacted with the other forms of strike that arose during the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside targeted killings, the IDF prosecuted signature-based strikes in response to targets identified through surveillance. Early in the conflict, a good example of this kind of strike was against rocket launchers. Subsequently, the identification of groups of militants by UAVs or other routine surveillance could lead to the generation of a strike. It is important to note that because the IDF could not choose the time and place of these interdiction strikes, they would often be carried out in areas where there had not been an intelligence soak to provide a detailed assessment of likely collateral damage. Just as dynamic strikes in Mosul led in some cases to large numbers of civilians being killed because their presence inside buildings could not be detected within the timeframe of the engagement, IDF dynamic strikes against large structures have led to intergenerational casualties within civilian families. There has been much speculation in the media about the extent to which the IDF was using AI to build the target packs for such strikes. A more accurate characterisation would be that the IDF targeting teams used software tools to assist in fusing large volumes of data to generate strikes. This has significantly increased the speed and scale at which target packs can be generated. Often the target generation process has outstripped the planning process to enable targets to be prosecuted. However, the decision to strike is still made by a human, and it is a human who is accountable for how the ecosystem of data processing tools is employed. The errors that have been made are therefore not because of the software – which provides decision-makers with all the information necessary to test its conclusions – but often because operators are not taking sufficient time to verify automated conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third kind of strike was one that emerged from ground forces calling for fires. In the IDF, fires – including air strikes – were allocated to brigades, with the brigade staff responsible for determining the synchronisation of these effects with their scheme of manoeuvre, or setting targets during the time when a strike is available in response to a threat. Although ground commanders can be connected to pilots to impart their intent, the technical coordination of air strikes is carried out at the brigade command post in the IDF. The IDF does not use Joint Terminal Attack Controllers to direct strikes. Despite this, the IDF managed to conduct strikes in extremely close proximity to manoeuvre elements – up to 200 m – with minimal fratricide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of these three types of strike, in any given piece of battlespace there were three targeting processes. Different elements of international humanitarian law (IHL) and the laws of armed conflict are relevant to each process. Interception or negative treatment operations – the intelligence-driven targeting of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad personnel – had the tightest controls around them. The IDF works to positively identify a target and then to continuously frame it until it is struck. Targets tended to work hard to avoid giving the IDF easy shots, exploiting protected sites to narrow the opportunities to attack them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDF also had to deal with the problem of the revolving door. Known members of Hamas could be treated as combatants. During 7 October and Israel’s subsequent ground operations in Gaza, however, there were many Gazans who participated in military activities against the IDF. These ranged from picking up weapons and participating in fighting, to retrieving cached equipment, or “spotting”, to sustain Hamas fighters. While these individuals could be struck as participants in the conflict while they conducted these activities, targeting them once they had stopped this participation, unless they were confirmed to be members of Hamas, raises more complex legal questions. The distinction between someone incidentally participating in hostilities and someone routinely supporting Hamas can be difficult to make clearly in a way that is consistently applicable. For example, a military cook is a legitimate target in war. A civilian providing food to Hamas fighters could be a civilian providing a service and thus not a legitimate target. However, there is a boundary where this same individual becomes a participant, actively deviating from normal civilian behaviour to sustain an armed force. Where precisely the line is drawn is a matter of judgement, and under time pressure in a large-scale operation, the exact demarcation can become variable between who is making the decision and the context in which it is being made. It is important to note that this is not a challenge unique to Gaza. It has been confronted in almost every conflict to varying degrees and is becoming more complicated as the boundaries, for example, between civilian communication and spotting become harder to distinguish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of dynamic strikes could fall either under the same rules of engagement as targeted strikes, or under the rubric of self-defence in the case, for example, of destroying the launch sites of Hamas rockets. Unlike targeted strikes where the IDF had some control over the timing and thus more time to evaluate whether there was military necessity and proportionality before striking, dynamic strikes had to be carried out quickly. While the same IHL obligations applied, the time in which to exercise judgement was shorter, with a greater likelihood of mistakes. For those cases where IDF troops were in contact and called for fires, the justification for the effect was self-defence, with proportionality judged against the expected harm to IDF personnel. The judgements of proportionality and military necessity often posed problems. For example, a high-value target might be close to civilian structures. However, to attack the structure with ground forces would require strikes to support the passage of those forces to the target and would affect a much greater area of civilian structures. An air strike might cause greater immediate collateral damage, but less secondary collateral damage. Mistakes could easily be made when the same target began to be assessed on multiple processes. A high-priority target that was positively identified, but where framing was lost, could be reacquired subsequently for a dynamic strike, without the same confidence of their identity being established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge for targeteers was to construct a system to address the IDF’s obligation to take measures to reduce civilian harm, before making a judgement on proportionality. Any system devised had to scale, given the number of troops operating in the city. The eventual approach was to divide the Gaza Strip into boxes. For each box, an assessment would be made, and routinely updated, as to the density of civilians prior to the conflict, their status and how many had been displaced. IDF personnel began to examine forthcoming operational plans and synchronise measures to move the population away from areas likely to see intense fighting. This was usually done through a mixture of leafleting, outreach to mobile telephones, and recommendations on timing and routes for movement. Estimating displacement allowed for the grading of each box as to the level of civilian presence and thus the appropriate rules of engagement in the area. Such a system clearly had significant drawbacks. First, not all civilians could move. Second, the civilians had a limited understanding of the boundaries between the boxes, so that someone who had left might later return. Third, the movement corridors became threat vectors that Hamas would try to exploit, while deconflicting strikes from these corridors at such a scale proved highly challenging. There were inevitably mistakes. There has been some reporting of this process as designating IDF “free fire zones” in Gaza. Instead, the IDF was endeavouring to provide troops with rules of engagement that were appropriate to the area within which they were operating, for commanders acting on variable levels of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the eventual structure, each brigade fielded an intelligence and strike cell consisting of officers from both specialisations working in tandem, along with support personnel. However, divisional headquarters oversaw much of the targeting and deconfliction. The process was refined until it followed the stages below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intelligence-gathering and defining the location of the target.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comparing the target with the evacuation map to determine whether the area was sufficiently clear of civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Checking whether the target was close to any sensitive sites.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Checking whether any civilians could be seen or identified on target.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Considering the issuing of warnings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Choosing the correct munitions for the desired effect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confirming the rules of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Decision.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, when applied, this process produced a range of outcomes. Higher echelon decision-makers often lacked the sensors to have a high confidence assessment of civilian presence inside structures. Lower echelon decision-makers often perceived a greater direct threat to themselves or their personnel and had to decide within a compressed timeline. In some instances, where the incentives to strike between these echelons reinforced one another, errors were made. Where framing was not continuous – during dynamic strikes – assumptions could be made that led to tragic outcomes, as was the case with the strike on workers for the aid organisation World Central Kitchen in April 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area where it did prove highly effective to hold organic capabilities at lower echelon was tactical strike UAVs. It was discovered that units that had these systems as well as ATGMs could monitor more urban terrain and conduct precision strikes at tempo in support of tactical actions. The IDF benefits considerably from its fielding non-line of sight ATGMs in its units. The small size of the munitions used meant that they could be used with an expectation of precision. In some cases, one screening company with these tools was able to hold the ground that would otherwise require a battalion to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the limitations of synchronisation and airspace deconfliction measures, it proved impossible to fully track or communicate UAV use. IDF ground combat units therefore found a high degree of air defence fratricide to be unavoidable, and shot down a large number of their own UAVs. Operations also highlighted that the technology and concepts of employment for UASs had outpaced the evolution of training, and IDF personnel had to learn on the job how to both tactically employ UAVs and defend against them. This was exacerbated by the disinvestment and retirement of many short-range air defence capabilities from the IDF arsenal and order of battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vi-information-operations&quot;&gt;VI. Information Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the IDF’s planning assumption that there would be a window during which international opinion would allow for the greatest freedom of action, the IDF has worked to try to extend the timeline. First, the IDF has slowly released information as investigations have progressed about events surrounding 7 October, to keep the atrocities committed and the justification for the war as part of the discourse. Packaging video from 7 October and showing it to journalists also extended the timeframe within which the context of 7 October framed reporting on subsequent developments. Footage has continued to be released, focusing on emotive topics such as the treatment of women. This has also been used to keep the story of Israel’s hostages at the forefront of the public discourse, since this is a justification for continuing operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being forward leaning on much information release, however, information operations is an area where the IDF has underperformed during the conflict. First, there have been inconsistencies between Israel’s military and political messaging that have undermined the communication of many of the control measures put in place by the IDF. Second, the IDF has repeatedly inflated expectations of what will be found – for example, by briefing that there was a Hamas C2 centre beneath Al-Shifa hospital and releasing graphics suggesting a digitised C2 hub – and then failing to reveal something that met expectations. The IDF also undermined its own credibility by presenting a document showing the days of the week as a guard duty roster for hostages, owing to a shortage of Arabic speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond these tactical errors, it is notable that Israel has not been proactive in controlling the narrative surrounding the conflict. A good example of this is the reporting of casualty figures. Civilian casualties are to be expected in high numbers during any urban operation. In Gaza, journalists had come to rely on reporting from the Gaza Health Ministry for casualty figures. The Gaza Health Ministry has a track record of producing reasonably accurate aggregate counts of casualties in previous rounds of fighting, but during the current war, the level of damage to health infrastructure has caused the ministry to have to change its methodologies from a central reporting system to a scrape of social media and reports from families, rendering aggregate numbers more questionable. The issue from an information operations point of view, however, is not the precision of the overall count. No one disputes that civilian casualties have been high. Because the Health Ministry does not distinguish between combatant and non-combatant casualties, its use by journalists drives a distorted discussion of the proportion of civilian and combatant casualties. Moreover, because the Health Ministry is controlled by Hamas, it can issue disinformation at critical moments. For example, the ministry was quoted by journalists as stating that 500 civilians had been killed at a hospital by an air strike, with much subsequent confusion, when in reality a Palestinian rocket had harmed a smaller number of civilians at the site. Israel has been quick to use the many inconsistences in Health Ministry data to try to undermine its credibility. These efforts have failed, however, because there is no alternative data source. The IDF has not endeavoured to release its own estimates, nor to proactively explain civilian casualties. Indeed, when the IDF releases assessments of combatant casualties, they tend to contrast these with the aggregate casualties reported by the Health Ministry, despite also arguing that this same source is inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another sustained issue has been the use of mobile phones and the internet by IDF personnel. This has caused problems, for example during prisoner detention. In some areas, the IDF detained a significant number of people. Given that Hamas fighters were wearing civilian clothes without distinguishing markers, and that there were civilians still in the areas being contested – some of whom participated in the fighting – distinguishing between combatants and non-combatants was challenging. This required individuals to be detained and processed. In view of the fact that Hamas has a long history of using IEDs to target Israeli soldiers, and noting the widespread practice by Islamic State of seeding suicide bombers into surrendering groups, the IDF took to requiring those being detained to strip. Several problems emerged. Detainees were not allowed to dress immediately after being verified as unarmed. They were also filmed while being processed. The fact that large numbers of troops have cameras on the modern battlefield, combined with a growing cultural tendency to film a wide variety of events, means that the filming of detainees has become quite common. Where reservists or recently mobilised civilians are in the battlespace, this is even more widespread. Indeed, poor discipline by some IDF personnel has done significant harm after being filmed and released publicly. Nevertheless, there are two lessons to be drawn. First, the uncontrolled use of mobile phones to film and release information can be highly damaging. Second, while UK and other NATO doctrine for dealing with captured persons exists, it is not clear that the procedures are well rehearsed when required at scale. The processes for managing an unanticipated large number of captured persons also bring with them significant disinformation risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be noted that there are peculiarities to this conflict that make it an especially difficult context within which to conduct effective information operations. Globally, there is an animated audience in favour of both parties, and consequently, the actors directly involved have less agency in crafting perceptions. Instead, information is liable to be interpreted in the least favourable light by supporters of each side, and these individuals then amplify the worst interpretation available to their own communities. Within Israel, there is a prevailing sense that the battle is not worth contesting and that the vehemence of Western policymakers in directing Israel to pursue or refrain from particular courses of action is largely driven by the level of domestic political pressure they feel, rather than by any sustained conviction as to how the situation might be improved. This despondency does not help shape the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vii-humanitarian-support-operations&quot;&gt;VII. Humanitarian Support Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the conflict, Gaza’s habitability was already weak. Gaza urbanised rapidly during the 20th and early 21st centuries, and its population growth outstripped the resource-constrained municipality’s ability to provide essential services for residents. Urban planning has been poor, and the infrastructure supplying potable water and power has lacked either resilience or redundancy. This was exacerbated by Hamas’s use of construction materials for military purposes, which led the IDF to sustain the blockade of the Gaza Strip and limit access to dual-use materials. The IDF did have extensive surveillance and databasing of information regarding the civilian population, but given the lack of physical presence in the Gaza Strip in the years leading up to 2023, and the fact that these capabilities were security oriented and had not been intended or optimised for humanitarian work, these needed to be supplemented with dedicated humanitarian mechanisms that could operate multilaterally and integrate different NGOs, international agencies and Israeli government entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the size of the population and the disruption caused by the conflict, a large volume of supplies soon became necessary. This need was exacerbated by damage to Gaza’s infrastructure, with bottled drinking water needing to be brought in. Initially, flows into Gaza were disrupted by Israel’s desire to isolate it and the declaration of a total siege. At the political level, the siege became a point of discussion relating to leverage over the release of hostages, with Hamas threatening to execute hostages in response to strikes. This initial measure, taken in the aftermath of 7 October, was counterproductive and was quickly reversed under international pressure. However, once aid was allowed into Gaza in principle, ensuring a sufficient volume could enter Gaza remained challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once IDF forces began to operate inside Gaza, the main constraint on flows of humanitarian aid became the inspection of shipments to prevent Hamas rearming. The rate at which aid entered was around 70 trucks per day during the early phases of the operation, a number clearly inadequate to support the population. It then rose to 140 trucks per day early in 2024 and at the time of writing was between 300 and 400 trucks per day. These remain lower in number than aid flows prior to the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most contentious part of the inflow of trucks was who to trust to search for incoming military materiel destined for Hamas. Given that Hamas moved large quantities of weaponry into Gaza prior to the war, Israel is wary of those who have previously managed crossings and inspections. This mistrust arguably led to relatively poor coordination with organisations endeavouring to move materiel into Gaza. Aid agencies, for example, reported uncertainty as to what constituted dual-use items that would be prevented from moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways in which the process for getting aid into Gaza could be improved. Most of these are highly context specific, however. For the purposes of this paper, the area of friction in humanitarian operations that has the broadest relevance is the distribution of aid. This has been complicated by the close proximity of Hamas positions to civilian objects, which means that almost any part of Gaza is necessarily adjacent to sites from which attacks could emanate. Thus, separating areas of military operation from areas for humanitarian operations has proven complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, simply allowing humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza has also presented challenges. First, where the need has been greatest, desperation has driven violence around aid distribution centres, such that protection for humanitarian workers has been advisable. Even where more orderly processes emerged, this did not mean all was well. The theft of supplies by Hamas to sustain their own forces is clearly an issue of interest to the IDF. Separately, control over food is a vector for exerting control over the population. Since one of Israel’s goals in the war is to supplant Hamas’s control over the population, it goes directly against Israeli war aims to allow Hamas to exert control over aid distribution. Further complications have arisen in Israel with aid being attacked by Israeli citizens in protest. It is notable that the IDF has been less active in preventing this kind of disruption to supply. The point here is that while it might be desirable to leave humanitarian activity to humanitarians and thereby impose some separation between the IDF and the civilian population, in practice, the IDF has had to be heavily involved in the protection and distribution of aid in Gaza. Even where humanitarians were leading at the point of delivery, their movements had to be deconflicted from IDF manoeuvre and fires plans. Another complicating factor was the requirement for the IDF to use military engineering to restore some services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An enduring challenge for the IDF was that distribution of aid could be taken over by Hamas and used to maintain control over the local population, thereby preventing the implementation of one of Israel’s war aims. However, if the IDF took over distribution, the distribution point would also become a target for attack, to which the IDF would respond, risking the lives of civilians in the ensuing crossfire. There was also the risk that desperate people would end up in confrontations with soldiers who would use force in self-defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another element of the humanitarian situation has been the impact on health infrastructure and its coordination. First, the IDF at several points during large troop movements cut access to the internet and phone network in Gaza to limit Hamas’s ability to report on its movements. This made military sense. It also collapsed the coordination of medical services during these periods. The IDF therefore came under significant international pressure to restore these services. The impact on health infrastructure of the fighting in Gaza has been devastating and will be long lasting. The IDF took care not to fire directly on functioning hospital buildings, which have protected status. However, as hospitals became isolated, they also ceased to function. Thereafter, Hamas occupied and operated from some hospital sites, such as Al-Shifa. At this point the hospital lost its protected status and ground operations in and around the area destroyed it. This is to some extent analogous to the international coalition bombing the hospital building in Mosul because it had ceased functioning as a medical facility and was being held by Islamic State fighters. While such actions may be legal, the long-term consequences of the destruction of a healthcare facility are severe. Moreover, alternative provision of medical care was not readily available, even as supplies of medicine necessary to keep the facilities running were disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is reasonable to conclude that the IDF have made attempts to address the humanitarian issues, while continuing to pursue their military objectives. But none of the measures taken have been successful in preventing significant harm to the civilian population. Conditions in Gaza for civilians remain very poor as regards sanitation, the ability to move beyond areas of active fighting, and access to food and healthcare. The lesson here for militaries observing the conflict is cautionary. Many of the demands placed on the IDF by humanitarian organisations are incompatible with achieving the military tasks which they have been assigned. These conflicting imperatives remain messy and complex and have in the long run proven very damaging to the IDF politically. Learning from and improving methods for the provision of humanitarian assistance in urban warfare, where fighting will remain close to sensitive sites, is a challenge worthy of further consideration by the British Army and other militaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the lessons identified by the IDF from the conflict in Gaza have direct relevance to other militaries. Nevertheless, there are observations that have specific salience for the British Army from the conflict that are not as significant for the IDF. It must also be acknowledged that there are particularities of the fighting in Gaza that are context specific. In parallel to their internal lessons learned process, the IDF has also had to establish an unlearning process to avoid tactical adaptations in Gaza being carried to the northern border with Lebanon, where some would be dangerous. One distinct characteristic of the fighting in Gaza is that Hamas – unlike Hezbollah – has no effective artillery. This has given the IDF rear-area security for their enablers and has also meant that units have been able to concentrate in a way that troops in other theatres, such as Ukraine, have found perilous. For the British Army, which must be ready to fight Russia to effectively contribute to NATO’s deterrence posture, capabilities must be aimed at maximising the ability to concentrate effects without concentrating forces. To this end, the levels of dispersion of Israeli mixed UAV and ATGM armed companies may be highly instructive as to the force density required to effectively screen urban terrain. But the levels of dispersion of Israeli infantry are less indicative of what would be viable in a conflict with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another fundamental difference between IDF operations in Gaza and most other theatres – including Israel’s northern border with Lebanon – is the IDF’s total dominance in the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). On the northern border, where Hezbollah has been using one-way attack UAVs and other capabilities to strike Israeli positions, the need for electronic protection has produced such a cluttered EMS that the IDF has had to revert to printed maps, rather than depend entirely on digital map interfaces. For the British Army, given the extent of Russian electronic warfare, the battlespace management challenges that have emerged on Israel’s northern border are potentially more instructive than how centralised C2 has been conducted in Gaza. Unit boundaries and control measures remain relevant, but the blue force tracking possible in Gaza cannot be ensured in a highly contested EMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further consideration is the scale of the enemy force. Hamas predominantly operated in small groups of two to five personnel, with five or so groups often attacking within the same area. Hamas rarely concentrated above platoon strength. Although its 40,000 fighters make a sizeable force, the scale of its operations after 7 October was extremely limited. For the British Army, it is in some respects more useful to consider itself in Hamas’s position: defending urban areas with a coastline to the rear against a numerically superior enemy operating at divisional scale. It is the ability to effectively blunt Russian forces that is at the heart of the Land Operating Concept and thus the British Army’s contribution to NATO’s deterrence posture. Viewed from this perspective, some distinct lessons come into stark relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foremost observation of relevance to the British Army is the decisive role played by firepower in determining initiative during the fighting in Gaza. Ultimately, the superiority in responsiveness and organic lethality of IDF units made it costly for Hamas to mount attacks, and the larger the force it endeavoured to bring to bear, the higher the cost of any given action. Furthermore, while indirect fire prevented Hamas from concentrating its forces, the limited organic lethality of its teams meant that once they engaged IDF troops, they were quicky suppressed and thereafter destroyed. In many wargames, the British Army currently avoids confronting its diminishing tactical lethality by drawing on fires or capabilities held at the highest echelon represented in the scenario. In a war, however, these echelons would have other lines of effort to support, and these fires cannot be allocated to multiple targets. The lesson is clear. Firepower at the tactical level matters a great deal. The risk for the British Army is that the Land Operating Concept’s conclusions are not funded, so that while British troops may be trained to fight like the IDF, they find themselves equipped to die like Hamas. Increasing the British Army’s organic lethality at echelon should therefore be a high priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second important lesson for the British Army is the criticality of air defence to maintaining a position in an urban space. Hamas’s lack of ability to threaten Israeli aircraft and ISR meant that it was unable to concentrate and lacked freedom of manoeuvre. Once its defensive strong points were identified, they could be reduced. The weight of munitions deliverable from the air outweighs anything deliverable from artillery systems, such that many of the defensive advantages of urban terrain can be bypassed if it is possible to conduct precision bombing from medium altitude. The ability to operate from an urban environment, therefore, requires air defences, whether ground based or delivered through offensive and defensive counter-air patrols. In a major conflict, the density of enemy air defences means that the availability of counter air patrols may be extremely constrained. Thus, it seems clear that for the British Army to fight competitively on the ground, it must be able to hold enemy fast air at risk when flying at medium altitude. This lesson also reflects experiences in Mosul, Raqqa and throughout Ukraine. In Mosul, the ability of coalition fast air to enable Iraqi units to level defended positions fixed Islamic State to defend where they could not be detected. In Ukraine, whenever the Russian air force has established access at medium altitude near an urban settlement, it has rapidly destroyed it, enabling subsequent capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third lesson is that the relationship between offence and defence in the urban environment is micro-tactical. If the enemy can get around a flank, dislodging it requires attack into urban spaces, accompanied by its associated complications. For this reason, slowing the pace of enemy manoeuvre through urban terrain is critical to enable repositioning and preventing the defence from becoming unhinged. The most effective tool for this purpose is counter-mobility support. This is critically lacking in the British Army and is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The freedom a force gains from air defence and counter-ISTAR allows it to manoeuvre in the urban environment, and manoeuvre is critical to urban operations. The force density required to hold a specific piece of urban terrain means that most armies will need to choose which parts of a city they contest at any given time. Furthermore, not all urban terrain is equal. The significance of Wadi Gaza and other movement corridors that, once controlled, limited Hamas’s ability to resupply or redeploy was disproportionate. Control of the rural–urban interface is necessary to sustain a force within an urban stronghold. Sensitive sites such as hospitals also have a significant shaping effect on the tempo and scope of urban manoeuvre. A city should not be examined as a homogeneous environment. It is critical that terrain assessments identify seams and vulnerabilities in a defence that can be exploited to move without having to directly confront prepared enemies in defensive positions. Careful planning can turn an urban space against the defender. To enable manoeuvre in ways that are not canalised by urban planning, there is a need for a high density of engineers. This spans mobility support, breaching, explosive ordnance search and clearance, and engineering reconnaissance. It must also be supported by a critical mass of relevant engineering platforms. The notion that a force can do without these enablers is a non-starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Army must consider how it conducts battlespace management in urban environments. Deconfliction of boundaries in urban spaces requires different tactics, techniques and procedures to fire control outside the urban environment, because an enemy will often be placed between friendly units, and reduced ranges mean that fire may carry through into friendly units. There is therefore an increased likelihood of friendly fire and combat accidents. Training that disproportionately focuses on small arms rather than heavy weapons can exacerbate this problem. If troops do not have an intuitive appreciation for how backblast, for example, is redirected in urban spaces, they will suffer combat accidents. Procedures for blue force tracking must account for the transition from mounted to dismounted patrols and must be pushed across unit boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of fire in urban terrain results in different echelons having overlapping responsibilities, because the distances between echelons is compressed. High-payoff targets are therefore hunted in the same battlespace that tactical ISR and strike assets endeavour to find and strike dynamic targets. This leads to different rules of engagement – divided by target – in the same area of responsibility. Given the scaling of targeting that takes place in a major conflict, there is a significant risk that errors will be introduced if targets shift between targeting processes. The ability to explain how the force applies fire is important to ensure compliance with IHL, but also to set expectation among civilians in the environment about risk, and to shape the information environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more lessons to be learned from the Gaza conflict, but at this juncture, it is necessary to allow more time to elapse for the relevant details to be releasable and therefore available for analysis. This paper is, therefore, a starting point for the analysis, rather than a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oNLM1Aq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（10日）踏入第50日審訊。早前的審訊透露有被告參與西貢行山試槍及炸彈。被告李家田供稱，獲黃振強要求陪他到西貢行山時，雖然感到奇怪，但為免得罪黃而失去資助，故答應對方。李表示行山中途各人停下，他被吩咐站遠點，期間沒有聽到槍聲或爆炸聲。李否認辯方所指，當日應黃要求視察吳智鴻等人是否真的試槍。另外，李表示小隊成員沒有同意過示威期間用槍對付警察。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李家田稱錄影會面期間驚慌-擔心說話唔啱聽未能滿足警察&quot;&gt;李家田稱錄影會面期間驚慌 擔心說話「唔啱聽」未能滿足警察&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第四被告李家田第三日作供，李指出錄影會面中的答案，部分屬事實，部分屬警方要求，部分屬他自行虛構。李表示，被捕時遭警方武力對待後，在錄影會面期間心情驚慌，擔心說話「唔啱聽」、「滿足唔到警察」，或令母親承受與他一樣的武力對待。他同時希望順從警方要求，令對方遵守承諾批准保釋。李亦指，他沒有使用警方在其家中檢取的綠色斜孭袋，用作盛載手槍，因自己根本無保管過手槍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，在案件第二次提堂時，他有向法庭投訴遭警員武力對待，警方亦有跟進事件。但其後警方卻發信指由於法庭正處理其案件，因此投訴調查需暫停。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱對黃振強邀請行山感奇怪-為免得罪對方失資助故答應&quot;&gt;李稱對黃振強邀請行山感奇怪 為免得罪對方失資助故答應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後到辯方進行盤問。代表張俊富的大律師李國輔問，是否同意群組後期改名為「逃龍小隊」，李家田表示有聽過，但不知道是否因小隊經常被速龍追趕。另外，李同意當成員在「滅龍」群組討論槍械訓練時，張並沒有參與討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表張銘裕的大律師姚本成問及，李是否在荃灣示威行動中認識張銘裕，俗稱「不打不相識」；李同意。李確認在2019年11月16日去西貢行山之前，雙方並沒有單獨聯絡，直至行山當晚張致電李。張於11月18日再向李發訊息指：「搵間房入去鎖門瞓覺」，李表示以其理解，張以為李仍在理大。當日至12月8日，兩人再沒有單獨聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方亦問及李與其他涉案者的關係。李表示獲黃振強要求陪他到西貢行山，但最後由張銘裕代替。李表示，黃沒有解釋行夜山的原因，對於他邀請自己去行山雖感奇怪，但為免得罪黃而失去資助，故答應對方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱沒有聽到槍聲或爆炸聲-否認應黃要求視察&quot;&gt;李稱沒有聽到槍聲或爆炸聲 否認應黃要求視察&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李同意行山時，沒有人向他介紹同行的吳智鴻、彭軍壕、賴振邦及許湛榮，因此不認識上述4人。李不同意辯方指，吳表示不需要張提供的柴油，張遂倒掉。李表示中途各人停下，張吩咐他「行開啲」，但並非「睇水」。李於是走開，並繼續行5分鐘，但沒有聽到5下槍聲。張其後第二次叫停李，再次著他「行開啲」，期間沒有聽到爆炸聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，實際上黃振強吩咐李去視察吳等人是否真的試槍及炸彈；李不同意。李亦表示，黃沒有吩咐他取手槍。事後李沒有主動匯報行山情況，黃亦沒有過問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方問及李與黃振強的關係，他同意8月5日在荃灣認識黃。李表示9月底至10月開始向黃索取資助，由10月至11月對方共提供約5千元。李得知黃有金主，因此沒有問資金來源。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱成員沒有承認黃為隊長-亦無同意用槍對付警察&quot;&gt;李稱成員沒有承認黃為隊長 亦無同意用槍對付警察&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示，從來沒有人稱呼或承認黃是隊長，他亦沒有獲「屠龍」成員授權作為代表，去面對傳媒、進行眾籌，以及與吳智鴻那夥人交涉。在行山之前，黃沒有提及認識有人可提供槍或炸彈對付警察。李又指，不知道黃所說的「新Plan」與舊有的「眼鏡Plan」是甚麼，他並沒有交代過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對話顯示黃於12月6日曾私下向吳索取手槍，表示想自行使用。李表示不知情，又指小隊成員沒有同意過示威期間用槍對付警察。李續指，無聽過黃說行動後要「走佬」，亦無聽過他說事成後可獲一百萬，黃也沒有吩咐隊員收拾東西。對話顯示，行動前仍有人問「其實我哋會做邊個Plan？」，李同意隊員之間沒有共識。李最後同意，不知道12月8日的行動內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（11日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今日（10日）處理第四批共9名被告求情，包括參選九西的毛孟靜、岑子杰、何啟明、馮達浚、黃碧雲、劉澤鋒；參選超區的岑敖暉、王百羽；及參選衞生服務界的余慧明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;清晨5時半，西九龍裁判法院外已有40人排起長龍，自備雨傘、折凳等輪候入場旁聽。排在隊伍前列的，包括曾參與超區初選，被裁定罪脫、律政司亦無提上訴的李予信。戴鴨舌帽、穿白色上衣和短褲的李，排在隊伍約第5位。他表示因為知道有排隊黨，今凌晨約1時攜露營椅和乾糧到場。李說有密切留意早前的求情聆訊，至於今天為何到場，他表示：「唔講太多點解，淨係想過嚟，想喺度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何啟明友人讚默默支持弱勢社群&quot;&gt;何啟明友人讚「默默支持弱勢社群」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明的教會朋友李先生，今晨約5時到場，他認識何逾20年，形容他在深水埗區多年是「好好嘅議員」，很多事情親力親為，甚至會親自執老鼠。李先生又指，何辭任區議員後仍然服務社區，形容他「唔係一個身分先做嘢，係本身人品都會一直默默去支持弱勢社群」，也與基督信仰的精神「貫徹如一」。李說望親身入庭，對被囚禁的人表達支持。對於刑期長短，他坦言不到他考慮，「有啲嘢你都控制唔到，諗嚟都無謂，諗啲可以控制到嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被告友讚好有原則&quot;&gt;被告友讚「好有原則」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中一名被告的朋友阿修今晨約8時到場，表示「想見一個朋友」。他指認識該被告7年，形容他「好有原則」、有時甚至「好惡」，會很執意解決朋友矛盾，笑言他「好難相處」、「通常啲矛盾都喺佢度嚟」，但也有他的優點：「佢會好講件事公唔公平。」阿修又讚這位朋友「好識煮嘢食」，最深刻是他曾煮過清酒煮花甲，二人又會一起打牌，新年時看《喱咕喱咕新年財》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阿修說，與該被告現已沒什麼聯繫，但從其他朋友口中，聽到他為人比以前平靜，推斷以他的性格「已準備好面對佢要面對嘅嘢」，希望「有機會一齊食嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;市民希望佢哋知道仲有好多人記住&quot;&gt;市民：希望佢哋知道仲有好多人記住&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;莫小姐於早上約8時到達，表示希望支持被告，特別記掛岑敖暉、毛孟靜、余慧明等人，指在2019年運動時看到岑「瘦咗好多」，想看看他現在的情況。莫在初選47人案首度提堂、裁決日、求情聆訊等也有來旁聽，「希望佢哋知道仲有好多人出面記住佢哋。」自認「姜糖」的莫小姐帶同印有姜濤頭像的扇到場，被問到有哪首歌鼓勵她，她笑說「冇諗過」，想了想後選擇了《濤》：「雖然19年運動唔成功，但都激起個浪濤，起碼全世界都知道香港發生咩事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;初次來旁聽的阿T（化名）則表示，47人只是在「行使公民權利」，認為否決財政預算案是《基本法》賦予的權利，讓議員能監察政府運作，如今的指控為「莫須有」。他認為過往立法會內存在太多利益輸送，導致許多工程以嚴重超支、大白象收場，當初47人提出的方法能改變議會。阿T不滿稱現在的財委會「好垃圾」，「幾分鐘就批八十幾億啊、一百億咁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（10日）處理第四批共9名被告求情，包括參選九西的岑子杰、毛孟靜、何啟明、馮達浚、黃碧雲、劉澤鋒；參選超區的岑敖暉、王百羽；及參選衞生服務界的余慧明。毛孟靜一方望以監禁5至6年為量刑起點。辯方指，毛孟靜對否決預算案有保留、私下反對「攬炒」，亦非組織者，她明白對公眾造成的潛在危害，望真誠道歉，並可與丈夫度過餘下時光。毛亦獲前立法會議員石禮謙、融樂會等撰求情信，提到她政見不同仍願交流，及為少數族裔貢獻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明一方則望判監3年或以下。何獲前民協主席馮檢基等撰求情信，指他熱心服務弱勢社群。辯方指何出於良好動機、具高尚目的而犯案，他望令香港變得更好，只是採用了非法手段；而他被捕後持續服務社區，包括跟進保育深水埗主教山配水庫，本案後打算遠離政治，專注教會事奉。辯方又提及，何本質上是一名好人，法官陳仲衡即指，不認為本案有任何被告本質上是一個壞人，多名被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被告分兩排就坐-毛孟靜做心心飛吻&quot;&gt;被告分兩排就坐 毛孟靜做心心、飛吻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪、周天行、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋。岑子杰由大律師郭憬憲代表，毛孟靜和岑敖暉由大律師黃雅斌代表，何啟明由大律師阮偉明代表，馮達浚由資深大律師祁志代表，黃碧雲由大律師沈士文代表，劉澤鋒由大律師黃錦娟代表，余慧明由大律師石書銘代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;各被告於約10時步入法庭，男女被告分成上下兩排，由6名懲教隔開就坐。此前獲保釋、其後被裁罪成的何啟明，戴眼鏡、穿深灰色短袖上衣，看到旁聽席後不住雀躍微笑揮手。黃碧雲則穿有橙色圖案的深藍色上衣，微笑揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於其餘被告均還柙逾3年，毛孟靜紮髻，穿黑色連衣裙、卡其色針織長外套，站起向旁聽席張望，又雙手放頭做心形手勢和飛吻。紮起馬尾的余慧明同樣穿黑色上衣、卡其色外套，向親友揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑敖暉穿米白色上衣，外穿深啡長袖裇衫、牛仔褲；王百羽穿開胸白色長袖裇衫、露出內裡的黑色內衣，大幅度揮手；戴白色口罩的岑子杰，穿黑色Polo上衣，身形較健碩；馮達浚穿深藍色摺至中袖的裇衫、繫藍白斜間領帶，微笑望向旁聽席；劉澤鋒穿白色裇衫、戴淺藍色口罩。何啟明、岑子杰、王百羽等人，也與旁聽席做手勢和口型溝通。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;罪脫的李予信、毛孟靜的丈夫、前立法會議員邵家臻、前沙田區議員李志宏、前民陣召集人陳皓桓、社民連陳寶瑩等均有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱毛孟靜質疑否決財案倡以5至6年為起點&quot;&gt;辯方稱毛孟靜質疑否決財案、倡以5至6年為起點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;毛孟靜一方先進行求情。代表毛孟靜的大律師黃雅斌同意，毛在初選勝出後報名參與立法會選舉，接受她有一定程度的參與，建議以5至6年為量刑起點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃強調，毛從不曾向人施壓、或譴責不跟隨涉案謀劃的人，亦曾質疑否決預算案的需要；毛現時已反省，明白對公眾可能造成的潛在危害，她真誠道歉和有悔意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;石禮謙融樂會等撰求情信-毛望與丈夫度過餘下時光&quot;&gt;石禮謙、融樂會等撰求情信 毛望與丈夫度過餘下時光&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂呈上多封求情信，包括其大學同事、街坊、學生等，讚揚她真誠關心弱勢社群。其中前立法會議員石禮謙表示，即使政治立場與毛孟靜不同，但毛總是願意交流意見，以制訂政策，對香港整體有利。服務少數族裔的非牟利機構融樂會，則指毛利用立法會的機制和資源更好地保障少數族裔，又設立首個針對少數族裔議題的委員會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;毛的政治助理則指，在初選前後均重複聽到毛表示反對否決預算案，認為只是政治姿態、他們亦不夠票，若否決預算案，便無法建學校和醫院。辯方強調，毛孟靜視立法會為能為社區做正面的事的地方，她對參與本案串謀感到後悔，並於今年1月撰信對其參與真誠道歉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃指，毛孟靜現年67歲，她在任職立法會議員前，曾長年從事傳媒行業，其後從事教育。其丈夫亦撰信，辯方指其丈夫有一些個人情況，但不便公開，並指毛非常希望能與丈夫度過餘下的時光。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;去年有報導指，毛孟靜的英籍丈夫、八旬資深傳媒人 Philip Bowring 因肺炎入住醫院深切治療部近3周，他其後出院。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官關注曾獲諮詢意見-辯方指毛非組織者&quot;&gt;官關注曾獲諮詢意見 辯方指毛非組織者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡主動引毛的求情信，提及明白到自己透過只是私下反對「攬炒」和相關政治行動，成為了串謀的共犯，她要承擔後果。陳問毛是否即指，她因沒有公開反對「攬炒」而成為共謀者？黃否認，指承認毛有參與串謀，但有人可以意圖參與串謀的同時，也對計劃有所保留，強調其悔意屬真誠。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又強調，根據求情信、毛過往的經歷、對立法過程的真誠關注，她有可能不會真的否決預算案。法官陳慶偉和李運騰關注，戴耀廷曾就初選的合法性諮詢毛的意見，法官陳仲衡亦認為，因此不能視她對法律無知，黃則回應，毛從來不是涉案謀劃的組織者或推動者。法官陳慶偉亦提到，毛曾提到尋求國際線協助，黃回應這與本案控罪無關；又重申毛公開所說和私下的意見有所不同，現時已有真誠悔意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指何啟明是好人-官同意本案被告非壞人&quot;&gt;辯方指何啟明是好人 官同意本案被告非壞人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後由何啟明一方陳詞。代表何啟明的大律師阮偉明先表示，望說服法庭，何啟明本質上是一個好人（by nature a good man）。法官陳仲衡即指，不認為本案有任何被告本質上是一個壞人。岑敖暉、何啟明、黃碧雲、馮達浚等聞言發笑，岑子杰亦用力點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阮偉明續呈上9封求情信，來自何的父母、兄弟、女友、校長、神學院教授、朋友及前民協主席馮檢基。阮表示，何自小已有愛心、關愛他人，是個照顧弟弟的哥哥，他出身草根、在基督教學校受教育，成為一名虔誠的基督徒，並以其基督精神，積極幫助貧窮和有需要人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阮續指，何大學畢業後於2015年加入民協，因民協的願景與他一致，即為弱勢社群爭取利益和服務社區。阮又呈上何的 Facebook 專頁截圖，指何在2020年立法會選舉延期、2021年因本案被捕後，仍繼續爭取保育深水埗主教山配水庫，直至該配水庫獲評為一級歷史建築，強調他持續服務社區，並非為競選而做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指何被捕後仍服務社區獲馮檢基撰求情信&quot;&gt;辯方指何被捕後仍服務社區、獲馮檢基撰求情信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阮偉明又引用馮檢基的求情信，指馮是資深政治人物，作為2021年立法會選舉的候選人，是獲確認參選資格的「愛國者」，望法庭能考慮。馮信中提及，在何啟明2013年為民協工作時認識他，對何服務弱勢社群的熱情和投入印象深刻，指他的熱情不僅在於他所屬的社區，而是令整個香港成為更好的地方。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 馮檢基（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阮續指，何啟明在本案後打算遠離政治，並專注教會事奉，故過去數年開始在神學院修讀基督教研究碩士課程，並獲認識何近20年、與他關係親密如母子的牧師寫求情信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阮表示，本案屬非常嚴重的罪行，望法庭接納何啟明是一個好人，他犯案後有良好動機、高尚目的（honorable goal），只是採用了非法手段。阮又指，何希望成為立法會議員，令香港成為更好的地方，更好地服務社會。何已對其行為深切反省，不大可能重犯，指他不應承受長期監禁，認為3年或以下的刑期已足夠反映其罪責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，兩名超區參選人今（10日）午求情。庭上讀出岑敖暉親撰的求情信，他表示經過反思後，發現自己過去被憤怒充滿、參與政治並非完全出於良好和有建設性的意圖，對此深感後悔；他亦承認否決預算案會影響政府運作，從而危害國安，對違背公眾期望感到深深後悔和抱歉。岑又提到，與妻子分隔逾3年，但愛意無隨時間流逝而減退，反而日益深厚和強烈，「我現時內心每一刻最大的願望，就是回到我們一起建立的家，與她共度所有時光，這是我這個魯莽和愚蠢的人，對她無條件的愛和支持所能做的回報。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑敖暉求情信昔日言行被憤怒推動非全出於良好意圖&quot;&gt;岑敖暉求情信：昔日言行被憤怒推動、非全出於良好意圖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選超區初選的岑敖暉和王百羽先後求情。代表岑敖暉的大律師黃雅斌指，無意減輕岑的參與程度，並呈上街坊等求情信，指岑並非只喊口號、而是願意親力親幫助居民，而他現時已改過自新。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續讀出岑的求情信（英文全文見文末），岑提到他自還柙起，自願進行單獨囚禁，並視之為機會以投放時間反思及閱讀。岑自言被捕前，曾任社運人士多年，望能建立更公平、平等和自由的社會和政治體制，但經過仔細反思，他發現他政治參與背後的一些原因，「並非像他們看起來那樣光采」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑形容，他過去是被憤怒所充滿的人，更壞的是，憤怒有時演變成仇恨或怨恨，驅使他作出某些政治行為、修辭和言論。過去數年，他閱讀哲學、歷史、文學、靈性等著作，最重要是有他妻子的愛，他慢慢意識到憤怒，更莫說仇恨或怨恨，絕對不能將世界或他自己帶去任何地方——至少不能帶去任何美好、有建設性或充滿愛的地方。經過深切反省，他譴責（denounce）自己案發時的行為，包括參與涉案謀劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CsEdRJV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
▲ 岑敖暉（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑續指，他明白以否決預算案作為政治手段，不僅嚴重破壞、干擾和阻撓人們的生活，以及政府機關履行職能，亦會危害國家安全，亦離他當初的政治願景更遠。因此他譴責自己過去的言行，不僅在於違法，更重要是它們並非出於完全良好和有建設性的意圖，他對此深切後悔。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑與妻分隔3年-內心每刻願望回家共度時光&quot;&gt;岑：與妻分隔3年 內心每刻願望回家共度時光&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑表示，望向公眾造成的傷害深切道歉，包括其言行所造成的社會分裂和政治風險。他指，案發時作為頗具影響力的政治人物以及區議員，公眾寄望他會服務大眾，但其行為與該目的背道而馳。自還柙後，他無法再服務公眾，對那些寄望他為負責任公眾人物的人，「我令他們失望，為此我深深懊悔、後悔和抱歉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑最後指，與可愛的妻子分隔逾3年，「我的愛沒有隨時間流逝而減退，反而日益深厚和強烈」。岑形容，妻子是他反省生活和改過的動力，「我現時內心每一刻最大的願望，就是回到我們一起建立的家，與她共度所有時光，這是我這個魯莽和愚蠢的人，所能對她無條件的愛和支持的回報，雖然我這些年帶給她的憂傷、痛苦和寂寞是永遠無法彌補」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑表示，明白他犯下嚴重罪行，長期監禁是無可避免，「我願意接受我過錯所帶來的所有後果」，只望刑期不會剝奪他改過和向家人彌補過錯的機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;庭上讀出的岑敖暉求情信&quot;&gt;庭上讀出的岑敖暉求情信：&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am writing to express myself for the mitigation of HCCC70/2022 which I’ve pleaded guilty. Upon voluntary, I have been placed under solitary confinement since I was taken into jail custody, taking this as an opportunity to invest my time mainly on reflecting on myself and reading various aspects of materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to my arrest, I had been a political activist for years, with self-perceived goals of creating a more just, egalitarian and liberal society and political institution. Upon painstaking reflections however, I figured out some underlying causes of my political participation were not as bright as they may appear to be. I was a person filled with anger, worse still, anger sometimes evolved into hatred or resentments, which occasionally fuels or drives my political acts, rhetorics, and utterances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the past years, I became gradually aware of these aims with various philosophical, historical, literary and some spiritual readings and most importantly, with the love of my wife, I gradually realised that anger, not to mention hatred or resentment, could lead the world and myself to absolutely nowhere, at least nowhere bright, shining, constructive or loving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon deep reflection, I denounce the action undertaking at the material time, including but not limited to my participation to the scheme. I understand that had the budget been vetoed, the so called political means, not only the people’s livelihood and performances of the duties and functions discharged by the HKSAR government would be seriously interfered in, destructed, undermined, and hence endangering national security, also place nowhere near, if not further away from the aforementioned political vision. As such, I denounced the actions and utterances I had done, not merely because it breaches the law, but equally importantly, it was not made out of purely good and constructive intentions, I am deeply regretful and remorseful of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to apologise for the harm to public, especially for the great social political risk and ruptures created, I acknowledge my actions and utterances contribute to that and I deeply apologise. Moreover, having been quite an influential figure and district councillor at the time being, the public has placed hope upon me to serve the public. Not only did my action contradict with that purpose, since I was remanded in jail, I have not been able to continue to serve the public. To those who looked up to me as responsible public figure, I have let them down, and for that I am deeply remorseful, regretful and deeply apologetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been separated from my lovely wife for more than 3 years, my love did not fade gradually with the passage of time, but became deeper and stronger bit by bit daily. She has been my motivation of reflection, living and reform. The greatest wish at every single moment in my mind now, is to return to the home my wife and I build together, and to spend all my time with her. This is all this reckless and foolish man can return for her for her unconditional love and support, although the sorrow, pain and loneliness I brought to her for these years could never be compensated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that I committed a serious crime. I understand that an imprisonment with substantial length is inevitable, and I am willing to accept all the consequences brought about by my wrongful act. I just humbly pray the sentence would not deprive me of the opportunity to perform penance for my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，兩名超區參選人今（10日）午求情。辯方指，王百羽並非謀劃組織者，屬「積極參加者」，他還柙逾3年，體重減了20公斤，又患高血壓需服藥控制，望獲釋後繼續以專業服務社會。庭上讀出王百羽所撰的求情信，他感激家人不離不棄，形容他們是「天下間最好的父母」、「家人是我最珍視的寶物」，「我非常渴望能早日回家、擁抱家人，好好地盡孝道，孝順父母。」辯方讀出求情信和談及其家人時，王百羽雙眼通紅，數度以手和紙巾拭淚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方王百羽屬積極參加者&quot;&gt;辯方：王百羽屬「積極參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表王百羽的大律師黃俊嘉表示，王屬「積極參加者」，其罪責屬於高級別，但並非謀劃的組織或協調者，只是一名參與者。辯方指，王已深切反省，知道其行為屬不恰當，如再有機會，他並不會這樣做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，王來自勞動階層，於香港出生、長大，是家中第一名入讀大學的成員，其父母對他非常自豪，其母親今亦有到庭，給予兒子無條件支持。辯方指，王有貢獻社會的抱負，他畢業於科大計算機科學及工程學系，從事資訊科技工作，尹認為香港需要更多社區服務，故參與義工服務弱勢，並當選特首選委委員、港區全國人大代表選舉團成員，至2019年當選元朗區議員，會議出席率100%，為該區居民帶來改變，反映他的公共服務獲得認可。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，王兼顧繁重工作和社區服務，令他有巨大的精神和生理壓力，患有高血壓，至今仍需服藥控制；王亦對因本案而無法服務居民感到深深抱歉。王百羽聞言時點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;王百羽稱望及早回家盡孝-庭上落淚&quot;&gt;王百羽稱望及早回家盡孝 庭上落淚&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續讀出王百羽的求情信節錄，提及對家人的愛和感激。王表示：「家人是我最珍視的寶物⋯⋯我非常渴望能早日回家、擁抱家人，好好地盡孝道，孝順父母⋯⋯他們是天下間最好的父母，直到今天我的家人對我都仍不離不棄，我十分感激。疫情期間未能親自照料家人，只能獨自擔心卻無能為力，令我有很大的反思。看到他們能夠活得健康精神，是我現在最開心的事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IsL9rC0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
▲ 王百羽父親&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃俊嘉朗讀求情信時，王百羽眼眶通紅，不禁落淚，他一度用手揉眼睛，又拿出紙巾數度拭眼和鼻。黃續指，王百羽其中一名祖父母年近九旬，王望能好好照顧家人，王早前置業，但因本案未能負擔供樓開支，需由家人承擔，黃望為他所犯的過錯道歉，並向家人表達感謝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;還柙期間減20公斤&quot;&gt;還柙期間減20公斤&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後指，王已是一名改過的人，他還柙逾3年，減輕了20公斤，獲得珍貴的機會反省自我，並制訂將來的計劃。他沒有放棄原本的專業，一直留意最新的科技發展，望獲釋後繼續以其專業，以恰當和合法的方式服務社會，重犯機會輕微。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，辯方提及王真誠誤信謀劃為合法，但看畢3頁求情信，似乎看不到他有這樣說。法官李運騰亦指，辯方可提供王百羽在初選期間說過的話，以顯示他當時相信是合法。黃俊嘉稱會索取指示，遂押後至明天繼續求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，毛孟靜再向旁聽席以手臂做出心心手勢，何啟明則向律師表示：「唔該晒！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oO2fkId.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今處理參選九西初選的6名被告求情。代表馮達浚的資深大律師祁志表示，本案被告是法官「永遠不會在被告欄見到的人」，他們有學識、表達和思考能力高，並告訴法庭他們是出於良好動機而犯案。祁志形容，案發時24歲的馮達浚是年輕、熱心和幼稚的理想主義者，他畢業自拔萃男書院，望服務社區，而他成長於有多元辯論和選舉文化的香港，當時提出反對不僅合法，也是人們生活的基石，通識教育亦鼓勵人發問和思考，惟在《國安法》後，這樣的情況結束，爭取權力監察政權，一夜之間變成了顛覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方強調，馮案發時真誠相信謀劃合法，政府亦於《國安法》後逾半年才將他們拘捕，認為謀劃無對國安造成危害，望法庭按其參與程度判處較輕的刑期。辯方又引述馮所撰求情信，指自己還柙3年已反省和改變，他現時已不在意特首會否下台，並向他曾無禮對待的泛民致歉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方被告為民主社會領袖-望以和平手段服務社會&quot;&gt;辯方：被告為民主社會領袖 望以和平手段服務社會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;毛孟靜和何啟明一方完成求情後，由馮達浚一方求情。代表馮達浚的資深大律師祁志表示，在法官席前的案件獨特，是這個司法管轄區從未聽過的，本案被告是各法官「永遠不會在被告欄見到的人」，他們被指以非法手段尋求改變，望透過選票進入議會，並告訴法庭他們是出於良好動機犯案，是其他案件所沒有的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志續舉例，搶劫犯運用暴力手段偷竊，販毒者從他人痛苦賺取利益，危駕者為他人帶來巨大傷害；但法庭從逾百日的審訊和聆訊，會得知本案被告均是民主社會、或「相對民主社會」的領袖，他們真誠相信多元主義（pluralism），望以和平手段服務社會，是有學識、表達和思考能力高的人，馮達浚亦是其中之一，因此法庭的量刑並不容易。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方馮達浚為理想主義者望服務社區&quot;&gt;辯方：馮達浚為理想主義者、望服務社區&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志提到，馮達浚與他另外代表的袁嘉蔚一樣，是本案最年輕的被告之一，當中袁比馮年長，此時岑子杰和王百羽在唇邊舉起手指做出「shh」的手勢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志指，馮達浚案發時是一名24歲的理想主義者，他是一個「DBS boy」，畢業自拔萃男書院和浸會大學，從無隸屬任何政治組織。馮2014年受到雨傘運動觸動，其後開始服務九龍城社區，並於2019年參選區議員但失敗；惟他繼續懷有理想，為社區工作付出所有，他口中的「本土派」，是指對九龍城和九西社區工作的「本土」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方馮熱心幼稚真誠信謀劃合法&quot;&gt;辯方：馮熱心幼稚、真誠信謀劃合法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志指，馮達浚不是街頭抗爭者、也不暴力，只是一個熱心和幼稚的年輕人，望服務社區，盡力令他的聲音被聽見，真誠相信謀劃合法。但他能帶來影響的機會很微，他最終亦在初選被公眾所「拒絕」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cUAv35v.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;
▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志認為，法庭判刑時應合乎比例、避免壓迫性的刑罰；又指本案是以串謀罪而非《國安法》定罪，《國安法》第22條的三級刑期分級制不適用，法庭應按《刑事罪行條例》第159C條有關串謀罪的罰則，按串謀的嚴重性和危害來判刑，而本案串謀屬最輕微，馮的參與亦屬較低程度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方被告國安法後逾半年始被捕選舉延後無續危害國安&quot;&gt;辯方：被告國安法後逾半年始被捕、選舉延後無續危害國安&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志續指，法庭判刑時僅應考慮事實和實際後果、而非臆測和假設性的結果，而涉案謀劃不大可能成功，因能否取得35+、立會重選後能否再當選等均屬未知數。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志又指，若被告行為對國家安全有任何實質威脅，大可在《國安法》生效後不久將他們拘捕，但這期間政府沒有指各人違法，他們最終在6至7個月後才被捕，認為事實上涉案謀劃和被告並無對國安造成危害，馮達鴻參與串謀的時間短。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉打斷指，那是因為立法會正式選舉延期，惟祁志指，政府是稱因疫情而延後，而出於幸運，被告因此不能進一步危害國安，串謀的影響也停止，該「幸運」的利處應歸於被告。陳慶偉指他不同意，又提到根據庭上證供，戴耀廷此後還打算找香港民研做民調，謀劃沒有即時停止。祁志則重申，馮達浚的參與和造成的後果，在當刻已停止。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方馮成長於多元社會鼓勵公開辯論&quot;&gt;辯方：馮成長於多元社會、鼓勵公開辯論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志又提到，案情提及馮達浚在2020年6月26日的選舉論壇，在「對《國安法》有全面理解（with full appreciation of NSL)」下，表達對《國安法》的不滿。惟祁志強調，《國安法》條文於6月30日晚才頒布，由特首簽署生效，被告沒有水晶球、事前無人見過內容，社會只對可能有《國安法》感到恐懼，被告此前並不知道所做的行為是違法。即使《國安法》通過後，行政會議成員、資深大律師湯家驊也不肯定是否違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志指，馮達浚成長的香港社會，有多元辯論和選舉文化，提出反對不僅合法，也是港人生活和政治的基石；而香港有不同語言的報章，可從不同角度辯論政治議題，通識教育亦是教育制度重要一環，年輕人被訓練問問題，也被鼓勵思考和在公開及私下辯論。惟在《國安法》生效後，這樣的情況結束，爭取權力監察政權，一夜之間變成了顛覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;馮達浚求情信向泛民道歉-官一度問有否提悔意&quot;&gt;馮達浚求情信向泛民道歉 官一度問有否提悔意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志續指，馮達浚撰寫了6頁的中文求情信，形容他在法律界多年，從沒有看過如此準確和字體工整的求情信。當中馮表示已深切反省，不再談及政治。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡表示，他讀過求情信，問其信中有否提及悔意。祁志解釋，馮達浚並非空洞的道歉，而是在信中探索其內心，稱自己成為更冷靜的人。馮又提及2020年末決定不再參與選舉，而他還柙3年已經改變，現時已不在意特首會否下台，並望向他曾經非常不禮貌對待的泛民、他的團隊、家人等道歉，對困擾社會感到後悔，並感謝家人和他的貓的支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馮的母親亦指馮望貢獻社會，已經反省和改變。馮亦獲浸大新聞系前高級講師呂秉權和另一講師撰求情信，指他對干犯《國安法》感後悔，並嘗試理解整個圖畫，而非只聆聽單一聲音。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mwPpEZp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image20&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今處理參選九西初選的6名被告求情。代表黃碧雲的大律師沈士文指，黃的角色次要，沒有出席任何協調會議、無簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，她是在選舉論壇被激進派「逼到牆角」，受壓下才提及否決預算案，應屬「其他參加者」。辯方又引包括前運輸及房屋局局長張炳良等撰寫的求情信，指黃溫和、務實，屬「對抗式政治」的受害者，犯案與本性不符。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表劉澤鋒的大律師黃錦娟則指，劉生於廣州，熱心服務弱勢，參選是望服務他熱愛的社區，即香港和香港人，望考慮他為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」較低級別。辯方又指，劉在獄中沒有放棄自己，修讀會計課程，望將來繼續服務社區和長者，並引其好友寄語：「雨後會是天晴」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃碧雲受壓下始提否決-屬其他參加者&quot;&gt;辯方：黃碧雲受壓下始提否決 屬「其他參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲的大律師沈士文指，涉案謀劃在於當選後無差別否決預算案，惟能實現的機會很微。沈形容，黃碧雲的角色非常次要（peripheral），她並非組織者，並在社會氣氛熾熱時，從沒有親身出席任何協調會議、沒有簽署或支持「墨落無悔」聲明、政綱沒有提及否決預算案，亦從沒有公開表達對預算案的看法，而是專注在民生議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9Et26xI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image21&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黃碧雲（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，黃碧雲之所以被定罪，主要因法庭裁定時任民主黨主席胡志偉的言論可指證黃，以及她在選舉論壇的言論。惟沈指，黃在論壇被激進派強烈批評，被「逼到牆角（cornered）」後才表示會用盡憲制裡的權力，包括否決預算案。沈指黃的角色非常被動，她沒有提倡無差別否決，反而是避免（refrain）這樣做，片中可見她頗為緊張，受壓才提到否決，考慮她的政治背景和往績，懷有顛覆國家政權的意圖嚴重干擾阻撓政權機關運作，與她本性完全不符。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈又指，雖認為《國安法》第22條的三級罰則不直接適用本案，但考慮被告角色時仍可作參考，並認為黃的角色屬最低級，為「其他參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kS3FpxC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image22&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張炳良為黃碧雲撰求情信-稱屬對抗式政治受害者&quot;&gt;張炳良為黃碧雲撰求情信 稱屬「對抗式政治」受害者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就黃碧雲的背景，沈士文指，她於加州大學洛杉磯分校（UCLA）取得政治科學博士，2012至2020年任兩屆九西區立法會議員，2020年立法會選舉延期後沒有被DQ，但自願辭職，其後沒有再參與政治，黃亦曾於理工大學任多年講師。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方呈上前民主黨員、運輸及房屋局局長張炳良所撰的求情信，形容黃碧雲是2019年「對抗式政治（confrontational politics）」的受害者，捲入本案不符其性格。其他求情信亦指黃在社區及立法會工作獲得正面評價，對政治採取溫和、務實的做法，在撥款議案與政府合作，亦關心社區健康和福利事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WWOyGNR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前運輸及房屋局局長 張炳良&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈又提及，前特首曾蔭權於2010年提出政改方案，在功能組別增加5席「超級區議會」，議案在黃碧雲的支持下獲得通過，顯示她務實，望香港循序漸進實現民主化。黃亦曾於2015年揭發「鉛水事件」，曾召開記招要求政府成立獨立調查委員會徹查，對公共衞生等議題作出貢獻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈又提到，控方證人區諾軒曾發表一篇論文，提及民主黨認同「一國兩制」，支持香港回歸中國，並引黃碧雲為傳統民主派的例子。沈另提及，黃有2個定罪記錄，涉於2020年5月及10月擾亂立法會會議，黃被控違反《立法會（權力及特權）條例》，承認兩項藐視罪，共被判監4星期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指劉澤鋒參選為服務香港-屬其他參加或積極參加較低級&quot;&gt;辯方指劉澤鋒參選為服務香港 屬「其他參加」或「積極參加」較低級&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表劉澤鋒的大律師黃錦娟則指，劉生於廣州、來自草根家庭，案發時剛畢業於樹仁大學、近24歲，現年近27歲，一直投入義工和社區服務，是政治素人，參選是嘗試以他的知識服務他熱愛的社區，即香港和香港人。辯方望法庭考慮劉只是報名參加初選，簽署「墨落無悔」、參加選舉論壇和接受一些訪問，並於初選落敗，之後沒有再參與謀劃，其參與時間較短、角色輕微，認為劉屬「其他參加者」、最多是「積極參加者」較低級別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oAZjFLj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image24&quot; /&gt;
▲ 劉澤鋒（左）、余慧明（右）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續指，劉還柙至今逾3年，其家人今有到庭支持，認識他逾12年的友人、同學、牧師等亦撰求情信，指劉一直樂於助人、熱心服務弱勢，曾發起協助無家者的計劃，亦會探訪長者，為他們清潔家居。黃指，劉還柙至今逾3年並沒有放棄自己，他修讀中大的會計課程並取得不俗成績，望日後進修輔導、管理及運動治療等課程，望繼續以知識幫助別人和服務香港社會，尤其是長者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃最後引述劉澤鋒好友求情信，指劉曾提及在獄中，雨天時會感到比較舒服，好友寄語「雨後會是天晴」。黃提及，劉參與謀劃與其性格不符，他錯誤相信謀劃屬合法，望法庭能寬大處理，令劉能獲釋並看到雨後晴天。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;李家田稱被警方施行「水刑」 擔心母親同受苦故應要求背答案&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3WQfiOW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（9日）踏入第49日審訊。被告李家田供稱，警方上門拘捕時不斷追問他手槍下落，並多次施行「水刑」，用毛巾蓋着其臉再沖水，令他感覺遇溺及窒息。李擔心同住的母親會受到同樣對待，內心「淨係想保護我媽媽，唔想佢受呢啲苦」，故訛稱手槍由吳智鴻保管，並順從警員的要求，在錄影會面期間背出他們指示的答案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李家田稱沒有應黃振強要求前往灣仔單位-翌日得知對方被捕&quot;&gt;李家田稱沒有應黃振強要求前往灣仔單位 翌日得知對方被捕&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第四被告李家田第二日作供，他稱自己沒有出席11月25日的荃灣三陂坊會議。Telegram「滅龍」群組對話顯示，事前黃振強邀請大家出席，稱僅「食吓嘢」。李表示當時身處尖沙咀，認為眼前的事情較重要，因此沒有出席。另外，黃振強早前稱李於12月有出席何文田的媒體訪問。李今表示沒有出席，因當時去錯另一地址。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示，黃於12月7日要求他前往灣仔克街一單位。李知道「屠龍」成員會在示威前一日於附近租住地方睡覺，但他認為自己沒有需要，故不打算前往。他表示當晚到了太子某酒吧飲酒，因無錢結帳而在「滅龍」群組問可否借400元。對話紀錄顯示，黃振強轉賬了500元予李。黃於凌晨傳訊息催促李問：「瞓著啦，嚟未？」，李表示為了找藉口推搪黃，故稱「擺條鎖匙喺門口先」。李強調，當晚飲酒後返回新蒲崗工作室睡覺，翌日中午醒來，從新聞得知「屠龍」成員於克街的單位被捕，而張俊富在柴灣角街同被捕。李聞後感驚訝，因警方是上門拘捕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示，加入「屠龍」至被捕期間，並沒有打算與其他人串謀放炸彈、藉爆炸品導致爆炸，或串謀謀殺警務人員。他亦無管有槍械或彈藥。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱不滿政府委任懲教作特別警察-故用口號黑警死全家回應&quot;&gt;李稱不滿政府委任懲教作特別警察 故用口號「黑警死全家」回應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李其後解釋自己在 Telegram「滅龍」群組所發出的訊息。他於11月14日表示：「我聲援你哋」，並解釋當時「連登討論區」有帖文流傳，荃灣或葵芳有人死亡，有警察會去仁濟醫院「搶屍」，李不知消息真偽。群組內的成員「快樂的TT」表示「我殺去仁濟」。李解釋，由於自己不想前往，因此用藉口推搪並稱「我聲援你哋」。法官張慧玲一度問：「聲援唔係代表支持？點解變咗藉口？即係用把聲去援？」李解釋表達自己不想去現場的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李亦曾發訊息指：「黑警死全家」，他解釋當時政府公布委任懲教人員作為特別警察，李不滿警察想把其他紀律部隊「拖落水」、「拖埋入去社會事件」，因此套用示威口號「黑警死全家」回應此事。李強調：「我唔係好似字面咁解，想黑警死全家。」張官追問：「你唔係真係想啲警察死？」李回答：「正確。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李身處理工大學期間，一度發訊息指「啪隻老解」。他解釋指是回應黃振強所說：「快啲啪隻狗先」，當時黃著李盡快攻擊警察，但李卻不想這樣做，因此用藉口推搪稱「啪隻老解」，以表達想攻擊解放軍。黃及後回應：「啪老解做乜，啪狗呀」，李認為接不上話題，於是回應「直接返屋企瞓覺，舒服」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱套用我最期待的畫面迷因-問為何沒有槍械訓練&quot;&gt;李稱套用「我最期待的畫面」迷因 問為何沒有槍械訓練&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，當黃振強在群組發送軍訓內容後，李曾問：「我最期待的眼鏡訓練呢？」李解釋，他看畢軍訓內容後不見有槍械訓練，於是套用其中一個「網絡迷因（memes）」，即 TVB 劇集中的「我最期待的畫面出現了」一幕，希望詢問為何沒有槍械訓練。張官一度問甚麼是「網絡迷因（memes）」，李解釋一輪，指這些畫面被網民視為「好笑」。張官聽完解釋後表示：「我都唔明你講緊咩」，又追問李說這句話是否表達「好期待」。李不同意，強調自己並非真的期待槍械訓練。辯方一度希望展示該張「迷因」圖，但張官拒絕並指：「我唔需要知道呢個出處係咩。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱說話經包裝刻意引人笑-為免失資助故婉轉討論&quot;&gt;李稱說話經包裝刻意引人笑 為免失資助故婉轉討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，看清楚檔案後發現有槍械訓練，並問是否為期一天。黃回應：「眼鏡建基於體能，使用好眼鏡，體能係必須」，李回應：「我唔想變 John Wick 喎」，他解釋想表達自己不欲去軍訓。李補充，自己上述兩句話都透過修飾及包裝，目的「有心引人笑」。被問到為何不直接拒絕不願意的事情，李解釋因黃振強提供很多資助支援李的生活，包括請吃飯等，「我唔想失去呢個資助，所以我會用比較婉轉嘅方式，去參與群組入面嘅討論內容。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱被警員施行水刑-不斷吸入水感覺如遇溺&quot;&gt;李稱被警員施行「水刑」 不斷吸入水感覺如遇溺&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李其後談及被捕過程，他指於2020年6月11日早上，正於家中房間的電腦椅睡覺，突然房門「嘭」一聲被打開，李遂嚇醒，亦不知入房的是警員。警員5820隨即用手銬將李雙手鎖在背後，並將他推入廁所。偵緝警署警長馮保羅掌摑李的臉並問：「支槍喺邊？」李反問：「咩槍呀？」馮再掌摑李的臉數次，並對他大叫：「仲扮嘢？你係檸檬呀嘛。」李否認，馮隨即恐嚇李：「黃振強篤咗你出嚟啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後，警員5820不斷用拳頭打李的氣門，並問：「有冇呀？」馮則表示：「嗱，我哋依家想搵返支狗（槍）啫，因為依家唔對數」，李回答：「冇。」其後，警員5820及6314一同打李的腹部，警員6314更用軍裝長靴踢李的左腰間，並大叫：「仲扮嘢？冇呀喇？」毆打過程維持30至45分鐘。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馮則表示：「肯講未呀，依家我哋畀機會你，黃振強已經篤到你應一應，你講咗我哋就淨係告你支槍，如果唔係你就大鑊」，李回答：「冇。」戴「勞力士」錶的警員之後將毛巾放在李的臉上，並從後拉扯頭髮令其臉朝上。最後他對李施行「水刑」，即開花灑弄濕李臉上的毛巾。李在庭上表示：「嗰陣我嘗試唞氣，但因為（警員）沖水，我只係吸到啲水，我濁親係咁咳，就吸返啲水入去。」李形容當時感覺像遇溺：「我嗰陣覺得自己好似遇溺咁，身體反應係咁講。我完全吸唔到氣，只係吸水，情況好辛苦，覺得好似窒息咁樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施行「水刑」後，馮問：「講唔講？」李回答：「冇。」警員再次施行「水刑」，期間有人打李的腹部。他認為：「可能想我更加辛苦，吸更多水。」馮再度問：「講唔講？」李當時感到混亂，為想辦法令警員停止「水刑」，於是要求吸煙，警員最後將煙及火柴遞給李。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱擔心母親受同樣對待-故訛稱手槍由吳智鴻保管&quot;&gt;李稱擔心母親受同樣對待 故訛稱手槍由吳智鴻保管&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在李吸煙後，戴「勞力士」錶警員拍其膊頭表示「繼續」。馮再次恐嚇李：「諗清楚未呀？我要搵支槍啫，黃振強講晒你哋去西貢行山試槍嗰啲嘢出嚟啦，同鴻仔佢哋行呀嘛，知㗎喇。依家係唔對數啫。」李仍然表示沒有，警員6314再次對李施行「水刑」，李大叫：「唔好呀！」他在庭上嘆氣表示：「水刑真係好辛苦，我想叫佢哋停止」，「我講咗冇⋯⋯唔知點解講完之後，佢哋都要繼續咁做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，馮向他表示：「你知唔知依啲係恐怖份子，我而家喺度殺咗你都冇問題，就喺出面搵棵樹吊死你都得。」警員6314隨即大力扯李的頭髮迫他站起，並問：「你係咪想玩滾水淥啫啫？」手戴「勞力士」錶的警員則取出腰間的手槍，把子彈取出並放在李的手心上摩擦，並說：「依粒子彈而家有你指模，我可以話依粒子彈係喺你屋企搵到，到時你都係衰藏有軍火㗎咋，仲會連你阿媽都拉埋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;這時馮拿出自己的手槍，並在李手心摩擦說：「依家支槍有你指模，我可以話你搶槍，喺度開槍啪咗你都仲得。」馮更用槍指住李頭部說：「同樣嘅情況可以出現喺你阿媽身上。」李聞後感害怕，他解釋：「由佢哋（警員）入我間房之後，我都冇見過我阿媽，我唔知佢咩情況，好驚佢受到好似我咁嘅對待，佢會頂唔住。」他又指近60歲的母親為菲律賓籍，不太熟悉香港文化，不知她是否懂得處理這種情況。李因為不想母親有事，「淨係想保護我媽媽，唔想佢畀人拉、受呢啲苦」，最後「求其」訛稱：「支槍喺鴻仔度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱錄影會面部分答案屬警方要求部分屬虛構&quot;&gt;李稱錄影會面部分答案屬警方要求、部分屬虛構&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後馮打開電話中吳智鴻及黃振強的照片，其他警員亦展示不同人的照片，要求李記住。警員又要求李提供電話、iPad 等密碼。警員更教導李一些槍械的專用名詞，包括「扳機」及「上膛」。李又指，沒有警員押他到住所其他位置見證警方搜查，整個過程亦沒有看過搜查令。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，沒有說過警員記事冊上的警誡供詞，而簽名則是警員寫下所有說話後，李一次過簽署。李解釋，為免影響母親故順從警察，「佢哋叫我做乜我就做。」李稱其後被帶往落馬洲警署，馮要求他記熟稍後在警誡錄影會面的答案，包括要說黃振強為「屠龍」隊長、吳智鴻將槍交給李、李本人有參與試槍。及後李再被帶往上水警署，被警員指示在錄影會面背出剛才的答案，若不知道則自行虛構，李擔心再被施行「水刑」而答應。李表示，警員聲稱做得好可獲保釋，但最後對方沒有遵守。李感不開心但不敢投訴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指出錄影會面中的答案，部分屬事實，部分屬警方要求，部分屬他自行虛構。虛構的包括：李在試槍後保管手槍，最後應吳智鴻要求把手槍歸還；李主動表示要去試槍。而屬警方要求的說法包括：黃振強為「屠龍」隊長、試槍時各人曾輪流開槍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（10日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

Practical cooperation on sanctions and support for Ukraine has opened other possible avenues for collaboration. The new Labour government wants an ambitious structural alignment with the EU, but it is uncertain exactly what it could achieve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war on Ukraine has driven a better UK–EU working relationship, especially on Russian sanctions, diplomatic support for Ukraine, and coordinating military training programmes for Ukrainian recruits. This improvement is best illustrated by the resolution of the dispute over the Northern Ireland Protocol through the Windsor Framework. This has happened without any formal agreement on foreign, security and defence policy cooperation, which was omitted from the 2020 Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) that governs the post-Brexit UK–EU relationship. Indeed, the previous government was concerned over the potential “overstructuralisation” of cooperation with the EU on international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the new government has been vocal about a new UK–EU relationship and “reconnecting” with the continent after Brexit. Foreign Secretary David Lammy has designated the EU as his number one foreign policy priority, including structured foreign policy dialogues, which could lead to an ambitious “UK–EU security pact”. This reconnection has started immediately with the foreign secretary travelling to Berlin – key to unlocking better UK-EU relations and the target for a new bilateral defence and security treaty – within the first 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Defence Secretary John Healey wants a “UK–EU defence pact” as a “bespoke relationship” that could include UK third-party participation in EU military and civilian Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions and enhanced cooperation on “internal” security issues such as illegal migration, border control and terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-might-the-eu-think&quot;&gt;What Might the EU Think?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These collective propositions, alongside Labour’s UK–EU trade ambitions, bear some resemblance to Theresa May’s “dual pillar” proposals during Brexit negotiations. At the time, the EU did not enthusiastically respond, nor did it offer detailed counterproposals that would have superseded extant third-country arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU leaders and officials have been both welcoming and non-committal on closer UK–EU cooperation. The EU has a range of existing formal agreements with third countries, and the UK is unique in not having such a relationship. They conform to similar templates, and none are bespoke (excepting the US) along the lines that the Labour Party wants. The UK’s capabilities and prominent role in European security should give weight to a distinct relationship. However, beyond rhetoric from the EU’s leadership, there appears to be a lack of imagination and an absence of political will to conceive of a future relationship that would deliver maximum value and mutual benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-politics-are-getting-more-challenging&quot;&gt;The Politics are Getting More Challenging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of UK–EU relations, political conditions in London have stabilised at the exact same time as they have become more complicated in Brussels. As last month’s EU Parliamentary (EP) elections demonstrated, the politics of the EU looks to be moving to the right as the UK gets its first left-of-centre government in 14 years. The impact of the EP results is already being felt. French President Emmanuel Macron immediately called for a national parliamentary election as the far-right National Rally defeated his Renaissance Party 32% to 15%. While the National Rally fell short of its own expectations in the subsequent election, Marcon’s authority is still weakened and it will be challenging keeping his new centre-left coalition together. The EP result for the opposition Christian Democratic Union and the far-right Alternative for Germany also reinforced the sense that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s coalition government is a lame duck, with over 14 months to limp on. Elsewhere, existing authoritarian inclinations in Hungary are complemented by right-leaning leaderships in Slovakia and the Netherlands. Others might follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The purpose of any UK–EU cooperation should first and foremost be to deliver additional value for European security as it faces its biggest crisis since the Second World War&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are opportunities for the UK to use its considerable political influence with EU member states, especially in defence and security policy, which has grown since the 2022 invasion. As an example, in Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, the newly nominated High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the UK has a powerful advocate for stronger UK engagement at the heart of the EU’s institutions. However, the emerging EU political landscape will require careful management by the new government. In some instances, such as the special relationship that had developed between former Prime Minister Sunak and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and her political ascendency in the EU, relationships may prove to be more rather than less complicated with the change of government in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-the-objective&quot;&gt;What is the Objective?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary driver for Labour’s UK–EU pact seems political – drawing a clean break with the previous Conservative approach. However, this focus confuses means and ends. The purpose of any UK–EU cooperation should first and foremost be to deliver additional value for European security as it faces its biggest crisis since the Second World War. Sunak’s government has already done some of the work by jettisoning some of the Brexit divisiveness and rhetoric such as “Global Britain”. This must be furthered to capitalise on the unity that support for Ukraine has fostered and to stress that the UK and EU are allied in a shared common purpose to strengthen European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London should therefore be less obsessed with potential structures and getting a formal agreement over the line, and more driven on those areas where stronger UK–EU cooperation adds real value and cohesiveness to European allies and partners as they continue to respond to Vladimir Putin’s destabilisation of European security. Labour’s use of the language of a “security pact” with the EU is eye-catching, but of greater value are the substantive issues rather than the packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a cost to an agreement that is intended to encapsulate and facilitate a wide range of areas of cooperation. For the EU, the more ambitious the agreement, the more policy areas governed by different EU legal and decision-making arrangements it will have, making it longer and more complicated to negotiate and ratify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London should also be prepared for a heavy dose of realism as to what a pact might deliver, regardless of its ambition, as value for both sides is not a given. Indeed, even when the Labour government under Tony Blair set up the European Security and Defence Policy – the precursor to CSDP – in 1998, alongside France and against advice from his own diplomatic and military establishment, it was not a priority for the UK. It failed on its central “Helsinki Headline goal”, and the UK continued to align most closely with the US and NATO in the major conflicts that followed in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK will inevitably experience frustrations as a partner of the EU, with different tempos in their respective policymaking machinery. As recent examples, the UK and EU have both embarked on counter-Houthi naval operations in the Red Sea and training for Ukrainian soldiers, but it took the EU a considerable time to agree on the structure for its own missions. In the interim, the UK made other arrangements – supporting the US in the former and choosing to establish its own Ukraine training mission, where the speed of implementation attracted the participation of Finland and Sweden – then EU but not NATO members – in advance of the establishment of the EU Training Mission. An agility disparity would likely persist even if a formal UK–EU agreement is reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mechanisms&quot;&gt;Mechanisms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new UK government should focus on agreeing a “UK–EU Joint Declaration on defence and security” as soon as practically possible to set a strong direction of travel. This would affirm the designation of each party as key allies who should engage in foreign, security and defence cooperation of a scale and scope that reflects their status. The Declaration would also set out a roadmap for substantive areas of cooperation to form building blocks for a modernised relationship. If this could be agreed in the remainder of this year, the UK could then use its strong relationship with Poland - as it takes over the rotating EU Council Presidency from 1 January 2024 – to undertake the substantive negotiations, also knowing the outcome of the US presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a Declaration would not conflict with the existing TCA, nor require its revision. However, the periodic review of the TCA, first set for 2026, might be used to reconsider whether the limited provisions that it contains on UK–EU cooperation on international issues might be adjusted to be more expansive. The TCA review timetable would also align with the announced timeline for the Strategic Defence Review that Labour has pledged for its first year in office. This would allow for clarity from a new UK government as to the ideal form and function of cooperation with the EU on defence and security. Moreover, it would be wise to keep defence and security policy as a separate mechanism from the TCA in order to increase flexibility in a fast-changing European security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-substantive-areas-should-it-cover&quot;&gt;What Substantive Areas Should It Cover?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A UK–EU Declaration should prioritise substantive areas for cooperation, rather than institutional landmarks, as the key to a close relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there needs to be a full alignment of Ukraine and Russia strategies for the long term. Supporting Ukraine to liberate its territory and denying Russia any strategic benefit from its invasion is a shared priority. While the current political strategy is set in NATO and the G7/Quad, as Ukraine moves down the road towards EU and NATO membership, there will be a need for better UK–EU coordination. The UK no longer has a say in EU enlargement, but it does have a significant stake in its successful conclusion – and, unlike the EU, the UK has a direct say in NATO’s enlargement. Both the EU and the UK will have a shared interest in Ukraine’s dual membership tracks proceeding in a synchronised manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there is China and the Indo-Pacific. The UK and the EU both have Indo-Pacific strategies, alongside five other individual European countries. As such, the broad European approach to China is disconnected and very piecemeal in some areas. At a minimum, the EU and UK need closer coordination (notably on the Indo-Pacific), especially as the UK is making long-term defence commitments through AUKUS and the Global Combat Air Programme that will be more effective if better coordinated. Moreover, for both the UK and the EU, greater European coordination may be necessary to manage any deconfliction with the US in its intent and interests in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Labour Party has acknowledged that a more coherent UK–EU relationship on foreign, security and defence policy would be beneficial, but it needs to make its ambitions more concrete&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the idea of an EU Defence Union now has a strong grip inside Brussels and some national capitals. The UK interest is in an “open” form of strategic autonomy and to embrace the EU as a vehicle for enhancing member state defence capabilities through encouraging greater economies of scale in defence procurement and driving down inefficiencies and duplications. A UK recognition that the EU is now an actor in European defence could be translated into greater advocacy for EU–NATO cooperation, rather than the current ambivalent position. The UK’s expectation might then be that the EU is more accommodating of the UK within its current defence industrial policy ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the emerging EU defence industrial policy ecosystem is largely closed to third countries (excepting EEA states). The direction of EU policy is of significant interest to the UK as a large defence industrial player and – just as importantly – if EU policy succeeds, European defence capabilities development will have a positive impact on what the 23 joint EU–NATO members contribute to assets available to the Alliance. The UK’s defence industrial footprint and its collaborative programmes with European states are an asset of benefit in any plan to rebalance the European and US contributions to European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, third-party participation of the UK in CSDP missions would be of greatest benefit to the EU, with its Strategic Compass focus on Crisis Management. The former has an expeditionary mindset and capabilities to back this up. The UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force is a practical example of the benefits of setting significant ambitions for European states to operate collectively for pronounced effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sixth, intelligence. There is a significant disparity between UK and EU intelligence capabilities. The EU would benefit greatly from UK intelligence in all domains. The UK would also be able to actively contribute to the development of a European intelligence capability that addresses shared collective challenges more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-it-over-the-line&quot;&gt;Getting It Over the Line&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia’s war on Ukraine has demonstrated that shared interests can drive the UK and the EU to work closely together, there is a need for both sides to think long-term for the benefit of Europe. The Labour Party has acknowledged that a more coherent UK–EU relationship on foreign, security and defence policy would be beneficial, but it needs to make its ambitions more concrete. Thus far, the EU has not felt compelled to set out its own agenda for future security cooperation with the UK. Leadership changes in Brussels and London will allow for a stock-take of where cooperation might be enhanced. Moving quickly – especially in a climate in which US leadership may be in a state of flux – will be important, but ambitions for an enhanced relationship should privilege policy substance over a push for expansive formal agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;李家田稱貪小便宜留「屠龍」索資助、警播《監獄風雲》主題曲諷理大示威者&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jOnoZJl.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（8日）踏入第48日審訊。控方已完成舉證，現由辯方展開案情。被告李家田選擇作供，他稱案發時就讀浸大電影高級文憑，因關心社會運動而到示威現場拍攝紀錄片。李於8月5日在荃灣認識黃振強及其他被告，由於黃會提供資助予他去旅行及吃飯，李為「貪小便宜」而逗留在「屠龍」，同時他希望採訪示威者背後的故事。李表示為免失去資助，一直對黃「言聽計從」。另外，李提及曾進入理大收集示威者的故事，在理大被圍封後，警方一度播放《監獄風雲》的主題曲〈友誼之光〉，以揶揄及諷刺示威者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張俊富傳急症室醫生作供-指其小腿擦傷發炎&quot;&gt;張俊富傳急症室醫生作供 指其小腿擦傷發炎&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第一被告張俊富選擇不作供，但傳召急症室醫生作供。辯方早前指，張俊富在一次示威活動中受傷，因此未能參與行動。瑪嘉烈醫院急症室副顧問醫生陳宇勍供稱，於2019年12月8日為張診症，判斷他左小腿擦傷並受細菌感染，而他應該是5至6日前受傷，但沒有處理好傷口。至於第二被告張銘裕、第三被告嚴文謙均選擇不作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李家田稱父母均離世-曾就讀浸大電影高級文憑&quot;&gt;李家田稱父母均離世 曾就讀浸大電影高級文憑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第四被告李家田選擇作供，他身穿黑色西裝外套及黑色西褲，由兩名懲教人員押解至證人枱。李供稱於1996年出生，其父親及菲律賓籍母親分別於2017及2022年離世。李由出生至被捕一直居於麒麟村。李表示與父母關係良好，他出生後領洗，兒時會跟母親一同返天主教教堂，並獲母親給予暱稱「Angel」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李確認自己沒有刑事紀錄。他表示於基督教香港信義會心誠中學修畢中六，於2017年起浸會大學修讀電影高級文憑，主修攝影及燈光，但因沒有繳交最後一期學費而未能成功畢業。李表示自己熱愛拍攝，曾嘗試拍紀錄片。他亦指，當時因學業及工作繁忙，很少陪同母親前往教堂。辯方展示李在浸大讀書時的成績表及照片，顯示他曾於二年級的電影攝影課程獲A。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱關心社會運動並拍攝紀錄片&quot;&gt;李稱關心社會運動並拍攝紀錄片&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李供稱，於2019年6月反修例運動期間，他得知6月9日有示威者在「煲底」被捕後，就開始關心社會運動，並拍攝社會事件的紀錄片。他曾攜帶攝影機到和平遊行及暴力示威現場拍攝，但強調自己並無使用武力或參與暴動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱8月5日到荃灣拍攝時-認識其他被告&quot;&gt;李稱8月5日到荃灣拍攝時 認識其他被告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指當時有加入 Telegram 不同群組，後來有黑社會在荃灣用刀斬傷示威者，因此李於8月5日前往現場視察有否後續事件，並打算捕捉相關畫面。李目睹大量示威者在場，部分人想保護其他示威者。其間李認識本案被告包括：張俊富、嚴文謙、張銘裕及黃振強。他們亦將李加入「荃灣示威群組」。李表示與黃最相熟，與其他人則為普通朋友關係。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱獲黃振強資助-因貪小便宜逗留在屠龍&quot;&gt;李稱獲黃振強資助 因「貪小便宜」逗留在「屠龍」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指其後群組演變為「屠龍小隊」，而自己一直逗留在「屠龍」，是因黃振強經常出錢資助成員，包括請李及其他人吃飯，自己因此「貪小便宜」。李解釋自己當時「好窮」，要全面參與拍攝社會事件紀錄片，導致沒有時間工作。辯方展示李的戶口存款不足港幣一元，他承認因經濟環境欠佳而逗留在「屠龍」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱有興趣採訪屠龍背後故事&quot;&gt;李稱有興趣採訪「屠龍」背後故事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，直至8月25日在荃灣二陂坊的示威活動，「屠龍」開始出名並獲報導，李見狀有興趣採訪背後收藏的故事，並希望獲得更多創作靈感，因此繼續逗留在「屠龍」。他曾想過訪問成員，但最後沒有成事。辯方展示李傳給自己的訊息，內容提及訪問的大綱背景，包括：組隊源起及經過、名稱由來、加入條件、規矩紀律、對成為真勇武代名詞的看法及成名代價等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kQsx2rH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李承認被邀請加入「滅龍」及「皇馬龍利號」的 Telegram 群組，他於11月18日離開「皇馬龍利號」，其後於12月8日離開「滅龍」。他與黃振強有訊息往來，但沒有加入「行山討論區」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示黃付費邀請隊員到澳門旅行&quot;&gt;李表示黃付費邀請隊員到澳門旅行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示自己沒有參與台灣軍訓，但於10月9至10日「貪小便宜」應黃的邀請到澳門旅行，原因是黃提供船票及膳食，加上給予2千港元他到賭場賭錢，故覺得吸引。事後李感開心，因「有人肯畀錢，去令我有一個娛樂」。李續指，其後小隊的聚會支出都由黃付費。李形容上述均屬「福利」，同時認為黃樂意資助隊內成員。李承認曾問黃索取金錢買衣服，對方最後給予1,500元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李承認為免失資助-會對黃言聽計從&quot;&gt;李承認為免失資助 會對黃「言聽計從」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李解釋，為免失去黃的資助，因此會對黃「言聽計從」，盡量滿足其指示。李同意曾依照黃的指示剪片；至於黃要求李參與的示威活動，李會視乎情況選擇是否出席，若他想去其他示威地點採訪，就會找藉口推搪或轉移話題。李舉出例子，黃曾表示希望於12月1日到尖沙咀參與示威，李於是推搪回應「不如靜靜地去咗台灣先」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示獲邀到西貢行山-不知目的試槍及炸彈&quot;&gt;李表示獲邀到西貢行山 不知目的試槍及炸彈&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，李表示獲黃要求一同去西貢行山，由於自己收取對方很多資助及福利，因此答應。黃從沒有透露行山途中需要試槍及炸彈。在行山期間，李沒有參與試槍或炸彈，亦沒有獲得手槍。其後李收到張銘裕通知他會代替黃去西貢。李表示，自己沒有被加入「行山討論區」群組，因此不知群組內曾有訊息提醒行山時需關掉 Wi-Fi、藍芽及 GPS，亦不知吳智鴻曾要求出席者帶備手套及頭套等裝備。李稱當時身穿T恤、運動褲、跑鞋，並攜帶綠色斜孭袋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示行山中途被吩咐行遠啲&quot;&gt;李表示行山中途被吩咐「行遠啲」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於11月16日晚，李及張在彩虹站會合，並轉乘小巴前往西貢，抵達後再轉乘的士到山邊。張其後致電某人，並帶着李前往跟另一夥約3至4人會合。李表示並不認識其他人，之後跟隨他們行山。他們兩度抵達某位置停下，張吩咐李「行遠啲」，於是他照着辦，不久後他再獲指示繼續跟隨大隊走。李不知道等待期間各人在做甚麼。李又指，下山途中沒有人將手槍給他。辯方展示李在行山期間的 GPS 位置。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃振強早前供稱，吳智鴻與李有私下聯絡。李今表示兩人沒有溝通，他亦沒有收到訊息要拿東西給吳。李只是在行山後即11月18日，收到吳傳來訊息，但自己沒有回覆。李又指，從來沒有收到黃的訊息要取回手槍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示到理大為收集示威者故事&quot;&gt;李表示到理大為收集示威者故事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，行山完畢後他返回與朋友合租、位於新蒲崗的影片工作室。他睡了一會後，為了想在「陣地」收集更多示威者故事，於是早上約11時半出發搭的士前往理大，並在暢運道與漆咸道南交界下車。李發現地上佈滿磚陣，他步行往理大時認為現場氣氛平靜，沒有發生任何衝突。李形容自己當時穿黑色衫褲、僅帶備豬嘴，沒有任何武器。李強調進入理大目的是關注示威者背後的故事、狀態、感受及行為，並不關注前線示威者與警方對峙的情況，亦非為參與暴動或支持暴動者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ACPB3Nl.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱嘗試離開但不成功&quot;&gt;李稱嘗試離開但不成功&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示至晚上約6至7時，留意到消息指警方宣布8時仍不離開的人士，會遭以暴動罪拘捕。李於7時半嘗試從暢運道離開，但因該處有示威者與警方衝突，故不成功。他折返理大後，目睹示威者投擲汽油彈導致警方裝甲車著火。李當時認為，警方不會遵守承諾讓示威者離開，後來警方延長「死線」至10點，只容許理大內人士從 Y Core 離開。李得知 Y Core 情況混亂故沒有離開。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱警方播監獄風雲主題曲友誼之光-以揶揄示威者&quot;&gt;李稱警方播《監獄風雲》主題曲「友誼之光」 以揶揄示威者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李列舉出在理大找到的「故事」例子，包括警方於11月17日晚圍封理大後，示威者進入恐慌狀態，警方播放《監獄風雲》的主題曲〈友誼之光〉，以揶揄及諷刺示威者，同時用大喇叭說話侮辱他們。李又指，曾進入地下的課室發現環境黑暗及凌亂，隱約聽到有女聲顫抖問：「邊個呀？」，李相信示威者為避開警方追捕而躲進無人的地方，他表示「唔好意思」後離去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示在模糊及迷失情況下離開理大&quot;&gt;李表示在模糊及迷失情況下離開理大&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，其後他進入射箭房，看到有中年男子手持弓箭及射箭會的會員證，勸阻拿弓的示威者，並指警方見到會開真槍，但該男子阻止無效。李補充自己為射箭隊成員，目睹部分示威者錯誤裝嵌弓箭。法官張慧玲問：「唔係問有咩故事？⋯你嘅背後故事就係佢哋好驚？」李解釋自己不會接觸示威者，只是用第三者角度觀察。李表示，由於被其他人的恐慌感染，在模糊及迷失的情況下，於11月18日凌晨1至2時離開理大，但他不記得如何離開。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李強調，自己因被困理大，而沒有參與「屠龍」於11月17日晚在荃灣大鴻輝一間餐廳的會面。紀錄顯示李於17日晚退出「滅龍」群組，他解釋擔心被捕，故避免不必要的誤會。黃振強於11月18日發訊息稱：「有冇人可以 keep 眼鏡，阿檸出唔到嚟」，李表示因退組而看不到訊息。李最後於21日被加回群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（9日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（8日）續處理第三批被告、6名九龍東初選參與者的求情。代表快必譚得志的大律師梁寶琳認為，譚屬於「其他參加者」，指他雖有簽署「墨落無悔」和「共同綱領」，但沒有組織初選；又強調初選是開放予所有人參加的民主選舉，譚辦街站、參與選舉論壇等只是一般選舉會做的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，譚曾因煽動等罪成服刑40個月，望法庭考慮整體量刑原則酌情減刑至少20個月。辯方又強調，譚被捕後已退出人民力量，再沒有機會重返政壇，他還柙逾3年已付上代價；作為基督徒、取得基督教研究和神學兩個碩士學位的他，正在讀《懺悔錄》，嘗試學習和懺悔。法官陳仲衡和李運騰聞言一度表示，他們未能讀完該書。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李嘉達無到庭-5人由4懲教隔坐&quot;&gt;李嘉達無到庭 5人由4懲教隔坐&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選九東初選的黃之鋒、譚文豪、李嘉達上周五（5日）完成求情，法庭今處理譚得志、胡志偉及施德來3人的求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已完成求情的李嘉達今無到庭，其餘5人續坐在同一排，由4名懲教人員隔坐，黃之鋒續被安排坐在離旁聽席最遠的被告欄角落位置，與其他被告相隔3名懲教。胡志偉步入庭時，看到旁聽親友即面露微笑說「喂！」再揮手，黃之鋒展示手中書本並豎起拇指，施德來和譚文豪亦揮手。快必譚得志則拿梳梳頭，又豎拇指和戚眉，他手持一張寫有字的紙，懲教一度着他「唔好 show」，他笑言「廢紙嚟」、「呢度點敢 show」。聆訊期間，譚得志和黃之鋒不時低頭抄寫，譚又頻向旁聽席做手勢和發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方辦街站參與論壇為一般選舉會做的事&quot;&gt;辯方：辦街站、參與論壇為一般選舉會做的事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表譚得志的大律師梁寶琳表示，譚生於1972年，現年52歲，是香港大學和中文大學的畢業生，擁有基督教研究和神學兩個碩士學位，他曾任職電台主持逾20年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方主張，譚得志為「其他參加者」，指他沒有組織、計劃、發起或領導初選計劃，而雖然他有簽署「墨落無悔」和「共同綱領」、提交提名表格，但無證據他製作相關文件，他僅僅是計劃的參加者。辯方同意，譚在《國安法》生效後沒有退出計劃，但強調舉辦街站、參與選舉論壇等，只是一般選舉會做的事；而控方指稱譚於論壇自言為「強硬反對派（hard-line rebel）」，亦是一般選舉論壇會說、用以贏得選舉的說話，而譚只是呼籲人們投票，並一如其他候選人般派發口罩和防疫物資，只屬普通參加者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡主動提到，辯方引用中國刑法的釋義及實用指南，定義「積極參加者」為「主動參加犯罪集團並多次參與犯罪活動」，問譚得志是否屬於此類別。法官李運騰亦指，表面看來譚是符合該定義。梁寶琳表示，譚作為人民力量副主席，的確是自行參與初選，但強調初選作為開放予所有人參加的民主選舉，譚主動參與並不應構成他屬「積極參加者」；又指當時對於參與初選是否犯法並不清楚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方曾因煽動等判監40個月-望酌情減刑&quot;&gt;辯方：曾因煽動等判監40個月 望酌情減刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，譚得志於2022年11月因發表煽動文字等11罪成而判監40個月，指該案與本案案發時間相近，望法庭考慮整體量刑原則（totality principle），酌量減刑至少20個月，以免造成壓毀性影響（crushing effect）。辯方又指，譚已自2021年起還柙，他因本案被捕後已退出人民力量，在初選亦只排名第四，已再沒有機會重返政壇（no chance of him going into politics ever again）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/erRaeBU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指譚每天讀懺悔錄-官稱未能看完&quot;&gt;辯方指譚每天讀《懺悔錄》 官稱未能看完&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁寶琳又指，譚得志是基督徒，他現在每天都會讀《懺悔錄》（Confessions），正在嘗試學習和懺悔，顯示他的悔意。法官陳仲衡即笑說，「我的『懺悔』是我嘗試看完那本書，但從不成功。」（“My confession is that I tried to finish that book, but I can never.”）李運騰接續說：「我也是，我只讀了第一章，便無法繼續下去。」（“Me too, I just read the first chapter, I can’t carry on.”）梁續說，「他就是這樣的人，堅持不懈（perseverance）。」李運騰指，希望這個「堅持」是好的方面。（“I hope you used perseverance in a good sense.”）梁回應，無論如何，譚已經還柙逾3年，他已為這案所做和所說的付上了代價。不時向旁聽席戚眉發笑的譚得志，在求情最末表現平靜，手搭着手閉上眼睛。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，快必對旁聽席梳頭，又笑着揮手說：「Bye bye!」，「I love you!」、「I love you all!」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，《懺悔錄》為公元394至400年聖奧古斯丁用拉丁語寫的自傳體回憶，全書分為13卷，概述了奧古斯丁年輕時犯下的罪過和他改信基督教的過程。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪、周天行、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋。黃之鋒由大律師李國威代表；譚文豪由資深大律師何沛謙代表；李嘉達由大律師陳德昌代表；譚得志由大律師梁寶琳代表；胡志偉由大律師郭子丰代表；施德來由大律師黃廷光代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/s8iSClb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（8日）續處理6名九龍東初選參與者的求情。代表胡志偉的大律師郭子丰表示，胡無組織涉案謀劃，屬「積極參加者」的較低級別，並獲前運房局局長張炳良、副局長邱誠武及前勞福局局長羅致光3人撰寫求情信，指胡溫和、理性、務實，以人民和社會的最大利益為先。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，根據胡的背景、品格和多年政治信念，他無疑並非蓄意危害國安的激進政治人物，案發時真誠誤信運用否決權屬合法；又指謀劃成功的機會極微，因民主黨議員對預算案如何投票無最終決定權。辯方又指，胡自2021年1月還柙至今，並就六四及七一集結案服刑，望法官考慮整體量刑而減刑。法官則指，胡的良好品格和對社會貢獻已被早前案件考慮作減刑因素。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方胡志偉最多屬積極參加較低級別&quot;&gt;辯方：胡志偉最多屬「積極參加」較低級別&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;譚得志一方完成求情後，由胡志偉一方求情。代表胡志偉的大律師郭子丰表示，胡志偉最多只是「積極參加者」的較低級別，因無證據顯示他組織「35+計劃」，他只是透過參與選舉論壇、街站、接受訪問、參加初選和報名立法會選舉等，作出和應（echo）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭又指，民主黨起初無對否決預算案的計劃「落水」，其中胡於2020年6月九東初選論壇便曾反問，難道「起醫院、起學校我哋都要反對咩」，顯示他當時對「攬炒」和無差別否決預算案有保留。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張炳良邱誠武羅致光撰求情信-指胡溫和理性務實&quot;&gt;張炳良、邱誠武、羅致光撰求情信 指胡溫和、理性、務實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭子丰續指，胡志偉參與公共和政治事務逾30年，他曾當選市政局議員，學會制訂政策、解決社會矛盾時尋求「雙贏」方法，而非「攬炒」，他亦秉持此原則行事。而這並非胡的一面之辭，他獲前運輸及房屋局局長張炳良、副局長邱誠武、及前勞工及福利局局長羅致光撰求情信（其中張和羅曾為民主黨成員），3人均形容胡是溫和、務實的人，即使不同意政府政策仍然保持有禮、理性，以人民和社會的最大利益為先。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TVGxGv6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前勞工及福利局局長 羅致光&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，胡的貢獻獲政府肯定，如2006年政府曾就他為黃大仙區的服務頒授榮譽勳章；他亦曾獲委任加入中央政策組、大嶼山發展諮詢委員會委員等，顯示政府視他為可靠、負責的人，也可見無差別否決預算案不符他的本性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方民主黨議員投票須獲授權謀劃成功機會極微&quot;&gt;辯方：民主黨議員投票須獲授權、謀劃成功機會極微&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭續提到，根據民主黨黨章，如有成員不滿該黨立法會議員的決定，可召開會員大會要求推翻；議員在投票前須獲得授權，若無授權下仍一意孤行便須退黨，可見立法會議員對預算案如何投票沒有最終決定權。辯方指，由此解釋了胡志偉和所有民主黨員在競選時，也沒有完全承諾無差別否決或「攬炒」，只是提倡會運用《基本法》權力迫使政府回應五大訴求，因他們不能作出那樣的承諾，否則是向公眾公然說謊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭續指，判刑時須考慮涉案謀劃的可能性，並指謀劃本身因不同因素已難以實現，而民主黨的制度令其更難實現，因即使該黨議員同意無差別否決，但最終無獲授權、或不願退黨便不能如此投票，客觀而言，謀劃成功的機會極微。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，無論謀劃成功與否，胡志偉已認罪，代表他有意圖顛覆，辯方同意，但重申謀劃充滿不確定、其後果只能臆測。陳慶偉再指，但戴耀廷對此非常樂觀，辯方回應只能代表胡志偉陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方胡真誠誤信可用基本法權力游說政府&quot;&gt;辯方：胡真誠誤信可用基本法權力游說政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，胡志偉案發時真誠相信涉案謀劃為合法，相信可運用《基本法》賦予的憲制權力游說政府。雖然事後回看知道屬錯誤，但根據胡的背景、品格、多年政治信念，無疑他並非蓄意危害國安的激進政治人物。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡一度問，辯方如何能說胡志偉當時真誠相信投票顛覆政府是合法？郭重申，胡當時認為運用《基本法》賦予的權力是合法，並同意法官李運騰總結，胡當時是利用合法的手段（means），去達致顛覆的非法目的（end），認為可因此減輕其罪責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指胡曾就兩案服刑望減刑-官稱前案已考慮&quot;&gt;辯方指胡曾就兩案服刑望減刑 官稱前案已考慮&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就胡志偉的定罪紀錄，郭子丰指，胡於2021年1月8日因違反七一案保釋條件而遭還柙；其後涉2020七一遊行案，承認煽惑及組織未經批准集結兩罪，判監10個月；再因六四31年集會案承認明知而參與未經批准集結罪，判監4.5個月，他並於2022年1月服刑完畢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭指，上述案件與本案的案發時間和性質相近，當中七一案中，胡曾手持「反對國安惡法，七一齊上街」的標語牌、亦提及初選，至於六四案雖非明確與《國安法》有關，但望法庭考慮過往30年也有紀念六四的集會，各政黨亦會藉此機會發聲，望考慮整體量刑原則（totality principle）而減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，胡志偉擁有良好品格及對社會的貢獻，已被早前案件的法官考慮作減刑因素；法官陳仲衡亦指，張炳良此前也曾為胡撰求情信。郭同意胡不能享有雙重折扣，又指張炳良求情信的內容有所不同，主要談及對胡以及涉案謀劃的理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;胡志偉聽取求情時表現平靜，求情完畢後，向旁聽席微笑揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（8日）續處理6名九龍東初選參與者的求情。代表施德來的大律師黃廷光表示，施德來屬「積極參加者」的中至低級別，施於本案後已辭任主席和退出民協，重犯機會低。辯方又指，施為註冊社工，但在新修訂的《社工註冊條例》下，罪成的施將無法再任社工，形容其以社工身分服務公眾的抱負破滅。惟辯方指，施於獄中報讀都大心理學課程，望裝備自己，在服刑完畢後以其他崗位貢獻社會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第三批被告今完成求情，本周三（7月10日）將處理第四批被告求情，為6名九龍西初選參與者：岑子杰、毛孟靜、馮達浚、劉澤鋒、何啟明、黃碧雲，2名超區初選參與者岑敖暉、王百羽，及衞生服務界參選者余慧明，料需時3天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指施德來已不再是民協成員&quot;&gt;辯方指施德來已不再是民協成員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;譚得志及胡志偉求情完畢後，由施德來一方進行陳詞。代表施德來的大律師黃廷光表示，施德來為註冊社工，已婚，育有一名9歲兒子，其妻子和家人好友也有到庭支持。黃指，施的學業成績雖然並非特別出眾，但以其努力一步一步邁向成功，他2005年於城市大學副學士畢業，再於雪菲爾哈倫大學（Sheffield Hallam University）取得社會科學學位，並於2018年取得理工大學社工碩士，成為社工服務公眾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，施2008年加入民協，2016年當選黃大仙區議員及成為民協主席，亦曾獲委任為淫褻物品審裁委員小組成員9年，不同政府部門曾發信表揚他的貢獻。而施在本案後辭任民協主席，以非政治的方式服務社會，現時亦不再是民協的成員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指屬積極參加者罪成令社工夢碎&quot;&gt;辯方指屬「積極參加者」、罪成令社工夢碎&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，根據上周生效的《社工註冊條例》修訂，若被裁定危害國安罪成的人將無法再任社工，形容施德來以社工身分服務公眾的抱負破滅。雖然如此，施於獄中報讀都會大學的心理學課程，希望更好裝備自己，服刑完畢後以其他崗位貢獻社會，望法庭考慮施具良好品格。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃廷光承認，本案性質非常嚴重，但望法庭考慮施屬「積極參加者」的中至低級別量刑。黃又望法庭考慮施擁有正面良好品格，他積極服務公眾和社會，真誠誤信運用否決權合法，亦展示真誠悔意，重犯機會低，望法庭能寬大處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，黃之鋒、胡志偉、施德來、譚文豪均向旁聽席揮手，譚文豪亦向旁聽席微笑點頭。譚得志與律師溝通後，亦對旁聽席梳頭，又笑着揮手說：「Bye bye!」、「I love you!」、「I love you all!」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

This report assesses Chinese and Russian disinformation efforts in the Indo-Pacific and charts an agenda for the United States and Japan in combating it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disinformation and other forms of “information operations” have become tools of choice for authoritarian regimes seeking to coerce and influence adversaries in the “gray zone” below the threshold of military conflict. Russia famously employed these tools in its effort to influence the U.S. presidential election in 2016 and continues to use them as part of its war of aggression against Ukraine. China uses disinformation to influence political developments across the Indo-Pacific region, including through an effort to influence the results of Taiwan’s presidential election in January 2024. As Japan’s National Security Strategy notes, “Grey zone situations over territories, cross-border cyberattacks on critical civilian infrastructures, and information warfare through spread of disinformation, are constantly taking place, thereby further blurring the boundary between contingency and peacetime.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report explores the disinformation threat environment in the Indo-Pacific region, with a particular focus on China and, to a lesser extent, Russia. It examines tools and methods for combating disinformation and seeks to chart an agenda for deeper collaboration between the United States and Japan in addressing this growing challenge. This report incorporates the results of a closed-door conference held at CSIS in February 2024 which featured experts on this subject from the United States and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Disinformation and other forms of “information operations” have become tools of choice for authoritarian regimes seeking to coerce and influence adversaries in the “gray zone” below the threshold of military conflict.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scope-and-definitions&quot;&gt;Scope and Definitions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many terms used to describe the manipulation or selective use of information for malign purposes, many of which are used interchangeably. These terms carry specific connotations, which “can lead to assumptions about how information spreads, who spreads it, and who receives it.” Therefore, it is important to foster a common lexicon of terms for this report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information operations&lt;/strong&gt; (also referred to as “influence operations”) encompass various strategies aimed at influencing a targeted audience’s decisionmaking, beliefs, and opinions or otherwise affecting their mindset, as defined by Kuwahara Kyoko. John Garnaut further describes these as a type of “political interference”: covert, corrupt, or coercive actions designed to manipulate public opinion. Information operations serve as the umbrella concept that encompasses the other terms identified here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disinformation&lt;/strong&gt;, a key component of information operations and the focus of this report, is characterized by a deliberate intention to deceive and manipulate. Perpetrators deliberately and often covertly disseminate false information, making attribution challenging. Externally originated disinformation narratives often intertwine with domestic ones and commercial sensationalism, further complicating identification. It is crucial to recognize that disinformation may not be entirely false; effective disinformation typically blends truth (verifiable facts) with fabrication (unverifiable information).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misinformation&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, refers to verifiably false information disseminated regardless of intent to mislead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malinformation&lt;/strong&gt; involves sharing genuine information with the intent to cause harm, often by exposing private details to the public sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, &lt;strong&gt;propaganda&lt;/strong&gt;, which often is overt in origin, is orchestrated by operators seeking to influence public perception through information that can be true but is typically of a biased or misleading nature.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessing-the-threat-environment&quot;&gt;Assessing the Threat Environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and, to a lesser extent, Russia are the primary sources of information operations and disinformation in the Indo-Pacific. This section highlights the objectives and strategies of China and Russia and describes specific narratives they seek to propagate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;china&quot;&gt;China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese information operations have expanded significantly in scope and sophistication in recent years, particularly after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic as Beijing sought to shape international views of the virus’s origin. Beijing is working to promote both positive views of China in the region and to stimulate negative views of the United States and its allies. Narratives that China seeks to spread vary regionally and closely relate to its larger strategic objectives, including degrading the willingness of partners to work closely with the United States and weakening Southeast Asian unity on regional security issues such as territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Recent research indicates that China’s primary goals — and the associated narratives used to achieve them — are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote a positive view of China and of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), including bolstering Xi Jinping’s image.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, Beijing depicted itself as a benevolent aid giver during the Covid-19 pandemic. China frequently attempted to arrange handover ceremonies and statements of gratitude from countries where it sent medical supplies and vaccines. In fact, however, 99 percent of its medical supply exports and 96 percent of its vaccine exports were sales, not donations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote China’s style of governance as a model for developing countries to emulate, weakening the international liberal world order and the influence of democracy.&lt;/strong&gt; Xi Jinping is known to assert, for example, that China’s system offers “a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage openness to Chinese investment and strategic engagement abroad by highlighting the benefits of the Belt and Road Initiative and spreading the narrative that cooperation with China produces “tangible economic benefits.”&lt;/strong&gt; In one such instance, China emphasized the connection between population surveillance and economic growth to Nigerian state-level officials when pitching a comprehensive “safe city” package, a move designed to make people associate norms of surveillance and information control with prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marginalize, demonize, or suppress anti-CCP voices and commentary that presents the Chinese government and its leaders in a negative light.&lt;/strong&gt; Examples of this include the recent sentencing of Australian scholar Yang Hengjun and the detainment of Hokkaido University professor Iwatani Nobu. Yang is a pro-democracy activist who was arrested for espionage in 2019. Iwatani is a Japanese historian apparently arrested for possession of materials related to the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937−1945) — suggesting that Beijing is focused on controlling historical narratives related to the origins of the People’s Republic of China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foster doubts about U.S. intentions and commitment to the region and undermine U.S. relationships with key allies and partners.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, between 2018 and 2020, China used a network of 161 Facebook and Instagram accounts to promote negative public opinion in the Philippines of the U.S.-Philippines alliance. The disinformation campaign portrayed U.S. actions in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait as aggressive, praised Chinese naval operations in the South China Sea, and promoted Filipino leaders with favorable opinions toward China’s regional policies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These various narratives are perpetrated and supported by the Chinese government, but they also emerge organically both inside China and among populations abroad who have been influenced by the CCP’s strategic messaging. A prime example of this dynamic is the disinformation surrounding the release of treated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plants (discussed in more detail later in this report). While Beijing has sought to promote a false narrative that the water release presents a health risk to the Indo-Pacific, similar narratives have emerged organically, both inside Japan and in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chinese information operations have expanded significantly in scope and sophistication in recent years, particularly after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic as Beijing sought to shape international views of the virus’s origin.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-disinformation-strategies-four-main-lines-of-effort&quot;&gt;Chinese Disinformation Strategies: Four Main Lines of Effort&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis shows that China uses a variety of techniques to spread preferred narratives and influence the information environment. Its strategies and tactics reflect increasing sophistication and employ novel techniques and goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generate pro-China multimedia content that is accessible and compelling and that appears credible.&lt;/strong&gt; Beijing creates approved content and makes it readily accessible to Chinese media outlets around the world, including in the Mekong region, Kenya, Brazil, and many other nations worldwide; in some cases, it offers content for free or at reduced rates. China also influences foreign opinions through content-sharing agreements with media outlets in countries ranging from Australia to Zimbabwe to Peru to Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amplify pro-China content and maximize channels for distributing it.&lt;/strong&gt; All major state media outlets have accounts on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook, and some make use of YouTube and Instagram. Collectively, these accounts have substantial followings, in some cases in the tens of millions. These approaches are complemented by the development and deployment of social media networks such as WeChat and TikTok, which are increasingly influential globally. WeChat also performs a surveillance function, monitoring politically sensitive conversations among users outside of China. The U.S. Department of State’s Global Engagement Center found that as of August 2023, China has roughly 333 “diplomatic and official media accounts,” with nearly 65 million followers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence local media to suppress criticism and promote China-friendly narratives while spreading narratives critical of the United States and other countries China sees as adversaries.&lt;/strong&gt; China employs fear to suppress information and narratives it finds unfavorable, in some cases by threatening physical violence, taking legal action, or restricting access to the lucrative Chinese market for foreign media outlets, journalists, and academics. Punishment of academics or journalists who write content critical of the CCP’s leadership incentivizes self-censorship both within China and internationally. Opportunistic reporting is another tactic, in which China amplifies stories that undermine its adversaries and stoke historical animosities. China has sought to disseminate news stories exaggerating safety concerns in communities surrounding U.S. bases in Japan, including crimes involving U.S. military personnel in Okinawa, and issues relating to the history of Korean “comfort women” during the Japanese colonial period.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s disinformation campaigns are increasingly sophisticated and far-reaching. Prior to Taiwan’s presidential election in January 2024, for example, Beijing employed a comprehensive strategy that ranged from framing the choice between the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Kuomintang (KMT) as one of “war” versus “peace” to exploiting local issues and using local proxies to promote rumors of scandal involving DPP leaders. The effectiveness of China’s disinformation efforts remains open to question, however. The campaign against Taiwan, which has developed a robust rapid-response infrastructure to combat disinformation, was ultimately a failure, and there are numerous examples elsewhere of propaganda not resonating due to a lack of credibility, anti-China sentiment, and competition from foreign media outlets with well-established reputations. A recent report from the Center of Analysis for Democracy finds that pro-China propaganda on popular streaming platforms in Latin America and Spain has failed to attract Spanish-speaking audiences. Research on strategic messaging in Tibet shows how anti-China sentiment limits the efficacy of the CCP’s “patriotic education programs,” even inside of China. And the Center for Naval Analyses highlights widespread suspicion of China in the Mekong region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The effectiveness of China’s disinformation efforts remains open to question.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also unclear whether China itself possesses tools for measuring the effectiveness of its information operations; the bureaucratic apparatus surrounding these campaigns appears to emphasize quantity over impact. For example, China has expanded state-owned media outlets globally over the past decade, reaching 181 bureaus in 142 countries as of August 2021. Some of these outlets produce massive numbers of articles, such as the bureau in Nairobi, whose 150 journalists and 400 staff produce 1,800 stories a month. However, the rapid expansion of state-owned outlets has not corresponded to a general increase in readership or perceived credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, quantity can take on a quality of its own. In 2020, Google suspended tens of thousands of YouTube accounts linked to Chinese information operations. Many of them pushed disinformation that was poorly created and easy to identify as false. But by repeatedly exposing users to the same false narratives, these accounts sought to create a sense of familiarity and thereby convince the public of the accuracy of their narratives. As a report by the Institute for Strategic Research at the French Ministry for the Armed Forces explains, “Actors involved in disinformation campaigns will not always bother adopt [sic] an appearance of authenticity for the information they propagate. This is the reason why Chinese actors, in particular, seem to put quantity before quality.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia’s information operations have been thoroughly studied, its efforts to shape the information environment in Japan and the Indo-Pacific are less well known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s global efforts currently focus on undermining support for Ukraine by pushing the narrative that Ukraine was always “Russian” and sowing doubt about U.S. leadership, commitment, and intentions — narratives that also impact the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. Department of State’s Global Engagement Center (GEC) analyzed seven Kremlin-aligned disinformation proxy sites that amplified false narratives critical of the United States around the world. Japan and Australia were among the Indo-Pacific nations where narratives resonated most and where accounts sharing the content were concentrated. For example, content from the Russian-registered website SouthFront, which pushed “deep-state” conspiracy theories on the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic and U.S. border-wall funding, was particularly popular among Japanese media users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Although Russia’s information operations have been thoroughly studied, its efforts to shape the information environment in Japan and the Indo-Pacific are less well known.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding Japan, Russia attempts to spread the narrative that the two countries’ dispute over the Northern Territories — which the United States recognizes as Japanese — is an artificial creation and that Japan is a remilitarizing nation acting at Washington’s behest. Like China, Russia seeks to promote self-determination narratives in Okinawa to sow division domestically. It leverages anxieties in Japan about China’s military buildup by asserting that Tokyo should maintain good relations with Moscow to avoid pushing Russia toward China — a narrative that is far less effective since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s disinformation and propaganda ecosystem is made up of a “collection of official, proxy, and unattributed communication channels and platforms.” The GEC breaks these channels into five pillars: official government communications, state-funded global messaging, cultivated proxy sources, weaponized social media, and cyber-enabled disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian disinformation tactics also encompass “offline” strategies aimed at influencing foreign journalists, academics, and policymakers by inviting them to Russia, granting them access to high-ranking officials, and promoting narratives favorable to Moscow through platforms such as the Valdai Discussion Club. Political commentator Tucker Carlson’s February 2024 interview of Vladimir Putin is an obvious example of this. As “agents of influence,” these individuals serve as (potentially) unwitting conduits for Kremlin narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;collaboration-between-china-and-russia&quot;&gt;Collaboration between China and Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts on disinformation have an ongoing debate about the degree to which China and Russia explicitly coordinate information operations. Hosaka Sanshiro argues that cooperation in this realm has historically been a “forbidden zone,” with intelligence agencies from both nations protecting their independence and avoiding coordinated efforts, in part due to diverging geopolitical interests. The GEC’s 2023 special report argues the opposite, noting that in 2020 China and Russia agreed to “jointly combat disinformation [and] offer an accurate account of facts and truth.” The report outlines numerous examples of where China’s messaging amplified or mirrored Russia’s messaging, particularly on the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both nations seek to capitalize on underlying tensions in Okinawa related to the U.S. military presence there, hoping to sow division and undermine support for the United States. There are anecdotal examples of Russian and Chinese platforms echoing similar talking points or relying on the same proxy voices, such as an Indian geopolitical expert who has contributed to both the Global Times and Sputnik. At the very least, there is clear evidence that both countries opportunistically leverage disinformation and narratives that align with their geopolitical agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is unclear if these examples reflect explicit and deliberate cooperation, the increasing sophistication of China’s information operations clearly reflects learning from Russian strategies and techniques. A 2020 Freedom House report highlights the rapid evolution of Chinese disinformation methods, indicating a deliberate effort to adapt and refine strategies. Chinese attempts to meddle in social media, starting as early as 2017, appear to have drawn inspiration from Russia, although they appear less sophisticated. This gap may narrow as China continues to refine its disinformation techniques, potentially rivaling Russia’s expertise in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The increasing sophistication of China’s information operations clearly reflects learning from Russian strategies and techniques.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, China’s sponsorship of journalists who parrot official stances on Xinjiang reflects a concerted effort to control narratives and shape perceptions, mirroring Russia’s use of state-sponsored media outlets. Chinese authorities have also delved into “offline disinformation” methods taken from Russia’s playbook, exemplified by the CCP United Front Work Department’s activities in Australia and New Zealand, which aim to silence dissent and exert influence through financial largesse and coercive networks. A 2016 conference in Beijing that focused on Okinawa offers another example of how China uses in-person engagements strategically to exchange tactics and narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHINESE AND RUSSIAN INFORMATION OPERATIONS IN AND AROUND JAPAN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Japan’s geographical proximity to China, economic significance, and position as a U.S. ally, it is an inevitable target for Chinese information and disinformation operations. However, China’s efforts within Japan appear to be largely ineffective. Disinformation alone has been unable to offset the increasingly negative perceptions of China’s behavior among the Japanese public. Indeed, annual opinion surveys conducted by the Japanese government indicate historically high levels of confidence in the United States — and historically high levels of distrust toward China. Other factors, such as the limited presence of foreign media in Japan and the country’s distinct cultural and linguistic characteristics, contribute to the diminished impact of such influence operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Japan has become the target of Chinese disinformation campaigns elsewhere in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. Beginning in January 2023, China began a disinformation campaign to inflame international public opinion regarding Japan’s release of treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear reactor meltdown. In social media posts and news articles, China referred to “nuclear-contaminated wastewater” instead of “treated wastewater,” even though the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) determined that the release would have little impact on humans or the environment. Between January and August 2023, when the first batch of wastewater was released, posts by Chinese officials, state media, and pro-China influencers mentioning “Fukushima” increased by more than 1,500 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Given Japan’s geographical proximity to China, economic significance, and position as a U.S. ally, it is an inevitable target for Chinese information and disinformation operations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese disinformation related to Fukushima also targeted non-Japanese audiences. For example, the Global Times published around 126 English-language articles between January and August 2023 about the wastewater release. Similarly, Chinese state media ran at least 22 advertisements in languages such as English, German, Portuguese, and Khmer, emphasizing risks associated with the release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most concerningly, China amplified narratives questioning the accuracy of the IAEA report on the treated wastewater, implying that Japan had bribed the agency to support the release. On June 21, 2023, a South Korean media report surfaced that falsely claimed that Japan had made a €1 million ($1.1 million) political donation to the IAEA to resolve differences of opinion about the safety of the wastewater. Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded the following day with a press release unequivocally denying these claims. Yet, as reported in the Global Times, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs continued to call for Japan to explain why these allegations surfaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategies-for-combating-disinformation&quot;&gt;Strategies for Combating Disinformation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing threat of disinformation across the globe poses a daunting challenge for the United States and its allies and partners. Liberal democracies, with their commitment to freedom of expression and open media environments, are particularly vulnerable and face an asymmetric disadvantage. While banning the use of many Western social media platforms internally, for example, China uses those same platforms to influence the information environment around the world. To address this challenge, scholars and experts have identified various strategies and techniques involving technology, education, and regulation which, when used in combination, can help detect and mitigate information operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Liberal democracies, with their commitment to freedom of expression and open media environments, are particularly vulnerable and face an asymmetric disadvantage.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;public-education-and-media-literacy&quot;&gt;Public Education and Media Literacy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education and media literacy aim to address the root causes of political polarization and division that contribute to the spread of deceptive narratives. Recognizing that disinformation can both influence and be influenced by existing polarization, it is crucial to tackle underlying societal divisions to effectively mitigate its impact. While disinformation usually originates from malicious actors, its dissemination is often facilitated by unwitting individuals, particularly those dissatisfied with the existing political status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the United States and Japan have a long way to go in improving media literacy and building resilient societies capable of critically assessing information. As of 2021, they ranked 15th and 16th, respectively, out of 44 countries worldwide in terms of media literacy education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, there are currently no nationwide initiatives for enhancing media literacy and preparing Americans to think critically about mis- and disinformation. However, the nonprofit group Media Literacy Now has reported progress at the state level, with 19 states passing legislation providing funding for or mandating media literacy education in primary schools and in professional development programs. In addition, the Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life has developed a freely accessible syllabus for professional disinformation researchers or higher-education institutions in the United States that explicitly addresses how social inequalities and power structures shape disinformation. The Digital Inquiry Group has also partnered with Google to develop Civic Online Reasoning, a free website with curricula and research on countering information operations. However, these efforts still pale in comparison to concerted nationwide efforts in other countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Finland, and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan also lacks a comprehensive nationwide effort to promote media and information literacy, particularly in the context of mis- and disinformation. As in the United States, there are some isolated efforts to address the challenge. The Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) has introduced an online resource for teaching media literacy to elementary and middle school children, for example. The SmartNews Media Research Institute generates similar resources. In addition, the Japan Association for Educational Media Study has begun incorporating the topic of media literacy into its annual conferences for educators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, initiatives such as the regular defense courses offered by the International Centre for Defense and Security to opinion leaders — some of which have focused on elements of countering information operations — offer a blueprint for fostering high-level policy dialogue and curricula that can help maintain vigilance against disinformation. Nongovernmental organizations in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have launched a multilateral disinformation-monitoring platform focused on the Russian threat. Similarly, NATO has established the Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence to monitor Russian information operations and share research on the latest technological developments that Russia uses to spread disinformation. However, in the Indo-Pacific region, the absence of a larger multilateral security apparatus like NATO complicates coordinated responses to disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technology-based-approaches&quot;&gt;Technology-Based Approaches&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies are a double-edged sword in dealing with information operations. While there is increasing attention to how AI can help combat disinformation, “deepfakes” and other forms of synthetic content can also be used to amplify false narratives, creating highly convincing yet fabricated content at significant scale. With at least 64 countries worldwide holding elections in 2024, deepfakes impersonating political candidates, aimed at swaying voting habits, are a particular concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While emerging technologies can exacerbate the mis- and disinformation problem, they also can play a pivotal role in the ongoing battle against it, offering various tools and capabilities to identify, track, and combat deceptive content. Defensive AI systems are designed to detect patterns of behavior indicative of coordinated disinformation efforts, contributing to the early identification and mitigation of false narratives. AI tracking mechanisms deployed by platforms such as Overwatch and Google enable the monitoring of online activities to identify suspicious behavior and content. Companies and platforms such as Inflection AI, Google Gemini, and Blackbird AI offer narrative-identification and monitoring tools that recognize cultural nuances, allowing automatic response mechanisms to analyze comments and engage more effectively with diverse audiences, responding convincingly in real time — thereby combating disinformation at its source. Additionally, AI-enabled social-monitoring platforms can categorize narratives and extract insights from articles, enabling the identification of common threats and the development of targeted responses. AI and other technologies can play an integral role in advancing the following methods of combating influence operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FACT-CHECKING AND DEBUNKING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fact-checking and debunking methods play crucial roles in combating disinformation. While fact-checking typically adopts a broad and impartial approach, debunking is more strategic and targeted, aiming to address specific actors or topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the longstanding nature of the Russian threat, European allies have pioneered efforts to fact-check and debunk disinformation. The NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence delineates six primary goals of debunking, including asserting the truth, cataloging evidence of false information, and attributing sources of disinformation. Journalists and civil society organizations are also instrumental in leading regional fact-checking initiatives, collaborating with governments and private-sector entities such as Google. Examples of such organizations in the Indo-Pacific include FactCheck Initiative Japan (FIJ), Thai Fact-Checking Network, Annie Lab at the University of Hong Kong’s Journalism and Media Studies Centre, Rappler IQ in the Philippines, and CekFakta in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI-supported fact-checking — which incorporates manual, human verification of automated checks — can be critical for an effective response. Organizations such as The Factual, Check by Meedan, Logically, Full Fact, and FIJ all implement AI tools for fact-checking. These tools rely on natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval techniques such as speech recognition, reverse image searching, video forensics, and semantics analysis to assess whether information is likely to be false or misleading. Fact-checking — whether supported by AI or not — also serves as a fundamental prerequisite for prebunking efforts (discussed in the next section).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is somewhat late to the game in developing a fact-checking ecosystem. This is due in part to a lack of urgency — at least until recently — as disinformation was perceived more as a problem for the United States and Europe. The relatively delayed digitalization of mainstream media, coupled with the significant power held by Japanese broadcasters and news outlets, further slowed progress in fact-checking efforts. Nevertheless, there has been increased awareness and action, including the establishment of the Japan Fact-Check Center, which receives funding from tech giants such as Google and Yahoo. Moving forward, efforts to expand the scope of countermeasures are essential for effectively combating disinformation in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PREBUNKING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prebunking involves issuing proactive forewarnings and preemptively refuting false narratives. A dramatic example was the United States’ use of declassified intelligence information in the run-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The timely and repeated release of information on Russia’s military build-up and intentions limited Moscow’s ability to shape the media environment in advance; for example, this strategy undermined Russia’s plans to use a false-flag operation as an excuse to launch the invasion. Recent research suggests that prebunking is more effective than fact-checking, especially among populations who were previously misinformed or particularly susceptible to mis- and disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of the disinformation challenge limits the practicality of prebunking as a strategy to some degree. Not every narrative can be preempted. Still, like-minded governments can focus more on anticipating the narratives that adversaries might employ, such as China’s efforts to exploit the Fukushima water release. When resources are limited, selective prebunking is a practical and efficient strategy to address the most concerning narratives. Credibility is a critical factor in successful prebunking, with the perceived trustworthiness of cited sources often more important than the expertise behind it. Resources such as The Debunking Handbook 2020 and A Practical Guide to Prebunking Misinformation provide valuable insights and guidance for successfully implementing prebunking strategies, including effective narrative structures and technology-based tools for active and passive prebunking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;REMOVING FALSE NARRATIVES (CONTENT MODERATION)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Removing fake content or restricting access to it is a strategy employed by platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), which has previously acted against inauthentic accounts originating from China and removed tens of thousands of posts. By tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, platforms can identify the source of such content, including those from Chinese military bases. However, despite efforts to identify and remove fake content or inauthentic accounts algorithmically, this approach is not effective alone, as perpetrators often find ways to circumvent these measures; tactics include simply creating new accounts, operating from locations where IP addresses do not raise suspicion, or employing locals to disseminate false information. Moreover, a lack of transparency on how algorithms identify and remove content has sparked backlash among users and accusations of censorship in democratic societies. In part due to these challenges and financial streamlining, many companies are severely limiting or removing content moderation policies altogether. However, when used in tandem with other tactics, content removal can be an effective component of an overall strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LABELING, TRANSPARENCY, AND RISK MONITORING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts to strengthen digital content labeling have gained momentum globally. Some tech companies are developing digital stamps to indicate AI-generated content, particularly to target the threat posed by deepfakes. For instance, the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity aims to authenticate media by issuing “icons of transparency,” essentially a digital watermark for verified content. Transparency initiatives extend beyond identifying artificially generated content. Google took steps as early as 2018 to label government-funded content on YouTube, alerting viewers to sources that might amplify propaganda or conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-key-to-success-go-on-the-offensive&quot;&gt;A Key to Success: Go on the Offensive&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategies and techniques listed above are defensive, aimed at resisting and debunking adversaries’ disinformation campaigns. But ultimately success will hinge on pairing these approaches with an offensive strategy of strategic messaging to promote narratives that accurately and effectively reflect U.S. objectives, priorities, and values — and doing so in close coordination with like-minded allies and partners. An offensive strategy would center on both promoting affirmative narratives about U.S. power and purpose, as well as refuting the self-serving messages that China and Russia promote about themselves — such as that China does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries or that China offers a model for economic development that should be emulated elsewhere in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Success will hinge on pairing these approaches with an offensive strategy of strategic messaging to promote narratives that accurately and effectively reflect U.S. objectives, priorities, and values.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;japanese-government-approaches-to-countering-disinformation&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Japanese Government Approaches to Countering Disinformation&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Japanese government is dedicating increased effort to addressing disinformation and information operations. Japan’s 2022 National Security Strategy, for example, acknowledges the urgent need for developing a posture for “information warfare,” which it defines as using “the spread of disinformation prior to an armed attack.” This definition is arguably too narrow, however. As this report shows, Beijing’s disinformation campaigns in peacetime are central to a larger strategy of propagating influence to enable China to “win without fighting.” Japan’s current efforts to combat disinformation also suffer from decentralization and a lack of coordination across the government — although it is hardly alone in this regard. In addition, budgets for combating disinformation and information warfare remain thin. Collectively, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), the Ministry of Defense, and the National Police Agency allocate just 7.72 billion yen (about $49 million) against the threat. Draft legislation to strengthen Japan’s cyber capabilities and establish authorities for active cyber defense has languished, with no clear timeline for passage. In the meantime, MOFA has begun to introduce AI-based technologies to assist with analysis of international developments that could pose national security challenges.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-agenda-for-us-japan-cooperation&quot;&gt;An Agenda for U.S.-Japan Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and Japan have begun coordinating responses to the growing challenge posed by disinformation. In December 2023, the two governments signed a memorandum of cooperation on countering foreign information manipulation, laying the groundwork for shared approaches and activities such as information sharing and capacity building — and which Prime Minister Kishida Fumio and President Joe Biden endorsed at their meeting in April 2024. This is a good start, but far more needs to be done to address disinformation, a defining challenge of the modern era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and Japan now need to design an operational strategy for cooperation that also incorporates other key partners in the region. This project identified several avenues for enhancing collaboration between the United States, Japan, and other Indo-Pacific nations in combating disinformation. Unlike in Europe, where a variety of efforts to combat disinformation are underway through NATO, there is no existing multilateral structure that can be used to forge a common approach to the threat. Yet there are various areas of potential bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the Indo-Pacific:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deepen cooperation on strategic messaging.&lt;/strong&gt; Japan, the United States, and other like-minded countries in the Indo-Pacific should develop a coordinated offensive strategy for strategic messaging aimed at promoting narratives that support shared values and promote common objectives. This coordinated messaging should directly challenge the narratives, cited earlier in this report, that China and Russia seek to propagate. The raw material for this common strategy already exists — the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy is a clear articulation of U.S. policy, as is Japan’s Free and Open Indo-Pacific concept. A coordinated messaging strategy should focus on amplifying and reinforcing those themes and countering the pro-China narratives pushed by Beijing. Such an effort is probably best undertaken by Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the U.S. Department of State.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launch a collaborative research program and share lessons learned.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Japan should launch a multilateral research program in collaboration with like-minded allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific — such as Australia, South Korea, and the Philippines — to explore the evolving nature of Chinese and Russian disinformation tactics. This effort should also include universities and private research organizations. NATO’s Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence offers a blueprint for how to create a bilateral or multilateral framework for sharing research on these topics. In particular, Japan and the United States could quietly engage Taiwan to better understand both the tactics Beijing used to attempt to influence the 2024 presidential election and the strategies Taipei used to combat the threat. Building on the agreement at Camp David in 2023 between Japan, the United States, and South Korea to coordinate efforts to counter information manipulation, the allies should work to develop a multilateral framework for information sharing and lessons learned in countering disinformation. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue — consisting of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States — is another potential venue for this work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand cooperation on open-source intelligence collection and analysis.&lt;/strong&gt; The explosion of open-source information represents a significant challenge to governments seeking to better understand national security threats. No single government has the capacity to collect, process, and assess all of the open-source information available on a given topic — a challenge amplified by the imperative of distinguishing between facts and mis- and disinformation. The United States, Japan, and other partners, such as Australia and South Korea, should launch an open-source intelligence partnership to share strategies, assessments, and tools, including technology-based approaches that utilize artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinate prebunking.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States, Japan, and other partners should work together to prebunk problematic Chinese and Russian narratives. Like-minded governments should do more to both anticipate the narratives adversaries are likely to promote and undermine existing messaging that reflects biased views of China’s global role. The coordinated release of information on anticipated issues such as Chinese behavior in the South China Sea could also be an effective means of countering Chinese narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support education and training in third countries.&lt;/strong&gt; Fact-checking institutions already do some work together, demonstrating ample potential for building connections and pooling resources in the digital age. Examples of such efforts include individual country programs, such as the Ukraine Crisis Media Center and StopFake, as well as multinational and regional collaborations, such as EUvsDisinfo, the NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, and balticdisinfo.eu. The United States, Japan, and other partners could work together to support education and media literacy programs across the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooperation on content sharing.&lt;/strong&gt; Taking a page from China’s own playbook and subsidizing trustworthy news sources to counter China-sponsored fake news sites could be a further opportunity for collaboration. The United States and Japan could consider content-sharing agreements with nations inundated with disinformation and propaganda from China and Russia. Kyodo News and the Associated Press are examples of credible wire services that Japan and the United States could quietly make more widely available to media markets in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been told we live in a “pre-war” era, characterised by a darkening global mood, conflict and competition and the erosion of the so-called global order, and with a requirement to defend UK interests, by force if necessary. This is the context in which the previous UK government announced its intent to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, and regardless of how much this produces in terms of “new” funding (it certainly isn’t £75 billion), the UK’s Armed Forces face a series of major decisions, especially given the forthcoming review of Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relearning-the-lessons-of-major-war&quot;&gt;(Re)learning the Lessons of Major War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments and commentators alike have identified a rogues’ gallery of state threats, with Russia and China in the vanguard, Iran and North Korea following close behind, and non-state groups like Yemen’s Houthis filling in the gaps. While the headline is one of state-based competition and “peer conflict”, no cosy assumptions can be made about the end of significant threats from terrorism, nor insecurity caused by threats which don’t reach the threshold of open war, but which affect trade or business. To reinforce the point, NATO’s most recent Strategic Concept sets out the same range of threats, highlighting Russia along the way. With a core task of deterrence and defence, there is no doubt that industrial warfare is one of the key factors shaping NATO militaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine follows on from the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan as a testbed for the clash of arms on a scale unseen in Europe since the end of the Second World War. The Middle East is also highlighting the role of long-range missiles, air defence, urban warfare, and irregular or non-state forces with an ability to pose a threat to forces on land, in the air or at sea, as well as to target critical infrastructure. And the continued growth of the Chinese military is a modern case study in the development of armed forces with an assumed focus on challenging a superpower in a war that will be fought in all environments over a vast area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning lessons is not as straightforward as it might be, given the human tendency to fall prey to biases such as anchoring around pre-conceived ideas and recency, as well as the difficulty in identifying long-term trends based on snapshots of incomplete information. But it seems plausible to advance several arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK can do some things well, but not at a particularly impressive scale when the adversary is a state with significant military power of its own which is prepared to suffer losses&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, numbers matter. Firepower and destructive force are the overarching measures of a force’s combat output, and military power is about threatening to use or actually using force to destroy things and kill or coerce people. The war in Ukraine has seen casualties and losses of equipment on a scale consistent with previous major wars, but which boggle the mind in a modern context. The Russian invasion force in Ukraine now numbers over half a million after an estimated 460,000 killed or wounded. It has lost thousands of tanks and armoured vehicles. The artillery duel has seen requirements for shells reach as high as 7,000 a day for the Ukrainians on the offensive. Looking across to the Middle East, Iran used nearly 200 cruise missiles and drones in its attack on Israel, and in firing 110 ballistic missiles, it assembled the largest single salvo of such weapons seen in the past 40 years, other than in the first 48 hours of the Russian attack on Ukraine in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers not only matter for combat output, but also for the resilience of countries in war, their industrial capacity and their ability to sustain a campaign. The Russian “special operation” was supposed to be short, lasting days not years, but Sir Lawrence Freedman has written compellingly about the (seductive) myth of the “knockout blow”, and Ukraine provides an ample modern reminder. It is obvious but bears re-stating: industrial war is protracted and costly, more so when national survival is on the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in such a conflict, militaries are stressed across the full range of their capabilities and not just the combat arms. The oft-quoted line about amateurs, professionals and logistics is well-worn, but warranted. Militaries that can’t resupply and sustain themselves have no endurance, and precision or one-shot firepower is of little use if it can’t achieve repeated success, especially in major war. RUSI has written recently about the challenges of land logistics on the front-line, but the same is true of being able to resupply navies at sea, and to ferry weapons to air forces who have to conduct strikes repeatedly. Logistics supply chains and capabilities need to be either very rapid or integrated into the combat force (ideally both) and capable of surviving in modern combat environments, with pervasive surveillance and long-range weapons able to strike in shortening timelines. The force that cannot be sustained can’t fight for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-and-whose-army&quot;&gt;You and Whose Army?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can the UK’s Armed Forces put together such a force for modern warfare? The answer, at least in the eyes of the UK Parliament’s Defence Committee, as well as some recently responsible for testing Defence planning, would appear to be no. The trend of the past 35 years has been to trade numbers for sophistication, but this has overall led to a diminution of total firepower. The UK can do some things well, but not at a particularly impressive scale when the adversary is a state with significant military power of its own which is prepared to suffer losses. Even a recent defence secretary admitted that the forces had been “hollowed out” over a period of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the carrier strike group; this represents a sovereign UK capability, with a full range of aircraft and vessels deployed. But in the case of the Royal Navy, a “full fat” carrier group comprises almost the totality of the deployable Royal Navy. Two Type 23 frigates and two Type 45 destroyers would – on most days – be all that the current Navy could sustain for major operations beyond an additional frigate as the Fleet Ready Escort for home waters. Protecting it with a hunter-killer submarine would also be taxing, given the UK generally only has one or two deployed at any given time. Meanwhile, the slow buildup of the F-35B force means there are enough pilots currently qualified for carrier operations for a single squadron (hopefully soon to be two). Each jet represents a potent stealth aircraft, able to evade enemy air defences. But a closer look at the programme gives us pause to consider the combat output of each jet. If it is operating within range of hostile air defences, it will only be using its internal weapons bay; it is currently only able to carry Paveway IV guided bombs and air-to-air missiles, so no stand-off weapons are available to strike ground targets. The missiles being developed under SPEAR Capability 3 won’t be integrated with F-35 until “the end of the decade”. Additionally, it only has room for two such bombs, and as it would be risky to allocate one bomb to any given target, the best each jet can be expected to strike is a single target of modest size given the 500 lb payload of each Paveway. In other words, the current entire output of the carrier wing in a single set of sorties is 8–12 targets, assuming 100% aircraft availability and success rate. For a demonstration of intent, as part of a coalition operation, this might suffice, but in a genuine state war of attrition, this is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when RUSI analysts last looked at the Army, and the combat division the UK claims to have, it measured the number of main battle tanks and self-propelled artillery in the UK’s inventory and found the numbers wanting when set against a “credible” armoured division of anywhere from 170 to over 300 tanks and around 110 to 220 artillery pieces. The numbers have not improved in the subsequent four years: under the Challenger 3 programme the UK will have a total of 148 main battle tanks (in 2030). Meanwhile, the UK has essentially removed the AS90 artillery from service by donating 32 to Ukraine, replacing them with 14 Archer guns until such time as the “Mobile Fires Platform” is procured (some time “this decade”). The Challenger 3 may be the “most lethal tank” ever fielded by the British Army, but it is going to be available in such limited numbers that it will have to perform heroically in the face of a notional foe in the form of Russian ground forces, such as a Combined Arms Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tooth-to-tail-sustaining-the-combat-force&quot;&gt;Tooth to Tail: Sustaining the Combat Force&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the industrial capacity modern states need to go to war, and the volume of ammunition or fuel consumed, forces in combat require the ability to move supplies around, to conduct surveillance to target the enemy, and to use other systems such as electronic warfare to ensure that their weapons can reach their targets and their forces can communicate. For the UK, the picture here is no less problematic in terms of the gap between aspiration and reality. RUSI experts assess that for the Army to deploy a single armoured brigade would require the commitment of around 70 to 80% of its total combat engineering capabilities in order to cross gaps and rivers or to breach minefields. The notion that the UK has enough to properly deploy a full division is fanciful. Meanwhile, manoeuvring this force successfully will require effective coordination via secure modern communications. Unfortunately, the Army will have to once again extend its obsolete Bowman system because of delays to MORPHEUS, already late and now possibly another decade from proper service. It may also come as a surprise to a generation weaned on popular culture’s pervasive use of spy satellites to learn that the UK is wholly dependent on others for space-based imagery; the ISTARI network is in development, but won’t start launching until 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once deployed, ground forces need protecting, especially from air attack. But the UK has a tiny number of Sky Sabre systems currently available; while public debate has focused on the (wholly unnecessary) idea of an “Iron Dome” across the UK, the more pertinent question would be who is defending UK land forces if they face an enemy air threat: at the moment this would have to be done by partners or the RAF (which lacks the ability to suppress sophisticated enemy air defences).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It will take novel thinking and the development of doctrine and tactics to achieve increased combat output and effect&amp;amp;nbsp;with forces that appear unlikely to increase in terms of personnel&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use of air power requires also effective coordination. The RAF has replaced its ageing E-3D Sentry airborne early warning aircraft with the E-7 Wedgetail. However, these won’t start being in service until 2025, and the UK is only buying three; this doesn’t even guarantee 24-hour availability (a “task line”) of a single aircraft, once again putting the emphasis on partners and ensuring that each aircraft is irreplaceable. Meanwhile, the RAF has also retired its C-130 Hercules transport fleet, to be replaced by the A-400M Atlas aircraft. This is more capable in terms of the payload it can carry individually, but with smaller numbers in the replacement force compared to the original C-130 force, just sustaining the same number of task lines will require much improved aircraft availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the carrier strike group, the UK ability to sustain it over long distances relies on a single Fleet Solid Support Ship, RFA Fort Victoria. When that is in maintenance (or if it were destroyed in a war), the UK has no backup and must rely on others. It is at least being replaced by three new ships, but they are not due to arrive in service until 2031 (and one of the industrial partners involved in their construction is now in financial difficulties).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;less-than-the-sum-of-its-parts&quot;&gt;Less than the Sum of its Parts?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are but a selection of the issues facing the modern UK Armed Forces in terms of combat power, before we even consider recruitment, retention, training and other personnel issues. The conclusion should not be one of despair, or that the UK does not have capable people and equipment. But it has tried to pursue a classic “full spectrum” of capabilities, and found itself stretched thin beyond the point where it can deploy fully integrated and credible forces that could fight in a modern war for any length of time. The choices available to the government have therefore been constrained, such that the UK can make a decent contribution to a coalition force in terms of specific capabilities, but it can’t provide a sizeable fully coherent force commensurate with its status as the (now) third-largest spender in NATO without the support of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solutions are available, but they will require hard thinking and prioritisation. In some cases, increased firepower will be desirable. But it may be that the UK should be investing in sustainment and enablers like bridging equipment before purchasing a single additional tank or jet that it can’t, in any case, deploy and support. Technology should play a key role – for example, learning the lessons about where drones can complement artillery and provide effective local surveillance. But it will take novel thinking and the development of doctrine and tactics, allied to new training, to achieve increased combat output – and effect – with forces that appear unlikely to increase in terms of personnel. More radical choices about improving output – for example, through the use of uncrewed systems, or AI to make sense of information and take decisions – should also be considered. In addition, the UK will need to decide where it provides a sovereign advantage that acts as a force multiplier for the rest of NATO, and where it will create tough, capable, fully integrated forces that do not create obligations for other NATO Allies. Otherwise, the UK’s claim to be a leading country in NATO will be undermined by a military providing less than the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（5日）踏入第47日審訊。控方表示已完成舉證，由於辯方需時向被告索取指示，以決定是否作供或傳召辯方證人，因此法官張慧玲將案件押後至下周一（8日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警員稱若沒有裝置密碼-或未能成功擷取資料&quot;&gt;警員稱若沒有裝置密碼 或未能成功擷取資料&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方應辯方要求，傳召警員7401洪子安（音譯），他負責檢驗李家田被捕時搜獲的電子器材。洪確認於2007年加入警隊，就本案於2020年8月為李家田的 iPhone 6 及 iPad 作出法理鑑證，即將電子裝置連接修復程式 Cellebrite，以擷取當中的資料。在代表李家田的大律師林芷瑩盤問下，洪確認「O記」同事有將電話及 iPad 密碼給予他，他在連接程式後輸入密碼，之後再擷取資料。被問到若未能輸入正確密碼，能否擷取資料；洪表示可能做不到，並導致程序不能繼續，要視乎有否其他方法。他亦同意曾經出現未能成功擷取的情況。控方其後播放各被告行蹤的閉路電視片段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示已傳召所有證人，並完成舉證。案件下周一（8日）續審，以待辯方向被告索取指示，決定是否作供或傳召辯方證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（5日）處理第三批被告、6名九龍東初選參與者的求情，包括認罪的黃之鋒、譚文豪、李嘉達、譚得志、胡志偉，及受審後罪成的施德來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;繼續有人通宵排隊，排頭位是旁聽常客「姨婆」及其外甥，於前一晚10時多到場。凌晨近2時，警員逐一搜查排隊者的隨身物品及身分證。凌晨4時左右，陸續有更多人前來排隊，有人攜來雪條和凍飲，給徹夜排隊的人降溫。天還未亮，隊伍已有近40人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hQCLyJf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;譚文豪的友人梁小姐在凌晨三時許乘Uber到達。她說已三年沒見過譚，但有寫信，非常掛念他，故今日特意請假前來，「一定要入到去！」她又笑言，原本打算在等候期間寫信，但因太疲倦而未有落筆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/R995SKb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 梁小姐&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁小姐每日都有關注初選案進展。她留意到早前報導指早上已有數十人排隊，「即係入唔到啦！」，所以今日目標是比「排隊黨」早到。她形容譚是目標明確、非常堅毅的人，希望祝他一切安好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xuy3ocO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;凌晨4時多到場的黃小姐則希望探望「快必」譚得志。她表示，自己曾為快必助選，自他入獄後有寫信和探監，對上一次見他是今年4月。她認為，快必不願屈服的精神難得，但嘆現時連旁聽亦有白色恐怖，因有機會被搜袋、查問個人資料等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xIZdkd0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（5日）處理第三批共6名被告的求情，包括前香港眾志袐書長黃之鋒、資深民主派胡志偉和「快必」譚得志、前立法會議員譚文豪、前觀塘區議員李嘉達及前黃大仙區議員施德來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;開庭前約三小時，前觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻與兩名前同事鄧先生和 Martin，一同現身旁聽隊伍。談到被告兼前同事李嘉達，鄧先生和 Martin 首先形容李是「有領導力、有諗法、有熱誠」的人，常有不同想法，想為社區帶來改變，又會定期做社區論壇，以不同方法與老人家溝通，增加居民社區意識；又大讚有與朋友組成樂隊的李唱歌好聽。蔡澤鴻就坦言，與李不算認識很久，但知道他很感性和細心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於李嘉達陷獄，鄧先生直言：「於心無愧就得㗎喇」，又望對他說：「出嚟一齊飲一打啤酒！一齊去合興食豬腸粉！」Martin 則說：「頂住啦！大家陪緊你喺度。」社工註冊條例修訂後，任社工的李嘉達要永久除牌，Martin 嘆可惜，指李是「有心嘅社工」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;嘆過往可不約而聚-今轉場探監聽審圍爐&quot;&gt;嘆過往可不約而聚 今「轉場」探監、聽審、圍爐&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除了李嘉達，任職區議員近30年的蔡澤鴻與其他九東被告，也起碼共事10年以上。其中，他與胡志偉是在1991年直選時相識，至今已30多年。蔡形容胡做事有原則，性格刻苦、堅持，現時約每月探望他一次；他又坦言因胡還柙已逾三年，探望時已經沒新鮮事可分享。不過他們仍常常說笑稱，以前再熟亦不會約見面，因為七一、六四等日子一定見到彼此：「見到就嘈，見唔到就『仆街，點解你唔嚟？』，完咗，啱嘅就一齊食飯。但宜家就冇喇，宜家轉咗場地。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8xh4oQY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡澤鴻嘆，嘆無論對牆內或牆外人而言，最難受是不可預計：「起碼我知要坐幾耐，有個期。宜家係無了期。」23條生效後，他預料初選案的被告不會有行為良好扣減三分一刑期，故即使樂觀估算，他相信要待2027年才見到他們出獄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡又說，留下來的人之所以不開心或有很多情緒，其中一個原因是「我哋仲緊張，我哋仲 care 呢個地方嘅一啲嘢」。蔡續說，「我諗每個人都可以諗吓，自己喺自己嘅崗位上可以做啲乜嘢」，像他可以多些探監、聽審，朋友之間也可以多圍爐，「畀大家知道我哋原來仲喺度」，就像他會與以往九龍東的同事隔數個月也會吃飯、「圍爐」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡最後寄語眾被告「希望唔好死住」，並直言現時「唯一可以做就係支援佢哋，同埋畀佢哋見到我哋仲喺度，我冇避到，大家都係一齊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（5日）處理第三批被告、6名九龍東初選參與者的求情，包括認罪的黃之鋒、譚文豪、李嘉達、譚得志、胡志偉，及受審後罪成的施德來。多人久未露面，譚文豪和李嘉達消瘦不少，快必譚得志多了不少白頭髮，不住向旁聽席戚眉和露出笑容，至於黃之鋒則被安排獨自坐在離旁聽席最遠的角落，由懲教隔開他和其他被告。代表黃之鋒的大律師李國威先進行求情，黃曾提及國際游說和簽署「墨落無悔」，但無參與組織初選，屬「積極參加者」，並望法庭考慮他以往曾就多宗案件服刑、參與公共服務而酌情減刑。辯方又呈上黃之鋒母親、教會牧師和老師的求情信，黃本人則無撰寫求情信，辯方指這是其選擇，指黃希望在本案後重新開始（move on）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃之鋒與其他被告相隔-快必頻向旁聽戚眉發笑&quot;&gt;黃之鋒與其他被告相隔 快必頻向旁聽戚眉發笑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪、周天行、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋。黃之鋒由大律師李國威代表；譚文豪由資深大律師何沛謙代表；李嘉達由大律師陳德昌代表；譚得志由大律師梁寶琳代表；胡志偉由大律師郭子丰代表；施德來由大律師黃廷光代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;各被告於10時前陸續步入法庭，與律師溝通，其後由6名懲教分隔就坐。其中黃之鋒一人坐在離旁聽席最遠的被告欄角落，與其他被告相隔4名懲教人員、以及囚室門前的走廊。其餘5人則坐在被告欄中央和靠近旁聽席的位置。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NrTvEuQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此前獲保釋、其後被裁罪成還柙的施德來，穿淺藍色裇衫，向旁聽的妻子微笑點頭。至於已還柙至今逾3年4個月的另外5人，黃之鋒穿深藍色裇衫、深灰色針織外套，向旁聽席點頭。快必譚得志梳中分髮型、多了不少白頭髮，身穿達明一派演唱會「REPLAY」T裇、外穿花紋短袖襯衫，入庭時笑着摸頭髮，又向旁聽席張開雙手和揮手，又指着自己的襯衫擺姿勢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;消瘦了不少、有不少白頭髮的譚文豪，戴黑框眼鏡和口罩，身穿白色裇衫、深藍色西裝外套，並在聆訊時除下口罩。胡志偉亦戴眼鏡、穿摺起至中袖的白色裇衫，向旁聽席揮手。李嘉達穿灰藍色西裝外套及褲、白襯衫，手捧文件，看見親友後面露笑容和揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;各被告就坐後，快必一度與相隔數米外的黃之鋒交談，黃說：「Cat. A（甲級犯）呀！」，快必又主動與胡志偉和施德來談話。快必聆訊期間不住對旁聽席擠眉弄眼、發笑，又豎起拇指。黃之鋒則單手持耳機，不時托頭望向旁聽席，又低頭抄寫。譚文豪則坐得畢直，專注望向前方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;民主黨前主席劉慧卿、副主席莫建成，社民連曾健成、陳寶瑩，前觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻、前黃大仙區議員張茂清等均有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃之鋒屬積極參加者&quot;&gt;辯方：黃之鋒屬「積極參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃之鋒的大律師李國威進行求情陳詞。就黃的角色，李認為應屬「積極參加者」，雖其簽署「墨落無悔」聲明為加刑因素，但黃在案發期間只是參與者，沒有參與組織或協助初選進行，望由法庭決定適合的量刑起點。李又指黃及早認罪，應獲三分一扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李承認黃競選時提到「國際戰線」、到美國等地游說等，但指涉案謀劃屬本土事件，尋求外國支持為2019年運動的大環境，與本案控罪無關，亦不屬《國安法》第30條提到涉勾結外國勢力顛覆國家政權的情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃曾就多案服刑-望考慮整體原則酌情扣減&quot;&gt;辯方：黃曾就多案服刑 望考慮整體原則酌情扣減&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，黃之鋒曾因數宗非法集結及未經批准集結案服刑，望法庭判刑時考慮整體量刑原則（totality principle），運用酌情權扣減部分刑期。翻查資料，黃之鋒涉2019年6月21日號召包圍警總，承認「煽惑他人明知而參與未經批准集結」及「組織未經批准集結」，判監13個半月；同年10月5日，涉銅鑼灣參與未經批准集結及違禁蒙面法，承認控罪判監4個月；2020年六四參與維園集會，承認參與未經批准集結罪，判監8個月。黃另涉轉載西灣河開槍警及家人資料，承認藐視法庭，判監3個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示，黃承認他被控的所有控罪，望法庭能調整量刑起點或作出減刑。法官陳仲衡指，但黃此前已承受罪責，法庭並不會給他額外的扣減。李同意黃之鋒於保釋期間干犯本案為加刑因素，但望法庭能酌情判刑，以免造成壓毀性影響（crushing effect）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃無寫求情信-望本案後重新開始&quot;&gt;辯方：黃無寫求情信 望本案後重新開始&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就黃的個人背景，辯方呈上其母親、老師及教會牧師的求情信，指黃希望在服刑後放下過去，改過自新（part with his past history and be able to reform himself）。法官陳仲衡指，那是其他人代表黃之鋒說的話，而不是黃自己親口說。李同意黃沒有寫任何求情信，指這是他的選擇，但重申其指示是黃之鋒希望本案後重新開始（move on after this offence）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OZtc8Y1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後提到，黃在疫情期間即使沒有任何公職，亦搜購了150萬個口罩。法官陳仲衡指相關因素已被其他法官考慮，故「我們不能循環再用」。李表示，這顯示黃持續幫助其他人。法官陳仲衡指，不能將黃視作有良好品格，因他有案底；法官李運騰亦質疑，相關因素於另案已考慮，不能因此給予額外扣減。李重申，不是要求額外扣減，只是顯示黃一直積極幫助社區的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（5日）處理第三批被告、6名九龍東初選參與者的求情。代表前公民黨立法會議員譚文豪的資深大律師何沛謙表示，譚出身草根，從政只想回饋社會，並非激進政客；他曾多次贊成政府撥款，沒有無差別否決，更獲政府官員私信感謝。辯方又指，譚辭任立法會議員和退黨後，已完全離開政壇，譚還柙至今逾3年，望過新生活，彌補與家人包括龍鳳胎子女相處的時間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又透露，譚曾於2021年下半年自願錄口供，提及如果知道會犯法，「我係絕對唔會參加呢個初選」，辯方強調他當時不知道「紅線」在哪裡；庭上又讀出譚親撰的求情信，提及望向法庭表達對過去言行深感悔疚，並「希望公開向香港社會各界以及中央政府真誠道歉」。辯方認為，譚屬「積極參加者」，望法庭考慮他對香港貢獻和真誠悔意而減刑。翻查資料，譚的一對子女將於本月中迎來10歲生日。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方譚出身草根非激進政客-只盼回饋社會&quot;&gt;辯方：譚出身草根、非激進政客 只盼回饋社會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃之鋒一方今早求情完畢，其後由譚文豪一方求情。代表譚的資深大律師何沛謙表示，譚文豪出身於草根家庭，其父親為的士司機，譚靠其努力於澳洲修讀機械及太空工程，並成為一名民航機師。譚自2016年當選立法會議員後開始從政，他並非為個人名利或榮譽、也從沒有意圖成為激進政客，只是想回饋社會，令香港成為一個更好的地方、一個更關愛的社區。何指，譚過去曾在多個範疇服務，如他曾撰寫一本有關機師的書，並設立獎學金予望成為機師的年輕人，他對年青人和社會有真誠的熱情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方引投票紀錄-指譚文豪支持撥款曾獲官員私信感謝&quot;&gt;辯方引投票紀錄 指譚文豪支持撥款、曾獲官員私信感謝&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又引用譚文豪過往的立法會投票紀錄，指他多次支持政府撥款申請，並於2020年6月至7月初選進行得如火如荼之際，仍與其他議員合作，在立法會會期完結前，盡力通過最多民生議案。辯方又引政府官員與譚的對話，提及當時能通過相關撥款屬「奇蹟」，該名官員並回覆「非常感激」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡說，辯方所述的表現，是一般市民期望立法會議員有的表現，不能作為良好品格的求情因素；又指重要的不是譚以往如何投票，而是他是否無差別投票。何指譚正正沒有無差別反對，而是真誠支持民生議案，強調他非常認真、盡責履行議員職責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉再指，辯方所述只是譚在該個會期的行為，但本案關乎在下屆議會無差別否決，譚亦已認罪。何強調，當時是2020年7月，正值初選的時候；又強調「行動比說話重要」，望能呈現譚較全面和正確的形象，而非僅如庭上證供所述。何又指，譚毫不激進，法官陳慶偉即指「但他的黨非常、非常激進」，李運騰亦指，鄭達鴻供稱譚文豪在公民黨3月25日記者會前的籌備會議上，提議「搶韁」。（編按：此為區諾軒寫予鄭達鴻信中的形容）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方譚望與親人團聚已完全離開政壇&quot;&gt;辯方：譚望與親人團聚、已完全離開政壇&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何沛謙續指，譚文豪現已還柙逾3年，望能建立新生活，彌補他所失去與家人包括妻子、龍鳳胎子女和母親相處的時間。而譚曾開設茶餐廳，但其後因疫情結業，其妻子因照顧家庭未能找到全職工作，譚感到很抱歉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又指，譚2020年11月辭任議員後，其政治生涯已完結，並於2021年3月退出公民黨，同年4月公開呼籲公民黨解散，完全離開政壇，足見其真誠悔意，沒有重犯機會。而譚在還柙期間成為基督徒，又修讀會計和企業管理課程，名列前茅，正裝備自己彌補過失、尋找新職涯。辯方又呈上多封求情信，讚揚譚謙卑、溫柔，是真誠和務實的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指譚曾自願錄口供-稱如知犯法絕不會參加初選&quot;&gt;辯方指譚曾自願錄口供 稱如知犯法絕不會參加初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，最大求情因素是譚文豪及早認罪，甚至在看過同意案情前已表明會認罪；又指他在2021年下半年曾自願進行警誡錄影會面，談及自己的參與。法官陳仲衡問是否招認的證供，法官陳慶偉表示不肯定，但肯定是「自利（self-serving）」的證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續引述譚當時稱：「如果知道當然啦，你問返我轉頭，我係絕對唔會參加呢個初選，如果我哋知道係會犯法嘅話」，指這是他當時真誠的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何強調，當時初選有很多不確定和困惑，無人知道「紅線」在哪裡，而公民黨在《國安法》頒布後曾開會及修改政綱，盡量遠離紅線，雖然事後看來知道所做的是錯誤，但法庭不應從事後去裁斷被告，而應審視他案發時的真實心態，強調譚並非公然違反法律的「頑固分子（diehard）」，而是嘗試符合法律，站在正確的一邊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方量刑時不應考慮國安法前言行&quot;&gt;辯方：量刑時不應考慮《國安法》前言行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就量刑原則，何沛謙指法庭應考慮涉案謀劃存在的不確定性，又指《國安法》沒有追溯力、被告此前行為並非違法，法庭考慮被告角色和判刑時，不應考慮其在《國安法》前的言行，只能以相關言行判斷涉案謀劃是否存在、以及被告有否參與。至於被告的罪責，辯方主張應考慮《國安法》後的實際行為，例如參加初選、參與選舉論壇和提交提名表格。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰不止一次提到，控方並非說《國安法》前行為是犯法，但問題是相關言行能否作為背景判斷串謀協議的規模和被告的參與程度；法官陳慶偉則指，法庭已表明認為《國安法》前行為與判刑相關。何重申，只能用相關行為確立被告有罪，但不能用以考慮判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方譚為積極參加者&quot;&gt;辯方：譚為「積極參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，認為譚文豪屬「積極參加者」，並在法官追問下，指可考慮3項行為量刑，包括譚於《國安法》後參與選舉論壇、參加初選及提交選舉提名表格。法官陳慶偉指，這樣的話就沒有行為顯示其顛覆意圖，何強調，《國安法》前行為是合法，而《國安法》後譚的行為，僅在參與一個已成立的謀劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，譚文豪為「民主動力」的執行委員會委員，民主動力協助初選舉行。何沛謙表示，民動並非為初選而設，只是泛民一個很鬆散的組織，約一年開一次會，而趙家賢決定參與初選前，並沒有諮詢譚文豪等成員，譚沒有參與管理民動，其在民動的角色與本案無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;譚文豪求情信望向社會各界及中央政府真誠道歉&quot;&gt;譚文豪求情信：望向社會各界及中央政府真誠道歉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何最後重申，望法庭考慮譚對香港的貢獻、及早認罪、真誠悔意而酌情減刑，並以譚求情信最後一句作結：「在此我希望向法庭表達，我對過去的言行深感悔疚，希望公開向香港社會各界以及中央政府真誠道歉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方完成求情後，萬德豪補充，針對譚所作的錄影會面，並不是對其參與角色的正確描述。法官李運騰指那沒有關係，被告認罪已獲三分一扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pzV6gWb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（5日）處理第三批被告、6名九龍東初選參與者的求情。代表前觀塘區議員李嘉達的大律師陳德昌指，李屬「積極參加者」較低級別，望以3年至6年半為量刑起點。陳續指，李曾任社工，2019年目睹年青人感無力沮喪，遂決定成為區議員，其後望投身更大政治舞台改變現況，遂參與初選，事後回看屬錯誤。辯方又指，李還柙3年4個月已付上代價，其女友曾提議結婚，但他望對方等待自己出獄，以辦正式婚禮。雖然李被定罪後無法再成為社工，但有非政府機構願在李獲釋後聘請他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後提到，今午與李會面時，李提及自兩年前認罪後，一直未有離開過赤柱監獄，而他今天往法院途上，看到外面樹木翠綠、陽光燦爛、天空蔚藍，一切令人提起精神。辯方指李已改變，他表明會離開政治，邁向人生新階段，繼續服務社會。李庭上聞言一度落淚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方李嘉達屬積極參加者-量刑起點不超6年半&quot;&gt;辯方：李嘉達屬「積極參加者」 量刑起點不超6年半&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃之鋒及譚文豪完成求情後，由李嘉達一方求情。代表李嘉達的大律師陳德昌指，在刑期分級上，李應該屬「積極參加者」的較低級別，並非最嚴重的一種，建議以3至6年半監禁為量刑起點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就李的背景，陳指他1992年在內地出生，現年33歲，為家中獨子。李3歲時來港定居，在工人階層家庭成長，居於觀塘。李在中學的成績優異，曾於2008年汶川大地震期間為災民發起籌款，其後入讀香港大學社會工作系，並於2013年畢業，同年成為註冊社工。陳指，李被定罪後難再成為社工，但不會形容為「世界末日」，因他會找到其他方式服務社會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，《社會工作者註冊條例》修訂今刊憲生效，犯危害國安罪的人將永久除牌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方李望改變現況故參與初選-卻犯下錯誤&quot;&gt;辯方：李望改變現況故參與初選 卻犯下錯誤&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，李曾在學校擔任社工，並向特殊教育需要（SEN）學生教授戲劇。陳續略為哽咽提到，有學生家長撰寫非常感動的感謝信予李，讚揚在李的努力下，其子女變得更願意打開自己。陳形容李對工作充滿熱誠，盡心服務兒童，表現出色。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，李進修關於表達藝術治療的碩士學位，直至2019年，李目睹社會情況導致年青人感無力和沮喪，於是決定成為區議員，冀回應他們的關注，影響更多人。李成為區議員數個月後，決定投身更大的政治平台，以改變當時的情況，於是提交初選表格。陳形容李因此步入了黑暗（dark side），開始走向下坡，事後回看是犯下了錯誤。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方李盼出獄後結婚有ngo願聘用&quot;&gt;辯方：李盼出獄後結婚、有NGO願聘用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳強調，李及早認罪並承認全部案情，顯示最大的悔意，應該獲得充足的刑期扣減。而李還柙期間，其女友曾提議結婚，但李希望等待至自己出獄，以舉辦正式的婚禮，邀請親友觀禮。辯方亦呈上41封求情信，來自李本人、女友、家人、中學校長、大學教授和同學、任職社工時的服務對象、觀塘區街坊及教會。有非政府機構表明願意聘請李作為研究助理，並保留職位待他出獄再聘請。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，李還柙3年4個月，已經付上代價。他還柙期間祖母不幸離世，其女友等待他成婚，亦有一份工作等待他，是一個誤入歧途的好人（a good man went to the dark side）。辯方指，李表明會離開政壇，望出獄後能夠展開新生活，找尋方法以社工、戲劇導師和治療師的身分，繼續服務社會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方引李嘉達談近況-李一度落淚&quot;&gt;辯方引李嘉達談近況 李一度落淚&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳最後指，今天午膳時間時曾會見李，李說自2022年6月認罪後，已沒有離開過赤柱監獄。陳問及有何不一樣，李提到前往法院途中，看到「樹木翠綠，陽光燦爛，天空蔚藍，一切都令人提起精神」。（“The trees are green, the sun is bright, the sky is blue, everything is very refreshing for me.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示對此感到驚訝，因自己有時會到赤柱，但卻從沒有留意。陳強調，李已經改過自新，知道生命中重要的東西，並望邁向人生新階段，服務社會。陳提起這段對話時，李嘉達頻頻眨眼、流下眼淚，並用手擦拭，離開法庭時他向旁聽席再揮手，並以紙巾拭鼻。辯方申請李明日不到庭獲批。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，胡志偉微笑向旁聽席雙手合十、做致敬手勢，快必在進入囚室前伸直手臂做出心心動作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5ioXIRd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（4日）踏入第46日審訊。負責數碼法理鑑證的警長吳曉曦接受辯方盤問時，承認 Cellebrite 程式未能修復部分已刪除訊息，因有關訊息會呈現不明符號，未能解讀。他又同意未能與原本的訊息核對是否完整。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;負責數碼法理鑑證的警長吳曉曦，昨日就修復程式 Cellebrite 提供專家意見，他今繼續接受代表賴振邦的大律師余承熹盤問。吳同意在 Telegram 程式中，若把對話欄向左拉的話，可以將對話刪除。至於在群組內，則只可刪除用戶本人發送的訊息。吳又指，Cellebrite 程式修復已被刪除訊息後，會顯示該訊息是用上述哪一方式刪除。另外，吳同意事前有用樣本電話作為測試，以檢查程式能否修復已刪除訊息。不過吳表示案發時的2020年，Cellebrite 尚未能顯示轉發的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳昨同意 Cellebrite 並非「萬能」，只可以完成其能力範圍內的修復。辯方舉出例子，指未能解讀部分由已刪除訊息轉換成的不明符號；吳同意上述說法，且承認未能與原本的訊息核對是否完整。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;廉署技術部職員稱滅龍群組內的聊天紀錄被設為可見&quot;&gt;廉署技術部職員稱「滅龍」群組內的聊天紀錄被設為可見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方傳召另一證人、於廉政公署技術服務部訊號分析組工作的衛智文。她就被告電話內其中一個經緯度資料作出調查，並在 Google Maps 輸入以查看相應地點。衛接受代表張銘裕的大律師姚本成盤問，她確認群組內只可以由擁有人或管理員刪除其他人的訊息，但刪除之後並不能還原。另外，代表李家田的大律師林芷瑩問到，若用戶曾經離開群組再被加入，他能否看到這段期間的訊息。衛表示視乎管理員將聊天紀錄設為可見（visible）還是隱藏（hidden）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在代表賴振邦的大律師是香媛盤問下，衛同意於2023年作測試時，使用當年的最新版本，但與案發時的2020年版本有別，不過運作上沒有太大改變。另外，衛同意若電話已登入 Apple ID，任何人可以用電話安裝 Telegram。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在代表劉佩凝的大律師馬維騉盤問下，衛同意沒有看過牽涉本案的訊息或截圖。她表示一個帳戶可以由不同電話號碼共用，而其他登入者也可以看到帳戶的訊息。辯方問到若帳戶由3人共用，一人已查閱他人傳來的訊息，另兩人會否仍看到訊息通知；衛表示沒有測試過，故不知道。衛又指，若其中一人與第三方用戶開設「secret chat」，其餘兩人並不會知悉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，衛確認一旦用戶刪除自己發送的訊息，其他群組成員就不會看到。在控方覆問時，衛同意「滅龍」群組內的聊天紀錄被設置為可見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（5日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly nine long months into Israel’s war on Gaza, few topics remain as controversial as Israel’s targeting mechanisms, especially the reported use of several AI systems in its processes. Following the initial reports on “Gospel”, I argued that such a model has a more limited role in the targeting cycle. However, later reporting on models like “Lavender” challenged many assumptions, and raised further concerns about AI in Israel Defense Forces’ (IDF) decision-making roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless the IDF permits full access to its systems, we cannot fully gauge the veracity of reported claims, including the +972 Mag’s reporting, the facts of which remain contentious. In light of continued disagreement on the actual capabilities and roles of these systems, it is crucial to understand the many considerations of the targeting process and the many points of failure inherent in such a cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is neither an evaluation of the IDF’s legal targeting standards, an assessment of its operational efficacy in achieving war aims, nor a simple criticism of the staggering human cost imposed by the IDF upon the Gazan population. Instead, this piece outlines broadly how targeting cycles operate, including the critical points where technology could limit or expand civilian deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article will focus on procedures surrounding air-based targeted killings and dynamic strikes, to differentiate from fire support for ground forces. While targeting shares many of its aspects across military branches, it should be noted that IDF procedures, including targeting, are believed to differ across sectors and commanders in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intelligence-gathering-and-processing&quot;&gt;Intelligence Gathering and Processing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Gaza, Israel maintains one of the densest intelligence networks of any modern conflict zone, which has been built up since its occupation of the Strip. Gazan militants lack any real air defences, permitting crewed and uncrewed aircraft (both Israeli and non-Israeli) to perform near-constant surveillance, producing droves of electronic and communication intelligence. Other forms of intelligence collection include imaging from satellites, ground troops relaying operational information, and a variety of intelligence from Western governments. Combined with Palestinian data archives from decades of surveillance, the IDF possesses as close to perfect intelligence as possible in a modern combat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheer quantity of Israel’s intelligence could cripple its ability to translate data into actionable insights. Raw data from cameras, radar, phone data and other sensors must be sorted, cleaned and delegated to the appropriate places for “exploitation”. “Cleaning” this data manually would be impossible, so to minimise the number of human analysts and avoid fatigue-induced errors, AI is typically involved at this stage. Machine learning (ML) models can use pattern recognition to identify potentially relevant information from raw feeds, including persons or objects of interest, vehicle movements, or even rocket launches. The intel is typically translated into common formats which can be combined to present a holistic view of the battlespace for an analyst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the quantity of intelligence is positively correlated with accuracy and certainty in decision-making, an intelligence-sifting system which processes far greater quantities of data than a human analyst would reduce unintended casualties in the targeting cycle. However, this is only possible with a reliable system that avoids frequent false positives (hallucinations) while simultaneously not missing relevant intelligence (errors). The model would also likely exhibit the biases of the humans who created, trained and trialled the system, bottlenecking the intelligence that can be used at future stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Theoretically, the processing power of machine learning could empower analysts to make decisions with much higher accuracy, combining intelligence to provide a rigorous depiction of the potential target&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fine-tuning to avoid these inaccuracies would occur during the model’s training, but occasional mistakes are inevitable in any such system. Yet there has been no indication of processes to correct the model while in operational use (see below). Meanwhile, the +972 Mag’s reporting claims that Lavender’s apparent 10% misidentification rate is considered tolerable by the IDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intelligence-analysis&quot;&gt;Intelligence Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the cleaned data is aggregated, an analyst will search for actionable intelligence, either tracking previously banked targets or looking for specifically identifiable ones. Satellite images of weaponry/equipment, enemy faces in video feeds, and the location of specific radio signatures are all examples of intelligence that can lead to target creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis models would parse the cleaned data to recognise specific identifiers comparable to the processing systems, albeit with greater specialisation. Analysis might involve several models, each focused on a certain type of analysis, such as spectrum analysis, face recognition, vehicle/weapon identification or voice recognition, while machine outputs could range from basic intelligence profiles to actionable targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a binary selection, models would provide a likelihood of positive identification, which could be summarised as “X model identified X militant with a certainty of X%”. ML excels at this form of probabilistic pattern recognition and could ideally make the targeting process more transparent and accurate. However, these benefits hinge solely on how a potential model is employed. Even if the certainty is outputted for analysts (a simple matter for a model), the analyst and commander must understand how and why the model produced both the target and the certainty. Unless the certainty is near 100% for a given target (and hopefully even then), positive identification should be corroborated by other intelligence mediums, such as phone signals or human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the IDF likely has a threshold for determining whether a strike is warranted. With high-fidelity systems, a high threshold for identification would reduce the risk of civilian deaths due to target misidentification, while a low threshold could result in an effectively indiscriminate campaign against a population. This is arguably the point where human involvement is most important. Theoretically, the processing power of ML could empower analysts to make decisions with much higher accuracy, combining their various ML-enabled intelligence reports to provide a rigorous depiction of the potential target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigative reporting has cast doubt upon the image of a human-centred targeting process. According to these claims, human involvement is only a cursory check, lasting under a minute. The reasons for such a hurried, shallow review are likely a mix of automation bias, pressure to create/approve quantities of targets, and old-fashioned analyst fatigue. Similar considerations around errors, hallucinations, data quality and bias from the “processing” stage also apply for machine analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDF’s response claims that such a system is limited to intelligence management tools more akin to sophisticated intelligence-cleaning models, which output mere correlations in the data. Even if they are not using a target creation system (which would still reasonably fall under the category of “ecision support system”), analysts would need to understand how these tools autonomously collate intelligence on suspected militants, as well as the reliability of their correlational mechanisms. Still, the sheer number of targets struck by the IDF lends weight to the argument that humans are not fully creating, or at least thoroughly analysing, each target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;operational-planning&quot;&gt;Operational Planning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon the identification of a target, it is either added to a target bank to be monitored and struck at a later time, or sent up the chain of command for strike planning and approval. When choosing the most appropriate means for a strike, timing and location selections require the balancing of target vulnerability with risk to families or bystanders. Delivery platforms comprise crewed and uncrewed aircraft launching air-to-ground munitions, although planners would ideally choose from a variety of means, including ground-based fires or pinpoint raids using small arms. Acceptable limits on these factors are predefined as rules of engagement (ROE) for a specific operation or set of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ROE are often less stringent for dynamic strikes against targets of opportunity – typically those presenting an imminent threat and/or a limited window of opportunity. These strikes are not preplanned and are instead identified and struck in real time, reducing the time for collateral death estimates (CDE). The IDF apparently began shifting towards more dynamic strikes as it exhausted its previously banked targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When responding to criticism over civilian deaths from strikes, the IDF typically cites the use of “precision munitions”. However, precision does not equate to discrimination. A munition’s precision is simply its likelihood of hitting its intended target, so a precision munition is a guided bomb, rocket or shell with a high likelihood of striking its target. The controversial 2,000 GBU-31 bombs are precise when outfitted with the JDAM guidance kit, with the decrease in required munitions translating to less destruction, but this does not mean that strikes are discriminate. A discriminate strike is one that only hits the intended target. While it is extraordinarily difficult to conduct a strike in an urban environment with a 0% chance of collateral damage, the choice of a GBU-31 (or even the 1,000 lb GBU-32 or various 500 lb bombs) indicates intentional indiscrimination – the 900 kg munition has a lethal radius of hundreds of metres, and can create a crater several metres deep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Munition selection also depends on the availability of different munitions. Despite their greater payload and therefore less discriminate nature, large, air-dropped munitions are typically the first choice of munition due to their price point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key to understanding the IDF’s operational planning is the value it places upon the lives of its soldiers relative to Palestinian civilians. Especially compared to US and allied militaries, the IDF appears to be willing to inflict immense cost upon civilians to reduce the risk to its soldiers. The preference for air strikes over ground, even at the risk of increased collateral damage, is driven by decades of Palestinian dehumanisation, combined with intense domestic pressure to protect Israel’s conscripted population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains unknown whether the IDF’s ML systems are used during the operational planning stage or during dynamic targeting. In theory, systems could incorporate ROE to predict a strike’s impact for an analyst, akin to the reporting on Lavender and “Fire Factory”. The IDF also claim that the models generate CDE, the accuracy of which – given the sophistication of Israeli intelligence – there is no reason to doubt, regardless of whether it is generated by a human expert or a machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, a model for operational planning would provide the user with the ability to visualise the civilian impact of different munition and location choices faster than humanly possible, which – when combined with proper Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) adherence – would lower civilian deaths or cause the cancellation of a strike altogether. In this manner, the model would not be treated as a replacement for a human analyst, but as an operational planning tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;legal-considerations-and-commander-approval&quot;&gt;Legal Considerations and Commander Approval&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece seeks to sidestep the many legal debates about both Israel’s right to respond militarily and its wider conduct in the war, instead focusing on the considerations surrounding a single strike. During the operational planning and command approval stages, legal considerations about a strike determine compliance with LOAC. The legality of any individual strike (given jus ad bellum) rests mainly on the concept of proportionality. Given proportionality’s subjective nature, the legality of killing civilians remains a contested concept in LOAC, demonstrating the tension between legality and morality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides proportionality, an attacker must undertake “feasible measures to minimise harm to civilians” when undertaking strikes against enemy targets. Historically, the IDF often undertook several types of warnings prior to its strikes to get civilians out of harm’s way. Even besides the mixed success of these measures, they cannot obfuscate the high rate of civilian deaths per strike compared to other conflicts. This highlights the lack of numerous other feasible precautions, such as the operational considerations in munition selection and timing discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the case of the IDF, it seems clear that it has used AI systems not to refine targeting, but to expand and expedite its target cycle&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every state – including the “most moral army in the world” – must abide by LOAC, regardless of an enemy’s violations of international law. Additionally, the embedding of an insurgent force within a population is not a new phenomenon and does not absolve the IDF of its LOAC commitments. The presence of human shields or hostages does not change the fact that these are civilians, who must be treated as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear how Israel applies these legal considerations in its targeting cycle. Traditionally, a legal advisor (a Military Advocate General’s Corps officer [MAG] in the IDF) is consulted during operational planning, but given the sheer quantity of airstrikes conducted – especially at the beginning of the war – the likelihood that a judge advocate rigorously examined every single strike is low. Consequently, “legal advising” might merely comprise checking “yes” or “no” to decide whether the predicted deaths are consistent with “acceptable” rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The claim in the +972 Mag’s reporting thus begins to look more likely, with commanders relying on a “predetermined and fixed collateral damage degree” rather than in-depth proportionality assessments for each strike. These are values given to commanders indicating the maximum “acceptable” number of civilians who can be killed as collateral in a strike. A commander can exceed this number for a high-value target only with approval from higher levels of command. The number differs depending on the target; for example, it is allegedly 15–20 civilians per “low-ranking militant” and over 100 civilians for a more senior commander. The use of a discrete value has precedent, such as the US’s “non-combatant casualty cut-off value” in Iraq and Afghanistan, although it remains controversial due to the subjective valuation of some lives over others and the high discrepancy between the number of civilian deaths considered tolerable by Western militaries and the IDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the questions about if and how models generate collateral estimates, all other responsibility at this stage rests on human actors. Any programming of LOAC into the models is unlikely due both to the complex, often abstract reasoning required as well as the continued misgivings about military AI from the legal community. Instead, a commander must understand the logic and evidence behind any strike recommendations, regardless of whether they are created by an analyst or model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;post-operation-assessment&quot;&gt;Post-Operation Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any strike or operation requires a post-mortem to understand what went right and what went wrong. Battle damage assessments determine whether the strike was successful at eliminating the target, while analysts conduct collateral damage assessments to ensure greater civilian protection in future strikes (assuming they are directed at only ostensibly military targets). Autonomous models could perform some of these tasks, parsing intelligence about the strike to provide insights to commanders and analysts. These insights, whether produced by man or machine, should then be fed into models at the “processing” and “analysis” stages of the cycle, creating a feedback loop. Absent this “on-the-job-training”, not only will a model never improve beyond its starting capability, with its biases and errors repeated ad infinitum, but it could potentially worsen as model drift increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there has been no indication that the IDF has been attempting to learn lessons from its strikes. It is fairly easy to verify deaths from specific strikes using reports from journalists in Gaza and the Ministry of Heath, not to mention the IDF’s continuous surveillance of the besieged territory. With the continued large-scale killing of innocents, one may be forgiven for assuming that either the IDF does not recognise these deaths as errors, or it is simply indifferent. The +972 Mag’s report even claims that damage assessments were abolished for junior militants. Although the rate of civilian deaths during the war has slowed relative to the first months of the war, this has been mainly as a result of international pressure, rather than humanitarian concern from the IDF. Any desire to review procedures only appears when the Israeli government faces a heavy backlash from its dwindling number of allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of AI in the targeting process is not inherently inhumane, but this depends entirely on how models are trained, tested and employed. In the case of the IDF, it seems clear that it has used systems not to refine targeting, but to expand and expedite its target cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If true, this would indicate, at best, a carelessness and recklessness from the IDF, placing speed of target generation above discrimination and the preservation of civilian life. At worst, such a target selection process constitutes a systematic devaluation of Palestinian lives, which could be reasonably considered collective punishment. Ultimately, while technology can change the speed or scale of military action, any accuracy or discrimination failures in the targeting cycle must be blamed solely on human choices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;警長稱人員用 Cellebrite 程式修復已刪除訊息 但並非「萬能」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/x6Zkion.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（3日）踏入第45日審訊。負責數碼法理鑑證的警長吳曉曦供稱，擷取人員曾用 Cellebrite 程式修復涉案電子裝置內的已刪除訊息，但功能並非「萬能」，且有機會未能修復訊息的建立或修改日期。而吳負責檢視相關資料，包括分析相片由涉案電話拍攝還是從其他途徑接收後儲存。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警長稱-cellebrite-程式能修復已刪除訊息&quot;&gt;警長稱 Cellebrite 程式能修復已刪除訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方傳召為修復程式 Cellebrite 專家的警長吳曉曦作供，他於2008年加入警隊，自2013年起隸屬網絡安全及科技罪案調查科的科技罪案組，負責數碼法理鑑證工作，包括檢驗手提電話及平板電腦等數碼流動裝置，以及硬碟或 USB 等儲存裝置。吳曾修畢 Cellebrite 課程，並指有關公司於1999年創立，為全球知名的法理鑑證公司。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳表示，本案警員獲得法院簽發的搜查令後，曾使用最新版本的 Cellebrite 檢驗在賴振邦及李家田被捕時檢獲的電話及平板電腦，修復 Telegram 等程式內的訊息，並於2024年3月22日撰寫報告。吳稱在擷取過程中，人員會令該電子裝置處於斷網狀態，以防被干擾。另外亦會將裝置保持充電，以免沒有電源導致過程中斷。吳解釋 Cellebrite 能夠呈現已被刪除的訊息，但有機會未能修復訊息的建立或修改日期。吳則負責事後檢驗，目的是分析相片是否由該電話拍攝，抑或由其他途徑接收並儲存在電話內。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警長表示離開群組後重回-可翻看早前訊息&quot;&gt;警長表示離開群組後重回 可翻看早前訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表賴振邦的大律師余承熹問到，一旦離開 Telegram 群組，是否可以翻看早前的訊息；吳表示據他個人理解是可以。被問到如何學習使用 Cellebrite，吳表示網罪組與警察學院合作提供相關課程。被問到擷取人員如何取決訊息是否與案有關；吳表示因案件而異，有時由對方自行決定，有時會與調查人員溝通，判斷哪些訊息與案有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（4日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方指彭卓棋被捕後推廣《基本法》、維護國安 官質疑屬投機&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mLy6Z1s.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（3日）續處理6名港島初選參與者的求情。代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀表示，彭基於對新法無知而犯案，他在《國安法》後已通知民主動力移除政綱，誤以為足以確保不違法；而彭具持續的愛國聯繫、熱心服務國家，曾推廣年輕人到大灣區創業，被捕後又受僱於「香港基本法基金會」，推廣《基本法》、維護國家安全，犯案是與其良好品格相違。惟法官拒納彭有撤回政綱，並質疑彭初選時以極端激進言辭反對政府和國家，被捕後改為到推廣基本法的組織工作，其行為不一致、只是另一投機之舉，彭或是「一個偽裝成愛國者的機會主義者」；法官又質疑，辯方求情明顯與法庭裁決、以及彭在初選的形象相違，明言難以接納。基本法基金會秘書長侯叔祺也有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第二批被告今完成求情，本周五（7月5日）將處理第三批被告求情，為6名九龍東初選參與者：黃之鋒、譚文豪、李嘉達、譚得志、胡志偉及施德來，料需時2天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選港島區初選的袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、鄭達鴻、徐子見、楊雪盈昨完成求情，法庭今處理彭卓棋的求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;昨已完成求情的鄭達鴻和徐子見兩人，今沒有到庭，其餘4人分成兩排就坐，向旁聽席微笑揮手。昨天紮髻的楊雪盈今束低馬尾，昨繫領帶的梁晃維今則無戴領帶，其餘各人裝束打扮與昨天大致一樣。佔中「大黃伯」、前立法會議員梁繼昌、前民陣召集人陳皓桓、社運人士曾健成等均有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指彭為機會主義者服務國家&quot;&gt;辯方指彭為「機會主義者」服務國家&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表彭的大律師盧敏儀表示，其立場與書面陳詞一致。法官陳仲衡引述辯方陳詞，提及彭卓棋是「機會主義者」，把握每個機會為國家服務，陳質疑法庭在判詞形容彭是「機會主義者」，意思非如辯方所指（“… that’s not what we mean”）。盧表示明白，但強調她對於所說的很認真（“I mean everything I said.”）。翻查判詞，法官指彭是是個投機取巧及不可信的證人，作出對自己有利的說法（“opportunistic and incredible witness who gave self-serving evidence”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方彭基於對新法無知犯案&quot;&gt;辯方：彭基於對新法無知犯案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀表示，彭是基於對法律的無知犯案，解釋《國安法》是新法例，在通過前沒有任何公眾諮詢和醞釀、也無時間讓公眾了解和調整其行為，不是普通的法例。法官陳慶偉指法例由全國人大通過，當然不是普通法例，但指其時為2019至2020年，本港幾乎不可能通過任何法例。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧續指，彭卓棋沒有案底，案發時僅約25至26歲，沒有政治聯繫，誤信當時所做的行為，包括通知民主動力移除政綱，已足以確保他沒有觸犯《國安法》。惟法官李運騰質疑，彭其後派發撕掉的政綱，又發布手持爛單張握拳的相片，姿勢像是抗議，法庭不接納彭有撤回他此前立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指彭已移除政綱-官質疑屬抗議拒納有撤回立場&quot;&gt;辯方指彭已移除政綱 官質疑屬抗議、拒納有撤回立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀補充，彭曾到初選票站確保政綱被移除，又從新聞得悉有愛國者稱初選不違法，錯誤以為其行為已足以表示他已退出「35+計劃」。惟法官陳慶偉表明不能接納這點，並指彭大可退出初選。盧同意那更理想，但指彭參選只是望服務人民，惟陳慶偉再指，彭並非如辯方所說的「天真」，提到區諾軒供稱與戴耀廷在初選前接觸彭時，彭關注投電子抑或實體票，可見彭一開始已對計劃感興趣，亦「完全知道他參與的是什麼」；而《國安法》後，他又發布撕掉選舉單張的相片作為抗議，其握拳姿勢是「對抗多於順從」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀指，彭是被攝影師要求做出該姿勢，法官陳慶偉指情況或許是那樣，「但誰是老闆？他是老闆！他應該告知攝影師他想呈現怎樣的形象！」盧續指，彭作為想參與初選「試水溫」的人，若發布這樣的相片猶如「政治自殺」，惟陳慶偉指當時正是要「鬥黃」。盧續指，彭在《國安法》改為發布實用資訊，他沒有出席任何組織者舉行的記者會，已做出明確行為顯示他誤以為所做的足夠避免犯法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指彭受僱基本法基金會續維護國安-官質疑屬投機&quot;&gt;辯方指彭受僱基本法基金會續維護國安 官質疑屬投機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀續指，彭的家人、太太和弟弟，以及香港基本法基金會秘書長侯叔祺今也有到庭支持。法官陳仲衡指，彭自2022年5月後受僱於基本法基金會，問辯方陳詞是否指他犯案後「悔過（repent）」，抑或他一直都是愛國者。盧一度同意前者，陳仲衡即追問那彭為何不認罪？盧其後指聽錯問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問，辯方能否澄清本輪求情陳詞，是顯示彭有悔意、顯示他有更生，還是什麼？又問他現時受僱情況與判刑有何關係。盧指，《國安法》目的是維護國家安全，如被告有進行維護國家安全的行為，應屬求情因素；又指彭被聘為「基本法學生中心」會長，基金會不會隨意聘請任何人，他們對彭有觀察。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，那是彭案發後的行為，如何協助說服法庭減刑；陳慶偉亦指，盧形容其當事人為「機會主義者」，這或是他另一次投機。法官陳仲衡補充指，是「一個偽裝成愛國者的機會主義者（an opportunist masquerading as a patriot）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方呈求情信-官質疑與裁決相違彭為人不一致&quot;&gt;辯方呈求情信 官質疑與裁決相違、彭為人不一致&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧指她不能同意，李運騰續指如辯方立場是彭已經改變，不大可能重犯，他可以理解，但除此以外不認為其受僱情況與判刑有關。盧續補充，彭參與基金會工作，更顯他的堅決和投入。惟李即指，彭卓棋先是推廣大灣區創業，至初選時用極端激進言辭反對政府甚至國家，被捕後卻再次改變，改為到推廣《基本法》的組織工作，「除了指他事實上就是一名機會主義者，我們如何能看出你當事人的行為是一致？」（“How can we see any consistency in the behaviour of your client, apart from saying that he is in fact an opportunist?”）法官陳仲衡亦指，對彭在選舉期間所說的話「記憶猶新（fresh in our mind）」，法庭已拒納他解釋自己僅在說「選舉語言」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧續指，彭曾創立「香港青年創業聯盟」，盡其所能協助年輕人到大灣區創業，可見他有良好品格；又引述多封求情信，來自已認識彭多年的朋友、老師、同事等，顯示他一直推廣大灣區創業，有社工亦指他為弱勢社群和年輕人轉介工作，其性格並非突然改變。惟李運騰再指，法庭已裁定彭有意圖顛覆國家政權，求情信呈現彭不同的形象、與裁決相違，質疑可給予多少比重；又指串謀歷時不短，即使辯方指彭一時誤入歧途，法庭也難以被說服。盧指她完全接納法庭裁決，求情信是顯示彭犯案與本性不符。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指彭具持續愛國聯繫-官明言難以接納&quot;&gt;辯方指彭具持續愛國聯繫 官明言難以接納&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續主動引述，盧在書面陳詞形容彭「有持續的愛國聯繫，具能力和熱情服務國家（continuous patriotic affiliation and his ability and enthusiasm to serve the state in Hong Kong）」，李運騰指似乎是描述一個與初選時完全不同的彭卓棋，與法庭所見完全不同。盧指，涉案言行已經作出，它們全部屬錯誤。李運騰即問：「如果他犯案與本性不符，那你最好告訴我們，他當時為何說出那些話、做出那些事？」盧敏儀回應指彭有「服務的抱負」，李運騰反問：「服務誰？服務他自己？」盧指是服務香港和國家，惟李再指：「很坦白地說，我們很難接受。」盧同意，但指「我不能扭曲我所理解的」，李再笑着反問：「你是在說我們扭曲證據嗎？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧重申，求情信反映彭的真實性格，望法庭考慮彭任區議員所參與的公共服務，及他推廣大灣區創業，被捕後又參與維護國家安全、推廣一國兩制和《基本法》而減刑。法官李運騰最後指，能看出盧非常盡力幫助被告，盧則重申，無論是書面或口頭陳詞的每個字都是真誠，望法庭考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，彭卓棋和梁晃維向旁聽席揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine has left much of the country in ruins. Rallying international support for the nation’s swift recovery has therefore become a necessity. From the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the international community has shown support for Ukraine and reaffirmed its commitments to help the country during the reconstruction process. Despite ongoing battles on the frontline and air raids, the rebuilding of affected areas started during spring 2022 and is ongoing. This Policy Brief examines whether virtual assets can be used to facilitate donations to Ukraine’s urgent reconstruction efforts and looks at how stakeholders can provide transparent information about how funds are used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual assets are already a feature of the war in Ukraine. From the start of the Russian invasion, the country has received aid in virtual assets from different parts of the world. On the second day of the invasion, Minister of the Digital Transformation of Ukraine Mykhailo Fedorov pushed for virtual asset donations and set up official governmental wallets to accept payments. This idea evolved into a project called Aid for Ukraine, which funded military and humanitarian aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The estimated cost of rebuilding Ukraine varies between $486 billion and $1.1 trillion. Historically, international governments have donated funds for reconstruction that filter through financial institutions and third parties to key stakeholders in the impacted country. However, foreign-government-funded projects, although a major support, can be delayed by authorisation and due diligence procedures. Many regions in Ukraine require immediate funds for urgent projects. To receive funds for urgent projects, a government platform, United24, allows virtual asset donations via Silent Donor. However, there is limited transparency on how money is allocated for specific reconstruction projects – there are only general mentions of potential projects, and no itemised list of needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A separate platform, Digital Restoration Ecosystem for Accountable Management (DREAM), developed in collaboration between Ukraine and international partners, provides an opportunity for international governments to support specific projects and see progress linked to allocated funds. However, there is no public information on how virtual assets donated to United24 transfer to reconstruction projects on the DREAM platform, or if a direct link between the platforms even exists. It is also not possible for individual members of the public to donate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Policy Brief outlines the steps that the Ukrainian government must take first to include virtual asset donations for specific reconstruction projects. These steps include ensuring a regulated environment, safeguards relating to cyber security, and additional layers of verification to confirm how funds are used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brief is informed by 12 semi-structured interviews with experts in the field of virtual assets and cyber security and representatives of government bodies. Interviews took place in January and February 2024. The qualitative data collected from interviews has been supplemented by a review of policy literature published between 2020 and March 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;virtual-assets-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Virtual Assets in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s desire to regulate the virtual asset industry dates back to at least 2020, before the full-scale invasion. In anti-money-laundering legislation, signed by President Zelensky in 2019, Ukraine defined a legal framework for anti-financial crime regulation of virtual assets. However, these specific features applying to virtual assets have not yet been put into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further attempt to bring the regulation of virtual assets in Ukraine in line with international standards was made in 2022, when Ukraine adopted and signed the Law on Virtual Assets No. 2074-IX. This law establishes a requirement to either amend or apply the Tax Code of Ukraine to account for virtual assets. However, it has not yet been decided whether to amend the tax code to encompass virtual assets or to accept cryptocurrency under the existing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full-scale invasion only strengthened Ukraine’s ambition to build a blockchain-friendly economy. As a result, two competing draft laws are currently in progress, both primarily aiming to address the tax issues in relation to virtual assets and thereby provide a basis for regulating the virtual asset market. Currently, both draft laws are undergoing review by the Taxation Committee of the Ukrainian parliament (Verkhovna Rada) and it remains unclear which one will be adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following table outlines the key differences between the two draft laws that include information on tax rates and the approach more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qGU5SxZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two draft laws have generated significant debate, especially in relation to the tax regimes proposed. One expert interviewed for this research argued that neither of the proposed laws and therefore amendments to Law on Virtual Assets No. 2074-IX are needed, as the current Tax Code of Ukraine should be flexible enough to incorporate virtual assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-even-consider-virtual-assets&quot;&gt;Why Even Consider Virtual Assets?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual assets present challenges that need to be considered prior to implementing a virtual asset donation option for reconstruction. For instance, the value of certain tokens can fluctuate rapidly, which can result in funds diminishing or increasing based on the market. Along with this, the virtual assets industry needs to overcome financial-crime-related challenges, such as the need to identify the source of donated funds. However, at the same time, interviewees for this research identified several benefits of regulating and safeguarding the industry in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of using virtual assets rather than fiat currency in reconstruction efforts will include speed, transparency, traceability and lower transaction costs. Notably, a challenge with disaster relief financial support is the lengthy and difficult process of sending funds via a cross-border transaction. Virtual assets, which are known for fast cross-border transactions when compared to fiat currency, can streamline the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is no international practice for blockchain technology for disaster relief or reconstruction, it is already used for humanitarian aid in Kenya and Ecuador. In Ukraine, virtual assets are used to make humanitarian payments to internally displaced people through a UNHCR project with the support of the Stellar Development Foundation. One expert interviewed detailed this process, noting that recipients are identified via Know Your Customer controls and can receive cash in return at MoneyGram locations in Ukraine. A similar model could be used for the reconstruction funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the potential benefits, there is not enough research on the best solution for the integration of virtual assets for disaster relief projects, as ongoing programmes are in pilot phases. More research must be done on best practices for directing virtual asset donations to support reconstruction. The next section outlines possible ways for Ukraine to expand financing opportunities for reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-conundrum-how-to-develop-a-virtual-asset-option&quot;&gt;The Conundrum: How to Develop a Virtual Asset Option&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts interviewed for this research were asked to consider two models for the use of donated virtual assets in the reconstruction process. The first involved the consolidation of donations by a centralised entity, donations that would then be converted to fiat currency before being used to pay the construction and other companies involved in a reconstruction project. The benefit of this model is that virtual assets would reduce the delay caused by cross-border fiat currency transactions. Once the money arrives in Ukraine, the country already has the financial infrastructure to support fast onward fiat transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second model involved a centralised entity consolidating donated funds, then distributing the virtual assets directly to construction companies. There was, however, a general view among interviewees that this model would not be practical for construction companies. In addition, virtual assets have limited usability for purchasing goods and services in Ukraine. Although some weapons companies have accepted virtual assets as payment in Ukraine, it is unlikely that reconstruction companies will have the capacity to use virtual assets to purchase machinery and raw materials or pay staff. In addition, if only some construction companies decided to accept virtual asset payments, these companies would inevitably monopolise the market. Therefore, there was broad agreement that any donations of virtual assets would need to be converted to fiat currency before being transferred to companies involved in reconstruction projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, some interviewees proposed the use of a blockchain protocol that offers smart contracts, that is, blockchain-based digital code that can support the execution of financial transactions. Notably, two experts identified that too much automation through smart contracts can result in a “death spiral”, leaving more room for error. Research has noted that security flaws in smart contracts can lead to exploitation. Therefore, if this option were integrated, great care would need to be taken to prevent illicit activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, an alternative option could be to develop a central bank digital currency (CBDC). In 2021, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) piloted the project e-hryvnia, a blockchain-based electronic form of the Ukrainian currency issued by the NBU. The NBU plans to conduct an open test of the state’s digital currency to understand its effectiveness and the feasibility of full-scale implementation. However, the CBDC would need to undergo extensive testing, which is why it would not be a practical option due to the immediacy of the need for reconstruction funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In view of this, consolidating donations through a centralised entity, then converting funds to fiat currency before paying construction companies appears to be the most practical option. The next section analyses this option in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-operationalise-the-model&quot;&gt;How to Operationalise the Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section provides an overview of the four steps that Ukraine should consider before establishing a virtual asset donation channel for reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-1-understand-regulation&quot;&gt;Step 1: Understand Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this model, which involves a virtual asset service provider (VASP) consolidating or exchanging virtual asset donations, stakeholders must have a clear understanding of the regulatory status of the company. With the current absence of an applied regulatory framework for virtual assets in Ukraine, the VASPs involved need to have controls in place to identify financial crime activities during the donation process. Without proper financial crime controls in place, international donors may lack confidence in the system, resulting in a shortfall in donations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complement the process, Ukraine should implement robust regulation for the virtual asset industry. As noted above, two bills to amend the tax code are currently under consideration, along with the third option of accepting it under the existing Tax Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is accountable for its implementation of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards on virtual assets. The FATF requires countries to meet specific standards regarding virtual assets, which include: understanding the risks posed; ensuring the registration and supervision of VASPs; and confirming that these entities have effective anti-money-laundering/counterterrorist-financing controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-2-consider-pre-existing-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Step 2: Consider Pre-existing Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has multiple avenues for enhancing the transparency of the reconstruction process, yet there is no one platform that includes an option for the general public to support specific projects through virtual asset donations and to see the progress of the project. The appropriate authorities could expand the platforms identified in the Introduction by building additional infrastructure to enable this possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research for this brief suggests that Ukraine should build a centralised environment for virtual asset donations for reconstruction using existing platforms. Multiple platforms accepting donations, with several options included, carries a risk of fraudulent platforms falsely claiming official status in order to request donations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine could expand one or more of the three existing government-run platforms. Aid for Ukraine is a product of collaboration between the Ministry of the Digital Transformation of Ukraine and virtual assets exchange Kuna. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, this public–private partnership was a crucial conduit for donations, with Kuna providing the infrastructure to receive donations and transmit funds on behalf of the government for war and humanitarian efforts. United24, a government-run platform built for accepting donations, is another option. Funds donated to United24, including virtual assets, are collected and transferred to official NBU accounts, and then assigned to the relevant ministries. Finally, the DREAM platform aims to create digital routes for the reconstruction projects. The platform allows local authorities to develop a project, upload the necessary documents, receive funds for the restoration, conduct procurement and thereafter monitor the construction. Each one of these platforms contains characteristics that, in combination, could result in a centralised and transparent reconstruction process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The addition of a VASP to one of these platforms could ensure the scalability and credibility of the process, as VASPs regularly invest in technological advancement around cyber security, anti-financial-crime measures and consumer protection. Rates of digital transformation in Ukraine are high, but there might still also be a need to engage foreign companies and their technical expertise. Within the context of this project, the partnering company must not have ties to Russia. Implementers of this project need to ensure that companies supporting Ukraine reconstruction efforts are not facilitating Russian interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-3-develop-strong-cyber-security-infrastructure-and-protocols&quot;&gt;Step 3: Develop Strong Cyber-Security Infrastructure and Protocols&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong cyber-security infrastructure and protocols are key to developing a platform for consolidating virtual asset donations. During the design process, it is important to anticipate attacks, identify potential risks and define use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To authorise virtual asset transactions, an encryption key known as a “private key” is used. This needs to be protected from cyber threats. Robust storage methods should be implemented for private keys to prevent illicit actors gaining unauthorised access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue to consider is who has access to the private key(s) linked to donations. To reduce corruption or bribery risk, no individual should have sole access to private key(s) linked to donations, as this would represent a single point of failure. For example, a corrupt individual with sole access to the private key could authorise a transaction to send funds to another virtual asset address under their control. Or, if a private key held by an individual was compromised by another entity without the knowledge of the holder, the illicit actor could authorise a transaction – in other words, steal the funds. Therefore, strict processes must be in place to determine which stakeholders have control over private key(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, if a VASP takes responsibility for consolidating donations, and authorities responsible for donations have an account at the exchange, there could be consequences if the exchange is hacked. A credible virtual asset company with robust cyber-security practices would be essential, as government bodies may not have the resources and expertise to develop a scalable process for receiving and exchanging virtual asset donations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a stakeholder has sole access to the private key(s), there should not be only one method of unilateral control. Two options should be considered for secure storage of donations. One option would be the use of multi-signature wallets, that is, the requirement of multiple authorities to “approve” transactions before execution. However, this approach to storage could potentially result in cyber-security risks if not properly implemented. To mitigate this risk, a second option could be multi-party computation, which involves designated authorities receiving shares or pieces of essentially a single private key, along with the use of third-party authentication applications for verification. The pros and cons of each option must be thoroughly understood to identify the right approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the involvement of government bodies, it is critical to ensure that cyber-security teams are integrated with other agencies, including law enforcement, and synchronise their efforts. Anyone who has access to a share of the private key(s) should be trained in and understand cyber-security threats. Cyber-security teams should monitor new crime methodologies for cyber threats on online forums such as Telegram. Ensuring the monitoring of new cybercrime methods is crucial, as there are many examples of Russian actors targeting Ukrainian infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-4-test-the-system-before-launch&quot;&gt;Step 4: Test the System Before Launch&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the full-scale public launch of a virtual asset donation option, Ukraine should conduct a test of the system in a secure environment. The pilot of the platform should scale up slowly to identify potential failure points and ways to mitigate vulnerabilities. Using an isolated environment to test the platform would help to identify risks and the appropriate regulatory treatment of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with technical testing, authorities should use a regulatory sandbox to determine how the product fluctuates more broadly before the official launch. Currently, the Ministry of Digital Transformation in Ukraine is working to develop such a sandbox. The aim of the sandbox is to create an effective system of communication between businesses, regulators, law enforcement and supervisors. If it is ready in time, Ukraine can use it to test a prototype for donating virtual assets to urgent reconstruction projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A project will not be perfect for the first testing procedure. Therefore, there should be several rounds of testing before the product’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-virtual-assets-wont-solve-the-entire-problem-&quot;&gt;But Virtual Assets Won’t Solve the Entire Problem …&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the concept above involves consolidating donations in virtual assets, then converting funds to fiat currency, there is another side to the transparency problem. There needs to be enhanced transparency on sending fiat payments to construction companies and how the projects progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be important to verify construction companies receiving funds. Some companies might commit fraud by obtaining funds allocated for the reconstruction process without intending to carry out a project. As with any large construction project, there is a risk of bribery and corruption; robust identification of beneficial ownership of construction companies can help to reduce this risk. Ukraine has already progressed towards this step by passing a new law on ultimate beneficial ownership in September 2022, improving the process of registration and verification of beneficial ownership information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the process should incorporate regular audits of construction projects. Some platforms rely on public access to information to assess construction progress. However, it may be possible for companies to use technology such as generative AI to fake progress. To mitigate this, an in-person audit may be beneficial. The risk of corruption and fraud cannot be reduced to zero, but a robust audit process can limit the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian authorities responsible for reconstruction need to ensure that capacity and resources are available to keep track of projects. In a vulnerable environment, authorities need to understand the scope of risks before funding reconstruction projects on a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine already accepts virtual asset donations for war and humanitarian efforts, therefore developing a robust virtual asset framework is becoming increasingly important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukraine maintains reconstruction efforts, fundraising opportunities not only should include a virtual asset donation option to allow the general public to donate directly to urgent projects, but must also provide transparent updates on progress. Since Ukraine has available expertise and platforms, a centralised environment with a virtual asset donation option should be developed. However, to achieve this goal, responsible authorities must first implement robust virtual asset regulation, expand pre-existing infrastructure, develop cyber-security safeguards, and test the system before launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual assets will not solve the entire problem of limited transparency. Therefore, authorities should consider options to ensure the verification of construction companies that receive reconstruction funds, and undertake audits to determine progress on projects. Taking these steps can streamline and maximise the use of virtual assets for a transparent reconstruction process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent months, unsettling rhetoric from senior Iranian individuals over the country’s nuclear programme – alongside continued Iranian advancements in this area and escalating tensions in the Middle East – has highlighted the urgency of finding a resolution to the now decades-old Iranian nuclear question. The options available to the US and its partners for inducing a roll-back of Iran’s programme are limited, given that economic threats and incentives, as well as security assurances, will be difficult to make meaningful and credible. However, Iran still appears to perceive some benefit from maintaining a threshold nuclear programme rather than developing a nuclear weapons capability. The US and its partners should leverage remaining carrots and sticks to reinforce this assumption, making clear to Tehran that it would be worse off with a nuclear weapons capability than its current threshold nuclear status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limited-incentives-and-assurances&quot;&gt;Limited Incentives and Assurances&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it stands, US intelligence does not believe that Iran is conducting weaponisation-related research. However, the country possesses a highly advanced – and advancing – nuclear programme. The escalation in regional violence in the Middle East – including direct Iranian and Israeli strikes on each other’s territories – appears to have increased Iranian reliance on the advanced programme as a source of deterrence. In recent months, a number of senior Iranian individuals have alluded to the country’s technical and political ability to reconsider its stated policy of not pursuing nuclear weapons, should the need arise. Meanwhile, according to a recent poll, the Iranian public appears to be increasingly in favour of developing a nuclear weapons capability. Masoud Pezeshkian – the reformist candidate who secured the greatest number of votes in the first round of Iran’s presidential elections – has signalled a willingness to return to nuclear diplomacy. This is a positive sign; however, it is unclear how Pezeshkian’s intentions will align with the priorities of the Supreme Leader, who ultimately sets the direction of Iran’s foreign and security policy. Should hardliner candidate Saeed Jalili be elected to the presidency, a more conciliatory stance on the nuclear question would be unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is increasingly a dearth of credible incentives and assurances that the US and its partners can offer Iran. One often-mentioned source of leverage is the option of “snapping back” UN Security Council (UNSC) sanctions on Iran which had been lifted in 2016 under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). If not snapped back, the suspended sanctions resolutions will expire in October 2025, removing the option of reimposing them and closing the Iran nuclear file at the UNSC. The prospect of passing new sanctions is highly unlikely considering the current politics of the UNSC. Snapback would reintroduce a range of international prohibitions and other restrictions on Iranian economic activity, including an expectation for member states to stop and inspect Iranian vessels suspected of sanctions violations and to “exercise vigilance” when dealing with Iranian banks. Critically, it seems that snapback would likely result in the reimposition of targeted financial sanctions (TFS) on individual entities. Presumably, this would once again grant the Financial Action Task Force (the global financial crime compliance watchdog) a mandate to evaluate and report on member state compliance with said TFS, which it lost in October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While Tehran may have in the past felt that it could use its nuclear programme to secure concessions from the West, it has probably lost much of its value as a meaningful source of leverage for Iran&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, UNSC sanctions have lost much of their teeth in light of the increased politicisation of the UNSC and the expansion of Iran’s economic and military relationship with Russia. Furthermore, the expansive scope of US unilateral sanctions on Iran significantly limits the practical impact of UNSC sanctions reimposition, as many financial institutions globally already refuse to do business with Iran so as not to run afoul of US regulations. Any promises of US sanctions relief will also be challenging to make credible, regardless of who ends up in the White House following the election later this year. As became clear during efforts to revive the JCPOA in the first two years of the Biden presidency, the extent and complexity of US sanctions on Iran, as well as the massive political divide in Washington over how best to deal with Iran, mean that sanctions relief will be difficult to deliver even if Donald Trump does not return to the presidency. There is equally no guarantee that any diplomatic or economic promises would survive the 2028 presidential election. Europe’s impotence in offering Iran economic benefits after the reimposition of US sanctions in 2018 also undermines the credibility of any European offers of economic engagement with Iran. The negative normative implications of being a UNSC-sanctioned country are also likely to be of decreasing relevance to Iran as the practical economic impacts wane and as Iran continues to expand its political, economic and security relationships with Russia and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, while Tehran may have in the past felt that it could use its nuclear programme to secure concessions from the US, Europe and others, the programme has probably lost much of its value as a meaningful source of economic and diplomatic leverage for Iran. The primary value for Iran of an advanced nuclear programme now likely rests in a perception of its ability to deter – or secure assurances against – direct threats to Iranian security, namely the targeting of Iranian assets abroad, military attacks on Iranian territory, and regime change. Arguably, the programme has been unsuccessful in deterring against the first and – in part – the second. Israel has continued to target Iranian assets abroad and carried out a strike – albeit a limited one – on Iranian territory in April. However, Iran may still perceive some value in the programme’s ability to deter large-scale attacks on its territory or efforts at regime change. Incentivising Iran to roll back its nuclear programme would therefore require decreasing Iran’s reliance on its nuclear threshold status as a source of security. Tehran would need to be convinced that it would not become vulnerable to military strikes against its territory or forced regime change should it agree to nuclear concessions. Here, too, making credible commitments will prove challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has in the past publicly stated that it is not pursuing regime change in Iran, and has reportedly privately communicated that message to Tehran more recently. The high political costs and escalatory risks of a US decision to carry out military strikes against Iranian territory – or even (perhaps to a lesser degree) US support to Israel or others for carrying out such strikes – should also provide Iran with some reassurance that it is highly unlikely that the US would pursue such a course of action. However, it is unclear to what extent the government in Tehran believes that the US would not accept these risks at some point in the future, particularly if Iran were to give up or significantly roll back parts of its nuclear programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critically, the US cannot provide Tehran with credible assurances that Israel would not strike Iran. Washington can privately urge Israel against such attacks or refuse to materially support them (which may operationally undermine Israel’s ability to carry out certain types of attacks), but this may not be sufficient to forestall an Israeli decision to strike. Any commitments made in private could be easily denied and reneged on; meanwhile, public Israeli commitments not to strike Iran are politically unfeasible. The recent escalation in Iran’s nuclear rhetoric suggests that Tehran is not entirely convinced of US or Israeli restraint and still feels the need to flex its threshold nuclear status, presumably as an insurance policy against any such attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;remaining-carrots-and-sticks&quot;&gt;Remaining Carrots and Sticks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, weaponisation of the Iranian nuclear programme is not inevitable. The earlier-mentioned rhetoric from senior Iranian figures suggests that Tehran perceives its current threshold status as a sufficient guarantor of security. The relatively modest Iranian response to the recent Board of Governors resolution calling out Iranian unwillingness to cooperate with the IAEA also suggests that Tehran is for the time being unwilling – or does not see the need – to push the nuclear envelope much further than it already has. Recent reports of indirect diplomacy between Iran and the US through Oman, which seems to have succeeded in limiting progress on at least some parts of the Iranian nuclear programme, are also promising. There is, of course, no guarantee that this will hold perpetually. Should Iran feel that its threshold nuclear status is insufficient to guarantee its security – for instance, following further attacks on its territory or a further degradation of its regional assets and proxies – it could still decide to pursue a nuclear deterrent. A number of carrots and sticks remain available to the US and its partners to reinforce the message that Tehran stands more to lose than to gain from a decision to acquire nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the limited practical economic implications of reimposed UNSC sanctions, it is still worth threatening the possibility of snapback while it is still available; however, this should not be the sole point of leverage. The threat may produce little result, or it could convince Iran to make some limited concessions – perhaps increasing IAEA access to its nuclear programme or freezing enrichment levels. At the same time, 15 months is not a long time to resolve the myriad issues that would need to be addressed to justify the closing of the Iran nuclear file at the UNSC; Iran may just run down the clock by making perfunctory concessions that could be reversed after October 2025. Meanwhile, actually acting on the threat to reimpose sanctions would run a high risk of Iranian escalation – including a potential withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which could make monitoring and preventing weaponisation harder. This catch-22 situation points to the ultimately limited relevance of snapback for meaningfully dealing with the Iranian nuclear question. Alternative options for incentivising and deterring Iran are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The recent escalation in Iran’s nuclear rhetoric suggests that Tehran is not entirely convinced of US or Israeli restraint and still feels the need to flex its threshold nuclear status&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diplomatic and economic pressure from countries still friendly towards Iran may prove helpful. The acquisition of a nuclear weapon would likely lead to political and economic ostracisation by countries like China, India, South Africa and others that may tolerate a threshold Iranian nuclear capability but not a nuclear-armed Iran. Pre-emptively encouraging these countries to place additional pressure on Tehran to forego weaponisation – particularly in ways that threaten key diplomatic and economic lifelines for Iran – may help influence Iranian decision-making. However, the extent of influence that these countries would have in Tehran, and whether they would be willing to expend any political capital to prevent weaponisation, is debatable. Should the decision be made to snap back UNSC sanctions, this may grant the necessary political cover to increase economic and diplomatic pressure on Tehran for countries that wish to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining diplomatic channels between the US and Iran – even indirect ones like the Omani channel mentioned above – will remain important for making it clear to Tehran that a diplomatic resolution remains possible. At the same time, sensitively communicated threats of military escalation by the US should not be ruled out. Making any such threats credible will be challenging, however. The advanced and hardened state of Iran’s nuclear programme will make it impossible to permanently eliminate the possibility of it being reconstituted in the future. Meanwhile, risks of escalation in regional violence and political pushback even from allies would be very high. Washington may in the end decide that the gamble is not worth the uncertain prize. However, the escalatory risks should also mean that strikes would not be considered short of the most extreme of circumstances – namely, an Iranian decision to weaponise. Drawing red lines in this instance would also be challenging, as defining and detecting a decision to weaponise will be difficult. However, this ambiguity could be helpful in discouraging Iran from trying to test how much it can get away with. Any military threats must be made discreetly, denying Iran the opportunity to point to such threats as a reason for future escalation of its nuclear programme. Such discretion will also allow Tehran to save face by avoiding the perception that it is making concessions to Washington, while equally permitting the US to retain flexibility in deciding whether and when Iran has crossed a red line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed solutions are imperfect – none guarantee success, none will be straightforward to implement and some – particularly threats of UNSC sanctions snapback or of military attack – pose the risk of backfiring. The US and its partners will need to weigh these and other policy options against assessments of how likely Iran is to be moving towards a decision to weaponise its programme, and how much convincing is needed to keep it from doing so. Hard decisions may have to be made on whether certain risks may ultimately be necessary and worth taking to avoid the potential emergence of a nuclear-armed Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（2日）踏入第44日審訊。控方傳召負責分析電子及電路訊號的時任高級督察盧永楷，他檢驗了警方在華仁書院檢獲的炸彈引爆裝置。盧解釋小炸彈引爆裝置結構包括手提電話、電池、計電器裝置及電子火柴。當有人致電裝置內的手提電話，電話就會發出震動訊號，並啟動計電器裝置，導致電子火柴著火。至於大炸彈裝置的原理亦大同小異，但由金屬圈代替電子火柴。惟盧稱設計出現問題，未必會著火。盧承認不知道引爆器是否能正常運作，亦同意大炸彈有可能不會爆炸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;政府化驗師稱華仁書院所檢獲的為高性能炸藥&quot;&gt;政府化驗師稱華仁書院所檢獲的為高性能炸藥&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;政府法證化驗師陳凱耀博士供稱，他負責檢驗在華仁書院橋底下檢獲的炸藥物體，並撰寫專家報告。陳在樣本中發現有硝酸銨、燃油及木屑的混合物，組合後成為高性能炸藥 ANFO；另一樣本則為「六亞甲基三過氧化二胺」（HMTD）化學品。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方展示電話內容提及如何製作黑火藥&quot;&gt;控方展示電話內容提及如何製作黑火藥&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，控方展示從黃振強電話內擷取、由吳智鴻傳送化學品製作流程的訊息。陳表示內容關於如何製作、處理或存放一種高爆炸性炸藥，即 TATP。另一電話內亦有備忘錄，內容關於不同化學品，包括用硫磺、木炭及氧化劑可製成低性能炸藥「黑火藥」（gunpowder），同時可用其他化學品製成可釋放強光及熱力的「鋁熱劑」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;化驗師同意部分材料可在藥房購買&quot;&gt;化驗師同意部分材料可在藥房購買&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，備忘錄提到的氧化劑可以在藥房購買，其目的用作醫治香港腳。陳解釋，若氧化劑混合甘油，等待一段時間就會自行燃燒。至於備忘錄提及的酸性液體，實際是通渠水。而碳酸鈉則屬於蘇打粉的一種，市面上可容易購買。陳同意控方指，上述是大學化學系常用的化學品。控方及後展示上網搜尋「炸藥發展史 其實黑火藥沒啥威力的」之紀錄，陳表示「黑火藥」是人類久遠歷史一直使用的炸藥。在辯方盤問下，陳同意這些資訊可以在網站上搜尋到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;電子專家同意大炸彈設計有問題-可能不會爆炸&quot;&gt;電子專家同意大炸彈設計有問題 可能不會爆炸&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另傳召負責分析電子及電路訊號的時任高級督察盧永楷，他檢驗了警方在華仁書院檢獲的炸彈引爆裝置，並撰寫專家報告。盧首先解釋小炸彈引爆裝置的結構，他指當中包括一部手提電話、電池、計電器裝置及電子火柴。計電器裝置目的是作為開關用途，當有人致電裝置內的手提電話，電話就會發出震動訊號，並啟動計電器裝置，最後導致電子火柴著火。至於大炸彈引爆裝置的原理亦大同小異，但當中沒有電子火柴，而是由金屬圈連接螺絲，當金屬圈接收電流就會形式閉環，導致電池及電線發熱，未必會著火。惟盧稱設計出現問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧曾表示，一般需要移除電話內的震動馬達才可製成引爆器。但在代表張銘裕的大律師姚本成盤問下，盧承認不知道本案中的震動馬達是否有被移除，因此不知道引爆器是否能正常運作，還是僅為模擬裝置。另外，代表李家田的大律師林芷瑩問到，炸彈是否可能不會爆炸；盧同意有可能，若致電該手提電話後「收線」，裝置隨即會關掉且停止發熱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（3日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今日（2日）開始處理第二批被告、6名港島初選參與者的求情，包括認罪的袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、徐子見，及受審後罪成的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈及彭卓棋，預計需時2天。不少被告的朋友到庭旁聽，其中梁晃維中學班主任讚揚梁秉承中學校訓「修己善群」，「無論認唔認罪都好，歷史都會判佢無罪」；楊雪盈友人指楊是十分願意協助的區議員，望傳承她的精神；徐子見友人讚揚他是「好有心嘅議員」，望讓他知道「我哋仲存在」，「我哋仲 support 緊佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 《獨媒》記者今早約6時到達西九龍裁判法院，法庭門外已有逾50名市民排隊等候，當中有約40名市民戴帽、口罩和耳機等，部分背對行人路和低頭而坐，記者上前問何時到達、旁聽什麼案件均沒有回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;排頭位的是法庭旁聽常客「姨婆」，她與姨甥孫於昨晚10時30分已到達法院門外。早前涉「小彤群抽會」煽動案被捕的李盈姿昨晚現身銅鑼灣，今早則約清晨4時到達西九龍法院外，她向記者指今日6名求情被告都相當年青，認為各被告均無做錯，並稱：「香港人仲係撐佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;梁晃維中學班主任梁秉承中學校訓修己善群&quot;&gt;梁晃維中學班主任：梁秉承中學校訓「修己善群」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;現年約50歲的前教師林先生，在清晨約3時已經到達法院外位置。林先生稱過去多年一直有留意社運發展，「去到呢個時刻都會撐佢哋。」他續向記者指，梁晃維就讀伊利沙伯中學時，自己曾任其班主任，笑言：「最初佢好純㗎，後來無諗到佢咁勇」，他大讚梁讀書時期成績優異，秉承伊利沙伯中學「修己善群」校訓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;多名被告還柙超過三年「未判先審」，林先生不時都會到荔枝角收押所探望對方，他指梁晃維現時精神狀態不錯。他最後再道，梁由被補到審訊，已達成其自己的目標，「無論認唔認罪都好，歷史都會判佢無罪。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊雪盈友人會傳承佢嘅精神&quot;&gt;楊雪盈友人：會傳承佢嘅精神&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G小姐（化名）向《獨媒》表示，為了支持被告之一楊雪盈，今早約7時到達法院排隊。G小姐稱，自己於2017年一次遊行中認識楊雪盈，稱當時有社區規劃上問題，並指「好多人接觸過自己社區嘅區議員，都係完全問唔到」。正當無從入手之際，便「膽粗粗」向楊詢問意見，而楊亦願意和十分落力協助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eACTcMZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G小姐續指，每逢旁聽該案時都會穿着綠色衫，今日亦特意身穿綠色連身長裙，「因為佢（楊雪盈）話如果支持佢就着綠色衫啦。」楊雪盈還柙逾一個月，她就對楊身體狀況表示憂慮，擔心其身體會逐漸瘦弱，「好擔心佢愈來愈瘦，因為佢本身都好瘦㗎喇。」被問到有什麼說話向楊雪盈說，她就稱：「我會繼續喺我嘅崗位努力，傳承佢嘅精神。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;徐子見友人我哋仲存在&quot;&gt;徐子見友人：我哋仲存在&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前東區區議員徐子見的朋友蘋果（化名），今特意乘頭班車前來旁聽，約7時許到達。她表示於2014年雨傘運動期間認識徐子見，認為徐是「好落力、好畀心機做好區務嘅一個區議員」，即使其他區的市民找他幫忙，也會落手落腳努力做好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蘋果坦言，對徐子見因參選而被捕有點可惜，但認為以現在時勢，即使他當時無參加初選，「都做唔到啲乜嘢」，故不會太過感慨，因「始終係佢嘅選擇」。徐子見選擇認罪，首提堂起還柙至今逾3年4個月，蘋果說有不時探望徐，形容他精神和身體狀態也不錯，今天到場是希望「show 吓我嘅存在畀佢睇，我哋仲 support 緊佢」、「我哋仲存在」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;某被告藝術班學生到場支持-稱其開朗正面&quot;&gt;某被告藝術班學生到場支持 稱其開朗正面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中一名被告的藝術班學生阿輝，今早6時半到法庭外排隊，他稱讚該名被告為人正面、開朗，不時鼓勵學生。阿輝續向《獨媒》表示，今日希望到場支持47人，他對案件橫跨數年感到無奈，多名被告還柙已久仍未有判決，故今日希望到場旁聽，令被告知道仍然有人支持自己，「其實都無了期咁樣好似咁，又冇咩可以做到，唯一可以做到就係精神上支持佢哋，嚟到都希望畀佢見到我哋，咁佢都知道我哋仍然支持佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，共45人罪成，今（2日）開始處理第二批被告、6名港島初選參與者的求情，包括認罪的袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、徐子見，及受審後罪成的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈及彭卓棋，預計需時2天。代表袁嘉蔚的資深大律師祁志先進行求情，他認為顛覆罪的刑期分級制不適用於本案，而涉案謀劃「天真」、「註定失敗」，法庭不應基於猜測的嚴重後果、而應按被告實際參與判刑，而袁在報名參選後已被DQ，謀劃對國安造成很少甚至沒有危害。祁志又形容，袁是有理想的年輕女子，一生為人善良，對社會有抱負，並透露袁嘉蔚最近在獄中與另一人結婚，望及早服刑完畢，開始組織家庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被告精神不俗-由6懲教看守&quot;&gt;被告精神不俗 由6懲教看守&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪、周天行、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋。袁嘉蔚由資深大律師祁志代表，梁晃維由資深大律師彭耀鴻代表，鄭達鴻由資深大律師潘熙、大律師黃宇逸代表，徐子見由大律師黃雅斌代表，楊雪盈由大律師張耀良代表，彭卓棋由大律師盧敏儀代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;各被告於約10時步入法庭，此前獲保釋、罪成後須還柙的3人，鄭達鴻身穿深灰色西裝，較裁決日略為消瘦，精神不俗，微笑向律師和旁聽席揮手。啡色頭髮的楊雪盈紮髻，穿淺綠色背心連身裙、米白色通花外套，向旁聽席飛吻和微笑。在裁決日剷了光頭的彭卓棋，頭髮長了少許，身穿白色上衣、深藍色西裝外套，拉下口罩與旁聽席說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於已還柙至今逾3年4個月的另外3人，梁晃維戴黑框眼鏡，穿灰色西裝外套、繫黑白斜紋間條領帶。頭髮灰白的徐子見戴口罩，穿白色長袖裇衫，向旁聽席揮手，不時摸頭髮，又做OK手勢。袁嘉蔚則戴黑框眼鏡、穿黑色連身裙，束劉海和綁馬尾，早休後披上淺啡色外套。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;與戴耀廷5人求情時由約10名懲教人員分隔、各被告分坐在被告欄不同位置不同，今只有6名懲教在被告欄內，男女被告分成上下兩排就坐，梁晃維、鄭達鴻和彭卓棋之間更沒有懲教相隔。前立法會議員邵家臻、前東區區議員韋少力、大律師吳靄儀等都有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;罪成被告則分成兩個延伸庭觀看直播，二號法庭為吳敏兒、黃碧雲、余慧明和黃子悅4人，一號法庭為黃之鋒、劉頴匡、譚凱邦、馮達浚、施德來、伍健偉、吳政亨7人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方若考慮刑期分級制判刑為走後門&quot;&gt;辯方：若考慮刑期分級制判刑為「走後門」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表袁嘉蔚的資深大律師祁志先陳詞。與戴耀廷一方一樣，祁志認為本案是以串謀罪、而非國安法控罪定罪，認為顛覆罪的刑期分級制並不適用，法庭判刑時應以普通法原則，根據《刑事罪行條例》第159C條，按被告參與程度、罪行嚴重性判刑。法官陳仲衡和李運騰提及，即使分級制不適用，也可用作參考，惟祁志指，若判刑時考慮不適用的成文法例是「走後門」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方謀劃註定失敗-法庭不應基於猜測後果判刑&quot;&gt;辯方：謀劃註定失敗 法庭不應基於猜測後果判刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志續指，涉案謀劃本質上有缺陷（essentially flawed）、註定失敗（doomed to fail），政府或會DQ被告，而被告能否否決預算案，取決於立法會選舉結果，被告除地區直選外，亦須在功能組別取得大多數。即使他們成功否決預算案，選民會否再次投選同一人、被告會否履行承諾，均屬未知數（uncertainty）。祁志認為，法庭不應基於猜測（speculation）、假設性和不能證明會發生的嚴重後果判刑，而只應基於被告實際參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iRtb9qT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
▲ 袁嘉蔚（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉一度指，但戴耀廷不是這樣想，他相信他的計劃會成功。惟祁志反問，「戴耀廷被證明錯過多少次？」，重申法庭不能肯定謀劃會成功，若法庭以戴耀廷的想法、而非袁嘉蔚的參與及真誠相信謀劃是合法來判刑，那不可能是正確。祁志又引馬俊文和呂世瑜案，指判刑時須考慮實際後果、潛在風險和影響，惟政府最終延後選舉，本案謀劃沒有發生，只有很少實際的破壞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志又指，本案涉及以合法手段否決預算案，被告行為在《國安法》前屬合法，法庭判刑時不應考慮；而在《國安法》後，袁嘉蔚報名參選後也被DQ，涉案串謀短暫，只歷時29日，對國家安全只有很少甚至沒有危害。法官李運騰指，但被告有想好DQ的應對計劃，祁志則形容，計劃「天真」，強調本案並非「令人髮指（heinous）」的罪行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方本案行為屬顛覆罪最輕微&quot;&gt;辯方：本案行為屬顛覆罪最輕微&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志續引《國安法》第22條，指顛覆罪下列明4項顛覆行為，除本案所涉的「嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞香港特別行政區政權機關依法履行職能」，還包括推翻和破壞中國憲法所確立的中國根本制度、推翻中央或香港特區政權機關，以及攻擊、破壞特區政權機關履職場所及設施，致使其無法正常履行職能。祁志認為，相較之下，本案所涉行為是4種行為之中罪責最輕微，因不涉中國根本制度及實際攻擊致政權機關「無法正常履行職能」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就袁嘉蔚的罪責，祁志指袁的參與程度較低，她曾參加選舉論壇，望參選取得合法權力，但其後已被DQ，沒有重犯機會。祁志又指，《國安法》目的在防範和制止危害國安罪行，而本案法律程序已帶出阻嚇訊息，本港已感受到《國安法》的影響；考慮到袁已還柙3年半，法庭判刑時可寬大處理、施以仁慈，給予被告個人背景求情因素更多比重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方袁一生為人善良對社會有抱負&quot;&gt;辯方：袁一生為人善良、對社會有抱負&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就袁的個人背景，祁志形容袁是一名有理想的年輕女子（idealistic young woman），正如本案不少被告出身中產或勞工階層，並努力令自己變得更好，他們是「我們的同事，我們的孩子，我們的大人，我們的人民」，並非一般罪犯，他們相信其行為是合法。祁志續指，袁畢業於城大，主修中文及歷史，其後到南區的田灣做社區工作和任區議員，她一生一直都是善良的人，樂於助人，在獄中更因善良而惹上麻煩，而她對社會的抱負和善良的「回報」，卻可能是4至5年刑期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方披露袁最近獄中與另一人結婚&quot;&gt;辯方披露袁最近獄中與另一人結婚&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志續提到，袁的人生因為被還柙而被改寫，如今「正在更生（rehabilitation）的路上」，若再判更重的刑期會毀掉她的更生進度。祁志又指，袁最近在獄中與另一人結婚，袁不希望在庭上披露男方的身份，但二人希望及早服刑完畢，開始組織家庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/20bICcX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，共45人罪成，今（2日）開始處理第二批被告、6名港島初選參與者的求情，包括認罪的袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、徐子見，及受審後罪成的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈及彭卓棋。代表梁晃維的資深大律師彭耀鴻指，梁屬「積極參加者」且參與有限，他犯案是出於好意，望以合法手段令特首回應民意。辯方庭上讀出梁晃維親撰的求情信節錄，梁提及生於九七一代如「被詛咒的孩子」，每個人生新階段都會遇上香港的重大事件，如沙士、雨傘運動、反修例運動和疫情，深感與香港同悲同喜、命運緊緊相連。梁又指，香港自2019年面對困境，許多人感到迷失，「但我從來沒有對香港或香港人失去信心」，憑着對這片土地的熱愛，及前人承傳下來的精神，他相信香港定能繼續逆風而行，且「只要我還活着，締造更美好的香港永遠都會是我的終生抱負」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方墨落於國安法前發起-僅重申已達成共識&quot;&gt;辯方：「墨落」於國安法前發起 僅重申已達成共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;袁嘉蔚一方今早完成求情後，由梁晃維及鄭達鴻一方陳詞。代表梁晃維的資深大律師彭耀鴻表示，梁晃維是「墨落無悔」聲明書發起人之一，但聲明於《國安法》生效前發布，只是重申已達成的共識，法庭不應考慮。法官陳慶偉指，聲明雖於《國安法》生效前發起，但其後沒有撤回。彭同意，但指那沒有加重太多梁的參與。陳慶偉又向彭確認，梁曾出席抗爭派記者會，指會將此納入考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HXRIZyT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
▲ 左起：袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、鄭達鴻（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方梁晃維為積極參加者-但國安法後參與有限&quot;&gt;辯方：梁晃維為「積極參加者」 但國安法後參與有限&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭續指，梁晃維被DQ後，沒有再找 Plan B，亦表明不會這樣做。法官陳慶偉問有何證據，法官陳仲衡則指，梁曾解釋不找 Plan B 的原因，是因難以找到有共同政治理念又沒有觸及「紅線」的候選人，指不是他不想，而是他找不到 Plan B。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭續指，梁並非「首要分子」，他沒有組織或計劃涉案謀劃，只是參與者。辯方同意梁是「積極參加者」（量刑為3至10年），但強調他在《國安法》後的行為非常有限，只曾出席競選街站、出席抗爭派記者會等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指梁晃維誤信計劃合法-官質疑&quot;&gt;辯方指梁晃維誤信計劃合法 官質疑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭耀鴻續強調，梁晃維並非蓄意不尊重法律。法官陳慶偉打斷指，但梁晃維認為戴耀廷太過溫和，因此才發起「墨落無悔」；又質疑梁並非因對法律無知而犯案，梁與袁嘉蔚的情況有點不同，梁比袁做得更多。法官李運騰則舉例，有部分候選人或對法律無知，真誠相信戴耀廷稱計劃合法；但有其他候選人或是頑固的激進或極端分子（diehard radicals or extremists），無論《國安法》有否落實也會繼續，並公然違抗法律。李指針對後者，對法律無知並非求情因素。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 袁嘉蔚（左）、梁晃維（右）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭同意，但引述梁晃維曾稱，「無論我哋係對政府嘅提案定財政預算案投下反對票，呢個都係我哋作為代議士一個合法嘅權利，唔代表佢係一個非法嘅初選」，指梁當時相信否決是合法。惟法官陳慶偉搖頭，指辯方說法須有更多證據支持。彭重申，梁當時相信所做的是正確，望法庭定下量刑起點時考慮本案嚴重性，即謀劃原本設計是使用合法手段，非公然違法，及被告對法律無知；其後再考慮梁及時認罪，給予三分一扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方梁具良好動機-望以合法手段令特首更聽民意&quot;&gt;辯方：梁具良好動機 望以合法手段令特首更聽民意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於梁晃維的個人背景，彭耀鴻指，梁不僅沒有案底，而且根據其家人、相識的人所撰的求情，他是一個有愛心的年輕人，會照顧流浪動物，而從他在大學學生會、區議員等參與，可見他真誠承諾服務社區。彭又指，本案顛覆非常獨特，被告犯案非為個人私利，而是出於良好動機，尋求以他們認為合法的手段帶來改變，令特首更加回應民意；謀劃極不可能成功，但他們不是要破壞，而是望爭取好的結果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭續引述梁的求情信，他明白自己作出違法行為，須承擔責任，而他在過去數年反省，承認案發時部分言行不成熟，對很多人造成傷害，望就此道歉。梁又指，自首提堂後還柙的3年間，他嘗試適應獄中生活，學會處理孤獨，並於獄中度過24至27歲生日，自言感到「迷惘」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;梁晃維求情信從未失對港人信心相信香港能逆風而行&quot;&gt;梁晃維求情信：從未失對港人信心、相信香港能逆風而行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭最後讀出梁求情信最後兩段，梁提到參選立法會時使用「休戚與共，長風破浪」為口號，這並非適合用於遊行集會的感性口號，而是結合他個人對香港的感受和抱負。梁提到，自己在香港主權移交那年出生，他那一代人常被戲稱為「被詛咒的孩子（the cursed children）」，每逢踏入人生新階段都會遇上香港大事——幼稚園畢業遇上「沙士」、小學畢業時是豬流感、中學畢業遇上雨傘運動、大學畢業又遇上反修例運動和疫情，梁自言在與香港同悲同喜的同時，「我深感我的命運與香港緊緊相連。」（“I deeply feel that my fate is deeply tied with Hong Kong.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁指，香港是他成長的地方，是他各種經歷的舞台、是他珍視的價值的搖籃，「我發現我無法輕易切斷與香港的連繫，也無法容忍作為旁觀者。」梁續指，無論未來的人生如何，「我會繼續與香港休戚與共」，為其成功喝采、為其衰落沮喪。梁又指，2019年以來，香港面對複雜和困難的處境，許多人對這個城市的未來感到迷失，「然而，我從來沒有對香港或香港人失去信心。」梁最後指，「憑我們對這片土地的熱愛，以及前人所承傳下來的精神，我相信香港能繼續逆風而行，克服當前挑戰和未知困難。只要我還活着，締造更美好的香港永遠都會是我的終生抱負。」（“As long as I am alive, building a better Hong Kong will always be my lifelong aspiration.”）（梁求情信節錄見文末）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁晃維一方早上完成求情，梁表現平靜，散庭時向旁聽席揮手，又做心形和OK手勢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;庭上讀出的梁晃維求情信節錄中文為記者翻譯&quot;&gt;庭上讀出的梁晃維求情信節錄（中文為記者翻譯）：&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年立法會選舉中，我用了「休戚與共，長風破浪」作為口號，這並非適合用於遊行集會的感性口號，而是結合我個人對香港的感受和抱負。作為生於香港主權移交那年的人，我這一代人常被戲稱為「被詛咒的孩子」，每逢我們踏入人生新階段，香港都會面對疫情或重大事件——幼稚園畢業遇上「沙士」、小學畢業時是「豬流感」、中學畢業遇上雨傘運動、大學畢業又遇上反修例運動和世紀疫情。在與香港同悲同喜的過程中，我深深感覺到我的命運與香港緊緊相連。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;香港是我成長的地方，是我各種經歷的舞台、是我珍視的價值的搖籃。我發現我無法輕易切斷與香港的連繫，也無法容忍作為一名旁觀者。無論我將來的人生如何，我會繼續與香港休戚與共——為其成功喝采、為其衰落沮喪。2019年以來，香港面對複雜和困難的處境，許多人對我城的未來感到迷失，然而，我從來沒有對香港或香港人失去信心。憑藉我們對這片土地的熱愛，以及前人所承傳下來的精神，我相信香港能繼續逆風而行，克服當前挑戰和其他未知困難。只要我還活着，締造更美好的香港永遠都會是我的終生抱負。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2020 Legislative Council election, I used the slogan “sharing weal and woe, braving the winds and tides”. It is not an emotional slogan fit for chanting at rallies or marches. It combines my personal feelings and aspirations for Hong Kong. As someone born in the year of the handover, our generation is often humorously referred to as the “cursed children.” Every time we stepped into a new stage of life, Hong Kong was hit by an epidemic or some significant events - SARS at kindergarten graduation; swine flu at primary school graduation; the Umbrella Movement in high school; when we entered into society after graduating from university, there were the anti-extradition movement and the pandemic of the century. In this process of sharing Hong Kong’s joy and grief, I deeply feel that my fate is tightly linked with Hong Kong’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong is where I grew up; it’s the stage for all kinds of experiences and the cradle of values that I hold dear. I realise that I cannot easily sever ties with Hong Kong nor tolerate being a bystander here. No matter what kind of life I live in the future, I will continue to share weal and woe with Hong Kong - cheering for its successes and feeling downcast about its decline. Since 2019, Hong Kong has been facing complex and difficult situations, many people feel lost about our city’s future. However, I have never lost faith in Hong Kong or its people. With our love for this land and the spirit inherited from our predecessors, I believe Hong Kong will be able to brave the strong winds, overcoming current challenges and other unknown difficulties. As long as I am alive, building a better Hong Kong will always be my lifelong aspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（2日）處理第二批被告、6名港島初選參與者的求情，包括認罪的袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、徐子見，及受審後罪成的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈及彭卓棋。就鄭達鴻、徐子見及楊雪盈3人，辯方指他們案中參與程度低，應歸為「其他參加者」，判監3年以下。其中楊雪盈一方呈上32封求情信，讚揚她對社區和藝術文化的貢獻等；楊又親撰求情信，自言無黨無派，誤信初選合法才參加，誤墮法網「實在愚蠢」。辯方指楊毫不激進，有良好動機，參選只望令社區變得更好，望法庭以「新角度」審視，惟法官陳慶偉一度質疑辯方是指楊不應被定罪、反映楊沒有悔意，又指辯方似是上訴而非求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;徐子見一方透露其父親在他還柙期間離世，徐並親撰求情信稱明白罪行嚴重性，望對受影響的人深切道歉。鄭達鴻一方則指他只是跟從黨立場，他參選後已被DQ，其後宣布退黨、自願停用社交媒體、無再參與政治事務，他誤信初選合法才犯案，沒有重犯機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方楊雪盈屬其他參加者-呈藝文界等32封求情信&quot;&gt;辯方：楊雪盈屬「其他參加者」 呈藝文界等32封求情信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;袁嘉蔚及梁晃維一方完成求情後，由鄭達鴻、徐子見及楊雪盈一方陳詞。辯方認為三人均屬「其他參加者」，量刑起點不應超過3年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表楊雪盈的大律師張耀良，認為楊屬罪責最低的參與者之一，為「其他參加者」；又指雖然法官裁決時依賴從楊搜得的文件將她定罪，但該些文件尚未發布，仍有機會修改，沒有進一步證據顯示她屬「積極參與」。張呈上32封求情信，來自楊本人、家人、朋友、同事、街坊，亦包括前南區區議會副主席司馬文、香港戲劇協會會長馮祿德、藝術發展局前委員張秉權等，顯示楊的多個面向，包括樂善好施、熱心文藝、服務社區，亦參與動物保護、文化保育、表演藝術等，當中沒有一封求情信形容楊是「政客」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中司馬文表示2015年認識楊，二人理念一致，認為不是要推翻而是要加強管治，並望改善香港生活質素，尤其是城市規劃和環保方面。司馬文又形容，楊為溫和民主派，對她的熱情、願意學習維繫社區關係的經驗感到印象深刻，二人任區議員時曾在環境保育等合作。張秉權則指楊本性和善、絕不好鬥，只是跟隨當時的時勢而行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張耀良又引述求情信，指許多人曾受過楊的幫助，例如楊曾邀請單親家長與孩子到她家暫住、給予新移民金錢援助，又曾幫助其他人照顧寵物。有大坑街坊則提到，曾看過很多區議員當選後失蹤，但楊當選後情況改變，讚揚楊全心服務社區，不為政治利益。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊撰求情信稱以為初選合法-愚蠢誤墮法網&quot;&gt;楊撰求情信稱以為初選合法 愚蠢誤墮法網&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張耀良強調，楊雪盈毫不激進、沒有政治聯繫，她對政府不關心她所關注的議題感不滿，相信如能當選立法會議員，便能有助推動她所提倡的政策，這也是她參與初選的唯一原因。張又指，雖然楊被搜得的文件提及否決預算案，但她與其他人有不同的議程，是望令社區變得更好，望法庭能將她與其他人區分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6jyIwmv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
▲ 楊雪盈（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續引述楊所撰的求情信，楊自言出身基層，在香港土生土長，熱愛社會服務、醉心文藝，2015年以此為志當選區議員，得到機會服務弱勢社群、推動動物和文化保育等，形容為社會貢獻是她一生夢寐以求的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊又認為，可就社區問題與政府磋商，落實更好方案，舉例曾成功推動活化閒置用地擴建動物拯救中心、保留香港唯一龍窯「青山龍窯」、改變工廈用途讓藝術家進駐等，均證明政府樂意接受她的意見，是對社會有正面效益的溫和路線。楊自言，自己一直無黨無派，默默為社區貢獻，沒有參與激烈政治行為，參選單純望將上述議題和初心帶去立法會跟進。楊又指，一直以為初選無牴觸《國安法》才愚昧加入，當時新法剛實施，她對法例了解不足，誤墮法網，「現在想來實在愚蠢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方望法庭以新角度審視-官質疑無悔意拒納無意圖傷害政權&quot;&gt;辯方望法庭以新角度審視 官質疑無悔意、拒納無意圖傷害政權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張耀良續指，望法庭聽取求情後，能以一個新角度（new light）審視楊的案情。法官陳慶偉問何謂「新角度」，法官李運騰亦指「我們不能違反我們的事實裁斷」，張解釋是指楊參選立法會，只是望推動其社會政治議程。法官陳仲衡續指已裁定楊具犯案意圖，法官陳慶偉則問，「你是說你的當事人不應被裁定有罪嗎？」，張否認，指他是作求情陳詞。惟陳慶偉即高聲指：「對我來說，你似乎不是在求情，而是提出上訴理據」。張澄清，楊是有良好動機，但採用了錯誤的方法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後再次質疑，根據辯方陳詞，楊雪盈是否對其行為沒有悔意（not sorry for what she did）？張耀良回應指她在求情信已表示對發生的事感抱歉，惟陳慶偉再質疑那並非反映她有悔意（remorse）。張再稱，楊在求情信已表達得很清楚，惟陳再反駁，楊表達得很清楚是一回事，「但你的求情似乎是往相反的方向作出」，「她的求情很清楚，但對我來說，你似乎並不接受！」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰最終問及，辯方求情重點，是否為她有良好品格、出色的公共服務、出於良好動機犯案，張耀良確認。法官陳仲衡並補充，法庭不會接納楊自言「我從不曾意圖傷害政權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方鄭達鴻屬其他參加者被dq後退黨&quot;&gt;辯方：鄭達鴻屬「其他參加者」、被DQ後退黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄭達鴻的資深大律師潘熙指，本案罪行嚴重，但鄭的角色相對輕微，他只是跟從公民黨立場，曾在討論謀劃的階段表達不同意，《國安法》生效後修改政綱，報名參選後亦被DQ，其後沒有再參與「35+計劃」，在串謀再沒有角色。潘又指，鄭於2020年12月發文宣布退黨，不再參與政治；而涉案謀劃不涉武力或威脅使用武力，最終也沒有實現，無對政權造成實際傷害，鄭屬「其他參加者」，應判監3年以下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7scp8fN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄭達鴻（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘又形容，鄭一直希望成為立法會議員，他參與涉案謀劃並非為個人私利，而是望服務公眾及改善基層生活。不過法官李運騰指，若被告是為私利犯案，或屬加刑因素。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方任多年區議員-參選望改善基層生活&quot;&gt;辯方：任多年區議員 參選望改善基層生活&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就鄭的個人背景，潘熙表示鄭達鴻現年36歲，他曾修讀法律博士（JD）和法學專業證書（PCLL），望幫助街坊，並曾任8年丹拿區議員，望法庭考慮他曾參與多年公共服務，具正面良好品格而減刑。潘熙又呈上7封求情信，來自鄭本人、家人、朋友、支持者等，鄭求情信解釋其心路歷程，提到被捕後沒有再使用社交媒體，也沒有再向其他人發訊息。法官陳仲衡一度問，不能使用社交媒體是否其保釋條件，辯方否認，指其保釋條件僅包括不可發放危害國安的訊息，鄭是自願刪除FB專頁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方誤信計劃合法無重犯機會&quot;&gt;辯方：誤信計劃合法、無重犯機會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘又指，《國安法》是新的法律，雖然對法律無知不是辯護理由，但鄭曾供稱公民黨三度諮詢戴耀廷的意見，獲回覆稱初選合法，鄭亦曾自行研究《基本法》條文，湯家驊也受訪稱初選不違法。潘指法庭評估鄭的罪責時，應考慮他是因對《國安法》欠缺理解，誤信法律意見而犯案，而非刻意不遵從（willful disregard）。潘最後指，鄭沒有重犯的機會，他被捕後已辭任區議員、無再使用社交媒體和參與任何政治事務，望考慮他犯案時間短、誤信計劃合法等，給予這個年輕人一次機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KN0mBm9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方徐子見無政治聯繫-屬其他參加者&quot;&gt;辯方：徐子見無政治聯繫 屬「其他參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表徐子見的大律師黃雅斌表示，根據《刑事罪行條例》第159C條串謀罪罰則，法庭有廣闊酌情權根據案情量刑。黃認為，徐屬「其他參加者」，並指串謀中部分參與者是知名人士，由強大的政黨支持，向其他人施壓參與初選，甚至有「三投三不投」運動，指候選人若不參與初選便是「懦夫」；惟徐是獨立候選人，無參與上述活動，其罪責屬最低。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方徐還柙期間父離世撰求情信致歉&quot;&gt;辯方：徐還柙期間父離世、撰求情信致歉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續求情指，徐現年56歲，於香港出生和長大，他最近離婚，育有一名26歲兒子，其母親89歲，父親則於2023年、徐還柙期間離世。黃指，徐患有慢性病，引致嚴重痛楚，法官李運騰關注辯方是否指其病情會令徐服刑時承受更多苦楚，黃僅指其皮膚的狀況惡化，無披露更多詳情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續指，徐是政治素人，沒有任何政治聯繫，從沒有表達激進政治理念，於2014至2015年因健康和家庭出狀況才開始參政，服務社區令他找到人生意義。辯方呈上多封由街坊所撰的求情信，提到徐曾免費維修輪椅和電器、免費剪髮、探望露宿者和長者、為少數族裔義教中文、颱風後協助清除障礙物、處理鼠患等，疫情期間又響應政府呼籲，鼓勵長者接種疫苗。黃形容，徐是「行動派（a man of action）」、是聆聽者，而不只是空談理念的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rnz5cxW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;
▲ 徐子見（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃又引述徐子見親撰求情信，徐提到明白所犯罪行的嚴重性，自知不能逃避罪責，而他未能為社會作出貢獻，反而帶來極為負面的影響，望對受影響的人深切道歉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5名被告今完成求情，明早將由代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀進行求情。散庭時，梁晃維向旁聽席揮手，又雙手放頭做大心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More individuals and organisations in the UK and globally are becoming victims of ransomware. However, little is known about their experiences. This paper sheds light on the victim experience and identifies several key factors that typically shape such experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors are context-specific and can either improve or worsen the victim experience. They include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timing of an incident&lt;/strong&gt;, which may happen after a victim has increased their cyber security measures or at an already stressful time for an organisation, such as the beginning of a school year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level of preparation&lt;/strong&gt; in the form of strong cyber security measures and contingency plans explicitly tailored to respond to a cyber incident.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human factors&lt;/strong&gt;, such as the workplace environment and pre-existing dynamics which are often reinforced during an incident. Good levels of unity can bring staff together during a moment of crisis, but a lack of leadership or a blame culture are likely to aggravate the harm experienced during the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engagement with third-party service providers&lt;/strong&gt;, such as those providing technical incident response or legal services, can alleviate the negative aspects of the victim experience by providing critical legal, technical or other help. However, they may aggravate the harm by providing poor services or losing valuable time in responding to the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A successful &lt;strong&gt;communications campaign&lt;/strong&gt; is highly context and victim specific. It must include external and internal communications with staff members not part of the immediate response to ensure a good workplace culture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For support, many victims turn to public sector institutions such as law enforcement. Expectations for technical support and expertise from law enforcement are generally low, but victims feel especially unsupported where phone calls are not returned and there is no engagement or feedback loop. The National Cyber Security Centre enjoys a better reputation. However, there is widespread uncertainty about its role and the thresholds that must be met for it to provide support. This poses a reputational risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding how ransomware attacks are personally felt by victims and what factors aggravate or alleviate the harm they experience is key for policymakers seeking to implement measures to minimise harm as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary-of-recommendations&quot;&gt;Summary of Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While ransomware causes many kinds of harm, mitigating the psychological impact of ransomware attacks needs to be at the centre of the support given to (potential) victims preparing for and responding to a ransomware incident.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Third-party service providers also need to recognise that efforts mitigating the psychological impact of ransomware attacks are critical to improving victims’ experience. They must therefore form part of their technical, legal or other services.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Public policy on ransomware must centre on measures that mitigate victims’ harm. This includes acknowledging and mitigating the psychological impact on victims, for example through counselling, compensation or time off in lieu.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Victims should aim for the right balance of discretion and transparency within their external and internal communications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third-party service providers should actively enable information sharing, subject to the consent of parties, among past, current and potential victims through their networks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Law enforcement and intelligence agencies should establish a positive feedback loop that shares success stories and notifies victims when the information they share has been successfully used for intelligence and law enforcement activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Government authorities need to clarify the tasks of relevant public institutions and their role in the ransomware response, including who can receive support and under what circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given year-on-year increases in the frequency of incidents, the resourcing of the Information Commissioner’s Office should be routinely assessed to enable timely assessments of ransomware breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When staff at Hackney Council encountered outages of its IT systems in October 2020, it quickly became evident that the council was facing a cyber attack. But the employees did not know that they would be dealing with its effects for years. Those who experience a ransomware attack experience a crisis, possibly even an existential threat for an attacked organisation and its staff. For those involved, it represents a low point in their professional and possibly even private lives, with consequences that are felt far beyond the immediate response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Hackney Council, staff members had to improvise while their access to data and technology was disrupted, working long hours to compensate for the technical problems. Meanwhile, more than 250,000 residents living in the borough faced disruptions and delays to critical council services, including housing benefits, social care, council tax and business rates. Years after the incident, the repercussions were still being felt. These insights are based on unusually detailed public reporting of the aftermath of Hackney Council’s ransomware incident. However, they still provide few details on the actual victim experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staff and residents of Hackney Council are, of course, not the only ones affected by ransomware attacks. Ransomware criminals continue to target businesses of all sizes, as well as schools, healthcare providers, universities, charities and government entities. Prominent examples of 2023 ransomware victims in the UK include Royal Mail, an NHS trust and the outsourcing firm Capita, which handles the British Army’s recruitment process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the mid-2010s, ransomware has emerged as one of the most harmful forms of cyber-criminal activity for organisations. Ransomware operators encrypt files or systems, demanding a ransom payment in return for a private key to decrypt the affected data. Increasingly, ransomware operators also exfiltrate victims’ data and threaten to leak it on the darknet unless a ransom is paid. For an organisation and its employees this can be an extremely stressful, high-pressure incident that causes a wide range of harm to individuals, organisations and society at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although more individuals and organisations are becoming victims of ransomware attacks, little is known about the victim experience. Reporting often focuses on financial implications or technical details. In contrast, this paper sheds light on how organisations and their staff experience a ransomware attack. It offers a particular focus on the specific factors that – for better or worse – influence this experience. These factors include: the scale and timing of the incident; the size of the victim organisation; the level of preparation undertaken by the victim organisation prior to the ransomware event; the nature of the existing workplace culture; and the experience of dealing with third parties that form part of the ransomware response ecosystem, including the UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and law enforcement; the role of communication; and the role of transparency and information sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offering such detailed insights into the victims’ experiences of a ransomware attack gives policymakers, cyber security professionals and practitioners in the ransomware response ecosystem key knowledge. This is pivotal when designing effective response plans and policy measures and conducting incident response. It is also essential for providing personalised support to any victims. The research findings for this paper also inform any organisation or individual preparing for a possible ransomware attack or other cyber incident of what challenges they might face and how they can prepare for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is structured as follows. Chapter I draws findings from, and identifies research gaps in, existing research, reporting and data that build an understanding of the victim experience. Chapter II summarises the findings from the original research to identify the factors that influence the ransomware victim experience, including: the scale and timing of the incident; the size of the victim organisation; the level of preparation undertaken by the victim organisation prior to the ransomware event; the nature of the existing workplace culture; and the experience of dealing with third parties that form part of the ransomware response ecosystem. The third-party organisations included in the analysis are those that were seen as most significant by interviewees and workshop participants. These are lawyers, insurance providers, incident responders, ransom negotiators and public relations firms. Chapter III analyses the role of public sector bodies, including local and regional police, the NCSC, the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). The paper concludes with a range of policy recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is part of a series of research publications resulting from a 12-month research project, “Ransomware Harms and the Victim Experience”, conducted by RUSI and the University of Kent. The project is funded by the UK’s NCSC and the Research Institute for Sociotechnical Cyber Security. Its aim is to understand the wide range of harm caused by ransomware attacks to individuals, organisations and society at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research project focuses on the question: How is a ransomware attack experienced by victims, and what factors aggravate or reduce the negative experience(s)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data collection and analysis for this paper entailed a literature review, semi-structured interviews and workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Literature Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project started with a literature review of publicly available sources on ransomware harm and ransomware victims. It included a non-systematic review of publicly available academic and grey literature, including surveys and reports produced by stakeholders of the ransomware ecosystem. The initial literature review was conducted in August and September 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Semi-Structured Interviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary dataset for the paper is based on 42 semi-structured online interviews with both victims of ransomware attacks and subject-matter experts from across the ransomware ecosystem, including individuals from the insurance industry, government, law enforcement and incident responders. An overview of the background of interviewees is provided in Tables 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees from ransomware victim organisations included both IT and non-IT staff. The scope of the interviews included personnel at a ransomed organisation; the research team did not interview wider knock-on victims (for example, those in supply chains or clients). Non-victim interviewees were selected for their breadth and depth of experience that involved multiple ransomware incidents spanning several years. Interviewees were predominantly from the UK, although a limited number were based in the US or other countries in Western Europe. Interviews were conducted between November 2022 and March 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All interview data was anonymised to allow individuals to speak openly about potentially sensitive issues. The research team then analysed the interview transcripts using a thematic analysis approach,which involved generating codes that reoccurred in interviews and identifying themes that provided insight into the research questions. The analysis was conducted using NVIVO. An anonymised coding system based on Tables 1 and 2 is used to refer to interview data in the footnotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Breakdown of Victim Interviewees&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workshops&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team conducted two online workshops with key stakeholders from the UK government, the insurance and cyber security industries, lawyers and law enforcement. They were held in November 2022 and February 2023. Attendees included a mix of interviewees and new participants, using contacts established during the interview phase. The first workshop was used for data gathering. The second workshop was used to validate the research findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research project has been based on a large data corpus, drawing on interviews with ransomware victims and stakeholders from the ecosystem who support ransomware victims. Data collection therefore relied on the voluntary participation of ransomware victims and their support ecosystem. Understandably, victims of ransomware are often hesitant or unwilling to speak of their experience. The authors note the possibility of some participatory selection bias; for instance, ransomware victim interviewees who were willing to voluntarily give up their time to speak to the research team may also have been more likely to reach out to law enforcement or report to the ICO. It is also possible that ransomware victims who were willing to describe their experiences in a voluntary research setting may also have been less likely to have paid a negotiated ransom. Additionally, the majority of interviewees were UK-based; it is possible that geographic and, especially, cultural contexts affect ransomware experiences. The findings from this research therefore cannot be said to represent a universal ransomware experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the findings of this project provide insights from a “snapshot” of the ransomware victim experience across a particular timeframe, with interviews ending in March 2023. As highlighted from this project’s data corpus, ransomware victims’ experiences are not the same; there is substantial variability that depends on internal and external factors. As ransomware is a dynamic threat that continues to evolve, it is important that researchers continue to engage with victims of ransomware to further build the understanding of how the experiences of future victims can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-existing-insights-on-the-ransomware-victim-experience&quot;&gt;I. Existing Insights on the Ransomware Victim Experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each ransomware incident is unique, although collectively ransomware experiences have much in common. A ransomware attack will typically follow a set of stages involving an initial attempt to access an IT estate, a successful breach, followed by further access across the network. The attackers will then seek to gain greater privileges, identify their desired sections of the network, exfiltrate data (if they are exfiltrating) and deliver their encryption payload (if they are encrypting). The attackers will then typically either use a splash screen or otherwise make contact with the victim to encourage them to commence discussions about ransom payment. As a general timeline, once a ransomware victim notices that they have been breached and/or have been contacted by the ransomware operators, there generally follows an immediate crisis period – which could last days or weeks – during which they seek to contain the attackers’ access, restore core systems and assess what data may have been exfiltrated. During this time, the organisation may or may not be able to operate normal functions. This core crisis period is followed by a gradual or staggered transition to normal operations. Victims of ransomware will often draw on the support of a range of third-party services, including but not limited to: cyber insurers; incident responders; ransom negotiators; lawyers; public relations services; and law enforcement or national cyber authorities (such as the NCSC in the UK). The roles that these services can play in influencing the ransomware victim’s experiences are explored later in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some understanding of “typical” ransomware victim experiences can be acquired through news reports and existing analyses of mostly objective factors, such as the financial and temporal impact of an attack. A novel study by Nandita Pattnaik and others drew on public reporting relating to a range of ransomware incidents to identify the scale and depth of harms to the victim organisation(s). More broadly, media attention focuses on the scale and scope of contemporary criminal ransomware activity, and the significant disruption that can be caused to organisations. An example of a widely reported ransomware incident is the DarkSide attack against Colonial Pipeline, a US gas supplier, in May 2021. As a result of the incident, the company switched off its pipeline systems for six daysand reportedly paid the attackers $4.4 million. Other attacks may be more prolonged. In October 2020 in the UK, Hackney Council was attacked by the Pysa ransomware group, which encrypted systems and exfiltrated sensitive data. A range of the council’s services, including critical services such as housing benefit and social care services, were not fully operable for roughly a year. In October 2022, it was reported that the cost of Hackney Council’s recovery effort in the prior financial year exceeded £12 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports on ransomware attacks often depend on the information released either by a victim organisation or their legal representatives, or possibly the attackers themselves. For example, in January 2022 the British convenience food manufacturer, KP Snacks, was attacked by the Conti ransomware group. The attack became publicly known on 2 February, after the firm sent a letter to its distributors notifying them of a cyber attack. The Conti group darknet leak page shared examples of sensitive employee data – including birth certificates and credit card statements – and the group allegedly gave KP Snacks five days to pay a demanded ransom to prevent more proprietary data from being leaked. It is not clear what was the value of the ransom, whether it was paid, and how prolonged the impact within the company was. In such instances, insights into the victim experience are highly limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other reports have assessed a range of ransomware attacks in aggregation to quantify average ransomware impacts. Expense and downtime can be used as broad measures of victim harms and/or experience. For example, the most recent annual Sophos State of Ransomware report identified that the average ransom payment had reached more than $1.5 million (the median was $400,000).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ninety-seven percent of victims were reportedly able to regain access to their data, with backups the most common recovery method (70%), while 46% of victims elected to pay the ransom for a decryption key. The average overall recovery cost for victim organisations was reported to be $1.82 million. Drawing on Kovrr’s cyber incident database, a 2022 report by Check Point Research identified that the average “attack duration” was 9.9 days in 2021. However, while providing valuable information, these statistics reduce the victim to an abstract number and statistical event and do not account for the deeply personal experience a victim goes through when their organisation has been affected by a ransomware incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide further insights into the victim experience beyond these initial metrics, academics and researchers conducted surveys and interviews with ransomware victims. This approach can enable more in-depth understanding and analysis of a given ransomware event. The ethical frameworks governing academic research may also provide assurances to ransomware victims, for example regarding anonymisation and data handling, which give the victims confidence to speak. This could include research into events that are not reported in-depth publicly. Leah Zhang-Kennedy and others focused on a ransomware incident at a US university, surveying 150 students and faculty members and interviewing 30 individuals to gain a range of perspectives about a single incident. Harry Harvey and others and Jane Y Zhao and others have conducted studies that have drawn insights from interviews with medical staff at healthcare organisations subject to ransomware, identifying the impact the incidents had on colleagues’ provision of care, and their emotional toll. A 2020 study by Lena Yuryna Connolly and others drew on original interviews with IT and security managers from 10 organisations to identify attack characteristics including ransom value and the nature of lost data. A study by the UK’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp;amp; Sport drew on interviews involving 10 victim organisations that had experienced a range of ransomware or non-ransomware cyber breaches – with two employees from each – to develop case studies, exploring each organisation’s context and the impact of their cyber breach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb, wider news reporting and annual summaries of ransomware attacks primarily focus on financial impacts or offer technical insights on how they were conducted. These are invaluable as a means of providing insight into the occurrence of ransomware and general trends and it is vital that journalists, private companies, governments and NGOs continue to publish frequently. However, the experiences of the individuals in the midst of the event are rarely discussed in reports and summaries. The interview-based research for this paper is an approach that can bring individuals and their experiences to the fore. Ransomware is a dynamic threat that has continued to change over time with, for example, new attack modalities, the emergence of ransomware-as-a-service and altered negotiation strategies. As such, academics, the wider public and policymakers must conduct further research to develop an understanding of the multi-faceted immediate, mid-term and long-term ransomware victim experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-factors-affecting-the-victim-experience&quot;&gt;II. Factors Affecting the Victim Experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaining new understanding of what it is like to experience a ransomware incident helps policymakers to design policy interventions. Such interventions can explicitly consider evidence that demonstrates where harm occurs as well as what can alleviate the negative aspects of such experiences. Understanding the victim experience is an essential requirement to design effective policy interventions that counter victims’ harm. This chapter illustrates what victims experience and what factors alleviate or elevate the harm caused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is structured around several key themes that impact the victim experience and that were identified based on the interview data and workshops: the scale and timing of the incident; the size of the victim organisation; the level of preparation undertaken by the victim organisation prior to the ransomware event; the nature of the existing workplace culture; the experience dealing with third parties; the role of communications; and the role of transparency and information sharing. Figure 1 illustrates how the various elements interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-scale-timing-and-context-of-the-incident&quot;&gt;The Scale, Timing and Context of the Incident&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The victim experience naturally depends on the scale and technical impact of the incident: the percentage and type of data encrypted, locked or exfiltrated might vary. A victim in the education sector, for example, found that all email servers and backups were encrypted but their database was not affected. Other interviewees experienced breaches that resulted in the encryption of core company systems, creating significant business interruption and organisation-wide disruption. The nature of the exfiltrated data may have a significant influence on the victim experience, especially where it involves the compromise of sensitive data. In other instances, the threat actors either did not exfiltrate data or siphone data that was of little material concern to the victim organisation. An interviewee from the education sector recalled their relief when the threat actors only threatened to release generic invoices rather than sensitive student data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HAQDo0e.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Factors Shaping the Ransomware Victim Experience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timing of an incident further influences the damage to victims and their ability to successfully respond to the attack. Many cybercriminals are known to time their attacks to inflict the maximum harm on victims. This increases the pressure to pay ransoms. For example, an attacker may launch attacks against the education sector at the beginning of a term or during exam periods. Additionally, prominent ransomware criminals are typically located in different time zones from their victims, naturally facilitating “out-of-office attacks”. Several interviewees reported that they were made aware of a successful breach during the night or while on annual leave. A common, although not universal, perspective was that the first tangible signs of a spreading encryption payload were the takedown of monitored on-site health and safety systems, including fire alarms and CCTV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Covid-19 pandemic substantially shaped the external context for many victims. Some interviewees found that pandemic-related IT and work-from-home practices had made them more resilient, as much data had been moved to the cloud and people were accustomed to remote working or learning. For an interviewee in local government, the pandemic tested skills that were similarly required in responding to the attack – it was therefore a useful point of reference. Others found that the pandemic and their ransomware incident had a cumulative negative impact on themselves or their colleagues. For example, for one victim, pandemic-related practices had already cost staff much energy and resources and the incident thus came at a time when “people were already [at] rock bottom in terms of morale and resilience”. New working patterns established during the pandemic also made one victim’s IT estate more vulnerable as many devices were no longer switched off regularly due to remote working and did not therefore automatically update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the timing of an incident may, or may not, also coincide with internal procedures – this has an impact on how harmful the experience is for victims. While it might seem odd to speak of an “ideally timed” ransomware incident, timing can reduce possible negative experiences. For example, several victims reported that their incidents hit just after they had made payroll. Had they been unable to pay their employees, the harm for those individuals as well as the victim organisation would have been greater. Another victim experienced fortunate timing as the attack hit them several months after the organisation had run cyber exercises that resulted in hiring experts trained in responding to cyber incidents. As noted above, others had recently moved their systems to the cloud, ensuring access after the ransomware breach, thus alleviating some of the harm. In other cases, victims felt that the timing of the ransomware incident was particularly bad, with their breach occurring at a time of low budgets or acutely low staff morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much an organisation depends on its IT infrastructure or how time-sensitive its business is may also influence the degree of harm and disruption that the organisation and/or its staff experience. Victims operating in acutely time-sensitive client-facing contexts may lose contracts if they are unable to resume operations within a matter of days. In such contexts, the high stakes of an acutely time-sensitive incident response elevate pressure on colleagues handling the response effort. On the other hand, other interviewees reported that they had the (relative) luxury of time in their recovery effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timing, scale and context of the ransomware attack are therefore significant factors influencing the harm caused to and the fallout experienced by an organisation and its staff. Policymakers, business leaders and practitioners thus need to consider that while victims share similar experiences, individual circumstances and the extent of the attack heavily influence how much a victim is affected. These factors also contribute to how personally a ransomware incident is felt by its victims, a sentiment that was repeated throughout this research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;size-of-organisation&quot;&gt;Size of Organisation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size of a company can also influence the extent of the impact in a ransomware attack. This has also been confirmed in other reports. While larger companies typically operate a more expansive IT estate – which may include layers of end-of-life software – such organisations are likely to offset associated risks through their access to greater cash reserves either to pay a ransom and/or afford third-party help. They might also have a designated IT team, incident responders or lawyers on retainer and generally have greater experience in crisis management. This makes larger companies more resilient and less dependent on publicly available resources and expertise. Smaller companies or sole traders, however, may lack designated IT staff, the resources or the experience to successfully manage a ransomware attack. As a result, a ransomware attack can be significant, if not existential to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are often more dependent on public resources and expertise. One interviewee who provides third-party services said that the impact on lives is particularly prevalent for very small business, for example where a couple are in business together and all their assets and income depend on that business. The interviewee found that “the existential threat for a business that’s much smaller is significant”. An interview with a micro-SME victim suggested that without the financial support and access to expertise provided through a cyber insurance policy, the firm would have ceased to trade and the business owner would have needed to sell their home. Additional pressure may arise for small business owners for whom their livelihoods and those of their employees are at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While limited in its insights on small business owners, the interview data raises questions about the impact of a company’s size on the harm experienced by ransomware victims. This has also been addressed in public reports, such as the news reports on the ransomware attack against hospitality and casino giant MGM Resorts. Such reports have questioned whether the company was “too rich to ransomware”, arguing that the impact was lower because of its large size. In contrast, other studies underline the disproportionate effect that is felt by small business owners or sole traders who become ransomware victims. While individuals working in large or small organisations may experience similar harm, such as psychological, on an individual level organisational size matters in terms of the financial harm and potential existential risk an organisation faces. Policymakers must consider that, to limit the harm felt by ransomware victims, organisations of different sizes might require different types and levels of government support in responding to ransomware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;level-of-preparation&quot;&gt;Level of Preparation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An organisation’s level of preparation prior to the incident is a significant factor determining the harm that a victim experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existence and suitability of business continuity plans, for example, was repeatedly cited throughout the research project. The general assumption is that when an organisation has a “good resilience strategy, they can put in place a recovery process that would take days as opposed to weeks” and that such measures would allow them to resume services and thereby “minimise impact to the individual consumers”. While many interviewees stressed the importance of preparation to limit the harm ransomware attacks cause, this research project also found that many doubted the suitability of existing business continuity plans to respond to a ransomware attack. Business continuity plans for flooding or fire emergencies have little in common with those setting up response mechanisms to a ransomware or other cyber incident. As a victim in the education sector described: “people always have … business continuity plans … but actually they tend to go out of the window”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business continuity plans for incidents other than ransomware or IT outages often presume that IT systems, such as email, continue to function and can be used to facilitate the crisis response. In practice, however, it is often the case that “There is no email. There is no Excel. Think pencil. Think paper”. Another interviewee noted that for “traditional”, more routine crises, they would typically bring in contractors to resolve the issue and pay them through the invoicing system, which was no longer possible during the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific preparation for a cyber incident, by pre-emptively increasing “resilience”, can help alleviate the harm victims experience. Business continuity plans need to be tailored, while retaining sufficient flexibility to adapt to variables such as the threat actor, attack modality, severity and scale of encryption or exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to prepare is by identifying essential systems for core organisational functionality. This guides the victim to set priorities for their incident response. A victim in the education sector, for example, stressed the importance of the student portals to enable students to study for exams. An incident responder recalled their experience of supporting a manufacturer, who insisted that their canteen facility must be restored as an urgent priority in the interests of maintaining staff morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to prepare is by running scenario tests, as undertaken by a victim in the engineering sector, who subsequently hired additional staff as a result of the exercise, whom they described as “absolutely critical” in the response to the ransomware incident the company experienced a few months later. A ransomware specialist mentioned pre-drafted communications and legal statements as a proactive way to successfully prepare for a ransomware attack. Several interviewees stressed that the ransomware business continuity documents themselves should be stored offline in analogue format to ensure access is possible following an encryption event. Policymakers and those trying to raise awareness and preparation levels among potential victims must thus continue to stress the importance of cyber-specific preparation that takes into account the unique features of a cyber incident instead of relying on generic contingency plans that are unsuitable in a digitalised context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific preparation for a cyber incident is tightly linked to the overall level of cyber hygiene and cyber awareness a victim organisation may have prior to the incident. As one interviewee from the technology sector pointed out, preparatory measures are “far more effective than just leaning in after the incident”. Particularly in the public sector, however, digitalisation has been a lengthy process. One victim described how in their institution they had to recover server-by-server as the integration between devices and data flows were “a nightmare”. Similarly, another victim from the education sector described how, at an earlier point, they used technology, but that they had “not paid enough attention to the kind of infrastructure and the security” that was needed. In hindsight, they said that they should not have been running old systems and ought to have allocated the budget “to do it properly”. However, this has financial implications. In the private sector, there are also examples of missing cyber security measures. An interviewee from the technology sector, for example, admitted that “probably there were things that we knew we should improve but because we were so busy we didn’t do them”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may include the availability and quality of backups, particularly ones that are offline. An external counsel described a situation where there are no viable backups as the “worst case”. They stressed that such a difficult situation may be business critical and lead victims to consider paying the ransom where attempts to recover the data from other sources are unsuccessful. Furthermore, good detection capabilities may enable a victim to identify the attack early and take measures to mitigate further harm or even disrupt the attacker. Such damage limitation can significantly reduce the severity of the overall incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a good awareness of the amount and kind of data an organisation stores helps it to react to the incident. One interviewee from law enforcement pointed out that many organisations do not “really realise how sensitive some of the data is that they hold”. They added that smaller organisations, as well as those from the public sector, are particularly impacted by ransomware attacks due to the type of data they hold. The interviewee gave an example of a law firm holding data on victims of sexual offences and people being accused of being sex offenders. As a consequence, “each individual person within that dataset became quite vulnerable quite quickly … because their names should never be released”. Similarly, an interviewee with third-party experience from the insurance sector found that unnecessarily holding a lot of personal data would be a factor that aggravates the victim experience, while good data management practices such as deleting data they no longer need or should not have can reduce that risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General cyber security hygiene, good data privacy practice and specific cyber incident preparation can alleviate the harm experienced. Policymakers and public institutions must continue to raise awareness of such measures, particularly for small and micro-enterprises. When determining budgets for often tightly resourced public service providers, policymakers must allocate a budget for digitalisation and modernisation that goes beyond purchasing new technological equipment and considers the implementation and continued evaluation and adaption of cyber security standards. This also means that it is necessary to invest in adequate training or hiring dedicated IT staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pre-existing-workplace-culture&quot;&gt;Pre-Existing Workplace Culture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interview data highlights the importance of the pre-existing workplace culture in aggravating or limiting ransomware harm. A ransomware attack is likely to intensify existing sentiment within and between teams. As one interviewee stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the stronger [the] culture you have, the more coherent, the more resilient that business will be to something like this happening … whereas internally, if you already have a poor culture, you have people that are quite disgruntled, then for whatever those reasons might be, you’re particularly vulnerable to this having a disproportionate effect on morale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interviewee, from a local government organisation, confirmed that the attack “definitely exacerbated areas where there were tensions anyway”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interviewee went as far as stating that a good workplace culture has a greater impact on the ransomware victim experience than “a really well-prepared tech system”, as morale and culture cannot be replaced but may have a disproportionate impact on people’s resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decisive factor is the overall atmosphere and level of cooperation among co-workers. A victim in the education sector spoke of a “real good spirit” among the team in response to the attack: people even wanted to help and unexpectedly came into the office, bringing cookies and cake. In this example, the interviewee stated that the ransomware attack brought the team really “close to each other in the end” and such bonds have continued to benefit the team spirit. Similarly, another interviewee in the education sector referred to an experience that strengthened the ethos at work like a “wartime spirit. Everybody pulled together”. A similar observation was made by participants from the local government sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees linked the two themes of organisational preparation and pre-existing workplace culture. This identified the need for a clear allocation of jobs and responsibilities. Where tasks were clearly attributed, victims experienced less chaos and seemed to better stay on top of the incident, an important factor contributing to the maintenance of morale and the reduction of harm. It also helps to avoid duplication of efforts, which can be especially costly when hired third parties are involved. Additionally, the allocation of tasks should be accompanied by situational awareness; this reinforces the utility of pre-incident wargaming. An incident responder highlighted that chief information security officers (CISOs) and data protection officers were acutely at risk of being overwhelmed. They recalled a typical case where the CISO was “this one guy in the middle, who was the fundamental access point for all of the activity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The allocation of jobs is closely linked to the reaction of, and leadership from, senior management and the board. Their role can help to alleviate harm or add additional burden. A victim in the technology sector felt that “we were ill equipped at senior leadership level to deal with this”, particularly regarding job allocation. An incident responder went as far as to say that the technical response to an incident is the easy part and that, instead, leadership rather than technical expertise is the overriding factor. A ransomware specialist explained that “one thing that makes [the experience] better is a strong CEO leadership or a strong senior board leadership, making a decision right at the beginning how they’re gonna deal with this and taking responsibility”. For example, the board may take additional action to support the incident response team. One interviewee explained how the chairman provided an additional office freezer for ice-cream, which was intended to be gentle on the stomach during late-night working. Conversely, the coordinator of a ransomware response at a charity organisation resented that senior management did not offer use of an existing apartment in the office building for rest and food consumption. In their case, the combination of lack of sleep, poor nutrition and excessive consumption of caffeine necessitated a visit to A&amp;amp;E.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extreme exertion that may be required to recover from ransomware – especially for IT staff – supports the organisation but may degrade the wellbeing of staff through sleep deprivation, physical inactivity, poor nutrition and strained relationships. As the primary interest of the board or trustees often remains the financial impact on an organisation, there is a risk of overlooking the physiological and psychological impact the ransomware attack might have on individuals. As an indication of a common trend, one IT expert in the charity sector stressed that they would have liked to see more support from senior management, for example with respect to looking after the health of the core team responding to the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not isolated to the ransomware crisis itself and can include a post-ransomware workplace legacy. One victim described how, after the incident had been resolved, they had to work harder and took longer to do tasks due to additional fail-safes, for example when manually creating reports that were normally done automatically. They added that they felt that “nobody cared that we were working harder” as the bottom line was the core concern. Messaging from senior leadership can also influence staff morale and the working environment during and after a ransomware event. Particularly where cyber awareness is low, board members or trustees might engage in a culture of blame, for example by accusing the IT team of failing to do its job. One victim described how there was no clear messaging from leadership, for example on communication about the incident. Given the lack of cyber awareness among senior staff members, IT staff also, at times, find themselves “leading the charge”, as a victim in the charity sector explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the role of senior management might be proactive and supportive, realising that a ransomware attack is not just an IT problem. In these cases, senior management can prevent burnout of team members, making sure to rotate staff and providing them with time off. In local government, for example, staff of a victim organisation were given extra holidays and paid time off once the immediate response was over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This highlights that responding to a ransomware attack must be thought of as a marathon, not a sprint. Many interviewees and, particularly, incident responders and external counsels stressed this point. Some of them highlighted that one of the first things they do is advise on the need to rotate staff and prevent burnout. This is true for staff at the victim organisation, but equally applies to third parties, such as incident responders. Such responders run a high risk of burnout and therefore need to rotate between incidents or have leave provided to limit the stress they experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general workplace culture is therefore a critical factor that determines how victims perceive a ransomware incident. While policymakers and cyber security professionals cannot have an impact on workplace culture, they can stress the important role that it plays in preparing for, and responding to, incidents. This includes drawing attention to the critical role of senior management and board members in managing the ransomware incident. Awareness and educational training must highlight the positive effects that stem from a clear division of tasks and vision for the response. Furthermore, awareness campaigns and best-practice guidance can outline practical examples of how to provide support for the core response team and avoid a culture of blame. Boards and senior management must also be cyber aware – this is a key aspect of an existing work culture that can contribute to alleviating the ransomware harm. New legal obligations and/or training of boards and senior management can achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;paying-or-not-paying-a-ransom-demand&quot;&gt;Paying (or Not Paying) a Ransom Demand&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees frequently spoke of the influence of ransom payments on the victim experience. The project team interviewed individuals from both ransom-paying and non-paying victim organisations. Only a minority of victim organisations who took part in the interviews paid ransoms. Two interviewees noted that their organisation made a ransom payment because it was the most efficient solution to decrypt affected systems in an acutely time-sensitive context. Another interviewee noted that their organisation had paid a ransom because they were very keen to dissuade the threat actors from releasing sensitive exfiltrated data. While the overall number of ransom-payers is limited relative to the number of interviewees, there are nonetheless significant insights that can be gleaned from the role that ransom payment (or non-payment) has in influencing the ransomware victim experience. Importantly, apart from select government or law enforcement interviews, interviewees were typically not directly asked about the morality of ransom payments or whether ransom payments should be permitted or prohibited. Rather, the focus was on the experience of paying (or not paying) a ransom and how this positively or negatively impacted the victim’s journey through a ransomware incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the cases above, the payment of the ransom significantly alleviated the harms experienced. Payment of the ransom meant, for example, that students were able to complete their exams in the usual way. This would not have been possible if the victim, who came from the European education sector, had sought to restore systems without a decryption key. For a victim working in the technology sector, the ransom payment was the only viable option to keep the company afloat. For the outsourcing firm, the payment of the ransom meant that, at least at the time of writing, the threat actors had not released exfiltrated data. While anecdotal, these case studies highlight that, in some situations, the payment of a demanded or negotiated ransom can significantly alleviate harms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, however, important to note that interview data also highlighted that a ransom payment is not a silver bullet. A ransomware negotiator noted that in their experience, all ransomware operators will eventually “go rogue”. For example, they may re-extort from the same victim after a ransom payment has been made, they may not deliver operable decryption keys, or they may renege on promises and release or sell exfiltrated data. Other studies have confirmed such outcomes, finding that a high percentage of victims who pay are victimised again. Similarly, studies report that not everyone paying a ransom actually recovers their data. In this light, whether a ransom payment successfully alleviates the harm that is experienced depends on the good faith of the ransomware operators and the technical efficacy of their malware (and decryption keys).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it is important to note that the payment of a ransom does not absolve a victim organisation of its obligations to report the incident to the ICO; the breach has still occurred. The compounding of reputational risk was cited as a concern. Non-paying victims noted that there was a stigma attached to paying organised criminals a ransom and noted that had they made a payment, it would have adversely affected their relationship with clients or other stakeholders. The logistics of making the ransom payment, including accessing large quantities of Bitcoin, can also be challenging. One ransom payer recalled that the process of multiple bank authorisation checks to purchase increments of Bitcoin was arduous and compounded their stress. It is worth noting that UK banks have increasingly prohibited customer access to cryptocurrency exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision on whether to pay a ransom weighed heavily on victims. Of course, paying a ransom is also a financial decision (see Figure 2), but whether to pay a ransom also raises other considerations for victims. An interviewee from a victim organisation that elected to pay a ransom noted that the decision-making was difficult and stressful for the executive board. A ransomware specialist noted that victim organisations that agonise over whether to pay a ransom prolong the initial (and most stressful) crisis phase of the ransomware event. Conversely, those that quickly ruled out a ransom payment were able to focus their energy on the rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The payment of a demanded or negotiated ransom can thus both positively and negatively influence the ransomware victim experience. Preparedness is important. This should include delegating decisions to individuals to make payment decisions. Organisational leadership must also bear in mind that the payment of a ransom does not guarantee restoration of access to encrypted files or systems, nor the deletion of exfiltrated data. It is also important that organisations adhere to local regulations on reporting and sanctions compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experience of Dealing with Third Parties in the Ransomware Response Ecosystem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section looks at some of the third parties a ransomware victim might typically be in contact with when reacting to a ransomware attack and further explores the degree to which these interactions influence the victim experience. Given the key role of law enforcement and other public sector service providers, Chapter III is dedicated to their impact on the victim experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How organisations interact with third parties in the ransomware ecosystem is an essential component of the victim experience. Some victims have a very positive experience in their engagement with external parties. One victim in the private sector stressed that “we were really looked after”. Others gave less credit to external parties and stressed that, ultimately, they were alone in the experience. The interview data confirms that the interaction with third parties is an important factor for the victim experience. As a ransomware specialist phrased it: “harm does get amplified if [victims] don’t have good advice”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the key third parties and their services are highlighted in Figure 3 and explored in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lawyers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many victims acknowledged that legal advice on the repercussions of a ransomware attack is necessary, particularly on the implications of the data breach and potential lawsuits that might cause further harm. Increasingly, however, lawyers are consulted at the very beginning of an incident and subsequently manage relationships with all parties involved. One victim said lawyers helped with the risk assessment for exfiltrated data, particularly to assess the scope of potential lawsuits coming from those whose data has been exfiltrated. However, as lawyers are often tasked with avoiding potential further harms, their positive impact may be less tangible for victims. Additionally, lawyers typically work to protect the organisation as a single entity, rather than the individuals connected to it. Here, again, the interview data may speak to a dichotomy between the success and failure of the organisation and the real-time experiences of staff at the organisation. Some victims conveyed a negative experience dealing with lawyers, primarily stressing that the involvement of a legal team often meant that lawyers limited communications and information sharing about the incident – including as a precaution due to perceived legal risks. A victim in the education sector confirmed that the legal team was “really tight on what we could and couldn’t say”. This meant that they could only communicate that there was a cyber attack, but not a ransomware attack, which “made things hard at times”. One victim also felt that restrictions imposed by the legal team prevented them from sharing information, for example sharing technical indicators with the NCSC. Others also reported that they were unable to share information, and therefore were unable to warn colleagues in other institutions. This led to feelings of guilt when a later attack against an acquaintance might have been prevented had a warning been shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hrV3HMM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Examples of Private Sector Third Parties Offering Victims Services and Support&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of legal wraparound on the ability of victims to share their experiences was also noticed by an interviewee from law enforcement. They stated that they “definitely found it hard to engage with organisations freely once a law firm becomes involved”. While they respected the lawyer’s prerogative to act in the best interest of their clients, the law enforcement interviewee nevertheless felt that it impacted their ability to “respond effectively”, for example, because they cannot take down an exfiltrated dataset if they do not know about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawyers therefore reduce the harm to individuals and organisations in less tangible ways, for example by preventing future lawsuits. However, their concern over the legal implications stemming from oversharing information limits information and knowledge exchange. Their requirements to tightly control information are therefore perceived to potentially contribute to strained experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insurance Providers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although most organisations do not have cyber insurance, interviewees from organisations that did were overwhelmingly positive about their interactions with cyber insurance providers. Interviewees credited their coordinating function and their ability to convene appropriate external service providers at speed. For example, one victim was “amazed at the scale and quality of support that was very quickly in place”. Another victim confirmed the central role of their insurance provider in the steering process, stating that without that service the start of recovery would have been delayed and taken a lot longer. Similarly, another victim confirmed that without insurance they would not have known how to find the right experts and would have taken much more valuable time to do so, describing having cyber insurance as “absolutely pivotal”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This data confirms the central role of insurance providers in coordinating the ransomware response and correlates with similar findings from prior research. There were two core benefits. First, access to a support network: “it’s the expertise and the people and how quickly you can assemble the team”. The value of cyber insurance in helping to manage the response is particularly important for smaller organisations given they are much less likely to have incident response or legal services on a retainer. Second, insurance provides access to a financial cushion: for example, one interviewee described the benefit of cyber insurance as allowing the company to respond to the attack without concerns over cost. Another victim, the director of a micro-SME, found that having insurance “saved everything”, and that without it “it would have been totals”, including the need to sell their home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The support and experience of insurance providers might also alleviate some of the stress and mental harm experienced by victims. One victim added that they were impressed that the insurers “were completely unflappable. They stood behind us straight away”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incident Responders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees painted a mixed picture with respect to the impact of incident responders. They were generally perceived as providing critical work limiting the – often technical – harm that victims experienced. This is especially true for organisations that do not have in-house IT teams with experience of handling ransomware incidents. Such organisations may feel that they are out of their depth in dealing with a ransomware incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the context of external incident response support matters. One incident responder confirmed that in the past six months they were the second firm to be called to a case for roughly 50% of their ransomware cases. Some incident responders may not be well-aligned with the IT infrastructure of the victim organisation; in one cited example, an incident responder required several days to patch the client’s IT systems so that it could connect to the response firm’s forensic software. Other incident responders might lack the experience that can be acquired from handling high caseloads to result in the most efficient and effective path. An incident responder concluded that they had “seen some awful, awful aftermaths of either bad breach counsel, bad PR [and] even bad recovery”. Comments such as these stressed that third parties, including incident responders, can aggravate the harm victims experience when they provide a poor service, increasing the victim’s operational downtime and potentially forcing victims to reach out to a second incident responder for an expedited resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While primarily focused on technical response and recovery, incident responders may also alleviate the harm by providing mental wellbeing support. In part, this comes through the core service provided. This may include providing rapid access to professionals who have experience with ransomware incidents and who offer reassurance to victims. Other interviewees highlighted that some incident response firms had created add-on counselling services for their clients. An incident responder suggested that roughly 20% of clients had taken up a recently formed counselling service, and they confirmed that the service had been well received. This service was “air-gapped” from the technical incident response activity and was provided by a specialist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from specialist counselling services, providing ad hoc mental wellbeing support can pose a challenge for incident providers, who are often hired for technical, rather than soft, skills. They often lack counselling qualifications. One interviewee confirmed that “in crisis management, you’re a bit of a grief counsellor”. Another interviewee described that they have worked with emotional clients who – although thankful in the end – were very angry, requiring the team of incident responders to be “on their tiptoes straight away”. This was reported as being especially the case when victims have a history of mental health difficulties. The success or failure of a business may also be closely entwined with an individual’s personal life, as with a micro-SME. In these instances, the incident responder described how they needed to shift to coaching more vulnerable individuals through an issue. In addition, they might help with writing the technical side of ICO reports, improving victims’ ability to effectively communicate to the ICO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incident responders thus play a critical role in limiting the technical harms that victims experience. However, they can also increase harm where their efforts are unsuccessful. Furthermore, hiring incident responders is often expensive, adding to the financial harm that victims experience. Such costs pose significant challenges for small companies or publicly funded organisations already working with a tight budget, such as schools or local councils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Negotiators&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interview data highlighted that contracted specialist negotiators can be a useful service that improves the experience of the victim organisation. Unlike the victim, who is likely to be in the midst of their first engagement with ransomware operatives, specialist negotiators have extensive experience of communicating with various ransomware operatives. They understand how to approach the operatives to either negotiate a lower ransom payment or acquire as much information from the operatives as possible. Conversely, direct negotiations between the victim and the attacker can introduce additional risk. A negotiator described how the “worst thing” a victim organisation can do is open discussions with the attackers at an executive level: attackers are likely to exploit this by ratcheting up pressure and insisting on demands for a high ransom. Interviewed ransomware victims noted that their contracted specialist negotiators would typically pretend to be a more junior member of the victim organisation, for example a secretary. This enabled the negotiator to feign technical ignorance and, importantly, insist that they needed to check with superiors before making any decisions or offers, potentially increasing negotiation leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a trend that may closely mirror the earlier professionalisation of traditional kidnap and ransom services, threat actors likely know they are speaking to contracted specialists, rather than the victims themselves. However, there are still positive aspects of drawing on the services of negotiators. Notwithstanding general increases in the value of demanded cyber ransoms, there are some indications that threat actors and contracted negotiators are normalising a process and dialogue that sees ransoms haggled down by an “industry standard” of roughly 40%. Contracting negotiation services may therefore lower the ransom payment and overall incident costs. A prominent public example of ransomware negotiation comes from Royal Mail, which succeeded in stalling for time through negotiations. Royal Mail seemingly used the extended timelines to obtain proof of data theft from the criminals in order to implement technical measures that enabled the return of some of its operations by bypassing the encrypted systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specialist negotiators can also provide victims with advice about the ransomware criminals: for example, whether offered decryption keys are likely to be viable, or whether operatives’ claims about deletion of exfiltrated data are credible. This provides valuable insight when a victim organisation is seriously considering making a ransom payment. Negotiators can also use their experience to identify irregularities: for example, when the normalised dialogue referred to above is not taking place. A victim described how their negotiating service noticed that their threat actors seemed inexperienced. Thanks to the services of the negotiating firm, the victim organisation was able to exploit the threat actors’ inexperience by offering a low-ball payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PR Firms and Media Relations Teams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many victims hire external PR support to ensure good communication throughout the incident and its aftermath. Some interviewees said that external communications services were helpful in guiding external communications and drafting statements. One victim described their communications service as “excellent”. Others, however, were less content. A victim in the education sector stated that the PR team engaged was not specialised in their sector and was therefore unable to comprehend the needs of a higher education customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PR firms are often primarily hired to deal with media relations. Like many engagements with other third parties, interactions with media are a double-edged sword for the victim experience, as they serve as an amplifier of good or bad communications. While some companies, particularly Norsk Hydro, were cited as organisations that benefited from wider media attention, many victims remain sceptical of media reporting and are reluctant to engage with media representatives. One external counsel even spoke about an incident where the company sought “a complete injunction against any publication of any information concerning the incident, so there could be no media reporting” to ensure there were no reputational consequences. This was regarded among interviewees as a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, it is the fear of further – reputational or other – harm that overshadows victims’ perspective on the role of media. One victim referred to a case where media coverage led to additional harm. They explained how, after the incident spread on the news, they experienced a “massive increase in … general denial of service attacks, people trying to get in the front door”. An insurance expert went as far as saying “if there’s any press interest … , that’s never good” – especially for smaller businesses not used to being in the spotlight, as was the case for an individual who had a photographer appear at their house. Further concern related to media coverage causing additional long-term harm, given that once the information is online it often remains publicly accessible long after the incident and can therefore also be read by new clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privately hired third-party service providers therefore significantly impact the victim’s experience. They are a powerful factor that can improve the victim experience if the relevant services are provided swiftly and are effective. However, if third-party service providers are unable to provide such positive impact, for example because they are inexperienced in a ransomware setting, fail to deliver adequate technical support, or provide advice that is not tailored to a victim’s specific situation, they may significantly contribute to the harm a victim experiences. Policymakers must therefore recognise the key role that private sector services play in the ransomware response and the victim experience. Initiatives setting out recommended incident-response services make it easier for victims to find a service that is more likely to provide services that lessen the harm experienced. Policymakers must also consider how ransomware victims, such as schools or councils, that often cannot afford the response services examined here or might not have cyber insurance, can have access to services that alleviate their harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;internal-and-external-communications&quot;&gt;Internal and External Communications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communications are a critical element determining the victim experience and can either alleviate or aggravate the harm that a ransomware attack causes. Of course, communication can be interrupted on a technical level during an incident, for example because email servers are down or because employees’ phone numbers are not accessible. This section does not address these practical concerns but focuses on communications from a strategic perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;External Communication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External communication is often the main concern of victim organisations, particularly how to communicate with customers or stakeholders, as well as students or parents. Interviews generally pointed to the relevance of sector-specific and context-tailored communications and victims’ reluctance to be transparent in their external communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communicating a narrative of victimhood may also have a positive impact. This was the case for a victim in the education sector whose communications team managed communications, including on open social media. There, reactions entailed “a neutral to positive sentiment”, because “people saw us as a victim, which always helps because people sympathise with victims”. Interviews also highlighted that external communication is particularly challenging for those employees who are not part of the immediate response team. While they might not have comprehensive insights themselves, they are often the ones who must communicate with clients or customers in the aftermath of the incident. One interviewee spoke of “difficult conversations people had to have with their customers when they weren’t allowed to say anything”, which they described as “very stressful”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To limit their harm, victims must strike the right balance between over- and under-communication. This is a highly context-specific task. On the one hand, a classic mistake is “over communication and not thought through communication”, both to customers as well as in fulfilment of legal notifications. This can actually make the situation worse when the victim who wants to get the message out does not understand the wider implications. Too little communication, on the other hand, can cause additional harm, as the example of the 2023 Capita ransomware attack has demonstrated, where the victim was heavily criticised for insufficient communication. Interview data included a victim in the public sector who regretted not communicating more openly with residents to explain the gravity of the situation in more detail, which in turn led to frustration from their side. Another victim described that they “were so petrified” that their ransomware attack would be disclosed to clients that they did not communicate openly, instead referring to it as a “cyber incident”. However, employees were able to correctly guess what the incident entailed. This communication strategy led to a credibility gap, according to the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Striking the balance between over- and under-communication is often difficult for victims. This is especially the case when operating with limited time to fulfil noticing requirements, or where legal advisers or PR experts are telling them to limit communications and transparency, or when they fear that sharing too much information will result in further harm. This was, for example, the case for an interviewee who described the careful consideration that was needed in communications due to stock market rules. In some instances, even government ministers have told councils not to go public with the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internal Communication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviews stressed that internal communications had an important impact on the victim’s experience. Internal communication is a key tool to keep up morale and improve the effectiveness of the response. A victim from the education sector stated that “keeping people in the loop about what’s happening was a key factor in reassuring people that we would come through it”. Interviewees pointed out that internal communication is especially relevant to ensure that those employees who are not part of the inner circle that is responding to the incident are included and aware of what is going on. Likewise, where such communication is weak, they might feel excluded. This led one victim to regret not including earlier those not directly involved, for example by giving them advance notice of when they would be involved again. An interviewee in the technology sector identified the importance of better internal communications as one of their key lessons from the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When internal communication was poor, “it affected morale very quickly”, as one victim from the professional services sector explained. For them, internal communications “were not optimal” as the organisation handled internal questions poorly. In this instance, the poor communication led to “very worried staff and eventually that became public as well”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internal communication includes communications with contracted third parties. It may also require victims to engage with other co-workers with whom they may not ordinarily work. Communicating during the incident can be difficult as it requires engagement with a wide range of stakeholders, varying in technical expertise and seniority. One victim described “flipping between different types of conversations” as “challenging”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews also addressed challenges communicating technical problems to a non-technical audience. One IT staff member in the charity sector described the difficulties that they experienced in communicating what was happening to senior management whose members lacked technical knowledge. This staff member did not want to undersell the gravity of the situation, but equally did not want to overburden the other party. They also felt there was a risk that senior management could think the IT team was incompetent based on these communications. Similar observations were also true for incident responders, who might also have to brief CEOs of large companies, people with whom they would not normally interact without months of preparation, but now had to brief under considerable pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a victim in the financial services sector felt that as boards “will only talk in money”, it was not sufficient to state that their team was performing poorly. Instead, they developed a cost model that described costs incurred – due to ill team members or the need to hire contractors or onboard new staff – to gain the board’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internal and external communications therefore have a strong influence on the victim experience. Striking the right balance between over- and under-communication can alleviate the victim’s harm; failing to do so can aggravate it. While communication strategies are highly context- and victim-specific, policymakers and practitioners must be aware of their potential impact and promote the importance of a good external and internal communication strategy. A strong internal communication strategy is particularly important as it risks being overlooked in current approaches to incident response and planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transparency-and-information-sharing&quot;&gt;Transparency and Information Sharing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of transparency and information sharing was a recurring theme throughout the interviews. The importance of getting good advice from external parties, previous victims or the public sector stood in contrast to the limited transparency and secrecy that occurs in practice. Secrecy about the incident often results from feelings of shame or fear of reputational and subsequent financial harm. However, the advice of third parties such as lawyers and PR specialists can make victims even less likely to share their experience. This is the case when they are counselled against sharing too much information as it might be used against the victim in subsequent legal proceedings. Interviewees critically discussed the role of lawyers and legal privilege in this context. While many victims confirmed they were given legal advice not to share information, some experts did not see legal privilege as stopping victims from sharing information in all circumstances. One legal expert stressed that while they cannot share information about individual clients, general comments and anonymised information can nevertheless provide valuable insights on best practice, without legal risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of transparency among victims was repeatedly raised during the research for this paper. For example, one victim reported feeling isolated during the incident after they were told not to share their experience. During the interviews, it became evident that victims found it helpful to talk about their experience, either in the interview itself or in other forums they previously explored. One victim stated that they “found it quite useful just to talk to you and other people, in a candid open approach … I found that useful, and I think it might help people”. This again links to the limited attention paid to the psychological impact and the individual’s experience of a ransomware attack in corporate cultures that provide little opportunity to process the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is not just the individual victim that would benefit from greater transparency. More information exchange among victims and potential victims is a meaningful way to share best practices. One victim described the challenging situation that they faced when they wanted to warn a colleague and friend in another education institute, so that they could block IP addresses and take other enhanced security measures. However, legal advice prohibited the victim from sharing this information. Similarly, another victim in the public sector stressed the importance of sharing their experience to raise awareness among other public sector institutions, especially to challenge over-confident assumptions that they would not be impacted by an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing information among victims offers unique insights: for example, as a reminder to others that they will make it through the incident. Victims might also provide recommendations for sector-specific best practices or be able to offer empathy on a deeper level. One victim described that they read ransomware reports prior to experiencing an attack themselves. However, it was more of an intellectual exercise, whereas after the incident, reading the reports made them “feel a lot of sympathy for the companies that are currently trying to navigate their way through these issues”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While interviewees broadly agreed that greater transparency was desirable, there was little agreement on the mechanisms to share information. Suggestions that government bodies such as the NCSC should encourage greater transparency or set up an exchange platform were met with mixed reactions. Some interviewees pointed out that any institutionalised approach would deter victims from sharing openly. There was a preference for a peer-supported group, but questions remained as to its exact structure and feasibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information sharing to enhance understanding of best practices and the desire for greater transparency among victims therefore stands in contrast to the secrecy that often surrounds ransomware attacks. While the benefits of more information sharing are clear, enabling such practices requires a forum where victims feel safe to share their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-influence-of-regulators&quot;&gt;The Influence of Regulators&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engagements with regulators have a significant impact on the victim experience. In the UK, a ransomware victim ought to report their incident to law enforcement, but they are not obliged to do so. If, however, the ransomware incident has affected personal data, the victim must report it to the ICO within 72 hours of first becoming aware of the event. The ICO safeguards data subjects who are affected by the exposure of their personal data. It is obliged to ensure that organisations – including those on whom ransomware has an impact – comply with mandatory data compliance. Framing the data subject as the victim-to-protect has important implications for interactions between the victim organisation (and its staff, who may also be data subjects), their third-party support and data regulators. This paper therefore does not provide a complete assessment of ICO activities but focuses instead on how ransomware victims perceive the ICO and its work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, a third of cyber cases reported to the ICO related to ransomware, possibly creating the most comprehensive database of UK ransomware victims. Interviewees were keen to share their experiences of engaging with the ICO during and after their ransomware incidents. Such engagement was repeatedly identified as a critical factor that aggravated the victim experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overriding complaint made about the “ICO experience” was the time taken for investigations. A range of factors determine the time taken to investigate. For example, they can include: an organisation’s ability to provide information; workloads during the Covid-19 pandemic; or funding models. In some instances, the time needed to engage with the ICO vastly exceeded almost all other remediation aspects of a ransomware event, barring data subject litigation. Another victim expressed frustration that a fresh request for information from the ICO asked “basic” questions that had already been comprehensively answered in a previous response. The engagement with the ICO was likely to last for months, but could extend to a year or more. An interviewee from an education organisation affected by ransomware noted that their case with the ICO was still ongoing two years after the incident. A legal practitioner with experience of supporting ransomware cases noted that they suspected that funding and/or staffing issues were causing this. Reporting has previously suggested that under-resourcing may be an ongoing issue, although the ICO’s annual reports highlight a significant increase in staffing from 2020/21 to 2022/23. Additionally, given that the ransomware victim experiences included in this project’s data corpus partially occur at the same time as various Covid-19 restrictions, it is possible that altered working practices contributed to some delays or the perception of delays in processing times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the suggested delay in reaching “closure” from a ransomware event was a source of frustration, stress and upset for victims. Victims referred to a “Sword of Damocles” effect: they were unsure whether the ICO was going to fine or censure them. The process of engaging with the ICO was also described as laborious. A victim from the education sector, for example, described being “bombarded” with letters and felt victimised. A response to ICO letters would beget further letters requesting detailed information from the IT team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As indicated earlier, the ICO has a mandate to investigate data compliance practices. That said, there was a significant trend: interviewees widely noted that their experience with the ICO added further harm at an already difficult time. For some, the protracted timelines made it difficult for them to move on after other aspects of the incident had already been finalised. However, it must be noted that while most experiences with the ICO were negative, some interviewees reported more positive experiences. For instance, the coordinator of an IT ransomware response at a charity organisation noted that while there was a wait for the ICO response in their case, they felt that the response was supportive and understanding. While the reports and interviews took time, they found the overall experience to be “less terrifying” than anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conduct of those reporting to the ICO may also potentially have a bearing on experiences. An IT director from the education sector noted that they proactively kept the ICO up to date on the investigation and remediation processes; they believed their transparent and forthcoming approach smoothed their engagement with the ICO and facilitated an ideal outcome. A digital forensics and incident response interviewee noted that victim organisations – or those supporting them – need to have a clear picture of what data the organisation holds and which data subjects are affected; if a written response to the ICO did not provide all the information legally required, it was likely that the exchange of letters would be lengthier. The coordinator of an IT response at a multinational engineering firm noted that they sent a courtesy email to the ICO before they notified the stock market of their incident, but that because of the nature of their incident, there was no follow-up or investigation. There were also suggestions that organisations should not rush to make a report to the ICO before they have a clear understanding of what has occurred, and that ideally they should seek guidance from an experienced external counsel before making a submission. A legal practitioner noted that, despite their guidance, it was not uncommon for stakeholders at a client victim organisation to “panic overnight” in the first day or two of an incident and clumsily report to the ICO, causing additional avoidable pain in the ensuing months. This is a tricky balancing act, particularly given the 72-hour deadline for notifying the ICO following awareness of a breach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it should be emphasised that the ICO has an important role in protecting the data rights of UK data subjects. Where a ransomware event impacts data subjects, they too are victims of the ransomware. Interviewees noted that the ICO was a necessary part of the UK’s regulatory system and that it was right that it should follow due process and work to drive positive transparency in organisations. Ultimately, the data corpus indicated that there is a balance that should be struck between empathising with organisations that receive a ransom note as victims of serious international organised crime and using regulatory pressure to encourage the adoption of stringent personal data-protection practices. While the purpose of the ICO may be apt, changes that can improve the victim experience may be possible. Those that can, wherever possible, reduce the prolonged stress and uncertainty are especially important. Victims also should not need to resubmit identical evidence or information when a prior comprehensive reply has already taken place. At the same time, victim organisations should be advised that they can submit a brief initial report within the 72-hour limit, and therefore avoid submitting a more detailed report in haste during the opening phase of an extremely stressful crisis situation. Here, the support of experienced external counsel may be particularly useful to coordinate a measured or cautious initial submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-the-role-of-government-the-ncsc-and-law-enforcement&quot;&gt;III. The Role of Government, the NCSC and Law Enforcement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter sets out the role of the public sector support and engagement network ecosystem. Findings are based on interview discussions on the support victims receive from local police, regional organised crime units (ROCUs), the NCSC and the NCA, as well as the engagements victims have with the ICO. The analysis does not cover the capacity of government and law enforcement bodies to bring ransomware operators to justice. Rather, it draws insights on the nature, scale and impact of public sector support for ransomware victims. Specifically, the focus is on the degree to which this support ecosystem improves and/or exacerbates a victim’s experiences during a ransomware incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BR1dadI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: Types of Support Provided to Ransomware Victims, by Organisation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;types-of-support&quot;&gt;Types of Support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police, NCA, NCSC and ICO may support ransomware victims in a variety of ways. Table 3 provides an indicative list of support categories. Note, pre- and post-breach notifications may most commonly relate to “Protect” notifications that law enforcement may issue to organisations after receiving intelligence about a current or likely breach. “Passive” crisis management support refers to activity such as sitting in on teleconference calls between victim personnel and colleagues from their third-party incident response firm. Conversely, “active” crisis management refers to on-the-ground remediation support, which may include technical remediation of affected systems. As highlighted in the next section, active crisis management is less commonly provided than its passive equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-ncsc-and-law-enforcement-support-is-allocated&quot;&gt;How NCSC and Law Enforcement Support is Allocated&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interview data highlighted that the makeup of the support ecosystem is likely to vary depending on the context of an individual victim. The NCSC’s cyber incident framework provides an indication, ranging from Category 1 (national cyber emergency) to Category 6 (localised incident). A direct victim experiencing a Category 6 incident is likely to find that their incident is supported by local police. At Category 4 or above, the NCSC may become involved, with a greater likelihood of NCSC coordination/lead at Category 3 and above. As the incident framework articulates, the assessment is, in part, driven by the likely impact of an incident on societal or governmental functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle, an SME providing a vital service that experienced a disruptive ransomware incident could therefore receive NCSC support. There is a degree of fluidity with the support ecosystem, but this equally leads to a sense of uncertainty as to who can expect NCSC support and under what circumstances. A ransomware victim may find that the level of support aligns with, exceeds or does not meet their expectations. An incident responder described their view that UK law enforcement was “more hands off … [they’re] advising and taking details, and then waiting for the victim to provide additional information at a suitable time”. In some limited cases, victims may be able to draw on NCSC/GCHQ technical remediation support, although this service is constrained by resource availability. A government interviewee described how they were not resourced to compete with the private sector, noting that “[Microsoft, Google, Mandiant,] the budgets of these organisations outweigh anything I’ve got … [our] challenge is to work out how to … sit alongside and complement appropriately what exists out there … we need to be realistic. The national resource is targeted at nationally significant incidents”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The law enforcement engagement during a typical ransomware victim experience is likely to start with a submission to Action Fraud. Victims who call the national emergency number will probably be redirected to Action Fraud, unless they are particularly high profile. The victim enters text describing the nature of their incident into the Action Fraud submission page. From here, the case is reviewed and triaged; an SME, for example, may be supported by local police, whereas a larger organisation with a regional significance, such as a large university, may be supported by a regional organised crime unit (ROCU). It is also possible for some organisations to be directed to the police after being in contact with the NCA. The victim of ransomware can anticipate that the local or regional police will gather data about the incident, in part to support a regional or national profile of cybercrime trends. The victim may also receive support from law enforcement sources, for example guidance on external communications with stakeholders, or suggestions regarding post-incident “aftercare”, such as vulnerability assessments or cyber exercises. Figure 4 summarises the interactions that are possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processes are not, however, uniform and victim experiences may vary significantly even within a single jurisdiction such as England. On paper, while most victims should contact Action Fraud as a first port of call, there are circumstances where this step may be bypassed. A supplier of critical national infrastructure (CNI), for instance, could bypass Action Fraud altogether and instead report directly to the NCSC. It is also possible that the NCSC and the NCA may draw on intelligence to proactively reach out to a high-significance victim that has avoided reporting their incident. The length of time during which a ransomware victim can expect to liaise with law enforcement can also vary significantly, ranging from weeks to months. It is also worth noting that victims of ransomware may also avoid engagement with the NCSC or law enforcement altogether. All ransomware victims interviewed for this project had engaged with law enforcement in some way. This may reflect the bias of voluntary participation research; individuals who were willing to share their experiences with the research team may be more likely to engage with law enforcement. However, wider reporting suggests several reasons for avoiding law enforcement engagement. These include perceived reputational risks and the fear that law enforcement forensics may interfere with a restoration effort. Additionally, victims may fear that law enforcement, once involved, might find other things of interest beyond the ransomware incident to which they do not want to draw attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/r8mfXs0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: How UK Ransomware Victims Interact with Public Bodies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the sensitivity of a ransomware incident and the desire to control external communications, victims may fear that engagement with law enforcement might increase possible negative exposure. This might include, for example, details of the incident appearing in the press. Additionally, the pressure to restore business operations and move on from the incident means that victims may be concerned that law enforcement agencies will want to take copies of impacted sections of an IT estate for forensic investigation, possibly stalling recovery efforts. This latter point – investigation versus recovery – is a potentially important area of contention. The interests of the individual victim organisation (an effective recovery as soon as possible) may run counter to the interests of wider society (understanding the nature of the ransomware threat). Counter-ransomware successes such as the February 2024 NCA-led takedown operation against LockBit benefit from maximum access to intelligence within the UK and among international law enforcement partners. Furthermore, counter-ransomware initiatives may also stem a ransomware group’s activity and thereby reduce future harm. Existing and new victims may also benefit from seized decryption keys being shared by law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-impact-of-police-support-perspectives-from-victims-and-stakeholders&quot;&gt;The Impact of Police Support: Perspectives from Victims and Stakeholders&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M any interviewees were keen to share their experiences of their interactions with law enforcement services during and after their ransomware incident. Given the nature of the distribution of response – with the NCSC liaising with select cases – victims were much more likely to have experience of dealing with local or regional police. This section draws on insights from victims’ assessments of the efficacy of police in dealing with ransomware incidents. The analysis also draws on the perspectives of stakeholders from the ransomware support ecosystem, such as incident responders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Findings in this section need to be seen in their appropriate context: law enforcement services operate with limited resources, and ransomware victims are likely to be under severe stress during their incidents. With these circumstances in mind, the findings are nevertheless useful for policymakers and law enforcement stakeholders. For example, it may be possible to identify areas where tweaks to law enforcement practices for ransomware incidents may have a substantial positive effect on the typical victim experience. While it may not be possible to bring perpetrators to swift justice, law enforcement plays an important role as a public sector support system for victims, and as a collator of regional and national data on the ransomware threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the data corpus, negative perceptions about the role of law enforcement were widespread. A victim from a large multinational firm in the engineering sector noted that they “didn’t see the point” of reporting to law enforcement, citing the lack of a valuable return, during a crisis, and the concern that the police would request data for forensics investigations. Nonetheless, they were quick to add that they had proactively given intelligence to the NCSC and the NCA. A victim from a law firm recalled how they spoke with a cyber specialist from the police who appeared knowledgeable and initially suggested that help may be available to restore systems, but this help did not materialise after a follow-up and the victim was left with the perception that they were on “their own”. The victim cited their cyber insurance as the most valuable source of support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The director of a micro-SME compared two cases of police engagement: one on the ransomware attack against their business; and the other on the theft of their car. Within days, the car was identified and retrieved by police before it could leave the UK for illicit international resale; but no support was forthcoming for the ransomware incident. Multiple victims from the technology sector relayed their view that the police were ill-equipped and/or unable to support them during their incidents. One noted that, from their particular experience, they were left feeling that the police were not familiar with the terms “IP address” or “VPN”, indicating a significant lack of expertise. The policing “skills and resourcing gap” between analogue and digital crime response capability featured prominently in a recent report by the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy. Additionally, an inspection report had previously identified that ROCUs were competing with one another for a limited pool of skilled personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees highlighted that, in some instances, the creation of a crime number may be the extent of police engagement or support. While some victims will receive a visit from the police, others will not. Some victims may not receive any follow-up. More generally, it was notable that there is a degree of inconsistency in law enforcement’s engagement with ransomware victims. Concerningly, there were indications of a “postcode lottery”. While caveating that their experience may be anecdotal, an incident responder described how: “if you are based near Leicester and you report to Action Fraud, it’s going to make it to [the] NCA and they are then going to speak to the local constabulary and you’re actually going to get some kind of support. But if you’re somewhere else, it’s way less likely”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not all experiences were negative. A victim from the education sector described their police cyber unit as “super supportive … they were excellent, absolutely excellent”. An external counsel interviewee noted that while there continued to be a lack of understanding about the nature of the ransomware victim experience – and the needs of an organisation that has been affected by ransomware – there was an increasing “uptick” in interest among victims to report incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-existing expectations were a critical factor when assessing law enforcement’s support. If a victim’s expectations were low, they were less likely to be disappointed when significant support was not forthcoming. This speaks to an important point: evaluations of the “efficacy” of law enforcement’s engagement with ransomware victims will depend on their understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the police in dealing with international cybercrime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given limited resources, the police cannot serve as public sector incident response for ransomware. Interviews emphasised that the incident response ecosystem is almost entirely run by the private sector. However, the data corpus also highlighted a growing role of the UK police as a collector and disseminator of intelligence about ransomware threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of police in ransomware response is, however, not necessarily clear to victims. As law enforcement’s ransomware threat landscape purview develops, there may be more opportunities to clarify the role and contributions of law enforcement. One way to do so is by reinforcing a positive feedback loop. An incident responder described how their perception had changed; previously, they saw the benefit of client engagement with law enforcement as “zero”, but their view was changing after law enforcement had proactively reached out to some clients to let them know that their IT estate was being maliciously accessed by threat actors. Unfortunately, this occurred after the ransomware payload had already been delivered, but the responder viewed the proactive contact with clients as a positive reinforcement for encouraging future client reporting to law enforcement. A similar experience was shared by an external counsel interviewee, who noted that while most engagements with law enforcement were “intelligence gathering” exercises, they had personal experience of a “handful” of cases where the police joined calls and provided updates on the victim’s data exfiltration, drawing on dark-web monitoring. This was regarded by the external counsel as a very helpful development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A law enforcement practitioner noted that, from their experience, ransomware victims typically reported because they “feel like they should”, rather than doing so out of anticipation of in-person support. Another interviewee – a legal practitioner with experience of supporting ransomware victims – highlighted a sense of pragmatism in their approach to engaging with law enforcement. They noted that while they were cautious about the level of information that they would share, there had never been “any detriment” to their engagement with law enforcement and that they were collectively united in the interest of fighting against ransomware. They suggested there were “myths” about the role of law enforcement that may be unhelpfully distorting perceptions of what help is or is not available. A positive feedback loop – in cases where victims have previously shared information with law enforcement – would therefore have an impact by showing victims how such information was used and how it contributed to successful law enforcement activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data suggests that context affects whether the extent of law enforcement engagement can aggravate or reduce the negative experiences of ransomware victims. A range of factors may influence this, including the nature of the victim organisation, its location (including at a county level) and the victim’s expectations. While some victims may welcome an arm’s-length response from law enforcement, others may want more active support, even if this is only an empathetic ear during a time of crisis. This reinforces the utility of an initial phone call or site visit from law enforcement, which can be used to understand a victim’s needs and provide clarity about expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-impact-of-ncsc-and-nca-support-perspectives-from-victims-and-stakeholders&quot;&gt;The Impact of NCSC and NCA Support: Perspectives from Victims and Stakeholders&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees were also keen to share their perspectives on the perceived efficacy of the NCSC and the NCA in relation to the ransomware victim experience. The functions of the NCSC and the NCA are distinct. However, an interesting finding from the data corpus was that victims reported similarities in their experiences of engaging with the two bodies. It was reported that both agencies had roles in background coordination or oversight in certain ransomware incidents. Some ransomware cases drew the support of one agency while others triggered the involvement of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On paper, the incident response framework referred to earlier in this paper partially clarifies the trigger points for NCSC and/or NCA involvement: for example, an incident in Categories 1–4 is likely to warrant some form of NCSC involvement. In practice, however, there was confusion about whether a victim can anticipate NCSC or NCA involvement and the degree of support that may be offered. A government workshop participant indicated that this may be intentional: “if I’m honest, we have used … a degree of ambiguity, and didn’t want to be overly prescriptive on who we wouldn’t support. Which I totally get can be frustrating, but … the desire on our side was to ensure that nobody ruled themselves out in coming forward”. Sensitivity about supply chains means that exceptions, caveats and reactivity were important in determining who can access higher levels of government support. For example, even when a victim is technically not part of CNI, their unique and important position in a supply chain might warrant NCSC or NCA support, as the impacts may be similar. Flexibility in how cases are triaged is necessary to manage limited resources and capacity. In the National Security Strategy Joint Committee report, it was recommended that the NCSC and the NCA be sufficiently funded to provide full-recovery support for all public sector ransomware victims. However, there may be some apprehension about providing the funding necessary for this level of service, particularly given the costs of competing with private sector incident response salaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some incident responders work with the NCSC and/or the NCA on almost all their cases due to the size of their typical clients. However, other interviewees reported frustration with the ambiguity surrounding the involvement of the two agencies. They urged that more clarity be provided on the circumstances in which the NCSC in particular becomes involved. Again, expectations on the timeline and level of support were important factors. An interviewee from a government body (with a significant societal purview) described how they informed central government immediately after the ransomware took effect, but did not get a response for seven days and brought on board private support. After this time had elapsed and public pressure mounted, NCSC personnel came on-site and worked 12-hour shifts alongside the organisation’s IT staff. As a further indication of inconsistent practices, another government body with a significant societal purview received “boots-on-the-ground” support from the NCA and a large incident response firm, with regular calls also including the NCSC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A victim from the technology sector noted that their initial impression after engaging with law enforcement was that the NCA would “own” the coordination of their response throughout the incident, but that, possibly due to resourcing constraints,– the response was, in effect, passed to the local police force. The victim expressed frustration on two fronts: first, the lack of engagement; and second, the lack of clarity about why the NCA withdrew from the case. It was also noted that information sharing with the NCSC and the NCA can feel like a “one-way street”, where agencies absorb threat and incident intelligence but infrequently share feedback or their own intelligence. The NCSC has also been described as “tactically focused”: predominantly interested in the core incident. A victim who kept the NCSC abreast of their incident remediation and shared intelligence thought that it would have been useful for an NCSC representative to have spoken with members of their executive group after the incident. According to them, this would have helped to relay the seriousness of the event to the business’s decision-makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More positively, both the NCSC and the NCA were reported to be “trusted parties” when engaging with victims; victims can approach either body without fear that the government body would share information with the ICO or leak information to the press. An interviewee from a victim organisation that has a CNI-related purview spoke highly of the NCSC’s role as a trusted coordinating authority and found their role as a single point of contact to be useful. Both the NCA and the NCSC were also able, in some circumstances, to discreetly liaise with international law enforcement to arrange for the takedown of exfiltrated data. The February 2024 NCA-led operation that successfully seized LockBit servers included exfiltrated data (including data from those who had paid ransoms for deletion of exfiltrated data) and more than 1,000 decryption keys earmarked for victims. This publicly announced hack-back was internationally acclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, some interviewees specifically appreciated the laissez-faire nature of NCSC engagement, believing that the victim’s own IT team and hired expertise were best placed to remediate the ransomware incident and achieve the best outcomes for the organisation. In part, this approach is pragmatic: the NCSC’s incident management team is small, and the agency is not able to compete with the private sector, both in terms of capacity and salaries offered to its staff. It was also suggested that as the NCSC is the public-facing element of a signals intelligence agency, it may not be particularly well placed to serve as an emergency service for most incidents. Ultimately, while the NCSC may serve as an actor-of-last-resort in select cases, it cannot take on this function for many victims. Instead, the NCSC was framed as a source of information and guidance for organisations. It offers a wide range of guidance that organisations can draw on, before and after an incident. This guidance generally received praise from interviewees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, the data indicates that, broadly, the NCSC and the NCA have built reputations as trusted partners in coordinating ransomware incidents, particularly those that have a significant societal impact. Interviewees were also generally understanding of the resource constraints that the NCSC and the NCA face and that their active involvement in an incident remediation process must be rationed. This may temper expectations. There were, however, notable exceptions. Some victims felt that they should have received more active government support during their incident. This was particularly prominent in the education sector, which is not included in the UK government’s list of 13 CNI sectors. This may reflect a grey area between organisations that feel that they have a societally significant role, but which, according to the data, may not qualify for support. At the same time, ambiguity from the NCSC and the NCA may serve a useful purpose. How these considerations are balanced should be guided by the goal of minimising harms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in this chapter, the influence of law enforcement on the victim experience reflects the fact that the enforcement “lag” is incorporated. There are significant structural and judicial impediments to law enforcement’s capacity to bring most ransomware operators to justice. However, law enforcement and regulators can play a role in either alleviating or exacerbating the ransomware victim experience. This chapter has identified a range of practices that can either improve or worsen the victim experience across the full timeline of a ransomware incident. This analysis recognises key nuances and the important role of the wider context. However, the analysis also highlighted important areas of divergence in support between, for example, different police forces. The NCSC’s informal policy of remaining ambiguous about the circumstances that attract its involvement may warrant refinement over time. Additionally, expectation management, clarity of communication and the use of feedback loops appear to be common underlying challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware incidents are deliberately designed to be high-impact events for victim organisations and their personnel. The criminals who code and deploy ransomware seek to cause calibrated harm – or the threat of imminent future harm – against their victims to encourage the payment of a ransom. Whether an attack comes in the form of an encryption or exfiltration event, or both, the attackers exploit an organisation’s reliance on its data and data systems. While a ransomware event is invariably a negative experience for victims, a range of factors can make it relatively “better” or “worse”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on original semi-structured interviews with ransomware victims and expert stakeholders who work with ransomware victims, this paper has identified a range of factors that can influence how harms are experienced. These include factors that are internal to the organisation, such as the level of preparedness and the organisational culture before and after the incident, as well as decisions that are made during the crisis and recovery phases. The overall influencing factors also include those that are external to the organisation, for example, the behaviour of the ransomware threat actors. As the paper has identified, additional external factors include the role(s) performed by third parties such as incident response services, lawyers and public entities (including law enforcement and regulators).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, prevention of the incident is the optimal outcome. However, ransomware is very prevalent and can have a severe impact for any organisation. It is, therefore, necessary to also focus on “resilience”: the ability to reduce impact and maximise recovery after a breach. This paper’s analysis of the internal and external factors may be used to inform ongoing efforts to increase organisational resilience against ransomware breaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on the analysis and findings, the paper proposes a range of cross-stakeholder recommendations that are based on the combined findings of this paper and an earlier RUSI paper on ransomware harms. That paper categorised first-, second- and third-order harms from ransomware incidents. This paper draws on the same original interview and workshop data corpus that informed the first paper. These recommendations focus on ways to alleviate the victim’s harm. To acknowledge the range of actors who can take measures to mitigate victims’ harms, these recommendations provide suggestions to victim organisations, third-party service providers and policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-for-victims-and-victim-organisations&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Victims and Victim Organisations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1: (Potential) victims, including those who do not think they will become a victim of a ransomware attack, must continue to improve cyber-specific incident preparation and general cyber hygiene measures.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All organisations must consider themselves potential victims of ransomware attacks and must therefore continue to improve their cyber security and cyber hygiene measures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Despite continued awareness campaigns, cyber security is still, all too often, a low priority for many organisations. This is especially the case for public service providers such as schools, and small and micro-businesses. The interview data has shown that good cyber hygiene and cyber security measures can significantly alleviate the harm victims experience. These include good data hygiene and an awareness that any organisation can become the victim of a ransomware attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Organisations should develop cyber-specific contingency plans to prepare for a potential attack and run simulations of cyber incidents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The interview data has further confirmed that while some organisations have contingency plans, they are largely irrelevant or unsuitable if they are not cyber specific. Cyber-specific incident preparation can also include running exercises simulating a ransomware or other cyber incident.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2: (Potential) victims who are preparing for and responding to a ransomware incident must recognise the importance of mitigating the psychological impact of ransomware attacks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychological impacts affect victims in various ways. They are often overlooked, both in the public discourse and among organisations that fall victim to a ransomware attack. Underlying health conditions and the exact role an individual plays within an organisation’s ransomware response can significantly influence their exposure to harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When preparing for an incident, organisations and cyber security professionals must identify and implement measures to mitigate the psychological impact on individuals directly or indirectly affected by the ransomware attack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This includes “soft” measures such as normalising discussions about the impact of workload and stress on mental health, as well as cultivating a supportive workplace culture. It also includes specific plans such as budgeting for mental health support and creating rotating schedules and a division of labour to avoid over-reliance on select individuals. Preparation must also view ransomware response as a marathon, not a sprint, and resources must be allocated carefully. Understandably, even with preparation, victim organisations may not necessarily be accustomed to the toll of ransomware incidents. Here, experienced external support can be instructive. Stakeholders in the incident response ecosystem can proactively offer bespoke pastoral support to personnel at victim organisations. As highlighted in this paper, there is anecdotal evidence that some incident response firms are offering a separate confidential service to clients to meet this need.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;During incident response, measures must be taken to avoid burnout and systematic overwork of individuals. Offering opportunities for victims to talk about their experience can further mitigate the impact of psychological harm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Line managers should be sensitive to colleagues’ workloads and the psychological, physical and other harm the ransomware attack has on both the organisation and its staff members. While a ransomware incident will always remain an exceptionally stressful period for a victim organisation, flexibility is required to adjust to staff members’ mental health. Special attention needs to be paid to members of core IT teams, whose pivotal role in the technical elements of the initial remediation and the workload (and responsibility) they have during the incident exposes them to aggravating factors. This is set out in greater detail in the first of RUSI’s two papers. When over-reliance is unavoidable, annual leave or discretionary time off should be considered, once an immediate crisis period ends. A victim organisation can further offer counselling or therapy for affected staff or, at the minimum, an informal place to talk about their experience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When reflecting on the lessons learned after an incident, senior management must acknowledge the personal implications of the ransomware attack and should communicate this within their organisations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Staff members are aware that a ransomware incident is a moment of crisis and, as such, any response has its flaws. However, several interviewees indicated that they were not looking to senior management for silver-bullet solutions. Instead, they wanted an acknowledgement of the personal implications that the ransomware attack had for them. For example, one internal report mentioned during the interviews included a post-incident analysis that focused on the financial impact the ransomware attack had on the organisation. It did not, however, speak of the personal toll it caused and the personal dedication and sacrifices it demanded of employees responding to the attack. Acknowledgment of how personally the attack is felt by staff members is a relatively easy, but meaningful, step that senior management and line managers can take to mitigate frustration and ensure good morale among their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3: Victims should try to turn their experience into a lesson learned for others and, where possible, communicate with other victims or potential victims in their ecosystem. This can help with personal closure and to raise awareness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper confirms that, for many victims, a ransomware incident is a stressful and potentially dark period in their life, making it hard to talk about their experience. However, the data has also demonstrated the value of talking about the experience, whether it is for personal closure or to provide critical insights to members of their ecosystem and sector to help them better prepare for a ransomware attack. Close communication with lawyers, PR advisers and senior management can help victims gain confidence in making decisions on the kind of information they can share. Victims can also signal their willingness to engage with other victims to their third-party service providers. This would allow such providers to act as networkers for those victims in the midst of a ransomware incident so that they gain the benefit of previous victims’ insights. Finally, regional or sectoral organisations, such as business associations, can offer platforms for victims to meaningfully connect or speak to their peers, providing valuable insights and contributing to raising awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 4: Victims should realise the importance of reaching the right balance of discretion and transparency within their external and internal communications.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper has demonstrated how the right amount of communication and transparency can have a positive impact on the victim experience. It has also underlined that ransomware attacks occur in unique circumstances and that their impact has substantial personal impact. Given the features of each case, it is not possible to provide general advice for victims on how to run their (external) communications during and after a ransomware attack. A victim’s external communication strategy is a highly context-dependent balancing act that seeks to avoid both under- and over-communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the research has clearly stressed the importance of an internal communication strategy. Many victims, however, prioritise or only focus on external communication strategies. To retain morale within the affected organisation and to ensure that the staff members not directly working on the ransomware response do not feel left out, victims should establish regular and transparent communication with the wider organisation. This includes a recognition of the personal toll the ransomware incident has for many staff members (see above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-for-private-sector-service-providers&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Private Sector Service Providers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 5: Third-party service providers must recognise the importance of efforts that mitigate the psychological impact of ransomware attacks and these must form part of their technical, legal or other services to improve victims’ experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third-party service providers must understand the central role of psychological harm in the victim experience and adjust their performance to consider the individual and psychological needs of a victim.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Third-party service providers, such as incident responders and lawyers, offer highly specialised support to victims. While they may excel in their respective disciplines, they are often insufficiently trained in navigating communications with victims going through such a stressful incident for the first time. Organisations offering these services should provide training for their staff on how to offer both professional services as well as communicate in a considerate way to victims.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber insurance policies should provide coverage for mental health counselling during and after incidents, and insurers should add recommended counselling services to their panels of pre-approved vendors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Third-party service providers cannot and should not be expected to offer counselling that goes beyond their professional obligations or capability. Instead, service providers such as incident responders should consider recruiting specific staff for their soft social skills, possibly including bespoke counselling staff, therapists, councillors and social workers who can support victims in additional ways.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 6: With the consent of the clients, third-party service providers should actively enable information sharing between past, current and potential victims through their networks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third-party service providers should use their networks to actively encourage victims to share their experience with current and potential victims.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Third-party service providers see a large number of ransomware incidents unfold. This makes them highly experienced and puts them in a great position to network between past, current and potential victims. However, it can also mean that what might seem like a uniquely challenging situation to a first-time victim might be the bread and butter of a third-party service provider. Such providers should therefore encourage current and potential victims to talk to former victims who can offer peer insights from the perspective of someone who has gone through similar situations, providing empathetic and tailored support. This is a unique perspective that third-party service providers cannot offer: while they might have worked on many cases, they typically have not been a victim themselves. The research for this paper indicates that many members of the ransomware ecosystem rated these informal transparency and information sharing measures as highly impactful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When providing advice to victims on the degree of information sharing they can conduct, third-party service providers should not just take into account the interests of the victim organisation, such as mitigating legal or reputational risks. Instead, they should balance them against the psychological impacts on victims that might occur by preventing transparency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are instances when service providers have good reasons to advise a victim to restrict their information sharing or the degree of transparency in communications about their situation to external parties. However, interviews have illuminated that such advice might drive victims into isolation even though they often benefit from sharing their experience. Assessments of third-party service providers differed on whether restricting information sharing – and to what extent – is necessary, with some pointing out that general information sharing is not a problem from a legal perspective. Third-party service providers should therefore carefully balance their advice given to victims on restricting information sharing, taking into account not just the interests of the victim organisation as a whole (such as reputational or legal risks) but also the impact such advice can have on affected staff members and their mental wellbeing. A constructive approach finding a context-specific, carefully balanced solution is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-for-policymakers-and-public-institutions&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Policymakers and Public Institutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 7: Public policy on ransomware must centre on measures that mitigate victims’ harm. This includes acknowledging and mitigating the psychological impact on victims.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any guidance that is shared on how to prepare for, manage and respond to a ransomware attack must include best practices for mitigating the psychological harm, such as managing burnout and stress, as well as offering counselling services where appropriate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The NCSC’s guidance on incident management or identifying relevant teams and roles supporting incident management, for example, do not include specific reference to softer measures to be taken to improve the victim’s experience and mitigate psychological impact. The NCSC has targeted guidance on “putting staff welfare at the heart of incident response”. However, greater value is achieved when mental health considerations are woven into guidance on preparation and incident-response plans at all levels. This would serve an important function in protecting IT teams and incident responders from adverse mental health impacts, as well as promote awareness and/or recognition from the board and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More public funding is needed for further free mental health services, including therapy tailored to individuals affected by ransomware.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While some public funding for counselling and therapy is already available, long waiting lists for mental health support indicate that demand is significantly higher than supply. The Action Fraud website refers to victim support provided by the charity Victim Support, primarily funded by the Police and Crime Commissioners, which now includes specific guidance for cybercrime victims and freely provides victim support tools and services, such as helplines and online tools and practices. Enquiries further found that the way to access victim support remained unclear and that gaps in its provision led to “loss of trust between victims and the systems in place”. While these findings related to fraud, the authors have found that they are also true for a ransomware context.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 8: Public guidance to prepare and respond to an incident is already available and helpful, but must be easier to filter, including for quality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Improve search functions of the NCSC list of guides.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Increased awareness, further research and wider coverage of ransomware incidents over the past few years has led to an extensive, yet decentralised, repository of publicly available information, for example in the form of statistics and advice on best practices. This is generally laudable, especially when sources provide practical information that is widely and freely available. There is now a need to filter this information in a central dataset. While many interviewees were aware of the NCSC’s guidance and commended its utility for ransomware preparedness and recovery, interviewees also found that it is generally difficult to filter for relevant information online, including within the NCSC repository of guides. For example, it might be more intuitive for victims to filter information according to “before”, “during” and “after” the incident than it may be to filter for certain authors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Establish a “Guide of Guides”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Interviewees and workshop participants discussed the option of a “guide of guides” as a centralised repository including both NCSC-approved and NCSC-issued information. This would allow users to rely on a wider range of sources and to filter relevant information, for example, according to sector-specific advice. A “guide of guides” would also filter advice in advance of an attack, during an incident or on the ransomware landscape more generally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 9: Policymakers need to encourage transparency and information exchange by setting up informal safe space forums.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite awareness campaigns about reporting incidents and information sharing, a lack of exchange and transparency still dominates the victim experience. This is highly regrettable, not just from a data-gathering perspective. Further transparency could not only improve statistics and insights into ransomware attacks but also improve the victim experience. When victims share their experience, potential victims can learn from their best practices and avoid their mistakes. Additionally, victims may also feel less isolated and may mentally benefit from sharing the information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a well-connected entity, the NCSC must continue to act as an informal networker between past and potential victims and must encourage transparency and information sharing among a wide range of stakeholders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In practice, victims are not incentivised to be transparent. This is especially the case in official or highly formal channels, as concerns over reputational harm or legal consequences outweigh the incentives to openly contribute to knowledge exchange. To counter these concerns, policymakers should encourage informal safe spaces where victims can anonymously share threat intelligence, best practices and other advice. The status of the NCSC as a “trusted partner” may support it as a coordinator of feed-forward forums.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greater promotion and expansion of NCSC trust groups is needed, and greater informality should be encouraged.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While some trust groups for specific sectors are already convened under the NCSC, victims were largely unaware of them. Furthermore, it is challenging for policymakers to encourage informal transparency as efforts will likely be seen as formal places for information sharing, making victims fear that any information may be leaked or used against them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 10: Establish a positive feedback loop that shares success stories and notifies victims where the information they shared is successfully used for intelligence and law enforcement activities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase transparency and reporting to the NCSC and law enforcement, policymakers should also focus on developing a positive feedback loop with victims that report. This should include sharing success stories of law enforcement activity directly with victims to illustrate their contributions. For example, where a victim organisation has contributed data that leads to a successful arrest, reclamation of ransom payments or prevention of further ransomware breaches against other organisations, this should be shared with the organisation in question to provide closure and endorsement, notwithstanding necessary redactions or anonymisation. Equally, where law enforcement and other public agencies manage to successfully disrupt cybercriminals, greater publicity of these success stories would further encourage support and enhance the reputation of law enforcement, generating further support and trust from wider society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 11: Government authorities need to clarify the tasks of relevant public institutions and their role in the ransomware response.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The NCSC should provide more clarity on when and how it can support victims.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The ransomware response ecosystem is complex and involves many actors from the public and private sectors. However, the interview data illustrated that such engagement is often challenging for victims, who are uncertain where to turn for assistance, to which organisations they should report incidents and what support they can expect from authorities, and how they interact with one another. Duplication of efforts when engaging with authorities often comes at a time of extreme stress for victims, who have little incentive to engage with authorities when they do not expect anything in return. Greater transparency on the relevant actors, the support they provide and coordination among different authorities would streamline communication efforts, manage expectations for engagements and, ultimately, encourage victims to report and provide information to public authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additionally, the NCSC may consider providing tangible (if hypothetical) examples about differing organisations in various ransomware or cyber breach scenarios, identifying which ones would receive what support, and why.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While the public perception of the NCSC’s coordination role on ransomware is generally positive, the lack of transparency on the trigger points for NCSC support was criticised. Some ambiguity about the NCSC’s exact involvement may be desirable to maintain the flexibility to adjust to certain incidents or allocate resources more freely. But such ambiguity must be balanced against the need for expectation management and to avoid reputational damage to the NCSC. It is particularly important for the NCSC to set out its role in incident response and what it considers when deciding on whether to get involved in a given incident either directly or as a coordinator. Furthermore, victims require clarification on what kind of support they can expect from the NCSC. Better expectation management in relation to victims and the wider public ensures credibility of the NCSC and encourages victims to report their ransomware incident.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 12: Police must assume their important role as an accessible face of authority in the ransomware response ecosystem, even where their ability to act is limited.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lack of resources and training currently makes local police units ill-equipped to contribute to responses. While it is unrealistic to expect law enforcement to provide emergency service technical response, it is nonetheless the case that local or regional police units provide the face of public authority for victims of ransomware. The experience, detailed earlier in this paper, of the micro-business director whose vehicle was stolen after their ransomware incident, was telling. The exceedingly efficient response to the “analogue” or traditional crime was juxtaposed starkly against the immaterial response to the ransomware incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Victims of a serious ransomware breach must be offered telephone and/or on-site contact from a law enforcement body within a reasonable timeframe of the victim’s initial report to Action Fraud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The interview and workshop data highlighted a wide disparity in the experience of ransomware victims, with indications that there may be a de facto “postcode lottery”. In some instances, ransomware victims have seemingly been given a disservice: for instance, when they reported a ransomware incident through Action Fraud but were never contacted by police. Arguably, all genuine ransomware cases should prompt a call and/or offer of a site visit from the police. The ransomware victims interviewed for this project felt – passionately – that they were undeserved victims of serious transnational organised crime. Additional distress was often caused by the fact that the attackers were perceived as remote and “faceless”. Local or regional police do not need to be faceless. When offered, a perceptible presence or gesture from local or regional police provides victims with a form of recognition of the crime that they have experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is not only about public relations; it is an important step in improving the feedback loop. Whether the initial contact with police is positive or negative has an important bearing on the likelihood that a victim engages further with local or regional police during and after an incident. Ongoing or intermittent engagement enables greater opportunities for information to flow in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 13: The ICO should continue to work towards timely assessments of ransomware breaches to avoid further harm to victims.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent “long-tail” negative experiences cited by ransomware victims was their ongoing engagement with the ICO. Victims routinely engaged in an ongoing exchange of letters with the ICO for months or years after the core elements of their ransomware recovery were complete. As previously noted, the ICO provides a vital service in overseeing compliance with data protection regulations, with a focus on protection of individuals’ personal data. Given the potential scale and depth of data exposure implicated by a ransomware event, it is important that the ICO scrutinises organisations. However, there may be a balance to be struck between the promotion of regulatory compliance and exacerbating a (possible) crisis situation for the ransomed organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The resourcing of the ICO should continue to be assessed, to maximise the efficient triage, assessment and completion of investigations, enabling timely closure and/ or accountability for organisations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The authors of this paper do not determine where this balance lies. However, organisations that were victims of ransomware spoke firmly of their negative experiences of engagement with the ICO. Given that the ICO follows a mandate outlined in legislation, this suggests that legislators may want to reflect on whether the ICO’s approach to censuring victims of cybercrime strikes the correct balance. Additionally, the data corpus highlighted instances when stress was unnecessarily and avoidably exacerbated for ransomware victims. This was the case for a victim who was asked questions that had already been comprehensively responded to in a previous written response. If staffing or process issues contribute to such errors, stakeholders may need to consider whether the funding arrangements for the ICO are adequate to meet its task. It should be noted that the ICO has acknowledged the scale of this challenge and has outlined its ongoing efforts to meet it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

New satellite imagery offers an unprecedented look at four active sites in Cuba most likely to be supporting China’s efforts to spy on the United States.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ambitions to expand its global intelligence-gathering capabilities have drawn it to the doorstep of the United States. In a striking revelation last year, Biden administration officials disclosed that China has access to multiple spy facilities in Cuba. While China’s activities on the island remain shrouded in secrecy, satellite imagery analyzed by CSIS provides the latest and most comprehensive assessment of where China is most likely operating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0vg6b7H.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sitting less than 100 miles south of Florida, Cuba is well positioned to keep watch on sensitive communications and activities in the region, including those of the U.S. military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The southeastern seaboard of the United States brims with military bases, combatant command headquarters, space launch centers, and military testing sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cuba has a long history of hosting foreign espionage operations targeting the United States. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union operated its largest overseas intelligence site at the Lourdes Signals Intelligence Complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rumors of China snooping from the island have simmered for decades. The issue resurfaced in mid-2023 amid media reports of a Chinese “spy base” near Havana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PILgD7V.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Satellite imagery and open-source information assessed by CSIS offers an unprecedented look at four active sites in Cuba capable of conducting electronic surveillance operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These four sites are among the most likely locations supporting China’s efforts to spy on the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signals intelligence (SIGINT) is a core element of modern spycraft. Intercepting signals transmitted by both civilian and military actors can provide countries with valuable information about their adversaries, competitors, and allies alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collecting SIGINT is a complex task that requires specialized equipment, namely antennas, optimized for the signal characteristics of their targets. The size, number, orientation, and layout of these antennas determine their capabilities and function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Wr1zXUB.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A single isotropic antenna receives signals from all directions, providing a wide coverage area but limiting its ability to focus the signal’s direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3ll3bz7.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Two antennas can be synchronized to create a stronger, focused beam that reduces interference. This is called “beamforming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mM1zMkv.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Beamforming can be further refined with more antennas. Adjusting the phase and amplitude of signals at each antenna allows for precise control over the beam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Organizing the antennas into a grid allows for steering the beam without the need to physically move the antennas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antennas arranged in a configuration known as a circularly disposed antenna array (CDAA) allow for 360-degree beamforming capability. CDAAs are highly effective at determining the origin and direction of incoming high-frequency signals and were commonly used by both the United States and Soviet Union during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AVRjQyu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other types of antennas are also used for SIGINT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dish antennas can focus radio waves into a narrow beam, making them effective for communicating with satellites far from the earth, as well as intercepting and collecting signals from a variety of sources. Radar antennas emit and receive radio waves to track physical objects, such as ships, aircraft, and missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geography impacts the effectiveness of SIGINT. Over long distances, radio signals can become difficult to isolate from surrounding signal traffic. Radar transmissions generally require a direct “line of sight” to the target, leading to limitations caused by the curvature of the Earth and other physical obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuba’s proximity to the southern United States and the Caribbean makes it a prime location for collecting SIGINT on the region. For Beijing, having access to SIGINT capabilities in Cuba would open a significant intelligence window inaccessible from within Chinese territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-following-four-sigint-sites-in-cuba-are-strategically-located-to-spy-on-the-united-states&quot;&gt;The following four SIGINT sites in Cuba are strategically located to spy on the United States.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bejucal&quot;&gt;Bejucal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;22-56-545n-82-21-4629w&quot;&gt;22° 56’ 54.5”N 82° 21’ 46.29”W&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/odIS7hp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nestled in the hills overlooking the capital city of Havana is the largest active Cuban SIGINT site reviewed by CSIS. Located near Bejucal, the complex gained notoriety during the Cold War for housing Soviet nuclear weapons in the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For decades, Bejucal has been subject to suspicion for its possible ties to Chinese intelligence activity, including in English and Spanish-language media reporting, U.S. congressional testimony, and unclassified government documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It even featured in the 2016 U.S. presidential primary debates, when Florida senator Marco Rubio called on Havana to “[kick] out this Chinese listening station in Bejucal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Satellite imagery from March 2024 reveals that the area has undergone major updates over the past decade — a clear indication of an evolving mission set. This includes the construction of a mysterious new radome that may contain a radar or ELINT system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;el-salao&quot;&gt;El Salao&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;20-01916n-75444849w&quot;&gt;20° 0’19.16”N 75°44’48.49”W&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/56BOCGx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the opposite side of the island is a new SIGINT complex that has previously gone unreported. There have been numerous unverifiable sources asserting that China has operated a large antenna field in the country’s far eastern province of Santiago de Cuba since 1999. Access to such an outpost would provide China with a highly strategic vantage point near Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, a key U.S. military base in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;CSIS analyzed satellite imagery covering 2,900 square kilometers of the province but did not find such a facility. However, CSIS did uncover a significant new SIGINT collection site under construction just east of the city of Santiago de Cuba, near a neighborhood called El Salao. The structure, whose construction began in 2021, appears to be a large CDAA with a projected diameter of 130 to 200 meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once operational, this CDAA will serve as a powerful tool for enhancing air and maritime domain awareness in the region, where the U.S. military and its international partners operate regularly. Some CDAAs of this approximate size are reportedly able to track signals anywhere from 3,000 to 8,000 nautical miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sites like these were a staple of SIGINT during the Cold War. As hostilities between the two superpowers faded and new technologies emerged, Russia and the United States decommissioned or abandoned most of their CDAAs. China, however, has been actively building major new CDAAs, including on its militarized outposts on Mischief Reef and Subi Reef in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wajay&quot;&gt;Wajay&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;23-02763n-82251348w&quot;&gt;23° 0’27.63”N 82°25’13.48”W&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gsllVmG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Less than 10 kilometers north of Bejucal lies a smaller facility known as Wajay. The presence of security fencing and two guard posts strongly suggests that the site is intended for military or other sensitive activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The compound has gradually expanded over the past 20 years, growing from just one antenna and several small buildings in 2002 to a robust complex today. It now hosts 12 antennas of various sizes and orientations, significant operations and support facilities, and even a small solar farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Unsubstantiated rumors suggest that China played a role in either the site’s construction or its modernization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No dish antennas are visible here, suggesting its purpose is primarily terrestrial signal interception and transmission. However, the variety of antennas present is a clear indication that Wajay is responsible for a reasonably complex SIGINT mission set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;calabazar&quot;&gt;Calabazar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;23-04887n-82195891w&quot;&gt;23° 0’48.87”N 82°19’58.91”W&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fwk5nHn.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Close by, a small Cuban military complex (which is associated with the name of the nearby town of Calabazar in declassified U.S. government documents) bears the hallmarks of SIGINT operations. Over a dozen dish antennas of varying sizes are scattered throughout the secured location alongside two visible pole antenna arrays. As is often the case with military intelligence installations, the number, location, and orientation of the antennas have shifted considerably over time, likely adjusting to changes in the site’s mission set. The newest dish was installed in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without access to classified materials, pinpointing the specific targets of these assets is nearly impossible. Nonetheless, the growth of space-monitoring equipment at sites like Bejucal and Calabazar is notable given that Cuba lacks its own satellites or space program. While it could operate downlink capabilities to access satellite data for a range of applications, the types of space-tracking capabilities observed are likely intended to monitor the activities of other nations (like the United States) with a presence in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even limited access to this equipment would provide China a far greater ability to monitor and communicate with its own space assets passing above the other side of the globe. Like the United States, Russia, and Europe, China operates a global network of ground stations from which it can conduct telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&amp;amp;C) on its satellites and spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has historically lacked access to ground stations in North America. Accessing installations in Cuba could help close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuban facilities would also provide the ability to monitor radio traffic and potentially intercept data delivered by U.S. satellites as they pass over highly sensitive military sites across the southern United States. Florida alone is home to the major space-launch complex at Cape Canaveral, the headquarters of both the U.S. Southern Command and Central Command, and multiple submarine and other bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-bases-and-installations-in-florida&quot;&gt;Key Bases and Installations in Florida&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/URDrFWz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collecting data on activities like military exercises, missile tests, rocket launches, and submarine maneuvers would allow China to develop a more sophisticated picture of U.S. military practices. While modern military communications are highly encrypted — meaning the contents of the messages and data are hidden — information on the frequency, origin, direction, and pace of communications traffic can provide significant intelligence value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other types of data can be collected with less concern for encryption. Notably, ELINT and radar systems, like the one possibly installed at Bejucal in recent years, are within range to monitor rocket launches from Cape Canaveral and NASA’s Kennedy Space Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studying these launches — particularly those of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy reusable first-stage booster rocket systems — is likely of keen interest to China as it attempts to catch up to U.S. leadership in space launch technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intercepting the flow of commercial communications through vital economic centers across the southern United States could provide a treasure trove of data less restricted by encryption. The region hosts major research and manufacturing centers for industries such as aerospace, electronics, biotechnology, and other key strategic sectors prioritized by Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6wgg31o.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has clear political and ideological motivations to keep afloat one of the world’s few remaining Communist Party–led governments. Yet its interests there are also clearly strategic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ambitions to expand its overseas military presence are well documented, and Cuba provides an attractive foothold for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the Caribbean. An unclassified assessment by the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence released in February 2024 lists Cuba as one of several countries where China is looking to establish military installations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuba is currently embroiled in its worst economic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union, and Havana is in desperate need of external assistance. China has emerged as a critical lifeline, providing billions in debt relief and direct assistance in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;china-cuba-military-ties&quot;&gt;China-Cuba Military Ties&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UkWMl0r.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing-tied firms are also deeply embedded in Cuba’s technology sector. Chinese tech giants Huawei and ZTE — both blacklisted by the U.S. government over espionage risks — now form the backbone of Cuba’s telecommunications infrastructure. Frequent technical exchanges between Cuban and Chinese state-backed universities and technology firms likewise facilitate technology transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA and Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) have maintained regular high-level exchanges since 1999. Most recently, in April 2024 the FAR’s most senior political leader met with a top PLA official in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is no official arms trade between the countries, China has been implicated in illicit weapons transfers to Cuba. Most notably, in 2015 a Chinese civilian-flagged cargo vessel carrying explosives and munitions bound for Cuba was intercepted by Colombian police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detailed information about China’s presence in Cuba is scarce, and decades of speculation have made it difficult to decipher reality from rumors. Yet there are growing signs that China’s economic and political leverage may be opening doors for its military and intelligence services in Cuba. Even if China does not have direct access to facilities there, the data collected by Cuban counterparts could be readily shared with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuba’s revival as a key player in U.S. strategic competition should raise concerns in Washington and beyond. While China is unlikely to seek to establish major offensive capabilities on the island in the short term, the gradual expansion of its presence there will remain an enduring concern for policymakers in the United States and its regional partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2024, the Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) at RUSI convened a roundtable discussion with 23 stakeholders from the public and private sectors in Europe. The event was part of RUSI’s work to raise awareness on key challenges for sanctions implementation through the European Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (Euro SIFMANet), funded by the National Endowment for Democracy. The discussion centred on outlining the scope of Russian sanctions evasion activity in the virtual asset industry, as well as jurisdictional vulnerabilities that can enhance exposure to this threat, and practical steps to mitigate the risk. This conference report represents the findings discussed in the roundtable discussion. None of the discussions from the event are attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An opening question considered the extent to which virtual assets are being used as part of sanctions evasion strategies. Roundtable participants agreed that when comparing the current level of sanctions evasion by the Russian government within the virtual asset industry to circumvention through traditional financial institutions, the virtual asset industry is not currently a priority for transferring funds. However, the threat of sanctions on traditional financial institutions may trigger the Russian government to redirect its focus to the virtual asset industry in order to move funds, and thus coalition countries should be exploring and anticipating such activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US, for example, restricted Russian circumvention networks in 2023 when the Biden administration announced an executive order on “Taking Additional Steps with Respect to the Russian Federation’s Harmful Activities”. This executive order authorised the US Department of the Treasury to designate a foreign financial institution that has “conducted or facilitated any significant transaction or transactions for or on behalf of any person designated” for “such sectors as may be determined to support Russia’s military-industrial base”. As a result, the risk appetite of banks, particularly in China and Türkiye, may alter, resulting in their restricting support for the movement of funds on behalf of the Russian government. With these limitations in place, the Russian government may change its operations for financial transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last three years, multiple Russian-based virtual asset companies have fallen under US sanctions. This report frequently reflects upon one of these companies, known as Garantex, as the operations of this exchange dominated the roundtable discussion. In April 2022, the US designated Garantex, operating out of Moscow, on account of its “operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy”. This exchange, according to roundtable participants, continues to operate through regulatory arbitrage – that is to say, exploiting gaps in different countries’ regulations – as the international community has failed to anticipate the adaptations in sanctions circumvention techniques. There is, therefore, a critical need to identify the scope of threats and vulnerabilities related to the virtual asset industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessing-the-scale-of-risk&quot;&gt;Assessing the Scale of Risk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overarching question of the roundtable discussion centred on whether state sponsorship of virtual asset activity is present. In the case of Garantex, the US Department of the Treasury notes that the transaction record tied to the exchange depicts the facilitation of nearly $6 million in transactions for the Russian ransomware as a service (RaaS) group Conti, and approximately $2.6 million from a darknet market known as Hydra. As noted, despite US sanctions, Garantex continues to operate by deploying different laundering methods to obscure the source of funds. However, it is not known whether such virtual asset activity can be attributed to the Russian government or oligarchs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fully understand the extent of Russia’s potential circumvention activity, the international community also needs to consider the available channels for Russia’s use of virtual assets to purchase dual-use components. To carry out this process, the Russian government or third-party individuals operating on behalf of the state would most likely need to convert virtual assets to fiat currency, as there are limited suppliers that would accept virtual assets as a legitimate form of payment. Subsequently, virtual assets would be one component in the broader sanctions evasion activity of the Russian government and therefore, the integration of this avenue within traditional circumvention techniques needs evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compounding the threat, one roundtable participant noted that malign actors tend to rely on the same platforms and facilitators. As shown by blockchain analytic data, North Korean actors have used Garantex to obscure the origins of criminal proceeds. If an attribution is uncovered, to any degree, of Russian state sponsorship of the Moscow-based exchange, financial evidence could further confirm UN sanctions violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-concerns-for-russian-virtual-asset-focused-sanctions-evasion&quot;&gt;Key Concerns for Russian Virtual Asset-Focused Sanctions Evasion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual asset-focused activity linked to potential Russian sanctions evasion includes the use of stablecoins, regulatory arbitrage, credit settlement in virtual assets, and virtual asset mining. This section outlines these avenues according to the roundtable discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stablecoins&quot;&gt;Stablecoins&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins – digital tokens that are pegged to an asset, generally fiat currency – are trending to be the preferred option for sanctions evasion, due to the lack of price fluctuation when compared to other prominent tokens. Furthermore, sanctioned entities have a greater incentive to use stablecoins pegged to the US dollar, as the US dollar still represents the primary reserve currency on an international scale, and accessing this currency through traditional means poses a challenge for such actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of this adaptation by sanctioned entities, however, is that the international community may have options to respond to the evasion due to the underlying design of features linked to the tokens. For example, Tether, a company that issues the stablecoin USDT, works with law enforcement to freeze illicit actor-linked assets. However, in regard to sanctions circumvention, this process is dependent on verifying the activity, and attribution of the individual behind the virtual asset address poses a challenge. In addition, roundtable participants noted that this solution is not always feasible. This limitation occurs if the jurisdiction where investigations take place does not have the appropriate legal provisions to enable law enforcement to carry out the freezing process in partnership with Tether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;relocation-to-other-jurisdictions&quot;&gt;Relocation to Other Jurisdictions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last two years, Russian-based businesses have relocated to other jurisdictions, including Georgia, the UAE and Turkey. The virtual asset industry is not excluded from this movement. According to participants, Garantex moved activities to Georgia in an attempt to continue operations. However, roundtable participants noted that business operations of the exchange may be impacted, as in June 2023, the National Bank of Georgia announced the approval of a rule requiring registration of virtual asset service providers (VASPs). According to this rule, fit and proper criteria for administrators and significant share owners of the entity are required for VASPs, as well as anti-money laundering/counterterrorist financing requirements. These measures may result in the movement of Garantex once again, to a neighbouring jurisdiction that has yet to implement regulations for the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with forming shell companies in neighbouring jurisdictions, Garantex also, according to participants, produces new virtual asset addresses within a five-day period to move funds, and effectively operates as a nested exchange – a company that takes advantage of larger exchanges to service its customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;credit-settlement-in-virtual-assets&quot;&gt;Credit Settlement in Virtual Assets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants first discussed the use of virtual assets for credit settlement by the Russian government. In March 2024, Russian Federal Law No. 45-FZ, which made amendments to Federal Law No. 259-FZ on digital financial assets and digital currency, included a supplement stating that “digital financial assets may be used as a consideration under foreign trade agreements (contracts) concluded between residents and non-residents, which provide for the transfer of goods, the performance of work, the provision of services, the transfer of information and the results of intellectual activity”. Nonetheless, the definition of a digital financial asset within the legislation may not include virtual assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Federal Law No. 259-FZ, digital financial assets include digital rights “to demand the transfer of emissive securities that are provided for by the decision on the issue of digital financial assets … the issue, accounting, and circulation of which are possible only by making entries in the information system on the basis of a distributed ledger, as well as into other information systems”. A Russian-based news source argues that, despite the mention of digital ledger, a definition under which blockchain technology falls, the definition excludes cryptoassets, including Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of this discussion involved the current activity within Russia regarding the use of virtual assets in credit settlement. In the event that sanctions evasion through this process occurs, Russia can use virtual assets as a method of credit settlement in a similar way to Iran. In January 2022, the head of Iran’s Trade Development Organization noted that virtual assets can act as a form of guarantee for small and medium-sized businesses that work with counterparts in other countries. Virtual assets, according to local news reports, would provide mutual guarantees and transfer the issuer’s credit to the importer of the goods into Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least one fintech service in Russia, B-crypto, promotes its specialisation in cross-border settlements in virtual assets. B-crypto supports Rosbank, a Russian credit institution, with conducting pilot transactions for corporate and private clients. According to a Russian news source, the process for cross-border settlements by B-crypto involves the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Russian company that needs to pay for imported goods or services in virtual assets must provide for the token type and indicate its virtual asset address in the contract with the supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A foreign supplier then issues an invoice for payment to the Russian company with a description of the goods and services, the amount in virtual assets and the address of the virtual asset wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the parties sign a contract, the Russian customer deposits fiat money for the purchase of virtual assets into his account in Rosbank and submits an application. The funds are then transferred to B-crypto, which buys crypto in “friendly countries” and sends it to a foreign supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US designated Russian fintech service B-crypto in March 2024 for “operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;virtual-asset-mining-to-generate-revenue&quot;&gt;Virtual Asset Mining to Generate Revenue&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants identified that Russia could use natural resources to generate revenue through virtual asset mining. This process, first demonstrated by Iran, incorporates the use of cheap oil and natural gas as energy for virtual asset mining. Through the mining process, miners receive newly minted tokens that represent value on the blockchain that is not tied to previous transactions. In Iran, miners receiving the funds, according to the country’s licensing regime, are required to send funds to the central bank. These funds then support credit settlement for importing goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2022, the US sanctioned BitRiver, a company that hosts mining equipment for customers. In return for hosting the equipment, the client pays for the energy consumption and machine maintenance. According to the US Treasury, BitRiver helped Russia to “monetize its natural resources”. One participant identified that the underlying risk of generating newly minted virtual assets is that a VASP may not identify the source of funds as high risk, meaning that an individual can exchange the funds for fiat currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of undisputed Russian territory, this process is carried out by Russian individuals in illegally annexed and occupied territories. In these areas, the Russian government provides subsidised energy to keep the territory operational. Some of this energy, depending on the territory, is then fed into virtual asset mining operations to generate revenue that is free of any indication of sanctions evasion activity, and can be used to fund procurement or other illicit international Russian activity. Participants also noted that there is a potential exposure to this threat in Africa due to the presence of the Wagner Group and cheap electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a risk of virtual asset mining pools being used as a laundering mechanism. Notably, B-crypto, the fintech service in Russia, claims on its website to have “access to the largest mining pools”. Participants noted that when monitoring virtual asset mining activity, stakeholders can identify where the nodes are located and determine an estimation on the level of revenue generation, but error exists in the case of a miner using a virtual private network to obfuscate their location. To resolve this challenge, the private and public sectors need to identify where the newly minted coins are sent. Notably, in the past, new coins were perceived as more valuable, as they had less exposure to potential crimes given their brand new nature. As of 2024, this perception has changed considerably, and now new coins are seen as a risk by some VASPs. However, there is still a possibility for miners to try to develop a legitimate transaction history prior to the funds reaching a VASP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A notable deficiency is the lack of attention applied by jurisdictions to virtual asset mining. Virtual asset mining companies often do not fall under the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) definition of a VASP due to the lack of custody of the client’s funds. As a result, some jurisdictions do not consider related risks while conducting a sectoral virtual asset risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;public-sector-challenges-and-responses&quot;&gt;Public Sector Challenges and Responses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulators of the industry need to understand how to identify and tackle sanctions evasion in the virtual asset industry. The roundtable participants discussed three topics in this regard: vulnerabilities that exacerbate exposure to Russian sanctions evasion activity; challenges around virtual asset regulation and enforcement; and lack of training and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When outlining general vulnerabilities that increase jurisdictional exposure to Russian sanctions evasion, participants identified that these factors include, but are not limited to: the ease of immigration for Russian nationals to that jurisdiction; the level of Russian language in the population; and lack of enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable participants then discussed challenges around virtual asset regulation and enforcement. One concern raised by participants was the pressure applied to jurisdictions by the FATF to quickly implement regulation for the virtual asset industry. The short timeline for a jurisdiction to implement the related requirements in order to avoid censure and greylisting has resulted in inefficient regulation favouring form over substance, without consideration of associated risks. Jurisdictions need to be cautious about this process and ensure that they pass legislation that they can enforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In relation to enforcement, authorities still have difficulty identifying VASPs that are operating illegally. To compound this challenge, participants said that company formation agents set up by Russian individuals are facilitating the relocation of high-risk VASPs. Along with this movement, participants noted that some high-risk VASPs have started to use obscure names for their companies to mask their involvement in virtual assets and evade oversight by designated authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges around suspicious transaction reports (STRs) also persist. The designated authority for receiving STRs in high-risk jurisdictions needs training to understand how to identify and analyse sanctions evasion activity in the virtual asset industry. However, this challenge is exacerbated if the quality of the STRs submitted by VASPs is low. Supervisors therefore need to ensure that the reports submitted by VASPs are meeting expectations and that feedback is provided to the VASP industry on how to meet those expectations. Participants noted that in some cases, VASPs dump information from blockchain analytics tools into an STR, overloading the designated authority receiving the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the roundtable discussion resulted in a question on how jurisdictions should identify which blockchain analytics tool to purchase in order to investigate suspicious activity. Each blockchain analytics company uses publicly available information on transactions and analyses it through company-specific methods, which the companies do not share, in order to keep a competitive edge. Along with separate methodologies, companies may have different data coverage and data available within their product. However, it may not be feasible for authorities in certain jurisdictions to purchase more than one tool to access the full scope of information, and therefore, investigations may be limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;private-sector-challenges-and-responses&quot;&gt;Private Sector Challenges and Responses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable discussion outlined challenges and responses for blockchain analytics companies, financial institutions and VASPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;blockchain-analytics-companies&quot;&gt;Blockchain Analytics Companies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants said that illicit actors have attempted to gain access to credible blockchain analytics tools in order to monitor attribution and the level of visibility of their illicit activity. To restrict access that bad actors have to their platforms, blockchain analytics providers should conduct robust know-your-customer measures and due diligence on their customers. One participant highlighted their experience of an entity connected with sanctions evasion that had attempted to gain access to a blockchain analytics tool in order to gather information. To combat this risk and strengthen their sanctions compliance, participants noted that some blockchain analytics providers have denied access to their tools for individuals located in Russia or indirectly linked to Russia, and for entities where the ultimate beneficial ownership is tied to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;financial-institutions&quot;&gt;Financial Institutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To procure dual-use items, the Russian government or third-party individuals operating on behalf of the Russian state would most likely need to convert virtual assets to fiat currency. Therefore, financial institutions will still act as gatekeepers for restricting sanctions circumvention. To develop trust and verification for banking VASPs, some financial institutions use blockchain analytics tools. These tools can support financial institutions with identifying risk, as some include additional information on VASPs and their specific exposure to financial crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;virtual-asset-service-providers&quot;&gt;Virtual Asset Service Providers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For VASPs, a challenge can be linked to the fact that when the US Office of Foreign Assets Control lists a virtual asset address on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list, there are other unidentified addresses tied to the sanctioned address. Identifying these virtual asset addresses requires blockchain analytics tools or extensive time to uncover the unidentified addresses manually. Therefore, identifying addresses associated with the sanctioned virtual asset address takes significant resources for less mature VASPs without access to blockchain analytics tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-insights-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Insights and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable discussion resulted in the following observations that international stakeholders should consider in order to restrict Russian sanctions evasion in the virtual asset industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Despite US sanctions, the virtual asset exchange Garantex still continues to operate.&lt;/strong&gt; Garantex continues operations by forming shell companies and registering in neighbouring jurisdictions, as well as producing new virtual asset addresses within a five-day period to move funds for operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The public and private sectors need to coordinate to increase the speed of response to sanctions evasion activity in the virtual asset industry.&lt;/strong&gt; It is important that VASPs are included in public-private partnerships as they are often not invited to participate. This limitation stems from the fact that such partnerships are built on a circle of trust so that information can be shared. These forums initially developed with commercial banks that have an innate distrust of VASPs, hence the latter’s exclusion. A key development that may begin to address this perception of VASPs in Europe is the introduction – and implementation – of the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding should be provided by governments to train supervising authorities within jurisdictions neighbouring Russia on how to analyse virtual asset-related STRs.&lt;/strong&gt; The process of training designated authorities on analysing STRs should provide awareness on Russian sanctions evasion typologies and ensure that there is access to the necessary resources for investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blockchain analytics providers should ensure that they closely review customers attempting to gain access to their tools.&lt;/strong&gt; Illicit actors have attempted to access blockchain analytics tools in order to monitor attributions and the level of visibility into their activities. To restrict this threat, blockchain analytics providers should consider conducting know-your-customer measures on new clients, along with due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jurisdictions need to ensure that they pass virtual asset legislation that they can enforce.&lt;/strong&gt; The short timeline for a jurisdiction to implement FATF requirements related to virtual assets – and thus avoid the risk of public censure by the FATF – has resulted in inefficient regulation without consideration of associated risks. Jurisdictions therefore need to take a comprehensive approach when developing regulation for the virtual asset industry to ensure that enforcement is feasible, and should avoid prioritising form over substance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The FATF should assess the risk posed by virtual asset mining companies falling outside its current definition of a VASP.&lt;/strong&gt; Virtual asset mining companies often do not fall under the FATF definition of a VASP due to the lack of custody of clients funds. As a result, some jurisdictions do not consider related risks while conducting a sectoral virtual asset risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, the roundtable discussion identified a range of areas of vulnerability connected with the potential use of virtual assets and related infrastructure to facilitate Russia’s circumvention of both financial sanctions and procurement restrictions on high-priority items. While this may not currently be a central element of Russia’s sanctions evasion strategy, Ukraine’s allies need to ensure that, as Western sanctions on Russia tighten, the virtual asset community is equipped for what will inevitably be a growing front in the Kremlin’s sanctions evasion activity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;官指控方至少尚有3證人　審期料至8月中&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/q51SFZK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【法庭線】《反恐條例》首案，不認罪7人周五（28日）在高等法院踏入第43天審訊，再多一名證物警員完成作供。法官張慧玲對陪審團指，控方尚有至少3名證人，「分分鐘」下周三才完成舉證，審期「覺得去到8月中嘅機會都大…希望大家有心理準備」。警長陳智培稱，他兩度使用軟件「Cellebrite」擷取被告賴振邦手機資料，由另一警長梁樂文從中「搵嘢」，再由陳匯出及整理、燒錄光碟。匯出後，資料會載入試算表，陳承認曾刪去與案無關的「欄目」，但「打橫嘅資料」，即載入手機資料的「列」沒有增減，「我用整理去形容啦」。另外，警長在辯方盤問下確認，處理本案證物時，未考取「Cellebrite」檢驗資歷，事隔一年，即2021年初才考獲相關證書。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;擷取賴振邦手機-警稱有專業資格處理&quot;&gt;擷取賴振邦手機 警稱有專業資格處理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方傳召案發時替被告賴振邦手機取證的警長陳智培作供，主問下他提到當年隸屬網絡安全科技罪案調查組、數碼法理鑑證 B 隊，修畢「流動裝置法理鑑證課程」，獲取證專業資格。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱，2020年1月20日，他經軟件「Cellebrite」擷取賴振邦手機資料；翌日，負責調查本案的偵緝警員梁樂文（後升為警長）來其辦公室，檢視手機內容如相片、影片、Telegram 訊息和網頁瀏覽紀錄。陳稱之後把電話封存於僅他知道密碼的鐵櫃內，直至梁樂文同年4月再來；梁「負責搵嘢」，即檢視、揀選當中部分 Telegram 訊息，由陳「操作」，即匯出及整理、燒錄光碟。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上向證人播放賴手機內兩條影片，其中一條展示疑似接上紅黑電線的電路板，並有男聲指，「本身係咁嘅，電池座啦，呢個 2A 電池座。同埋呢個，呢個係 1850 嘅電池座，兩粒 18650，3粒 2A 電，個結構係咁囉，我都唔知喺邊度買呢嚿嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警認事隔一年-才獲取證軟件資歷&quot;&gt;警認事隔一年 才獲取證軟件資歷&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在賴振邦的代表大狀余承熹盤問下，陳稱他2014年首度接觸「Cellebrite」。余指，陳的書面口供提過自己在2021年取得「Cellebrite」手機檢驗相關資格；問他是哪個月份取得？陳稱是2021年初。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余質疑，亦即陳處理賴振邦時，未受訓練、無相關資歷？陳答「未考取個 certified 資歷」。余追問，取該證書前的課程上課時間，有否與處理賴電話時重疊？陳答沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警解釋兩度擷手機資料-因首次沒擷出-tg-訊息&quot;&gt;警解釋兩度擷手機資料 因首次沒擷出 TG 訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余另問，為何經 Cellebrite 擷取資料後，分成兩個 .zip 壓縮檔。陳解釋 Cellebrite 有兩個擷檔方式，他先用「advanced logical」，但使用後沒擷出 Telegram 資料，故第二次改用「full file system」。余又問，陳基於甚麼認為所擷資料完整？陳答如失敗，系統會提示錯誤，但當時程式沒顯示類似提示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余再問，他擷取資料整個工序涉整整7小時，是否全程對著電腦坐著、沒睡覺？陳同意，「除咗去廁所」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警否認有刪改內容&quot;&gt;警否認有刪改內容&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於陳主問下稱，經 Cellebrite 擷取資料後，系統會生成一個試算表，載有相關 Telegram 對話內容；余問現時看到的版本，是否系統原始版本？陳答資料一樣，但他曾刪走一些欄目（column），「留返啲與案有關嘅資料」，但強調所取內容沒有改，「我用整理去形容啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控周凱靈覆問時，問陳有否對試算表中的記項做任何動作，例如加減。陳答「打橫嘅資料，無」。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;警指多次與污點證人會面屬「閒話家常」　否認曾威嚇被告&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zKwYR5G.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【法庭線】《反恐條例》首案，不認罪的7人周四（27日）在高等法院踏入第42天審訊。警長梁樂文分別曾拘捕及會見被告李家田和賴振邦。他在盤問下否認曾威嚇兩被告，包括毆打、施行「水刑」，及稱「你屋企咪有兩個細路嘅，如果佢哋俾人推出馬路都唔知咩事。」辯方另關注，梁多次與從犯證人會面。梁表示只是閒話家常，稱從犯證人心情複雜，會面時會安慰對方。他否認警方與從犯證人達成協議，又指若知悉從犯證人黃振強投訴被捕時遭其毆打，不會繼續參與本案調查。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警長梁樂文負責擷取被告賴振邦及李家田的電話資料。梁周三（26日）在控方主問下稱，經警方破解及復原資料後，在涉案電話檢取賴振邦的照片、遙控裝置照片等，另確認 Telegram 用名「接完紙鶴未？」，曾與另一被告蔡凱明談及製作炸彈遙控裝置。控方早前提及，賴的 Telegram 名稱為「接完紙鶴未？」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑與污點證人屢會面-警閒話家常&quot;&gt;辯方質疑與污點證人屢會面 警：閒話家常&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方周四盤問，梁同意於本案參與程度高，除處理被告賴振邦及李家田電話資料外，亦曾會見轉任控方證人的黃振強、彭軍壕和蘇緯軒，並就此撰寫調查報告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告張銘裕的代表大狀姚本成關注，調查報告沒記錄會面內容。梁稱，此為一貫做法，毋須於報告中紀錄。姚遂問，就與彭軍壕的會面，彭有否提出特別要求，如希望「告少啲」、「阿 sir 畀返啲面我，我爸爸都係警方人員喎」等；梁稱沒有。姚又關注，彭是從犯證人，現時無從得知其錄取口供的經過，如是否有人提醒、或一字不漏講述其版本；梁同意沒詳細記錄與彭會面的內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;姚另指，於彭軍壕錄取口供後，警方仍多次與其會面，其中2021年下半年共有6次見面。梁指見面均是彭要求，稱污點證人的心情複雜，故與其閒話家常和安慰他。就部分會面沒列出會見時間，梁承認是個人疏忽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;姚質疑，於2021年11月的會面中，梁在記事冊寫上「interview for IG」；梁解釋，「IG」意指收集情報，指此為會見犯人的籠統寫法。至於為何沒於記事冊，將其他會面標示為「for IG」，梁解釋指沒抄襲早前的紀錄，重申為籠統寫法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警否認毆打水刑威嚇李家田&quot;&gt;警否認毆打、「水刑」威嚇李家田&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告李家田一方指，梁警有份上門拘捕李家田。就李被捕時的情況，辯方指李遭警以「水刑」等方式施襲，威嚇「殺咗你都冇問題，就喺出面搵棵樹吊死你都得」；又稱「可以話你搶槍，喺度開槍啪咗你都得…同樣嘅情況可以出現喺你啊媽身上。」梁一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另指出，當日警方搜查隊搜屋時，李被鎖在廁所內、梁曾指示搜查隊毋須搜查廁所、李家田因警方威逼利誘而作出招認；梁一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至被捕翌日，李被帶返住址蒐證，當時梁負責拍攝相片。辯方引述相片拍攝時間，指李家田房內桌子上原先沒有綠色袋，及後該綠色袋出現在桌子上。梁解釋，拍攝時發現有同僚已檢取該綠色袋，遂著同僚將袋子放回桌上，拍攝後才放入證物袋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質警與從犯證人達協議-警稱無權處理&quot;&gt;辯方質警與從犯證人達協議 警稱無權處理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李家田的代表大狀林芷瑩則關注，轉任控方證人的黃振強，投訴被捕時遭警員毆打，而梁有份入屋拘捕黃。梁指，事前不知黃振強作出投訴，若知悉不會繼續參與調查本案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於另一名從犯證人彭軍壕，辯方指彭的錄影會面與「無損權益口供」有很大出入。梁指，被捕人於被捕後或會推卸責任，但無法證實其說法；及至為彭錄取口供時，則按其說法紀錄，沒對比與錄影會面有否出入。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方質疑，警方有否向彭提供內容，著他指控其他人？梁否認。至於彭曾去信律政司，指據雙方早前同意（as agreed），將撤銷《反恐條例》下爆炸罪和串謀謀殺。辯方質疑，警方是否早與彭達成協議；梁否認，稱警方無權處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警否認威嚇賴振邦&quot;&gt;警否認威嚇賴振邦&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告賴振邦的代表大狀是香媛問及，賴於2020年1月19日被捕後於警署內的事。梁指，當時會見賴以了解其個人、政治背景；同日較早時段，梁亦分別會見被告許湛榮，及被列為同謀者的張堅順。梁確認，張為賴振邦的姐夫，於2020年8月離港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，賴被捕後沒作招認，故警員當晚在警署內毆打他，又指梁曾稱：「你屋企咪有兩個細路嘅，如果佢哋俾人推出馬路都唔知咩事。」辯方又指，警員事後多次與從犯證人彭軍壕會面，目的是「拉多啲人落水」。梁一概否認。辯方早前亦向拘捕李家田的警員指出相關案情。&lt;/p&gt;

With the West in danger of losing out to Russian and Chinese influence, it is urgent to reassess what it can offer the region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following more than a month of protests, on 3 May 2024, the speaker of Georgia’s parliament signed off a controversial law on “transparency on foreign influence”, better known as “the Russian law”. The new legislation obliges all non-profit and media organisations that are receiving more than 20% of funding from abroad to register as entities pursuing foreign interests. The Georgian government insists that the law does not intend to crack down on critical voices but rather ensures transparency of funding. Yet, tens of thousands of protesters as well as the president of Georgia argue that the foreign agents law resembles Russian legislation introduced in 2012 and used against dissent. Many believe that the government will weaponise the law ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled in October 2024 in order to suppress media and watchdogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;georgias-european-future-at-stake&quot;&gt;Georgia’s European Future at Stake&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The backlash over the foreign agents law indicates that Georgia’s current political crisis is not just about the protection of civil liberties and independent media, but has broader geopolitical implications. Once a champion of democracy in the region, Georgia’s European future is now much more uncertain. The ruling Georgian Dream party is increasingly employing anti-Western rhetoric and claiming that Western funds are in some cases being used to encourage regime change in Georgia. The ruling party’s officials have gone as far as spreading conspiracy theories regarding the alleged existence of a “Global War Party” that is pushing for a repeat of the Ukraine scenario in Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia, which has remained consistently pro-European and pro-Western over the last two decades with over 89% of citizens favouring EU integration, has never experienced such a swift rise in anti-Western narratives. Ironically, this official mood swing is taking place at a time when Georgia has finally become an EU candidate country, with the prospect of opening accession talks with Brussels in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The turbulence in Georgia is a reminder to the EU of how state policy can drastically shift during the protracted waiting periods for European candidacy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of recent developments and the country’s democratic backsliding, Georgia’s EU integration process is likely to be officially paused, as indicated by a number of EU officials. According to EU High Representative Josep Borrell, the foreign agents law is “incompatible with European values”. On 24 June 2024, following a Foreign Affairs Council meeting where political developments in Georgia were discussed, Borrell clearly reiterated that unless the Georgian government changes its course of action, Georgia will not progress on the EU path. Moreover, in response to the foreign agents law, the EU is considering downgrading diplomatic relations with Georgia and freezing financial aid to the government. Yet, the law is only one example out of a set of divisive laws that the Georgian government has adopted or intends to adopt soon, making the country’s EU integration dream even more distant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the Georgian parliament bypassed the presidential veto over the so-called “offshore law” which intends to encourage asset transfers from offshore accounts to Georgia through exemption on taxation until 2028. The law threatens to make Georgia a target of money laundering activities, especially from sanctioned individuals. On 4 May 2024, just a day after the foreign agents law was finally approved, the ruling party brought another piece of legislation forward targeting LGBT propaganda. This initiative comes from the same anti-Western playbook, with the government accusing Western partners of using local NGOs to spread LGBT propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the unwillingness of the government to listen to tens of thousands of protesters tirelessly rallying in the streets of Tbilisi to protect Georgia’s European future, much remains uncertain in the run-up to this year’s elections. The government of Georgia has been increasingly looking for alternative strategic partners such as China, emphasising the economic benefits of bringing Chinese investment into the country. Recently, the Georgian government announced that a Chinese consortium had won the much anticipated major strategic Anaklia deep sea port project. Yet, given overwhelming support for Georgia’s EU integration, it does not appear that Georgians see China as an alternative to the West and the billions of dollars of investment that Western countries, particularly the US and the EU, have made in democracy-building efforts in Georgia. Thus, the stakes could not be higher for the upcoming 2024 parliamentary elections, which will largely be about a choice over Georgia’s foreign policy trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-can-the-west-respond&quot;&gt;How Can the West Respond?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The turbulence in Georgia is a reminder to the EU of how state policy can drastically shift during the protracted waiting periods for European candidacy, particularly when reinforced by rival authoritarian states interfering in domestic politics through disinformation, corruption and hard power coercion. Moreover, for the West as a whole, it is a stark warning that promises of integration are no longer enough to incentivise cooperation amid lucrative Chinese economic incentives in the form of development projects and with Russia waging potent disinformation campaigns that are effectively distorting public opinion towards Western values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tug-of-war between the West and the rest is particularly noticeable in Georgia and the wider former Soviet Union (FSU). The South Caucasus and Central Asia stand at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, and influence in these regions is key to accessing Eurasia, with the Middle Corridor developing into one of the fastest growing inter-state trade networks. Naturally, this has caught the interest of both the East and the West, with both looking to expand into Russia’s former sphere of interest. However, Western expansion is currently restricted by several factors. First, Russia’s geographic position and historic economic links within these regions still incentivises cooperation. Second, the amount of money that China is willing to throw at development projects within the FSU dwarfs what the West has offered so far. Third, there is growing evidence of state capture in several states in the FSU, such as Georgian Dream’s increasing control over Georgian institutions and media with the aim of limiting external influence from unwelcome parties, which now include the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the fact remains that with Russia embroiled in Ukraine, the West has an opportunity to get its foot in the door in the FSU. Currently, the momentum is negligible, as exemplified by UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron’s visit to Central Asia, culminating with a commitment of £50 million for “assistance” to the region. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent visit to Uzbekistan saw over £300 million invested in the construction of a nuclear plant, a far more concrete contribution that will pay much larger political and economic dividends in the future. Similarly, France’s supply of military equipment to Armenia has done far more to influence the South Caucasus than the many years of EU “peacekeeping” along the Armenia–Azerbaijan border. If the West wants to increase its influence in the FSU, it must focus on what tangible benefits it can provide and be prepared to foot the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The sooner multipolarity in the region is embraced, the more quickly Western foreign policy can begin to compete with expanding Russian and Chinese influence&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the emerging multipolarity of the FSU, there are clear limits to the effectiveness of current EU integration policy. Decades of waiting for approval has empowered individuals with vested interests to extend their influence in domestic politics, while allowing authoritarian powers the time to sway opinion through development projects, economic investment, and disinformation campaigns. Now is the time for a policy reassessment to understand what the EU can tangibly offer these regions that can compete with Russia and China’s authoritarian advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia’s drastic policy shift threatens to further destabilise the geopolitical balance in the South Caucasus. What was once a hub of pro-Western democracy has been swayed by the allure of populism, likely amplified by the geopolitical interests of Russia and China. Despite Georgian Dream’s legislative crackdown, many in Georgia still hold European aspirations, setting the scene for what will be a critical election for the future of Georgia later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an opportunity for the West to demonstrate its worth in the South Caucasus and the wider FSU. Geographic proximity, existing economic links, and an authoritarian focus on development projects mean that there is little that Western powers can do to incentivise these states to completely sever ties with Russia and China. The sooner multipolarity in the region is embraced, the more quickly Western foreign policy can begin to compete with expanding Russian and Chinese influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;政府化驗師負責檢驗貨倉的伸縮棍-指款式相類&quot;&gt;政府化驗師負責檢驗貨倉的伸縮棍 指款式相類&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;政府化驗師吳嘉豪博士確認，於2020年1月15日檢驗警方在「屠龍」荃灣貨倉搜獲的11支伸縮棍，他指各伸縮棍款式類同。吳在庭上示範如何打開伸縮棍，顯示棍會分為3節，共長約63厘米。他又指伸縮棍打開後，基本上會自行鎖定。代表張銘裕的大律師姚本成盤問時，問到伸縮棍是否與行山杖的伸縮功能大同小異；吳表示好像是。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警長稱負責將賴振邦電話交網罪科破解&quot;&gt;警長稱負責將賴振邦電話交網罪科破解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案發時為偵緝警員、現晉升為警長的5820梁樂文確認，他當時為本案的調查員，當日將拘捕賴振邦時檢取的電話，交予網絡安全及科技罪案調查科，以進行法證檢驗。經網罪科同事使用 Cellebrite 程式破解電話後，梁負責檢視內容，並揀選與案件、電話持有人及其他疑犯有關的資料。梁發現賴曾與蔡凱明在 Telegram 討論製作炸彈遙控裝置。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警長承認處理截圖時出錯&quot;&gt;警長承認處理截圖時出錯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁承認在處理截圖等資料時兩度出錯，並在庭上道歉稱：「唔好意思，法官閣下」、「再一次致歉」。另外，電話中有一段介紹電池及電線裝置的影片。梁亦確認其中兩張照片有GPS定位資料。梁另確認於另一被告李家田被捕後翌日、即2020年6月12日，前往李住所拍照。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;由於控方表示身體不適發燒故案件押後至明27日續審&quot;&gt;由於控方表示身體不適發燒，故案件押後至明（27日）續審。&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/e4ATGpN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，共45人罪成。被控方指為組織者的戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及吳政亨5人，今（26日）續求情。代表戴耀廷的資深大律師黃繼明力陳，涉案謀劃在《國安法》生效後才違法，法庭判刑時不應考慮此前行為；又指戴雖曾具領導角色，但《國安法》後已非主腦，他不會參選立法會，也無法控制其他人行為。不過法官拒絕接納，法官陳慶偉並指，肯定戴耀廷沒有退出謀劃，指他是立法會選舉延期後，唯一一名繼續參加謀劃的組織者被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方並呈上由港大法律學院講座教授陳弘毅、和首席講師張達明等撰寫的求情信，表揚戴對港大及社會的貢獻；又力陳「非暴力」是戴一生堅信的信念，他真誠誤信否決預算案沒有違法，甚至「誤導了自己」，但他做這些事非為個人利益，而是出於畢生對法治和民主的堅定決心。不過法官陳慶偉質疑，戴耀廷指初選不違法，或是游說其他人繼續參與初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成等3人獲安排正庭旁聽&quot;&gt;鄒家成等3人獲安排正庭旁聽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪、周天行、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋。戴耀廷由資深大律師黃繼明代表，趙家賢由大律師利琛代表，區諾軒和鍾錦麟由大律師陳慕賢代表，吳政亨由大律師石書銘代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;求情5人於近10時進入法庭。吳政亨與親友做手勢，又豎起拇指。昨日有戴眼鏡的戴耀廷，今早則除下了眼鏡，看到旁聽親友時微笑揮手。區諾軒入庭時向旁聽席鞠躬，鍾錦麟向律師揮手。區諾軒、趙家賢和鍾錦麟與昨日一樣，坐在被告欄離旁聽席最遠的位置，與其他被告分隔。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於昨日在延伸庭看直播的譚凱邦、劉頴匡、鄒家成3人，則同獲安排在正庭就坐，鄒入庭後向旁聽席聳肩，並與譚和劉不住交談。其餘列席認罪被告繼續被帶到兩個延伸庭觀看直播，黃之鋒、余慧明、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒、何桂藍、黃碧雲、黃子悅7人在二號法庭；施德來、彭卓棋、鄭達鴻、伍健瑋、梁晃維、馮達浚6人在一號法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方法庭不應懲罰國安法前行為&quot;&gt;辯方：法庭不應懲罰《國安法》前行為&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表戴耀廷的資深大律師黃繼明今繼續陳詞。黃強調，戴耀廷在2020年7月1日《國安法》生效前的行為絕非違法，雖然他曾被不少人批評，但這並非道德或政治的法庭，法庭判刑時不應考慮，否則是懲罰戴的合法行為，等同賦予《國安法》追溯力。法官陳慶偉指，但本案屬持續罪行；黃同意，但強調被告的協議因《國安法》才變成違法，其罪責只在於《國安法》生效後仍沒有停止。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續舉例，若他以一年時間計劃打劫，其後再與另兩名法官達成協議落實，辯方認為判刑時不用考慮他此前的計劃？法官陳慶偉補充，假設陳仲衡一直在腦海中計劃，並曾將其意圖寫在紙上，最終3名法官達成協議，那張紙能否成為證據？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃認為並非正確類比，因打劫一直都是違法行為，但否決預算案本來並非刑事罪行、也不是民事過失，只是在《國安法》下才非法。他又強調，普通法下，除非法律禁止，否則所有行為均是合法，若被告《國安法》此前的行為真有違法，肯定政府會採取行動。法官李運騰續指，控方並沒有指控被告在7月1日前違法，否則控罪日期會提前。辯方重申，法庭不應懲罰戴耀廷以往合法行為。陳慶偉則再引打劫例子，指是懲罰長久以來有預謀的串謀（very lengthy and premeditated plan），黃稱不肯定是否正確，陳則表示，肯定那是正確的做法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指正在找謀劃背後的黑武士&quot;&gt;官指正在找謀劃背後的「黑武士」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，涉案計劃的規模是判刑的考慮因素，法官衡量計劃規模時，能否只審視《國安法》生效後、而非生效前的行為？黃繼明指，初選本身不違法，違法的是被告協議達成的行為，即無差別否決預算案，而該部分與戴無關，他根本不會參選，亦無法控制或指揮其他人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡即以電影《星球大戰》角色作比喻，指「35+計劃」是尋找進入立法會無差別否決預算案的35名「白兵（stormtroopers）」，而「我們正在嘗試找出謀劃背後的黑武士（Darth Vader）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方國安法後戴耀廷已非主腦&quot;&gt;辯方：《國安法》後戴耀廷已非主腦&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃繼明續指，《國安法》後，戴耀廷已非涉案謀劃的主腦、也不能再控制該謀劃，法官陳慶偉遂問，那是誰在7月1日後負責（in charge），是否區諾軒？他並指，因本案組織者只有戴和區兩人，換言之辯方是指控區諾軒。鄒家成和劉頴匡等一度望向區諾軒發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡又指，若辯方說戴耀廷在初選沒有任何角色，他7月中根本不需要宣布「休息」，黃指他的確不需要，只是作「交代」。惟法官陳慶偉明言，不接受戴在7月1日之後沒有任何角色；法官李運騰亦指，據趙家賢證供，戴在8月時仍提出望民主動力捐約100萬元予香港民研，以收集市民對否決預算案的意見。法官陳仲衡亦提出，有「三投三不投」計劃，此時譚凱邦、鄒家成和劉頴匡均大笑，吳政亨則無奈苦笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃澄清，不是指戴完全沒有角色，並接納戴7月1日前在謀劃是領導角色，但他7月1日後已不再是組織者，沒有打算進入立法會否決財案，也不能控制或指揮其他人如此做，是否參選和否決全然是其他人的決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官拒納戴耀廷國安法後角色輕微&quot;&gt;官拒納戴耀廷《國安法》後角色輕微&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉在早休後，表示法庭不接納辯方指，戴耀廷2020年7月1日前的行為，與決定其罪責無關；亦不接納辯方指戴在7月1日後於本案只有很少或沒有角色。法庭亦無需辯方再就內地法律文件是否適用陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方呈陳弘毅張達明等求情信-指戴主張非暴力畢生追求民主法治&quot;&gt;辯方呈陳弘毅、張達明等求情信 指戴主張非暴力、畢生追求民主法治&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就戴的個人情況陳詞。辯方呈上港大法律學院講座教授陳弘毅、港大法律學院講座首席講師張達明、蘇穎智牧師及戴耀廷本人的求情信。其中陳和張讚揚戴對港大和法律界的貢獻，指戴是最高質素的法律學者，曾發布多篇有關法律的文章，不僅獲很多教學獎項，亦曾於2001年因其推動基本法及人權教育，獲政府頒授榮譽勳章。蘇牧師則指戴是基督徒，對教會有重要貢獻，亦關注警方與學生之間的衝突。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，戴一直主張非暴力，他真誠錯誤相信（genuine mistaken belief）運用否決權在《國安法》下並非違法，而他做這些事並非為任何個人利益，而是出於畢生對法治和民主、尤其是普選的堅定決心，而戴現時已知道其手段是錯誤。黃又指，非暴力是戴耀廷一生「堅定、堅定、堅定」的信念（“… non-violence has been a firm, firm, firm belief of D1 all his life.”）。法官陳仲衡指，控方本案已清楚表明串謀不涉暴力，這不是一個問題（non-issue）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方戴真誠誤信無違法或誤導了自己-官質疑&quot;&gt;辯方：戴真誠誤信無違法、或誤導了自己 官質疑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃繼明又引不同新聞，指案發時不同法律學者和社會人士，包括政府、湯家驊、葉劉淑儀、陳弘毅等，均無明確表明初選或否決預算案屬違法。法官陳仲衡質疑，《國安法》剛實施，無人能肯定地說某些行為是否違法。黃回應，若有人計劃在立法會放炸彈，肯定每人都能說是違反《國安法》；但本案情況正是不確定有否違法，戴當時真誠相信是合法並非不合理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續主動提到〈真攬炒十步〉一文，指迫使特首辭職只是第七步，問辯方是否記得第八至十步。翻查資料，相關步驟提及《國安法》適用香港後，街頭抗爭變激烈和出現血腥鎮壓，港人發動「三罷」令社會陷入停頓等。黃指文章是在《國安法》前寫成，只涉運用憲制權力；惟陳慶偉不同意，指文章談及暴動和示威，超出運用憲制權力。黃回應那從來並非謀劃一部分，戴亦無因此被控；而戴終其一生從沒有提倡暴力，暴力並非他的意圖、亦與本案無關，不應納入考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指，其意思不是會將此納入加刑因素，只是認為辯方不能說戴耀廷是完全無辜、擁有真誠錯誤的想法；又指戴在《國安法》生效後曾強調在普通法下違法，因他知道《國安法》是由中國制定。陳遂說，「我可能是錯的」，但指戴耀廷這樣說，或是游說其他人繼續參與初選。黃強調，戴當時是以法律學者，而非共謀者或謀劃組織者的身分發言。法官陳仲衡指，若然如此，為何戴在《國安法》後向所有參加者指不提否決每個議案？陳慶偉亦指，其他參與者或認為某程度被戴誤導。黃回應，戴「可能自己誤導了自己」，強調他當時真誠相信是違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方攬炒十步僅博弈理論-不代表一定發生&quot;&gt;辯方：「攬炒十步」僅博弈理論 不代表一定發生&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後引戴耀廷的求情信，提及「攬炒十步」只是博弈理論（game theory），屬假設的情況、非預測未來的「水晶球」，事實不一定會按照他所指的逐步發生，強調戴一直也沒有提倡暴力，若因此指他提倡或鼓勵暴力，是對他不公。法官陳慶偉則指，判詞明言戴是望推翻一國兩制，辯方說法與裁決相違。副刑事檢控專員萬德豪其後亦補充，戴認罪案情承認撰寫〈真攬炒十步〉一文，以引發血腥鎮壓和外國制裁，目的明顯顛覆政權和癱瘓政府運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指肯定戴無退出-是唯一一名繼續參加謀劃的組織者&quot;&gt;官指肯定戴無退出 是唯一一名繼續參加謀劃的組織者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃繼明續指，在中聯辦譴責初選或違法後，戴耀廷重新評估情況並於7月15日選擇退出。陳慶偉即指他沒有退出，僅說會「休息」，而且他繼續與區諾軒和趙家賢談及有關民調的事。黃指，戴仍是被動角色，並非「首要分子」和「積極參加者」。惟陳慶偉指，認為戴耀廷是立法會選舉延期後，唯一一名繼續參加謀劃的組織者被告，又認為「他可能沒有之前那樣積極參與，但他肯定沒有退出」。黃指，戴決定退出，不代表他不會見任何人，他仍要處理眾籌資金。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡又質疑，戴是35+的設計者，辯方說戴宣布退出初選，為何他退出時沒有建議其他參與者一同退出？黃重申，就算戴曾是主要組織者，《國安法》後也如「共產」般，不比其他人有更大話語權。但法官則質疑，戴當時態度似乎是「我退出，但如你們想繼續，隨便」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉最後指，辯方提倡的部分論點並不被法庭接納，或需召開紐頓聆訊處理，黃表示並非挑戰任何法庭裁斷，如有不一致的地方，辯方會接受法庭裁斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指涉暴力推翻政府等方屬重行罪大&quot;&gt;辯方指涉暴力推翻政府等方屬「重行罪大」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就本案量刑，辯方認為不屬「罪行重大」，指本案不涉任何暴力行為，被告僅運用當時認為合法的憲制權力，亦有證據非民主派對否決預算案是否違法存疑。黃指，戴耀廷並非為了私利，而是爭取《基本法》訂明的普選，即使謀劃成功，亦不致推翻政府、全盤陷入混亂，因《基本法》有機制解決，最終交由選民決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，或許罪行不是最嚴重，但不代表不屬「重行罪大」。黃則回應，顛覆罪設三級刑期，認為涉暴力推翻政府、造成徹底混亂等情況，才屬「首要分子或罪行重大」的情況，本案情況不足以構成最重罪責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃指，其他量刑因素，包括戴耀廷及時認罪，可扣減三分一。針對23條生效後，除非懲教信納「不會不利國家安全」，否則國安法囚犯不得獲行為良好三分一扣減，法官李運騰則指，法庭判刑時不會考慮懲教署的評估。黃亦確認，戴是涉佔領中環串謀公眾妨擾案保釋候上訴期間干犯本案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃繼明於早上完成陳詞，為戴申請下午及餘下的求情聆訊不出庭，獲法官批准。散庭時，鄒家成與戴耀廷交談，戴搖頭，戴其後隔着玻璃與律師交談，做OK手勢，其後徑直步入囚室。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，共45人罪成。被控方指為組織者的戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及吳政亨5人，今（26日）續求情。3名從犯證人區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟先後求情，辯方基於區和鍾認罪和協助控方案情，主張減刑一半。法官李運騰指，辯方或會指沒有區的證供，控方案情甚至不能成立，並問辯方會否要求更多扣減，區諾軒做交叉手勢，辯方亦稱無相關指示、區非「超級金手指」，但最終同意倡減刑50至60%。趙家賢一方則指趙盡所能協助控方，最多可獲「超級金手指」的66%減刑，法官表明不同意，質疑只適用於需承受風險作供的人，趙終改為要求減刑40%至55%。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒求減刑一半-官問要否增加減刑幅度&quot;&gt;區諾軒求減刑一半 官問要否增加減刑幅度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表戴耀廷的代表大律師黃繼明上午陳詞完畢，下午先由代表區諾軒和鍾錦麟的陳慕賢陳詞。陳指，區諾軒在《國安法》後曾採取數項措施減輕犯罪情況，包括於中聯辦譴責初選或違法後，曾嘗試與官員對話，並於2020年7月15日在 Facebook 發文宣布退出初選，區亦曾與戴耀廷等人討論，最終成功游說趙家賢於翌日退出。辯方指，由於已沒有組織者，即使其他參與者繼續推動串謀，行為亦不會有效。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰則指，初選於7月11至12日投票，區於7月15日退出，組織者當時已沒有什麼進一步工作可以做。辯方回應，隨著組織者退出「35+計劃」，計劃便不具合法性。李再指，抗爭派被告7月15日在無組織者下舉行記者會，辯方指區當時已退出，不會進一步陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續同意，主要減刑因素是區及時認罪，及協助控方案情，亦同意依賴區當時相信謀劃不違法。法官李運騰直言，辯方或許會說「沒有區的協助，控方案情甚至不可能成立」。官再追問，區就《國安法》刑期分級制是否適用於本案有何立場，辯方表示態度中立，但同意若有助區會採納。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指區非超級金手指&quot;&gt;辯方指區非「超級金手指」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉追問，區諾軒一方是否要求法庭給予一半刑期扣減，陳慕賢確認。法官李運騰問，認罪及協助控方作供一般可減刑一半，辯方會要求更多扣減嗎？陳否認，區諾軒亦在位置上雙手打交叉示意。李指這似乎與區的指示不一致，問辯方需否向坐在被告欄的區索取指示，陳其後表示，「那我可能要求減刑60%」，區諾軒笑着搖頭，延伸庭被告亦不禁發笑，議論紛紛。法官李運騰指辯方需提供基礎，陳慶偉則打趣問，「為何不減刑90%？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，若被告屬「超級金手指（Supergrass）」，可減刑三分之二，辯方是指區為「超級金手指」嗎？辯方指留待法庭考慮，陳慶偉着她今晚想想。不過臨散庭前，陳慕賢更改說法，望法庭採用呂世瑜案所訂下的量刑5步驟，並基於《國安法》33條，降低區的刑期等級，而若該條文不適用，則按普通法原則減刑50%至60%。陳並指沒有獲指示區屬「超級金手指」，她說罷轉身望向區，區用力點頭，又雙手抱拳。區的求情約十數分鐘。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾錦麟同要求減刑50-官明言證供相較區諾軒沒那麼有用&quot;&gt;鍾錦麟同要求減刑50% 官明言證供相較區諾軒沒那麼有用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟同樣由大律師陳慕賢代表，求情約6分鐘完成。法官陳慶偉明言，認為鍾的證供沒有區諾軒的證供那麼有用。陳解釋，這是由於鍾的參與程度有限，但他已盡所能協助控方，其證供亦加強了控方案情，因此要求法庭減刑一半。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳其後再次提到，區諾軒和鍾錦麟均已盡力（done everything they could do），法官陳慶偉指那並非好的論點，指減刑是基於證供是否有用，而非被告是否盡力。李運騰又再稱，辯方或說「沒有區諾軒的證供，控方基本上不會有他們的案情（“Without his evidence, prosecution simply does not have his case.”）」。正庭被告欄傳來「yes」，區諾軒則向法官和鄒家成雙手打交叉，又一度與鄒家成隔空交談，並不住搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢一度要求減刑三分二&quot;&gt;趙家賢一度要求減刑三分二&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第三被告趙家賢的大律師利琛，則要求法庭考慮趙盡所能為控方提供資料，屬「超級金手指」，可減刑66%。法官陳慶偉聞言即指趙不是，李運騰亦指，不單只要在庭上作供，還要承受個人風險才屬「超級金手指」，而趙不屬這情況。辯方遂改為要求減刑40至55%。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，作為民主動力召集人的趙家賢於2020年5月才受邀加入初選計劃，直至7月16日退出，並只是負責協助初選行政和執行的工作，例如草擬提名表格、設立票站等。辯方亦認為《國安法》第33條適用，指趙於7月中已退出，並上庭作供，為控方提供新而有用的資訊，符合「揭發他人犯罪行為」，認為法庭可歸納趙為「積極參與者」中較高的量刑，再作減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 趙家賢（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭李運騰問到，辯方會否依賴趙真誠誤信當時行為並非違法，辯方指趙供稱他在較後期階段加入初選，承認對「攬炒」等概念知情，會接受法庭對其罪責的判斷。法官陳慶偉則指，有證供稱趙於較早階段加入初選，他在謀劃的參與不如辯方聲稱的短，利琛表示同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢求情提及2019年太古城遭咬耳-法官質疑與案無關&quot;&gt;趙家賢求情提及2019年太古城遭咬耳 法官質疑與案無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡其後主動表示，辯方的求情陳詞提及趙於2019年在太古城受襲一事，問辯方有何用意。翻查資料，趙當時被咬掉耳朵。辯方解釋，望指出趙多年來為溫和民主派，而他在事件遭受嚴重身體傷害，身心皆受創。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰質疑趙的受害人創傷報告可以如何協助求情。辯方指是顯示趙自2019年經歷多重困難。李官打斷稱與本案無關，辯方指只是想向法庭交代一般背景。李再問辯方是否想基於趙身體狀況令他坐監承受更多苦楚，而要求法庭減刑，辯方否認。趙的求情陳詞歷時約13分鐘。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/D771Zkf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，共45人罪成。被控方指為組織者的戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及吳政亨5人，今（26日）續求情。代表吳政亨的大律師石書銘表示，吳在本案僅輔助角色，他從未倡否決預算案，亦真誠相信戴耀廷稱否決預算案不違法，屬判監3年以下的「其他參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石又於庭上讀出吳政亨親撰的英文求情信，吳稱一直堅信自由民主原則，認為社會分歧需通過文明民主方式處理，而公平公正選舉最能有效防止暴政出現。吳一直對民主陣營持續內鬥痛心，認為處理的最佳方法是初選，因此對初選「無限嚮往」，亦立下決心要盡一分力，發起「三投三不投」聯署。吳自言在整個初選中，從頭到尾都是一個「局外人」，故當控方指控他是本案組織者時「我感到非常驚訝」，並強調由始至終「我支持初選從來都僅是為了初選本身」，與承諾否決預算案無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5人今完成求情，下周二（7月2日）將處理第二批被告求情，為6名港島初選參與者：袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、鄭達鴻、徐子見、楊雪盈及彭卓棋，料需時2天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方吳政亨非組織者從未倡否決預算案&quot;&gt;辯方：吳政亨非組織者、從未倡否決預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟今相繼完成陳詞，最後一位求情為吳政亨。代表吳的大律師石書銘指，雖然控方指稱吳為組織者之一，但隨着案中證據披露（transpire），可見吳不僅不是「組織者」，甚至不是「積極參與者」。石指，吳從一開始就是自行發起「三投三不投」計劃，過程中除了戴耀廷外沒有與其他被告溝通，其角色僅屬輔助（auxillary）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LAZlXmZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
▲ 吳政亨（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石又指，與其他被告不同，吳從未提倡否決預算案，其關注點從來在於初選及爭取35+，甚至曾於電郵表示拒絕將否決預算案納入「三投三不投」；即使法庭裁定戴耀廷曾與吳政亨溝通，判刑時亦不能假設二人討論的深入程度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，吳政亨至少對涉案串謀知情，石同意，但重申不能確定他的參與程度。法官陳慶偉即指，吳政亨曾花大量金錢在《蘋果日報》登頭版廣告宣傳初選，法官李運騰亦指，吳是望確保「35+」成功。石回應，15萬元廣告費算合理，而且當時社會熱切討論否決預算案，但吳的廣告只是呼籲投票予支持初選的候選人，吳的關注點仍是在初選，並止於希望35+成功，而非進一步無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳求情信堅信自由民主原則權力互相制衡&quot;&gt;吳求情信：堅信自由民主原則、權力互相制衡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘續讀出吳的求情信英文版本，當中吳稱自13歲隨家人移民至澳洲，先後於當地的新南威爾斯大學獲得理學學士（主修數學）及商學碩士（主修精算）學位，並自言：「於成長過程中，我不算太熱衷政治」，但是他一直堅信自由民主原則，亦確信權力互相制衡的社會價值。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2zxyrW2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
▲ 吳政亨（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳認為，需要通過文明及民主方式去處理社會內部的分歧，由於「權力使人腐敗，絕對權力則使人絕對腐敗」，他相信定期舉行公平公正的選舉，最能有效制衡權力，減少權力成為暴政的可能性，所以他支持香港的民主運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳香港選舉制度對民主派不利-需妥善處理內部矛盾&quot;&gt;吳：香港選舉制度對民主派不利 需妥善處理內部矛盾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳指，如民主派能在特首選舉獲勝，配合取得立法會過半數議席，就可以組建一個真正的執政聯盟，取得管治權。可是民主派面對巨大的障礙，因香港的選舉制度對民主派極為不利，導致他們過去未能憑藉選票優勢，贏得上述兩場選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳又指，一直為民主陣營內的持續鬥爭痛心，認為須妥善處理民主派的內部矛盾，而最佳方法是通過文明而民主的程序去解決，亦即是通過民主派的內部初選，因此他對初選產生「無限嚮往」，亦立下決心，「必須為實現這夢想盡一分力。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳自言無名氏-對控方指控為組織者感驚訝&quot;&gt;吳自言「無名氏」 對控方指控為組織者感驚訝&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳表示，儘管他「在政圈內是一個完完全全的無名氏」，但是他相信自己有權利和義務去為初選出一分力，因此發起「三投三不投」聯署。吳自言：「在整個初選過程中，從頭到尾我都是一個局外人」，包括沒有參與組織「35+計劃」、沒有參與協調會議，亦沒有在初選中參選。「因此，當控方指控我是本案的組織者之一時，我感到非常驚訝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳表示，由始至終，他支持初選，與承諾否決財政預算案與否並無關係，「我支持初選從來都僅是為了初選本身，與其他事宜無關」。他最後稱：「我相信法治是自由民主制度不可或缺的一部份，只有當合理的法例被制定，而這些法例被尊重和公正地執行，一個社會才有繁榮的希望。」（求情信英文全文及中文翻譯見文末）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方不能怪責吳政亨信戴耀廷稱初選合法&quot;&gt;辯方：不能怪責吳政亨信戴耀廷稱初選合法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘續表示，從吳政亨的公開發言和電郵，他只是「局外人」，因其個人想法而發起「三投三不投」和推動初選，並像很多同案被告一樣，依賴戴耀廷指初選和否決財案不違法的分析，愚蠢地沒有意識到《國安法》的嚴重性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石續指，《國安法》是非常新的罪行，有人對此或持保守立場，有人則較有希望，「但我們當時都是在嘗試在黑暗中找到出路，包括吳政亨。」他又指，法律意見可能是錯誤，吳政亨亦要為此承受責任，但不能怪責吳政亨或其他被告，當時相信一名顯然具資格提供意見的人，正如律師不能怪責當事人依賴自己取得最終可能錯誤的法律意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，無論如何，吳政亨冒了犯法的風險，便須承擔後果，石同意，指因此吳坐在法官席前候判，只是希望法庭寬大處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方吳政亨為其他參加者&quot;&gt;辯方：吳政亨為「其他參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石續指，望法庭考慮吳真誠誤信謀劃為合法而作出減刑，並指吳在刑期三級制下屬「其他參加者」。石又引顛覆罪的條文，列明顛覆行為包括推翻中國根本制度、推翻中央或香港特區政權機關等，認為相關行為才算「罪行重大」，而本案則涉非暴力手段。法官陳仲衡一度指，非暴力手段可以比暴力手段更有效，惟石認為也要考慮後果，本案所涉嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞政權機關履行職能的行為，或不涉人命傷亡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石總結，吳雖對涉案串謀知情，但沒有參與協調會議或實際參與組織謀劃，亦沒有參選，更不會投票否決預算案，望法庭裁定他最多只是「其他參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳政亨求情信英文全文&quot;&gt;吳政亨求情信英文全文：&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the trial I was referred to as D5 and also my alias Lee Bak Loh. I wish to tell the Court who I am, what brought me into this arena of civil and political participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was born in Hong Kong in the year 1978, and migrated to Australia with my parents at the age of 13. While I was there, I graduated with the Bachelor of Science (majoring in Mathematics) and the Master of Commerce (majoring in Actuarial Studies) degrees, both from the University of New South Wales (UNSW). After graduation, I entered the financial industry. I worked in the industry, first in Australia and later in Hong Kong, for more than a decade. At no point in my life did I have affiliation with any political parties, nor did I run in any elections. I have no previous criminal records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I was never too engaged in the world of politics, as I rarely had strong opinions regarding the specifics of policies one way or another. However, I have always strongly believed in the principles of liberal democracy, and the values of checks and balances in a society. Because in any community, there will always be differences in opinions among its members, and that these differences often need to be resolved before the said community can florish. It is much preferable if these differences were resolved through civilised and democratic means, rather than through violence or oppressions. Also, because “Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely”, I believe that the holding of fair and regular elections provides the best counter balance against a power potentially becoming tyrannical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is for these reasons that I support the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, as I believe their cause of striving for democracy a noble one, and also a sensible one for the continued development of this city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was obvious to me that if the pro-democracy camp could obtain a majority in the LegCo and achieved a peaceful transfer of legislative power, it would be a huge step forward for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. This would mean that for any ordinary government bill, after examining its contents, the pro-democracy camp could choose to accept or reject it as they saw fit. This in itself would be an awesome power that they never possessed in the HKSAR’s history. If the pro-democracy camp could manage to win the Chief Executive Election as well alongside a majority in the LegCo, they could then secure a true governing coalition, and this could change the democratic landscape in Hong Kong for good, and I believe for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although clearly, there were huge obstacles to overcome before the pro-democracy camp could win either of these two elections. For one, the Hong Kong electoral system significantly disadvantaged the pro-democracy camp, and this was obviously the main reason why they could not translate their dominance in the popular votes into winning either of these two elections in the past. Yet, I thought the pro-democracy camp as a whole shouldered part of the blame as well. For too long, I had been dismayed at the continuous infighting within the pro-democracy camp, which contributed to their repeated underperformances in the elections. For the movement to proceed forward, these internal differences needed to be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I explained earlier, I thought the best way to resolve such differences would be through a civilised and democratic process, and this meant a primary election within the pro-democracy camp. Once the internal differences were suitably dealt with, and unity was achieved, I thought much was possible afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was through this reasoning that I developed a passion for such a primary election. It was also clear to me that such primary election for the LegCo General Election would be very difficult to bring to fruition, evidenced by the fact that such primary election had never been successfully held in Hong Kong before the material time. I endeavoured to do my utmost to help make this pipedream into a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was, however, a glaring problem in my quest: I was a nobody in the political world. I had absolutely no name recognition among the public, nor among the political operators. This was made obvious by the fact that none of my co-defendants who gave evidence in Court knew who I was when asked. It was highly unlikely that I could make much of an impact in my endeavour. Yet, part of the beauty about democracy is that, in an election, no matter what a person’s status is, the person’s vote still counts as one vote, no more, no less. It is the voter’s right and possibly even the voter’s duty, to contribute a vote towards the total vote count, no matter how limited that contribution might be. Similarly, even though I was a complete outsider to the political world, I considered it my right, and possibly even my duty, to do something to increase the chance of a successful primary election, even if my contribution were going to be infinitesimal. It was with this mindset, that I launched the “Say No to Primary Dodgers” Campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the whole process, I remained an outsider. As the Court had judged and I agreed, I did not take part in the organisation of this “Project 35+”, or any of the coordination meetings, and that I was not a candidate. That’s why I was so surprised when the prosecution accused me of being one of the organisers in this case. My relationship with D1 Prof. Benny Tai was actually more akin to the one that a lobbying group had with a policy maker, in which the lobbying effort was largely ignored. One of my main advocacies was for the participants to treat the Primary Election’s results as final, eg, since they could only realistically target three seats in the Kowloon East Constituency, in my opinion, they should allow only three primary victors there. Instead, the organisers insisted on allowing five victors in the said constituency, and planned to have a second race based on opinion polls right before the General Election. This, in my opinion, would defeat the whole purpose of having a primary election in the first place. I made repeated protestations about this to the organisers and the candidates (including the public letter forwarded by D1 to the candidates on the 20th May 2020), yet I was unable to change anything on that front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that among my advocacies, asking the candidates to promise to veto the Budget was never one of them. In fact, such notion never entered my mind until it became an issue in the public sphere, and it was most definitely not my original reason for supporting a primary election and launching my Campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have explained earlier, I considered the benefits of the pro-democracy camp achieving a majority in the LegCo quite obvious by itself, so I never thought this additional condition was necessary, nor did I think it was even desirable to a certain extent. Since I feared that this issue would be a potentially divisive one among the pro-democracy candidates, and one that could threaten the success of a primary election being held. While I expressed delight when I thought that the candidates had reached a consensus, I explicitly stated that the exact wordings of the consensus didn’t matter. Because what delighted me was the fact that they managed to reach a consensus, which allowed a primary to go ahead, rather than the contents of the consensus themselves. It was also why, when later on I realised that some candidates had refused to sign a promise to veto the Budget, contradicting a previous claim that all of them would sign such promise, I urged people to put that issue aside and to focus on completing the primary first. Because all along, my support for a primary election never hinged on whether it was attached with a promise to veto the Budget or not. My support for a primary election had always been for itself, and itself only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, it should be noted that I had done my utmost to ensure my Campaign complied with the laws, whether they be the Election (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance, the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance, or any others. I believe that the rule of law is an essential part of any liberal democracy. It is only when reasonable laws are enacted, and that these laws are respected and justly enforced, that a society can hope to prosper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I urge the Court to consider the aforementioned factors when determining my sentencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;求情信中文翻譯全文轉載自吳政亨李伯盧關注組&quot;&gt;求情信中文翻譯全文（轉載自吳政亨（李伯盧）關注組）：&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在整個審訊中，我被稱為第五被告或李伯盧(我的筆名)。我希望告訴法庭我的個人背景，以及我如何踏進公民和政治運動這個領域。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我於1978年在香港出生，13歲時隨父母移民澳洲。我在當地的新南威爾斯大學(UNSW)獲得理學學士（主修數學）及商學碩士（主修精算）學位。畢業後，我投身金融行業，並先後在澳洲及香港金融機構工作超過十年。我一生中從未與任何政黨有政治聯繫，亦從未於任何選舉參與競選。我以前没有任何案底。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於成長過程中，我不算太熱衷政治，因為我對政策的細節很少持強烈意見。然而，我一直堅信自由民主原則，亦確信權力互相制衡的社會價值，因為無論在任何體制中，成員總會在某些議題上持不同意見，而通常需要先處理這些分歧，才能使該群體得以蓬勃發展。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我認為，通過文明及民主方式去處理這些分歧，總好過以暴力或鎮壓手段去解決。而由於「權力使人腐敗，絕對權力則使人絕對腐敗」，我相信定期舉行公平公正的選舉，最能有效制衡權力，減少權力成為暴政的可能性。正因如此，我支持香港的民主運動，因我相信他們對民主的追求是一個高尚目標，同時，為著這城市的持續發展，它(對民主的追求)亦是一個理性的目標。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對我而言，明顯地，若然民主陣營能夠在立法會選舉中取得過半議席，並實現立法權力的和平轉移，這將會是香港民主運動的一大進步。這意味在任何一般政府議案上，民主陣營在審查其內容後，可以按他們的判斷選擇通過或否決該議案。這是民主陣營在香港特別行政區史上，從未擁有過的重大權力。如果民主陣營能在行政長官選舉上同時獲勝，配合立法會內的過半議席，就可以組建一個真正的執政聯盟，取得管治權。這將對香港的民主格局產生永久性影響，我亦相信這將會是正面的影響。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;然而，在民主陣營能夠贏得兩項選舉其中任何一項之前，顯然還有巨大的障礙需要克服。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首先，香港的選舉制度對民主陣營極為不利，這絕對是民主陣營過去未能憑藉選票優勢，贏得這兩場選舉的最主要原因。但我認為民主陣營總體來說，亦需為他們的落敗承擔某程度上的責任。
在過去一段太長的時間，我都一直為民主陣營內的持續內鬥痛心，這內鬥一直令民主陣營在選舉上，屢屢無法發揮最佳表現。而為了香港民主運動的前景，這些內部矛盾必須妥善處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;如前所述，我認為處理這內部矛盾的最佳方法是通過文明而民主的程序去解決，亦即是通過民主陣營的內部初選。當這些內部矛盾得到妥善處理，而民主陣營內一眾人士能齊心向前，我認為再困難的目標都有達成的可能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;基於這個心路歷程，我對以上所形容的初選產生無限嚮往。但我亦明白，針對立法會大選的全民主陣營初選極難實行，觀乎在案發之前，此類初選從未能成功舉辦過，它的難度由此可見一斑。於是我立下決心，必須為實現這夢想盡一分力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;然而，即使我希望出一分力，也要面對一個明顯的障礙—我在政圈內是一個完完全全的無名氏。無論在公眾層面、政圈中人眼中，我都沒有任何知名度。從本案所有上庭作供的同案被告作證時，被問及有關本人的事情，都表示在案發時不認識我，這明顯地證明了上述說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;以我的身份，對於在實現初選的過程中，能夠產生任何實質影響力的機會極微。不過，民主的其中一個可敬之處，就是在選舉中，無論投票者的身位地位如何，那一票都是算作一票，不多也不少。即使每一票的實質影響力有限，每一個選民都有權利，甚或可能是有義務，去貢獻這神聖一票。同樣地，儘管我在政治世界中完全是局外人，可以做到的是多麼的微不足道，我相信我有權利，甚至可能是我有義務，去為初選出一分力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而我正正是抱着如此信念去發起「三投三不投」聯署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在整個初選過程中，從頭到尾我都是一個局外人。正如法庭判詞所指、而我亦同意，我沒有參予組織「35+計劃」、沒有參予協調會議，亦沒有在初選中參選。因此，當控方指控我是本案的組織者之一時，我感到非常驚訝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我與第一被告戴耀庭教授的關係，實際上更像一個被無視的遊說團體與決策組織的關係。我其中一個主要倡議是「應將初選結果視為最終結果」。以九龍東選區為例，由於民主陣營在大選時，實際上最多只可望獲得三席，因此我認為初選時該區只應有三個優勝名單。可是，組織者堅持允許該選區有五個優勝名單，並計劃在大選前再以民調作第二輪競賽。對我而言，這做法與初選的意義背道而馳，我為此多次向組織者及參選人提出抗議（包括第一被告於2020年5月20日向參選人轉發的公開信），但我無法在此帶出任何改變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;值得注意的是，在我的倡議中，要求參選人承諾否決財政預案從來都不是其中之一。說實在，在這成為公眾議題之前，我根本從來沒有這個想法，這亦絕對不是我當初支持初選及發起聯署的原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;正如前文所說，我認為民主陣營獲得立去會過半議席，本身已是足夠明顯的好處，所以我從沒有想過需要更多額外條件。在某程度上，我甚至不認為這額外條件可取。因為我害怕這議題可能會在民主陣營參選人當中引發爭議，從而威脅到初選的實現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當我認為參選人同意「共同綱領」時，我表示高興，但亦有明確表明我認為「協調成功」四字已是大快人心，根本無需看細節。因為令我高興的是參選人終於達到共識，令初選能夠順利舉行，而不是共識的內容本身。這亦解釋了當我之後得知「某些初選參選人拒絕簽署承諾否決財政預算案」，發現與之前「所有參選人都願意簽署」這一說法有所出入時，我懇求大家將這爭議放一旁，希望大家先聚焦於完成初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;因為由始至終，我支持初選從來無關承諾否決財政預算案與否—我支持初選從來都僅是為了初選本身，與其他事宜無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最後值得留意的是，我一直盡我所能去確保「三投三不投」團隊遵守所有法律，無論是《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》、《預防及控制疾病條例》或其他任何法律。我相信法治是自由民主制度不可或缺的一部份。只有當合理的法例被制定，而這些法例被尊重和公正地執行，一個社會才有繁榮的希望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我懇求法庭於決定本人刑期時考慮以上所述因素。&lt;/p&gt;

But what security role should Washington seek from its European allies in the region?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has long sought to focus Europe’s attention on the rising challenge posed by China in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. This effort began with a social media post before the administration even took office, when incoming national security advisor Jake Sullivan expressed concern over an EU-China investment agreement in December 2020. A few months later, Secretary of State Antony Blinken mentioned China 11 times in a speech at NATO headquarters about efforts to shape American alliances; he mentioned Russia only four. On a range of fronts and through multiple vehicles, including the Group of Seven (G7), Washington has worked with European and Indo-Pacific partners to build an agenda to reduce critical dependencies on China and build the capacity to resist economic coercion. However, despite Washington’s pressure on Europe to focus on China’s economic challenge, it has been less clear what the United States seeks from Europe militarily in the Indo-Pacific region — other than “more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. engagement has been effective in aligning European perspectives and approaches to the region. China is now a major focus of transatlantic discussions and European countries have prioritized developing a common approach. Although the shift is uneven, from London to Berlin to Rome most European capitals are adopting a tougher approach to managing the economic relationship with China — as shown by the European Union’s ongoing investigations into potential Chinese dumping of electric vehicles, medical devices, and solar panels. European countries are also deepening engagement with Indo-Pacific partners on issues related to economic security. Japan and the European Union are cooperating to promote supply chain resilience in critical sectors like semiconductors, for example, in a shared effort to reduce dependence on China — a dialogue that is more advanced than it is with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the picture is less clear on defense and security issues, with little consensus or focus on how Europe should deepen its engagement with countries in the Indo-Pacific. The leaders of several close U.S. allies and partners in the region — Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea — have begun regular participation in the annual NATO summit, a significant development pushed by the Biden administration. But the ultimate purpose of this engagement remains unclear, and other steps — such as the purported plans to establish a NATO office in Tokyo in 2023 — have proven controversial and were opposed by several member states. The United Kingdom, through the AUKUS partnership with Australia and the United States and the Global Combat Aircraft Program (GCAP) with Japan, has stepped up engagement with Indo-Pacific partners. Yet other instances of defense engagement by European countries in the region have been mostly ad hoc and symbolic, such as the passing exercises with Asian partners through the European Union’s Operation ATALANTA, including with the Pakistani navy in June 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This picture of unfocused engagement and occasional mixed messages begs the question: What security role should the United States seek for Europe in the Indo-Pacific? Can European partners make a meaningful contribution to deterrence and contingency response in the region, and if so, how? Are the potential benefits of enhanced engagement worth the cost, given the ongoing war in Ukraine and the security needs of Europe? And more broadly, how should Europe engage the Indo-Pacific on defense and security issues?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report aims to address these questions. It finds that Europe has a significant interest in upholding a free and open Indo-Pacific and can contribute to regional security in targeted ways. The deepening cooperation and engagement between Moscow and Beijing underscores that security in Europe and the Indo-Pacific are linked — a reality that South Korea and Japan have clearly recognized through their strong support for Ukraine. In principle, a deeper European role in Indo-Pacific security would therefore be a welcome development and should be encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Europe’s role in the region in the near term is constrained by its limited military means and by the direct and intensifying challenge posed by Russia. Europe’s priority should therefore be to ensure its own security in the face of the Russian threat, and to build the capacity to enable the United States to shift focus and respond effectively in the event of a military contingency or crisis with China. The driving focus of European defense planning and procurement should be ensuring that Europeans can provide more for their own security at a time when U.S. military capabilities are needed elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the need for Europe to focus on ensuring its own security does not make countries in the region irrelevant to security in the Indo-Pacific. Indeed, in addition to Europe’s extensive economic and diplomatic ties, European countries — particularly the United Kingdom and France — have important military resources, including space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and cyber capabilities, that can supplement those of the United States and Indo-Pacific allies on the margins. A revived European defense industrial base could provide a vital boost to global defense materiel production and increase the credibility of U.S. alliances globally. European arms sales and security assistance could also directly support capacity building among allies and partners in the region. Finally, the maintenance of a European defense presence in the region, however modest and if employed with purpose, can reinforce international law and send an important signal to China about the potential costs of aggression, particularly if that presence is linked to the European Union’s economic strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The driving focus of European defense planning and procurement should be ensuring that Europeans can provide more for their own security at a time when U.S. military capabilities are needed elsewhere.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the longer term, the United States should seek to provide pathways for an expanded European role. European rearmament is underway, meaning that where Europe is today does not reflect where it will be in 5 to 10 years. Thus, Europe may be able to contribute much more over time to Indo-Pacific security, as its capacity grows and if the Russian threat recedes. The United States should keep this in mind when considering its longer-term defense planning in the Indo-Pacific and should seek to shape European defense planning and transatlantic defense industrial engagement with an eye toward a potentially larger role in the Indo-Pacific over time. In short, encouraging and incorporating a greater European defense role in the Indo-Pacific should be part of a longer-term strategy toward the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report will first outline Europe’s strategic dilemma, in which it must balance significant interests in a stable Indo-Pacific with the imperative of deterring a revanchist and aggressive Russia on its eastern flank. It will describe the view from the Indo-Pacific, in which a broad demand for more European defense engagement is tempered by a desire to avoid dividing the region into blocs. The report will then explore the potential vehicles for Europe’s military engagement with the Indo-Pacific region and how these relate to U.S. regional interests. Finally, it will provide recommendations for what the United States should seek from its European allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-i&quot;&gt;Part I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;europes-role-in-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;Europe’s Role in the Indo-Pacific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-links&quot;&gt;Economic Links&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s stake in a free and open Indo-Pacific is vast, and a conflict over Taiwan or in the South China Sea would directly impact its security and prosperity. The EU market is roughly equivalent in size to the United States or China, making it a key economic partner with countries throughout the region. Around 40 percent of the European Union’s foreign trade passes through the South China Sea, for example. Between 2011 and 2021, imports from the Indo-Pacific to the European Union increased 64 percent, from €515 billion (about $474 billion) to €844 billion ($776 billion), while exports grew 44 percent, from €407 billion ($374 billion) to €583 billion ($536 billion). The European Union is also the largest investor in the region, which includes four of the bloc’s top global trading partners: China, Japan, South Korea, and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, any action taken by China to seize control of Taiwan or to threaten international maritime traffic in the South China Sea would directly affect European citizens in the region. The Indo-Pacific is home to millions of European citizens, including 1.8 million French and at least 1.7 million British across the region and more than 30,000 Europeans living in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing is keenly aware of the importance of Europe’s market and has consistently sought to undermine efforts within the European Union to forge a common trade and economic policy toward China. As such, China has worked to cultivate relations with individual European countries, most notably Germany, Europe’s economic powerhouse, and Italy, which initially signed on to the Belt and Road Initiative before recently withdrawing. China has also sought to create a new multilateral form of engagement with both EU and non-EU countries in Eastern Europe, called the 17+1, which was a deliberate effort to divide Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, China has sought to target European countries pursuing policies at odds with Beijing’s interests. For example, China imposed severe import restrictions on goods from Lithuania after the Baltic country withdrew from the 17+1 grouping and allowed Taiwan to establish a new trade office in Vilnius. After the Netherlands joined with the United States to restrict exports of high-end semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China, Beijing imposed export controls on critical minerals that are crucial to the European Union’s digital and green transitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union, with the authority to negotiate trade deals, regulate its single market, and impose sanctions, has recently taken the lead in forging a more collective European strategy toward China. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has championed a “de-risking” approach to mitigate critical dependencies and supply chain vulnerabilities, while avoiding the economic damage of a more comprehensive decoupling of trade ties. More broadly, the 2021 EU Strategy for Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific aims at a free and open Indo-Pacific for all while building strong and lasting partnerships in areas including security and defense, ocean governance, and the green transition. To protect individual EU countries vulnerable to economic coercion, Brussels also created a new anti-coercion instrument that could allow the European Union to impose trade restrictions, such as higher import tariffs or limited access to EU public tenders. The European Union also passed a Critical Raw Materials Act specifically to reduce its reliance on China for key inputs to Europe’s manufacturing base for electric vehicles, wind turbines, and other green goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-ties&quot;&gt;Defense Ties&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Militarily, European countries have significant capabilities that in theory could be valuable in the event of an Indo-Pacific contingency. For example, European countries collectively possess 116 large naval surface combatants and 66 submarines as of 2021. Despite significant gaps compared to its U.S. ally, European forces also possess air enabling capabilities, including roughly 35 command and control (C2) platforms, about 150 air-to-air refueling aircraft, a few dozen reconnaissance aircraft, and roughly 200 uncrewed aerial vehicles. European states collectively possess sizeable fleets of fifth-generation fighter jets, which could augment American air power. Europe’s defense industrial capacity is also ramping up following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two European countries, France and the United Kingdom, operate regularly in the Indo-Pacific region and maintain significant capabilities there. France has long been Europe’s most prominent actor in the region, through its overseas territories, permanent forces in both the Indian and Pacific oceans, regular multipurpose deployments, and strong cooperation and arms sales with strategic partners, including India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, and Singapore. France has 7,000 permanently stationed personnel (4,100 across the United Arab Emirates, Djibouti, and La Réunion and Mayotte Islands in the Indian Ocean and 2,900 across New Caledonia and French Polynesia in the Pacific Ocean) with substantial capabilities, including fighter jets, surveillance frigates, and tactical transport aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom also plays a significant role in the region. As then foreign secretary Boris Johnson declared in 2016: “Britain is back east of Suez.” Although the United Kingdom’s current military assets in the region are limited, London has prioritized engagement with the region through several long-term military agreements. Its participation in the AUKUS initiative will see it increase its military role, such as through presence in the Submarine Rotational Force-West out of Australia. Additionally, during then defense secretary Ben Wallace’s visit to Japan in 2021, the United Kingdom announced that it would permanently deploy two patrol vessels to the region, now hosted in Singapore. This followed the deployment of a carrier strike group to the region led by the HMS Queen Elizabeth which included U.S. and Dutch warships, designed to demonstrate freedom of navigation rights under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The deployment included joint exercises with Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Singapore under the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) established in 1971. Britain also concluded a Reciprocal Access Agreement with Japan in 2023 and has committed to a regular trilateral exercise with Japan and the United States beginning in 2025. And as noted, the United Kingdom is working with Italy and Japan under the GCAP program to develop a sixth-generation stealth fighter jet by 2035. For both France and the United Kingdom, European security remains the priority focus — but both have stepped up in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, a broader range of European countries has undertaken episodic long-distance deployments in the area. Following the release of the European Union’s 2021 Indo-Pacific strategy, Germany and the Netherlands deployed military vessels to the region for the first time. German defense minister Boris Pistorius described the Indo-Pacific as “the most strategically important region on Earth,” in which “decisions about freedom, peace, and prosperity in the world are made.” Aircraft from Germany, France, and Spain — together representing the trinational Future Combat Air System, expected to reach full operational capacity by 2040 — will depart on a major exercise tour across the Asia-Pacific in mid-2024 to deepen ties with regional partners. Italy is also ramping up its Indo-Pacific engagement, with plans to send its carrier strike group to the Rim of the Pacific exercise in June–July 2024. These deployments send a message by the participants that they reject China’s maritime claims, they are committed to upholding UNCLOS, and there will be costs to future aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this increased military activity by European states sends a useful message to Beijing, what does it say about Europe’s potential role in a regional contingency? Some scholars contend that European states have critical capabilities that could be brought to bear in the defense of Taiwan and should be the focus of concrete military planning. For example, Luis Simón, Daniel Fiott, and Octavian Manea argue that “Europeans can play a strategically meaningful military contribution in the Indo-Pacific, both in peacetime and wartime. The subsurface domain would be particularly critical in any Indo-Pacific contingency, and the combined UK and French subsurface nuclear (SSN) force would constitute around 15–20 percent of the U.S. one, and far above anything U.S. regional allies may be in a position to bring to bear within the next decade at least.” After China carried out live-fire exercises surrounding Taiwan in July 2022, Admiral Pierre Vandier, former head of the French navy, noted that “against the Chinese navy, we will win if we fight together, in coalition” during a hearing in the French parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet U.S. military leaders planning and preparing for a possible conflict over Taiwan are focused almost exclusively on the role of allies who would be close to the fight. Although South Korea, Japan, Australia, and the Philippines would all be directly impacted by a conflict, the degree to which Washington can rely on even them to support U.S. military operations remains open to question. This uncertainty complicates U.S. military planning in a region that lacks a multilateral alliance structure with a unified chain of command. Attempting to comprehensively incorporate European partners, whose willingness and ability to contribute is even less certain, into U.S. military planning for a conflict over Taiwan has therefore not been a U.S. priority. In sum, Europe’s growing defense engagement in the region is useful from a messaging standpoint but will do little to reinforce deterrence or contribute if it remains episodic and unconnected to concrete contingency planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In sum, Europe’s growing defense engagement in the region is useful from a messaging standpoint but will do little to reinforce deterrence or contribute if it remains episodic and unconnected to concrete contingency planning.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-view-from-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;The View from the Indo-Pacific&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For their part, all major U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific are pursuing deeper security engagement with European partners, as part of a larger strategy that acknowledges the linkages between security in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s December 2022 National Defense Strategy, for example, states, “With partners like the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy, Japan will mutually reinforce involvement in global security issues as well as challenges in Europe and Indo-Pacific.” In an opinion piece published in 2023, then foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi wrote, “Japan will fundamentally reinforce its defense capabilities and strengthen cooperation with NATO and other like-minded countries, in order to shore up and defend the free and open international order based on the rule of law.” The European Union also maintains a Strategic Partnership Agreement with Japan that spans a wide range of economic and security issues and is arguably the most comprehensive of all European partnerships with Indo-Pacific countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Seoul, the government of President Yoon Suk Yeol has sought to build ties with NATO in part as a response to the UN Security Council’s inability to address North Korean provocations in the face of obstruction by China and Russia since early 2022. Facing this deadlock, South Korea seeks new global governance institutions and partners to address the growing threats from Pyongyang. South Korea’s national security strategy, released in April 2023, states, “The European Union (EU) and European countries share universal values with the Republic of Korea, [and] . . . the Yoon Suk Yeol administration seeks to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with Europe on global issues and build a value-based diplomatic partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia demonstrates a similar approach. Its 2023 Defence Strategic Review notes, “We must also enhance . . . engagements with the E.U., its member countries, and NATO.” The strong support to Ukraine offered by Japan, South Korea, and Australia was aimed at strengthening relations with Europe, with the expectation that Europe would provide similar support in the face of aggression in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, U.S. partners in the Indo-Pacific are at times ambivalent about the proper role of European partners in the region’s security and the best means to operationalize that role. While U.S allies have embraced a closer relationship with NATO outside the region, countries in Southeast Asia and among the Pacific Islands are wary of strengthening formal arrangements that could signal a region dividing into blocs — a sentiment China has actively sought to promote. In response to media reports that NATO was considering opening an office in Tokyo — an initiative that fizzled in the face of backlash from France and in the region — China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson asserted, “NATO’s attempt to make eastward inroads into the Asia-Pacific will inevitably undermine regional peace and stability. The countries and people in this region are on high alert against this and firmly oppose any words or actions designed to bring military blocs into this region and stoke division and confrontation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However far-fetched, these arguments have resonance in parts of the region. In a May 2022 interview, then Singaporean prime minister Lee Hsien Loong commented, “Countries in Asia, many of them enjoy good ties with China, as well as with the US and the US’ treaty allies. . . . I think that is a better configuration than one where countries are divided along a line and one bloc confronts another.” He added, “That is the history in Europe, but it has not been the history in Asia. And I think it is better that it remains not.” In response to the reports about the possibility of a NATO office in Tokyo, an Indonesian diplomat wrote, “NATO has little to contribute toward stability in the Asia-Pacific region . . . bringing NATO to Asia will do more harm than good.” Participants from multiple countries in a CSIS study group voiced similar caution about the downside of deeper NATO engagement in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, while many Indo-Pacific partners — particularly U.S. treaty allies — in principle welcome deeper European defense and security engagement in the region and are pursuing their own deeper ties with NATO, how and where that engagement is executed, and through what structures, matters. This ambivalence serves to reinforce a key point: the concrete benefits to Indo-Pacific security of deeper European engagement — through strategic messaging, contingency planning, or capacity building — must outweigh the downside risk of playing into Chinese narratives on the “NATO-ization” of Asia, particularly in light of the need for Europe to sustain a focus on the security challenge posed by Russia in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The concrete benefits to Indo-Pacific security of deeper European engagement — through strategic messaging, contingency planning, or capacity building — must outweigh the downside risk of playing into Chinese narratives.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-bear-in-the-room-what-would-russia-do&quot;&gt;The Bear in the Room: What Would Russia Do?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dilemma for Europe is that while it does have military capacity that can contribute to deterrence in the Indo-Pacific and can be helpful at the margins in responding to aggression, it also faces a revanchist and irredentist threat from Russia. While Russian president Vladmir Putin will not remain in office indefinitely, as long as Russian foreign policy adheres to its anti-Western and revisionist outlook, Europe will have to remain on guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow would likely see Chinese military aggression as creating opportunities for Russia to exploit. Sino-Russian relations may fall short of an established alliance. But Chinese support for Russia, while perhaps less than what Russia initially hoped for — particularly in terms of direct military assistance — has proven vital to Russia’s war effort by reviving and ramping up Russia’s defense industry. In the event of a conflict over Taiwan, China would have a military interest in encouraging opportunistic aggression from Russia to create dilemmas for the United States in Europe and stretch U.S. forces. Moreover, the Kremlin would be eager to see a U.S. military defeat in the Indo-Pacific and would likely want to challenge or threaten Europe’s security architecture. Moscow is also willing to take risks in its deployment of military force, as demonstrated not just by its invasion of Ukraine, but also in its intervention in Syria, its use of a chemical weapon to assassinate Russian dissidents on UK soil, and the proliferation of Russian “private military contractors” in Africa to support anti-Western military leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the event of a conflict over Taiwan, China would have a military interest in encouraging opportunistic aggression from Russia to create dilemmas for the United States in Europe and stretch U.S. forces.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the potential for Russia to directly threaten European security and NATO would likely increase significantly in the event of a conflict in the Indo-Pacific. For example, in this scenario Russia might be more willing to gamble that the United States would be unable to respond decisively to a lightning attack on the Baltics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-overstretched&quot;&gt;U.S. Overstretched?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an ongoing debate about whether global demands on the U.S. military are overstretching its capabilities, particularly in responding to a conflict over Taiwan. While it is beyond the scope of this report to fully address this debate, it is fair to assume that a potential conflict with China over Taiwan would be all-consuming for the United States. China’s military buildup, including its modern rocket forces, space and cyber capabilities, advanced naval combatants, and large numbers of advanced fighter, bomber, and uncrewed aircraft would pose a major challenge to the United States and its Indo-Pacific allies. The United States would need to guard against the risk of opportunistic aggression within the region as well, as North Korea could seek to exploit a conflict over Taiwan to advance its interests on the Korean Peninsula. Europe and NATO should assume any conflict with China would stretch American military capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States would undoubtedly pull significant military assets out of the European theater to support a major campaign to defend Taiwan. These would likely include aircraft carriers operated by the U.S. Sixth Fleet headquartered at Naval Support Activity Naples and enabling capabilities such as airborne C2 and air-to-air refueling — where Europe lags far behind the United States. Moreover, the war in Ukraine has revealed both the massive quantity of munitions needed in a conventional conflict and Europe’s shockingly limited stockpiles. An Indo-Pacific contingency would consume vast quantities of U.S. munitions and defense materiel to the detriment of Europe, as the United States would be either unable or unwilling to supply considerable munitions to the European forces. As an example, a recent CSIS study found that the United States would likely consume the entirety of its inventory of Long-Range Anti-ship Missiles (LRASM) in a week during a conflict over Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;An Indo-Pacific contingency would consume vast quantities of U.S. munitions and defense materiel to the detriment of Europe, as the United States would be either unable or unwilling to supply considerable munitions to the European forces.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia could seek to take advantage of the shift in U.S. posture. Thus, the prospect of the United States pulling assets out of the European theater makes European participation in an Indo-Pacific contingency potentially challenging given the renewed threat posed by Russia on Europe’s eastern flank and Europe’s limited capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-ii&quot;&gt;Part II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;objectives-for-european-defense-engagement-in-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;Objectives for European Defense Engagement in the Indo-Pacific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main contribution Europe could make to Indo-Pacific security in the short to medium term, given the continuing threat posed by Russia, is to alleviate the demands on U.S. forces by strengthening Europe’s own capacity for its defense at home. This will require significant resources and a change in emphasis of European procurement efforts and in how the United States approaches NATO and European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while Europe’s military focus should be on NATO’s area of responsibility, that does not preclude a European contribution to the Indo-Pacific, particularly over the medium to long term. If Russia is deterred from military action and distracted and consumed by the war in Ukraine, or should a less anti-Western government emerge in Moscow, that may free up important European resources for the Indo-Pacific. As such, while the near-term focus of U.S. efforts should be on encouraging Europeans to build forces to deter Russia, the United States should not preclude European involvement in an Indo-Pacific contingency and should engage European partners in a discussion of requirements during a crisis. Furthermore, over the longer term, a Europe rearmed with capable and ready forces may be able to significantly contribute to security in the Indo-Pacific. That means the United States should seek to deepen European defense engagement with the region and expand the connections of European defense partners with the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) in Hawaii. These efforts should be undertaken bilaterally or with small groups of European partners — and not through NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;europes-core-military-role-cover-the-flanks&quot;&gt;Europe’s Core Military Role: Cover the Flanks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world of rapidly growing Chinese military power in the Indo-Pacific and a proximate Russian threat in Europe, some geographic division of labor between the United States and its European allies is inevitable. Rather than avoid discussion of this reality, the United States and its European allies should acknowledge and explicitly plan for it. Doing so does not mean that the United States should focus solely on security in the Indo-Pacific; the United States can and should sustain a central role in European security for the foreseeable future, even as it dedicates increasing resources to the potential threat posed by China. Nevertheless, it is time for the United States and Europe to engage in a frank dialogue about priorities and trade-offs in U.S. force posture globally, and to prepare European partners for the need to sustain deterrence under conditions that involve a smaller U.S. presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is time for the United States and Europe to engage in a frank dialogue about priorities and trade-offs in U.S. force posture globally, and to prepare European partners for the need to sustain deterrence under conditions that involve a smaller U.S. presence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Washington should press Europe to prepare to deter Russia with less U.S. support.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States has not been frank with its NATO allies about the impact a war in the Indo-Pacific would have on its presence in Europe. The force planning construct underpinning the United States’ 2022 National Defense Strategy assumes a military that is sized to prevail in conflict against a peer competitor — with China identified as the pacing challenge — while employing “a range of risk mitigation efforts” to deter opportunistic aggression elsewhere. However, these statements remained largely undefined, and the reality is that a conflict with China would almost certainly precipitate major adjustments in U.S. force posture globally, including in Europe. The inclination of U.S. officials is to reassure NATO allies of its steadfast commitment to their security, regardless of global conditions, but doing so evades a necessary discussion of how a conflict in Asia would inevitably impact U.S. presence in Europe. In fact, an Indo-Pacific contingency greatly increases the potential for Russian aggression in Europe. This is the scenario that NATO and Europe need to prepare for — one in which Europeans are required to defend themselves while the United States is focused elsewhere. NATO planning must begin to consider the realistic possibility of opportunistic aggression by Russia in the event of a conflict over Taiwan or on the Korean Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States should clarify to NATO allies the impact an Indo-Pacific contingency would have on the European theater.&lt;/strong&gt; Requirements for U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific depend on the scenario, but a significant draw on a range of capabilities — particularly air, naval, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets — would seem nearly certain. It is critical that the United States attempt to give some clarity to NATO in order to provide direction to European procurement and planning efforts. As a general principle, the United States should take steps to be more transparent with European and Indo-Pacific allies about joint strategic planning and information sharing to live up to its commitment to make allies and partners a “center of gravity” in its 2022 National Defense Strategy. This will require a far more forward-leaning approach to information sharing on contingency planning than exists today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;European defense spending should focus on addressing potential gaps left by the United States.&lt;/strong&gt; Defense spending by EU member states increased by 6 percent in 2022 compared to the previous year, reaching a record €240 billion ($260 billion). But European countries are not concentrating their efforts on procuring capabilities that can help mitigate the gaps that would be left by the United States in the event of a crisis elsewhere. U.S. engagement should encourage them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Europe should help secure sea lanes of communication and key maritime choke points.&lt;/strong&gt; As the United States surges naval assets to the Indo-Pacific, Europe could help fill the gap. Simón, Fiott, and Manea argue, “Europeans can contribute by securing the sea lanes of communications in the Indian Ocean, which would be important in an Indo-Pacific contingency, but also in other important areas like space and ammunition, as well as investing in a common pool of inter-theater capabilities.” For instance, five European countries have military bases in Djibouti, as do the United States and China. Securing the entry point into the Indian Ocean from the Red Sea would be an allied priority and could be a focus for European militaries. Additionally, European naval forces could help deter opportunistic aggression from Iran and help ensure trade continues to flow from the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;europeanindo-pacific-security-defense-cooperation-and-engagement&quot;&gt;European–Indo-Pacific Security, Defense Cooperation, and Engagement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as NATO and European states should focus on preparing to defend the continent with less U.S. support, there remain meaningful ways that they can contribute to deterrence and stability in the Indo-Pacific — and over the long term, the potential for significant contribution to security in the region is very real. European engagement in the Indo-Pacific should be targeted, and for the most part executed outside a NATO framework. As such, the United States should consider the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep NATO out of the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/strong&gt; The downside of direct NATO engagement in the Indo-Pacific probably outweighs the benefits. The more than 30 members of NATO hold widely different views of China, a fact that would undermine the alliance’s ability to forge a meaningful agenda for the region. NATO engagement also risks playing into Chinese narratives regarding purported U.S. efforts to divide the world into competing blocs. With the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Europe’s security situation and NATO’s focus has reverted to its original raison d’etre, protecting Europe and deterring Russia. This is where it should remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, bring the Indo-Pacific to NATO instead.&lt;/strong&gt; On the other hand, the growing engagement of Indo-Pacific allies with NATO in Europe should be welcomed and expanded. The attendance of the IP4 countries at NATO summits (Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea) has demonstrated solidarity with Ukraine and support for European security. Indo-Pacific engagement with NATO could be a vehicle for valuable information sharing and exchange on Chinese and Russian threats and help to narrow gaps in perceptions across regions. It could facilitate increased coordination and set common standards for weapons production, such as munitions that could then be used interchangeably among countries. NATO can also provide important lessons learned on opportunities and challenges of coalition warfighting. Engagement could be expanded beyond the IP4 to include other likeminded allies and partners in the region, such as the Philippines and Singapore — should they express interest in joining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on building deeper and denser partnerships between Europe and the Indo-Pacific at the bilateral or “minilateral” level.&lt;/strong&gt; Europe’s direct military engagement with the Indo-Pacific should be primarily done by individual European states. Thus, the United States should support expanded bilateral military-to-military and political-to-military engagement between European and Asian partners and expand efforts to engage and incorporate willing partners into defense planning. Instead of seeking to develop a formal multilateral structure for this engagement, such as a European “Quad” to engage the existing Indo-Pacific Quad (consisting of the United States, Japan, India, and Australia), the United States should encourage more organic cooperation. For instance, along the sidelines of the annual Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, European defense officials could arrange a structured dialogue with their Indo-Pacific counterparts, with or without U.S. participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand coordination and engagement between Europe and INDOPACOM.&lt;/strong&gt; Incorporating a more significant role for Europe militarily in the Indo-Pacific necessitates a greater presence in Hawaii at INDOPACOM. Having a broad and robust global coalition of allies and partners committed to promoting regional stability and potentially joining the war-fighting effort has clear benefits. But a broad coalition can also add complications. Given the stakes of a war in the Indo-Pacific, the emphasis of U.S. war planners will be on what added military value can be brought to bear, as opposed to the diplomatic or optical value of having a large coalition. The United States should focus its engagement on a small subset of European partners who can make a meaningful military contribution during a conflict — in particular the United Kingdom and France — and work to define operational contributions during peacetime and contingencies. However, the United States should not preclude other allies and partners from contributing, especially as European defense capabilities expand in the years ahead. The United States should insist that European countries that wish to engage are prepared to bring real military capabilities and commitments to the table, even if small. Today the only European partners with liaison officers at INDOPACOM are the United Kingdom and France; several others, including Nordic states, have expressed interest. This interest should be encouraged, provided it is accompanied by a willingness to commit resources, however small, to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The United States should focus its engagement on a small subset of European partners who can make a meaningful military contribution during a conflict — in particular the United Kingdom and France — and work to define operational contributions during peacetime and contingencies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foster engagement between states on the Baltic and South China Seas.&lt;/strong&gt; The Baltic and South China Seas have similar operating environments, with relatively shallow bodies of water neighboring revisionist powers who assert unlawful claims, engage in unsafe operational behavior, and threaten maritime neighbors. Nordic navies and coast guards could provide security and capacity-building assistance to the navies and coast guards of maritime Southeast Asia, such as training and equipment transfers. For example, the United States has provided coast guard cutters to Vietnam and the Philippines, which have been refurbished and become important naval vessels; it should encourage states on the Baltic Sea to offer similar capacity-building and training initiatives. Sweden has already participated in such a program through the European Union’s Capacity Building Mission in Somalia, donating vessels to the Somaliland Coast Guard and providing training and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote the development of an EU naval mission in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/strong&gt; Europe’s naval presence in the region is useful in signaling to China that it is not just the United States that is concerned about a free and open Indo-Pacific. But Europe’s naval presence could send a stronger signal if it were more tightly linked to the European Union’s economic clout; after all, it is Brussels that will respond economically in a crisis, as it is responsible for the single market and therefore sanctions. A major purpose of freedom of navigation operations is to convey to China that Europe is both engaged in the region and concerned about Chinese behavior, meaning that action against Taiwan or international shipping will prompt a European response. Since this response is likely to be primarily economic in nature, meaning it would be an EU competency, it makes sense for the European Union to expand its naval efforts into the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has a track record of conducting naval operations in response to regional security threats. These include Operation ATALANTA to counter piracy off the coast of Somalia and the Horn of Africa and Operation IRINI in the Mediterranean to enforce a UN arms embargo to Libya. More recently, the European Union has launched a security and defense partnership with four coastal states by the Gulf of Guinea to mitigate pressure exerted by terrorist groups in the region. To protect cargo ships under attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, the European Union also launched a naval mission in the Red Sea in early 2024, with up to seven member states providing ships or planes. Finally, the European Union’s Coordinated Maritime Presences (CMP) tool enables the bloc to act as one militarily in areas of interest. This is essentially a way to work around the European Union’s inability to operate a formal naval command by establishing a maritime surveillance arm to coordinate air and naval assets, achieving the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union should focus on forging a more cohesive and integrated European approach to the region. This means linking Europe’s significant economic clout and its primary lever to impose costs against China — sanctions — with its diplomatic and military efforts and signaling in the region. The EU role would be to manage and coordinate Europe’s naval presence. For example, regional EU missions could serve as the anchor for a pan-European naval attaché or even as a liaison office for maritime operators. Having EU-flagged vessels traverse the region may also expand the number of EU countries willing to participate, as operating under an EU flag provides more protection against Chinese economic retaliation. Additionally, the European Union has the benefit of being a relatively new actor, without much of the historic baggage of the United States, NATO, or indeed many EU member states with a colonial past. As Eve Fitriani found in a Carnegie Europe paper examining Indonesia’s views of the European Union, “Compared with other major powers, the EU is seen more positively in the eyes of Indonesians, who prefer the EU as an international partner over the United States, China, or Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage European partners to use regional deployments to directly challenge unlawful Chinese maritime claims.&lt;/strong&gt; The periodic naval deployments of several European countries over the last few years — including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy — sent an important message to the region about Europe’s stake in Indo-Pacific security, but the military value of such activities is limited. Given that their frequency is unlikely to change significantly, Washington should urge its European partners to define a clear operational purpose for such deployments. In addition to providing opportunities for ad hoc training and exercises, these deployments should be used to advance the larger effort to push back on excessive Chinese maritime claims and uphold international law. Specifically, in coordination with INDOPACOM, European navies could conduct transits of the Taiwan Strait — as the UK navy has done — or conduct freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea to contest specific Chinese maritime claims in the region. Simple “presence operations” are not enough: European navies should be prepared to directly challenge China’s unlawful claims, to reinforce the message that China’s actions are a global issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevate the U.S.-EU Security and Defense dialogue.&lt;/strong&gt; The establishment of the U.S.-EU Security and Defense dialogue was met with considerable opposition inside the U.S. government. The dialogue has now been formed and has proved useful; however, the engagement is conducted at the deputy assistant secretary level on both sides. Given the potential utility of EU naval missions, the importance of the European Union’s voice in upholding international agreements such as UNCLOS, the development of significant EU-funded security assistance programs, and growing EU investment in defense, the dialogue should be elevated to an assistant secretary level and should include an official on both sides responsible for Indo-Pacific security affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage the European Union to speak out more forcefully on Indo-Pacific issues.&lt;/strong&gt; Washington should encourage the European Union and European countries to speak out more forcefully when China violates international law and norms. For instance, China is routinely violating UNCLOS, to which European countries are signatories and can speak on with authority. The EU delegation to the Philippines in Manila put out a joint statement on UNCLOS and Chinese violations; this should be common practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage defense industrial cooperation between Europe and the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/strong&gt; There is growing defense industrial engagement between Europe and the Indo-Pacific. For instance, Poland has bought large quantities of Korean-made equipment, including tanks and artillery. Additionally, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan have joined together to produce a next-generation fighter jet under the GCAP program. This sort of collaboration may create stronger competitors to U.S. industry and at times further disrupt Europe’s already fragmented defense industrial base. Yet the United States should encourage these types of defense industrial engagements, which significantly strengthen ties and can help network U.S. allies and partners. They will increase industrial capacity globally and make Europe and Indo-Pacific partners feel more vested in the security situation in each other’s regions. For example, France’s extensive arms-sales relationship with India has helped strengthen ties between Paris and New Delhi. AUKUS has contributed to the United Kingdom’s Indo-Pacific tilt and provides perhaps the most prominent example of industrial cooperation between Europe and the Indo-Pacific. Additional partners, in Europe or the Indo-Pacific, should be brought in to collaborate on AUKUS Pillar Two as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote NATO standardization of armaments to boost capacity for partners.&lt;/strong&gt; European defense production is ramping up in response to Ukraine, and this capacity could help augment U.S. production in a conflict. For instance, Europe can boost U.S. defense industrial capacity particularly when it comes to munitions, such as 155-millimeter artillery, and more sophisticated precision-guided munitions, such as Storm Shadow. However, that requires the defense industry to ensure U.S. weapons platforms can use such munitions interchangeably. Thus, the United States should prioritize ensuring a higher level of NATO standardization of munitions, because it has direct implications for the United States if it wants to tap into European defense production. The United States should also seek to encourage broader standardization among its allies — both in Europe and Asia. Thus, NATO could seek to include the armaments directors of the IP4 countries in many of its discussions and meetings to ensure broader standardization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage Europe to become a security assistance provider to the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/strong&gt; EU assistance could be directed toward countries that complement U.S. engagement or have needs that go beyond what existing U.S. and other allied assistance can provide. Presently, European assistance efforts are limited by both decades of underinvestment in defense and the need to support Ukraine. Nevertheless, Europe may in the coming years increase its capacity to transfer weapons to Indo-Pacific partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, prior to the Ukraine war, the European Union created the European Peace Facility (EPF), a security assistance fund that can provide weapons to partners. The EPF is now being used largely to support Ukraine and has seen its budget dramatically increase to €17 billion ($18.5 billion) for use between 2021 and 2027. While Ukraine has been its overwhelming focus, the EPF was developed with the objective of aiding developing countries outside of Europe, much like the State or Defense Department’s security assistance fund. While the original budget for the fund is far less than U.S. security assistance programs, the fund’s budget before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was projected to be roughly €850 million ($1 billion) per year. The United States should engage with the European Union on this fund and encourage funding for the Indo-Pacific, and coordinate in identifying priority capabilities and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Europe is engaged in a significant force modernization, which may lead in the coming years to the retirement of systems excess to requirements. Much of these systems will likely head to Ukraine, but there may be opportunities in the maritime domain. Lastly, Europe may also have significant spare production capacity in the coming years. As it ramps up to support Ukraine and rebuild its stockpiles, it may have significant overcapacity in future years that could be used to support and build ties with certain Indo-Pacific partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s support for Russia in the invasion of Ukraine underscores the reality that security in the Indo-Pacific and in Europe are linked. U.S. alliances in Europe and the Indo-Pacific can therefore no longer be managed as separate entities, with contingency planning undertaken in isolation and without regard to trade-offs and the possible interplay of conflict across theaters. In the near term, U.S. policy should focus on ensuring that NATO and European allies can sustain deterrence in Europe with a reduced U.S. role. Europe’s role in Indo-Pacific security by necessity should therefore remain small and focused on discrete areas where concrete contributions are possible. Over the longer term, Washington should open a pathway for a European contribution to Indo-Pacific security.&lt;/p&gt;
