On April 1, 2014, the government of Japan introduced the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology (hereinafter referred to as the “Three Principles”) to replace the original Three Principles, allowing arms exports only when they contribute to the active promotion of peace and international cooperation, as well as Japan’s national security. The new principles included the Strategy on Defense Production and Technological Bases — which shifted away from the previous policy of maintaining all defense production and the technology base domestically to a policy of allowing some international joint development and joint production. The government has been working on defense equipment transfers under the new Three Principles ever since, but there has been only one transfer of a complete system: the sale of an air-defense radar system to the Philippines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this trend continues, Japan’s defense industrial base will continue to decline. How can Japan reverse this trend and increase exports of defense equipment? This paper explores possibilities for Japan by comparing the defense export systems of other countries, including the U.S. foreign military sales (FMS) program, and assesses whether Japan needs its own version of FMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-international-environment&quot;&gt;The International Environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Japan’s 2022 National Security Strategy highlights, the security environment around Japan is “as severe and complex as it has been since the end of World War II.” Some nations (such as China, North Korea, and Russia) are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;increasing their own national interests at the expense of others . . . , expanding their influence through both military and non-military means, attempting to unilaterally change the status quo, and accelerating actions to challenge the international order. Such moves have sharpened competition and confrontation among states in wide-ranging areas, including military, diplomatic, economic, and technological fields, and have shaken the foundation of the international order. As a result, the current international security environment has become complex and severe, one where inter-state relations and interests of each and every nation are intertwined with each other in a mosaic-like manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, there are worsening risks that these countries could impede free access to and utilization of the cyber, maritime, space, and electromagnetic domains. In the field of international trade, some nations are using economic tools — such as “restricting the exports of mineral resources, food, and industrial and medical supplies, as well as providing loans to other nations” that cannot sustain that level of debt — to influence and coerce other nations. As balances of power shift, there is a lack of strong leadership within the global governance structure to address these issues. The international community is therefore struggling to take on shared challenges such as climate change, arms control, disarmament, nonproliferation, terrorism, food and energy security, and preventing the spread of infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These dynamics are particularly prominent in the Indo-Pacific region. China has been expanding its military power, including nuclear capabilities, and has intensified its attempts to use force to unilaterally change the status quo in the East and South China Seas around Taiwan and the Senkaku Islands. It is also “strengthening its strategic ties with Russia and attempting to challenge the international order.” Meanwhile, Chinese development finance is taking advantage of countries’ reliance on China to exert economic pressure on them. These activities, which are worrying Japan and the international community, present “the greatest strategic challenge in ensuring the peace and security of Japan and the international community, as well as in strengthening the international order based on the rule of law.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s efforts to rapidly expand its nuclear and missile capabilities also pose a graver and more imminent threat to Japan’s national security than before. Meanwhile, Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has “shaken the very foundation of the international order.” Not only is Russian aggression the most significant and direct threat to security in Europe, it has also raised concerns in Japan about how Beijing’s ties with Russia could impact security in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to potential adversaries’ growing capabilities in new and traditional forms of warfare, the government of Japan has concluded it is necessary to fundamentally reinforce Japan’s defense capabilities to protect its citizens. Japan’s new National Defense Strategy, also released in December 2022, notes the importance of both integrating all forms of national power to reinforce Japan’s defense capabilities and enhancing deterrence by strengthening the U.S.-Japan alliance and other forms of security cooperation with like-minded countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japans-dwindling-defense-industrial-base&quot;&gt;Japan’s Dwindling Defense Industrial Base&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the decision to revise the Three Principles in 2014, only one transfer of a complete system has occurred since then, while the defense industrial base has shrunk as Japanese companies withdraw from the sector for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, even though the Three Principles allow defense equipment transfers in principle, the strict conditions in place effectively render exports the exception. Second, because most Japanese defense equipment is produced only for domestic procurement, it would be challenging to ensure they meet a purchasing country’s price, usage, and performance requirements. Third, the benefits of licensed production are no longer available: as defense systems have become more sophisticated and costly, international joint development and production have become the norm, and countries have become more reluctant to issue licenses for defense equipment containing sensitive technologies. In short, early licensed production of mature systems raised few technology-transfer problems, but newer, advanced defense systems naturally raise more releasability challenges. This has resulted in an increase in equipment imports from the United States through FMS, depriving domestic defense firms of opportunities to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If more domestic defense companies withdraw from the market, there is a risk of hindering the capabilities of the Japan Self-Defense Forces ( JSDF). Masashi Murano of the Hudson Institute has documented a case that captures the risk: In 2017, Japanese contractor Sumitomo Heavy Industries was able to quickly and affordably repair damage to the guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain. But if Japan’s defense industry shrinks further, this resilient logistics support capability will decline even in peacetime, slowing the operational tempo of both U.S. and Japanese forces — especially air defense, which requires faster turnaround times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this situation, Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Diet members introduced a proposal noting that since the defense industry is the foundation of Japan’s security, the government should assume the responsibility of sustaining and strengthening it — not just as part of industrial policy, but as a national security policy in and of itself. As it becomes more difficult to maintain a defense industrial base solely through domestic procurement, it is essential for Japan to find a way into overseas markets, both to make the industry more competitive and to boost national security. Furthermore, the overseas transfer of defense equipment — not only complete systems but also repair and maintenance of critical parts — would help promote defense cooperation with other countries in the Indo-Pacific, thereby securing the defense supply chains of partner countries and enhancing Japan’s strategic posture in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the LDP Diet members’ proposal, although the overseas transfer of defense equipment would require proactive efforts by the private sector, the government would have to guide these industry efforts. In deciding whether to allow defense equipment exports, Japanese defense agencies should not only factor in the price, usage, and performance of potential exports, but also the overall state of defense cooperation with the purchasing country. The government would also be responsible for offering training on and maintenance of the equipment, something private companies cannot handle alone, especially in developing countries that have local-content requirements. When bidding on international opportunities, competitors will likely be companies from other advanced countries, whose bids will reflect defense exports supported by national policy and public-private partnerships. As Japan is less experienced with defense equipment transfers, preparing competitive proposals will require Japan’s public and private sectors to build a new cooperative framework in which the government takes the lead in guiding collaboration with the private sector. The LDP Diet members put forth a Japanese version of FMS as one possible model for a “new system of public-private partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business community has voiced similar concerns. According to the Japan Business Federation’s proposal for a new National Security Strategy, Japanese defense-related companies should “implement domestic development with overseas transfers in mind and to build a system of public-private cooperation.” The government could support defense exports by providing capital investments to lower initial costs and usage fees, by expediting the transfer of information and equipment, and by providing operational support and training to recipient countries. To mitigate associated risks, the Japan Business Federation concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;t is necessary to consider the establishment of a system under which the Japanese government receives orders for defense equipment from foreign governments, Japanese defense-related companies deliver the equipment to the Japanese government, and the Japanese government transfers the equipment to foreign governments (a Japanese version of the FMS system).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;benefits-of-fms&quot;&gt;Benefits of FMS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FMS is a form of government-to-government (G2G) transaction in which (as the name implies) the government becomes a contracting party to the purchase and sale of equipment. This is especially prevalent in the international defense market, where — contrary to all the other sectors of the globalized economy — legitimate purchasers are exclusively states, most suppliers are authorized to sell by their respective governments, and the state often directly or indirectly controls the defense industrial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While government support for defense sales is not new, the past 20 years have witnessed a dramatic acceleration of government activities in this area. The globalization of defense markets, together with increased international competition and demand from outside Europe, has led traditional defense suppliers to use G2G agreements more frequently. G2G transactions feature several advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By strengthening their respective military capabilities, purchasing countries can deal more effectively with common threats. Russia and China similarly use sales of military equipment as part of “wider politico-military collaboration agreements.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Purchasing countries can implement a defense acquisition process faster through G2G transactions than through a commercial tender. Since the government is the contracting party, the approval of export licenses may be faster than for commercial contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;G2G transactions entail a public guarantee. Since the government is the contracting party, it facilitates the transfer of equipment. If there are problems with the equipment, the government — not just the supplier company — will be obligated to provide support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supplier companies can “set limits on the requests from purchasers to transfer technologies and know-how under the sales contract.” In fact, the U.S. FMS system restricts technology transfer as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;G2G transactions enable the transfer or sale of surplus equipment held by supplier country armed forces, shifting the costs of storing it to the purchasing country. This helps promote closer cooperation and integration between the countries’ militaries. A supplier country can also use free transfers to encourage the recipient to buy more advanced equipment in the future — as when Germany gave surplus Leopard tanks to other European countries, “paving the way for further acquisitions of later versions of the same tanks.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under G2G transactions, supplier companies also have an advantage during offset negotiations. The government of the supplier country can negotiate offsets on their behalf, and the scope of the offsets can more easily be broadened to include the entire domestic industry, thus reducing the burden on the supplier company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FMS operations in the United States further illustrate the benefits for both supplier and recipient countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For U.S. suppliers, participation in the FMS system reduces administrative burdens. Not only are export licenses incorporated in the FMS process — with the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) managing all required paperwork and permissions — companies can rest easy that all transactions are in accordance with U.S. law, and recipient countries are assured that the acquisition process will be subject to the U.S. Department of Defense’s (DOD) standards through every step of the process. This also dramatically reduces U.S. companies’ risks: because they sign contracts with the DOD, not with a foreign customer, they are guaranteed to get paid and do not have to worry about being sued by recipient countries. This makes it easier for small and medium-sized U.S. defense companies to participate in the FMS system. FMS also creates opportunities for private suppliers to build on U.S. government sales. Since the U.S. government is essentially procuring goods on behalf of a foreign government, the defense companies they are sourcing from may more readily sell these products under FMS, especially those already registered as standard military parts and catalogued with a National Stock Number (NSN). This helps supplier companies expand into international markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States as a whole, FMS strengthens relations with recipient countries by nurturing long-term military relationships, including through access to joint training and doctrine and increased opportunities for standardization with U.S. forces. The United States generally tends to prefer FMS transactions over general exports because the U.S. government has more control over them, which is required for defense exports of sensitive technologies. In practice, defense equipment exports to major countries are a mix of FMS and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the customer, FMS purchases of equipment tend to be cheaper because orders can consolidated and/ or sourced from older U.S. military inventories. (Conversely, this creates a disadvantage in that the product is not new and cannot be customized for the recipient country. This is an increasingly serious problem in cases where customers prefer that sellers build “exportability” into future defense system development.) In addition, the total package approach FMS uses means that the purchase of a major system includes training, spare parts, and other support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the U.S. government — unlike with G2G transactions in other countries — does not participate in offset negotiations, preferring a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy on negotiations between U.S. defense companies and recipient countries. This means that FMS recipient countries do not have to negotiate with the U.S. government, but nevertheless have access to sensitive equipment not available through DCS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FMS and G2G transactions are the same in that the government of the supplier country becomes a party to the contract. For convenience, this paper will refer to FMS as a system in which the government is more involved or acts as an intermediary — in effect becoming the customer for an industry supplier. This role applies not only to sales but also to the entire package, including technical support and services such as training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;feasibility-of-fms-in-japan&quot;&gt;Feasibility of FMS in Japan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can Japan adopt an FMS system that has these advantages for both the supplier and recipient countries?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government of Japan has facilitated some transfers of defense equipment as a form of security assistance to regional neighbors. However, with little experience in international defense operations or exports, it is not able to replicate the complex U.S. FMS process. Many organizations are involved in the U.S. FMS network; DSCA alone employs more than 1,000 people. In addition, the United States holds a dominant share of the international defense market, with approximately 189 nations and international organizations participating in FMS procurements. The United States maintains alliances with many countries with whom it can use FMS transfers to promote standardization — which further contributes to these relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the United States has a defense budget and armed forces much larger than those of Japan, as well as established export markets that support its defense industrial base. In comparison, Japan’s defense industry is not investing in large-scale manufacturing facilities. Even if such facilities were built, it is not clear whether their products would be marketable. Other countries might not be willing to purchase Japanese equipment, which (unlike U.S. equipment) has not been proven through operational experience. In addition, there are no “pure” defense companies in Japan. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) is the largest Japanese defense contractor, but defense comprised only 12 percent of its business in 2021. Defense is also (rightly) viewed as a low-margin business by companies operating in more profitable commercial sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, perhaps there is another equipment export system besides the U.S. FMS model that Japan can use as a reference. Similar G2G transaction processes adopted by other countries may offer useful examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;france&quot;&gt;France&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-status-of-defense-exports&quot;&gt;Current Status of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), in the 2017–2021 period, France’s global share of defense equipment export value was 11 percent, ranking it third in the world. This value grew by 59 percent compared to the previous five-year period (2011–16). Between 2001 and 2020, the total value of French defense exports to Europe declined, while those to all other regions grew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-of-defense-exports&quot;&gt;Background of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France has a higher degree of government involvement in defense equipment exports than other countries. The French state and the defense industry are also structurally interdependent. According to an International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) report, French defense manufacturers are “in the privileged position of facing little competition in producing major weapons systems and selling them to the government.” The Direction Générale de l’Armement (DGA) in the French Ministry of Defense plays a key role by purchasing weapons and controlling defense industrial policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FRANCE’S DEFENSE EXPORT PROMOTION AGENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important instrument for promoting arms exports is the Direction du Développement International (DI), a department within the DGA that is tasked with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;coordinating interministerial initiatives; maintaining contacts with foreign officials with a view to opening new markets to French defense manufacturers; supervising exports by state-owned companies; . . . organising arms fairs in France; coordinating financial assistance for the defense industry; participating in contract negotiations [G2G]; and also offering an after-sales service that includes technical assistance for arms purchasers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONSISTENT ARMS-EXPORT DOCTRINE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon returning to power in 1958, President Charles de Gaulle insisted that France “should be independent from the two superpowers dominating the Cold War.” This required “an autonomous capacity to build weapons systems for the needs of its armed forces.” “Arms sales sustained an independent defense industry, which in turn sustained the French independent posture.” Thus, “success in the arms trade became a symbol of France’s capacity to defend itself — or the business ‘model of our sovereignty.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctrine that arms sales are indispensable to French sovereignty persists: “Arms exports were also regarded as benefiting the French economy as a whole, not only through their direct contribution to the balance of payments and job creation but also through spillover effects for civilian industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The absence of political debate about the direction of France’s arms-export policy means that, to a large extent, the bureaucracy has been allowed to be the arbiter of export controls.” This has made it easier for the French government to address increased competition in the global arms market by simplifying the export-control system and streamlining the processes by which defense companies receive authorization to export. This trend has continued throughout the post–Cold War era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLEXIBLE DEFENSE EQUIPMENT EXPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IISS report notes that in addition to offering proven equipment, France sought to attract customers by “depicting itself as a country that did not attach political conditions to arms sales and would not cease deliveries if a customer’s political or military situation changed.” For example, France was “one of the main suppliers of arms to South Africa during the apartheid era.” In addition, “the lack of response from [Emmanuel] Macron’s government to mounting criticism over arms sales to countries involved in the war in Yemen – primarily Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – suggests that the French arms-export doctrine is being maintained by the current president.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PUBLIC INVESTMENT BANK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public investment bank Bpifrance provides state guarantees, insuring companies against the risk of non-payment. Through Bpifrance, “the state also secured credit provided by private banks to arms purchasers,” which “benefits the arms buyer by making it unnecessary for them to immediately pay the French manufacturer the full price of their acquisition – instead they can repay the bank in instalments.” Moreover, a defense manufacturer that wants to tailor a product to a particular foreign client can receive a government loan to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FRENCH VERSION OF FMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A separate IISS report describes Belgium’s 2019 purchase of 442 French Griffon and Jaguar armored vehicles as “France’s first attempt to sell equipment using its own version of the U.S. FMS system.” This program, in which France purchases vehicles on Belgium’s behalf along with purchases for the French army, not only takes some of the pressure off the Belgian defense ministry but also leverages the French military’s economies of scale to lower the cost for Belgian equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provisions for the Belgian program include close cooperation with France on education and training. However, unlike the U.S. FMS system, France makes no obligations or guarantees on behalf of Nexter, the French company producing these armored vehicles, regarding the price, time, and performance conditions set by the contract. Furthermore, “no liability of France is incurred in the event of termination of the agreement or of the supply protocol, or of the failure of one party, or the occurrence of an external event that permanently and irrevocably opposes the execution of the contract.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In France, in addition to the conventional G2G program centered on DI, there is a recent agreement with Belgium to export CaMo, a new generation truck-mounted artillery system. This has been called a French version of FMS because production for export is carried out in conjunction with production for the French army. However, this is not the same as the U.S. FMS system because of the lack of large government guarantees. France’s own version of FMS still benefits from the country’s flexible export policy, use of an investment bank for financing, and security environment that motivates other countries to purchase its equipment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;australia&quot;&gt;Australia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-status-of-defense-exports-1&quot;&gt;Current Status of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to SIPRI data, during the 2017–21 period, Australia’s global share of defense equipment export value was only 0.6 percent, ranking it sixteenth in the world. However, compared to the 2011–16 five-year period, this value rose 97 percent, the third largest increase in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-of-defense-exports-1&quot;&gt;Background of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEFENSE EXPORT STRATEGY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia has a Defense Export Strategy dedicated to the export of defense equipment, which is rare. The 2018 strategy “builds on the 2016 Defence Industry Policy Statement by setting out a comprehensive system to plan, guide, and measure defense export outcomes.” It has four parts: (1) crafting a strategic approach to defense exports; (2) understanding the global defense market; (3) establishing the new defense export system; and (4) implementing defense export success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy notes that exports will boost future investment in Australia’s defense industry and create high-end manufacturing jobs. As it strives to make this industry stronger, more sustainable, and more globallycompetitive, the government has set five goals to reach by 2028:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“strengthen the partnership between the Australian Government and industry to pursue defence export opportunities;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;sustain Australia’s defence industrial capabilities across peaks and troughs in domestic demand;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;enable greater innovation and productivity in Australia’s defence industry to deliver world-leading Defence capabilities;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;maintain the capability edge of the Australian Defence Force and leverage Defence capability development for export opportunities; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;grow Australia’s defence industry to become a top ten global defence exporter.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy shows the government’s commitment to working with Australian companies to expand export opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUSTRALIA’S DEFENSE EXPORT PROMOTION AGENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian Defense Export Office (ADEO), established in April 2018 as part of the Defense Export Strategy, is the focal point for coordinating whole-of-government support for the Australian defense exports. ADEO is responsible for delivering the initiatives outlined in the Defense Export Strategy; working closely with an international network of defense attachés and business development managers in key markets; and engaging in G2G transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUSTRALIAN MILITARY SALES (AMS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the ADEO, the AMS office plans and executes G2G sales of matériel, sensitive technology, and services of the Australian defense industry. Its role is in “support[ing] Australian sovereign capability and military sales programs as well as promoting the Australian defence industry through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;International Government-to-Government sale, gifting or other transfer of surplus Australian Defence Force (ADF) articles&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;International Government-to-Government purchase of Australian origin, sensitive technology, and ADF articles&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supporting Australian defence industry to export to foreign government customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AMS office also publishes the Australian Defense Sales Catalogue, which provides information on ADF equipment and defense industry products and services sold to foreign governments. As part of these G2G transactions, surplus equipment is offered on an “as is, where is” basis, but new equipment can also be purchased. Prices may be specifically quoted or left to the market to decide, and payment is generally made in advance, but with flexibility in terms of delivery schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;comment-1&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Australia has prepared a strategy document specifically for defense equipment exports; based on this, Australia is using AMS, a type of standardized G2G transactions, to expand defense equipment exports. This AMS is similar to the U.S. FMS model and would be very helpful for Japan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;israel&quot;&gt;Israel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-status-of-defense-exports-2&quot;&gt;Current Status of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to SIPRI data, during the 2017–21 period, Israel’s global share of defense equipment export value was 2.4 percent, ranking it 10th in the world. However, this value decreased by 5.6 percent compared to the 2011–16 period. Nonetheless, Israel remains a major arms exporter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s economy depends heavily on defense-related exports. It has “extensive military relations with 130 countries that have been investing in Israel for decades through imports, exports, training and other security and military cooperation.” Increasingly, exports are going to Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific, areas of rapid military modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-of-defense-exports-2&quot;&gt;Background of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISRAEL’S DEFENSE EXPORT PROMOTION AGENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIBAT, the International Defense Cooperation directorate within Israel’s Ministry of Defense, maintains close ties with local defense companies, interfacing between industry and the defense establishment and staying on top of both technological developments and the operational needs of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF).

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Producing conferences; showcasing Israel’s technologies and capabilities under one roof at the Israel National Pavilion; attending global fairs &amp;amp; exhibitions and facilitating contact with participating industries”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROACTIVE UTILIZATION OF G2G TRANSACTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its limited resources compared to the United States, Israel excels at promoting G2G transactions that support exports by its small and medium-sized defense companies. The Israeli government recognizes that it cannot sustain its defense industry solely through domestic orders. As such, it has turned to G2G transactions to support its defense industrial base while still “preserving strategic autonomy and innovation potential.” By 2021, the value of G2G defense exports reached $3.365 billion, compared to $911 million in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel can export defense equipment through DCS under a government export license, but any exports that contain sensitive technology or are driven by national interests require the government to enter into a G2G arrangement with the purchasing country. For these large G2G deals, “the terms negotiated at a ministerial level enable both sides to reach agreements faster and at lower costs than commercial tender processes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The involvement of the Israeli government in arms sales benefits Israeli defense companies by allowing them to rely on the government in the event of trouble and benefits the purchasing country, which receives not only the equipment, but also education, training, and long-term maintenance by the IDF. Israeli G2G transactions differ from the U.S. FMS system in that the Israeli Ministry of Defense does not directly buy weapons from Israeli defense companies (such as Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Elbit Systems) and export them to purchasing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLEXIBLE DEFENSE EQUIPMENT EXPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel has adopted a flexible approach to arms exports and military assistance programs, using them to advance the country’s broader foreign policy objectives. It has supplied defense systems even to countries with human rights concerns, such as the Philippines under President Rodrigo Duterte and Myanmar, and to countries experiencing conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;comment-2&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Israel is promoting government-led equipment exports by making full use of G2G transactions, although not to the same extent as the U.S. FMS system. In addition, Israel’s experience in actual warfare and its flexible equipment exports are also contributing to the growth of its defense exports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;south-korea&quot;&gt;South Korea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-status-of-defense-exports-3&quot;&gt;Current Status of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to SIPRI data, during the 2017–2021 period, South Korea’s global share of defense equipment export value was 2.7 percent, ranking it eighth in the world. However, compared to the 2011–16 period, this value rose by 177 percent, the biggest increase of any country. South Korea’s arms exports have multiplied more than sixfold since 2005; in 2021 they exceeded imports for the first time. Beyond North America, regions targeted for exports now include Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-of-defense-exports-3&quot;&gt;Background of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOUTH KOREA’S DEFENSE EXPORT PROMOTION AGENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, a lack of transparency, dispersed organizational management, and insufficient management of financial resources in the existing acquisition system had led to inefficiency and weakened the competitiveness of the defense industry. As a result, as of January 1, 2006, the defense acquisition structures of eight different defense institutions — including the Ministry of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, each military branch and the Defense Procurement Agency — shut down, and these functions were brought under the new Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), an administrative center with the role of “improvement of defense capabilities, promotion of the defense industry, [and] procurement of munitions.” To make Korean defense exports more competitive, DAPA is also “designing regional strategies for strengthening export competitiveness and actively carrying out international cooperation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STRONG LEADERSHIP, UTILIZATION OF TOP SALESPEOPLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, the success or failure of policies to promote the domestic defense industry and proactively export equipment overseas have largely depended on the leadership of President Moon Jae-in, who served from 2017 to 22. The strength of South Korea’s equipment export project stems from the fact that under President Moon’s leadership, political leaders, the government, industry, and the military have come together under a unified structure. “Top sales,” in which the president directly pitches to other heads of state, are now commonplace, and defense industrial cooperation is often an important issue on the agenda during diplomacy with partner countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UTILIZATION OF NATIONAL DEFENSE DIPLOMACY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea has long used “defense diplomacy,” both passive forms such as military exchanges and cooperation and “active military diplomacy, such as political ties with allied countries or the deployment of military forces abroad at the request of allied nations or international organizations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea is using this defense diplomacy to sell equipment. For example, it deployed troops to Iraq from 2003 to 2008 and in December 2013 concluded a sales contract with Iraq for T-50 training aircraft, following the improvement of bilateral ties based on the reputation of the South Korean military there. In 2013, South Korea participated in typhoon relief efforts in the Philippines and held an event commemorating its participation in the Korean War, thereby establishing friendly relations and paving the way for a March 2014 contract to sell the Philippines FA-50 light attack aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CUSTOMIZED EXPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea is seizing commercial opportunities through “customized” exports based on meticulous market research. This sales approach “thoroughly examines the security environment, financial situation, and industrial structure of the customer and flexibly considers sales methods.” Sometimes, this results in “joint production with local companies, second-hand sales, and financial support,” tying negotiations to government economic assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UTILIZATION OF DCS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea does not use G2G transactions for defense sales. Given the country’s history of military coups, this is to avoid a public backlash against direct military involvement. The South Korean government has been limited to providing follow-up services such as training and maintenance after equipment sales, as it has done in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is expected that G2G transactions will be adopted in the future. That is why it is difficult for one company alone to promote exports, as defense trades are generally based on mutual trust between the governments involved. Since its establishment in 2006, DAPA has taken the role of directly selling defense articles as requested by a purchasing government. These kind of G2G transactions enable follow-on logistics support for an exported weapon system and serve as a starting point for secondary exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADVANTAGES FOR PURCHASING COUNTRIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s $15 billion defense acquisition framework agreement with Poland “could become Seoul’s most lucrative defense export package to date.” According to the Polish minister of national defense, the contract was concluded because of the excellent level of quality, speed of shipment, and of involvement of Polish industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, South Korea has supported defense exports with license production and technology transfer arrangements, including in Indonesia (amphibious vessels and submarines), Egypt, and India (K9 self-propelled howitzer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIGH DEFENSE R&amp;amp;D EXPENDITURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2022 fiscal year, South Korea had a high research and development (R&amp;amp;D) expenditure of approximately 400 billion yen ($3 billion), or 100 billion yen ($0.75 billion) more than Japan did. This high R&amp;amp;D investment is likely the reason behind the development of numerous competitive products such as the K9 artillery system and the FA-50 and T-50 aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;comment-3&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;South Korea has not yet introduced G2G transactions. However, under strong presidential leadership, DAPA has taken the lead in a whole-of-government approach to defense exports, which have been increasing at a breakneck pace as a result. This trend is due not only to the cost performance of the equipment, but also to the other promotions included in the sales package. The introduction of G2G transactions will make it easier for South Korean companies to participate in equipment exports, as they will be guaranteed by the government.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;germany&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-status-of-defense-exports-4&quot;&gt;Current Status of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to SIPRI data, in the 2017–2021 period, Germany’s global share of defense-equipment export value was 4.5 percent, ranking it fifth in the world. However, compared to the 2011–16 period, this value fell by 19 percent. Nonetheless, German arms exports hit a new record in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-of-defense-exports-4&quot;&gt;Background of Defense Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UTILIZATION OF DCS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany also does not use G2G transactions for defense sales, given the nation’s history during World War II and public concerns over the direct involvement of the military. However, the German government certainly provides support for such exports. For example, it backs sales of German submarines and tanks with training by the German armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STRONG DEFENSE INDUSTRY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany has traditionally been a manufacturing powerhouse, with its products known for their high quality and reliability. This is also true for defense systems: the Leopard 2 tank is highly valued by various countries, and conventional submarines of German design are in service throughout the world. The efficiency and competitiveness of its defense industry places Germany in a very favorable position in the international market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPORT POLICY BECOMING MORE FLEXIBLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German arms-export policy is governed by EU law (such as Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP of December 8, 2008, which sets criteria for member states to use in issuing export licenses), the German Constitution (in particular, Article 26 (2) of the Basic Law, which requires licenses for all manufacture, transportation, and distribution of weapons), other national laws (including the War Weapons Control Act, the Foreign Trade and Payments Act, the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance), and the Political Principles of the Federal Government for the Export of War Weapons and Other Military Equipment. Exports are strictly controlled by export licenses issued in accordance with these regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany’s legal framework has made it difficult to directly export defense equipment to countries with human rights violations. However, according to the Bonn International Center for Conversion (BICC), “in 2019, Germany approved arms exports to 55 states whose human rights situation were classified as ‘very poor.’” Germany’s Enable &amp;amp; Enhance Initiative allows for the export of dual-use technologies to support crisis management and post-conflict and peace-building operations, generally destined for countries considered unstable. In addition, German companies are increasingly relocating production of defense equipment abroad and then exporting to third countries via subsidiaries to circumvent arms-export regulations. Further, German companies also are allowed to support the development of defense industrial capacity abroad in less sensitive defense fields, which also facilitates the international production of defense equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to complying with the letter of EU and other international agreements, Germany has generally avoided exporting arms to parties to a conflict. However, Germany recently reversed this long-standing policy to provide Ukraine with defensive weapons. This may set a precedent for future defense exports to warring countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;comment-4&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Germany has not adopted formal G2G transactions for defense exports. In part due to negative popular views on the arms trade, Germany has generally followed strict arms-export rules. However, even with these strict restrictions, “loophole-like practices” have been expanding under the guise of contributing to international peace. Germany is also expanding its arms exports due to the capabilities of its outstanding defense industry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Practices of a country may overlap in more than one category. The categories listed reflect increasing levels of government involvement and guarantees; they may overlap on detailed points but reflect an evolution in favor of government involvement in defense equipment exports. The degree of government involvement does not depend on G2G contracts (for example, South Korea has become a heavy promoter of defense exports even though it exclusively uses DCS).

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-for-japan&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations for Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the export-promotion strategies of these major exporters of defense equipment, this paper presents eight recommendations — listed in order of priority — for expanding Japan’s own such exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-utilize-g2g-transactions-make-the-japanese-government-a-contracting-party&quot;&gt;1. Utilize G2G Transactions (Make the Japanese Government a Contracting Party)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy of promoting overseas exports of defense equipment under national leadership is clearly stated in the new Defense Buildup Plan, to which the government should make a firm commitment. Even if Japan does not introduce an FMS system like that of the United States (or France), where the government is more involved, it should utilize G2G transactions and become a contracting party negotiating directly with the government of the purchasing country. (The 2020 transfer of air surveillance radar systems to the Philippines was not a G2G transaction as defined in this report because the contract itself was between Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and the Philippine Air Force.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the defense industry, both supplier and purchasing governments are involved to varying degrees. In such a unique market, it would be unreasonable for Japanese defense companies to negotiate with the government of the purchasing country. Negotiations under G2G transactions would reduce this burden for Japanese defense companies and allow them to concentrate on improving their performance, such as by engaging with companies in the purchasing country — as neither government nor industry talks will work without the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, it is common in the defense market for the purchasing country to insist on offset conditions. Since negotiations on these may extend beyond the defense industry, government involvement would benefit both suppliers and purchasers. It would also facilitate sales because the government will be providing a sense of security by endorsing the defense equipment being exported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G2G transactions also make it relatively easy to sell associated services. In the case of the F-35, for example, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries hosts the maintenance, repair, overhaul, and upgrade depot for the Indo-Pacific region. Similarly, Japan should do the maintenance of F-15s, U.S. fighter jets deployed by other Asian countries. It is difficult to transport the engines to the United States every time to conduct maintenance. The only Asian countries that can service the engines of fighter jets are Japan, South Korea, and Australia, so selling this service would be profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-establish-a-new-equipment-export-promotion-agency&quot;&gt;2. Establish a New Equipment Export Promotion Agency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new specialized agency in charge of G2G transactions for defense equipment exports should be established within the Japanese government akin to South Korea’s DAPA, France’s DI, or Israel’s SIBAT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the export of defense equipment involves various government bodies such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA); Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI); MOD; the Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Agency (ATLA); and the National Security Secretariat (NSS) in the prime minister’s office, it would be most effective to place export authority under an interagency organization such as NSS. This would help overcome stovepiping and bureaucratic rivalries among government agencies. Housing such an agency under the NSS would also give the public the impression of a whole-of-government approach like South Korea’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new export promotion agency should create a Japanese Defense Export Strategy like Australia’s. This would help explain the strategy to the Japanese public, which is still resistant to exporting defense equipment, and gain support from the defense industry and other government sectors. The new agency should also draw on private sector businesses experienced in defense transactions, such as trading companies. As evidenced by the failure of Japan’s attempt to export Soryu submarines to Australia in 2016, close coordination with the defense industry is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-strengthen-rd-related-to-security&quot;&gt;3. Strengthen R&amp;amp;D Related to Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, defense R&amp;amp;D expenditures in Japan were limited. However, in the proposed 2023 budget, defense R&amp;amp;D expenditures rose significantly to 896.8 billion yen, a threefold increase from the previous fiscal year. While this is commendable, the government should further strengthen support for technology research. This could include establishing a defense-focused think tank that can ask industry to carry out technological research based on a clear definition of requirements and attendant capabilities for defense operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also essential to have an R&amp;amp;D hub inside the government. For example, MOD, METI, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) are working to create a joint research institute to develop quantum and cyber-related technologies with national security applications. Since MOD lacks enough personnel with the expertise to identify important civilian technologies, it benefits from coordinating with METI and MIC, which are more familiar with these technologies and their potential military applications. One engineer from the private sector called for the government to inject 1 trillion yen in funds every year for research that these officials can conduct at their own discretion, noting that, “If the government takes the initiative with a budget, we [engineers] would do anything.” Japan is generally praised for engineering capacity that generates advanced capacities, but it lacks a mechanism for applying such ingenuity to the realm of security. In contrast to industrial policy, where fear of failure often leads to risk aversion, it will be important to encourage taking risks in defense technology research and accept failure even when large amounts of money are allocated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a country with no recent combat experience, the development of defense equipment using cutting-edge technology will help Japanese industry become more internationally competitive. Japan’s new National Defense Strategy states that “Japan will establish a new research institution in MOD to find multi-use cutting-edge technologies that contribute to defense equipment development, and to produce equipment that leads to defense innovation.” This should be an urgent priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-promote-deregulation&quot;&gt;4. Promote Deregulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since export criteria should be transparent and supportive of Japanese industry, the Three Principles for arms exports should be further revised to clarify the government’s strategy and criteria for defense equipment exports. Currently, the government can make exceptions on a case-by-case basis, but the principles do not include a transparent process for Japanese defense companies to follow. For example, current rules state that fighter aircraft cannot be exported to countries not involved in their joint development, but this should be made possible to support the defense industrial base. Not counting international joint development and production, equipment considered for transfers is essentially limited to five categories of use (rescue, transportation, warning, surveillance, and minesweeping).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, under the current policy, defense equipment cannot be transferred to a country engaged in conflict, but countries responding to aggression — such as Ukraine — should be able to receive support from Japan. As mentioned above, Germany, France, Israel, and other countries have increased their sales partly by exporting defense equipment to parties involved in conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Three Principles note that “prior to overseas transfer of defense equipment and technology, the Government will in principle oblige the Government of the recipient country to gain its prior consent regarding extra-purpose use and transfer to third parties in order to ensure appropriate control of the defense equipment and technology after the overseas transfer.” Japan should make this policy more flexible by giving purchasing countries the responsibility for overseeing their use for other purposes. As mentioned above, South Korea allows purchasing countries to resell equipment to other buyers without approval, an approach that has increased sales. Japan should establish an efficient process for reviewing transfer requests and relax requirements for end users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s new National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy state that the Three Principles, their implementation guidelines, and other procedures should be revised to promote the smooth transfer of defense equipment and technology and international joint development in a broad array of fields. Deregulation and flexibility will prove critical in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-encourage-low-interest-government-loans&quot;&gt;5. Encourage Low-Interest Government Loans&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the international defense market, it is common for developing countries to request low-interest loans as a condition of purchase. However, since private financial institutions are often unable to agree on interest rates and other terms, these purchases are sometimes abandoned. The Japanese government should provide low-interest loans to developing countries — perhaps modeled on those of Bpifrance — to increase defense equipment exports. Japan could encourage its defense companies to use the government-funded Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) system, which provides insurance for high-risk overseas transactions that are not covered by private insurance companies, to support financing for defense equipment exports to developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s new National Defense Strategy states that “Japan will carry forward with the transfer of defense equipment and technology in the joint public and private efforts by establishing a fund, and implementing measures including providing corporate assistance as necessary to smoothly promote such transfers.” Such efforts should also prioritize supporting developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-utilize-high-level-government-representation&quot;&gt;6. Utilize High-Level Government Representation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan should consider adopting the “top sales” model used by South Korea and various European countries. Staff from the proposed defense equipment export agency could accompany the prime minister on overseas trips to actively promote defense products. The ministers of foreign affairs; defense; and economy, trade, and industry should do the same when they travel abroad, as should officials from other relevant agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan should also exercise defense diplomacy. This does not mean that Japan should actively participate in conflicts (which is constitutionally prohibited) but that it could take advantage of its involvement in UN-led and other multinational peacekeeping operations to promote its defense equipment. For example, outdoor bathing systems, water supply vehicles, and water purification vehicles used for disaster relief could prove attractive, as could Japan’s expertise in de-mining using its Type 92 Mine Rollers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export promotion should also be assigned to Japanese defense attachés and other embassy staff (e.g., defense teams) stationed overseas. (These same offices will also need to be strengthened to enable more effective management of Japanese defense procurement.) It will be important to designate a point of contact in charge of defense exports within Japanese embassies or other government institutions, as Japanese defense companies sometimes do not know with whom to talk about defense equipment exports. These officials should also be tasked with gathering information on host-nation defense requirements that would be suitable for Japanese exports. Efforts should initially focus on researching the demand for Japanese equipment in Southeast Asian countries, which is important for countering China in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;7-encourage-corporate-restructuring&quot;&gt;7. Encourage Corporate Restructuring&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the end of the Cold War, many Western countries reduced their defense budgets, leading to widespread consolidation and restructuring of related industries. However, in Japan, there has been no integration and restructuring among defense contractors. Consolidating and integrating major firms like MHI and Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) would be difficult, but this approach could prove successful for smaller companies. In the future, Japan should seek to consolidate major defense contractors into companies that are not just departments within large corporations. In other words, Japan should create companies more like Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, Diehl Defence, and Saab AB — whose work is primarily focused on defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production of ammunition provides a good example of Japan’s dilemma: “A rifle cartridge consists of a bullet, a shell casing, an ammunition belt, and a primer. Each of these is manufactured by a different company. Of course, the gunpowder is [manufactured by] another company.” If any one company in this inefficient supply chain fails, the manufacture of ammunition is delayed. It seems possible to integrate and reorganize these companies or have them be incorporated into major firms such as MHI and KHI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;8-champion-two-way-flows-of-investment&quot;&gt;8. Champion Two-Way Flows of Investment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help the Japanese defense industry, the government should promote collaboration with foreign companies that have international expertise, starting with small components and then gradually transitioning to larger systems. In this context, it is important that there be two-way flows of investment with foreign partners in the defense industry. For example, foreign defense manufacturers should be allowed to invest in Japanese defense companies — which, in turn, should be able to work with international partners on projects beyond those commissioned by the JSDF. Realizing this objective will require a marketing license process, which would enable Japan’s defense industry to engage potential international partners beyond the country’s existing joint defense programs. The Japanese government should learn from the U.S. Department of State’s efforts to support the activities of defense companies by clarifying the DSP-5 marketing license process. Without such measures, Japan’s defense industry will never be competitive and defense exports will remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A whole-of-government strategy is needed in order for Japan to better promote defense equipment exports. This export strategy should include measures to manage export controls and information security; create an export-promotion agency; strengthen government expertise and representation overseas; and promote not only exports but also support services. In addition, Japan’s defense industry cannot remain passive and should engage with the international community through marketing, joint R&amp;amp;D, and overseas investment activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measures should be modest at first, focusing on a realistic level of support for defense equipment export activities before expanding as the capabilities and experience of the Japanese government and defense industry develop. At some point, the government will also have to consider introducing a Japanese version of FMS and restructuring the defense industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, CSIS convened a track 1.5 dialogue of Australian, Indian, and U.S. experts to examine emerging threats and strategic stability in the Indian Ocean region. The discussion included analysts and former practitioners as well as several serving government officials from participating countries. The first session in June convened virtually. The second engagement convened in person in October. The engagements were held under the Chatham House Rule. Discussions revealed several specific areas of concern. Many but not all concerns focused on China. They included the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s conventional military modernization&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s non-transparent conventional and nuclear force changes&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s demonstrated willingness to use force — such as at India’s border with China — to assert its claims&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report summarizes key discussions, findings, and recommendations stemming from the dialogues. Unless otherwise identified, all quotations used in this document were from dialogue participants. They are uncredited here to respect the dialogue ground rule for non-attribution under the Chatham House Rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary-of-findings&quot;&gt;Summary of Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regional security dynamics are changing quickly.&lt;/em&gt; The most important observation from the discussion is that security dynamics in the Indo-Pacific (both the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean region) are changing quickly. The changes are in large part driven by China’s long-term investments in a more capable military, assertive diplomacy, and interdependent trade relationships. China’s unwillingness to participate in existing mechanisms to reduce risk of nuclear conflict or exchange, as well as its lack of interest in engaging in bilateral discussions on arms control, leave few meaningful opportunities for dialogue on conflict risk or conflict avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Close alignment of leaders.&lt;/em&gt; Growing concern about deteriorating regional stability and China’s role are driving close alignment among many regional leaders. Few have a closer alignment than the United States, Australia, India, and Japan. The four countries, collectively referred to as “the Quad,” have convened several times at the president and prime minister level over the past three years to build a positive agenda for peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region. Three Quad countries were represented in this dialogue. Aligned views among the leaders include concerns about China’s activities and approach, the international order, and China’s use of economic, diplomatic, or military power to force changes in the global system. However, close alignment is not driving sufficient bureaucratic change in the three countries. Achieving shared regional stability goals for the United States, Australia, and India will require carefully managing relationships among them, particularly given the differences between India’s approach to Russia compared with that of the United States and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Importance of industrial capacity.&lt;/em&gt; The fighting in Ukraine demonstrates the importance of industrial capacity to produce both “smart” and “dumb” weapons in great quantities to sustain a conflict between large militaries. This point is key for logistics and resupply efforts given the vast distances in the Indo-Pacific. Ukraine’s effective response to Russia’s invasion in early 2022, in contrast to its performance in the 2014 conflict, underscores the strategic importance of being prepared before a conflict begins, rather than waiting for the start of a conflict to initiate preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need for greater cooperation on technological development.&lt;/strong&gt; Technology will be a necessary, but not a deciding, factor in future military confrontations. “No one technology, on its own, is likely to be a game changer.” Instead, technologies would be most impactful “in novel combination, or with novel concepts of operation.” Developing new technologies and quickly converting them to capabilities with partners will be an important determinant of future success. Relatedly, institutional capacity to be a “fast follower” will be a necessary competency, as no country will dominate the overall sphere of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concerns about nuclear weapons and deterrence.&lt;/strong&gt; Russia threatened to use nuclear weapons, including battlefield nuclear weapons, in Ukraine. Russia’s threats were met with mixed response from the United States and France. The U.S. response, a clear articulation that nuclear weapons employment is unacceptable, contrasts with the statement by French president Macron, that France would not employ nuclear weapons in response to a nuclear attack against a non-ally. Discussion highlighted that, rather than reassuring a nuclear weapon state that it is not under nuclear threat, narrow responses like France’s may embolden leaders creating an opening where they judge nuclear employment to be worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, participants noted that China’s growing nuclear arsenal may cause it to reevaluate its current “no first use” nuclear policy. Changes to China’s nuclear doctrine could precipitate numerous defense decisions throughout the region regarding forces, posture, and investments driving toward a potential escalation spiral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analysis&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the two dialogue sessions in June (virtually) and October (in person), participants covered critical areas on a range of topics. This section attempts to summarize those rich discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alignment-between-leaders&quot;&gt;Alignment between Leaders&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Alignment between the leaders is closer than it has ever been.” Participants noted the importance of this alignment in pushing forward on key initiatives bilaterally, trilaterally, and within the Quad. The closeness of views has permeated several layers into government leaders, including ministers and their deputies. However, it has not reached the necessary “14 layers down” into the bureaucracies to convert high-level alignment to rapid execution of new initiatives. The quote describes the challenges that policymakers can face where shifts in policy — especially those that require changes in process or regulations — can sometimes be slow to occur. The result is that progress is slower than the expansive visions leaders have committed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;areas-of-agreement&quot;&gt;Areas of Agreement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leaders are aligned on the type of threat China poses: that it seeks to “become a regional, if not a global, hegemon” in ways that undermine the interests of the United States, Australia, and India.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All three participating countries view with concern China’s expansion and modernization of its conventional and nuclear forces. China’s willingness to use its forces to coerce or confront its neighbors heightens these worries. Though not unanimous, concerns were high regarding the risk of Chinese military activity to coerce Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior leader alignment on the threat China poses has yet to galvanize action across the three countries’ governments. One participant put it succinctly, “Security is bringing us together, the hard edge of security. We need to couple that with cooperation on critical technology and the need to compete.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;India is taking a different diplomatic and strategic approach to Russia than the United States and Australia. India’s continued engagement with Russia for energy, in particular, remains a complicating factor in the relationship among the three countries. Dialogue highlighted that, so far, all three countries have successfully worked through differing approaches to the ongoing war in Ukraine, but noted that without careful management and consideration from all sides, this issue creates a risk of impeding ongoing cooperation among them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concerns-about-china&quot;&gt;Concerns about China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants began the discussion noting the degree to which their respective countries are concerned about China’s conventional military modernization, the modernization and expansion of China’s nuclear forces, and the lack of transparency surrounding them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;areas-of-agreement-1&quot;&gt;Areas of Agreement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s policies and actions — both civilian and military — are reshaping the security environment in the Indo-Pacific region. China is seen as pursuing disruptive efforts including its military modernization and employment; its aim to dominate all aspects of critical technologies; its nuclear modernization and expansion; and its willingness to use force to coerce neighbors on border issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Individually, these changes could be seen as typical pursuits for a rising power. However, the compounding effect of China seeking all simultaneously was seen by participants as ominous for regional security. One participant observed, “China’s effort can only be assumed to be regional, if not global, hegemony.” Participants agreed that their countries would view such an outcome as counter to their interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants viewed China’s nuclear force expansion and modernization as detrimental to regional stability. “The absence of meaningful explanation or dialogue” about China’s expansion and modernization of its conventional and nuclear forces is worrisome and further detracts from stability in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants noted the importance of preparing to deter — or succeed in — a conflict should China initiate one. This included developing adequate land, sea, and air forces; effective capabilities in space, cyber, and other emerging domains; and the necessary cooperative agreements and arrangements among the three countries and other like-minded states to achieve desired effects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;areas-of-difference&quot;&gt;Areas of Difference&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China poses a threat to current regional stability. However, the three countries do not always classify this threat the same — as one Indian participant noted, “The United States and Australia are focused on Taiwan, not watching closely India’s main concern: its northern border. The countries have different priorities.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Indian participants noted the dual nature of needing to defend its northern border and advance maritime capability to create sufficient defensive capability in the Indian Ocean, which is “India’s only maritime boundary.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Australian participants’ greatest concerns focused on China’s economic and political coercion and interference within Australia. They expressed confidence that China’s coercive efforts against Australia have been successfully rebuffed and can serve as a model for other countries that might find themselves on the receiving end of a PRC coercion campaign. A secondary concern for Australian participants — though related to the primary defense concern — was a scenario where China used force against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, Australian participants highlighted a long-standing debate about Australia’s defense capability: whether it should be used solely to defend Australia’s borders or to protect its interests beyond Australia’s borders. The latter case creates a greater priority for long-range strike capability. In all cases, Australian participants noted that Australia would uphold its alliance commitment to the United States, but that the specifics of that support could range from access to bases in Australia for operations up to combined military operations in the Western Pacific or Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. participants were most concerned with a potential PRC action against Taiwan, primarily invasion, secondarily blockade, and thirdly the potential for a more forceful gray zone campaign to destabilize Taiwan. In each of those cases, U.S. participants noted the challenges the United States would face in making a prompt political decision, then converting that decision into appropriate diplomatic, economic, and military responses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants engaged in an exchange about the implications of the China-India border standoffs. One U.S. participant said that Washington sees “China’s border clashes as a strategic success because it reoriented India away from its pursuit of becoming a regional maritime power.” This assessment seemed to surprise — and run counter to — Australian perceptions of the standoff as a defeat for China as it showed itself as an aggressor to the region. Indian participants added that Prime Minister Modi indicated the Indian Navy will have the resources it needs for modernization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Other Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The three countries — and other like-minded countries such as Japan — can engage in different responses that meet national objectives while contributing to collective security. Potential examples of such activities include closer collaboration on military cooperation, exercises, logistics, and access; closer efforts on priority areas for research and development, and production; and identifying ways to adapt bureaucratic processes in ways that recognize that time is no longer an abundant resource.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;India faces a combined maritime and land border challenge; Australia a political, economic, and distant security challenge; and the United States an economic competitor with a high likelihood of attempting to change the regional status quo and undermine fundamental U.S. interests using force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One participant assessed that “China is in turmoil. Its economy and supply chains are under stress. Its employment system is not working. Its financial and construction sectors appear to be fragile, and people’s savings are at risk if the previous elements continue to show cracks.” If this assessment is correct, and to the extent China’s current fragility continues or grows, it could raise an opportunity for like-minded countries to allow China’s own political decisions to impede its further growth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technology-is-necessary-but-is-not-a-solution-by-itself&quot;&gt;Technology Is Necessary but Is Not a Solution by Itself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;areas-of-agreement-2&quot;&gt;Areas of Agreement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discussions touched several times on the importance of developing and utilizing technology effectively. This included, primarily, technology’s importance in economic competitiveness, and secondarily its importance for military purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants described several overall trends in technology that impact almost every country (not just those in the dialogue):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The pace of technology development and innovation is outstripping governments’ ability to either understand or regulate technology.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Technology development is, in nearly all fields, led by the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Governments and militaries are inept at identifying private sector technology and incorporating it into their systems.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Governments’ inability to understand or anticipate technology also limits their capacity to develop international normative regimes that meaningfully impact the trajectory of technology development.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;China may be an exception to these observations as its pursuit of civil-military fusion deliberately blurs the lines between private sector and military and may allow it to both pursue militarily relevant technology and incorporate it more quickly — though the last point is acknowledged as speculative.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each country in the dialogue maintains its own roster of priority technology areas. Those lists overlap in several major areas: underwater technology, both crewed and uncrewed; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance technology; artificial intelligence; hypersonic weapons and hypersonic weapon defense; space, including defense of and reconstitution; and, over the longer term, directed energy and a range of quantum technologies. Many of these technological areas are militarily or commercially sensitive, making cooperation more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants seemed to agree that technology would be a necessary, but not determining, factor in future military confrontations. One participant noted, “No one technology, on its own, is likely to be a game changer.” Instead, technologies would be most impactful “in novel combination, or with novel concepts of operation.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with expressed doubt about the limitation of specific technologies on the future of conflict, participants were keen to increase cooperation between the three countries on development of technology and capability. Implicit in this approach is that more technologically advanced economies would be more successful and by extension have a greater economic (and technological) base to support military development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concerns among participants on the needed urgency of modernization also led to discussion that “delivering at speed is what matters.” Successful technology cooperation, one expert suggested, should work on “components before systems, systems before capabilities.” Several comments emphasized the objective of starting small so countries could “work out patterns of cooperation” before attempting more complex endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overclassification of information (as distinct from intelligence) limits faster progress on a range of technology and production efforts. Discussions noted that within the U.S. government, the default seems to be marking a document with a no foreign (or NOFORN) handling instruction. For those working within the government, it is the safest because it is the most restrictive. However, those restrictions greatly inhibit future cooperation as it is time consuming to change information from NOFORN to a releasable (“REL”) state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discussions also highlighted the value of not only being the first to a technology, but, in an increasingly competitive world, developing the institutional capability to be a “fast follower.” This entails learning from others’ successes and rapidly adopting — or surpassing — the original discoverer. One participant noted that the PLA is “focused on innovating and scaling as a fast follower,” implying its goal was to rapidly incorporate technology developed by others into its operations, rather than develop its own.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;areas-of-difference-1&quot;&gt;Areas of Difference&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indian participants emphasized the importance of technology transfers to India so it can increase its domestic military capability production while simultaneously modernizing its military. Indian participants emphasized that India believed technology transfer should happen with minimal preconditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Australian participants emphasized a range of concerns regarding tech cooperation — and the restrictions on it — that inhibit Australia’s national efforts to remain interoperable with U.S. forces while satisfying its defense matériel requirements. Such issues include Australia’s efforts to acquire or build production facilities for precision-guided munitions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both Indian and Australian participants pointed out the difficulties in working through U.S. regulatory processes, such as the International Trafficking in Arms Regulations. Even successful processes can require an 18-month review. Cooperating “at speed” will necessitate faster processes, possibly based on a “presumption of approval rather than a presumption of denial.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An area of marked difference was an exchange about continued Indian reliance on advanced Russian equipment, such as its S-400 missile system, and U.S. and Australian concerns that those systems could pose a security risk to U.S. or Australian systems. Discussion considered two specific concerns: first, that sensitive technical information would be exposed through system interaction (sensors or communications data), and second, that Russian contractors operating Russian systems near U.S.- or Australian-originated equipment could collect intelligence that would diminish the U.S. or Australian advantage. Indian participants recalled India’s successful history of maintaining security of foreign-acquired systems and doubted U.S. or Australian concerns would be realized.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-of-technology-discussion&quot;&gt;Implications of Technology Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discussion focused on the importance of developing and adopting technology rapidly to deter and prevail in future conflict. Current development capabilities in the United States, Australia, and India fall short of this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concerns about the plausibility of tech transfer, as well as risks that efforts will be cut short due to export restrictions applied partway through the effort, limit more robust cooperation on technology development among the three countries. These issues will have to be mitigated, if not resolved, to begin cooperating at the pace and scale necessary to achieve leaders’ goals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. participants voiced concerns that requests for technology transfers often originate from partner governments to the United States. The U.S. government, however, “cannot direct companies to share their technology or set up business.” Additionally, one U.S. participant shared their frustration that even when the United States fast-tracks approval for capabilities requested by India, India sometimes chooses another bidder for the capability, creating questions within the United States as to whether the effort to fast-track a decision is worthwhile given other competing global priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;great-power-conflict-will-require-greater-industrial-capacity&quot;&gt;Great Power Conflict Will Require Greater Industrial Capacity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;discussion&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine demonstrates that militaries in future wars will need to draw on significant stocks of precision-guided munitions. Close fighting will require enormous quantities of traditional munitions, including artillery and small arms ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Against this assessment, U.S. and Australian participants noted that their countries lacked adequate production facilities to create “magazine depth” as well as insufficient industrial capacity to ramp up production of those capabilities once a conflict began.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to one comment early in the discussions, future war will be a “massive expenditure of munitions, production, and resupply” based on current industrial manufacturing capacity. “We just don’t have that [capacity].” Efforts to address that manufacturing shortfall are beginning in the United States and Australia, but do not seem to be happening at sufficient scope or pace to meet potential conflict timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recent unclassified wargaming by CSIS suggests that the United States could run out of precision munitions in the first week or two of a major conflict. One participant suggested that in certain stocks, the United States might “run out in less than a week.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;India’s assessment was mixed, claiming it retained substantial capacity to produce “basic” equipment such as ammunition and tanks. Indian participants noted India’s limitation in production such as precision-guided munitions or advanced air capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants agreed that their countries’ governments continue to engage in exercises of peacetime bureaucratic complacency regarding technology control, technology transfer, and company-to-company partnerships. Yet, the time to reverse those trends is now if they are to meet expected future needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States, Australia, and India are working to expand domestic production of such munitions and include efforts to create surge capacity. However, “precision-guided munitions take 18 months, in some cases, to produce.” The consequence is that waiting for the onset of conflict to activate contingency production makes those plans too late.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creating additional standing production is both expensive and potentially provocative. Thus, efforts to deter through developing (and demonstrating) sufficient production capacity to meet a current or future threat will require risk acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changing-nuclear-norms&quot;&gt;Changing Nuclear Norms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;discussion-1&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s nuclear force is a growing concern as it expands and modernizes. China is pursuing new warheads and delivery systems absent an articulation of what changes in its security environment are driving such significant investment, and without dialogue with regional states about their concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One participant noted that China is “shifting from a small to a medium nuclear power.” Further, its expanded and more capable nuclear force may lead China to, at a minimum, assess a shift in its nuclear “no first use” policy. It could, for example, move to a “launch on warning or launch on attack posture.” While that could be “undertaken as an operational shift without a rhetorical change,” either could be destabilizing to the region and precipitate several defense posture shifts from neighboring states concerned that China may threaten them with such weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Deterrence is being tested, as Russia stares defeat in the face. Will it use nuclear weapons?” Participants agreed that Russia’s threats to use nuclear weapons, including tactical nuclear weapons, in Ukraine undermined a clear standard against their use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ongoing development of dual-capable missiles and tactical nuclear weapons increases the risk that targeted states must respond more rapidly in a crisis, raising the risk of unintentional nuclear escalation or exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These ongoing changes in nuclear force development and discussion of how those forces might be employed suggests “there is an emerging nuclear world order.” However, it is not clear if the emerging order is based on similar principles of transparency or mutual vulnerability as the currently prevailing nuclear order is.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-of-nuclear-norms-discussion&quot;&gt;Implications of Nuclear Norms Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The discussion surfaced two additional concerns. First, few mechanisms currently exist for engaging in meaningful dialogue on risk reduction from nuclear weapons. Cold War (or post–Cold War) mechanisms are eroding or have lapsed, and none include China. As one participant summarized, “future arms control efforts are only possible with China at the table,” but it is not clear what would bring China to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, retaliatory deterrence is losing credibility. This is based on a combination of at least two factors: one, that national publics are not prepared for the potential of nuclear exchange, and two, that at least one nuclear weapons state has stated it would not use nuclear weapons in response to nuclear weapons used by a third country. These two positions, as judged by discussion participants, may actually “raise the likelihood that such weapons will be used” if the risk of retaliation is not credible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Findings and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section presents findings and recommendations focused on the United States and its government, unless otherwise specified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; The high degree of alignment between leaders in all three countries represents an important opening for progress. Close leader alignment is driving adoption of a wider range of high-priority issues between the countries, including through the Quad. Topics include diplomacy, commerce, defense, development, and research and development. Capitalizing on the current window of alignment will require prioritization both within and among these areas to deliver near-term demonstrable wins. Expectations are high in each system for such deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, at present, alignment is not translating into sufficient outcomes from the three countries’ governments. Achieving those outcomes will require transformations from each bureaucracy, though the needed level of change to redirect effectively may prove too uncomfortable, delaying progress and contributing to the belief that cooperation is too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Leaders at every level in government agencies should prioritize the internal focus necessary to ensure that old habits of internal operation and customary approaches to regulatory procedures no longer inhibit necessary progress to meet the challenge all three countries are facing. This may require explicit instruction to their organizations, updates to regulations (or their interpretation) with clear milestones for delivery, or establishing additional review and approval protocols based on different criteria than the existing processes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Within the United States, to ensure necessary senior-level attention, the National Security Council should convene an Intergovernmental Policy Committee (IPC) process to task and monitor progress on one key initiative from each responsible department. To ensure focus, the president should ask for a progress report at least monthly during his one-on-one meetings with the secretary of state, secretary of commerce, and secretary of defense. The most pressing areas of focus are on reducing delays in cooperation caused by export controls and document classification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s unexplained nuclear modernization and expansion, Russia’s threats to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine and recent decay in the arms control and monitoring regimes raise the prospect that nuclear threat (and the prospect of use) is being normalized. Further, nuclear weapons states expressing unwillingness to use nuclear weapons in response to nuclear weapons employment lowers the potential consequence of engaging in threats as well as employment for coercive purposes. To reduce the risk of nuclear threat or employment, responsible states must reestablish norms around nuclear weapons, including both offensive and defense employment, as well as the taboo against threatening their use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Reinvigorate public awareness and debate within each of the three countries’ publics — especially in the United States and India — about when, where, and why the state might choose to use nuclear weapons. In the United States, this effort is best led from the White House. The Department of Defense can play a role by articulating current and planned concepts of operation for nuclear force employment, including in defense or in extended deterrence, in speeches and testimony by the secretary of defense and other senior Defense Department leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Develop new channels for dialogue, including with China and with Russia, about respective views of nuclear weapons. These may lead to arms control or limitation discussions, but the current lack of meaningful dialogue on the issue creates greater risk of miscalculation or inadvertent nuclear escalation. New dialogue mechanisms will likely need to find ways to include nuclear weapons states that are not members of the UN Security Council to be effective. India and Pakistan should be included, and dialogue mechanisms should include methods to incorporate other plausible or expected nuclear states should such circumstances arise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Limitations on technology transfer, information sharing, and other key elements of capability development severely impede the ability to collaboratively develop, produce, or employ new technologies or capabilities with U.S. allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of Defense, the Department of State, and the Department of Commerce should engage with the business community and one another to better understand the current sticking points delaying a positive response and quickly identify ways to improve the system. The Department of Defense can lead either by driving the process alone or by leveraging an outside organization. The second course may lead to more credible results as contractors will likely be reluctant to directly criticize their customer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Regarding information and intelligence sharing, raise the bar for classifying U.S. documents no foreign (also known as NOFORN) so that it is not the default classification. Identify categories of information that should, as default, be releasable (REL) to specific partners based on criteria such as sensitivity of the topic and confidence in the other country’s information security practices, the cost-benefit of the information shared, and the outcome sought. The Departments of State and Defense should review the impacts of requiring non-delegable three-star-level approval to apply a NOFORN handling instruction on non-intelligence products.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Technology advances are necessary but not sufficient for fielding effective and modernized capabilities. Doing so requires incorporating emerging technologies with operational concepts, operator abilities and training, institutional support, and the overall capability system. Achieving this on a national basis is difficult. Implementation on a bilateral or multinational basis will be even more difficult. Incorporating emerging technologies and concepts that rely less on “bespoke capabilities, but provide effective, lower-cost options” will be necessary in future capability development. Success will require new forms of engagement internal to each of the three countries’ own processes and acceptance of higher risk tolerance for engaging earlier with allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of Defense, especially the military services, should increase the use of prototyping throughout the development process. Further, it should ensure prototype developers have steady interaction with operators on how, where, and why they would use such a prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure that new research efforts, systems design, prototyping, and experimentation include (when appropriate) allies and partners, to leverage a diverse range of experience and perspectives, and to ensure rapid convertibility of technologies to capabilities that can be used by a wide range of key U.S. partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Australia, India, and the United States remain focused on shared threats, yet have limited mechanisms to coordinate and exchange information in real time for crisis management or response. Such mechanisms will be most effective when developed, exercised, and refined before a crisis starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Hold a series of tabletop exercises at the track 1.5 or track 2 level that present crisis scenarios and push participants to identify potential gaps in their countries’ capabilities, access, or information that they may need to reach out to partners to secure, or that partners may need to reach out to them for assistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;岑敖暉抗爭派記者會稱「期待國安處因議員狂投否決票，而將我哋送入監牢」 多名被告大笑&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;民主動力帖文有「光復議會」「對抗暴政」字眼 趙家賢向法官認錯&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;趙家賢：抗爭派記者會「完全失控」 翌日退岀初選因「無法DQ佢哋唯有DQ自己」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ValtJp9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（6日）踏入審訊第39天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢供稱，在抗爭派記者會後清楚知道要立即退出初選，批會上言論「完全地失控」和「踩界」。控方庭上完整播放記者會片段，抗爭派表示他們已成為主流，重申會堅定否決財政預算案。其中岑敖暉稱立法會議員有權否決每一個法案及議案，並強調如果這樣都是涉嫌顛覆國家的話，「我非常之期待北京或者國安處、或者係林鄭，因為一個議員狂投否決票，而將我哋送入監牢，樂見其成」。這時延伸庭的岑敖暉、黃之鋒及吳敏兒均一同大笑；袁嘉蔚更邊笑邊拍手。在正庭的鄒家成和吳政亨也相視而笑。本案中有32人已還柙至今逾兩年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;抗爭派稱已成主流-岑敖暉指若暴政當道會堅定否決財案若有真普選有磋商空間&quot;&gt;抗爭派稱已成主流 岑敖暉指若「暴政當道」會堅定否決財案、若有真普選有磋商空間&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢今繼續作供。控方庭上播放抗爭派在2020年7月15日舉行的記者會片段，他們於會上發言指抗爭派已成為主流，又強調否決議案是代議士的合法權利，重申他們會否決預算案，並將繼續提倡「議會攬炒」。播放片段時，趙家賢大部分時間微微低頭，間中會抬頭看前方投影的大螢幕或身旁法庭傳譯主任的電腦屏幕，他面前的電腦屏幕則繼續被3張白紙遮蓋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑敖暉首先讀出「抗爭派立法會參選人立場聲明」，表示「初選塵埃落定，抗爭派已成為主流」，並稱：「為咗不負港人期望，民主陣營當務之急，係要團結迎擊北京傀儡政府」。他指北京早已為破壞他們團結設下陷阱，一紙確認書簽署與否成為爭議，但取消資格與否從來不是取決於有否簽署文件。他表示：「我哋一眾抗爭派在此聲明，無論確認書最終會否加入與《國安法》有關內容，我哋都會義無反顧反對《國安法》」，並指會約見泛民主派的初選勝選人，磋商有關簽署的取態。在延伸庭的岑托着頭專心觀看片段，不時微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有記者問到抗爭派進入立法會後，是否會按照承諾否決財政預算案，岑敖暉重申：「我哋係會好堅定行使基本法賦予畀代議士嘅權力，所以答案係是嘅」。他補充：「如果香港係已經落實咗五大訴求，如果係有真普選嘅話，我相信我哋係會有磋商嘅空間，但係如果仍然今日係暴政當道、魔警橫行嘅話…我相信我哋係無論咩內容，都係會否決財政預算案嘅」。此時鄒家成及吳政亨相視而笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑敖暉非常期待國安處因議員狂投否決票而將佢哋送入監牢&quot;&gt;岑敖暉：非常期待國安處因議員狂投否決票，而將佢哋送入監牢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑敖暉回答記者提問時亦指：「一個代議士，一個立法會議員係絕對有權利喺每一個法案、每一個議案、每一個撥款都係投否決，呢一個係喺《基本法》賦予立法會議員非常之清晰嘅權利」，他堅定地強調：「如果咁樣係涉嫌顛覆國家嘅話，我非常之期待北京或者國安處、或者係林鄭，因為一個議員狂投否決票，而將我哋送入監牢，樂見其成」。這時延伸庭的岑敖暉、黃之鋒及吳敏兒均一同大笑；袁嘉蔚更邊笑邊拍手。至於在正庭的鄒家成及吳政亨也相視而笑，林卓廷亦微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑指開記者會目的冀不同路線的分歧完結&quot;&gt;岑指開記者會目的冀不同路線的分歧完結&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑敖暉亦解釋今次召開記者會的核心原因，因在初選當中有不同路線的分歧，是一場「路線之爭」，但今次並非只是民主派的內部選舉，更是面向國際及世界的選舉，但希望有初選結果之後，雙方的分歧可以完結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;梁晃維繼續提倡議會攬炒路線&quot;&gt;梁晃維：繼續提倡議會攬炒路線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在港島區初選勝出的梁晃維則表示，抗爭派會「繼續去阻止極權擴張」，並稱政權今日提倡「議會攬炒就係顛覆國家政權」，但他強調一旦進入立法會，「無論我哋係對政府嘅提案，定係財政預算案去投下反對票，呢一個都係我哋作為代議士嘅一個合法權利」。他明言抗爭派會「繼續提倡議會攬炒路線」，迫使政府向人民低頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑敖暉指抗爭派會與戴耀廷區諾軒趙家賢共同承擔責任&quot;&gt;岑敖暉指抗爭派會與戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢共同承擔責任&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁又表示，選管會稱初選並非立法會選舉的一部分，「政權如果佢真係有任何實質證據，真係能夠攞出任何嘅法律條文，證明今次初選嘅參選人、籌辦人，或者投票嘅市民，係干犯任何法例嘅話，我懇請佢哋立即嚴正執法」。他亦強調作為參選人，「我哋亦都會同今次初選嘅籌辦人共同面對，眼前有機會發生嘅一切困難」。在延伸庭的黃之鋒及岑敖暉不禁竊笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑敖暉於會上亦表示，主辦初選的戴耀廷、區諾軒及民主動力「勞苦功高」。正觀看片段的岑及黃之鋒均微笑。岑續指理解在這階段退出的戰友，他強調今次初選不單是主辦3人的事，「係我哋所有唔同陣營參選人嘅事，更加係我哋60萬選民一齊作出嘅決定」，並表示：「起碼呢度咁多人，一定係會同戴耀廷教授、趙家賢博士以及區諾軒共同承擔嘅責任」。此時鄒家成邊聽邊點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃之鋒指特朗普再簽香港法案-籲北京政府懸崖勒馬&quot;&gt;黃之鋒指特朗普再簽香港法案 籲北京政府「懸崖勒馬」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中有抗爭派提及國際對初選的關注。黃之鋒稱「美國總統特朗普再次簽署有關香港的法案」，他嚴正呼籲北京政府懸崖勒馬，因《國安法》通過是促成國際「圍堵中共」的主因。張崑陽則指，國際社會大肆報導初選，其中路透社更形容初選是「改朝換代」，而美國國務卿蓬佩奧更表態指，港澳辦及中聯辦聲言初選違《國安法》，是恫嚇香港人的表現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，王百羽指，最大公因數是堅決否對財政預算案，如果五大訴求沒有落實的話。這時鄒家成笑着點頭。黃子悅則指本土派與抗爭派在初選中的大捷是屬於「手足」，「我哋唔係暴徒，只係勇於反抗暴政嘅義民」，指議會需要抗爭路上同行的人。衞生服務界的余慧明表示，抗爭派在功能組別中必不可少，批評傳統功能組別只顧自己界別內的選民，而在部份表決投票中「突然變身保皇黨」。她強調功能組別都要面對香港群眾，初選結果亦反映市民唾棄泛民主派，希望更多人會出選挑戰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FjLax8C.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（6日）踏入審訊第39天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢繼續作供，確認民主動力作為初選承辦機構，為初選進行眾籌、招募、宣傳和為參選人申報開支等。法官陳慶偉問及民主動力在2020年6月宣布眾籌的帖文內，提及「光復議會」和「對抗暴政」的意思，趙指當時民間社會覺得受到「好強大嘅政治打壓」，以「對抗暴政」表達憤慨，並在法官追問下指相信「暴政」是指當時的香港政府。被問該些字眼是否民主動力的政治立場，趙稱「絕對不是」，並說「抱歉法官閣下，我要認錯」，「我冇做好謹慎責任嘅角色」，有被告說「嘩」，多人發笑。趙在追問下指民主動力並非「政治中立」，是屬民主陣營的組織。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認民主動力為初選眾籌340多萬招募逾2500義工&quot;&gt;趙確認民主動力為初選眾籌340多萬、招募逾2,500義工&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢繼續作供。控方展示民主動力6月9日的Facebook帖文，以「2020年立法會選舉-民主派35+公民投票及眾籌行動」為題，提及為初選進行眾籌和招募，目標金額350萬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢確認民主動力為了初選和該會的經費而進行眾籌，並指當時戴耀廷計算過約需300至400萬開支，並在6月9日記者會上指需400萬，而趙為了讓關注人士較容易記得「35+」的目標，故將金額調低至350萬，最終籌得340多萬元。趙又指就相關眾籌，「我哋都特別由我提出，係根據返選舉事務處嘅選舉指引嘅精神」，呼籲捐贈1,000元或以下的「小額眾籌」，他們最後亦將多於1,000元的款項排除在初選的開支經費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就招募的人員數目，趙指各區有區議員、社區主任和義工等協助，但沒有仔細問總幹事，不能確切回答，但指共有250多個票站，各票站有站長和核心義工，另有一些義工協助排隊、維持秩序和宣傳，每個票站約有10人，大致上共有逾2,500人。法官陳仲衡問工作人員有否報酬，趙指民主動力秘書處就此項目聘請的兼職會有報酬，而各票站義工吃飯、食水、電芯等物資，會先由該票站站長先墊支，再向民主動力報銷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認民主動力為參選人申報開支於蘋果日報等媒體賣廣告宣傳初選&quot;&gt;趙確認民主動力為參選人申報開支、於《蘋果日報》等媒體賣廣告宣傳初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪續要求趙總結民主動力在初選的工作，趙重申民主動力因戴耀廷和區諾軒的邀請，而「承辦咗初選呢個活動項目」，「我哋係初選呢個活動嘅承辦機構」。而就此「活動項目」，民主動力向公眾進行眾籌收集資金開展活動，亦是所有初選參選人的「選舉服務提供者」，民主動力會就提供過的服務以選舉捐贈的形式給予所有參選人，為他們填寫和遞交選舉開支申報書，以附合選舉法例。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙亦確認，民主動力負責準備和收集提名表格，並在Facebook帖文發布連結供人下載。民主動力亦有參與宣傳，呼籲市民參與7月11及12日的投票，趙指作為承辦機構有責任讓公眾認知其承辦項目，確認他曾指示秘書處在傳統紙媒及網媒賣廣告，舉例《蘋果日報》手機應用程式內亦有初選的電子廣告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問民主動力帖文光復議會對抗暴政意思-趙一度指不同人有不同解讀&quot;&gt;官問民主動力帖文「光復議會」、「對抗暴政」意思 趙一度指不同人有不同解讀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後主動就帖文內容發問，趙確認帖文中提及眾籌和招募義工均是民主動力的工作，指他們承辦活動時的分工，「呢啲人力資源嘅安排都係我哋去做統籌」；又確認帖文多數由總幹事草擬，他就大項目會審視並進行修訂，再作發布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;帖文中提及「#團結一致 #立會過半 #光復議會 #對抗暴政 #711及712投票 #民主派 #35plus #公民投票」。陳慶偉問及，「#光復議會」的意思是什麼？趙望住螢幕思考數秒指，「喺我嘅理解係立法會過咗一半，民主派就能夠將議會個功能能夠光復到，就實行到民主派一啲嘅政策倡議」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問文中有「#對抗暴政」，「你是指哪個暴政？」，趙沒有正面回答，僅指「當時嘅社會環境底下，支持民主嘅民間社會，覺得係受到好強大嘅政治打壓，而對抗暴政嘅意思都係表達緊呢種憤慨」，並指「當然係講緊現有政權」。陳追問，是現有的香港政府抑或中國政府？抑或兩者皆是？趙指「我只可以講，唔同人睇到呢個字眼會按佢自己嘅思維有不同嘅解讀」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱對抗暴政等絕對不是民動立場-向法官認錯指無做好謹慎責任角色&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱「對抗暴政」等絕對不是民動立場 向法官認錯指無做好謹慎責任角色&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指着電腦螢幕：「你的Facebook專頁，你告訴我」，趙再答「我相信係講緊當時嘅香港政府」。陳問，這是否也是當時民主動力的政治立場？趙答：「回應法官閣下，我作為召集人，我要講嘅係絕對不是」，陳續問若然如此，為何會有該些字眼？此時趙說：「抱歉法官閣下，我要認錯」，有被告大聲說「嘩」，鄒家成、何桂藍等多人發笑。趙續說：「我冇做好謹慎責任嘅角色，原因係職員草擬咗比我嘅時候，我着重睇嘅位置，當時冇特別留意到呢個位」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續問，那民主動力是否沒有政治立場、是政治中立，只是作為承辦人（contractor）的角色？趙指他們當然是承辦人，「但我哋當然亦都係作為傳統民主派嘅一個協調組織，同埋一個協作交流嘅平台，所以我唔可以話係政治中立，因為民主動力本身都係一個喺民主陣營裡面嘅組織」。陳續問，故因此帖文該部分是一個完全的錯誤？趙指，若當時有做好謹慎責任，在該句便不會加入「#光復議會 #對抗暴政」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙家賢上周稱雙眼看眼前電腦螢幕較「辛苦」，法庭終以3張白紙遮蓋他面前電腦螢幕。趙的電腦今續被白紙遮蓋，趙作供時大部分時間望向身旁傳譯主任的電腦螢幕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ylUQ8tU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（6日）踏入審訊第39天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢繼續作供，提及兩辦譴責初選或違法後，戴耀廷嘗試「力挽狂瀾」將各人拉回紅線內，惟抗爭派卻在沒有知會大會下，召開記者會表明否決預算案、望引致國際制裁，是「完全地失控」、「踩界」和抵觸《國安法》，令他覺得要立即退出初選。趙又指，民主動力在提名表格加入承諾擁護《基本法》及效忠特區的條款，因知道這是民選公職人員「應有之義」，惟抗爭派言論絕對不合乎該條款；而趙只是「服務提供者」，非如選委會般有實權，「我唔能夠DQ佢哋嘅話，我唯有喺呢個時候DQ自己」，「比公眾傳媒好清楚認知係一個切割」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙家賢透露民主動力原定會委託香港民研進行選前民調，惟因已退出初選，故沒有繼續。他並透露，眾籌所得的大額款項部分納為民主動力經費，而戴耀廷曾表示望預留80至100萬元予香港民研研發新的民間投票系統，民主動力並將剩餘資金捐予香港民研和慈善機構。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指區諾軒致電稱將退出初選-並指趙要自行解散&quot;&gt;趙指區諾軒致電稱將退出初選 並指趙要自行解散&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今就趙家賢退出初選的情況發問。趙家賢表示，區諾軒在7月14日曾致電他指「佢自己將會退出初選，而佢都想我一齊退出」，並指已聯絡時任政制及內地事務局政治助理吳璟儁；而由於建制派傳媒、中央駐港機構、及國務院均大肆抨擊初選涉違《國安法》，區表示根據其判斷及獲得的意見，是需要將初選停止。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指他當時問區，「初選都做咗出嚟、已經投咗票，我哋有啲咩補救措施、remedies可以做呢？」，區指唯有作為主辦機構的他，及作為承辦機構的民主動力，「要自行解散（初選）」，亦表示自己將於7月15日宣布退出，趙則稱待區退出後，民主動力會一同退出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱退出初選因事情已由本地政治層面提升到國家層面&quot;&gt;趙稱退出初選因事情已由本地政治層面提升到國家層面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢其後於7月16日在Facebook發出「初選完成：退出參與協調工作聲明」，表示：「本人擔任召集人的民主動力獲主導民主派協調工作的戴耀廷副教授及區諾軒前議員委託承辦『民主派35+公民投票（初選）』，最終結果已公布，本人的協作角色已告完成。經慎重考慮各方意見，為對身邊人士、民主動力執委會及所屬組織等負責，本人現宣佈退出參與本屆立法會選舉的協調工作。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問趙為何退出，趙表示於7月13日晚得知戴耀廷對初選是否完全合法開始有疑問，而翌日《蘋果日報》政治版資深記者提醒他戴〈真攬炒十步〉一文並著他小心，區諾軒亦表示會退出「35+」，再加上建制陣營與中央政府對初選的看法，趙強調：「我會睇到個事情已經係由香港本地政治層面，提升到去國家嘅層面」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴耀廷力挽狂瀾望初選免踩紅線-惟抗爭派召記者會完全失控&quot;&gt;趙稱戴耀廷力挽狂瀾望初選免踩紅線 惟抗爭派召記者會「完全失控」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，7月14日戴耀廷曾向所有參選人發訊息稱「不提否決每一個議案，也不說癱瘓政府」，趙認為此舉除了是統一口徑外，「佢（戴耀廷）都可以講係力挽狂瀾，希望將初選拉返唔好踩到呢個紅線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過，他指縱使本土抗爭派收到戴的訊息，仍然在「冇同我哋大會有任何溝通嘅時候」，自行於7月15日召開抗爭派記者會，「佢哋不單止無視咗戴耀廷7月14號統一口徑嘅短訊，更加係重複好重視除咗會否決財政預算案，仲會係所有議案都會否決」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指事前沒有收到通知會有該記者會，強調該記者會與民主動力「完全冇任何嘅關係」。趙認為，抗爭派的發言是希望迫使政府考慮DQ議員和解散立法會，「從而係去到國際層面令到國際關注，而去制裁中央政府」，並加重語氣指：「整件事係完全地失控！」，鄒家成和在延伸庭的黃之鋒聞後不禁發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指抗爭派發言與國安法踩界-他無權dq他們唯有dq自己&quot;&gt;趙指抗爭派發言與《國安法》踩界 他無權DQ他們「唯有DQ自己」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，他特別在民主動力準備的提名表格上，加上參選人要承諾擁護《基本法》及效忠香港特別行政區的條款，明言「呢個係我哋民主動力好清楚知道，擔任民選公職人員嘅應有之義」，黃之鋒再次發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟趙指，抗爭派的發言「絕對不合乎」上述條款，「喺我嘅角度，絕對係同《國安法》係踩界㗎喇！」但他無奈表示，初選只是民間選舉，「我唔係真係好似時任選委會主席同法官咁有個實權」，再加上他只是一個「服務提供者」，「我唔能夠DQ佢哋嘅話，我唯有喺呢個時候DQ自己」，鄒家成發笑，在延伸庭的被告聞後亦大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱原定初選投票後委託香港民研做民意調查-同意民調屬35計劃重要部分&quot;&gt;趙稱原定初選投票後委託香港民研做民意調查 同意民調屬「35+計劃」重要部分&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續解釋，若選舉繼續正常進行，初選後原定有一些協調工作要處理，包括由區諾軒及戴耀廷兩位協調人負責協調勝出參選人的出選名單；而官方投票前的一星期，原定由民主動力委託香港民意研究所進行選前民意調查。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;但趙指，由於區諾軒致電他時提及《國安法》第33條（自動放棄犯罪可減刑的條文），並建議他終止計劃，加上初選結果已公布，「喺呢方面都冇得去做任何補救措施，咁所以我只可以公開簡單講，話個協作角色已經完成啦」。法官陳仲衡問到，事實上民主動力仍有工作要做？趙回應：「喺正常情況底下，根據當時計劃，係仲有嘢要做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問到，若趙家賢沒有退出協調工作，香港民研的民意調查是否「35+計劃」一個重要而不可少（integral）的部分？趙同意，指以往選前民調只是以滾動形式讓市民每周得知支持度趨勢，而是次民調計劃在選前一星期公布結果，部分選區會視乎支持度來決定最後出選名單，亦可按形勢「指示」各區如何分配選票，形容「有一定作用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱退出後無付錢予民研做民調-部分眾籌資金作為民動經費部分捐民研及慈善機構&quot;&gt;趙稱退出後無付錢予民研做民調 部分眾籌資金作為民動經費、部分捐民研及慈善機構&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷在趙退出後同日，亦發文宣布「因過去幾個月的勞累，我希望在未來的一段日子，爭取多一些休息時間，也可以更專注於學術的工作。當然，我不是甚麼也不再做，我必會與所有認同民主普選的香港人走在一起，在各自的位置，為達成這目標，繼續努力，直至民主普選臨到香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙表示，戴發文前他「完全冇收到任何訊息」，當日亦沒有與戴討論其帖文或「35+計劃」。但趙記得之後約一星期，戴有問他是否仍會付錢予香港民研鍾庭耀進行選前民調，趙回應「我哋民主動力已經退出，就唔想繼續之後嘅事情，所以就冇畀錢」。趙續指，戴在官方選舉提名期結束、宣布延期前，亦曾向他發訊息指香港民研或會另外找資源做有關民意調查，至於之後民研會否有就「35+」的工作，趙沒有仔細問下去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問眾籌資金有何去向，趙表示每個細項少於1,000元的資金才會撥入初選開支，其餘則會視作捐予民主動力的會務經費，及支持民意調查的資金。趙指，戴耀廷曾提及望撥出80至100萬予香港民研，指民主派對反對預算案有顧慮，望能研發新的民間投票系統。趙在其後執委會會議上，建議將餘下資金部分捐予香港民研用作民意調查，但沒指定某一項目；至於其他資金則再捐助予一些根據《稅務條例》88條註冊的慈善機構。趙指於2020年8月底至9月捐款予民研。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡亦問到，趙的帖文兩度使用「本人」一詞，他是否以個人名義、而非民主動力的名義退出？趙指根據民主動力執委會的章程，他作為召集人，「係整體領導成個組織嘅工作」，早前執委會亦清楚他代表民主動力承辦整個初選的工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙原打算區諾軒退出後視乎情況決定何時退出-惟抗爭派記者會後思維轉變要清楚切割&quot;&gt;趙原打算區諾軒退出後視乎情況決定何時退出 惟抗爭派記者會後思維轉變要清楚「切割」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰其後主動提及，趙宣布退出協調工作的前一日，曾轉發區諾軒宣布退出的帖文，並提到「在恐懼瀰漫的氛圍，會謹守崗位，堅持合法實務工作」。李問趙前一日已知道區諾軒會退出，但似乎他在15日仍希望繼續初選工作，那為何到了16日又宣布退出？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙解釋，7月14日與區諾軒通話時，「當時我哋傾好係佢首先退出，而我會再睇住個事情，睇吓邊個位合適而作出退出」，並指因始終有行政工作要處理，而平時就初選的論述和回應傳媒，均是由計劃的「倡導、領導者」戴耀廷處理，故當時認為可以「再睇幾日」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，其思維「好特別嘅轉變」，就是在7月15日「完全冇認知、冇提示」下，本土抗爭派召開記者會，重申他們的發言絕對不合乎擁護《基本法》和效忠特區的條款。趙再強調，「整件事已經係完全失控」，指他們「仲要係以初選勝出者去講明，會好貫徹地就住戴耀廷協調嘅共識，去繼續行落去同參選」。趙強調，他作為民主動力召集人，「我對我嘅組織同埋身邊嘅同事等等係要負責」，「咁我只可以喺當時就係好清楚嘅要退出之後嘅工作，畀公眾傳媒好清楚認知係一個切割」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱作為有恆常思維的人-認為抗爭派提及的行動會抵觸國安法故退出初選&quot;&gt;趙稱作為有「恆常思維」的人 認為抗爭派提及的行動會抵觸《國安法》故退出初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉提議應觀看趙家賢提及的抗爭派記者會片段，李運騰亦指望了解會上各人實際說過的話。控方下午播放長約1小時的抗爭派記者會片段，播畢後主控萬德豪問趙家賢，記者會與他指「思維轉變」有否關係。趙指「有好重要嘅關係」，指看到記者會直播「就令到我會覺得係即刻要去退出（初選）」，並指退出聲明其實於15日晚已準備好，但他曾與一些團體討論過「出Facebook最有利嘅時候，就係朝頭早11點左右」，故最終於翌日該時段發帖。在延伸庭的袁嘉蔚及黃之鋒不禁竊笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉打斷指控方問題是記者會上有什麼令趙改變心意。趙續表示，記者會上抗爭派曾表達抗爭派已成為主流，會將抗爭意志繼續帶入議會進行「攬炒」，進行肢體衝突或對議案投下否決票；亦提及政府可能會DQ本土派候選人或立法會議員，他們會否決預算案迫使特首解散立會。趙續指，會上提及國際社會留意到事態發展就會「圍堵中共」，亦提及美國有簽署法案制裁中國與香港的官員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙再次強調，聽到記者會內容時「好確知」抗爭派聲稱的行動並非能捍衞基本法和效忠特區的「心意」，亦認為他們提到的流程會抵觸《國安法》。趙補充他當然並非法律學者或有關方面的律師專家，只是作為有「恆常思維」的人士、一個「合理的人（reasonable man）」而有上述看法，並認為代表民主動力籌辦初選，一定要對組織和身邊人負責，故當時「好清楚知道要即刻係去退出（初選）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴曾提及國安法生效後參與者言行或對計劃產生影響-指有人有啲過咗界&quot;&gt;趙稱戴曾提及《國安法》生效後參與者言行或對計劃產生影響 指有人「有啲過咗界」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙又補充，區諾軒曾向他提及《國安法》第33條要用方法終止初選計劃，而他在抗爭派記者會前一日，亦意識到初選協調整個「活動項目」已變成戴耀廷「攬炒十步」的一部分。趙續指，戴7月14日發訊息「諗住力挽狂瀾將大家嘅言行統一」、「將大家由踩到紅線拉返出嚟嘅時候」，抗爭派卻「清楚講明我哋而家喺紅線裡面呀」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，趙不止一次稱戴想把大家從紅線拉出來，是戴親口告訴他，抑或趙猜測戴的意圖？趙指戴發訊息當日，二人曾以電話聯絡，戴提及當時有候選人的言論「已經有啲過咗界」，《文匯》、《大公》等建制媒體亦有報導。趙指戴當時認為普通法沒有追溯力，故不認為他以往的文章有問題；但《國安法》生效後，所有初選參與者的言行便可能對整個計劃有不同程度的影響，故戴望發訊息做到「統一口徑」，趙並意識到戴「其實想將整件事係由踩到界拉返出嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在法官追問下確認，《國安法》前戴耀廷均稱「35+計劃」合法，直至7月13日晚趙首次聽到戴不確定初選是否違法。李續問，趙看到抗爭派記者會後感到憂慮，有否與戴耀廷討論會上內容？趙指沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問確認書意思-趙稱屬行政措施最終由選舉主任決定能否入閘&quot;&gt;官問「確認書」意思 趙稱屬行政措施、最終由選舉主任決定能否入閘&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，李運騰亦指記者會上屢聽到抗爭派被問及會否簽「確認書」，問「確認書」是什麼。趙指現行選舉法例沒有列明要簽署確認書，確認書應是在2019年區議會選舉始出現，並將法例要求候選人作出聲明的條款，如列出某些《基本法》條文，要求獲提名人士再次確認簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指初選提名表格並不包括確認書內容，因已參考官方選舉表格，而擁護《基本法》條款亦包含所有《基本法》條文和附件；而抗爭派當時是關注確認書會否要求擁護《國安法》。趙並指，2019年區選時有候選人沒有簽確認書但能入閘，有候選人有簽但不能入閘，故確認書只是「行政措施」，「最終都應該係由個選舉主任決定嗰個人係能唔能夠入閘」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周二（11日）續審。臨散庭前，控方表示已就其中一名控方證人申請匿名令，若辯方有反對望於下周三前提出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-post-post-cold-war-era&quot;&gt;The Post-Post-Cold War Era&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among its other effects, Vladimir Putin’s second war of aggression against Ukraine is accelerating the division of the world into opposing geopolitical, economic, and ideological blocs. Russia’s unprovoked brutality and disastrous military incompetence have further deepened its isolation from advanced industrial democracies, strengthening the bonds among them while driving Moscow into an ever-deepening dependence on Beijing. The shock of invasion has resulted in an expansion of NATO’s ranks, bolstering its northern flank and galvanizing unprecedented transatlantic security cooperation. Meanwhile, Xi Jinping’s refusal to condemn the actions of his “best and bosom friend,” and the fact that the war began only days after he and Putin proclaimed their “no limits” partnership, has heightened suspicions about Beijing’s intentions in European capitals, fueling demands in some quarters for a thorough reexamination of every aspect of policy toward China. The terrible spectacle of an enormously destructive war in the heart of Europe has also raised the perceived probability of a similar conflict in the Indo-Pacific, highlighting the need for closer strategic cooperation among the United States and its democratic allies in both regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time as they intensify divisions between East and West, recent events have raised questions about future patterns of alignment between the North and the Global South. The United States and its allies have cast their support for Ukraine as upholding the norm of sovereignty and opposing the law of the jungle by defending the weak against the depredations of the strong. Yet many governments in the developing world clearly do not view the conflict in the same light and, in any event, have been reluctant to join the West in denouncing Russian aggression. This has led some observers to predict the emergence of a new nonaligned movement, while others warn that Moscow and Beijing have stolen a march on the advanced democracies, outflanking them by winning support across the non-Western world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its recently released National Security Strategy, the Biden administration declared that “the post-Cold War Era is definitively over.” While its precise features remain to be determined, this new “post-post-Cold War” epoch already bears a striking resemblance to the early years of the superpower rivalry that followed the end of World War II. Now, as then, a pair of continental authoritarian giants are facing off against a coalition made up largely of democracies arrayed around the periphery of Eurasia and backed from across the oceans by the United States. And, as was true in the second half of the twentieth century, the two blocs have begun to compete for followers, access, and influence in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-axis-of-authoritarians&quot;&gt;An “Axis of Authoritarians”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite three decades of steadily tightening ties, skeptics continue to question the depth and durability of the connections between Moscow and Beijing. Since the start of Russia’s renewed war in Ukraine, some have suggested that the Sino-Russian partnership might be approaching a “turning point,” with Xi looking to distance himself from Putin’s misadventures and perhaps even open to the possibility of “recalibrating” relations with Russia. As has happened repeatedly in the past, however, such predictions are likely to be disproven by events. Indeed, as David Shullman and Andrea Kendall-Taylor have argued, it now seems clear that, instead of driving them apart, the war in Ukraine will end up drawing Russia and China even closer together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notion that the links between the two Eurasian giants comprise a fragile “axis of convenience,” and that theirs is nothing more than “a classic great power relationship driven by common interests rather than shared values,” is misleading on several counts. Throughout history, most geopolitical partnerships have in fact been built largely if not entirely on shared interests; what matters is how strong and enduring this commonality proves to be. In the case of Russia and China, the alignment of material interests has only grown stronger with the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since early in the post-Cold War period, both Moscow and Beijing have believed that they face a common geopolitical foe: an arrogant and overbearing American hegemon which, together with its regional allies, is determined to block their revisionist territorial ambitions and deny them a sphere of influence commensurate with their power. Over the course of the past decade, as they have sought more openly to push back against what they regard as U.S.-led containment, Xi and Putin have helped to create a self-fulfilling prophecy. Even before the latest crisis, China’s increasingly forceful attempts to assert its maritime claims, and Russia’s aggression against Georgia and then Ukraine, were beginning to galvanize precisely the sort of collective opposition that both Moscow and Beijing have long said they fear. Recent events will only serve to accelerate this cycle, stiffening democratic resistance, thereby further heightening the authoritarians’ perceptions of threat and tightening ties between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to shared strategic concerns, Russia and China have also been drawn together by the needs of their respective economies. China’s rapid development has given it an enormous appetite for minerals, cereals, and energy resources, all of which Russia has supplied in increasing quantities since the end of the Cold War. Especially since its first invasion of Ukraine, in 2014, the imposition and strengthening of sanctions has caused Russia to turn increasingly to China as an alternative to Western markets, capital, and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the interests they share are strong, it would be a mistake to understate the commonality of values and outlook that also binds the authoritarian powers together. During the Cold War, the People’s Republic and the Soviet Union ostensibly shared a commitment to Marxism-Leninism, but they soon fell out over how to interpret and apply that supposedly scientific and infallible doctrine. Russia and China may not be united today by a common ideology, but neither are they divided by one; instead, they share an intense animosity to the ideals and governing principles being propounded by liberal democracies. What Beijing refers to as the West’s “so-called universal values” — including an insistence on the sanctity of the individual, the defense of personal freedoms, the right to self-government, and the rule of law — are inimical to the precepts on which both the Russian and Chinese regimes are founded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter this threat to their legitimacy, both Moscow and Beijing have crafted alternative ideational programs that contain varying blends of authoritarianism, statism, and nationalism as well as appeals to history, “traditional values,” and cultural conservatism. These programs are not identical, but they are clearly compatible and, in any event, are far more similar to one another than either is to liberalism. Like Hitler and Mussolini, Xi and Putin represent different species of the same anti-democratic, illiberal genus. The fact that the United States is now casting its opposition to them in ideological terms, as part of a global struggle between democracy and authoritarianism, will only confirm what they already believed to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the post-Cold War era, the authoritarian great powers have been following very different trajectories, with China gaining rapidly in wealth and power and Russia experiencing a sustained and painful decline. To the surprise of many observers, this reversal of fortunes has not given rise to ever-growing friction over tangible issues or even to much open resentment in Russia about its comparative loss of status. For the most part, Moscow and Beijing have found ways to work together rather than at cross purposes, dividing the labor where their activities overlap or simply staying out of one another’s way. Chinese policymakers have generally taken care to avoid behaving in a humiliating or high-handed fashion, while their Russian counterparts have had little choice but to accept their own diminished position. Moscow’s increasing isolation after the imposition of harsh sanctions in 2014, and the devastating additional blow that has now been inflicted to its power and prestige, will hasten its relative decline, further narrowing its freedom of maneuver, diminishing its leverage, and compelling it to follow Beijing’s lead even more closely than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One further source of skepticism about Sino-Russian cohesion is the belief that, because of their divergent paths, the two authoritarian powers must have very different time horizons and strategic objectives. In this view, Russia is a weak and fading “disruptive power” whose only option for preserving its position is to undermine others by promoting instability. On the other hand, confidence in its own rise supposedly allows China to take a more relaxed and incremental approach, advancing patiently toward global leadership while remaining within the confines of the existing international system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hal Brands and Michael Beckley have recently argued to the contrary that, as growth slows and external resistance mounts, Beijing’s assessments of its own prospects will become more pessimistic and its behavior more belligerent. If this happens, the democracies could find themselves confronted by two highly aggressive authoritarian enemies at once, each willing to take major risks to achieve its aims and perhaps coordinating their actions at opposite ends of the Eurasian landmass. At least for the moment, however, there is no indication that Xi Jinping has lost faith in the ultimate triumph of the nation and the system that he leads, or that he is anywhere close to contemplating a desperate gamble to stave off terminal decline. In fact, Beijing may now believe that Russian belligerence can help it to execute its comparatively cautious strategy for gaining regional preponderance by deflecting some of the resources and attention of the United States and its allies away from Asia to Europe. This is what occurred in 2014, when the first Ukraine war helped to derail the Obama administration’s proposed “pivot” to Asia. Depending on how events play out, something similar could happen again today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that it does not suffer political collapse and regime change, an authoritarian Russia will emerge from the current conflict even weaker, more alone, and more deeply dependent on China than it was when the war began. Alexander Gabuev has even gone so far as to claim that Moscow is being transformed into “China’s new vassal.” In certain respects, the shifts will be in matters of degree rather than in kind. Cut off from other markets, Russia will have to sell yet more natural resources at still lower prices to China, often accepting renminbi in payment and using them to buy more Chinese consumer products, machine tools, semiconductors, and other manufactured goods of the sort that can no longer be obtained from Europe. Moscow’s isolation will also compel it to become an even more avid and dependable supporter of Beijing’s positions in international institutions and to accept a further expansion in China’s presence and influence in Central Asia relative to its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the war, Russia may also have to accede to demands that will have implications for the balance of military power in the Indo-Pacific, including agreeing to sell or transfer even its most advanced weapons systems to China, and perhaps cutting back arms sales to two of China’s nonaligned regional enemies, India and Vietnam. Although any understandings would likely be tacit rather than explicit, Beijing may also make clear that, in return for its continuing support, it expects Moscow to take diversionary action in Europe should it ever decide to move against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to his bungled war of aggression, Putin has no choice but to cling as tightly as possible to his partner and patron. Xi surely has greater freedom of maneuver, but given his dark assessment of Western intentions, his options with respect to Russia are also quite limited. As Shullman and Kendall-Taylor explain, Xi cannot permit Putin to be isolated, defeated, and humiliated by a U.S.-led coalition to the point where the Russian leader might actually be overthrown. In addition to setting a very dangerous precedent, such an outcome would effectively remove Moscow as a useful counterweight to the menacing collective power of the United States and its allies. Should they succeed in neutralizing Russia, the democracies would then be free to turn their full attention to encircling and containing China. Xi’s oft-expressed desire to reduce the efficacy of Western economic pressure, and his evident conviction that the risks of confrontation and war are rising, makes it even more important to secure China’s rear areas. Expanded overland flows of oil, gas, and grain can help it to hedge against the possibility of a U.S. naval blockade. Seen in this light, more cheap and reliably accessible Russian resources are not merely a bargain but a crucial lifeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s dismal prospects may mean that, in the long run, China will find itself “shackled to a corpse.” Even in the relatively near term, a shattered and defeated nation that still rejects the West and seeks Beijing’s protection could become a major liability. For the time being, however, Russia remains an indispensable partner. Beijing has expressed mild disapproval at Putin’s egregious conduct, and it has taken care thus far to avoid crossing lines that might trigger secondary sanctions from the United States and European Union. But Xi has also continued to provide diplomatic cover and economic support to help keep Russia (and Putin) afloat. A decision to go further, openly supplying Moscow with weapons and other military systems, would mark a major departure that could trigger an escalating cycle of sanctions and counter-sanctions between China and the West. Because of the likely costs and risks, Xi will probably take such a step only if he fears that Russia is on the verge of outright defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Xi’s perspective, the ideal outcome would be a return to some version of the status quo ante: a frozen conflict in which fundamental issues remain unresolved and the combatants are still at swords’ point, only now with greatly heightened animosity, tension, and the lingering threat of direct conflict between Russia and the West. Such a situation would give Russia the chance to begin to rebuild its strength, drawing it deeper into China’s embrace while at the same time continuing to distract the United States from the Indo-Pacific. If it can present itself plausibly as a peacemaker and honest broker, Beijing may even be able to regain some of its lost leverage in European capitals, perhaps enabling it to get back to the business of driving wedges between Washington and its Atlantic allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-coalition-of-democracies&quot;&gt;A Coalition of Democracies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was true during much of the Cold War, the world’s major democracies can be thought of as comprising a triangle. The United States stands at the apex, embedded in a multilateral alliance system with Europe and linked by a network of bilateral commitments to its various partners in Asia. While they are not joined together by a trans-regional mutual defense pact, European and Asian democracies nevertheless engage in various forms of intelligence sharing, joint technology development, and strategic dialogue. Thanks in part to recent events, the three vertices of this triangle have all grown stronger and more cohesive. Albeit to varying degrees, so too have the ties between each of them. Beyond the purely military realm, Europe, Asia, and the United States have also begun to move closer in their economic policies toward Russia and China and in their emphasis on the shared values that unite them and separate them from their authoritarian rivals. Whether these trends will prove enduring, resulting in a fully reconstituted, global “free world” coalition, remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-states-and-asia&quot;&gt;The United States and Asia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well before the current crisis, China’s increasing strength and its growing belligerence had begun to produce a stepped-up counterbalancing response on the part of its wealthiest and most capable neighbors. Albeit belatedly, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, and India have all undertaken major increases in defense spending in the past half-decade. Concerns over China’s growing capabilities and opaque intentions have also led to intensified consultation and cooperation, both bilaterally with the United States and in various multilateral groupings, outside the context of formal alliance commitments. First launched in 2007 and revitalized in 2017, the Quad has become a regular mechanism for promoting closer and more regular strategic coordination among Japan, Australia, the United States, and India. Starting in 2021, the United States and the United Kingdom announced their intention to cooperate to help Australia build a nuclear-powered submarine as well as to work together to develop artificial intelligence, quantum computing, hypersonic weapons, and autonomous undersea vehicles. After years of recrimination and tension, Japan and South Korea have also taken steps to normalize their relations with one another and, together with the United States, to resume regular trilateral strategic dialogue and expand military cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that they involve different actors and are taking place half a world away, events in Ukraine have given an additional impetus to all these efforts. Whether or not there has truly been an increase in the probability of war, the shocking reality of a major conflagration in the heart of Europe has increased the perceived likelihood of similar events occurring in the Indo-Pacific. Putin’s unexpected, self-destructive, and arguably irrational decision to use force to absorb another polity has highlighted the danger that autocracies led by unchecked dictators may be prone to disastrous mistakes. China’s refusal to join the democracies in denouncing Russian aggression has also fueled more specific concerns about its own intentions and ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perceptions and possible parallels aside, in the past year Beijing has further intensified its ongoing campaign of pressure against Taipei, including an August 2022 military exercise of unprecedented scope in the water and airspace around the island. At the same time, the demonstrated effectiveness of precision munitions, information operations, and flexible small-unit tactics has bolstered the belief that, if the right preparations have been made in advance, even less numerous and seemingly weaker forces can hold off attacks by a heavily armed opponent. The conflict in Ukraine has thus led both to a heightened sense of threat and to renewed hope that, with sufficient effort, a war in the Indo-Pacific can be deterred and, if necessary, won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the need is now clear and widely acknowledged, the ability of the United States to lead its Asian allies in a major, sustained peacetime military buildup could still face significant fiscal constraints. Before the war broke out, some strategists were arguing that the United States should shift the great bulk of its military resources to Asia, leaving its prosperous European allies to finally take on full responsibility for their own defense. This now appears implausible. Barring a regime change in Moscow or the total collapse of Russian power, the U.S. Department of Defense will likely have to allocate more resources to the European theater than it had intended only a few years ago. Over the long term, this will require either a reduction in spending planned for Asia or a permanent increase in the overall size of the defense budget. With outlays still running well below Cold War levels as a share of GDP, the latter option is economically feasible, but it could prove politically difficult in the face of mounting congressional pressure for major cuts in federal spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-states-and-europe&quot;&gt;The United States and Europe&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to Asia, where security concerns were already growing, the war in Ukraine has had an especially dramatic impact on key countries in Europe and on the prospects for transatlantic defense cooperation. After decades of legal neutrality, Russian bellicosity and heightened concerns for their own security have forced both Sweden and Finland to come down from the fence and seek formal affiliation with other European democracies. The two Nordic nations have significant military and defense industrial capabilities, making them especially strong and capable allies. Their geographical location near key waterways and chokepoints and adjacent to Russian territory would strengthen NATO’s ability to defend itself and, if necessary, to conduct powerful counter-offensives against an invader from the east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to wage an effective proxy war against Russia, the United States and its European allies have been compelled to engage in unprecedented levels of consultation and policy coordination. While the United States is far and away the biggest contributor, other NATO members, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, and Canada have also agreed to transfer significant quantities of arms and ammunition to Ukraine, including artillery, anti-tank missiles, and air defense weapons. Beyond the current conflict, recent events have breathed new life into transatlantic planning mechanisms, resulting in what one NATO publication describes as “the biggest overhaul of Allied defence and deterrence since the Cold War.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shock of war has also induced many European countries to commit to major long-term increases in defense spending, potentially alleviating a perennial source of friction with the United States. According to one set of estimates, whereas NATO spending was on track to grow by 14 percent between 2021 and 2026, it is now likely to increase between 53 percent and 65 percent during the same period. One of the major contributors to this buildup will be Germany, which has long failed to meet the official NATO target of devoting 2 percent of its GDP to defense despite having Europe’s largest economy. In the immediate aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, German chancellor Olaf Scholz declared that the world had arrived at an historic turning point, or Zeitenwende. To meet the needs of this new age, Scholz pledged that Germany would finally fulfill its obligations, starting with an increase in defense spending of €100 billion, or roughly $106 billion at current exchange rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the end of the Cold War, some European governments have flirted with the idea of achieving true “strategic autonomy,” building up the European Union’s defenses and its capacity for independent action while reducing dependence on NATO and the United States. This idea seems now to have been abandoned or at least deferred into the indefinite future. In the face of imminent danger from Russia and perhaps, in the longer term, a growing threat from China, there is growing recognition that Europe cannot simply fend for itself but must continue to cleave closely to its American ally. In the words of a recent joint EU-NATO statement, the war in Ukraine demonstrates “more than ever” the “importance of the transatlantic bond.” Enhanced European capabilities are desirable, but their purpose must be to strengthen NATO, which, the EU-NATO statement emphasizes, “remains the foundation of collective defence for its allies and essential for Euro Atlantic security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with all of these signs of growing vigor and cohesion, there are some indications of possible contradictory developments. One year after declaring its intention to make an historic turn, the Scholz government has acknowledged that it will take several more years to reach the goal of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense. If Berlin lags behind, other European governments could revert to a similarly lax attitude about contributing more to the common defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proclamations of unity notwithstanding, the war has revealed significant differences in outlook among Europe’s democracies and, in particular, a division between several of the older, more established nations of the West and the newer members of the liberal order to the east. Bonn and Paris want to see Putin’s aggression fail, but they also hope that Russia can somehow be reengaged economically and that adroit diplomacy can bring it back into what Chancellor Scholz has described as the “peace order” that supposedly existed in the past. By contrast, former members of the old Soviet empire harbor deep and enduring suspicions about Moscow’s intentions and are determined to see it decisively defeated and isolated from the rest of the continent, at least for as long as Putin remains in power. The United States is clearly closer to “new Europe” in this regard, setting the stage for possible future disagreements with Germany and France. Thus, while they appear sturdy at the moment, transatlantic ties may yet be tested by the mounting costs of a protracted conflict or by renewed fears of nuclear escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, despite its recent role in leading opposition to Russian aggression and pressing for closer transatlantic cooperation, there is uncertainty about the permanence of the United States’ commitment to Europe. Some Republicans have sought to revive an “Asia First” strategy along the lines that the party favored in the early years of the Cold War. Alongside a desire to limit defense spending and a belief that China poses the greatest threat to U.S. security, there is an underlying suspicion and resentment of Europe in the minds of some Republicans. Especially in the party’s right wing, there is a belief that many Europeans are “woke,” environment-obsessed, anti-religious, left-leaning free riders whose values and interests have come to diverge significantly from those of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Trump era, some Republicans showed a surprising affinity for an authoritarian, illiberal Russian regime that was the obverse of their contempt for “soft” Western liberal democracies. This sentiment may fade as more familiar attitudes on the right reassert themselves. For now, there is a clear division between those who favor cutting aid to Ukraine and pulling back from Europe and those who support the dominant Cold War-era Republican position of backing fellow democracies against authoritarian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;europe-and-asia&quot;&gt;Europe and Asia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was true during the Cold War, the links between Europe and Asia remain the least developed leg of the democratic strategic triangle. This comes as no surprise. Even the most capable countries in both regions have limited capacity to project military power in sizable increments to the other side of the globe. Recent events have also driven home the fact that the greatest threat in each theater derives from the closer of the two authoritarian powers. Nevertheless, despite these enduring realities, there is a growing sense that the democracies of the Eurasian rimlands face a common danger emanating from the core of the heartland and that they must work together in order to meet it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the signs of this broadening of strategic horizons are significant despite being largely symbolic. In 2022, the NATO summit in Madrid was attended for the first time by observers from the United States’ most important Asian allies: Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, and Australia. With their visitors looking on, NATO members approved a new strategic concept that identified China explicitly as a “systemic challenge” and called for closer political consultation with like-minded Asian nations and “expanded cooperation” on a range of issues, including cyber threats and maritime security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the exception of India and Indonesia, the major democratic powers in Asia have joined in imposing punishing economic sanctions on Russia. Meanwhile, for their part, European officials have expressed growing concern about the threat China presents to freedom of navigation throughout the Indo-Pacific and, more specifically, to the security of Taiwan. Although there is not yet a formal policy regarding the possible imposition of European sanctions in response to Chinese aggression, some commentators have expressed the view that such a step would be appropriate and, indeed, inevitable. According to the newly appointed EU ambassador to Beijing: “In the event of a military invasion [of Taiwan] we have made it very clear that the EU, with the U.S. and its allies, will impose similar or even greater measures than those we have now taken against Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhat more concretely, a number of European and Asian states have recently entered into strategic cooperation agreements with varying configurations and covering everything from consultation and information exchanges to joint exercises and future technology development. Over the course of the past year, South Korea and the United Kingdom, Japan and France, Japan and Italy, and Japan and Germany have all pledged to tighten bilateral defense ties, while Japan, Italy, and the United Kingdom have agreed to work together to develop a next-generation fighter aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Asian democracies have proven that they are willing to provide diplomatic and economic support to their European partners, at least in circumstances where none of them has been directly attacked and where the costs and risks of imposing sanctions and embargos are relatively low. What remains less certain is the extent of Europe’s commitment to Asia under similar conditions. China obviously has far greater economic clout than Russia and could threaten to impose more severe punishment on any outsiders who dared to intercede in a confrontation between Beijing and Taiwan, for example. In such circumstances, Beijing would also seek to muddy the waters, blaming Taipei (and perhaps Washington) for initiating the crisis and trying to persuade key European countries to stand aloof from what Neville Chamberlain once memorably described as a distant quarrel “between people of whom we know nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-states-asia-and-europe&quot;&gt;The United States, Asia, and Europe&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside the realm of military cooperation, the democracies of Europe, Asia, and North America have begun to converge in their views of the values gap that separates them from Russia and China and, albeit tentatively, in their economic policies for dealing with those powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ allies have often been critical in the past of what they regard as its overly ideological, moralistic approach to foreign policy and its supposed proclivity for dividing the world simplistically into “good guys” and “bad guys.” In recent years, however, policymakers in both Europe and Asia have also begun to attribute the aggressive behavior of the authoritarian great powers to the repressive nature of their domestic regimes. Without necessarily calling them out by name, Asian leaders (including South Korea’s newly elected president) now frequently echo American rhetoric, warning that Russia and China together pose a threat to the universal values that unite democracies. Japan’s minister for trade and industry has likewise cautioned that “authoritarian countries have amassed tremendous power, both economically and militarily” and are using it to threaten “a world order based on fundamental values of freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.” A recent statement on EU-NATO cooperation identifies the two main culprits before stating bluntly that “authoritarian actors challenge our interests, values and democratic principles using multiple means — political, economic, technological and military.” In sum, democratic leaders now agree that they face rivals whose animosity and aggression are rooted in illiberal ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has driven home the dangers of economic dependence on potentially hostile regimes. After decades of debate, a new consensus has emerged among Europe’s democracies in favor of diversifying energy supplies away from Russia and drastically reducing imports of its oil and natural gas. The current crisis has also helped fuel doubts about the wisdom of relying on China for a wide range of manufactured goods, chemicals, and natural resources. This issue began to get greater attention during the Covid-19 pandemic, which highlighted the dependence of advanced democracies on Chinese manufacturers of personal protective equipment as well as the chemical precursors used in many medications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worsening relations and the growing danger of future trade disruptions have helped broaden the list of concerns to include everything from semiconductors to the rare-earth minerals used in magnets, batteries, and video displays. In response, the United States and some of its major trading partners have begun to boost subsidies for domestic producers of critical items and contemplate the potential virtues of “friend-shoring” — using tariffs to discourage imports of certain goods from China while encouraging them from countries that are friendly, close by, and preferably both. The process of building out networks of trusted suppliers is still in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as they reduce their dependence on critical imports from the authoritarian powers, the United States and some of its allies have begun to constrict those countries’ access to cutting-edge technologies that could boost their economies and empower their militaries. With Russia already largely isolated, China is the primary focus of these efforts. Over the last five years, the United States, Japan, and the European Union have all imposed new regulations which, to varying degrees, enhance the ability of government agencies to review and potentially block the purchase of domestic firms by foreign companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has taken the lead in imposing new export controls designed to prevent the sale of select, cutting-edge technologies, or the transfer of relevant knowledge, to China. In the recent case of high-end semiconductor manufacturing equipment, Washington has also exerted considerable diplomatic pressure to obtain compliance from allies with capabilities comparable to its own. Beyond individual cases, U.S. officials are working with European and Asian allies to craft common approaches to preserving remaining advantages over their authoritarian rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How far the United States and its allies will ultimately be willing to go in insulating themselves from China, and the extent to which they can harmonize their trade and technology policies toward it, remains to be determined, despite the European Union formally identifying China as a “systemic rival.” Germany, France, and the European Union as a whole have been reluctant to upend relations with a country that they still regard as an indispensable future trading partner. Some Europeans are also wary of what they regard as a self-interested, nationalistic turn in U.S. economic policy, and they fear that, if they follow too closely in Washington’s footsteps, they could be drawn into an avoidable conflict with China. To forestall, or at least to slow such coordination, Beijing has targeted a new “charm offensive” on Europe, which it sees as the weakest link in a tightening democratic chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-struggle-for-the-global-south&quot;&gt;The Struggle for the Global South&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as it solidifies opposing liberal and authoritarian blocs in the Northern Hemisphere, the war in Ukraine has ushered in a new era of intensifying competition between them for influence in the Global South. As in other domains, the United States and China will drive this aspect of the democratic-authoritarian rivalry, with the advanced democracies of Europe and Asia, on the one hand, and Russia, on the other, playing supporting roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Cold War, Russia was actively engaged in the developing world, where it worked to spread communism and outflank the West by backing left-wing governments, cultivating allies, and acquiring military outposts. All of this eventually came to naught with the final demise of the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia’s new leaders had no interest in promoting an ideology in which they themselves no longer believed, and they lacked the means to provide economic assistance to countries whose impoverishment in some cases only marginally exceeded their own. Arms sales became the primary tool for exerting influence, especially in dealing with countries whose militaries continued to rely on Russian-made equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As relations with the West have worsened over the last two decades, Moscow has intensified and diversified its engagement, including through the provision of mercenaries to train local forces and enhance regime security. Starting in 2015, Russia once again became directly involved in the Middle East, sending forces to help prop up the Syrian government. Following Beijing’s lead, Moscow also began to use propaganda and disinformation to attack Western arrogance and interventionism and associate itself more closely with the outlook and interests of the world’s poorest countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Moscow’s heavy reliance on arms sales and security assistance, the war in Ukraine will likely constrict its ability to exert influence in the developing world. The drawdown of its own stockpiles, the strains on its defense industrial base, and the poor performance of some of its weapon systems will make it more difficult for Russia to hold its place as an arms supplier. Massive casualties could also mean that fewer men will be available to serve as mercenaries and trainers or be involved in overseas military adventures. Russia will remain a major arms seller, but its incompetence, its failures on the battlefield, and its sheer brutality will diminish its reputation for martial skill and its desirability as a role model for aspiring regional powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is true for Russia, China’s interest in the Global South has fluctuated with the passage of time. Throughout the 1950s and into the early 1970s, Mao regarded what he labeled the “third world” as central to his dreams of leading a global revolution and his hopes of pushing back against Western, and later Soviet, “imperialism.” With Mao’s death and the start of “reform and opening up” under Deng Xiaoping, Beijing lost interest in promoting the spread of communism and focused instead on building strong trading ties with advanced industrial nations. In the 1990s and early 2000s, as their economy boomed, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) planners began once again to pay more attention to the developing world, this time viewing it primarily in economic terms as a source of raw materials, another market for inexpensive manufactured products, and a potential destination for China’s growing supply of investment capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, Chinese strategists have come to take a much broader view of the potential importance of the Global South. Indeed, to an extent that has not been fully appreciated, they now see it as central to their plans for pushing back against U.S. and Western hegemony and catapulting their own country into a position of global leadership. This assessment reflects a mix of economic, diplomatic, ideological, and military considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As most of the advanced industrial democracies experience population decline and slower economic growth, and as China’s relations with them worsen, Beijing will need to find new outlets for the products of its vast manufacturing base. The countries of the Global South are still far too poor to take the place of the less populous but far richer nations of the Global North. Nevertheless, with their expanding populations and rising incomes, Africa and South Asia could someday become important new sources of demand for China’s exports and drivers of its continuing economic vitality. This is evidently part of what Xi Jinping has in mind when he declares that China must move toward a “dual circulation” growth model, one that relies less on exports to the advanced industrial nations and more on domestic demand and the markets of the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preferred access to fast-expanding pools of demand for products such as cell phones and IT network switching equipment can also help Chinese companies achieve economies of scale, enabling them to undercut their Western competitors and putting them in position to dominate global markets and set industrial standards that will lock in their advantages. A dwindling working-age population is already causing wages to rise and eroding China’s long-standing advantages as a low-cost manufacturing hub. One way of dealing with this could be for Chinese companies to build new productive capacity in poorer, populous countries. As they look to the next stage in their own development, CCP planners evidently hope that the nations of the Global South will play the same role for them as China once did for the advanced industrial West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economics aside, Beijing clearly sees the developing world as a source of backing in its diplomatic disputes and escalating “discursive struggle” with the West. For example, when faced with recent criticism for mistreating its Uyghur Muslim minority, the CCP regime quickly obtained countervailing statements of support from a collection of developing nations. Beijing has also taken advantage of the fact that, for the most part, the United Nations operates on the principle of one nation, one vote. In recent years, it has used financial inducements to line up backing from poorer countries for its preferred candidates for jobs in various international agencies and its own distinctive interpretation of concepts such as human rights and internet freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas they once focused almost exclusively on their immediate neighborhood and, in particular, on the waters off their eastern seaboard, China’s planners now see virtually the entire Global South as a domain of strategic rivalry with the West and as a potential theater for future military operations. Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is clearly motivated in part by the desire to build more secure transport links between China and its suppliers of energy, food, and raw materials. Shipments by road and rail along the BRI’s overland axes cannot compete on price with maritime bulk transport, but in the event of a major conflict, they could help minimize the effects of a naval blockade and permit sufficient imports to keep China’s war economy running. New ports, canals, and pipelines in South and Southeast Asia could enable China’s maritime fleet to bypass key chokepoints, reducing its vulnerability to interdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having abandoned its previous objections to overseas bases, Beijing now appears intent on building a network of facilities that could extend from the Horn of Africa south and east around the rim of the Indian Ocean, west and north along the Atlantic coast of Africa, and perhaps across the Atlantic into the Western Hemisphere. Attacks launched from some of these locations could close vital waterways such as the Suez or Panama Canals at the outset of a future war, slowing the movement of U.S. forces from its east coast to the Indo-Pacific theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has thus far been careful not to trigger Washington’s historically rooted reflexes by venturing too far into what the Americans still regard as their own backyard. Despite this lingering caution, China could take the further step of raising the profile of its involvement in the Western Hemisphere as the Sino-American rivalry intensifies, perhaps gaining access to ports and airfields within range of the California coastline, the Caribbean, and the Panama Canal. By pressing in closer to its most powerful rival, Beijing may hope to flip the field, forcing the United States to pull back from the Indo-Pacific and compelling it to focus more on defending its own “near abroad” rather than on trying to contain China. Harkening back to one of Mao’s favorite stratagems, Xi and his underlings may hope that they too can “surround the city from the countryside,” using positions of strength in the less-developed world to escape encirclement and launch a campaign of counter-encirclement against their richer and still more capable opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past 75 years, the intensity of the United States’ engagement with most parts of the developing world has fluctuated depending on the perceived presence of an urgent geopolitical or ideological threat. For the first three decades of the Cold War, the United States devoted increasing resources to stemming communist subversion in Latin America and across the newly liberated former colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia. U.S. interest and involvement peaked during the Vietnam War, dwindled with the collapse of the Soviet Union, then grew again after 9/11 and the onset of the so-called global war on terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is now in the early days of a new cycle of strategically motivated engagement in the Global South. Despite a strong desire among both Republicans and Democrats to pull back from quagmires and “forever wars,” U.S. policymakers find themselves forced to wrestle with the question of how best to counter growing Chinese and, to a lesser extent, Russian presence and influence in parts of the developing world. The urgency and complexity of this task have been highlighted by the reluctance of many poorer countries to join the advanced industrial democracies in denouncing Russia’s aggression, or criticizing Beijing’s tacit support for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some observers have interpreted these developments as heralding the emergence of a new nonaligned movement, along the lines that many advocated during the Cold War. There is, however, very little reason to think that a cohesive, powerful southern bloc is any more plausible today than it was 50 years ago. The nations of the Global South do not share a common ideology, and they have a wide variety of domestic institutions and enjoy disparate levels of political freedom and economic development. Some lean toward democratic Western powers, others toward authoritarian Eastern ones. And while many poorer countries may hope to play one side against the other in order to extract benefits for themselves from both, they show no signs of pursuing a coherent, collective strategy designed to benefit them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For much of the past two decades China was able to steal a march on its rivals, taking advantage of their preoccupation with other problems to enhance its presence and extend its influence across wide swaths of the developing world. Starting with the announcement of the BRI in 2013, U.S. and allied observers began to pay more attention to China’s economic, diplomatic, and military activities in the developing world, but they were slow to develop a clear view of how these disparate pieces fit together or what their larger purpose might be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While differences remain, there is increasing recognition among advanced democracies that Beijing’s actions are neither benign nor purely commercial in intent and that they must be countered and offset. Separately and together, the United States and its allies have initiated programs to provide transparent, low-cost alternatives to Chinese funding to developing countries seeking to upgrade their transportation, communication, and power-generating infrastructure. Beyond these specific sectors, the U.S. government is in the process of revamping its entire approach to development assistance so that it can compete more effectively against China. At the United Nations, Washington has also taken a particular interest in countering CCP influence operations in key developing countries and across entire regions, especially Africa. Meanwhile, the Department of Defense and the U.S. intelligence community are watching closely for signs that Beijing is trying to acquire more overseas bases and considering ways to block and, if necessary, respond to such developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as the United States and its allies are beginning to focus more of their attention on China’s activities in the developing world, recent events have elevated its importance to Beijing. The downward spiral in relations with the United States and the wider West seems, if anything, to be sharpening Beijing’s southward focus, encouraging it to launch new and as yet ill-defined global security and development initiatives. The prospect of stricter limitations on China’s access to the markets of advanced industrial democracies has added urgency to the search for alternative outlets for exports and investment. The increasingly open “systemic rivalry” with the West has encouraged Beijing to become more vocal and explicit in proclaiming that it has a superior alternative to liberal democracy. And the growing plausibility of a future military conflict seems certain to accelerate China’s efforts to acquire overseas bases and access agreements. All of this, in turn, will heighten the anxieties and spur the counter-reactions of democracies. The contest for influence in the Global South has now been fully joined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment offered here has three broad implications for U.S. strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, at least for the moment, there is virtually no chance of driving a wedge between Moscow and Beijing. When this possibility was discussed a few years ago, the question was what, if anything, democracies could offer Russia that might help to peel it away from China. Today, the question has been reversed, but the answer is still the same. The authoritarian powers are joined at the hip, and there is no inducement that democracies might conceivably be willing to extend at this point that would have any chance of splitting them apart. Pursuing this illusory goal would be a waste of time at best, and if it resulted in concessions that strengthened China’s hand, it could actually be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies would be better advised to take the opposite tack, highlighting Beijing’s complicity in Moscow’s barbarism, emphasizing the commonalities in worldview and interests that bind the two authoritarian powers, and making clear the threat that they pose to the liberal democracies and to any smaller and weaker states, regardless of regime type, that happen to run afoul of them. The democracies must also continue to monitor closely the evolving channels through which Beijing may seek to provide aid and comfort to Moscow. And they must be prepared to impose substantial, escalating costs if China begins to do more than it is already doing to keep Russia afloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, with respect to its major allies in Europe and Asia, the object of U.S. strategy must be to draw these countries together as closely as possible so that they begin to resemble a true, global “free world” alliance. In addition to intelligence sharing, joint military planning, and close diplomatic coordination, the democracies should engage in advanced consultation and serious, detailed preparation for the imposition of harsh collective sanctions on potential aggressors. The threat of sanctions is insufficient in itself to deter a determined predatory state. Still, had Vladimir Putin known in advance the full extent of the economic punishment that would be inflicted on his country, there is at least a chance that he could have been dissuaded from invading Ukraine. As Xi Jinping contemplates the possibility of moving against Taiwan, he should have little doubt about the sweeping trade, travel, and financial restrictions democracies will impose in response, even at substantial cost to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the longer run, the United States and its key partners in Europe and Asia should work together to create a more integrated economic subsystem similar in some respects to the one they constructed during the Cold War. The core of such a bloc would be comprised of a group of like-minded advanced industrial countries willing to lower barriers to flows of goods, capital, information, and people among themselves while imposing some restrictions on their economic interaction with the authoritarian powers, and especially with China. These countries should seek to maintain their existing advantages by slowing or blocking the transfer of cutting-edge technologies while expanding scientific, technical, and industrial collaboration among themselves. The members of this grouping should also limit the danger of espionage or sabotage by collectively prohibiting the use of Chinese-made equipment in critical infrastructure. The advanced democracies must also take steps to reduce their vulnerability to threatened or actual disruptions in supplies of critical materials and manufactured goods by increasing domestic productive capacity and building out networks comprised of trusted, like-minded countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate objective of these measures would not be total decoupling but rather partial disengagement — a greater degree of separation and insulation from authoritarian powers that continue to take advantage of democracies’ openness but whose interests and values are inimical to their own. The United States and some of the other advanced industrial nations have already begun to take steps in this direction in recent years. To date, however, their activities have been only loosely coordinated, leaving many loopholes and potential work-arounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the democracies need to develop a coherent, collective approach to dealing with the Global South, including (but not limited to) a strategy for countering Russian and Chinese influence there. Having sometimes paid insufficient attention in the past, there is a danger that Washington, in particular, will now be prone to overreact. If it responds reflexively, especially to Beijing’s increasingly widespread and diverse activities, it could wind up wasting resources in places that are actually of little interest or value to it. It is also possible that some of what China is now doing in the developing world will turn out in the long run to be wasteful and perhaps even counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing appears to be betting that it can succeed where the West has often failed, stimulating growth and guiding political development in ways that will serve its own economic and strategic ends. Yet the obstacles that have held developing countries back in the past, including corruption, weak institutions, crippling debt, and political instability, seem certain to persist in many places. Indeed, all of these problems are likely to be made even worse by extensive Chinese intrusion into local societies and economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part for these reasons, Beijing’s activities have begun to stir resentment in portions of Africa, Central and South Asia, and the South Pacific. In countries that have achieved at least a degree of political liberalization, advanced democracies can help to fuel the forces of resistance and slow the spread of China’s corrosive influence by supporting civil society groups that favor a free press, fair elections, an independent judiciary, and scrupulous oversight of government contracting. More generally, and in spite of their own past track records, the democracies need to make the case that it is China, rather than themselves, that has taken on the role of a neo-imperialist power. Notwithstanding its ceaseless rhetoric about “win-win cooperation” and building a “community of common destiny,” it is Beijing that seeks to penetrate and gain leverage over smaller and weaker countries, establishing relationships of dependence and exploiting them for its own benefit. The democracies can offset some of China’s appeal by providing more capital for sound investments that benefit entire societies rather than select elites and by opening their own educational systems and markets more widely to people and goods from the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its partners need to set priorities and, to the extent possible, divide the labor among themselves. Even as the United States takes a global perspective, others will focus their energies on countries and regions where they have special experience, access, and influence, such as Britain and France in parts of Africa, for example, or Japan and South Korea in Central Asia. As for priorities, rather than attempting to promote the further spread of democracy, Western powers should concentrate on helping to bolster democratic practices and institutions where these have already begun to take root. Beyond this, the United States and its allies need to focus on countering Chinese influence in countries that contain large reserves of critical resources and that sit adjacent to major maritime chokepoints. Regardless of regime type, states such as India, the Philippines, or Vietnam, which for their own reasons are willing to contribute to balancing Beijing’s power, are also worthy of at least some forms of support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to meeting potential threats, the democracies should be alert to opportunities to make China pay a price for its ambitions. Exposing the corruption and brutality of some of those Beijing is backing could help to damage its reputation and curtail its influence in the developing world and beyond. Supporting forces that seek to resist China and its local clients could draw Beijing into costly internal conflicts that are difficult to win. CCP strategists seem to believe that they can have the benefits of deep engagement in the developing world while avoiding quagmires and overextension. Like the United States and the Soviet Union, Beijing may soon find that its reach has exceeded its grasp.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 1991, Ukraine inherited a science, technology, and innovation (ST&amp;amp;I) ecosystem that mainly supported the Soviet Union’s military industrial complex, space exploration, and propaganda machine.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; The system has deeply rooted challenges such as inefficiencies, underfunding, and opacity in processes. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought a new host of additional challenges including displacement of students and educators, damage and destruction of educational facilities, and power outages affecting online learning options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To realize its full potential and become an engine of innovation and economic growth, this ecosystem needs to be reformed,&lt;/strong&gt; including on issues such as its financing, quality assurance, and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the short run, the biggest challenge is to ensure support for Ukrainian researchers, scientists, educators, administrators, and students and keep key institutions afloat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the medium to long run, deeper reforms are needed for this ecosystem to become a world-class center of R&amp;amp;D and innovation.&lt;/strong&gt; Stakeholders must come together and realize a modern vision for the sector, one that looks to the West and is anchored in EU integration. This includes taking significant steps to improve the financial autonomy of higher education institutions, foster the commercialization of R&amp;amp;D, introduce an independent quality assurance system, improve integrity and combat corruption within institutions, rebalance academic disciplines, and promote cross-cultural exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education and research and development (R&amp;amp;D) are critical drivers of economic growth and innovation. Although Ukraine has strong levels of human capital and numerous higher education institutions, the country’s science, technology, and innovation (ST&amp;amp;I) ecosystem faces challenges predating the current war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Ukraine declared its independence in 1991, it inherited an ST&amp;amp;I ecosystem including higher education institutions that mainly supported the Soviet Union’s military industrial complex, space exploration, and propaganda machine. In the years following Ukraine’s independence, this ecosystem has been largely undervalued and in need of reform to achieve its full potential. The way the sector is financed, the quantity versus quality of institutions, skills mismatches present in the labor market, and the decreasing youth population have negatively affected the sector’s potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020 Ukraine spent 5.4 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on education, one of the highest percentages among EU countries. However, the education system is inefficient, lacks transparency, and does not prepare students for the demands of the workforce. In addition, Russia’s ongoing war has heavily damaged Ukraine’s ST&amp;amp;I infrastructure, including universities, scientific institutions, and research centers, and has prompted nearly a quarter of Ukraine’s scientific workforce to emigrate. This ecosystem must be rebuilt, but more importantly, it must play a significant role in transforming Ukraine into a modern nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of international agencies and think tanks outlined the importance of supporting the ST&amp;amp;I of Ukraine as an engine of economic growth and future innovation. Their overall assessment of Ukraine’s ST&amp;amp;I system is that the sector has been deprioritized and underfunded and that it is shrinking and in need of deep reform. Drawing on this research and expert interviews, this brief describes the main challenges of Ukraine’s ST&amp;amp;I ecosystem and presents recommendations to strengthen the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-in-ukraines-sti-ecosystem&quot;&gt;Challenges in Ukraine’s ST&amp;amp;I Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s ST&amp;amp;I ecosystem is complex and requires a cross-sectoral understanding of its structures, players, and politics. As in most countries, the ST&amp;amp;I ecosystem of Ukraine consists of diverse players, including the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NASU), higher education institutions (including private and public universities), technoparks, R&amp;amp;D institutions, and private companies. A legacy of the Soviet era, the system has an inward orientation: the state funded it mainly to support the military industrial complex, so it is not designed to compete internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A distinct characteristic of the Ukrainian system is that it separates R&amp;amp;D institutions from universities, both in funding and structure. Most R&amp;amp;D funding the state provides is allocated to the NASU, but the NASU’s budget and decisions are under the jurisdiction of Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament). Aside from collaboration with Kyiv Academic University and other relationship-based partnerships with universities, NASU R&amp;amp;D opportunities are not embedded in Ukraine’s higher education institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, public universities receive a very small fraction of R&amp;amp;D funding and have little autonomy in pursuing other funding sources. The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, under the Cabinet of Ministers, governs universities and associated institutions, with the Finance Ministry having final say in resource allocation and on numerous occasions blocking important measures such as tax incentives for the technoparks. While Ukrainian universities have academic autonomy, lack of financial autonomy inhibits their ability to make important decisions. The Ministry of Education and Science remains deeply involved in the management of these institutions. Absence of financial autonomy prevents higher education institutions from using their reputational capital, resulting in complete dependence on government funding. But government funding alone is insufficient for academic institutions to pursue research activities. As such, these structural challenges of the Soviet legacy serve as significant barriers to modernizing the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Revolution of Dignity in 2013–14 and Russia’s invasion in 2014 added an enormous boost to the country’s democratization and development efforts, and a number of reforms in the ST&amp;amp;I ecosystem have been proposed. First, in 2005, Ukraine sought to transform its education system into the Bologna Process, an EU standard, to ensure Ukrainian universities are competitive on the world stage. The process consisted of formal alignment of regulations with European standards and integration with European institutions, and discussions on higher education reform aimed at a more Western approach. However, the Ukrainian government made only a few attempts to change its post-Soviet practices, concentrating its efforts on nonessential bureaucratic and formal tasks. Following through on the objectives of this reform is critical for maintaining a healthy pipeline of international students as well as Ukrainian students who face opportunities to pursue education elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second reform is the law on higher education adopted by the Verkhovna Rada in September 2014. This important law highlights the critical role of institutional autonomy for higher education institutions on both the financial and programmatic sides by codifying the basis for a reformed and well-functioning system of higher education. The law also recognizes the need for these institutions to create environments in which competitive human capital can be shaped to meet the needs of the current labor market, as well as spur innovation and economic growth. However, the law still lacks full implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third important reform, a 2016 law on scientific and scientific-technical activity, would add two new independent bodies: (a) the National Council of Ukraine on the Development of Science and Technology as a decisionmaking body for all key stakeholders in the Ukraine ST&amp;amp;I ecosystem and (b) the National Research Foundation of Ukraine, an independent institution to support R&amp;amp;D of independent academics. This reform is still being implemented and changes the governance of ST&amp;amp;I such that universities are placed under the same jurisdiction as the NASU, improving the integration of the NASU in the overall ecosystem while making universities more autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, Ukraine has been transforming its intellectual property (IP) system. In 2016, the State Intellectual Property Service was abolished, and its functions were moved to the Ministry for Development of Economy and Trade. On September 29, 2017, the High Court on Intellectual Property of Ukraine was established. Since 2018, this special IP committee has advised the Cabinet of Ministers on policies and coordination of actions of the executive branch in this area. Most importantly, the legal system underwent fundamental changes. Up until 2017, intellectual property was not separate from family, civil, housing, land, or labor law and was under the local level of regional municipalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the international community has supported Ukraine in reforming and modernizing the country’s ST&amp;amp;I system. One significant initiative is a five-year World Bank project worth $200 million, launched in May 2021. Besides being consistent with the aforementioned reforms, its overall objective is to make the higher education system more efficient and increase transparency and cooperation between different institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought a new host of additional challenges including displacement of students and educators, damage and destruction of educational facilities, and power outages affecting online learning options. Due to the ongoing war with Russia, many university budgets have been slashed by at least two-thirds. Out of the 749 tertiary institutions surveyed by the World Bank, 21 percent had lost over $115 million due to the war, as of October 25, 2022. In addition to the significant financial constraints from students and the government, 91 percent of institutions reported that up to 30 percent of their students had to be evacuated abroad, while 63 percent stated almost 30 percent of their students were internally displaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people make Ukraine. Thus, in the short run, the biggest challenge is to ensure support for Ukrainian researchers, scientists, educators, administrators, and students and keep key institutions afloat. In the medium to long run, deeper reforms are needed for this ecosystem to become a world-class center of R&amp;amp;D and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;immediate-needs-keeping-quality-institutions-afloat&quot;&gt;Immediate Needs: Keeping Quality Institutions Afloat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way the international community can assist Ukraine’s education administration is through financial aid. From February to August 2022, the United States provided $8.5 billion in direct budgetary support to the Ukrainian government to ensure core institutions like hospitals and schools stay afloat. In addition, the European Union approved an €18 billion assistance package to Ukraine that includes supporting the continual operations of Ukrainian schools. Additionally, countries like Germany have donated €10 million to Education Cannot Wait programs in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of financial support, the Ukrainian education sector desperately needs to prevent brain drain. In addition to the university-aged students who have fled abroad, thousands of academics and over 22,000 teachers have left Ukraine in search of refuge. To reduce the effects of Ukraine’s brain drain, outside higher education institutions could partner with Ukrainian universities on research projects and consultancies. For example, Erasmus+, an EU study-and-work-away program, has supported numerous projects in Ukraine and hopes to bring foreign academics and students to Kyiv in 2023. Alongside Erasmus+, the National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy has provided opportunities for Ukrainian students by opening local offices at the University of Toronto, Justus Liebig University, Vilnius University, and the University of Glasgow. These offices will allow students from these universities the chance to conduct joint research in Ukraine and create joint educational programs and training courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to preventing brain drain and providing financial aid, the international community can assist Ukraine’s higher education institutions by establishing nonresidential fellowships for Ukrainian professors and researchers. For the sponsoring institution, these fellowships are more economical, are easier to administer, and provide significant help for faculty members who do not have the financial means to continue their work in Ukraine. For example, Indiana University Bloomington recently announced it will send $5,000 to up to 20 humanities and social sciences scholars who are either in or from Ukraine for one year through its new IU-Ukraine Nonresidential Scholars Program. To foster collaboration between faculty members and administrators at Ukrainian Catholic University, the University of Notre Dame has offered research grants for academics in Ukraine and two Ukrainian fellows on campus (see Box 1 for other initiatives).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-1-kyiv-school-of-economics-kse-initiatives&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1. Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) Initiatives&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The KSE has invested in partnerships with academic institutions across the globe, launching Ukrainian Global University, a project to invest in Ukraine’s human capital, incubate Ukrainian talent, and ultimately rebuild Ukraine. This project partners scholars with universities throughout the global community. Additionally, the KSE’s charitable foundation has raised over $40 million to fund a range of humanitarian aid initiatives, including talent incubation, bomb shelters in schools, innovation programs during the war, and scholarships for veterans and internally displaced people (IDPs).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;At the University of Toronto, Peter Loewen, director of the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, announced the university’s commitment to fully support 30 students from the KSE to study in the master of global affairs and master of public policy programs. The Canadian government is financing the initiative to demonstrate strong support for Ukraine. The University of Toronto will cover the tuition of selected students, who are also eligible for financial support from Mitacs, a Canadian nonprofit organization, to cover their living expenses. The program is a joint initiative between the KSE and the Munk School, and students will receive diplomas from both institutions.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In addition, George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs supports 20 Ukrainian scientists through its Institute for European, Russian, and Eurasian Studies (IERES) via funding for displaced Ukrainian scholars. This program is intended to support Ukrainian scientists in both political science and international relations. The KSE selected and appointed 12 nonresidential fellows. University of Massachusetts Amherst also delegated $750,000 toward establishing a multilevel partnership with the KSE that allows students to study at University of Massachusetts for up to a year with little to no cost.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In an effort to extend and expand on a 20-year partnership, the University of Houston launched a dual-degree program with the KSE. The program specifically targets brain drain, encouraging Ukrainian students to study in Ukraine but simultaneously earn an international-level diploma. It also helps alumni infiltrate better job markets and international PhD programs in the face of developing an economy during and after wartime.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crafting-a-long-term-vision-for-the-sector&quot;&gt;Crafting a Long-Term Vision for the Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the medium to long run, Ukraine’s education and innovation ecosystem should steer away from its Soviet past. Stakeholders must come together and realize a modern vision for the sector, one that looks to the West and is anchored in EU integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the postwar reconstruction of Europe and South Korea relied heavily on building the nations’ overall ST&amp;amp;I capacity. Similarly, the key to a strong and prosperous Ukraine is a modern ST&amp;amp;I ecosystem, and the Ukrainian government must elevate innovation to the center of the reconstruction strategy. In this regard, supporting implementation of key ST&amp;amp;I reforms is critical in laying the path for a unified vision for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;improve-the-financial-autonomy-of-higher-education-institutions-and-foster-commercialization-of-rd&quot;&gt;Improve the financial autonomy of higher education institutions and foster commercialization of R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s outdated incentive structure puts significant pressure on professors to publish. As with efforts underway in the United States and Europe, publishing should be balanced with other outputs, including involving professors in entrepreneurial efforts to commercialize discoveries as well as mentoring the next generation of researchers and students. Research experiences are an opportunity for students (graduate and undergraduate) to apply their knowledge while still in school. There are many positive outcomes associated with this research expertise: students gain hands-on experience and build social networks that make them more attractive to the labor market and contribute to students’ overall career satisfaction. For example, the United States invests heavily in research experiences for undergraduates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Universities and higher education institutions should alter their structure of incentives to provide each institution with more financial autonomy and responsibility. These changes can include prioritizing funding to schools based on performance, rather than on student population, and allowing universities more freedom when it comes to fundraising. As the Ukrainian higher education sector moves forward, its primary goal should be to provide state and municipal higher education institutions with financial and organizational autonomy. This autonomy should include the authority to manage and implement funds without ministerial approval and to become full owners of their property. In addition to autonomy, the government should ensure all higher education institutions have equal and competitive access to different types of funding. As part of these efforts, the law on higher education of 2014 should be implemented and operationalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduce-an-independent-quality-assurance-system&quot;&gt;Introduce an independent quality assurance system.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian higher education institutions lack a quality assurance system. A successful quality assurance system will require transparency and supportive communication to build and maintain trust. Currently, information on universities and NASU performance is very limited. Such assessments are expensive as they require gathering basic facts, and each discipline will require a unique assessment mechanism. Since 2019, Ukraine has fully implemented the European higher education quality assurance system based on the 2015 Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area (ESG). All Ukrainian universities already have an internal quality assurance system. However, the tools borrowed from the European Higher Education Area are not effective given the lack of self-governance and autonomy in higher education institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, as Ukraine begins its reconstruction efforts, it should focus on creating a more comprehensive and holistic educational system where each stage of education complements the others through knowledge acquisition. For example, by implementing education standards and key performance indicators (KPIs), institutions can monitor and evaluate their teaching and research productivity within the classroom and assess the areas needing improvement. Education standards and KPIs also will foster a more transparent and fair system, as institutions that meet the standards will be rewarded, while those that fail will receive penalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further quality assurance, the Ukrainian education system should change its expected learning outcomes to match the standards of high-achieving OECD countries and provide professional development training and opportunities to professors and teachers as well as financial incentives to keep faculty members at home. ST&amp;amp;I professionals, scholars, and practitioners need to support ongoing efforts to build a more transparent system to assess the quality of higher education institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Ukrainian educational sector should prioritize working in tandem with the European University Association’s new Ukrainian task force as it begins the reconstruction process. The goal of this new task force is to provide guidance, sector-specific strategic support, recommendations, and long-term development in Ukraine’s higher education system both during and after the war. Specifically, topics will include system restructuring, governance and leadership, quality assurance, and more. The program is expected to last for two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;improve-integrity-and-combat-corruption-within-the-sti-ecosystem&quot;&gt;Improve integrity and combat corruption within the ST&amp;amp;I ecosystem.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite attempts to reform the system, the Soviet culture of corruption, including bribes and gifts, is still very much alive in Ukrainian higher education institutions. World Bank estimates point out that close to 25–30 percent of students have directly engaged in academic misconduct or bribery. To gain university access or other advantages, students may resort to illegal practices such as bribery, fraud, misrepresentation, cheating, and exploiting personal connections. Students may also engage in corrupt practices to gain access to dormitory spaces and prestigious disciplines like medicine or law or claim special status (e.g., orphan or other status). These integrity violations are enabled by a decentralized admissions process that lacks transparency and a clear policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to an OECD study, Kyiv-Mohyla Academy is the only public higher education institution mostly free of corruption and one of the few higher education institutions in Ukraine whose degrees are recognized outside the country. The university is modeled after North American universities, engaging in partnerships abroad and adopting international standards. Some deterrents to corruption include a tradition of international exposure and partnerships, academic staff who identify with the institution and its historic mission, and preselection of outstanding students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific actions are being taken to reduce corruption, such as introducing a standardized test for school leavers (undergraduates) evaluated by an independent body and admission tests for master’s candidates. Since 2014, there has been a rise in investigations of plagiarism conducted by governmental officials, especially those involved in decisionmaking concerning ST&amp;amp;I. However, most of that effort has been based on volunteers. Providing systematic support for these efforts would help to accelerate the pace of cultural change in the education sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rebalance-academic-disciplines&quot;&gt;Rebalance academic disciplines.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Soviet times, STEM was prioritized in academia and research. As a result, STEM fields account for close to 90 percent of total research output. Moreover, although disciplines such as the social sciences, economics, and humanities have higher student enrollment than STEM fields, they produce less than 5 percent of research output (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xqIabYN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. Number of Students in Ukrainian Higher Education Institutions by Discipline, 1989 versus 2017.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/55f9390c-9c8b-555e-9a2f-d200039eec2a/content&quot;&gt;World Bank, Review of the Education Sector in Ukraine: Moving toward Effectiveness, Equity, and Efficiency (Washington, DC: World Bank, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although STEM fields are essential, so are disciplines such as the humanities, political science, and social sciences for a number of reasons. These disciplines promote democratization and facilitate a multidisciplinary culture essential for innovation. As in Western nations, men dominate Ukraine’s more scientific and technology-based majors, while more humanitarian majors have a higher percentage of women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for social disciplines is particularly important in the disinformation space and preservation of Ukrainian heritage and contemporary art that has been critical in fighting the “soft power” of the Russian propaganda machine. Disciplines such as history, communication, and psychology will be important in Ukraine’s ability to successfully fight Russian propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other disciplines will also play an important role for the future of Ukraine. The medical profession in Ukraine has attracted international students due to the low tuition fees, highly ranked medical programs, and energetic marketing tactics. Physical therapy, rehabilitation, and mental health not only are critical in meeting enormous demand from the Ukrainian population but also represent areas of growth and innovation in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;promote-cross-cultural-exchanges&quot;&gt;Promote cross-cultural exchanges.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian ST&amp;amp;I ecosystem needs a value system that is more aligned with Western traditions. One way to ensure this transition is for Ukraine to continue, as well as expand on, its collaboration and cooperation with international institutions and universities. In addition to receiving support for Ukrainians at home, Ukraine should further its educational revival by increasing its educational exchanges with the Erasmus+ program and other European universities. In addition, to increase Ukraine’s cooperation with EU and Western institutions, the rate of English language proficiency needs to be much higher in all disciplines. Ukraine will need to invest more resources in learning new languages, with a focus on English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Ukrainian educational sector should prioritize working in tandem with the European University Association’s new Ukrainian task force as it begins its reconstruction process. The goal of this new task force is to provide guidance, sector-specific strategic support, recommendations, and long-term development in Ukraine’s higher education system both during and after the war. Topics include system restructuring, governance and leadership, quality assurance, and more. The program is expected to last for two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only universities with successful alumni and strong programs will survive in today’s Ukraine. In the short run, the international community should support quality institutions that can withstand the stress of the war. Political forces that have been in power in Ukraine since 1991 have dismissed the importance of education and research for the country’s future. Funding higher education institutions should be regarded not as an expense but as an investment in the future of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the war has ripped Ukraine’s social fabric, revealing an unprecedented desire to distance Ukraine from its Soviet past. This distancing is especially important for science, technology, and higher education institutions. Ukraine has an opportunity to break from the past and transform the education ecosystem into an engine of economic growth and scientific discovery for Ukraine and the world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;戴耀廷稱毋須簽協議後向參與者致歉 趙家賢指本土與傳統泛民互信極不足&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;趙家賢指戴耀廷初選後清楚知道「踩到界」、「攬炒十步」如「世界大核爆」感心寒&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（4日）踏入審訊第38天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢今繼續作供，同意游說戴耀廷毋須參選人簽協議，是為免初選勝出者被DQ並危害「35+計劃」。而戴耀廷在初選記者會公布毋須簽協議後，曾向參與者發訊息致歉，稱不用簽協議是他「個人決定」，「我不想由我的手去製造藉口給政府去DQ任何人」。趙家賢指當時本土抗爭派對此有「超級大意見」，形容他們與傳統民主派「好明顯個互信度係極之不足」。惟趙同意，即使沒有簽署協議，戴耀廷和區諾軒仍可為會上達成的共識做證。他亦同意，鄒家成等人事後發布的「墨落無悔」聲明書與新西協議的字眼和意思大致相同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱戴耀廷69記者會前已向參與者發出共同綱領最終版本&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱戴耀廷6.9記者會前已向參與者發出「共同綱領」最終版本&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方昨展示2020年6月8日，戴耀廷向組織者群組發出的各區協調文件「final」版本。被問是否知道戴曾發給其他與會者，趙表示當時戴曾向他表示，已與各區參與協調和有意參選的團隊接觸，並向相關人士發送各區「共同綱領」最後版本。趙亦重申他和區諾軒建議戴勿要求參選人簽署協議，「戴耀廷係當時仲做緊最後考慮」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意不要求簽協議是不望留下文件被dq危害35稱與區諾軒好實務看初選&quot;&gt;趙同意不要求簽協議是不望留下文件被DQ危害「35+」、稱與區諾軒「好實務」看初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷於6月9日初選記者會，表示參選人毋須簽署協議。控方展示謄本，會上被問參選人有什麼需要承諾，戴表示：「我哋喺嗰個協調嘅過程裡面呢，其實大家都有個共識，知道點解我哋會希望爭取到35+，咁但係我諗喺《國安法》之下呢⋯⋯我哋唔會愚蠢到自己去製造一個藉口比呢個當權者嚟去DQ我哋參與呢個計劃嘅人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問「共識」是什麼意思，趙指戴是提及各區協調會議過程，而「共識」應是戴在6月8日發出的各區協議最終版本。萬再問戴提及望爭取「35+」的原因，趙未有正面回答，僅指戴當時表達「協調過程參與者大家係有一個共識，但係我哋自己知道我哋冇需要特別講出」，戴亦有提及《國安法》下不想製造藉口讓政權「遞（應為「褫」）」奪參與者資格。吳政亨等人發笑，有人稱是「褫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指他不太明白，指若趙真誠相信戴耀廷稱初選不違法、依《基本法》行事，為何認為會有DQ風險？趙指因當時尚未有《國安法》條文，而當時選舉氣氛和背景與過往不同，選舉主任會審視報名人士各方面情況，有人「入到閘」、有人「入唔到閘」，故他與區諾軒游說戴耀廷，避免有額外的「白紙黑字」文件讓選舉主任可「問多咗嘢」，「簡單嚟講，就係多一事不如少一事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙憶述，二人大概於記者會前一星期左右游說戴，不公開協議和不要求參選人公開簽署。法官李運騰追問，即趙不希望留下任何可能危害「35+計劃」的文件痕跡？趙同意。李再微笑問，他是否認為不透明會有所幫助？趙指當時面臨「不確定性」，他和區諾軒最主要是「好實務」地看初選勝出者能否成功入閘和在官方選舉勝出，「因為如果就算我哋做到初選，比到市民揀選合適嘅人士參選，但結果未能入閘」，就未能反映當時望集中票源的「心意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意墨落無悔聲明字眼及意思與新西協議最終版本相似&quot;&gt;趙同意「墨落無悔」聲明字眼及意思與新西協議最終版本相似&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成等人於記者會翌日，即6月10日發布「墨落無悔」聲明書，提及前一日「戴耀廷教授召開記者會交待初選細節，表示不會要求參選人簽署共同綱領」。控方將「35+立會過半 民主派新西協調機制協議」文件與「墨落無悔」一同展示，趙確認當中「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」的條款一致；而就「五大訴求」的字眼亦類似，只是新西協議稱「特赦抗爭者」，「墨落無悔」稱「撤銷所有抗爭者控罪」；兩者亦有提及若支持度不足，須表明停止選舉工程。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，他們能自行比對兩份文件，無需要求證人閱讀，並問趙會否同意「墨落無悔」兩點聲明的字眼和意思與該份協議相似（bear resemblance）？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷曾稱不用簽協議是他個人決定-趙同意戴是計劃領袖&quot;&gt;戴耀廷曾稱不用簽協議是他「個人決定」 趙同意戴是計劃「領袖」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示WhatsApp紀錄，顯示戴耀廷於6月11日，曾向新西、新東、九西、超級區議會發送廣播訊息，提及：「我先向大家致歉，不用簽署協議是我個人的決定。我不希望由我手上產生一張有可能被政府用來DQ人的名單。在國安法的陰影下，每個人被DQ的風險都很高，我不想由我的手去製造借口給政府去DQ任何人。」戴翌日亦在Facebook公開該訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問，故毋須簽署協議的決定是戴耀廷個人，抑或趙家賢和區諾軒與戴討論後得出？趙指他與區曾游說戴毋須簽署，而戴經思考後在6月9日記者會作此決定。李運騰續指，有趣的是趙稱戴接納了他和區諾軒的建議，但此處戴卻認為決定是他個人責任，是否代表戴是整個計劃的領袖（leader）？趙答「冇錯」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱本土派對毋須簽協議超級大意見對傳統泛民互信度不足-惟戴耀廷可作證&quot;&gt;趙稱本土派對毋須簽協議「超級大意見」、對傳統泛民「互信度不足」 惟戴耀廷可作證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴續在訊息表示，「我事前應先諮詢大家的意見，未有這樣做，實是不符程序的，為此我必須向大家再次表示歉意」。萬問戴是否未諮詢參與者便決定毋須簽署協議，趙指戴在記者會前還在思考是否需簽協議，並向他提及會諮詢與會者意見；但若根據戴在此訊息的說法，「佢應該冇所有人去諮詢，可能只係某幾個人了解咗意見咁解」，並指「咁當然喺嗰時嘅情況，本土抗爭派係超級大意見」，鄒家成和林卓廷發笑。延伸庭的黃之鋒與袁嘉蔚對望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問及其意思，李運騰亦問是指本土派在「墨落無悔」發布前已有強烈意見？趙解釋，本土抗爭派對於與整個民主陣營下傳統民主派光譜一起參與這件事，「好明顯個互信度係極之不足」，並指協調會議「既然大家協調好咗達成共識、主要係戴耀廷做決定同大家傾時，戴耀廷係可以對當中嘅事情做證」。延伸庭有被告稱：「咩呀？」，黃之鋒則皺眉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意法官陳慶偉指，戴能對協調會議上發生的事，包括各方達成的共識作證。陳續問，趙早前稱民主陣營光譜很闊，例如在否決財政預算案上，社民連提出反對但本土抗爭派卻支持，部分選區同意文件使用「會運用」否決權；而雖然參與者未必完全同意否決預算案，但戴還是做了決定？趙同意。陳續指，即使毋須簽署協議文件，但戴仍可為會上的協議作證，並決定究竟同意了什麼，趙回答：「當時嘅情況係咁樣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴稱是否簽署聲明是大家自行決定-趙確認九東新西夾附聲明惟非民動官方文件&quot;&gt;戴稱是否簽署聲明是大家自行決定 趙確認九東新西夾附聲明惟非民動官方文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴續在訊息指：「是否簽署聯合的聲明，確立之前的承諾，是大家自行的決定。無論是怎樣，我都會尊重。我只是希望大家仍能信任我，將來若出現紛爭，我會真誠地見證大家的協議是甚麼。我希望我的錯失不會導致原先已達成的共識破裂，期盼大家仍能保持相互的信任，努力完成接著的公民投票，讓公民能有機會發聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當然，若我再不能得到大家的信任，我也不適合繼續去統籌這次公民投票了。若我再不能得到大家的信任，我也不適合繼續去統籌這次公民投票了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問趙是否知道九東和新西在提名表格夾附「官方文件」，趙指知道兩區有額外夾附簽署了的聲明，但該文件「並不是我哋本身民主動力去做呢個初選時，我哋活動嘅一個官方文件」。控方亦問戴之後有否繼續計劃，趙確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷廣播訊息未向港島及九東等發送-趙稱港島由區諾軒處理九東另有群組&quot;&gt;戴耀廷廣播訊息未向港島及九東等發送 趙稱港島由區諾軒處理、九東另有群組&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，為何戴將上述訊息傳給新西、新東、九西、超級區議會4區，卻沒有傳給香港島、九龍東及衞生服務界？趙表示區諾軒是香港島前任立法會議員，戴就港島事宜「就交畀區諾軒去處理」，亦無建立港島的廣播群組，趙並在法官追問下確認戴有向他如此提及。至於衞生服務界，趙表示知道他們從來沒有開過會議，他亦無參與前期溝通故不清楚；另就九龍東，趙解釋該區的區議員及義工在實務工作上已開設群組，已有很多不同的溝通渠道，因此沒有另外再開廣播群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷於6月12日再向新西、新東、九西和超級區議會4區以廣播訊息發出民主動力的提名表格，翌日再發出修訂提名表格的下載連結。李運騰再關注為何只向該4區發送，趙重申香港島「戴耀廷就主力交咗畀區諾軒」，而九龍東有區議員和義工的群組，「我相信戴耀廷用咗另外一啲方法將呢啲資訊作出發放」，並確認民主動力曾在Facebook發文讓人下載相關表格。趙並確認九龍東有「秘書處」，被問誰負責，趙稱只知道有很多九東的區議員和義工幫手，李運騰問是否包括區議會主席，趙指他作為領導應有參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴耀廷區諾軒就協調會議做見證已足夠-即使沒簽紙亦是互相同意的協議&quot;&gt;趙稱戴耀廷區諾軒就協調會議做見證已「足夠」 即使沒簽紙亦是「互相同意的協議」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒6月19日於組織者群組發訊息回應「墨落無悔」發起人，提及：「我覺得有樣嘢要講清楚：由頭到尾我理解個協議唔係冇咗，而係冇喺記者會公開。至於內文係乜嘢，唔同人有唔同嘅詮釋方法」，又指不介意承認當初記者會「出於好心，結果換來千夫所指」，但不希望候選人將責任歸咎其他候選人和產生不信任，並指部份選區決定再啟會議商量恰當的處理方法。區又指：「同埋有樣嘢我真係忍唔住講——完全唔明白逼人簽份嘢係咪真係咁緊要，我係要出賣你，簽完我都可以背叛，你捉着痛腳咩。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢則回應：「屯門張可森依幾條友就擺明係要隊到行啦⋯⋯仲有大家之前開咗會嘅協議，區軒同埋Benny係有白紙黑字circulate畀大家確認，雖然冇最後簽紙，但係呢個都係一個mutually agreed consents」，「我諗清楚講明，到時區軒同埋benny都會就住啲事情做見證，其實呢個已經足夠」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問及「幾條友」指誰，趙指是包括「墨落無悔」發起人之一的鄒家成和梁晃維，又指「我當時比較認知係張可森」，至於區提及有部分選區決定再啟會議，趙表示從訊息看到但無特別理會，因當時提名期結束，他要處理很多行政工作。就趙提及的「白紙黑字」文件，他確認是不同選區的協調文件；他亦重申，本土派與傳統民主派互信基礎不大，對毋須簽協議「超級大反應」，惟他當時認為即使沒有白紙黑字筆簽署協議，亦是「互相同意的協議」，而戴耀廷和區諾軒二人可就協調會議上的說法做證。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱就簽署協議無收到民主黨討論訊息&quot;&gt;趙稱就簽署協議無收到民主黨討論訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方問及區諾軒6月14日在組織者群組發出的訊息，時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻託區轉告前一晚九東會議情況，提及民主黨立場是「只要是官方的公開協議，他們願意簽」，趙同意自己當時是民主黨成員。被問到民主黨是否有這樣的立場，趙表示當時他只是作為民主黨東區黨團的召集人，但不是民主黨中央委員，「我理解係無特別收到任何討論訊息」。趙亦指他沒有出席九東6月14日的會議，只是在頭兩次有出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息亦提及「我的建議」，萬問「我的建議」是否指區的建議，趙讀畢訊息後表示：「睇得出訊息文筆係區諾軒用嘅字眼」。辯方大律師沈士文表示反對，指趙沒有出席該次會議，而訊息又是由區諾軒發出，質疑問題應是問區而非趙。但萬反駁指趙是訊息的讀者之一，故想問及他對訊息的理解。法官陳慶偉最後認為，無需再問有關問題，指法庭已知道戴在6月8日發出最終協議、戴在翌日亦舉行記者會，「你為何要問這些問題？」控方遂沒有繼續發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢望螢幕轉為去藍光模式稱連日作供眼睛較辛苦-法庭安排以白紙遮蓋&quot;&gt;趙家賢望螢幕轉為去藍光模式稱連日作供眼睛較辛苦 法庭安排以白紙遮蓋&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，今天早休後，趙家賢舉手表示：「法官閣下，我希望可唔可以喺中午開庭之後可以將呢個螢幕轉去藍光嘅模式，因為睇咗幾日之後其實隻眼比較上辛苦」。陳慶偉指會嘗試，但不能作出承諾。陳仲衡問能否向證人提供文件的紙本，萬德豪指並不可行，因有大量文件。陳續向趙指，若他感到不適可隨時通知法庭，可安排休庭讓他休息，又指政府只會提供最基本的東西，對此並無期望，有人發笑。陳續提議，趙可觀看前方的大螢幕投影，趙指「法官閣下⋯⋯多謝你提醒，我自己調整，如果真係好細緻我喺度睇，睇到大我喺嗰度睇，費事要轉嚟轉去麻煩到人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3名法庭職員續上前處理趙的電腦，陳慶偉提議可將電腦螢幕面朝下放置，並以其電腦示範，着法庭職員「將佢拍落嚟啊唔該」，萬德豪亦一度問能否關掉螢幕。職員處理期間，陳再提議可在螢幕上貼上A4紙，職員其後在趙的螢幕貼上三張白紙。鄭達鴻、鄒家成等發笑，有人說痴線。趙其後作供時，螢幕均被白紙遮蓋，惟他甚少抬頭望向前方大螢幕，而是改為望向坐在其右邊法庭傳譯主任的電腦螢幕。午休後，法官陳仲衡特意問趙情況有否改善，趙指「多謝法官閣下，我可以繼續睇前面（大螢幕），如果細隻字我就睇translation（法庭傳譯主任）個位」。傳譯主任並提醒趙家賢要大聲說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（4日）踏入審訊第38天。趙家賢繼續作供，表示2020年7月首次閱讀戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步〉一文，「我係心寒嘅」，不知道戴原來具體寫下初選是其「攬炒嘅大計劃」的其中一部分，「係一步一步去到一個，我講係『世界大核爆』咁嘅情況」，庭上多人大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而戴耀廷在兩辦譴責初選或違法後，曾向所有參選人發訊息指公開說35+目的「不提否決每一個議案，也不說癱瘓政府」，趙指戴「當刻好清楚知道係踩到界」、明顯認知初選抵觸《國安法》，故發訊息「想統一大家口徑」。法官陳慶偉問，戴是否不願初選參與者「越過紅線」觸犯《國安法》，因癱瘓政府運作本身就是「顛覆國家政權」，趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷71指初選應沒犯國安法-趙稱無收參與者意見有行會成員曾稱看不到初選違法&quot;&gt;戴耀廷7.1指初選應沒犯《國安法》 趙稱無收參與者意見、有行會成員曾稱看不到初選違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢下午繼續作供。主控萬德豪續就從趙家賢手機檢取的大量WhatsApp紀錄發問，其中戴耀廷於《國安法》生效首日的2020年7月1日，曾發訊息分析初選會否違《國安法》，指「35+的目標要否決財政預算案，應沒有觸犯國安法…不過，若我的判斷錯誤，應也不阻初選繼續，因大家已有了Plan B的準備。我的看法是初選會繼續。對我的想法，你有甚麼意見，敬請告知」，戴並指「這是我個別給各團隊的訊息」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙解釋戴指「團隊」是指初選參選人，包括不同名單或個人。主控萬德豪問當時有沒有人表達任何意見，趙指當時收不到參選團隊的訊息，而在組織者群組內，區諾軒有提及有記者查詢得知沒有團隊特別有意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問，戴發訊息給趙時，是否已向其他參與者發訊息？抑或是在發訊息前尋求趙的意見？趙沒有正靣回答，並指7月1日《國安法》生效後，有建制人士開始談及初選的問題，記得當時有行政會議成員兼資深大律師曾指「睇唔到初選有任何違法」。惟李運騰微笑指，該資深大律師對協調會議並不知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴曾電聯趙解釋初選法律問題-趙稱作為調解員只可聽法律教授講解&quot;&gt;趙稱戴曾電聯趙解釋初選法律問題 趙稱作為「調解員」只可聽法律教授講解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，其問題很簡單，就是問趙收到該訊息時，戴是否已發給其他人？趙指當時收到訊息時「冇為意佢問緊我意見」，惟再被陳慶偉打斷要求他直接答問題。趙終稱曾與戴耀廷電話聯絡，戴提及有將訊息發給其他參選團隊，「但係我唔能夠喺呢度確認佢用邊種方法、途徑去畀我」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，戴當時有提及他是法律系副教授，並從憲法方面向他們解釋，《國安法》第22及第29條與初選相關的問題，而「由於我只係法律相關服務業嘅調解員，我只可以聽一個法律學副教授嘅講解」，鄒家成聞言發笑。趙確認，簡而言之是他當時沒有表達意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱投票結果被洩露民研要求開記者會發生事就識搵我哋&quot;&gt;趙稱投票結果被洩露民研要求開記者會：發生事就識搵我哋&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢同意民主動力之後繼續籌備初選，亦確認自己曾在7月初發訊息稱超過二百多個投票站已準備好。被問到共有多少個票站，趙疑惑地答：「251？」。初選投票日於7月11至12日舉行，趙亦確認事後曾發訊息指，共有58.2萬人次參與電子投票，及共有2.1萬張紙本投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;中聯辦和港澳辦於初選投票結束後，於7月13日譴責初選涉違法，萬德豪指戴耀廷7月14日曾發訊息提及：「我公開的訊息說35+的目的，是運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，令特區政府問責。不提否決每一個議案，也不說癱瘓政府。供大家參考。」該訊息同時於5個地方選區和2個功能組別的訊息發布群組發送。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問為何戴要發送此訊息，趙先指「有少少背景…」，指前一晚7月13日，香港民意研究所尚未就初選結果完成點票，但電子投票的結果卻因「技術問題洩露咗出去」，並有傳媒取得結果，媒體《巴士的報》更直接將結果公布。香港民研主席及行政總裁鍾庭耀遂立即致電趙，「要求我即刻召開記者會，想即刻將出咗嚟嘅電子投票數字即刻公佈」，趙遂馬上安排緊急採訪通知，告知記者於當晚8時召開記者會。趙主動補充：「即係當發生咗事情嘅時候，佢哋（香港民研）就識得搵我哋召開個會議去解畫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指713記者會首聞戴稱不確認初選是否完全無抵觸國安法從大陸法我唔識&quot;&gt;趙指7.13記者會首聞戴稱不確認初選是否完全無抵觸《國安法》、「從大陸法我唔識」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙表示，記者會上有解釋為何會洩露結果，並提及由戴耀廷指明的香港民研外判IT團隊的運作。趙指戴耀廷亦有出席，但他「坐到好埋，冇諗住作出發言」，直至傳媒提問環節，有傳媒問及政制及內地事務局局長、及中聯辦均有發聲明質疑初選涉違《國安法》，「先至邀請返戴耀廷喺講台最側邊，坐返喺中間記者咪面前」。這時傳譯員一度對側邊及中間等位置感混淆，並向趙澄清其說法，鄒家成亦發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，戴耀廷隨即就初選涉嫌抵觸《國安法》作回應，其回應重點與他早前發送予趙的訊息內容大致相同，都是相關的法律觀點方向。趙續指，不記得戴在記者會臨完結前公開向傳媒表示，抑或記者會後曾向他表示，他所講的法律觀點是從普通法角度，「如果係從大陸法嘅角度，『我唔識呀』」。法庭傳譯主任一度將「大陸法」譯為「PRC law」，法官陳仲衡糾正為「Continental law」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續解釋為何要提及當晚情況，因當晚他聽到戴耀廷說這番話時，「我第一次聽到佢其實係表達緊，佢唔確認現時嘅初選，係咪真係完全無抵觸新嘅《國安法》」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱首閱戴真攬炒十步感心寒-指一步一步去到世界大核爆&quot;&gt;趙稱首閱戴〈真攬炒十步〉感「心寒」 指一步一步去到「世界大核爆」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，到了7月14日，《蘋果日報》政治版資深記者聯絡他，提醒他戴於2020年4月曾發表〈真攬炒十步〉文章，趙表示：「嗰時我第一次睇嗰篇文章嘅時候，我係心寒嘅，因為正如一個，好似一步一步嘅計劃嘅策劃、推行」。此時鄒家成發笑，在延伸庭的被告包括黃之鋒亦不禁發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪此時指，最初的問題是趙是否知道，為何戴耀廷要向群組發出「不提否決每一個議案，也不說癱瘓政府」的訊息，趙表示：「就嚟解答到㗎啦！」，被告和律師席傳出笑聲。法官陳仲衡亦表示，望在清明節前完成（Please, before we rise for Ching Ming Festival）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢續解釋，當時他才意識到，「佢（戴耀廷）原來之前已經有咁具體咁寫咗，其實初選係佢所講嘅攬炒嘅大計劃當中嘅其中一部分」。法官李運騰問到，趙在記者會前是否不知道「攬炒十步」，趙答「係，唔知道有咁具體佢寫得咁清楚，係一步一步去到一個，我講係『世界大核爆』咁嘅情況」。庭上多人大笑，有人說「痴線」、有人笑着重覆「世界大核爆」，延伸庭袁嘉蔚及黃之鋒也發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴當刻係好清楚知道係踩到界-官提醒不是講述自己推論&quot;&gt;趙稱戴「當刻係好清楚知道係踩到界」 官提醒不是講述自己推論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問回控方最初的問題，問戴在訊息是否表達「有啲咩嘢佢公開講，有啲咩佢冇公開講」，趙回答「多謝法官閣下」，指7月14日他收到這個訊息時尚未為意，但「之後諗返睇返，就清楚戴耀廷係當刻係好清楚知道係踩到界，有違反《國安法》嘅成份喺當中」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續向趙家賢表示，「你需要清楚區分你作為事實證人的角色，及你個人的……我不應該用『揣測（speculation）』這個字，而是你個人的推論（reasoning）和對事件的解釋（rationalization）」，李續指，控方的問題非常簡單，就是趙是否知道戴為何要在7月14日告訴所有人，他曾公開和沒有公開說過的話，並指若趙家賢不知道，可直接回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴明顯認知已抵觸國安法-發訊息想統一大家口徑&quot;&gt;趙稱戴明顯認知已抵觸國安法 發訊息「想統一大家口徑」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢說「多謝法官閣下，我知道，我講得唔清楚，我而家講緊㗎啦」，重申他提及7月13日記者會，是因戴當時開始向他提及不清楚初選有否抵觸《國安法》，故戴翌日再發相關訊息，「好明顯佢已經係認知到有抵觸國安法嘅情況，希望透過呢個訊息係比各個團隊知道喺公開發言嘅時候要小心」。李運騰問，故戴是在警告其他人應該或不應該公開說的話？趙說：「法官閣下，我諗會用嘅係『想統一大家口徑』」，林卓廷皺眉嘆「吓？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續指，戴耀廷的訊息在文法結構上並非最正確，並問以趙理解，戴是否想向參與者表達他「沒有提及」過否決每個議案和癱瘓政府，只是曾提及否決預算案令政府問責，並因此希望萬一參與者被問到，可以「統一口徑」。趙同意。陳續指簡言之，即戴耀廷不希望初選參與者「越過紅線（step over the red line）」，即觸犯《國安法》，「因為癱瘓政府運作本身就是顛覆國家政權（subversion）」。趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷提名期後為各區開設候選人whatsapp群組&quot;&gt;戴耀廷提名期後為各區開設候選人WhatsApp群組&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，萬德豪今提及戴於6月24日，曾在組織者群組表示「我會為每個選區設立一個只有候選人的群組，方便之後的協調，區軒已設立了港島區的群組」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴此前會以廣播功能發訊息予各區參選者。被問到為何戴要在6月再開設不同選區的群組，趙思考數秒後表示，廣播群組與Whatsapp群組功能不同，此前協調會議期間很多時會面對面，而廣播功能可通知很多人出席會議，更為合適。但在初選提名期後，離7月11及12日的初選投票日只剩不夠一個月，參選人要花時間拉票，時間短促下很難聚集人開會，故戴開設群組予協調人和有意參選者，方便訊息即時發送，亦可快速在群組進行簡單討論。趙指這是他從當時情景及實務工作角度而理解開設群組的原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問五一手勢意思-趙形容屬好知名手勢確認沒出席所有選舉論壇&quot;&gt;官問「五一」手勢意思 趙形容屬「好知名手勢」、確認沒出席所有選舉論壇&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙亦確認助手黎敬輝曾於6月25日將初選論壇的照片發送予他，法官陳仲衡問到，相中參選人一手張開手掌、一手舉起手指的姿勢代表甚麼，趙表示這是反修例運動之後「好知名手勢」，代表「五大訴求 缺一不可」。法官李運騰質疑，若控方要問及論壇的問題，需要確立趙曾出席初選論壇。趙確認自己沒有出席所有初選論壇，李逐指控方沒有基礎向他提問，亦指辯方已同意相關事實，控方遂改問其他議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙家賢今亦再確認，九龍東和新界西兩區參選人報名時均夾附「共同綱領」，其中九東寫明「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，新西寫明「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件後天（6日）續審，預計趙將完成主問，並由代表鄭達鴻及梁國雄的資深大律師潘熙開始盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">戴耀廷稱毋須簽協議後向參與者致歉 趙家賢指本土與傳統泛民互信極不足 趙家賢指戴耀廷初選後清楚知道「踩到界」、「攬炒十步」如「世界大核爆」感心寒</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第卅七日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-04-03-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-37.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第卅七日】" /><published>2023-04-03T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-04-03T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-37</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-04-03-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-37.html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/z0Jh4uD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（3日）踏入審訊第37天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢繼續作供，趙上周稱曾出席新東5月5日第二次會議，今改稱沒有出席，由職員黎敬輝做筆記。根據黎的紀錄，戴耀廷會上曾稱共同綱領不提否決預算案「難合乎公眾期望」，鄒家成亦提及要入立法會「癱瘓政府」，趙形容當時本土抗爭派「好進取」、「好漠視」中央政府訊息，想「拉倒」傳統民主派一起運用否決權。趙引黎指，戴耀廷當時望以表決形式定下協議最後版本，會議最終進行投票，「會運用」否決權字眼獲大多數「so-called 通過」，與區諾軒早前稱未達共識不一致。此外，趙亦表示，於7月14日兩辦譴責初選或違法後，才首次完整閱讀戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步〉一文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴耀廷協調會議上提及真攬炒十步否決撥款和解散立法會的大方向&quot;&gt;趙稱戴耀廷協調會議上提及〈真攬炒十步〉否決撥款和解散立法會的「大方向」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今展示戴耀廷2020年4月28日在《蘋果日報》發表的〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉，引述當中第四至七步，即兩次否決預算案致特首辭職及特區政府停擺：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;第四步（2020年10月至2021年4月）。政府向立法會提出的所有撥款申請都被立法會否決。政府只能維持一般運作。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;第五步（2021年5月）。立法會否決政府《財政預算案》，特首解散立法會，並以臨時撥款方式維持政府運作。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;第六步（2021年10月）。立法會重選，民主派或要派出Plan C參選，因Plan B也可能被DQ，但仍取得35席以上。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;第七步（2021年11月）。立法會再次否決《財政預算案》，特首辭職及特區政府停擺。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問趙有否看過文章。趙表示，就第四和第五步，戴耀廷在一些協調會議上有「重點講述個大方向」，他「都知道有呢個概念」，並指戴會上較着重指相關程序是《基本法》賦予立法會的權力、《基本法》條文有仔細提及相關過程。趙並指，戴是大學法律系副教授，而當時參與協調的民主黨和公民黨都有律師和大律師等「法律專業人士」，在戴耀廷倡議和帶動會上方向時，他們並無清晰反對第四和第五步。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱兩辦譴責後獲蘋果記者提醒要小心-714才完整讀完戴耀廷真攬炒十步&quot;&gt;趙稱兩辦譴責後獲《蘋果》記者提醒要小心 7.14才完整讀完戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步〉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，戴耀廷已經認罪，並指問題是趙家賢有否看過文章。趙點頭，指他想帶出的是他本身在協調期間只是對文章第四和第五步內容有認知，「而我真正係成篇文章有睇過，係喺2020年嘅7月14號」，因前一天中聯辦和國務院港澳辦均就初選表達強烈批評、指涉嫌違法，14日當天建制派報章有相關報導並提及戴耀廷這篇文章。趙續指，當時《蘋果日報》一名他認識很久的資深政治版記者，聯絡並轉發他相關報導和戴耀廷的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙欲覆述記者的話時被法官陳仲衡打斷，陳問萬德豪是否需要知道記者的說話，萬續向趙指或不需要知道相關詳情。趙答「係，我想…我盡快講返清楚，個重點其實係想講，佢（記者）提到依啲嘅報導，戴耀廷寫咗篇咁嘅文章，佢自己覺得好有問題，提我你要小心」，鄒家成發笑。趙指，他在該記者提示下，「我就當時係第一次睇整篇文章」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指戴耀廷5月上旬表示統合緊各個區係要簽協議書&quot;&gt;趙指戴耀廷5月上旬表示「統合緊各個區係要簽協議書」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續就九龍東會議發問。庭上展示「35+九東立選座談會」的WhatsApp群組紀錄，戴耀廷4月30日發訊息指「各位阿姐阿哥，新一次九東立選座談會會定於5月4號」，並列出會議時間地點。趙家賢確認他沒有出席當晚會議，並再次託民主動力總幹事黎敬輝記錄會議內容，黎於5月5日早上近7時發出會議重點筆記。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師馬維騉一度提出反對，指趙家賢沒有出席會議，不能確認紀錄的準確性，法官陳慶偉不接納，主控萬德豪並指他並非要確立紀錄的準確性，只是想詢問趙是否認識與會者。根據黎的紀錄，當天與會者包括戴耀廷、施德來、譚文豪、黃之鋒、蔡澤鴻、李嘉達、人民力量劉嘉鴻。黎並指戴耀廷會上提及其他區的方案，包括「重啟政改，否決預算案，支援抗爭者」，又提及「需簽協議書」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問趙「需簽協議書」的意思，趙指在九東，「大家嘅共識係喺共同綱領下簽協議書」。法官李運騰問趙沒有出席又如何得知，是否有與會者告訴他會上內容？趙指戴耀廷5月上旬有向他表示，「佢係統合緊各個區係要簽協議書嘅」，但不記得確實日子，同意法官指戴當時向他指，正考慮要求參與者簽署協議。法官陳仲衡亦問及紀錄上指時任黃大仙區議員尤漢邦提及「黃大仙區議員聯署聲明」，趙解釋當時黃大仙區議員有一份聯署聲明，要求初選參選人要遵守一些條款或約章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡澤鴻於九東會議翌日，在群組發出「35+九東final」文件，表示「昨晚戴教授召開九東立選座談會，會上大家同意進行初選，以上是初步協調結果」，並於3日後再發送「35+九東final」文件，稱「之前的版本漏咗段，這才是最終版本，也附上英文版」，並發出「35+KE final」文件。惟控方指未能擷取相關文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙上周稱有出席55新東會議-今改稱沒有出席&quot;&gt;趙上周稱有出席5.5新東會議 今改稱沒有出席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於新界東，於5月5日舉行第二次會議，趙家賢當天發訊息問黎是否已到達、「又要再次靠你啦」，趙解釋他同樣未能出席會議，故拜託黎敬輝做紀錄。趙續主動指，「主控、法官閣下，我知道有個位我要澄清返」，指他上周供稱有出席5月5日新東會議，但他「回憶返」，其實5月初東區區議會有很多不同會議，故他並無出席是次新東會議，是託黎敬輝了解和匯報。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，那他有否出席4月14日的首次新東會議？趙指，「我之後清楚回想返呢，新界東同新界西會議，我只係各去咗一次，就係第一次」。趙上周供稱在新東首次會議上，鄒家成就否決預算案質疑傳統民主派立場，李運騰當時問該討論在第5次會議有否發生，趙指之後會議都有繼續討論。李運騰續指，故現在趙指鄒家成的言論，必定是在4月14日的首次新東會議發生？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方讀出多則黎敬輝就新東第二次會議的紀錄-戴耀廷稱不提否決預算案難符公眾期望&quot;&gt;控方讀出多則黎敬輝就新東第二次會議的紀錄 戴耀廷稱不提否決預算案難符公眾期望&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示黎敬輝於會議翌日凌晨約2時半發出的紀錄，提及時任沙田區議會主席程張迎及「豐」，趙指「豐」為公民黨高級職員。黎的紀錄顯示：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;程張迎：有人提及如講明否決預算案，可能觸及基本法相關不支持體制而有被DQ風險，否決預算案是由CP提出&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Benny（即戴耀廷）：綱領不提及否決預算案難合乎公眾期望，可能需DQ出現時，Plan B代為表達意見。如政府都會玩得太盡，全部DQ，可能要杯葛選舉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;豐 CP.：對，不能迴避否決預算案的方向&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Benny：會議共識是較多數人的認同，接納可接受的方案（啃得落）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;鄒家成：如我們不決意，如何說服香港人於初選投票，推我地入去立法會癱瘓政府&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;呂智恒：兩辦施壓目的令大家自我審查，如綱領已傾向保守，不敢用明確字眼，已正中下懷。DQ我地控制唔到，只有愈團結，政府愈難大規模DQ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;何桂藍：如以基本法條文作出DQ，必引起大迴響，故綱領更進取較好&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Benny：其他區都支持否決budget&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成會上提癱瘓政府-趙稱本土派想拉倒傳統民主派好漠視中央訊息&quot;&gt;鄒家成會上提「癱瘓政府」 趙稱本土派想「拉倒」傳統民主派、好漠視中央訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢表示，閱讀訊息後，有向黎敬輝面對面查詢會議細節。法官陳仲衡問他看到訊息有何感受，趙指看到本土抗爭派在會議上「好進取地，甚至乎係……對於中央政府一啲嘅訊息係好漠視」。陳仲衡再問，會上有人提到想癱瘓政府，趙當時有沒有向任何組織者討論「35+計劃」的發展？趙指，當時有向助理了解鄒家成提及「癱瘓政府」時整體會議的氣氛，黎指本土抗爭派候選人或團隊當時都有點頭或表示同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FpNwvF6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄒家成（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在陳仲衡追問下，指當時「應該有」與戴耀廷討論，反而沒有與區諾軒討論，並確認當時民主動力尚未正式加入「35+計劃」。法官李運騰問，趙收到訊息後，有否擔心「35+計劃」的走勢？趙指，當時留意到本土抗爭派「係想將佢哋想做到嘅一啲目標或者係方向呢，喺個會議裡面係要，叫做『拉倒』傳統民主派都要一齊去做」。他其後在法官陳慶偉詢問下，解釋是指本土派望傳統民主派與他們一起運用否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;新東第二次會議通過會運用-趙引助手指戴耀廷望表決以大比數so-called-通過&quot;&gt;新東第二次會議通過「會運用」 趙引助手指戴耀廷望表決、以大比數「so-called 通過」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指那是趙當時的假設和理解，那他有採取什麼行動嗎？趙續提及紀錄最後顯示：「『會運用』-投票通過」，指他當時就該句「好着重問助手當時發生嘅事」，因他認為民主黨代表李永成在會上的發言「都係溫和」，而趙家賢曾任民主黨中央委員，知道在會議上若有其他團體要投票的話，「我好深信佢（李永成）絕對冇獲得任何授權表態」，遂問助手「點解會投票通過到㗎呢？」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙引述黎指，戴耀廷當時指「嗰份協議要去出最後版本㗎啦」，故望在該次會議以表決的形式「比一個主流嘅大方向出嚟」並進行意向投票，最終「會運用」字眼佔大多數「so-called 通過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱對投票結果感詫異曾向戴耀廷表達-並向戴確認投票情況&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱對投票結果感詫異曾向戴耀廷表達 並向戴確認投票情況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續問及趙與戴耀廷談及什麼，趙指不記得確實何時交談，但一定是他向助手了解後再與戴溝通。陳慶偉打斷指是問他和戴耀廷說什麼，趙表示「法官閣下我而家講解緊」，並稱當時就本土派「咁進取嘅取態」，想向戴耀廷了解會議形勢，並從戴口中確認黎敬輝向他匯報有關會上的投票情況，即「會運用」字眼獲投票通過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙特別向戴提及民主黨代表不獲授權的情況，亦指民主黨等傳統民主派「唔可能用『會運用』（字眼）」，「喺我角度我都係覺得好詫異」。而戴則回應，他有了大方向起草最後版本協議時，會給予所有想出選的團隊，亦會處理民主黨相關情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷新東第二次會議兩日後發出新東協議-提會運用否決權&quot;&gt;戴耀廷新東第二次會議兩日後發出新東協議 提「會運用」否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉亦問，黎敬輝有沒有向趙講及社民連會上的回應？趙指他沒有着重提及。陳續問，趙稱抗爭派嘗試「拉倒」傳統民主派，是否包括社民連，趙指理解民主黨和社民連都是傳統民主派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後問及會議出席者名單，控方展示黎敬輝訊息，提及出席者包括社民連吳文遠、岑子杰和區政聯盟柯耀林。岑子杰終參選九龍東，趙在法官詢問下解釋岑是沙田區議員，故「好順理成章會出席」代表社民連出席新東會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷在會議兩日後發出「35+新東final」文件，表示「這是新東的協議文本」。控方展示該份名為「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新界東協調機制協議」的文件，提及「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，趙確認戴有向他發送。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒曾稱新東就否決權字眼無共識懷疑有不知情黑盒過程&quot;&gt;區諾軒曾稱新東就否決權字眼無共識、懷疑有不知情「黑盒」過程&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前區諾軒曾供稱，鄒家成於第二次新東會議質疑戴耀廷為何用「會運用」而非「會積極運用」字眼，會上林卓廷代表莊榮輝反對，梁國雄代表陳寶瑩亦提及社民連會支持全民退保，最終就否決權字眼未達成共識。但其後新界東鄒家成等發起「墨落無悔」聲明書，並提及各區「已取得共識的共同綱領」，區懷疑是否有他不知情的「黑盒」過程，最後導致共同綱領、或鄒家成認為共識是「會運用」的字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過區的說法與趙家賢供詞不一致，區供稱第二次新東會議的出席者及會上情況，為趙供稱第一次會議的情況；而趙今表示，新東第二次會議上通過「會運用」否決權字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;九西協調文件提會積極運用-趙無出席第二次會議&quot;&gt;九西協調文件提「會積極運用」 趙無出席第二次會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就九龍西，戴耀廷4月28日曾發廣播訊息，提醒九龍西第二次協調會議於4月29日舉行，戴並於會議兩日後發出「35+九西」文件，提及「這是最終的協調文件」。控方展示從趙家賢電話擷取的文件，題為「35+立會過半計劃 民主派九龍西協調機制協議」，內有「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」條款，問趙有否看過。趙指若能從其電話擷取，即他有下載和打開來看。控方其後轉問其他會議情況，惟法官李運騰指控方沒有問及趙有否出席該次九西會議，趙終表示「我印象中我冇出席」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（3日）踏入審訊第37天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢繼續作供，確認「簽署相關選區的協議文件」為戴耀廷原本計劃，惟因當時將通過《國安法》，他與區諾軒認為毋須簽署公開的白紙黑字文件可保障參選人，二人成功說服戴耀廷改變主意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官亦關注區諾軒在「35+計劃」的過程中，辦初選的「初心」有否改變，趙形容區「越嚟越變咗係磨心」，指他出身傳統民主派、前民主黨元老李永達曾指「當佢係半個仔」，惟區的立會議席屬本土自決派，故區對如何平衡各方「好困擾」、就兩邊的協作亦「兩面不是人」。趙今作供亦至少六度被法官打斷，要求他簡單直接回答問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙因太古城和你sing遲到超區協調會-指戴耀廷會後再親口邀民動承辦初選&quot;&gt;趙因太古城「和你sing」遲到超區協調會 指戴耀廷會後再親口邀「民動」承辦初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢繼續作供，主控萬德豪續就各區協調會議情況發問。就超級區議會，戴耀廷2020年5月1日發出「35+區二」文件，並提及超區協調會議於5月13日舉行。趙表示，他當天會議臨近結束才到達，因當晚有「連登人」在其太古城選區的太古城中心發起「和你sing」，他強調自己作為當區區議員，要到場「同太古城嘅保安一齊睇住個情況」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續如以往一樣，要求民主動力職員黎敬輝出席會議和記下討論重點，並在「和你sing」結束後搭的士趕到會議。趙補充，當日會議完結、與會者離場後，只剩下他、戴耀廷、區諾軒及黎敬輝4人，「當晚面對面嘅時候，戴耀廷再次親口邀請我同埋民主動力承辦35+初選」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷於超區協調會後稱已達成協議&quot;&gt;戴耀廷於超區協調會後稱已達成協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎敬輝於會議翌日清晨約6時將會議筆記發給趙，當中寫到「Hin: agreement, veto budget」，趙指「Hin」是指區諾軒，並確認筆記提及戴耀廷、王百羽和司馬文。被問到「賢」是指誰，趙思索一會後稱「主控可唔可以轉頭再問，我嘗試回緊帶記憶」，其後稱「印象係模糊嘅，但應該係張秀賢？」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪再問「lester」是指誰，趙思考數秒後才回答：「岑敖暉」，不久後突然補充：「我差啲想講張國榮（Leslie Cheung）」，這時眾被告面露驚訝，有人發笑，鄒家成搖頭，有人說「痴線」。萬追問，趙在當晚會議後有否與其他組織者討論？趙表示，戴耀廷簡單指超級區議會「大家都有agreement（協議）啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5BzZH40.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問區諾軒是否同意否決財案-趙指區實務看初選作用&quot;&gt;官問區諾軒是否同意否決財案 趙指區實務看初選作用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續問，區諾軒稱「agreement, veto budget」，以趙的理解是甚麼意思？趙表示他沒有特別向助手仔細詢問。陳逐追問，從字面理解似乎是代表區同意運用否決權？趙重申沒有向助手釐清寫法，但以他「就咁睇呢個訊息」和對其職員紀錄的解讀，「區諾軒應該係開場嘅時候講返其他區已經有啲協議出嚟，而當中有講到否決財政預算案」，讓與會者知道其他會議的最新消息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢上周曾在陳慶偉詢問下表示，區諾軒在協調會議沒有參與否決預算案的討論，陳續指，但明顯地根據紀錄，區曾在5月13日的會議上提及否決預算案。趙同意「睇到嗰度係有嘅」。陳再追問，根據紀錄，區稱「agreement, veto budget」是指他自己的意見，而非其他地方選區的共識？趙表示以其理解，「區諾軒佢本身係好實務去睇初選嘅作用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問區諾軒初心有否改變-趙指以其觀察越嚟越變咗係磨心&quot;&gt;官問區諾軒初心有否改變 趙指以其觀察「越嚟越變咗係磨心」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳打斷指自己知道區的「初心」，但問區的「初心」有否改變，即除了取得立法會過半議席之外，還有否加入其他目標？趙重申在5月13日的會議上，他只是臨近完結才到場。陳慶偉指即趙不能回答；李運騰續追問，以趙的觀察，區的目標在整個「35+計劃」過程有否改變？趙表示：「我嘅觀察係，佢越嚟越變咗係磨心之一」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙休庭後續解釋，區出身傳統民主派、在南區當選區議員，曾是他在民主黨的「黨友」，在黨內獲「民主派主流派元老」的支持。其後香港眾志羅冠聰被褫奪議席，欲找周庭出選，惟周庭不獲准入閘，故當時改為找區諾軒代表參與2018年港島立法會選舉補選，區並以「獨立民主派」身分當選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指區諾軒就傳統民主派和本土自決派協作-兩面不是人&quot;&gt;趙指區諾軒就傳統民主派和本土自決派協作 「兩面不是人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指，由於當時港島只有一個議席，「變咗香港島唔同光譜、各個派別都梗係會集中票源支持佢」；而區當選後，趙作為香港島東區的區議員，亦會在地區建設和立法會撥款等與區有一定程度交流。趙指，「好坦白講我同區諾軒係冇乜私交嘅……絕大部分都係工作上嘅交流」，並指他與區諾軒不同，區曾任民陣召集人，「佢有時同社運界嘅朋友會食飯、品酒等等，好多呢啲交流活動呢，見到佢都係好……好social」，林卓廷和鄒家成等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，區在工作上「都會有嘢呻畀我聽」，因其議席來自本土自決派的光譜，故該光譜當然希望區在立法會的倡議和做法，是根據他們的價值觀而實行；惟傳統民主派亦對區有「好大期望」，「我記得前民主黨元老李永達直程喺黨會議裡面講，當佢係半個仔咁，『如果佢當選，我當有半個黨員當選咗架啦！』」，被告席傳來笑聲，林卓廷「o嘴」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，在整體政治形勢和關係的背景下，加上區諾軒在南區利東邨是一個「好實務、為基層好實幹」的區議員，故在他任立法會議員時，如何平衡民主陣營「傳統」和「本土」兩邊的光譜，及地區上市民希望務實惠民的理念，「呢幾樣嘢要佢去平衡，係好困擾嘅對佢嚟講」，而區也會如實地了解不同光譜的看法和進行溝通交流，尤其是在初選與戴耀廷一起進行協調時。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 2018年立法會補選，周庭被DQ，區諾軒成為民主派代表出戰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時法官陳慶偉打斷，指似乎話題已扯得太遠（drifting too far）。萬德豪續指，上述是否趙認為區諾軒是「磨心」的原因，趙同意，指因為區諾軒「經常要就住兩邊唔同光譜點樣協作，係有一個好……兩面不是人，或者遇到好多委屈嘅情況」。陳慶偉指，簡而言之，即區諾軒不能取悅所有人（he can’t please everyone）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認簽署相關選區的協議文件為戴耀廷本來計劃&quot;&gt;趙確認「簽署相關選區的協議文件」為戴耀廷本來計劃&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續就WhatsApp紀錄發問。戴耀廷於5月22日曾發出「35+民主派協調機制時間表」，趙同意當時民主動力已參與初選工作。他一度想再講述答應承辦初選的細節，惟被陳慶偉打斷，指現階段不認為該些資料相關，萬德豪稱之後會再重返這議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示時間表，列明5月30日舉行記者會，趙同意記者會後改期至6月9日。時間表亦顯示6月13日至20日為提名期，提名期下的細項列明「簽署相關選區的協議文件」，萬德豪問簽署協議是否原本的計劃（original plan）？趙指該時間表是戴耀廷發給他，而民主動力5月中下旬同意承辦初選後，「個架構就會變咗係戴耀廷同區諾軒係協調人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4eMSTih.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年6月9日民主派初選記者會&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙欲繼續解釋，惟法官李運騰打斷，指趙被問及簡單的問題，望趙能簡單回答，「否則我們會在這裡不知幾個世紀（we will be here for centuries）」，有人發笑。李亦指若法庭和控方有事想知，會直接發問。趙終確認，簽署相關選區的協議文件「係戴耀廷佢本身計劃嚟嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱與區諾軒成功說服戴耀廷-參與者毋須簽署協議&quot;&gt;趙稱與區諾軒成功說服戴耀廷 參與者毋須簽署協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示戴耀廷5月16日發出的「民主派35+公民投票」，戴指是「新聞稿」。文件中提及「當然我們也不會愚蠢至提供藉口給當權者去剝斷我們的基本權利」，萬德豪問意思為何？趙家賢思考數秒後稱「睇嚟係講緊投票權同參選權嘅問題」。萬追問，是否指參選人被DQ後便會失去參選權，趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，根據時間表，原本的計劃是要求參選人簽署協議，那趙是否意識到其後計劃有變，即參選人毋需再簽署任何協議？趙同意，指「當中我同戴耀廷係有一啲溝通」。他續指，當時他和區諾軒有向戴耀廷表示，若簽一份公開的文件，該文件就「好順勢」會被選舉主任檢視；而當時已開始有各方訊息知道全國人大準備通過《港區國安法》，「所以我同區諾軒會覺得，冇需要有一個簽咗嘅白紙黑字文件公開出嚟，對於參選人係一個保障嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，戴耀廷作「最終決定」並在6月9日記者會上公開說明，當時參選人「無需要簽任何協議」。李運騰問，即他和區二人成功說服戴耀廷改變想法？趙同意，並指相關新聞稿和時間表亦相繼更改。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;各區協議最終版本-除新東及新西為會運用否決權-其餘均為會積極運用&quot;&gt;各區協議最終版本 除新東及新西為「會運用」否決權 其餘均為「會積極運用」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示戴耀廷於6月8日在組織者群組發出的多個文件，包括「35+新界西final」、「35+區二final」、「35+衛生服務final」、「35+九西final」、「35+九東final」、「35+新東final」及「35+港島final」。趙確認，超區、衞生服務、九西、九東及港島均提及「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，而新東和新西則提及「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢因母親節派花缺席新西第二次會議-引助手稱已達共識全部通過會運用&quot;&gt;趙家賢因母親節派花缺席新西第二次會議 引助手稱已達共識、「全部通過『會運用』」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方今亦就新界西會議發問。新界西於5月8日晚上舉行第二次會議，趙家賢曾在會前向黎敬輝傳訊息稱「I count on you」。趙表示因會議翌日早上「我要喺太古城派鮮花康乃馨慶祝母親節」，「我唔打算出席有關會議」，故託黎幫他做筆記，黎亦有回應他「你休息吓啦，等我嚟啦」，此時在延伸庭的被告高呼「Wow！」，黃之鋒則大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在會議完結當晚約9時半，曾向黎發訊息問及會議進度，黎回應：「新西搞掂」，趙解釋是指新西協調會議已達成共識，協議亦已完成。黎翌日向趙發出會議筆記，提及戴耀廷稱「行動綱領 五大訴求 缺一不可，運用／積極運用 否決財政預算案」，黎亦寫下「全部通過 『會運用』」，並指黃偉賢稱「總結會否決財政預算案」。趙指黃為時任元朗區議會主席，戴耀廷當時找他主持新界西會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙助手留意戴耀廷會否亂講嘢-指民動未答應承辦初選戴於新西會議表示已邀請&quot;&gt;趙助手留意戴耀廷會否「亂講嘢」 指民動未答應承辦初選戴於新西會議表示已邀請&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷於會議翌日發出「35+新西final」，稱「這是協議文件」。法官陳仲衡問趙有否與戴耀廷談及該會議及文件，趙指戴於5月初邀請民主動力承辦初選，當時他回應「我哋要去考慮」；而他沒有出席5月5日的新東會議，「但我都有提我嘅助手留意戴耀廷會唔會又亂講嘢」，即在他們仍考慮時向與會者稱已邀請民主動力幫手。林卓廷等發笑，在延伸庭的袁嘉蔚亦不禁發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，故其助手有留意會上討論初選的細節，而就5月8日的新西會議，其助手和相關筆記都有反映，「戴耀廷喺冇同我確認同得到我同意嘅情況下，佢已經向咗與會者講述，邀請咗民主動力做初選」，並再透過民主動力找香港民意研究所做初選的投票系統工作。惟趙強調當時民主動力「係未回應，未應承承辦個初選」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">趙家賢：兩辦譴責初選後始讀畢〈真攬炒十步〉 指新東投票通過「會運用」否決權 趙家賢：說服戴耀廷毋須參選人簽協議 區諾軒辦初選「越嚟越變咗磨心」</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第卅六日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-31-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-36.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第卅六日】" /><published>2023-03-31T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-03-31T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-36</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-31-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-36.html">&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;趙家賢：戴耀廷新東會上指當選後任期或只有七個月 鄒家成對傳統民主派有「好強烈批評」&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RxmQqIH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（31日）踏入審訊第36天。趙家賢今繼續作供，稱2020年4月的新界東首次協調會議上，有本土派質疑民主動力是「大台」，不希望民主動力參與協調；又指有本土派提及支持戴耀廷「攬炒」文章，戴並以比文章「溫和好多」的字眼解釋望運用《基本法》權力否決預算案，作為籌碼與中共談判，並指當選後預計任期可能只有七個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙並指，戴會上提及應要有「共同綱領」，他會收集大家意見並幫忙起草，並倡運用「積極運用」否決權字眼。惟民主黨等傳統泛民表示疑慮，鄒家成對此作出「好強烈嘅批評」，認為民意是「要選到抗爭嘅人士入到立法會，要用盡方法去迫政府回應五大訴求」，倡用更進取的「會否決」。不過趙承認，他當日開會遲到，會上亦用電腦工作，「整體嚟講係冇特別留意」會上內容。此外，在法官關注下，趙今表示其房間內仍管有本案供詞，法官要求控方安排取走。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢房間仍管有供詞-官着控方安排取走&quot;&gt;趙家賢房間仍管有供詞 官着控方安排取走&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢繼續作供。今甫開庭，法官陳仲衡便關注趙家賢的書面供詞是否已全交控方。主控萬德豪指理解所有材料應交由懲教看管，但可向證人確認，遂問趙現在仍是否管有為警方錄取的供詞。趙思考5秒後答「係」，有被告發笑。萬再問他昨天作供後有否閱讀供詞，趙答「我冇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問，本案供詞和相關文件是由懲教抑或由趙保管？趙答「喺我嘅……嗰個房間裡面」，李遂要求安排取走相關文件直至趙作供完畢，萬德豪稱會看看有什麼可以做。李再向趙指，因他正在作供，除非獲法庭許可，不得閱讀供詞協助記憶，又指這並非對他的特別對待，而是適用於所有控方證人。趙答「清楚明白，法官閣下」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官關注抗爭英譯resistance較被動&quot;&gt;法官關注「抗爭」英譯「resistance」較被動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示戴耀廷3月31日文章〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉。法官李運騰一度提出翻譯的問題，指「抗爭」被譯作「resistance」，但似乎只是譯出「抗」字，即「抵抗」，是較被動的意思；但李認為「爭」有「struggle」和「competition」的意思，較為主動，又笑言並非想打斷盤問，只是對翻譯感到不舒服。萬德豪指他並不適合提議更好的字眼。趙家賢表示，他之前有看過文章標題，亦透過一些帖文的轉發節錄看過其中兩段，「但係整體嘅文章我就冇咁樣睇過」，「我都係啱啱先睇到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑控方提問方式-官指三法官均具經驗&quot;&gt;辯方質疑控方提問方式 官指三法官均具經驗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示多則4月的WhatsApp廣播訊息，提及有關九龍西、新界東和新界西等協調會議的時間地點，惟發送者一欄均顯示為一組數字和「@broadcast」。趙家賢指是由戴耀廷透過廣播發給一眾人士包括他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師 Trevor Beel 質疑，控方一直在問問題，究竟是控方在作證抑或趙家賢在作證。李運騰指他有同樣疑問，但趙已確認過該些訊息紀錄，技術上已納為證據，至於有否證據價值只能留待控方繼續發問再決定。大律師馬維騉亦質疑，無證據證明廣播訊息發送予其他參與者，李表示明白，但指控方的問題並非證據，保證「我們三個都是很有經驗的法官，我們知道證據與問題的分別」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱414新東首次會議有本土派指民動是大台&quot;&gt;趙稱4.14新東首次會議有本土派指民動是「大台」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引訊息，顯示戴耀廷發送各個會議的資訊後，趙曾問會議是否延期，趙在控方詢問下確認新東會議依舊於4月14日舉行。李運騰指區諾軒早前已就各會議的日期作供，辯方亦沒有爭議，關注控方為何要發問，萬德豪指「法官閣下你待會就知道了」，被告席傳來「wow」。李指若開會日期不受爭議，控方可直接發問，萬稱不認為會花很多時間，又指稱「你將會知道（you will see）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示WhatsApp紀錄，其中在新東首次會議舉行的4月14日，趙家賢曾問戴耀廷當晚有多少人參與，戴有回應並發出名單。趙解釋當時想了解新東會議有什麼持分者，因不同政治光譜的團體或人士可能對如何協調、是否用初選有不同意見，「所以特別作為調解員嗰個思維，就要好好準備一啲背景資料」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認有列席新東首次會議。根據WhatsApp紀錄，民主動力總幹事黎敬輝當晚約7時向趙稱「我剛到」，趙回應指剛開完區議會會議，正在搭的士。趙解釋他當天開會遲到，故曾發訊息「叫我呢個好盡責嘅職員」幫手留意會議情況，「而我呢個麻煩嘅老細」就望他能記下會議重點。趙確認於會議中途趕至，約8時許抵達，又指因新東開會場地教協「要好準時收工，唔好阻人放工」，故會議最盡於9時半完成。趙並指，抵達後他仍以個人電腦處理區議會工作，着黎敬輝繼續幫手記錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，即他沒有留意（not paying attention）會上內容？趙指「可能有啲起哄位會留意，但係整體嚟講係冇特別留意」，指當時因為人多，各人也只是在講解自己的團體。李問即當時有熱熾的辯論？趙指當時與會者看到民主動力在場，「咁因為直接開名講民主動力，咁我會豎起隻耳仔聽」，並指本土派會覺得民主動力是「民主派嘅大台」，「因而佢哋會覺得，叫做任何協調或者做初選呢，係唔應該有民主動力嘅參與」，他亦有些回應，但不記得詳細內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎敬輝會後發給趙的訊息，提及出席者包括戴耀廷、鍾錦麟、陳志全、林卓廷代表莊榮輝和「旭」 、何桂藍、鄒家成、楊岳橋代表「豐」、郭永健和「將青力」等。趙確認鍾錦麟以西貢區議會主席身分出席，又指「將青力」是新興的本土派政治組織「將軍澳青年力量」。李運騰問，根據趙的記憶，黎敬輝有關出席者的紀錄是否準確？趙指準確。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎敬輝紀錄指戴耀廷會上提共同綱領原則迫政府解散立法會&quot;&gt;黎敬輝紀錄指戴耀廷會上提「共同綱領」原則迫政府解散立法會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息續顯示，黎指將軍澳青年力量曾提「必須有共同綱領」，而戴耀廷則提及「共同綱領原則是否決預算案，迫政府解散立法會，今次任期可能只有七個月」。李續問，知道趙在會議期間並非完全專心，那相關筆記是否與趙的記憶相符？趙指「大體係一致嘅，因為其實當時我有啲聽到覺得重要嘅嘢，但我仲係忙緊做嘢嘅時候，就同佢（黎敬輝）講呢度你記得記低」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡小休後問及黎敬輝的背景，趙指他應在中大主修社會科學或社工，社工碩士畢業，加入民主動力前曾任公民黨立法會議員助理。趙確認是他聘請黎敬輝，指民動職員於2016年請辭並物色黎，而趙與黎會面後「覺得係非常合適」，遂於翌年聘請他。趙形容黎「非常盡責，非常細心」，法官關注在摘錄紀錄上的表現如何？趙指視乎有多少時間予他準備，並指就上述新東會議的重點記錄，「好明顯見到係一種好非正式、只係將一啲重點訊息記錄落嚟」，與警方從民動辦事處搜得「嗰種好認真」的執委會會議紀錄，格式「完全唔一樣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱新東會上有本土派稱認同戴耀廷攬炒文章&quot;&gt;趙稱新東會上有本土派稱認同戴耀廷「攬炒」文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後引戴耀廷4月14日文章〈攬炒的定義和時間〉，提及攬炒的定義，「可以是指立法會被解散和特首辭職，也可以是指特區政府運作停擺，亦可以是指中共正式宣佈一國兩制結束」，又指若預算案被拒絕通過，特首可解散立法會，而由於法案一般在5月表決，故最早出現解散立法會的時機是新一屆立法會會期開始後大概7個多月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同樣表示從來沒有看過整篇文章，但記得4月14日新東會議上戴耀廷有作介紹，指當時應有與會者提及「啊戴教授你好似喺《蘋果》度有篇文章，我支持你睇法喎」，惟趙指「其實唔係個個人有睇《蘋果日報》、或者專登好似粉絲咁睇住戴耀廷嘅文章」，故戴當時提及他寫了上述文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，戴在會上解釋時，是用比該文章「溫和好多」的字眼，大意是想使用《基本法》賦予立法會的權力否決財政預算案，可作為籌碼與中共談判，又指因此「大家預咗當選嘅話，都可能做得嗰七個月㗎咋」。趙同意上述內容是其本人的記憶，非從黎敬輝的筆記而來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在法官李運騰詢問下同意，戴會上承認文章由他所寫，並順帶提及文章內容，並指因此會上有討論應用「會運用」抑或「會積極運用」《基本法》賦予立法會的權力。法官李運騰問誰提及該文章，趙指「抱歉，法官閣下我真係記唔到」，在追問下只記得是男性本土抗爭派人士。法官陳仲衡問，展示黎敬輝的訊息會否能協助他，趙指「感謝法官閣下搵方法去協助本人記憶」，何桂藍發笑，趙並指「但我嗰陣時應該係有聽到有人咁講，但雙眼係望緊螢幕做區議會工作」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指若趙不記得就是不記得，但問該人提及文章時，是表示支持還是反對？趙重申是表示認同。萬德豪續問及有關「會積極運用」字眼的爭議，趙指當時戴提及進行協調如民意調查或初選，應要有「共同綱領」，而他會收集大家意見再幫手起草，並另外發給有關人士，戴並提倡要「積極運用《基本法》賦予立法會嘅權力，包括否決財政預算案」，「帶出咗呢個嘅方向出嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指鄒家成會上對傳統民主派顧慮有好強烈批評&quot;&gt;趙指鄒家成會上對傳統民主派顧慮有「好強烈批評」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，當時傳統泛民主派政黨如民主黨曾表示疑慮，指「難道起醫院、起學校嘅撥款都反對？」，他形容會上有「少少火花」，「好記得本案嘅被告之一，鄒家成，佢就對於傳統民主派嘅依啲顧慮作出好強烈嘅批評」，指鄒認為「民意」是「要選到抗爭嘅人士入到立法會，要用盡方法去迫政府回應五大訴求」，故字眼上應用「更進取」的「會否決」。鄒聞言低頭抄寫，沒有特別反應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒早前提及，相關討論是在第二次協調會議發生。法官李運騰問，趙記得上述對話是在4月14日會議，抑或其他場合發生？趙望前方螢幕靜默近20秒，並答「我而家嘅記憶，就係應該喺呢個會議都有講到呢個訊息」，並補充在之後的會議都有繼續討論相關事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示WhatsApp紀錄，顯示戴耀廷於會議兩日後，曾發出下次新東會議的時間地點，並提及「討論文件」，附件為「35+新東.docx」。控方指未能擷取該文件，問趙對此有否任何印象？趙稱不太有印象，因當時他收到但沒有下載。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（31日）踏入審訊第36天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢今繼續作供，指戴耀廷在初選討論未達共識、無獲明確授權下，已撰寫「煽動性」和「好似預言家」的文章，如「民主派全港唯一領導人」般，稱民主派將否決預算案和以「攬炒」迫使中共，「我睇到呢啲字眼，我係好火滾」，批其行為自負和不負責任。趙又指，若承辦初選前有仔細看清戴的言論，「咁我好深信，我同民主動力都不會同意承辦初選」，批戴「同中央、同政府『頂到行』」，絕非民主動力多年協調初選的「初心」。此外，控方就戴耀廷在台灣《蘋果日報》文章提問時，法官李運騰一度笑言自己不看《蘋果》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴協調期間撰煽動性文章&quot;&gt;趙稱戴協調期間撰「煽動性」文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案發時任民主動力召集人趙家賢繼續作供。控方展示戴耀廷2020年4月20日文章〈香港攬炒大對決〉，提及「民主派現正密鑼緊鼓部署9月的立法會選舉，希望奪取一半議席。民主派明言若能成功，在明年就會否決財政預算案，到時立法會有可能被解散，特區政府也可能停擺。民主派的策略是以『攬炒』去迫使中共及特區政府就『反送中』所提出的五大訴求作讓步。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙表示他沒有看過文章，「但我想有啲嘢想即時講講」，指文章發布時戴在各區協調會議有帶出他自己或民間的一些建議，即否決財政預算案，而趙的概括認知是民主陣營有不同政治光譜，有人「好支持呢種做法」、傳統民主派則「有疑問」，當時仍在討論當中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，「而戴耀廷喺呢個協調嘅時候，佢寫一啲咁樣煽動性、同埋好似預言家嘅文章」，尤其是「民主派明言若能成功，在明年就會否決財政預算案」、「民主派的策略是以『攬炒』去迫使中共」兩句，「整段呢啲訊息，根本佢冇獲得任何嘅清楚明確嘅授權。我而家第一次睇到呢篇文章，我睇到呢啲字眼，我係好火滾 」，趙提到「好火滾」時身體微微振動，鄒家成發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指事前若看清戴耀廷發言-好深信民動不會同意承辦初選&quot;&gt;趙指事前若看清戴耀廷發言 「好深信」民動不會同意承辦初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續不忿指，戴根本在未有處理好所有人的共識下，「佢都已經好似係民主派全港唯一領導人，就講民主派會咁做啦，完全係一個自負、不負責任嘅行為」，此時林卓廷笑出聲，鄒家成亦微微向前俯身發笑，旁聽席有人說「痴線」。趙續指，對他和民主動力而言，「我欠缺咗一個盡職審查嘅責任，如果當時5月底我同意做承辦初選之前，如果我同我組織成員有仔細睇返清楚戴耀廷咁多嘅呢啲文章嘅發言，咁我好深信，我同民主動力都不會同意承辦初選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VlJfZRP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 林卓廷（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙指如他昨天提及，辦初選的初心就是「希望協助民主派立法會攞過半議席，取得主導權」，可推動一些「利民為港」的政策，並要求政府回應五大訴求，強調「並唔係用佢文章依一個角度、係去用一種『攬炒』嘅字眼，去迫中共特區政府係作出讓步」，而是透過議會架構和現行機制反映民意。惟趙指，「戴耀廷好明顯，佢已經好躁動地，係透過民主派去參選去攞過半議席，就係同中央、同政府『頂到行』，依個絕對不是民主動力過往多年嚟進行協調初選嘅初心」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意協調會議對戴耀廷看法無共識-情況如拔河&quot;&gt;趙同意協調會議對戴耀廷看法無共識 情況如「拔河」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續問，趙2020年時是否《蘋果日報》的讀者，趙指當時《蘋果日報》要訂閱，又指他當時「真係太多行政事務」，除了為民主動力做選民登記，還有東區區議會作為副主席的行政事務，以及作為太古城區議員的地區事務，「坦白講，係唔會所有文章都會睇晒 」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，故撇除趙家賢對戴耀廷的個人想法，他作為證人的證供，是否指上文表達有關民主派的目標和策略，並非任何協調會議的共識？趙指，當時協調會議上傳統民主派政黨「係有表達擔憂嘅」，強調當時「仲係繼續協調中！」。李運騰再指，故趙觀察即戴耀廷的看法在會上並非沒有支持者？趙同意，陳仲衡再指，即有如「拔河（tug of war）」，趙點頭說：「好準確呀法官閣下。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷文章於台灣蘋果日報發布-官望控方預先表明-指因自己不看蘋果&quot;&gt;戴耀廷文章於台灣《蘋果日報》發布 官望控方預先表明 指因自己不看《蘋果》&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續向萬德豪指，此前已多次表明若向證人展示文章，應先問他有沒有看過，因若證人沒看過，發問是沒有意思。萬德豪指趙或看過文章部分內容，惟陳仲衡指這篇趙就沒有看過，萬回應只是第一次，林卓廷發笑。資深大律師潘熙補充，文章是發表於台灣《蘋果日報》，並非香港《蘋果日報》，惟萬德豪指文章在香港也可看到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，若文章並非在香港發布，望萬德豪能在一開始表明，微笑指「因為我不看《蘋果日報》，所以我並不清楚（Because I don’t read Apple, so I simply do not know）」，柯耀林等發笑。陳慶偉並指，文章是《蘋果日報》的電子版，認為能在世界各處讀到，此時柯耀林、吳政亨和鄒家成等討論，萬德豪重申警方是在香港下載該文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指本案攬炒有三個譯法-包括laam-chow&quot;&gt;控方指本案「攬炒」有三個譯法 包括「laam chow」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬其後展示戴耀廷4月21日文章〈攬炒的時代意義〉，萬德豪此次先表明是來自香港的《蘋果日報》，陳志全等人笑出聲。法官陳仲衡關注，文章標題英譯為「laam chow」，萬指本案中「攬炒」有三種譯法，分別為「mutual destruction」、「mutual sabotage」和「laam chow」，陳慶偉一度發笑。控方續引文章「很多港人的心態已轉化，準備來一次真正的攬炒，決心要死而後生」等，趙指有看過文章標題，並從Facebook轉發帖文節錄看過其中一句。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱戴耀廷在否決權上傾向本土抗爭派嗰邊&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱戴耀廷在否決權上「傾向本土抗爭派嗰邊」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢今早就新界東首次會議作供，指戴耀廷稱望以否決預算案作為籌碼與中共談判，預計當選後任期只有7個月，鄒家成並對傳統民主派作出「好強烈批評」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方下午續就香港島和新界西的情況發問。主控萬德豪展示戴耀廷的WhatsApp廣播訊息，提及2020年4月23日舉行新界西會議，並於會議舉行兩日後發訊息指下次會議在5月8日舉行，戴並稱「這是下次會議討論的文件，希望能表達得到大家最有機會達成共識的想法。或許這建議未必是大家最想見到的方案，但希望大家在這艱難局面，盡可能達成共識，相信這也是支持我們的選民的期望。大家若認為文件仍有不足，也希望大家能參與下次會議，一起來討論怎樣去改善它」，附件為「35+新西.docx」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問有否出席新西會議，趙稱能夠肯定沒有出席5月8日會議，至於4月23日會議則稱「我應該有出席」。李再問趙有否下載上述附件，趙指「而家警方攞得到呢個初稿出嚟，我就應該係有下載嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱本土派與傳統泛民就否決權討論有拉扯&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱本土派與傳統泛民就否決權討論有「拉扯」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示該份題為「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新西協調機制（初稿）」的附件，提及「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」。被問會上有否討論該條款，趙指印象中戴有提過「民意」要求用否決權迫政府回應五大訴求，而當時「本土抗爭派同傳統民主派都就住個議題有一個拉扯」，因此戴發初稿時亦有表明未必是大家最想見到的方案。趙續指認為戴作為會議協調人，是有「挨向」運用基本法否決權的方向。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，在「會積極運用」和「會運用」字眼，戴是傾向哪方？趙指戴初稿是用了「會積極運用」字眼。法官陳仲衡再問，在想運用否決權和有保留的兩方，趙想指戴傾向哪一方？趙答「佢傾向本土抗爭派嗰邊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡指，文件顯示「會積極運用」而非「會運用」字眼，這是否反映戴偏向抗爭派的立場？趙指「法官閣下，喺我角度我覺得係有嘅」，指因戴若有保留的話，「佢應該要釐清有關政權嘅一啲關注」，惟戴在草稿中已將會運用否決權字眼加上去，「如果未傾得完全大方向同意嘅話，喺我作為做調解員嘅操守當中，其實係完全成句係唔應該出現嘅」，鄒家成和林卓廷發笑。陳仲衡問，故在拔河中，戴是站在本土抗爭派那邊？趙同意這是他當時觀察到的情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問有否出席港島會議-趙家賢一度指記憶模糊後稱應該係有出席&quot;&gt;被問有否出席港島會議 趙家賢一度指記憶模糊後稱「應該係有出席」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於港島區，WhatsApp紀錄顯示2020年4月17日第二次港島會議後，趙家賢翌日早上曾向戴耀廷查詢出席者名單，稱「有啲樣我會搞錯咗」，戴回覆的名單顯示有趙家賢名字。主控萬德豪問趙有否出席會議，趙靜默約15秒後稱有出席，但指看訊息後「都有少少模糊，因為我係用呢個圖象記憶嘅思維……」，林卓廷說「吓」，亦有被告發笑，趙並指訊息「字面上睇」，就應該指他當晚有出席會議，「但係有一啲新面孔我唔認得」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，他是否不肯定有否出席？趙稱「我而家思考緊」，林卓廷大笑。李運騰並指現時離會議近三年，理論上趙當時的記憶會較準確，陳慶偉亦指若趙沒有出席，當時看到自己名單出席在名單上應會很驚訝。趙在控方和法官澄清下，終表示根據訊息，「我應該係有出席個會議嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意否決預算案非港島會議討論重點區諾軒無參與否決權討論&quot;&gt;趙同意否決預算案非港島會議討論重點、區諾軒無參與否決權討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;與早前的會議一樣，趙家賢拜託民主動力總幹事黎敬輝幫忙記錄港島會議。控方展示黎於會議翌日凌晨近4時發送予趙家賢的重點筆記，提及會議出席者包括戴耀廷、徐子見、羅冠聰、楊雪盈、羅健熙、區諾軒、鄭達鴻、周世傑和南區區議會副主席司馬文；亦列出會上討論事項，包括Plan B和投票機制。萬德豪問記錄是否與趙的記憶吻合？趙指「剛剛你向我展示返有關呢啲資料嘅時候，我發覺討論係我都有印象」，但補充當天沒有全程出席會議，「遲咗去，早咗走」，逗留約1小時。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qo0CHt6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄭達鴻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在紀錄指，區諾軒會上提及「讓區議員知道選舉形勢不樂觀，要有戰意鬥志，否決財政預算案」。萬問趙當時有否聽過區這樣說，趙指「印象係冇聽過」，但不能肯定，林卓廷皺眉。趙並解釋，因司馬文說英文，故當天會上坐在他身旁翻譯討論重點。在法官詢問下，他指沒有印象有譯過區該句說話，「但反而我好有印象，司馬文係講過佢個人係反對否決財政預算案」，而戴則簡單回應其建議是根據《基本法》賦予的權力，其後該議題就被其他討論「蓋過咗」，黎亦因此沒有作紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，故筆記上唯一提及否決預算案只是上述區諾軒的話，而其他討論則沒有記載。趙重申這是黎開會後「一個好快嘅重點筆記紀錄」。李指，因此否決預算案議題並非會上重要的議題？趙同意，亦同意會上很多時間是花在討論替補機制、投票系統和投1票抑或4票，即初選的行攻工作。陳慶偉續問，戴耀廷在3月至5月嘗試在協調會議推動否決預算案，而戴和區諾軒又是「共同組織者（co-organizers）」，那在趙在場的會議中，區諾軒有參與否決預算案的討論嗎？趙答「回應法官閣下，喺我記憶所及，並沒有嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，趙家賢今早稱仍管有其書面供詞，法官陳仲衡臨散庭前提醒控方安排取走，萬德豪指已作出相關安排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（30日）踏入審訊第35天。趙家賢今繼續作供，提及戴耀廷以九龍東為初選協調試點，而區諾軒於2020年2月邀請民主動力參與九東協調，趙認為民動有辦民主派初選的經驗，遂代表民動接受邀請，列席協調會議提供意見。趙表示，戴耀廷和區諾軒是直至5月初才具體邀請民動承辦初選，因民動在3月至5月獲資深傳媒人蕭若元贊助舉行選民登記活動，蕭望透過選民登記，取得批發及零售界、飲食界及進出口界功能組別議席。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 各獲准保釋被告早上到庭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢稱2004年立會協調失敗-其後民主派就選舉協調有不同意見&quot;&gt;趙家賢稱2004年立會協調失敗 其後民主派就選舉協調有不同意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢今繼續作供。趙表示在2020年頭，戴耀廷就立會過半達致35+的民意，曾撰寫很多文章和做訪問，開始推動其計劃。趙指，立法會選舉奉行比例代表制，與區議會小選區、單議席單票制的協調和選出效果有很大分別，而民動過往曾進行立會選舉協調，如2004年新東立會選舉曾組成「鑽石名單」，望集中票源在同一名單讓多位現任議員連任，但選舉結果證明失敗，因有排名單較後的現任議員因剩餘票數不足而落選，故其後泛民主派就立會選舉的協調如何處理有不同意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱2020年前民動在立會選舉推動選民登記和做民調&quot;&gt;趙稱2020年前民動在立會選舉推動選民登記和做民調&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問及「35+」的意思，趙指當時整個形勢望在70席的立會取得過半數，故戴耀廷在2020年頭開始周圍聯絡不同政黨、政團、新興組織和政治素人。趙指，戴聯絡了九龍東區議會的正副主席，並開始與有意參選者「一齊坐低傾」，討論如何透過協調減少整個民主陣營在選舉的「衝撞」，集中票源讓每區有最多民主派當選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問民主動力為何會參與「35+」，趙解釋2004年協調失敗後，民動領導層和各主要參與協調的民主派政黨，在之後數屆立會選舉均「冇一個好正式嘅協調」，由各政黨各自參選；而民動則會聯同各政黨推出選民登記活動，到了2016年，更邀請香港民意研究所在提名期及投票日前進行民意調查。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪指希望趙能集中在「35+」，法官李運騰指理解趙在談及民動此前在立會選舉的工作，但認為趙可直接談及2020年的情況。李後總結趙是指2020年前民動角色是推動選民登記和做民調，趙答「冇錯嘅法官大人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱區諾軒邀請民動參與九東協調-望由九東較細選區開始&quot;&gt;趙稱區諾軒邀請民動參與九東協調 望由九東較細選區開始&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，明顯地2020年民動角色不同了，問民動是如何參與「35+」？趙答「我盡快去講，知道個重點嘅」，指2020年民動原本繼續以往工作，但戴耀廷想與九東進行討論，故當時區諾軒及九東區議會的正副主席就邀請民動一起參與討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，區諾軒在2月初邀請民動參與，區指戴耀廷望推動官方選舉前的協調，並望以初選形式處理。區並指，戴當然希望全港五大地方選區一起進行，但因就協調有不同意見，故「希望喺九龍東呢個比較細嘅地方選區開始傾先」，望九東「傾到個方向」後，就可進一步在其他選區繼續傾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙在法官詢問下表示，九東只有兩個區議會，分別為黃大仙及觀塘，而時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻，及時任黃大仙區議會副主席黃逸旭是九東群組的管理員，他們並無政治聯繫，是獨立支持民主的議員。趙並補充，區當時提及「地區上」都邀請他參與討論，指的就是區議會正副主席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱民動角色分享1718年補選初選經驗-戴區二人5月初才具體邀民動辦初選&quot;&gt;趙稱民動角色分享17、18年補選初選經驗 戴區二人5月初才具體邀民動辦初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問趙家賢當時的回應，趙提及2017年底至2018年頭，因青年新政兩議員被「遞（應為褫）」奪議席，故九西及新東需進行補選，「當時係由我，以及民主動力去全權處理」協調民主派及本土派，並達成共識就補選進行民主派初選，亦有地區票站及選舉論壇。趙指，因此民動在九東的討論中是合適的角色去提供意見，並代表民主動力接受區的邀請，列席九東會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪再問民主動力在「35+計劃」的角色，趙指當時是代表民動分享在2017和2018年補選的民主派初選經驗，以讓與會者參考在2020年選舉中是否用初選形式進行。趙又指，當時民動尚未答應、其他參與者亦未同意辦初選，「個討論未去到呢度」，並指待戴耀廷和區諾軒在不同區的會議展開商討後，「我係去到5月初左右，先至好具體係由佢哋兩位作出邀請，去承辦個初選嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱2020年社會民意望民主派立會過半&quot;&gt;趙稱2020年社會民意望民主派立會過半&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙解釋，因為在2020年3月至5月頭，民動獲得「資深傳媒人蕭若元」的贊助推行選民登記活動，解釋當時「整個社會嘅民意都希望立法會可以過半」。陳仲衡問是由泛民取得過半？趙指會用「民主陣營」字眼，指「民主陣營」下包括傳統泛民主派、進步民主派、本土派和抗爭派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ATYtf7O.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 民動於2020年3月23日舉行記者會，稱獲蕭若元贊助，組織民主派的十八區區議員作選民登記行動&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問趙為何說社會上有此民意，笑言明顯社會上不是每人都是泛民主派。趙指「多謝法官閣下」，解釋應是支持民主陣營的市民望可在立會過半，取得主導權，並指區選大勝後，很多區議員在地區工作開街站，也會收到很多市民意見，「我想表達唔淨係透過傳媒或者網上嘅討論，而其實喺我哋叫『在地』，喺地區上實在地都係聽到相關嘅意見。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱蕭若元2020年贊助民動辦選民登記-望取得3功能組別議席&quot;&gt;趙稱蕭若元2020年贊助民動辦選民登記 望取得3功能組別議席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就蕭若元的贊助，趙指當時民主陣營若要爭立會過半，「技術上係有一啲嘅困難同工作需要處理」。他指，戴耀廷本身預計五大地方選區可取得「6 6 4 4 3」共23個議席，即需另取得13席才能過半數。當時泛民在部分傳統功能組別議席較「穩妥」，包括法律界、會計界、資訊科技界、教育界、社會福利界、衞生服務界，另超級區議會亦應能獲得3席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙並指，因此需要找方法選到其他功能組別議席，「先至可以夾埋35+嘅效果」。趙指當時「蕭若元前輩」提及批發及零售界、飲食界及進出口界3個界別，特別希望該3個界別可透過他贊助下，加大新增選民登記的效果，透過新選民讓民主派從建制派手中取得該些議席。趙並指，他與「蕭若元前輩」提出只做功能組別選民登記是有困難，認為應全港民主派區議員幫手，地方選區與功能組別同時做，指能提升香港民主。蕭同意，故由民動協調進行選民登記。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問，蕭望在該3個界別爭取支持，是民主陣營的秘密抑或廣為人知？趙指蕭有在網上一些節目提及。李運騰問為何要知道關於蕭的事情，萬德豪答是與民主陣營能否取得更多功能組別議席有關。惟陳慶偉認為不需相關證據，李運騰亦指除非功能組別選民登記是「35+計劃」的一部分，否則認為與案的相關性很低。萬續就另一議題發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（30日）踏入審訊第35天。趙家賢繼續作供，稱2020年2月受區諾軒邀請參與九龍東初選協調，庭上展示九東WhatsApp群組的紀錄，顯示早前被指為共謀者之一、前觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻是群組管理員，曾為會議找場地，亦曾替戴耀廷轉發會議摘要。法官問蔡是否會議的組織者，趙形容他是「好資深嘅議員」、「好好心、好幫手嘅大義工」，不認為他是組織者。趙亦強調，會議並非由民主動力召開，只是幫手聯絡傳統民主政黨；又指民主動力的「初心」一直是協助民主陣營集中票源爭取最多議席，而協調會議初期重點非否決權，戴耀廷是在後期才更着重討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙強調會議並非由民主動力召開-只是幫手聯絡傳統民主政黨&quot;&gt;趙強調會議並非由民主動力召開 只是幫手聯絡傳統民主政黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢作供提及，2020年2月初獲區諾軒邀請參與九東協調並列席會議，民動角色是提供意見。控方庭上展示從趙家賢手機檢取的「35+九東立選座談會」WhatsApp 紀錄，顯示群組由戴耀廷於2020年2月13日創立，群組管理員為時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻和黃大仙區議會副主席黃逸旭，成員包括區諾軒、戴耀廷、許錦成、施德來、莫劍成、黃之鋒、譚文豪、胡志偉、譚得志和蘇浩。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據紀錄，蔡澤鴻2月25日發訊息提及3月2日九東開會的資訊；而民動職員黎敬輝同日私訊趙家賢，提及上述會議資訊，控方指似是邀請「Jeremy」出席會議，趙指是「譚文豪」。趙其後回應「I whatsapped him lar」，指他已將訊息發給譚。趙補充，上述訊息由黎草擬，黎平時也會起草稿予他參考，而趙記得有跟黎說，「個會議並不是由民主動力去召開嘅」，並在法官詢問下重申，「個會議嘅發起召集，並不是民主動力」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，趙強調會議非由民動召開，那若組織者望邀請譚文豪，為何不自己邀請，要民動邀請？趙指，當時民動獲邀參與會議時，蔡澤鴻或戴耀廷曾提及想邀請各方人士，而因民動過往獲傳統民主派政黨授權做協調和交流，故趙指民主動力可幫手聯絡傳統民主政黨。趙並指，對誰將譚文豪加入群組沒有印象，但同意群組管理員及建立者也可加入成員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WYOcYqm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 蔡澤鴻（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指蔡澤鴻是好好心的大義工-不認同是會議組織者&quot;&gt;趙指蔡澤鴻是好好心的「大義工」 不認同是會議組織者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問，趙家賢是否認為蔡澤鴻是會議的組織者？趙答「佢係一個好、好心去幫手嘅大義工」，李指不是說蔡是否受薪，而是問是否視蔡為會議的組織者，趙答「我不會」。李指但蔡是群組管理員？趙指正如剛才所述，「佢係一個好好心、好幫手嘅大義工」，因他在九東是「好資深嘅議員」，故「主要幫埋戴耀廷去管理個群組」。李問蔡也有提供開會場地？趙同意，指蔡有幫手找地方開會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示紀錄，顯示2月13日，蔡澤鴻提及「有『會議室』可用」，黃逸旭問「咁3月3日去蔡主席會議室？」。兩日後區諾軒再問哪天開會，戴耀廷說「照舊3月2日吧」。趙確認，首次會議於3月2日順安邨安逸樓地下會議室進行，但並非蔡澤鴻的會議室，而是蔡借來的場地，而2月25日蔡提及「如果大家唔介意，我會定出討論事項，供大家參考」，控方問訊息顯示討論事項由蔡定出？趙答「就咁睇嘅意思係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蔡澤鴻轉發戴耀廷文件-趙指蔡為好資深區議員故戴倚靠他助傳訊息&quot;&gt;蔡澤鴻轉發戴耀廷文件 趙指蔡為好資深區議員故戴倚靠他助傳訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據WhatsApp紀錄，譚得志和蘇浩均於3月5日被加入該群組。同日蔡澤鴻發出「35+九東.docx」，指「戴教授做咗會議摘要比大家傳閱」，胡志偉回覆「請大家細心閱讀」。被問是否知道附件是什麼，趙指根據訊息就是會議摘要，但沒有太大印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，文件由戴耀廷準備，為何由蔡澤鴻發出？趙指記得戴曾提及，因九東是各區第一個協調會議，而他認知蔡澤鴻是「好資深嘅地區議員」，故起初就訊息傳遞上，「會係倚靠蔡議員去協助」，紀錄亦顯示該附件是蔡澤鴻由戴耀廷處轉發。李問趙有否直接從戴收到該文件，趙指未能完全確定，重申戴將不同人加入群組名單，會按不同區轉發文件，也可能有不同版本。就此文件，他不能確認有否看過或有認知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢首次九西會議遲到半小時-確認黃碧雲代表賴仁彪余德寶李傲然等出席&quot;&gt;趙家賢首次九西會議遲到半小時 確認黃碧雲代表、賴仁彪、余德寶、李傲然等出席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;紀錄其後顯示，蔡澤鴻在3月15日發訊息提及下次九東會議的時間地點，而同日黎敬輝向趙發訊息提及九西將於3月24日進行首次會議。大律師沈士文質疑控方提問方式，認為若趙家賢沒有要求協助記憶，並不應展示相關紀錄，認為提問方式很奇怪。李運騰指明白傳聞證供的問題，但視乎控方如何使用證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後繼續就各WhatsApp紀錄發問，顯示黎敬輝在九西會議舉行的3月24日晚上7時許，曾問趙會否出席，趙說「coming」，黎並指「而家林建文開始」。黎其後於8時05分發訊息列出與會者名字，趙解釋他當日區議會要開會，故由助手先去，他遲了約半小時到達，而其助手告知他有誰出席，「佢係一個好好嘅僱員」，庭上傳來笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指李傲然九西會上提及較進取用盡議會權力-惟相關討論其後冇咗蹤影&quot;&gt;趙指李傲然九西會上提及較進取用盡議會權力 惟相關討論其後「冇咗蹤影」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據訊息，黃碧雲當日由代表出席，劉偉聰與其助手亦在場，亦提及何啟明和代表David Chu。趙指記得David Chu在場，何啟明則不太記得，但照寫法應在場。訊息亦提到公民黨副主席「Bill」賴仁彪、公民黨油尖旺區議會副主席余德寶，以及油尖旺區議員李傲然有出席，趙指李是剛當選的政治素人，在網上非建制陣營中有知名度和會發聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4LmVYTz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 李傲然（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙並指，去到時與會者正重點討論如何能在初選機制穩固選票，屬「確保勝算」的事務。他記得李傲然「有比較上進取去講覺得要用盡議會嘅一啲權力」，但再之後有其他討論，「令到有關嘅討論好似冇咗蹤影」。趙並確認，兩日後收到戴耀廷發出「35+九西」文件，題為「35＋立會過半計劃 民主派九西協調機制（初稿）」，提及「會積極運用立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙出席首次港島會議後不肯定有否收文件-但確認戴68發出最後版本協調文件&quot;&gt;趙出席首次港島會議後不肯定有否收文件 但確認戴6.8發出最後版本協調文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;香港島於3月26日舉行協調會議，趙家賢當天向黎敬輝轉發區諾軒有關港島首次會議的訊息，黎於7時40分指「區軒開始」，趙稱「Ok, coming」並要求黎記錄重點。趙解釋，「好明顯係因為我趕唔切去開嗰個會，所以我就要求佢去先」，並望助手幫忙將討論重點紀錄。趙最終於約8時抵達，會議於9時半至10時完結，黎其後向趙發出會議重點簡要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問趙之後有否收到任何有關會議的文件？趙指要看紀錄，「因為真係收到太多文件」。至於有沒有從區諾軒處收到，他指沒有印象，但區諾軒主力港島協調會議，「我深信佢同相關喺香港島參與協調會議嘅人有好充分嘅溝通」。至於有沒有從戴耀廷收到文件，趙指就當天會議不敢肯定，但6月9日正式公布初選的記者會前，他曾要求戴耀廷將所有區的最後版本協調文件主動發出，戴並於6月8日發出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢指民動初心是辦初選-助民主陣營爭取議席&quot;&gt;趙家賢指民動初心是辦初選 助民主陣營爭取議席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方亦引戴耀廷3月3日〈反制警察政權就要立會奪半〉文章，提及根據《基本法》，兩次否決預算案後特首必須辭職，「換句話說，立會若能奪半，反對陣營就會多了一個重要政治籌碼，就是以威脅否決整份預算案來換取特區政府在某些方面讓步。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢表示，有看過文章的標題和製圖，但整篇文章內文「我其實係啱啱頭先先至睇嘅，而頭先嗰段都係啱啱先至仔細睇到」。趙指，從戴耀廷公開講話宣傳，可知道他着重立會過半後運用《基本法》賦予立法會的憲制權利，與政府作出談判，「呢個係協調嘅一啲會議，叫做開頭嘅大半之前嘅認知」。趙續指到了協調會議中後期，就更加具體聽到戴耀廷及與會者「好着重去講要使用《基本法》賦予立法會嘅權力」，即過半後使用否決權，「而否決財政預算案係一個好好嘅政治籌碼同政府去談判」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，不太理解趙指協調會議「開頭大半」，是指特定一個會議，抑或整體的協調會議，趙指「抱歉法官閣下，講得唔清楚，係整體嘅協調會議」。趙續指，因本身民主動力就初選的理解，「我哋不嬲個初心就係做一個初選，係協助民主陣營喺官方選舉裡面能夠集中票源爭取最多嘅議席」，而若取得過半議席，即取得議會主導權，民主派過往建議的利民政策倡議，就可得到具體推動和實行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢指協調會議後期戴耀廷強調用否決權-指是好好嘅政治籌碼與政府談判&quot;&gt;趙家賢指協調會議後期戴耀廷強調用否決權 指是「好好嘅政治籌碼」與政府談判&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問及趙參與協調會議的時間，趙確認他首次出席是3月2日的九東協調會議，至於最後一次何時出席，趙則沉默數秒未有回答。陳慶偉其後總結各區的協調會議時間，趙指沒有全部出席，有部分是由總幹事或兼職職員代為出席。而他本人有親身出席九東第一和第二次會議，出席的最後一次會議應是5月5日新東會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉遂問，趙的印象是否指否決權在最初的會議並非重點，但到了後期則由戴耀廷討論和強調？趙指「確認嘅法官閣下」，補充九東首兩次會議對是否舉行初選未有共識，反而提議用退選，即投票日時按民調狀況由支持度過低的團隊退選，亦有討論替補機制。趙並無出席九東第三次會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tobRjdc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（30日）踏入審訊第35天。時任民主動力召集人趙家賢繼續作供，表示事前對戴耀廷3月召開的首個初選記招並不知情，民主動力「完全排除在外、完全冇角色」，而民動在正式加入計劃前已發文談初選和立會過半，是為了在網上「吸like」，亦同意法官指是避免「尷尬」和不想民主動力「企埋一邊」。趙又指，有「使命感」協調民主派出選，稱若之後協調工作全由戴耀廷「做晒」，「民主動力係壽終正寢，係唔需要有任何工作。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，於2020年5月中下旬答應承辦初選，當時他要求戴耀廷承諾由民主動力「全權處理同控制」初選運作，戴「『口輕輕』答係冇問題」，惟趙稱之後初選流程有很多變異，「我相信之後主控會帶領我去講出嚟」，有被告聞言低聲起哄。趙亦批評，戴在民動未答應時已向其他人指已邀請他們，是「只講事實嘅部分」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱看直播才知道326初選記者會-民主動力事前無收過邀請&quot;&gt;趙稱看直播才知道3.26初選記者會 民主動力事前無收過邀請&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第二名控方證人、民主動力召集人趙家賢繼續作供。他今出入法庭時均向法官及主控官點頭，主控萬德豪亦曾點頭回應。趙於作供期間曾提及至少30次「法官閣下」，亦曾提及「主控官閣下」，並在法官提問或糾正時說「多謝法官閣下」、「多謝主控同埋法官嘅問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷與區諾軒於2020年3月26日召開「立會過半」記者會，是就初選召開的首個記者會。主控萬德豪問及，趙是否得知當天有記者會，趙指「我當時睇直播知道」，亦清楚聽到戴提及否決財政預算案是「大殺傷力憲制武器」。李運騰問這是否戴首次使用該字眼，趙指「當時聽直播先知道」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WrRhR6g.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
▲ 戴耀廷與區諾軒等人於2020年3月26日召開「立會過半」記者會&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙並指，當時是從新聞軟件彈出的提示，得知該記者會有直播，「然後㩒出嚟睇」，萬德豪問即是純粹巧合（by chance）？惟大律師沈士文質疑趙已經回答，控方要接受。法官陳慶偉不接納，沈士文說他不是要提出反對，只是想說做法很危險，萬續要求趙想清楚才回答（think carefully before you answer）。趙重申是從電話新聞彈出的提示得知有記者會，但指他記憶有處模糊，不清楚當時會否有其他職員、或有民主動力委員或其他政界人士叫他去看。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱民動被記者會完全排除在外-翌日發文只是吸like避免尷尬&quot;&gt;趙稱民動被記者會「完全排除在外」 翌日發文只是「吸like」、避免尷尬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示民主動力於3月27日的Facebook 帖文，轉發同案被告朱凱廸對〈【基本法30年】譚耀宗：倘泛民議會過半觸發憲政危機 中央勢出手〉一文的回應。被問帖文由誰轉發，趙指「真係唔記得」，但指「唔係我就係總幹事」。趙續指，3月26日記者會的陣容是「重量級」，不同版塊、功能組別、專業界別的立法會議員，都陪同戴耀廷和區諾軒出席記者會，惟其實「我哋民主動力係冇人收到任何邀請」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再問，趙是否事前不知道有此記者會？趙答「係嘅法官閣下」，並指在該記者會前或後曾向區諾軒了解，獲告知原來當時就9月立會選舉的民主陣營協調工作，戴耀廷是獲得「民主派元老嘅充分支持」，「即係民主動力喺當時嚟講，係絕對冇獲得授權做任何協調嘅角色」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，「我哋當然之後要了解吓各方面嘅情況係點樣」，而該Facebook帖文，就是讓公眾看到民主動力「都叫做好似喺呢件事度係有跟進到」，又指「其實只係網上嘅做法，叫做係『吸like』，變咗公眾唔會知道，其實民主動力喺當時嘅記者會，係完全排除在外、係完全冇角色。」此時鄒家成發笑。李運騰續問，此舉是否可以避免趙感覺尷尬（to save you from some embarrassment）？趙答：「法官閣下形容得好準確」，庭上傳出笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪其後展示朱凱廸的帖文，提及「香港民主派在議會過半，代表香港人選擇與中共攤牌」。萬問這是否民主動力的看法？趙答「並不是嘅」，重申如上所說，就着記者會當時發生的事，「我哋完全排除在外、冇參與到」，而當時朱凱廸文章「好似比較上將一啲重點講咗出嚟」，但又不完全是民主動力的看法和意思，故採用轉發帖文的形式。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;未加入初選仍發文-趙指民動有使命感-若全由戴耀廷做晒會壽終正寢&quot;&gt;未加入初選仍發文 趙指民動有「使命感」 若全由戴耀廷「做晒」會「壽終正寢」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後主動提起民主動力3月19日一則Facebook帖文，「民主動力：有關立法會協調工作及回應民間要求初選安排的意見」，文中表示要回應社會對「光復立法會」協調工作的關注，提及民主動力受邀參與九東協調會議，九東同意以棄選機制作協調。趙確認文章是由民動職員起草，再由他修訂發出。李運騰再問，趙家賢發文時，是否知悉約一星期後會有上述記者會？趙指「我冇特別收到通知法官閣下」，解釋該帖文是民主動力就民間要求有初選安排，及就立會選舉協調工作的公開回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙重申，3月至5月民主動力正進行選民登記推廣活動。李運騰問，因此民動在發文的3月19日時，尚未正式成為「35+計劃」的一部分，即使他們曾受邀出席部分會議？趙同意，並指是5月中諮詢了兩個副召集人後才確認要承辦初選。李續問，既然民主動力尚未正式加入「35+計劃」，為何又會發文回應民間對初選的要求？指此事似乎與民主動力無關（none of your business）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙解釋，民主動力自2002年成立以來，就是民主派協調的組織和協作的平台，而這個主要的民主運動工作，「由創會嘅召集人喺2014年交到畀我去管理呢個組織嘅時候，我有個使命係希望可以繼續將個組織維持一個運作」，而有些傳統民主派政黨人士及支持者「都當然希望民主動力可以繼續幫手」。趙續指，他有個「使命感」，就是希望民主動力能在民主運動中，尤其是在協調出選的工作上有所協助，「或者換句話坦白講，如果之後嘅協調工作全部係由戴耀廷做晒、獲得授權嘅話，民主動力係壽終正寢，係唔需要有任何工作。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡問，即他們不想民動被排擠（sidelined）？法庭傳譯一度無法翻譯，陳慶偉遂以中文指是「企埋一邊」，趙答「同意係法官閣下準確嘅演繹」。李運騰指，因此當趙發現沒有被邀出席記者會，他們想看起來是一分子（appear as if a party），趙指會說是「回應」，以繼續參與民主運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指正考慮是否承辦初選戴已稱已邀請民動-批只講事實的部分&quot;&gt;趙指正考慮是否承辦初選戴已稱已邀請民動 批只講「事實的部分」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就民動被邀請承辦初選的過程，趙指戴耀廷與區諾軒於5月初邀請他與民主動力承辦初選，他表示需時考慮。惟當他們正考慮時，「戴耀廷已經喺啲協調會議上講，『我已經邀請咗民主動力去幫手啦』」。李問，即使當時未有正式邀請？趙指「係口頭（邀請），未有正式」。趙並指，戴當時對人講「事實嘅部分」，「事實係佢有邀請民主動力，但係佢冇講事實嘅後半段，係民主動力仲思考中，仲未有回應。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問，那趙或民動成員有否告訴參與者另一半的事實，即民動仍在考慮？李運騰補充趙家賢最後一次出席會議是5月5日。趙指「多謝主控同埋法官嘅問題」，指總幹事黎敬輝於之後會議聽到戴耀廷講法，有向他匯報，黎當日亦有嘗試表達民動仍在考慮中，「但似乎與會者唔係太過着重呢樣嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，他之後有再向戴耀廷說清楚「我哋仲考慮緊」，「請佢唔好再喺其他協調會議場合有咁嘅講法」，並認為客觀的效果「就係令到好多參與協調嘅人士，認為民主動力就會嚟緊幫手做個初選啦」，「當時間過咗一兩個禮拜，造成個事實認知就係：『哦民主動力會做初選啊嘛』」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴口輕輕答允民動全權辦初選但有變異-稱之後主控會帶領我去講&quot;&gt;趙稱戴「口輕輕」答允民動全權辦初選但有變異 稱「之後主控會帶領我去講」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙又提及，5月中下旬與兩名民動副召集人與戴耀廷會面，答應承辦初選時，「當時我要求戴耀廷要承諾，整個初選嘅運作係要民主動力可以全權處理同控制，而佢當時『口輕輕』答係冇問題，而我哋因而信任佢，所以就同意承辦呢個初選」。趙續指，「但當然之後係好多初選嘅流程都好多變異，我相信之後主控會帶領我去講出嚟」，有被告聞言低聲起哄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方問公民黨記者會內容-辯方指趙無出席-趙指望了解其思想狀態&quot;&gt;控方問公民黨記者會內容 辯方指趙無出席 趙指望了解其思想狀態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，萬德豪今亦問及趙家賢是否記得3月25日舉行公民黨記者會，趙答「我係之後嗰日先知道」，並指對會上說的話記憶「好零散」。萬續問，趙是否記得有人提及無差別否決預算案，大律師馬維騉反對指趙根本沒有出席會議，法官李運騰亦指，法庭有記者會片段及謄本，不認為需證人告知。惟萬德豪指，望能了解趙的思想狀態（state of mind），即他對其他黨派有關選舉言論的理解。李指趙已認罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉遂指應問開放問題，並改問趙能否說出該記者會的重點，趙表示是由黨魁楊岳橋帶領該黨數個代表見記者，稱會行使立法會權力，「佢哋係會同政府、依個政權抗爭，佢哋都會用一啲權力去否決一啲議案」，亦承諾積極參與整個民主陣營的協調。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">趙家賢：民主動力20年2月受區諾軒邀請參與協調 蕭若元曾贊助選民登記活動 趙家賢：不認為蔡澤鴻是會議組織者 指對方為「好幫手嘅大義工」 趙家賢：35+首次記者會民主動力「被排除在外」 翌日出帖為「吸Like」、免尷尬</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第卅四日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-29-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-34.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第卅四日】" /><published>2023-03-29T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-03-29T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-34</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-29-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-34.html">&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;趙家賢：戴耀廷「風雲計劃」「引領」本土抗爭派素人參選 爭區議會主導權營造「憲制抗爭」&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1zBZK99.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（29日）踏入審訊第34天。第二名控方證人趙家賢今正式作供，提及戴耀廷2018年提倡「風雲計劃」，以「向政府抗爭的政治理念行先」來尋找「有志之士」填滿區議會「白區」，旨在取得區議會主導權，將地區事務「政治化」並將撥款用於民主工作，及取得特首選委會議席。趙指想讓法庭知道，戴當時已從區議會「着手」，開始營造「憲制抗爭」的概念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，戴「引領」了很多本土抗爭派政治素人參選，並在反修例民怨下大勝，惟他們漠視區議會傳統、「口號式政治表態居多」，令議會變得「標籤化、民粹化、口號式」並帶入立法會選舉，趙認為戴從2018年起將該種形態「慢慢注入，然後『有機地』發展咗出嚟」。法官問戴耀廷推「35+」，是否希望將區選的成功「複製（copy）」？趙先稱「我唔會話係抄咗」，但指戴耀廷乘勢以其作為「大學者、大文豪」的做法去寫文章等，令形勢在立法會再進一步，惟趙其後改口同意。趙作供期間，不時有被告皺眉、搖頭和發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢開始作供-以基督教宣誓&quot;&gt;趙家賢開始作供 以基督教宣誓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第二名控方證人、同案被告趙家賢原定昨天開始作供，惟因法官陳仲衡身體不適押後至今。陳仲衡今步出時沒有配戴口罩，精神不俗，在延伸庭觀看直播的被告稱：「無戴口罩！」，而法官陳慶偉則有戴口罩。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今早10時04分，身穿黑色運動外套、深藍色長褲的趙家賢在3名懲教護送下步入法庭，他面無表情，步履略為緩慢，其後手舉聖經以基督教宣誓，並除下繫在頸上的口罩開始作供。趙作供期間大部分時間微微低頭，語速緩慢、聲線微弱。在趙出庭時，正庭的被告均注視着他，延伸庭的被告亦專心觀看螢幕；趙宣誓時，部分延伸庭被告發笑，包括黃之鋒及吳敏兒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;民主動力負責協調民主派參選-趙家賢及鍾錦麟任正副召集人&quot;&gt;民主動力負責協調民主派參選 趙家賢及鍾錦麟任正副召集人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪其後開始主問。他先問趙家賢是否於2021年6月認罪，趙同意，庭上被告均面露疑惑（萬在小休後糾正應是2022年6月，趙確認）。趙其後同意，他在香港獲得社會科學的學位，再取得公共行政碩士及博士。他在2004年加入民主黨，2007年參選區議會並當選，其後在2011、2015及2019年連任。趙2020年時為東區區議會副主席，也仍然是民主黨黨員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，他於2020年是民主動力的召集人，並指民動於2002年成立，是主要負責泛民主派的協調的非政府組織，曾多次協調民主派參與立法會及區議會選舉，推動香港政制民主化改革。民動2016年至2018年負責人包括他和鍾錦麟等，直至2020年由召集人到司庫的成員均沒改變，而被告譚文豪和尹兆堅至2020年亦是執委會成員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sVGtHop.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 西貢區議會前主席鍾錦麟（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙表示，民主動力是一個「小型組織」，對外講法則是「蚊型組織」，有一名總幹事，一般是半職身分，工作量大時會變為全職；並會按工作量決定聘請多少兼職同事。趙表示，2020年時任總幹事為黎敬輝，負責各項行政工作，小至撰寫會議紀錄，大至大項目的行政統籌，若他請假則由兼職員工處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就召集人的工作，趙指是領導整個組織和主持開會，且因民動屬蚊型組織，很多時對外工作是與職員分工。被問職員是否向趙家賢負責，趙指「大致上係」，但他多數是透過總幹事去管理民動秘書處及整個兼職團隊，並由秘書處負責聘請兼職員工。趙又指，黎敬輝在非開會事宜是向他負責，會向他匯報，作為其直屬上司的趙亦會給他指示；但開會時黎則向民動執委會所有委員負責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢指鍾錦麟為其副手-望安排鍾承接其位置&quot;&gt;趙家賢指鍾錦麟為其副手 望安排鍾承接其位置&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問及民動開會次數，趙指通常兩三個月開一次，但疫情期間很多會議改期或延期，他就會直接諮詢副召集人鍾錦麟。區在李追問下，指該情況應在2020年1月開始，而且整個2020年情況都是如此。被問鍾的角色，趙解釋民主動力2003年區選起已主力區議會選舉協調工作，他會與鍾錦麟分工，趙負責香港島和九龍，鍾則負責新界地區。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，鍾是否向趙負責，趙指「我諗唔係用負責嘅字眼」，指鍾是「輔助」他。李問是否即鍾是其下屬？趙指「我諗用副手會正確啲」。法庭傳譯主任一度將「副手」譯作「assistant」，陳慶偉提議改為「right hand man」，李則提出是「第二負責人（second in charge）」。趙回應他本身想安排鍾承接召集人位置，同意鍾是他指定的承接人（desinated successor）。李再問，趙是否即訓練鍾任承接人，並給他指導？趙指「我唔敢用訓練……係等多啲時間去適應」，又指二人是交流以最好的方式做事，「我唔敢去講到係指導」。在延伸庭的黃之鋒聞後發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙又指，總幹事是受薪，惟副召集人均與他一樣用義工身分營運組織，「我同鍾錦麟都係組織嘅義工嚟」。趙形容鍾「好尊重召集人」，會給予趙意見及商談出最好的做事方式，趙就作最終決定如何指示職員處理；鍾協調後亦會向他匯報，「我哋都緊密聯繫處理返工作」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢指2012年佔中認識戴耀廷-稱戴常與民主派領導層見面推銷新想法&quot;&gt;趙家賢指2012年佔中認識戴耀廷 稱戴常與民主派領導層見面「推銷」新想法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪其後就「35+」計劃發問。趙確認有聽過該計劃，萬德豪問誰是主要推手（key promoter），趙微微低頭輕聲說：「戴耀廷」，並確認於2012年已因工作關係認識戴。法官李運騰問是否與佔領中環有關，趙同意，並主動補充指2012年戴提出佔中運動，期間他就香港政制發展進行了數次商討日。趙指自己當時為「香港最大間調解組織嘅副會長」，故他找了一些調解員朋友，而他自己亦是認可調解員，因此他與朋友到商討小組擔任促導員（facilitator）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xPZLxAl.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 戴耀廷為「和平佔中」發起人之一（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問，戴是否直至2020年都有與戴保持聯絡，趙稱在民主動力的工作上有接觸，並指戴在佔中後，變成民主發展「較前進概念」人士的「帶領者」。他補充，戴會透過支持他的民間組織，發展很多新的想法；戴亦經常性與民主派政黨的不同領導層見面，向他們「推銷」或作出建議，因此於政黨協調中，民主動力在政黨要求下需要與戴接觸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指民動望減低民主黨派選舉衝撞-邀各派人士入執委會-包括譚文豪及尹兆堅&quot;&gt;趙指民動望減低民主黨派選舉「衝撞」 邀各派人士入執委會 包括譚文豪及尹兆堅&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙再解釋，民主動力在民主派政黨當中，是作為協作組織的角色。而民動的成立，是因有數個民主黨派在選舉中有「衝撞」，他望能減低衝撞、促進協調，故民動中很多委員都是來自民主派政黨。李運騰問及實際上有甚麼「衝撞」，趙指區議會是單議席單票制，若一個選區有兩個民主派政黨參選，就會「分咗票」，導致建制當選。因此民主動力在選舉前的數年前已經要開始做協調工作，原因是「地區工作要去到好細緻嘅地區服務市民，唔係話突然間跳入個社區去做」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同案被告公民黨的譚文豪及民主黨的尹兆堅均是執委會成員，李運騰問譚是代表公民黨抑或只是個人身份，趙指他是「立法會議員」身份，因在區議會協調選舉工作中，公民黨已有其他人代表，認為有不同分工；又指譚可向民動提供公民黨訊息，但因工作較忙沒有很緊密的溝通。趙亦確認，是因各黨派在選舉有衝突，故任召集人時特意邀請不同政黨加入執委會，因此譚及尹均獲邀加入。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱戴耀廷2018年推風雲計劃-找認同其信念人士填滿白區&quot;&gt;趙稱戴耀廷2018年推「風雲計劃」 找認同其信念人士填滿「白區」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，民主動力主要做哪類型的協調工作，趙舉例指2019年的區議會選舉，他於2017年3月，已與各大政黨地區代表開會做協調工作。被問有誰參與，趙指各大政黨的地區代表都有出席，並有一個全港選區的名單，如果「撞區」，即同一選區A政黨及B政黨均望派人出選的話，民主動力就有一個「大黨讓細黨」的機制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙表示，自2013年至2017年情況都是如此，惟到了2018年開始就有變化，因當時戴耀廷提倡「風雲計劃」，打算就無人參選的選區「搵多啲嘅有志者去出選」，變相與民主動力一直與政黨和政團組織開會協調的模式出現「衝突」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sGoFYM6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 戴耀廷在2019年3月曾聯同其他公民團體舉行記者會，呼籲積極參與區議會選舉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指民動以往協調各民主黨派，但戴則是想在無人參選的地區培植（plant）參選人，趙稱「冇錯，法官大人」，解釋一般政黨的地區工作者，會有一段時間在地區「深耕細作」，惟戴的做法是找有志之士，「當然係搵佢向政府抗爭嘅政治理念行先」，此時黃之鋒發笑。趙續指，區議會選區有400多個，傳統民主派政黨的深耕細作模式不能覆蓋全部選區，而戴的計劃就是找「有志之士或認同戴耀廷信念的人士」，派人填滿沒有民主派政黨發展的「白區」，令民主派在2019年區議會選舉可贏取更多議席，挑戰本身會自動當選的建制派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指戴望將地區事務政治化取區議會過半議席選特首-開始營造以憲制抗爭概念&quot;&gt;趙指戴望將地區事務「政治化」、取區議會過半議席選特首 開始營造以憲制抗爭概念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問戴最終是否成功，黃之鋒再發笑。趙指「我講多少少內情先」，解釋戴曾公開表示望取得各個區議會過半數的主導權，令政府社區參與撥款可運用在民主陣營認為合適的公民社會工作上，推動公民社會，特別是民主概念的工作；此外，取得區議會議席過半數後，在「未完善選舉制度之前」，民主派區議員便可取得特首選委會內由區議員互選的一百多個議席。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 趙家賢在2020年區議會換屆後，出任東區區議會副主席&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指趙提及填白區、取得選委會議席及撥款等，問趙可否再解釋，趙稱「係，多謝法官大人」，並解釋戴耀廷當時「想將當時區議會選舉，講緊地區事務嘅野，透過佢嘅推動，係將佢政治化」，除了將地區文娛活動的撥款變成是推動民主的活動外，同時循憲制角度，戴認為區議會取得過半議席，便可獲得當時港九新界的特首選委會議席。趙並說：「我想要帶出呢個位比法庭知道呢，就係戴耀廷當時已經係想喺區議會着手，將佢嗰個用憲制做抗爭嘅概念已經開始營造出嚟」，趙補充是指2018至2019年的時候，鄒家成聞言搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問，因此2019年民主派在區議會取得壓倒性勝利？區同意。陳再問，故趙指戴的想法是在2019年前出現？趙答「佢係一步步去營造呢個嘅情況出嚟」，鄒家成再搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指戴耀廷引領本土派政治素人出選-令議會文化起變化-口號式政治表態居多&quot;&gt;趙指戴耀廷引領本土派政治素人出選 令議會文化起變化 「口號式政治表態居多」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，「我想講嘅就係，18、19年嘅時候我同佢（戴耀廷）會喺好多傳媒嘅訪問係有針鋒相對」，此時吳政亨發笑，鄒亦再搖頭。趙解釋，民主動力當時獲各個傳統民主派政黨授權「睇住區議會選舉地區嘅工作」，而他們深信每個選區「一定要擺時間落去發展、服務市民」，若只是短期派人「空降選區」會對社區發展不利，因地區工作者不會懂得如何在社區協作和與不同團體溝通。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，戴的風雲計劃「雖然佢最後嘅人數唔太多，但佢引領咗好多本土抗爭派嘅政治素人都有出選」，而當時政治大勢是反修例事件有很大民怨，故民主陣營在區選取得大勝，「喺之後嘅區議會，以及喺地區嘅論政、議政、表達意見嘅文化係有好大嘅轉變」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙解釋，在未有大勝之前，民主派議員的意見與建制派時有相撞，「但係我哋係地區為本」，故會以議案對社區有最大利益作為討論基礎。但到了2020年，即新一屆區議會上任後，「整個地區議會嘅文化係有好大嘅變化，新當選嘅，可能係由風雲計劃、或者係由本土抗爭派嘅一啲政治素人當選，佢哋嘅取態係好難去處理。」趙指，「佢哋係要口號式政治表態居多」，而且就社區傳統文化活動的撥款，若全部為建制派提出，他們就會以「派別分野」而「完全予以否決」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指區議會變得民粹化口號式本土派素人漠視傳統-指是由戴耀廷注入及有機發展&quot;&gt;趙指區議會變得「民粹化、口號式」、本土派素人漠視傳統 指是由戴耀廷注入及有機發展&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指他不太能跟上，問趙是否想表達本土派將區議會「政治化」，並會否決建制派提出的社區項目？區指「係嘅法官大人，我當時都觀察到係有呢個情況發生」。陳續問，即區議會變得不理智和政治化、沒有建設性，討論結果只是基於各派的意識形態？趙指「大致上係嘅法官大人」，並補充「本身做開地區議員嘅民主派政黨呢，並不是以呢一種嘅方式行事嘅」，但當整個議會文化「變到咁嘅時候，係好難去協作」。趙指，尤其是一些本土抗爭和政治素人，他們在各區議會的人數「仲多過」傳統民主派政黨，「所以係只可以係順住個形勢而行咁解」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙又舉例，他本身是東區區議會副主席，在協助主席處理會議進行時，本身做法是由主席或副主席讓議員提問，再到部門回應，「其實所有對答唔係議員直接問個官員、官員直接回答，係全部經主席去安排 」，故議員或官員發言後，也會有「多謝主席」的做法，「呢個無論係舊陣時乜嘢黨派都好，都會繼續秉承嘅一個做法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lBzdU29.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年換屆後的東區區議會&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟趙指，到了2020年新一屆區議會，「某一啲都係政治素人或者都係本土新當選嘅，佢哋都完全……佢完全漠視咗呢一樣嘢」，此時何桂藍發笑，曾任東區區議員的鄭達鴻和李予信也對視而笑。趙續指，「佢哋對於一啲本身制度嘅傳統係不會加以重視」，而「整體呢個嘅文化」，加上議會內「標籤化、民粹化、口號式」的情況，「其實就會慢慢帶咗去會覺得要喺立法會選舉嘅時候，都應該有一個模式，都會慢慢個民意係偏向咗用咗呢個嘅方式去處理」。此時旁聽的前元朗區議會主席黃偉賢也發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙並指，「喺我個角度去睇，係戴耀廷喺18年開始，係將呢一種嘅形態去慢慢注入咗，然後『有機地』發展咗出嚟」，此時李予信邊笑邊搖頭，余慧明也以口型做出「吓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指本土派素人變得心雄戴乘勢以大學者大文豪推動-同意戴35望複製區選成功&quot;&gt;趙指本土派素人變得「心雄」、戴乘勢以「大學者大文豪」推動 同意戴「35+」望複製區選成功&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，故剛才主控問及「35+」，「就會慢慢個討論，就變咗一定要係集中票源去令到立法會有過一半數都係支持民主價值嘅人士」，何啟明皺眉。趙並指，尤其很多本土抗爭派和政治素人，他們可能只是落區兩三個月就高票當選，「因為係乘住當時反修例運動嗰啲對政府嘅不滿啦，所以變咗佢哋會……我哋俗語所講就係『心雄』咗」。法庭傳譯一度譯作「courageous」，趙補充是「雄心壯志」，萬德豪則稱是「ambitious」。陳慶偉則指，是「野心大咗」而非「雄心壯志」，指「雄心壯志」是正面的形容，「野心」則可以是好或壞，趙答「多謝法官大人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，戴耀廷是否希望將區選的成功「複製（copy）」？趙答「我唔會話係抄咗」，又指「其實當時佢係整個形勢大勝咗之後，佢就乘勢以佢作為『大學者、大文豪』嘅一啲做法，而佢就去寫文章等等，就去將整個形勢就攞嚟更加進一步去推，咁我哋就可以開始喺立法會再進一步啦」，趙提及「大學者、大文豪」時，多名被告面露愕然，有人發笑。趙並指，「嗰陣時我冇同佢有咩特別嘅辯論」，因2019年11月他耳朵受襲休養，過了區選，區議會事務亦開始繁忙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，故當時「整個政治格局或整個政治論述方面，我同埋民主陣營喺當時都冇特別參與」，而開始有「35+」的說法時，「咁戴耀廷就繼續順住呢個，我叫做『民意』啦，因為當時社會氣氛就係希望立法會過半，做出一啲改變」，就開始形成要在立法會選舉協調取得「35+」。陳慶偉再次問，故「35+」的想法，就是戴希望複製區選的成功？趙答「冇錯法官閣下」，並指除了社會形勢，戴耀廷「佢做嘅一啲步驟，令到成個形勢做成」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1zBZK99.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（29日）踏入審訊第34天。趙家賢今繼續作供，指民主派於2019年區議會大勝後，「作為學者，呢個『大文豪、大思想家』嘅戴耀廷，就想將呢個勝選嘅民意、民氣延續去立法會選舉當中」，有被告聞言皺眉和發笑。趙又指戴於2019年12月撰文談立會過半，並於翌年2至3月將民間的「35+」概念加以運用析述，相信戴當時開始對本案計劃有「初步框架」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，繼曾參與九東協調的前觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻，控方今亦確認時任民主動力總幹事黎敬輝是本案「共謀者」之一，惟他2021年7月已離港。法官李運騰認為情況非常不理想，指現已開審多時，籲控方提供一份共謀者名單，否則辯方難以得知控方依賴何人的言行指證被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指本土派素人區選大勝後變得心雄&quot;&gt;趙指本土派素人區選大勝後變得「心雄」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢在早上提及，戴耀廷在2018年推動「風雲計劃」，終「引領」多名本土派政治素人參選區議會並勝出，並指戴當時已開始營造「憲制抗爭」的概念。趙又指，素人令區議會變得「標籤化、民粹化、口號式」，表示「喺我個角度去睇，係戴耀廷喺18年開始，係將呢一種嘅形態去慢慢注入咗，然後『有機地』發展咗出嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，因此到了本案的「35+」，「就會慢慢個討論，就變咗一定要係集中票源去令到立法會有過一半數都係支持民主價值嘅人士」，何啟明皺眉。趙並指，尤其很多本土抗爭派和政治素人，他們可能只是落區兩三個月就高票當選，「因為係乘住當時反修例運動嗰啲對政府嘅不滿啦，所以變咗佢哋會……我哋俗語所講就係『心雄』咗」。法庭傳譯一度譯作「courageous」，趙補充是「雄心壯志」，萬德豪則稱是「ambitious」。陳慶偉則指，是「野心大咗」而非「雄心壯志」，指「雄心壯志」是正面的形容，「野心」則可以是好或壞，趙答「多謝法官大人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意戴35望複製區選成功戴乘勢以大學者大文豪做法撰文推動&quot;&gt;趙同意戴「35+」望複製區選成功、戴乘勢以「大學者大文豪」做法撰文推動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，戴耀廷是否希望將區選的成功「複製（copy）」？趙答「我唔會話係抄咗」，又指「其實當時佢係整個形勢大勝咗之後，佢就乘勢以佢作為『大學者、大文豪』嘅一啲做法，而佢就去寫文章等等，就去將整個形勢就攞嚟更加進一步去推，咁我哋就可以開始喺立法會再進一步啦」，趙提及「大學者、大文豪」時，多名被告面露愕然，有人發笑。趙並指，「嗰陣時我冇同佢有咩特別嘅辯論」，因2019年11月他耳朵受襲休養，過了區選，區議會事務亦開始繁忙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，故當時「整個政治格局或整個政治論述方面，我同埋民主陣營喺當時都冇特別參與」，而開始有「35+」的說法時，「咁戴耀廷就繼續順住呢個，我叫做『民意』啦，因為當時社會氣氛就係希望立法會過半，做出一啲改變」，就開始形成要在立法會選舉協調取得「35+」。陳慶偉再次問，故「35+」的想法，就是戴希望複製區選的成功？趙答「冇錯法官閣下」，並指除了社會形勢，戴耀廷「佢做嘅一啲步驟，令到成個形勢做成」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙再稱作為大文豪大思想家的戴耀廷想將勝選民意民氣延續至立會選舉&quot;&gt;趙再稱作為「大文豪、大思想家」的戴耀廷想將勝選民意民氣延續至立會選舉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪下午問及，趙曾指戴提出一個新想法，問戴有甚麼新想法，惟辯方質疑這屬引導性問題，指控方應問一些中立的問題。法官陳慶偉遂改問：「35+是否戴的新想法？」，趙表示在區議會選舉後，戴耀廷在接受媒體訪問及發表文章，提及對整個政局發展的評論及倡議。他又指，正如法官指民主派在區議會選舉大勝，「咁作為學者，呢個大文豪、大思想家嘅戴耀廷，就想將呢個勝選嘅民意、民氣延續去立法會選舉當中」，陳志全皺眉，延伸庭的黃之鋒亦面露驚訝發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指2月至3月35概念在民間出現-戴開始對計劃有初步框架&quot;&gt;趙指2月至3月「35+」概念在民間出現 戴開始對計劃有「初步框架」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙續指，他記得戴耀廷在2019年12月底，曾撰文談及如何達成立會過半，之後在傳媒、各方論政、文章和評論等，除戴外也有很多人一起討論這方面的發展。趙表示，直至2020年2至3月，「更加有一個35+嘅概念喺民間出咗嚟」，認為戴再加以運用及析述，並指根據戴耀廷在文章及傳媒訪問的說法，相信戴在當時開始對本案的35+計劃有「初步框架」。法官李運騰一度指，希望證人能根據時間順序作供，而且相比起證人對政治氣候的個人判斷，法庭更需要的是具體事實（concrete facts）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙確認蔡澤鴻為35九東立選座談會群組的管理員&quot;&gt;趙確認蔡澤鴻為「35+九東立選座談會」群組的管理員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪其後向​​趙確認從其電話檢取的WhatsApp 對話紀錄，包括九龍東、香港島、新界西等多個群組訊息。就2020年2月成立的「35+九東立選座談會」群組，萬指紀錄顯示前觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻為列表上首名成員，名字旁寫有「admin（管理員）」，問群組是否由蔡建立，趙表示蔡是群組管理員，但未知道群組由誰建立。在延伸庭的吳敏兒微笑，眾被告亦有討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後萬德豪展示趙家賢與戴耀廷的對話紀錄，顯示兩人在2013年5月至2020年10月有對話。趙確認於2013年已認識戴，因2012年在工作上有接觸。法官李運騰引述對話指，兩人在2013年曾就佔中運動找調解員一事作討論，趙同意並指首個訊息是由他發給戴。趙亦解釋指當時的佔中政制商討有3個階段，自己在第一及第三階段均有協助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙解釋whatsapp的廣播訊息功能稱被戴耀廷加在7個廣播群組中&quot;&gt;趙解釋WhatsApp的廣播訊息功能、稱被戴耀廷加在7個廣播群組中&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉早前盤問時曾援引上述紀錄，指「35+新東final」文件曾發出，但訊息發出者為一串數字及「@broadcast」的字眼，不清楚該組字眼意思。趙家賢今解釋這是WhatsApp 的廣播功能，指他經常會使用，可將發送對象的電話加入廣播群組，而對方亦需將發送人電話加為聯絡人，而當他按下按鈕，名單上的人士就會分別收到私人訊息，並會有特別顏色顯示。法官李運騰問名單是否有人數限制，趙稱兩年前他尚未還柙時，最多可將200人列入名單。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，若發送對象沒有將發送者電話加為聯絡人，發送者會否得知對方未能接收訊息。趙指發送訊息後，按實訊息兩至三秒，會顯示廣播名單中誰人已接收及閱讀訊息。趙亦同意該名單可以儲存並於下次再使用，舉例指他曾建立名為「東區議員群組」的廣播名單，發訊息後相隔一段時間可再傳訊息。趙確認他只是以用家角度、而非專家角度理解有關功能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就紀錄上顯示7組數字和「@broadcast」，趙家賢笑稱「本人雖然並不是WhatsApp 專家」，但認為紀錄顯示他被戴耀廷加在7個廣播群組中，但他無法得知其他被列入名單的人。他亦解釋，以其理解警方IT組檢取其電話紀錄時，系統應將他與戴耀廷的對話或關係綜合於此。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙稱原打算分開公用及私人電話-最終兩部電話均用作與戴聯絡&quot;&gt;趙稱原打算分開公用及私人電話 最終兩部電話均用作與戴聯絡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續指，在趙家賢另一部電話亦檢取到他與戴耀廷的對話紀錄，該些紀錄是由2013年12月至2020年10月。李運騰問趙是否分別用兩部電話與戴聯絡，趙表示：「法官閣下，本身從政咁耐，係想分開一部私人電話，一部公用電話嘅」，李笑言「相信很多大律師都會這樣做」，眾人發笑，趙逐笑稱：「但大家見到係已經痴埋晒一齊啦！」，並同意間中會分別使用兩部電話聯絡戴。萬另問到民主動力的群組，趙承認該群組是由他建立，對話涉及2020年6月至7月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指民主動力總幹事黎敬輝為本案共謀者之一-官促提供共謀者名單&quot;&gt;控方指民主動力總幹事黎敬輝為本案共謀者之一 官促提供共謀者名單&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示趙家賢與民主動力總幹事黎敬輝，從2020年1月至2021年1月的WhatsApp 對話。惟大律師馬維騉關注，黎敬輝是控方證人，而他並沒有獲豁免起訴，認為黎因此並非本案共謀者（co-conspirator）之一，相關訊息很大機會只是傳聞證供（heresay）。控方早前確認本案依賴「共謀者原則」，並呈交針對各被告的證據列表，根據該原則，各共謀者的言行均可用來指證所有被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官其後下令趙家賢離席，趙走時向法官席兩次點頭。萬德豪遂表示，控方立場是黎敬輝也是本案的共謀者之一。法官李運騰指，若這是控方一早的立場，最好的做法應是將他的名字寫在公訴書（indictment）上讓所有人得悉，即使最終可能因證據不足而沒有起訴他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方日前亦首度指名字不在公訴書上、參與九東協調的前觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻是本案共謀者之一，李運騰指今次是第二次發生類似情況。他指明白本案或牽涉其他控方知道名字的共謀者，但這令法庭和辯方陷入非常困難的處境，舉例庭上數度提及張崑陽，相信控方也會說他是共謀者，惟其名字也不在公訴書上，反問辯方如何得知控方依賴何人的言行指證被告，形容情況非常不理想。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黎敬輝2021年已離港&quot;&gt;控方指黎敬輝2021年已離港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪表示明白，指應待審結才處理，又指大家都知道本案有更多共謀者。李運騰續指，現已開審多時，望控方能提供一份他們指控為本案共謀者的名單。萬表示，早前已提交「共謀者原則」下針對各被告的證據列表，相信辯方已清楚控方立場是指黎是共謀者；並補充指黎敬輝已於2021年7月離港，控方也不能做任何事。李指不是要控方即時修訂公訴書，但重申望控方至少能提供沒有出現在公訴書上的共謀者名單，又指共謀者原則是否適用將交由法庭決定，萬表示願意提供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉補充，一個人是否共謀者，以及他是否被控串謀是兩回事，如黎敬輝就被指為共謀者但沒被控，但望控方能讓他們得知誰是共謀者，讓法庭之後可就是否依賴相關言行作出裁斷。至於馬維騉的關注，陳慶偉指尚未知道控方打算如何使用該些訊息，李運騰指若辯方有爭議會稍後處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

This transition affects the future of the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act, a piece of U.S. legislation that aims to provide timely access to electronic evidence (e-evidence).&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Despite past disputes over data privacy and surveillance, both sides have found common ground – through the EU–U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)’s Declaration on Government Access to Personal Data held by Private Sector Entities – and created a forum for cooperation in digital trade through the Trade and Technology Council (TTC). Getting to this point, however, involved a complicated process, and despite real progress, the story is not yet over.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and the European Union are each other’s top trading partners. The transatlantic and data transfer relationship creates a $7.1 trillion economic relationship, so this is not a minor problem. All sides want to find solutions that permit digital trade to continue and that streamline the evidentiary process needed for law enforcement in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This white paper looks at the tensions between the desire for timely law enforcement access to evidence, European concerns over digital sovereignty, and the mutual desire for a strengthened transatlantic relationship. The nature of cloud services means that data is often stored on one or several servers outside of a user’s borders as well as outside of the country where a company’s headquarters may be located. This makes economic sense but raises legal questions when governments wish to access electronic evidence that is stored outside of their jurisdiction for an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;genesis-of-the-cloud-act&quot;&gt;Genesis of the CLOUD Act&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a new problem, and enforcement agencies in many countries have complained for years about the slowness of conventional processes, such as Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties when compared to the transitory nature of digital evidence. A 2013 internal government review on the United States’ ability to fulfill these requests noted it took approximately 10 months, with some requests taking much longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflict over government access to data in another jurisdiction came to a head in the 2013 Microsoft Ireland case. In 2013, the United States presented Microsoft with a warrant to disclose data – which the company found to be stored in a data center in Dublin. Given the data’s location, Microsoft argued that a U.S. court did not have the authority to issue a warrant for data stored abroad and asked the court to suppress the order. While the reasoning of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York that material control over the data – regardless of where stored – was enough for Microsoft to comply with the order, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found this to be an unauthorized extraterritorial application of U.S. law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States appealed the Second Circuit’s decision to the Supreme Court, referencing other courts had previously found requiring U.S. companies to comply with Stored Communications Act (SCA) warrants outside of the United States is a domestic application of the law. Before the Supreme Court ruled, Congress passed the CLOUD Act and made the Microsoft Ireland case moot. The CLOUD Act amended the SCA to clarify that communication service providers must comply with legal requests for data from the U.S. government, “regardless of whether such communication, record, or other information is located within or outside of the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the CLOUD Act confirmed the legality of U.S. government requests for data stored by U.S. communications service providers outside of the United States, it also created concerns in the European Union over extraterritorial application of U.S. law. Building on the mistrust over user privacy and data protection that was exacerbated in part by the Snowden revelations about surveillance, the CLOUD Act faced criticism and concern from EU officials worried that it would infringe upon European digital sovereignty. Digital sovereignty, or the control of technology operating under one’s jurisdiction, is a key goal for EU member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intent-of-cloud-act-agreements&quot;&gt;Intent of CLOUD Act Agreements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service providers have traditionally been hesitant to answer foreign government requests for data because of fears that they could be found in violation of domestic laws governing privacy and data protection. The CLOUD Act was intended to address this, however, with a second provision that allowed the U.S. government to enter into executive agreements with third countries for reciprocal expedited access to e-evidence held by providers based abroad. This provision was frequently misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bilateral agreements contemplated under the CLOUD Act were intended to remove these conflicts when both the requesting and supplying jurisdictions share similar privacy and civil liberties protections. An agreement under the CLOUD Act requires an assessment of the foreign country’s domestic law to ensure it respects “substantive and procedural protections for privacy and civil liberties” and limits who can be targeted. Any orders issued under the CLOUD Act must “be for the purpose of obtaining information relating to the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of serious crime, including terrorism” and must be subject to review or oversight by a judicial authority. This provision of the CLOUD Act was intended to create a quicker and more efficient way for law enforcement agencies to gain access to electronic data held outside of their borders by global cloud service providers. The act does not replace the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty process, but rather provides an additional method of cross-border data access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a shared transatlantic recognition of the problem, the United States has only been able to reach CLOUD Act agreements with the United Kingdom and Australia and is reportedly negotiating with Canada. This slow pace means that the environment for CLOUD Act negotiations is being reshaped by transatlantic developments and new agreements on data and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2019, a joint U.S.-EU statement announced the beginning of formal negotiations on an agreement for facilitating access to e-evidence in criminal investigations. This negotiation was supposed to happen in parallel with the European Union’s own framework for e-evidence – the E-Evidence Regulation. Initially, internal EU disagreements prevented the regulation from being enacted and the negotiations with the United States from proceeding. However, in January 2023, the European Council and European Parliament reached agreement on the draft regulation and the draft directive on cross-border access to e-evidence with similar authorities as the CLOUD Act. This signals real progress on reaching an e-evidence agreement between the European Union and the United States and the Department of Justice announced in March 2023 that negotiations had resumed with the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conflicts-between-eu-law-and-the-cloud-act&quot;&gt;Conflicts between EU Law and the CLOUD Act&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a U.S.-EU agreement on access to e-evidence, conflicts between the CLOUD Act and EU regulation remain. An initial assessment commissioned by European authorities of the compatibility between the CLOUD Act and EU legal framework identified the main potential conflict to be Article 48 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on transfers or disclosures not authorized by EU law. Article 48 outlines that a foreign court order would not be sufficient to make a transfer lawful unless “based on an international agreement.” The European Commission’s objectives for an international agreement include enhancing the legal certainty between the jurisdictions and allowing for the transfer of e-evidence on a reciprocal basis while ensuring respect for EU law. The European Commission argued in the Microsoft Ireland case (through an external brief) that Article 48 “makes clear that a foreign court order does not, as such, make a transfer lawful under the GDPR.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article 49 of the GDPR establishes the conditions under which an international transfer could occur if an international agreement is not in place. Specifically, the first paragraph of the article stipulates, among other potential conditions, that the subject is notified and provided consent, or the transfer is necessary for “important reasons of public interest.” A CLOUD Act transfer could also be considered lawful under Article 6(1)(d) when the transfer is in the vital interest of data subjects themselves (e.g., accessing personal data concerning abducted minors). The EU assessment concluded that an “international agreement containing strong procedural and substantive fundamental rights safeguards appears the most appropriate instrument to ensure the necessary level of protection for EU data subjects and legal certainty for businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress on a CLOUD Act agreement between the United States and the European Union was complicated by decisions made by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Since the 2013 Snowden revelations that exposed mass surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) for counterterrorism purposes, there has been increased concern in Europe over U.S. government access to data concerning EU citizens. In 2015, the CJEU invalidated the 2000 Safe Harbor Privacy Principles agreement between the United States and the European Union in a decision known as Schrems I – the name coming from Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems, who has launched several complaints to European data protection agencies over Facebook’s handling of user data. In the Schrems I decision, the CJEU cited the Snowden revelations as demonstrating “a ‘significant overreach’ on the part of the NSA and other federal agencies” and that data transfers to the United States could violate Article 7 – respect for private and family life – of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Schrems I, work to rebuild the legal basis for transatlantic data flows began. This resulted in the adequacy decision of the Privacy Shield framework, a renewed agreement between the United States and the European Union on privacy principles. However, in 2020, the CJEU invalidated Privacy Shield in a decision known as Schrems II, in which the European Union was principally concerned with U.S. regulations enabling certain signals intelligence activities. The decision referenced Section 702 of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the U.S. government to compel communication service providers to assist in the surveillance of foreign persons outside the country, and U.S. Executive Order 12333, which denotes when intelligence agencies can engage in foreign intelligence surveillance abroad. Schrems II outlined two necessary benchmarks for the transatlantic data flows to be in compliance with EU law: U.S. surveillance activities should be limited to what is necessary and proportional and should be subject to judicial redress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2022, the United States and European Union agreed in principle to the EU–U.S. Data Privacy Framework to address concerns raised in Schrems II. This framework was then implemented by the October 2022 U.S. “Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards For United States Signals Intelligence Activities” (EO 14086). EO 14086 pledges to “tailor U.S. signals intelligence collection to what is ‘necessary’ and ‘proportionate’ to protect both national interests and individual privacy and civil liberties” and enables a redress mechanism through the establishment of the Data Protection Review Court. In response, the European Union issued a draft adequacy decision, and it is expected that the legal framework for transatlantic data flows will be reinstated. The renewed framework highlights the common ground the United States and European Union have on access to data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;european-response&quot;&gt;European Response&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns with the CLOUD Act and the application of non-European laws to European jurisdictions sparked a flurry of action in Europe. Developed in 2020, the European strategy for data is an initiative to ensure European competitiveness and data sovereignty amid concerns over extraterritorial laws in the transfer of data. The strategy explicitly states that the application of the CLOUD Act is a risk to the data of EU citizens and businesses stored by cloud service providers and subject to third-country legislation. The strategy led to the creation of the Data Governance Act (DGA) and Data Act. While the GDPR provides a governance framework for personal data, the DGA and the proposed Data Act provide an additional framework for the reuse, transfer, and protection of nonpersonal data. Personal data is information relating to identifiable individuals, whereas nonpersonal data is information not related to an identifiable person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both acts aim to ensure that Europe benefits from the data it creates. The DGA looks to make more data available, combat technical barriers in data reuse, and advance trust in data sharing across the European Union. The Data Act tackles the question of who can create value from European data and where this can take place. In the DGA, international access and transfer of EU data is limited – compliance with a third-country decision that compels the disclosure of data held in the European Union must be based on an international agreement between the third country and the European Union or a member state. In the absence of an international agreement, Article 31 outlines that foreign access requests are honored only when they are deemed proportional and specific, subject to third-party court or tribunal review, and considerate of EU and member state legal interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal for the Data Act contains similar provisions – if no international agreement exists, the transfer “should only be allowed if it has been verified that the third country’s legal system requires the reasons and proportionality of the decision to be set out, that the court order or the decision is specific in character, and that the reasoned objection of the addressee is subject to a review by a competent court in the third country, which is empowered to take duly into account the relevant legal interests of the provider of such data” – and its recent revisions reportedly align language concerning international data transfers more closely with the DGA. These rules will complicate international transfers of nonpersonal data, as each request must undergo a review process by “competent authorities” designated by the member states to ensure that adequate safeguards for compliance with the DGA – and the Data Act once enacted – are in place. Potential conflicts between the CLOUD Act and the GDPR remain, and new legislation, such as the DGA and the Data Act, will further complicate the legal basis for nonpersonal data transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security-standards-for-cloud-service-providers&quot;&gt;Security Standards for Cloud Service Providers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European action is also focused on regulating cloud service providers with security requirements that include sovereignty provisions, and, in the case of France, forced technology transfer to local joint venture partners as a condition of market entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2021, the French National Cloud Strategy outlined the development of a “Cloud de confiance” label to further protect French data while enabling the use of innovative services. This label is based on the certification scheme SecNumCloud – a security standard for cloud service providers launched in 2016. The strategy outlined that the Cloud de confiance label would allow the creation of new cloud service companies with European ownership and foreign technology to ensure that cloud service providers operating in France provide both legal and technical protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France updated the sovereignty requirements in SecNumCloud in March 2022 following the strategy’s direction to focus on integrating protection criteria with respect to extra-European law. The provisions include joint ownership requirements to preclude majority foreign-owned providers from being SecNumCloud certified. Joint-ownership requirements similar to those used by China sparked a number of partnerships between French and U.S. companies to build joint cloud services with majority French ownership, such as between Google Cloud and Thales and between Capgemini, Orange, and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SecNumCloud contains provisions that go beyond cybersecurity requirements. Its considerations of foreign jurisdiction and control of data relate more to sovereignty than to cybersecurity. The updated SecNumCloud certification includes requirements for the “central administration or main establishment of the service provider” to be located in the European Union and localization requirements that the provider must store and process customer and technical data in the European Union. The SecNumCloud requirements have met with opposition from industry since they could impact security and raise costs. There are also concerns overs its localization requirements and immunity to extraterritorial legislation. Some analysts argue that SecNumCloud requirements “breach both France and the European Union’s (EU) commitments under the World Trade Organization’s General Agreement on Trade in Services.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) is also developing its certification scheme for cloud services (EUCS), as directed by Article 48 of the European Union’s Cybersecurity Act. The scheme is a cybersecurity certification system for cloud services with three assurance levels: basic, substantial, and high. The basic requirements are meant to define a minimum acceptable baseline for cloud cybersecurity; the substantial requirements are meant to define standards to mitigate against cyberattacks carried out by actors with limited skills and resources; and the high requirements are meant to define standards to mitigate against cyberattacks carried out by actors with significant skills and resources. In April 2022, the European Commission reportedly asked ENISA to include sovereignty requirements in the updated version of EUCS. The proposed sovereignty requirements would only apply to high level certifications. According to reporting on the draft requirements, the provider would have to be “headquartered in Europe, not be controlled by any non-EU entity,” and be “completely independent from non-EU laws.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although currently voluntary, the Directive on Measures for a High Common Level of Cybersecurity across the Union (NIS2 Directive), approved in November 2022, gives member states the ability to mandate compliance with EU certification standards, such as EUCS. The directive states that “in order to demonstrate compliance with certain requirements of Article 18, member states may require essential and important entities to certify certain ICT [information and communications technology] products, ICT services, and ICT processes under specific European cybersecurity certification schemes adopted pursuant to Article 49 of Regulation (EU) 2019/881.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drafting of EUCS has been criticized for a lack of transparency and accountability, and industry associations have raised concerns about the politization of the process in multiple joint memos. EUCS is also seen as problematic by European member states. Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden have raised concerns about the requirements. At the December 2022 TTC meeting, U.S. secretary of commerce Gina Raimondo offered the TTC as a potential avenue to present differing opinions over EUCS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ENISA will present an updated draft of the requirements to the European Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG) – a coalition of cybersecurity authorities in member states – which will then issue an opinion for ENISA’s consideration. The ECCG will then have three months to form a draft opinion, after which ENISA will have six months to present a final draft to the commission. EUCS is set to be implemented in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skepticism about these EU initiatives is driven in part by the fact that the location of data does not ensure the security of data. Best practices, such as the use of encryption, are what make data secure, regardless of where it is located. Inadequately secured data is vulnerable wherever it is located. Given the importance of the transatlantic relationship, further progress to bridge legal differences between the United States and the European Union should remain a priority on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concerns-over-european-action&quot;&gt;Concerns over European Action&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the European Union, there have been calls to discuss sovereignty requirements in cybersecurity certification schemes at the European Council level, rather than ENISA, to ensure adequate input from member states. Countries noted the political nature of these sovereignty requirements and requested increased transparency and conversation on the EUCS drafting process. Germany suggested these EUCS requirements be discussed through the European Council’s Horizontal Working Party on Cyber Issues or the Working Party on Telecommunications and Information Society. A recent document from member states explored alternative solutions to safeguard against the application of non-EU law in the context of EUCS, including more specific levels of assurances for critical uses and modifying pending EU legislation to discuss the issue at a political level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backlash from governments and industry is largely rooted in the potential damage from data localization requirements on innovation and security in the European Union. As U.S. companies account for 72 percent of the European cloud market, limiting Europe’s industry choice through these requirements will raise costs and create a gaps in capacity for European industry. The fate of Gaia-X, an initiative launched in 2020 to defend European interests and values in the cloud, suggests that both sides would benefit from a cooperative solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatives have been discussed to address European concerns about extraterritorial access to data. Companies in particular point to encryption over localization as the key protection for data. They have also accelerated partnerships with domestic providers to ensure local storage and compliance with country regulations. Google, for example, is specifically expanding their trusted partner cloud program to ensure collaboration with local providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data localization could limit access to cybersecurity resources, hinder incident response efforts, and create obstacles to information sharing. One of the first things Ukraine had to do in the face of Russian cyberattacks in 2022 was revoke its data localization rules and migrate data to the extraterritorially located cloud. There is a growing sense in Washington that digital sovereignty and cybersecurity are used as an excuse for protectionism (exacerbated by remarks from some senior European officials calling for an exclusion of U.S. cloud providers), but this is a dispute that can be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-ahead&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two principles that build on recent agreements can help guide transatlantic discussion to a mutually agreeable outcome:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-build-on-shared-values-established-in-the-oecd-declaration&quot;&gt;1. Build on shared values established in the OECD declaration.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the United States and European Union can build on the recent progress to build common understandings for sovereignty and for the requirements for streamlined access to digital evidence. There is an opportunity to build on the OECD’s Declaration on Government Access to Personal Data held by Private Sector Entities (agreed on in December 2022 after two years of negotiations). These joint principles apply to government activities, and for the United States, this includes requests made under the CLOUD Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The declaration marked the first intergovernmental agreement on “common approaches to safeguarding privacy and other human rights and freedoms when accessing personal data for national security and law enforcement purposes” and emphasized the countries’ “significant commonalities” on the topic. The principles include necessity, proportionality, transparency, oversight, and redress – areas that can be foundational in the creation of joint understandings between the United States and the European Union and a starting point for negotiations on a formal e-evidence agreement. These principles identify an emerging common language that can be built upon for a legally binding treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-use-the-eu-us-data-privacy-framework-as-a-model-for-joint-understandings&quot;&gt;2. Use the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework as a model for joint understandings.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent progress on the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework also points to joint understandings that can be key for the negotiation of an e-evidence agreement – the draft adequacy decision references U.S. criminal legal processes as providing adequate safeguards for European data. Prior to the implementation of these sovereignty requirements in the European Union, conversation with the United States on how to reach common ground will be key to EU innovation and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an open question as to whether pursuing CLOUD Act agreements with EU countries could be superseded by these agreements, and with the U.S.-EU discussion over data governance, there are encouraging signs. There are shared transatlantic concerns over crime and law enforcement which signal that agreement remains possible. The problem is not going away, and the outlines of a solution are visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 sent shockwaves around the world as states reacted to the return of high-intensity state-on-state conventional warfare on the European continent. Less attention has been paid to the unconventional aspects of this conflict – and yet, these are essential to understanding Russian actions and methods. The invasion itself can be seen as the intended culmination of a long unconventional campaign waged by Russia against Ukraine. The unconventional operations during the war have often been critical to Russia’s successive theories of victory, even as its conventional forces have failed to achieve their objectives on the battlefield. For those wishing to understand the Russian way of war and to learn lessons for their own defence, it is important to study this unconventional side of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unconventional warfare is defined for the purpose of this report as the conduct of covert and clandestine operations, psychological operations, subversion, sabotage, special operations and intelligence and counterintelligence activities aimed at contributing to a state’s military objectives. Describing these activities is complicated by the fact that Russian unconventional warfare fits within a distinct methodological tradition that uses precise but different terminology from other traditions. For example, in the US ‘unconventional warfare’ has a heavy weighting towards the sponsoring of non-state actors to overthrow a state. As shall be seen, the Russian attempt to subvert the Ukrainian state and thereby collapse resistance clearly fits within this concept of operations, but the combination of tools employed has a different weighting to what would normally be considered unconventional warfare. A consistent challenge in this special report is that Russian terminology for activities often has a very limited parallel in other traditions. On the whole – given that this is aimed at a NATO professional audience – this report uses British terms of art. Where it is necessary to use a specific Russian concept, this is explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report comprises two parts. The first spans Russia’s preparations and intentions as regards unconventional operations in Ukraine. It describes Russia’s agent network for conducting unconventional warfare in Ukraine, built up over many years, and then outlines how this network was intended to be used to enable the occupation and annexation of the country. The second part discusses how Russia used unconventional operations in light of how the war actually unfolded, including the counterintelligence regime on the occupied territories and the employment of special forces and irregular forces during the fighting. This report does not explore Russian operations in detail from 2014–21 but is instead focused on the build-up and execution of unconventional operations in support of the invasion in 2022. The aim is to detail Russia’s forms and methods, to enable them to be disrupted, and to provide an unclassified basis for discussing indicators, warnings and countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence from this report comes from extensive interviews – conducted both prior to and during the conflict – throughout Ukraine’s Intelligence Community, Security Services and Law Enforcement agencies. The report also draws on a large volume of material either captured on the battlefield in Ukraine or obtained elsewhere from Russia’s special services and the organisations and entities with which they interact. The evidence set deals with Russian activities observed between July 2021 and February 2023. Owing to the sensitivity of much of the evidence this report often necessarily extrapolates from incidents where it is possible to describe specific details to general patterns in Russian forms and methods. Where these extrapolations are made the authors have ensured that there is a consistent picture reported between Ukrainian agencies, available documentary evidence, and have in many instances checked the conclusions with non-Ukrainian agencies which are familiar with the forms and methods identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collection that targets organisations such as Russia’s special services is inherently fragmentary owing to the efforts these entities make to secure information on their activities. Writing about these subjects is further complicated by the sensitivities surrounding the evidence that has been collected and how it was obtained, which often prevents disclosure. The financial records of a front organisation for funding active measures, for example, may offer irrefutable evidence of an allegation that a body is funded by Russia’s special services. Declaring that such a document has been obtained, however, likely causes a change in funding arrangements disrupting future collection and will inevitably trigger an investigation by Russia’s special services into how such a document was obtained that may place a source at risk. A further methodological challenge is in being specific about the lessons to be drawn from a conflict. For instance, if a particular vulnerability is highlighted in Russian operations as implying a need to change the approaches of friendly services, this implies that friendly services adopt a similar form or use a similar method and potentially endangers their personnel. In navigating these dangers this report restricts its descriptions to general patterns and incidents rather than describing specific operations in detail. Where specific Russian activities are described, it is because it is deemed that the Russians know how such activities were identified. The report also focuses its analysis on the activities and vulnerabilities of the Russian conduct of unconventional warfare and does not describe how Russian successes or failures may require changes to the forms and methods of friendly services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this report is in places necessarily imprecise and far from comprehensive. Nevertheless, it is hoped that in outlining the scope and scale of Russia’s unconventional war against Ukraine, it will provide a useful resource for states that are targets of Russian unconventional operations to educate policymakers, strengthen societal resilience against Russian methods, disrupt Russian operations and prepare to deny the Russian special services opportunities in the event of hostilities. It is also hoped that understanding Russia’s unconventional operations will help to explain some of the more peculiar aspects of Russian decision-making and force employment of its conventional military during its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-the-theatre&quot;&gt;Setting the Theatre&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian plan for the occupation and annexation of Ukraine cannot be understood without appreciating the preconditions that Russia believed it had established through its protracted unconventional warfare against Kyiv. The strategy was premised on the orchestration of agents in place, built up over decades, but applied to a radically different policy from that for which most of Moscow’s assets had been recruited. As shall be detailed hereafter, Russia’s intended defeat mechanism was Ukraine’s internal destabilisation and disorganisation, which was supposed to disable the system of government and military command and control, undermine public trust in government institutions, reduce national stability and minimise aid to Ukraine from international partners. Under such conditions, the Russian military anticipated encountering little sustained or organised resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of proper logistics, the lack of fuel and ammunition, the vulnerability of long Russian convoys, poorly protected even from air raids, all indicate that Russia carried out the invasion as a military demonstration, without seriously considering the need to conduct full-fledged long-term combat operations. To a large extent, the small group of planners thought to repeat the success of the Crimean operation of 2014, which also made no sense from a military point of view and was planned based on the absence of military resistance from Ukraine. A vivid example of such neglect in February 2014 was the invasion of Ukrainian airspace by 11 Mi-24 combat helicopters and eight IL-76 military transport aircraft carrying Russian special forces to Crimea, which were not shot down by Ukrainian air defence only because the then leadership of the General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces refused to give an order. Russian attempts to land Russian airborne forces (VDV) on airfields near Kyiv in February 2022 fits perfectly into the same logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter, therefore, covers the structure of this agent network and how Russia intended to use it in the context of the full-scale invasion. Understanding why Russia thought it could succeed in this way is vital if such behaviour is to be deterred in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-agent-network&quot;&gt;Russia’s Agent Network&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FSB, which was deeply involved in the planning and execution of the invasion, appears to have been ordered to prepare plans to occupy Ukraine in July 2021. To do this the Fifth Service of the FSB took the 9th Section of the Department of Operational Information and turned it into a Directorate, increasing its staff from around two dozen personnel to over 200 reporting to Major General Igor Chumakov. The 9th Directorate was structured into oblast-facing sections along with thematic sections aimed at Ukraine’s parliament and another aimed at critical national infrastructure. The role of the Department for Operational Information is primarily planning, targeting and intelligence management: the assignment of priorities to handlers for their agents. The agents are not necessarily handled directly by the FSB Fifth Service. In the case of planning the occupation, therefore, the task of the 9th Directorate was not to establish and run an agent network, but rather to draw a detailed picture of the access achieved across Ukraine by Russia’s special services and then to plan how these existing agents were to be used during the invasion and subsequent occupation. Once this was done, it was necessary to provide instructions to agents’ established handlers as to what they were to ask their agents to do. This required meetings, and so in the autumn of 2021 Russian agents in Ukraine began to go on brief holidays at short notice to resorts in Turkey, Cyprus and Egypt where, coincidentally, they would meet with their handlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preferred method of Russia’s special services is – where possible – to minimise the running of agents from Russia and instead to recruit senior agents in place who run their own networks. The method of using such senior agents (agent-gruppovod) who build up client networks was highly recommended in Soviet classified manuals and instructions of the First Chief Directorate of the KGB (foreign intelligence service), and has remained the practice of the SVR, FSB Fifth Service and the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation – hereafter referred to as the GRU. If these individuals are politically, economically or bureaucratically senior in the target country, then they can recruit people not as Russian agents but as their personal clients who therefore unwittingly advance Russian interests. This is a form of false flag recruitment (verbovka na chuzhoi flag) where an agent may believe that they are being tasked on behalf of an official of their own country even though the taskings are ultimately contrived in Moscow. In the case of Ukraine, several senior officials and politicians performed this role – as shall be detailed shortly – having links with the Russian special services stretching decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internal destabilisation was attempted by agents of the Russian special services in Ukraine, including within the Ukrainian intelligence community, law enforcement agencies, other state authorities, political parties, public organisations and criminal organisations. Today, the Ukrainian intelligence community and its foreign partners have uncovered part of this agent network, which allows us to analyse the main tasks that the Russian leadership set for it, as well as to understand the main forms and methods it uses. At the same time, not all Russian agents and their operations have been exposed, and a significant part of Russia’s agents both in Ukraine and in other countries continue to actively operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andriy Derkach was a People’s Deputy in the Ukrainian Parliament with a long history of working with the Russians and advancing policies that aligned with Russian interests. He graduated from the Academy of the FSK (now FSB) in Moscow in 1993 before returning to Ukraine. His father was a senior KGB officer and for many years also head of Ukraine’s SBU. For several years Derkach headed Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear enterprise, during which time he signed several deals with Rosatom that created a dependency on the Russian nuclear industries. While this cannot be framed as espionage, the SBU was deeply concerned with his activities at that time and reported to then President Viktor Yushchenko about potential threats to Ukrainian national security. The head of Rosatom at that time was Sergei Kirienko, who is now first deputy head of the presidential administration of the Russian Federation and deeply involved in the coordination of Russian cross-government efforts on Ukraine’s occupied territories. It is believed by Ukraine’s intelligence community that influence on the Ukrainian nuclear energy industry in the interests of Russia and Rosatom was the main direction of Derkach’s pro-Russian activities before 2022. This would explain why Derkach is accused of being handled by Russia’s GRU, the primary responsibilities of which include the nuclear industry and Rosatom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s nuclear energy infrastructure played a significant role in Russia’s invasion plan and its public narratives about the conflict. As one of the justifications for aggression, the Kremlin publicly identified the threat that Ukraine plans to create its own nuclear weapons, and therefore one of the tasks of the Russian ‘special military operation’ was the denuclearisation of Ukraine, which included the intent to seize all nuclear power plants (NPPs), as well as some nuclear research centres. To prepare for these operations, the Russian special services recruited employees of nuclear facilities, including from units responsible for the physical security of the facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derkach’s first exposure as a Russian agent emerged when he participated in campaigns of covert influence aimed at undermining relations between Ukraine and the US. Thus, in 2019–20, Derkach made public several documents (most probably forged), as well as audio recordings of President Petro Poroshenko’s conversations with then US Vice-President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which suggested the presence of systematic US interference in the internal politics of Ukraine, and implied corrupt actions by high-ranking US officials in Ukraine. In 2020–21, the US Treasury Department imposed sanctions against Andriy Derkach for participating in a Russian foreign influence network, organising a disinformation campaign and meddling in US elections. According to the US government, at that time Derkach had been a Russian agent for over 10 years. In addition to Derkach, sanctions were also imposed on members of the Ukrainian parliament Oleksandr Dubinsky, Oleksandr Onishchenko, Prosecutor Kostyantyn Kulik, former Assistant to the Prosecutor General Andrii Telizhenko, and three other citizens of Ukraine. This group also tried to influence the US government. One of the tools of influence used for this purpose was an ‘anti-corruption group’ in the Ukrainian parliament, which was supposed to investigate the facts of corruption in the allocation of international aid to Ukraine. The ultimate goal of the anti-corruption investigation is believed to have been to stop or at least reduce international aid to Ukraine. Given Ukraine’s critical dependence on military-technical assistance from foreign partners, and above all assistance from the US, Russian special influence operations to worsen Ukraine’s relations with partner countries, and especially with the US, are a constant priority of the Russian special services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2022, the SBU made public the Derkach network, seizing a range of documents and outlining its assigned tasks. It appears that Derkach came under the control of the GRU in 2016 and was handled by General Vladimir Alekseev, the first deputy head of the service, and Admiral Igor Kostyukov, the head of the service. Derkach is alleged to have been tasked with the establishment of a network of private security firms which would assist in maintaining control in a number of towns by pathfinding and assisting Russian forces upon their arrival. For this purpose he is accused of receiving instalments of US$3–4 million per month from the GRU. Due to the need to preserve the secrecy of investigation, Ukrainian counterintelligence has not publicised additional information on what other functions Derkach had. At the same time it is clear that some of the most important Russian agents had close ties with Derkach and he could be directly involved in the recruitment of the most high-ranking Ukrainian officials in Russia’s agent network, in particular in the Ukrainian special services and parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, SBU Major General Oleg Kulinich, detained by counterintelligence in June 2022, also worked as Andriy Derkach’s deputy at Energoatom in the past and is a close friend of his family. Kulinich, who worked in the office of the Head of the Security Service of Ukraine, is accused of transferring data constituting a state secret to the Russian special services, exerting influence on the higher state leadership of Ukraine, recruiting other employees of the special services, as well as aiding the capture of the south of Ukraine, in particular by suppressing the information available in Ukrainian intelligence collection about the preparation of the invasion of the mainland from the Crimean peninsula. The main task of the Kulinich group was to weaken the national security system, in particular, the ability of counterintelligence to effectively detect Russian agents and to mislead the top military and political leadership of Ukraine about the true state of internal and external threats, the collection and transmission of information to the Russian special services about the defence system of southern Ukraine, the location of military objects, and personal data of employees of the Ukrainian special services and members of their families, as well as undercover agents and assets of the Ukrainian special services that operated in the occupied territories and the territory of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of his tasks, Kulinich is alleged to have exerted influence on behalf of Russia to shape the adoption of personnel and management decisions in the SBU system and other state authorities of Ukraine. In particular, thanks to his influence, Brigadier General Andrii Naumov, who is also accused of treason, was appointed to the position of head of the Main Directorate of Internal Security of the SBU (which supervises all SBU employees and can carry out surveillance, wiretapping and other special measures against SBU officers as part of its investigations). It is noteworthy that, among other things, Ukrainian law enforcement agencies accuse General Naumov of passing on secret information about the security system of the Chornobyl NPP to the Russian special services, where Naumov worked in the management for a long time. This information was used by the Russian troops during the seizure of the Chornobyl NPP and when using the Chornobyl disaster exclusion zone to launch an attack on Kyiv. Using his influence, Kulinich tried to secure the appointment of Naumov to the post of First Deputy Head of the SBU. One of the motives was to take control of the Counterintelligence Department of the SBU. Naumov left Ukraine a few hours before the Russian invasion and was detained in June 2022 in Serbia while crossing the border for the undeclared importation of a large amount of cash. According to the investigation, Kulinich was in contact with ex-Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine and ex-Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Volodymyr Sivkovich (a former KGB employee who is under US sanctions), who fled Ukraine after the Revolution of Dignity and permanently lives in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the other tasks that Major General Kulinich is alleged to have received from the FSB through Sivkovich was to exert influence on the higher political leadership of Ukraine to convince it of the need to abandon the course of joining NATO and to adopt a neutral status just prior to the invasion. Refusal to join NATO, according to the Russian special services’ plan, along with other Ukrainian concessions to Russia, should have been the impetus for anti-government protests, similar to the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, when President Yanukovych refused to integrate Ukraine into the EU. Mass protests were intended to simplify the task of the Russian special services to destabilise Ukraine internally and paralyse the system of state and military administration, providing the conditions for a Russian military invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task of setting the conditions for violent protest was exposed when, in January 2022, the Ministry of Internal Affairs arrested Colonel Yuriy Goluban of the Ukrainian National Police, formerly a member of the SBU’s Alpha unit, responsible for direct action. While serving in the Donetsk branch of SBU Alpha in 2014, Goluban had joined a pro-Russian militia, as part of the command of the Donetsk People’s Republic’s battalion ‘Vostok’. However, he successfully concealed these activities and later returned to Ukraine, joining the national police. Prior to the invasion, Ukrainian law enforcement accuses him of receiving money to organise protests in Kyiv and three other oblasts at which extreme right-wing symbols would be prevalent and in which the protesters would accuse the government of failing to confront the threat from Russia. The intent was to infiltrate these protests with paid criminals and agent provocateurs to spark violent confrontations with the police. The original idea was to present the protests as an attempted ‘far-right coup’ and to use them as a justification for the invasion. It was also intended to sow internal instability among the Ukrainian resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Russians were setting the conditions for street violence and internal destabilisation under an openly pro-Russia flag, in a manner consistent with their preferred approach of supporting extremes against the centre to drive polarisation and therefore control. This activity is alleged to have been orchestrated by a group around Viktor Medvechuk, leader of the OPZZH Party, and fellow members of parliament including Viktor Chornyi and Ilya Kiva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before joining the pro-Russia camp in 2019, Kiva pretended to be a radical Ukrainian nationalist known for his aggressive Russophobia. Immediately after the Revolution of Dignity, Kiva joined the leadership of the paramilitary organisation Right Sector, and soon after joined the National Police of Ukraine, where he headed the Department of Anti-Drug Trafficking, as well as the trade union of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In 2020, as part of Medvedchuk’s group, he created and headed the organisation Patriots for Life, which consisted mostly of representatives of martial arts clubs, criminals (including drug dealers) and former employees of special police units (including those who were dismissed for crimes during the Revolution of Dignity). The basis of the organisation was the representatives of the Combat Sambo Federation of Ukraine, the martial art of Soviet special bodies, whose honorary president was Viktor Medvedchuk himself. The task of the organisation is believed to have been to create provocations during mass events, as well as to radicalise the socio-political situation in Ukraine, including by provoking a violent confrontation with representatives of pro-Ukrainian organisations. After the Russian invasion of 2022, members of the organisation moved to illegal status and performed various tasks for the Russian special services in support of the Russian invasion. A similar model was also used by the Russians before the 2014 aggression, when the Oplot organisation, which also consisted of a mixture of athletes, criminals and law enforcement officers, was first used for violence against opponents of the Yanukovych regime, and later became the basis for the formation of Russian proxy forces in Donetsk. As with Derkach, Medvedchuk’s group also controlled security firms and detective agencies. Member of parliament Viktor Chornyi was responsible for this direction in the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Naumov was travelling with a renowned smuggler when he was arrested crossing the Serbian border speaks to a much wider phenomenon in Russia’s agent networks in Ukraine. Beneath the senior agents in the Ukrainian government there was a large support apparatus. This apparatus has been used for a wide range of functions, from reconnaissance to basic movement of cash, equipment, or the setting up of safe houses. In some cases, this includes Ukrainian citizens who have a loyalty to Russia. In many cases, however, the individuals in question are paid agents drawn from organised criminal networks. For years prior to the full-scale invasion, the Ukrainian Border Guard Service noted close relationships between Russian officers and smuggler networks across all of Ukraine’s borders. Often, however, the support apparatus did not need to conduct such covert activity. The movement of cash, for example, was easily facilitated either through the diplomatic bag of Russia’s allies before the invasion, or simply through the large number of companies owned by Russian agents in Ukraine, some of whose workers could set up channels for siphoning money to operations. It is important to note that while the support apparatus was less important for Russia’s invasion plans, it persists and is a critical enabler of ongoing Russian activity on Ukrainian territory. The one body of ideologically committed agents supporting the invasion was the Russian Orthodox Church. Beyond its efforts to support Russian information operations, its priests were widely recruited and run by the Russian special services and their monasteries and churches used as safe houses for equipment and personnel. The use of religion as cover is not only a widely established method of the Russian special services but also creates its own protection mechanism because of the political sensitivities of state targeting of religious institutions. For this reason, it took some time for the Ukrainian state to move to constrain the activities of these parts of Russia’s support apparatus even after the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These various strands of effort were coordinated by Volodymyr Sivkovich, the former deputy head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, who fled to Russia in 2014. On 20 January 2022, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken specifically singled out Sivkovich as central to FSB plans to handle senior Ukrainian agents. Sivkovich appears to have functioned as the handler for these senior Ukrainian officials reporting directly to Igor Chumakov in the 9th Directorate of the FSB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assessing-the-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-the-network&quot;&gt;Assessing the Strengths and Weaknesses of the Network&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the extent of Russia’s efforts – only a fraction of which are outlined above – it is noteworthy that Russia failed to bring about the destabilisation its plan called for. Even with the presence of powerful agents in state authorities, as well as prepared structures that could be involved in internal destabilisation, Russia has not managed to foment an internal political crisis in Ukraine. First, it was not possible to achieve the main prerequisites for full-scale protests. Despite pressure and influence, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not agree to renounce Ukraine’s bid for membership of NATO and make other concessions to Russia unacceptable to the majority of Ukrainians. Second, as part of intelligence sharing, Western intelligence services transmitted to Ukraine not only information about Russia’s preparations for a military invasion, but also about Russian intentions to destabilise Ukraine internally, as well as about persons who directly participated in it. Public release of information about such intentions was also an important element of neutralising Russian efforts. Nevertheless, despite senior Russian intelligence officials recommending the invasion be delayed until the summer of 2022 because the necessary conditions were not met, Moscow proceeded with its invasion. Russia’s belief that it understood Ukrainian politics may have been bolstered by the number of senior former Ukrainian officials resident in Moscow who had a clear motive in telling the Kremlin to proceed. According to information held by the SBU, the following representatives of the Yanukovych regime also cooperate with the Russian special services on a regular basis: ex-Minister of Defence Pavlo Lebedev; ex-head of the SBU Oleksandr Yakymenko; ex-Minister of Internal Affairs Vitaly Zakharchenko; and Andriy Klyuev, ex-head of the Presidential Administration. During the years working in the Ukrainian government, such persons had practically unlimited opportunity to infiltrate their own agents in all state bodies and to extract whatever information interested them. Nevertheless, Moscow’s decision to proceed without the necessary preconditions suggests two things: first, that Russia’s agents were exaggerating their influence on the Ukrainian state; and, second, that the Russian special services had been ordered to facilitate an occupation to a timeline, not to assess its viability. In other words, that the next phase of Russia’s plan proceeded even though the previous phase had not yet succeeded speaks to a command-driven process from the top and an institutional culture of following orders rather than the provision of honest advice from Russia’s special services to the executive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, until the last moment before the invasion, the Russian agents were preparing for the organisation of internal destabilisation, and the structures they created in Ukraine for this purpose were practically unprepared and unsuitable for use in the conditions of a long-term, full-scale military conflict – for example, as sabotage groups that could operate in the deep. Moreover, Russian military aggression and crimes against the civilian population have changed the attitude towards Russia not only among ordinary Ukrainians, but also among representatives of pro-Russian organisations. Even in the case of the Patriots for Life organisation, some members publicly condemned Russian aggression. Similar processes took place in 2014, when veteran structures created in Ukraine by the GRU (mostly along the lines of Dmitriy Sablin’s organisation ‘Boevoe bratstvo’) and the FSB (such as organisations of KGB special forces and organisations of Afghanistan veterans) after the start of the military conflict mostly remained loyal to Ukraine and even joined the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians recruited penetrations of the Ukrainian state at a senior level across its institutions. These penetrations were able to mobilise large numbers of subordinates to follow their instructions without necessarily knowing that they were working to further Russian interests. The networks centred on a core nucleus of senior officials who had interlinked histories and were mutually supporting. Yet, despite these successes, the FSB’s plans failed and it is important to understand why. Many had anticipated that the Ukrainian state would fragment from within. This did not happen, and many of these networks were disrupted or had key members detained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few observations about the Russian forms and methods employed reveals the strengths and vulnerabilities of their approach. It is likely that even these senior agents knew relatively little about the overall invasion plan, which was kept to a very small group of planners. While they may have surmised the overall thrust from what they were asked to do, it is not evident that they were read in. Most individuals who these principal agents controlled would have known much less. Prior to the invasion, it may be argued that the Russians maintained an extensive and robust network in Ukraine. Many conducting supportive tasks for the Russian special services would have thought they were following the instructions of a Ukrainian official. Those conducting illegal activities on behalf of Russian agents were often doing so under financial incentives. But the risk – hypothetically – for an employee of the national police in providing information to a Ukrainian official in another government department for a fee would be negligible and the financial reward potentially welcome. The problem for the Russians was that, first, the full-scale invasion fundamentally altered the context within which their unwitting agents, or agents recruited under false flags who lacked any ideological commitment to their cause, were judging the harms of operating under Russian control. The same police officer, for example, appreciating that the information they were asked to provide may be used to guide Russian tanks into Ukraine’s cities, may be less willing to have anything to do with the Russians and may see the risks of discovery as greater than the reward of some money. A criminal who previously saw little harm in acting as a courier across the Russo-Ukrainian border may nevertheless feel that they must protect their family if it is coming under air attack. Many of the networks therefore became unreliable in the early days of the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unreliability of the networks would likely have mattered much less if the Russian military had secured its immediate objectives. In a scenario where the Russian military was in control of Ukrainian cities and Russia’s principal agents were issued clear instructions for their networks, it is likely that the risk–reward calculus would have seen significant levels of collaboration achieved. Instead, as Russian troops failed to take their objectives, many networks either froze in place to be activated later or dissolved, as members of the network lost any incentive to work with Russia and broke contact with their handlers. Many agents remained in place, enabling reconnaissance, but could offer little by way of disruption. Most of the FSB’s planning had been premised on physically controlling the terrain and there was a lack of command and control for the unwitting agents recruited previously in a scenario where the FSB did not have a physical presence on the ground. However, while the Russian plan unravelled, it was not entirely flawed. In the areas where the Russians did occupy the ground, they demonstrated that they could build up a sufficient body of collaborators to exert control and run a robust counterintelligence apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-plan-of-activation&quot;&gt;The Plan of Activation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before detailing how Russia ended up using its agent network it is important to understand how it was intended to support the occupation of Ukraine. This is vital because, even though it differs from how events actually unfolded, the Russian invasion plan does not make sense without understanding Moscow’s intended defeat mechanism of the Ukrainian state. The difficulties experienced by the Russian military therefore cannot be understood without appreciating what Russian planners expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 24 February 2022, when Russian forces moved over the border, troops of the Eastern Military District confronted a detachment of Ukraine’s national guard responsible for securing the Chornobyl NPP. Seeking instructions, the detachment contacted Valentin Vitter, head of the plant’s security, who advised them to surrender – both to save their own lives given the disparity in force between them and the Russians, and to prevent damage to the facility. The plant was seized within two hours without a fight. This was not an isolated incident but recurred throughout southern Ukraine in the first days of the war. A similar process was also simultaneously attempted across the entire Ukrainian government, but to less effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the opening hours of the invasion, senior Russian officials phoned their Ukrainian counterparts to urge passivity to avoid bloodshed. Dmitry Kozak, for example, deputy chief of staff of the Russian Presidential Administration and head of the Committee for Transborder Cooperation intimately involved in the build-up of agent networks in Ukraine, phoned the Ukrainian Presidential Administration and urged surrender. On 25 February 2022, Putin publicly appealed to the Ukrainian military not to resist the Russian invasion, and instead to conduct a mutiny, to negotiate an end to the war with Russia. On 26 February, the Belarusian defence minister phoned his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksiy Reznikov, and conveyed a Russian offer to accept Ukraine’s surrender from Sergei Shoigu. On 22 February, the Belarusian defence minister had been involved in Russia’s wider attempt to deceive the Ukrainian government as to its intentions, personally assuring Reznikov that he would not allow an invasion to proceed from Belarusian territory. Over the first three days of the invasion, all of Ukraine’s General Officers received text messages or phone calls, often from counterparts on the Russian side whom they knew personally, to urge their inactivity to prevent bloodshed. Ukrainian officers at the rank of colonel meanwhile almost all received text messages urging inactivity or surrender, though these did not originate from known contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reporting about this outreach has often suggested that this Russian activity was supposed to bring about surrender of the higher levels of the Ukrainian state. This is to misunderstand the defeat mechanism. While a total surrender of Ukraine would have been desirable, the actual process by which the Russians anticipated occupation of the country was premised on the paralysis of the central Ukrainian apparatus combined with localised surrender of isolated Ukrainian units. The Russians mistakenly appear to have projected on to Ukraine the same top-down command culture of their own forces. A large portion of the middle echelon of officials that were Russian agents simply stopped responding to messages early in the invasion or else abandoned their posts, severing chains of command from the central government to tactical units. The advocacy towards Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to leave Kyiv and a wide range of other proposals that emerged from the bureaucracy were largely aimed at imposing decision paralysis on the centre. Meanwhile, Russia’s agents tried to convince local commanders and officials not to resist. They did not do this by presenting themselves as speaking on behalf of the Russians, but instead cited the local disparity in forces and the desire to save Ukrainian lives. The aim was to slow down a decision to resist for long enough to allow Russian forces to occupy key strategic centres. Resistance in this framework would be sporadic and isolated. In this context, the model for the wider Russian invasion plan may be observed in southern Ukraine – where it proved much more successful. Furthermore, since the task of Russia’s agents was to isolate Ukrainian units through obstruction and encourage junior paralysis and surrender, many of them withdrew their work from the government rather than actively operating to participate in the occupation. The intent was that they would emerge once the territory was occupied, rather than engage in some sort of coup or direct action before occupation was achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, that most Russian efforts were aimed at fixing and fragmenting resistance can be seen in the use of information and cyber attacks in the first days of the war. Rather than target critical national infrastructure or seek to inflict direct damage on Ukrainian systems – which was attempted later – the initial cyber attacks were largely aimed at communications systems that the Ukrainian state relied on. On the whole, they were unsuccessful because of the preparations made by the Ukrainian State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection. However, an example of a successful attack was against the company Viasat, which disrupted communications on the first day of the invasion, and highlights the primary object of much of these activities. The Russians were also partially successful in terms of information warfare, isolating Ukrainian communities through the release of misleading narratives aimed towards the mobilised civilians who the Ukrainian state armed to secure rear areas. These narratives emphasised the prevalence of sabotage groups and infiltrators: for example, the Russians started messages on Ukrainian social media calling for citizens to report suspicious markings on buildings. The result was a deluge of false positives swamping the capacity of Ukrainian law enforcement. This mirrored a persistent tactic from before the war whereby the Russian special services would make continual false bomb threats to Ukrainian law enforcement. Another consequence of amplifying paranoia was to instil fear into Territorial Defence Detachments and encourage incidents of friendly fire or at the very least slow down the movement of Ukrainian troops and officials through checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final critical element is that the one part of the Russian invasion plan where obstruction, isolation and negotiated capitulation could not be achieved in theory was Ukraine’s air defence system. Given the importance of projecting resupply and reinforcements by air into Ukraine, this had to be suppressed. Moreover, the striking of air defences and industry had a shock and awe value intended to encourage passivity. Thus, the one overtly planned conventional military component of the Russian campaign was the suppression and destruction of Ukraine’s air defences by the VKS and through a massive missile strike campaign using cruise and ballistic missiles. In the south, where older Ukrainian air defence systems were less mobile, this was largely successful. Elsewhere the Russians achieved the suppression and displacement of the air defences for several hours and, in some directions, it lasted for around 24 hours. Generally, however, the lack of appropriate training and equipment for this mission in the VKS meant that this effort failed and Ukrainian air defences recovered over the following two days. Given that Russia’s ground forces were intended to have occupied most of their key objectives within 72 hours, however, this would have been less problematic if the ground forces had not failed utterly to bypass or fight through Ukrainian troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the foremost causes of inaccuracy in pre-war military assessments of the likely trajectory of the fighting – both in NATO countries and in the Ukrainian military – stems from the assumption that the Russian forces would conduct a deliberate military offensive. For example, it was assumed that rail and logistics infrastructure would be targeted. Instead, because the aim was to fix and isolate Ukrainian units, there was very little attempt to destroy them in the first three days. The whole logic of the employment of forces was premised on the success of Russia’s unconventional operations and yet, as already discussed, the preconditions for that success in terms of the political destabilisation of Ukraine had not yet been achieved. There remains an unanswered question as to why the Russian leadership decided to begin the invasion without establishing the required preconditions. This may be understood as a strategic error of judgement by Putin personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk of Russia’s planning focused on what to do after the invasion. The details of the counterintelligence regime on the occupied territories is covered in the next section as these were observable in operation in those areas that were captured. Nevertheless, there was an element of the occupation plan that did not come to pass – the occupation of Kyiv – which also includes the intended use of special forces in the original invasion plan. As already outlined, the Russians intended to occupy Kyiv within 72 hours. The intent was for initial units to secure the main routes into the city and for airborne troops to then be flown to Hostomel airfield and to move to secure key zones within the city. Within each city sector these forces would provide cordons to control the movement of the population. The conventional Russian forces would then transition to screening and isolating the city, controlling the countryside and preventing reinfiltration by Ukrainian conventional detachments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind these troops were to come Russian Special Forces (SSO) and troops intended for repressive operations including the Rosgvardia – and in particular the Chechen Rosgvardia (Kadyrovtsy). The assignment of these troops to key roles on seized territory explains the relatively small level of infiltration and sabotage against military sites attempted in the opening phase of the conflict, which was anticipated as a standard element of Russian doctrine practised extensively in previous conflicts. Instead, most Spetsnaz deployed in conventional reconnaissance roles ahead of the battalion tactical groups, while special forces were largely intended to sweep in behind. The Russians were so confident that they would succeed in hours that their support apparatus had rented apartments around the key sites from which their special forces were supposed to operate in Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in Kyiv, the plan included three interconnected directions of operation. The first was the use of local agents to guide Russian SSO in capturing the executive and parliamentary leadership of the country. These were likely to be given show trials. Separately, the Kadyrovtsy were to engage in the hunting down of the Ukrainians believed to be organisers of patriotic resistance and those associated with the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. This was anticipated to be a dirty war, comparable to the conflict with the Chechen rebels following the fall of Grozny in 2000. The third line of effort was to be the pacification of the population. This depended on the isolation of communities through the control of egress and ingress through natural choke points in civic infrastructure. Within these isolated areas, the Rosgvardia were to manage protests and acts of civil resistance. There would not necessarily need to be violent suppression of protests, but the organisers of such protests could be identified and subsequently targeted by the Kadyrovtsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further task for SSO and VDV units was the seizure of Ukraine’s central bank, water and utilities, and the parliament. The intent was to allow Viktor Medvedchuk and other members of the Russian-aligned faction within the Ukrainian parliament to establish a movement for peace, to pass resolutions urging surrender to save lives and to save Ukraine, and thereafter to govern through the national parliament and through the regional parliaments and local administrations. The withdrawal of power, utilities and finance from regions that were considered problematic would be used to try and further isolate areas of persistent instability. Within this context, the foremost advocates for peace and therefore candidates for local government office throughout the country would be those officials who were part of the agent network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems with this plan are succinctly summarised by Lieutenant General Reshetnikov of the SVR, who observed that ‘the miscalculations were mostly political, as well as military: underestimation of the enemy, misunderstanding of the mood and functioning of this territory. There were, most likely, unjustified hopes. We were going to enter Kyiv, Kharkov, to bring to power reasonable representatives of the Ukrainian state. But what happened, happened’. The following chapter concerns what happened in those areas that the Russians succeeded in occupying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-unconventional-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;The Unconventional War in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having considered Russia’s preparations, the extent of its capabilities in Ukraine, and how it had conceptualised employing them, it is now possible to outline how these plans unfolded in practice and what can be learned about the forms and methods of the Russian special services when operating in the context of a large-scale conventional conflict. This should be considered in three parts: the functioning of the counterintelligence regime on the occupied territories; the use of special operations forces and irregular troops in combat; and the collection, analysis and dissemination of combat-relevant intelligence. This chapter will explore each of these topics in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-counterintelligence-regime-on-the-occupied-territories&quot;&gt;The Counterintelligence Regime on the Occupied Territories&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians implemented their occupation plan in the areas that they seized, allowing for the details of how it functioned in practice and its effectiveness to be studied. For each of the oblasts targeted for occupation, the FSB formed Temporary Operational Groups (TOGs) tasked with coordinating the occupation regime and its counterintelligence apparatus. Each TOG was commanded by an officer from the 9th Directorate of the Department of Operational Information of the FSB Fifth Service. The individual would usually be drawn from the section that had been tasked with targeting the oblast that they were to administer. In Ukraine these individuals operated under false names, which were usually generic. They would usually have a pair of deputies from the Fifth Service and beneath this core command group representatives from the other FSB services including counterintelligence, military counterintelligence and the FSB service responsible for the protection of infrastructure. They would also have a support staff. Each TOG was assigned detachments of Rosgvardia for cordoning and public order, Alpha detachments and other special forces troops for conducting raids, and troops including Chechen Rosgvardia detachments intended to conduct the elimination of high-value targets. This was a model that had been employed in and refined since the Second Chechen War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach to establishing the occupation administration was systematic. In the first instance, Russian forces were tasked with seizing all forms of records. This included public health, education, housing, tax, police, electoral and local government records. One of the first acts upon seizing the Chornobyl and Zaporizhzhia NPPs was the seizing of all hard drives from these sites. It also included private records from utility companies, insurance providers and NGOs. This data would be used to build a map of who was supposed to live where, who they were related to and whether they had any connections with the Ukrainian state. The population was divided into five core categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those deemed leaders of Ukrainian nationalism who were specified for physical liquidation on a high-priority target list, or for capture to enable show trials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those suspected of intending to support acts of resistance who needed to be recruited or suppressed including anyone associated with Ukrainian law enforcement, local government, the military or related to officials that were not actively collaborating.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those who were deemed apathetic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those actively collaborating with Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Individuals who were necessary for running critical national infrastructure and had to be controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within each town the TOG would appoint a garrison commander from the Russian military who would have an assigned detachment of garrison troops. These troops would occupy a building – usually the police or fire station – and set up facilities for detention, processing, interrogation and torture. The fact that the layout of these facilities is consistent throughout the country, and the equipment used in torture chambers, including specialised electrocution machines, were the same across multiple oblasts demonstrates that this was a systematic plan and not improvised sadism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the occupied areas different parts of the counterintelligence apparatus would begin to carry out their assigned tasks. Civic leaders including the owners of public utilities, schools and factories would be summoned to meet with a representative from the TOG and told that they must either collaborate in continuing to discharge their duties while reporting to the TOG or, in the case of educational institutions, enforcing curriculum changes, or they must resign. Among teachers in particular, if a school head was removed, the position was often offered to other staff if they were prepared to collaborate. If no collaborators could be found or the loyalty of a collaborator was suspected then these staff were usually replaced by a Russian who, in the case of public utilities, was usually an FSB officer from the service responsible for the protection of infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another part of the occupation administration was the information isolation of the communities being targeted. This was done in three ways. First, the Russian military would jam the frequencies by which people in the occupied area could access Ukrainian television and radio. Second, the telecommunications infrastructure was severed from Ukrainian infrastructure and reconnected to Russian infrastructure, enabling monitoring of telecommunication and internet traffic. Third, listening posts and metadata analysis against cellular telephones was set up to monitor the communications of local residents, prioritising those who attempted to route calls or messages from the occupied territories to the rest of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, garrisons were tasked with conducting house-to-house sweeps. This involved military units inspecting houses to confirm that the records seized accurately recorded who was at each address. They also searched homes for insignia, medals or uniforms indicating whether residents had previously had connections with the Ukrainian state and examined photographs and other personal effects to confirm the relationships between residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The occupation administrations and garrisons were aided in their activities by members of local law enforcement and civil servants recruited before the war as agents of the Russian special services. It is important to note that some pre-war assessments anticipated that these individuals would essentially seize local governments and thereafter hand them over to the Russians. In practice, there were far fewer recruited agents, and these were much too junior to bring about such an effect in most towns. Of the 800 Russian agents identified in the occupied parts of Kharkiv oblast, for example, the majority were junior officials in local government including in departments such as the forestry commission. Fewer than 100 local law enforcement officers collaborated. The Russians did not expect these individuals to simply continue running the oblast. Instead, they provided a network of informants and enablers who could perform several important functions. First, they had alerted the Russians to where repositories of documents were and could provide vital local knowledge about the community and its environs. Second, by reporting on the conduct of officials who had remained in place but were not directly collaborating, they could flag to the occupation authorities those who were apathetic as compared to those who might be actively working with the Ukrainian state or with resistance networks. A head teacher who said they would teach the new modules supplied by the TOG, for example, would be reported by a recruited agent in the school if they did not comply. In practice – as in the previously occupied areas of Crimea, and Luhansk and Donetsk – collaborators were a relatively small group but played an enabling role. The important point is that the FSB did not expect or require as part of its planning that the majority – or even a significant part of the population – welcomes it. Based on its experiences in Chechnya, the planning assumption was that 8% of the population needed to collaborate, whether proactively or under coercion, to enable the counterintelligence regime to be effective. The Ukrainian intelligence community, based on assessments of those areas where the Russians did establish control, concluded that the FSB was broadly correct in its requirements for local support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control through such a small part of the population could be asserted through violence. It is important to understand how violence was used, as it was applied differently to different targets. First, for those on the high-priority target list identified as Ukrainian nationalists the intent was to kill or capture them – spearheaded by Chechen units and the FSB. Because the Russians did not overrun Kyiv, Odesa, central Kharkiv and other major cities, most of the individuals on this list were beyond Russia’s reach and have remained so throughout the war, reducing the prominence of these activities. For those in senior positions or responsible for critical national infrastructure who were not active collaborators, the Russians worked to build leverage over them. In most cases this was first achieved through direct intimidation. Mayors, for example, were often taken in for questioning and received beatings, only to be released. Additionally, many persons in this category had members of their family detained and tortured. It was usually made clear to the person who was a target for leverage that other members of their family could also be detained, or the detained family members tortured further, if they did not comply with Russian instructions. This was also done by targeting Ukrainian officials within Ukrainian-controlled territory who had family members on the occupied territories. Generally speaking, the purpose of torture was to build leverage, evident from both the communications sent by the TOG to the target and as the victim was not subjected to questioning during or after their torture, but was simply tortured and then released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those suspected of being involved or likely to become involved in resistance, the process was more protracted and the outcome more varied. Those with ties to the Ukrainian state were detained and went through a process of filtration. This would usually begin with interrogation. Occasionally initial interrogations would involve violence and in a majority of cases there was a threat of escalation if the individuals were subsequently found to be conspiring against the occupation administration. Initial interrogation questions appear to have been formulaic and basic. Nevertheless, by building a picture of backgrounds, the FSB was laying the groundwork for network analysis. For individuals of concern the interrogation process was often escalated with a second round, sometimes conducted under torture. Here, the interrogators made use of the electrocution equipment established in the detention facilities and the questions would move from basic formulas to a more detailed examination of the individual. Some would be released after this process; others would be moved to facilities elsewhere, or in Russia itself, for further rounds of interrogation. Part of the logic of this displacement was that, if suspects were released after being displaced, they would have been separated from their friends and family. Thus, when they returned, it would be unclear to Ukrainian resistance networks whether they had been doubled and were now informing. A condition of release was often the provision of routine reports to the FSB. Moreover, their support network and contacts could thereby be examined as they invariably made contact with their closer friends upon their return to try and seek assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of filtration bore a remarkable resemblance to activities carried out under the Russian Ministry of Interior’s Directive 247 of 1994, a legally non-binding administrative decree issued during the First Chechen War which authorised the military to set up filtration points. Those passing through initial rounds of filtration would be documented and returned to their communities. Those deemed concerning could be detained and removed to filtration camps for further questioning and, in this process, separated from their families and support networks. Underpinning this system of repression in Ukraine was data. At the garrison level, most interrogation records and data were either held in separate databases or else were on paper or on laptops. They were not integrated datasets. Over time, however, as these case files on individuals expanded and as people were moved for interrogation, these files became more complex. Detainees describe how by their third interrogation it was evident that the questioning had shifted from formulaic questions, in the first round, to case-specific questions in the second round, and then questions that cross referenced with other’s case files by the third round. This cross referencing demonstrates that a counterintelligence indexing system was being used to build a network map of the population, allowing for interrogations to be crosschecked for consistency. By the time these datasets reached the TOG at the oblast level, there is evidence that data was ingested into ‘Spectrum’. Spectrum is the FSB’s digital architecture for its security and counterintelligence work on Russian territory. It ingests data from other Russian government bodies such as tax and court records, and police and border guards reports, as well as from other FSB systems such as ‘Magistral’, designed to harvest flight and shipping manifests, and SORM – the System for Operative Investigative Activities. Other sources of information include ‘PSKOV’, used for mobile phone tracking, billing and social media monitoring and ‘Sherlock’, an all-source database, including social media, mobile phone data and finances, which fuses various streams of government, commercially available and stolen data. Spectrum is essentially an app that functions as a portal to access several databases hosted on a range of commercially derived systems. Using Spectrum also allowed all FSB officers with the right permissions to draw on these interrogation reports and case files as the individuals moved around Russian-occupied territory or Russian territory. Thus, whereas when a suspect was detained their case file had to physically follow them, to be held by the detaining officers, the digitisation of the records ensured that the case files would always be available to FSB officers if an individual came to its attention again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the campaign of intimidation and suppression was collective punishment. In many towns occupied by Russian forces, local citizens either filmed them and uploaded the videos on to social media or else passed details about Russian troop movements to friends, family and the Ukrainian state. This was collected by the Ukrainian military and used for artillery targeting. In response, Russian troops conducted sweeps of all residents and examined their phones to establish whether they were sharing information with the Ukrainian military. If they were, then these individuals were detained and interrogated, often tortured, and in many cases executed. It is also important to note that Russian troops tasked with this were often scared and not especially thorough in their checks, preferring to detain on suspicion rather than on the discovery of proof. Many innocent civilians were therefore detained, tortured and murdered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brutality of Russian troops was not confined to those areas where there were ongoing Ukrainian artillery strikes. Even in those areas where no strikes were taking place, acts of resistance would often lead to apparently random people being lifted for interrogation in numbers. In some communities this essentially led many residents not to go out except for essentials. Given that this pattern was repeated in many towns, it seems systematic and to follow a cruel logic that, if acts of resistance bring about collective punishment, then those wishing to resist must not only factor in the risk to themselves but also the risk to their families, friends and community. The collapse in local businesses, social spaces and community also has a secondary effect. In towns where repression fractured normal life, the Russian occupation administration came to control shops, food distribution and services. Access to these things could be controlled, creating another coercive lever to not only suppress opposition but also to encourage collaboration. Fracturing a community enabled calculations of self-interest to force the local population to interact with, depend on and enable against its will the perpetuation of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These processes – integrating data from the occupied territories into the systems supporting Russian domestic repression, and displacing people into Russia itself – are consistent with Russia’s intent to eventually annex the occupied territory. The process of annexation was to be the same as had been applied to Crimea. First, a proportion of the population would be recruited or coerced into collaborating in the running of the local administration. Second, the area would be secured from military threats by the Russian military and from resistance activities by the harsh repressive measures. Third, this security would enable the wider elements of the FSB and Russian state apparatus to move on to the territory including law enforcement. Fourth, the collaborators in the local administration would be appointed to positions in rural and dispersed parts of Russia and replaced with Russians to directly administer the territory. Finally, the territory would be annexed. This process was not fully implemented because of the poor progress of the Russian military but did begin to be put into effect in Mariupol and other towns out of range of Ukrainian indirect fire. Beyond this point it was assessed that while resistance and sporadic insurgency might continue – as in Chechnya – it would not pose a threat to Russian control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-irregulars&quot;&gt;The Irregulars&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the invasion, the expectation was that Russia’s special forces would be employed in the conduct of strategic reconnaissance and special reconnaissance actions. As outlined, most of the relevant troops were instead held back to support the occupation administrations. When the occupation of much of the target territory failed, these troops were neither in position to fulfil their traditional role nor able to fulfil the role specified in the invasion plan. The actual employment of these troops therefore bears consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the number of Spetsnaz units in Russian formations had been expanding rapidly. Most military analysts anticipated that this would lead to Russian formations having a much stronger reconnaissance and direct action capability organic to their brigades. In the Second Chechen War, and in Syria, the Russian military had extensively employed Spetsnaz as reconnaissance troops to screen its advances and in other special forces roles. This was done for some formations during the invasion. For example, Spetsnaz punched into Kharkiv significantly ahead of the conventional forces. Although these formations could have been employed more widely in this way, the expansion of Spetsnaz units had contributed to a shortage of competent contract infantry for the wider Russian military – as most competent infantry had been pushed toward Spetsnaz and airborne units. For the invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin limited the number of conscripts in its battalion tactical groups, while the size of the invasion force prevented the concentration of personnel from across the force to bring those units committed to their full complement. As a result, many Battlegroups were significantly under strength. Russian armoured personnel carriers often contained as few as three infantry. This may not have been a problem if the purpose of the Ground Force was to shock and awe the Ukrainians into folding, enabling the mechanisms of repression to get into Ukraine’s cities and establish control. Once the Russian military found itself in heavy fighting, however, the shortage of infantry became a serious problem. The lack of effective line infantry units caused Spetsnaz units to be deployed mostly as light infantry, which also led to a high level of casualties among these units. Far fewer Spetsnaz were therefore available for special forces missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far from drawing away from this practice, the trend during the war has been for regular tasks to be taken over by irregular forces. The initial Russian invasion plan had envisaged the deployment of Chechen units to support the FSB in establishing the counterintelligence regime on the occupied territories. Once heavy fighting erupted these units were committed as assault troops on key axes, not least Mariupol. In a bid to stem casualties – especially among Russian assault forces – great efforts were put into mobilising battalions from the populations on the occupied territories of Donbas and Luhansk, largely commanded through parts of the Eighth Combined Arms Army. Casualties among these troops were excessive, especially when they were used to conduct mass infantry assaults against Ukrainian trenches in Donbas to fix and identify Ukrainian firing posts for more capable Russian assault troops moving in behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another force that was rerolled was Wagner. The Wagner Group had a peripheral role in the initial invasion plan, largely orchestrating volunteers among Russian partners in Syria and Africa as part of an information campaign to suggest that Russia had widespread international support. Since the invasion was supposed to be quick, Wagner was not initially withdrawn from the range of commitments it held in Africa, and even expanded some of these tasks – as in Mali – during the early phase of the war. The disarray among Russian conventional forces following their setbacks in the opening weeks of the war made it immediately apparent that there would be a shortage of military specialists and assault troops. At first, this led to Wagner moving personnel from its wider deployments into Ukraine and, since then, has seen Wagner embark on massive recruitment drives, including in Russian prisons. Wagner has also spearheaded bringing skilled Russian personnel back into service – such as pilots – often with offers of significantly inflated salaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prominence of Wagner and several other private irregular armies in the Russian forces bears scrutiny because most of these organisations originated as part of Russia’s special services. The Wagner Group emerged from a battalion of irregulars supported by the GRU in Donbas in 2014. In its operations in Africa and Syria, GRU officers would routinely embed into Wagner units, using them as cover or being the link with Russian conventional capabilities to enable Wagner forces. Given the political prominence of Yevgeny Prigozhyn, it would be inaccurate to say that Wagner remains entirely subordinate to the GRU. In fact, the GRU has often routed political recommendations to Putin through Prigozhyn rather than its own official chain of command. Instead, it would be fairer to say that the GRU and Wagner are strongly intertwined. Despite transcending the GRU’s chain of command, the supply of weapons and military equipment to Wagner is carried out by the structures of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation through the 78th Special Reconnaissance Centre and the 22nd Special Forces Brigade of the GRU. Alongside Wagner are other organisations, often built around specific capabilities such as UAVs. A good example is PWC Redut, largely led by former Wagner personnel, but organised around reconnaissance, intelligence and sabotage missions, and commanded by a GRU officer previously responsible for Wagner’s intelligence operations. It is anticipated that the number of private military companies sponsored by arms of the Russian government and associated entities is likely to increase over the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significance of special forces-enabled irregular units to the Russian military is exacerbated by the state of Russian industry. The Orlan-10 UAV, for example, has proven one of the most effective pieces of equipment in the Russian Army’s arsenal for ISR. Although it was developed by the conventional force, the manufacturer receives a significant proportion of its funding from the GRU. More importantly, the export-controlled microelectronics that the manufacturer needs must be procured illicitly through the front companies established and run by Russia’s special services. Another example is the procurement of loitering munitions from Iran. The burgeoning strategic relationship with Iran was initially enabled by outreach conducted and maintained by Russia’s special services with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Given that Russian defence industry is increasingly dependent on these structures, who gets equipment in the Russian military is also partly determined by their connections with the irregular organisations. This resource allocation in turn determines who has the capabilities to own battlespace and problem sets in the field. In time, Russia’s conventional forces may reassert control. National mobilisation may reduce the dependence on irregular formations. For military specialisms, however, it is likely that the foreign currency and equipment available to these units will see their importance to the Russian war effort remain high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia’s conventional Spetsnaz have increasingly been used as assault troops, the practices of Spetsnaz controlled directly by the special services have arguably reverted to a more Soviet approach and away from the Western special forces model that Russia has attempted to develop over the past decade. This has seen the employment of Spetsnaz in more intimate collaboration with human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;human-intelligence-and-reconnaissance&quot;&gt;Human Intelligence and Reconnaissance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The failure of Russian forces to occupy the target territory left a large body of agents in place. Similarly, for Ukraine, the overrunning of its territory saw a large part of the Ukrainian population stranded in areas under Russian control. This left in place the opportunity for resistance operations. Although the mechanisms for countering the threat from within Ukraine as compared with the counterintelligence regime on the occupied territories differ, the pressures on these Russian and Ukrainian networks have led to a similar prioritisation of tasks and adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proportion of Ukraine’s population prepared to resist the invaders was and is high. Although the will to resist is a prerequisite, however, it is not sufficient in and of itself to make resistance effective. In the early days of the invasion, for example, there were organised peaceful demonstrations in several occupied towns and cities. These had no effect, and the organisers were subsequently targeted for suppression. There has been value in graffiti and other demonstrations of the continued existence of the resistance movement, but only in sustaining the movement itself, rather than in having any significant psychological effect on the enemy. The organisation of sabotage and similar direct action is possible but also largely ineffective unless coordinated across multiple areas and carried out at scale. Any such operations tend to lead to the capture or disruption of the networks involved. Direct action therefore is used sparingly for two purposes: destabilisation of the counterintelligence regime on the territory; and the synchronised disruption of Russian units ahead of conventional forces moving into an area. Indeed, in most cases, direct action has actually been carried out by the special forces of Ukraine’s special services who are assisted by the resistance movement in their ability to transit and operate in areas. As these personnel can withdraw after carrying out an action, they pose less of a risk to the unravelling of the networks in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The much more useful and persistent value of the resistance movement is for reconnaissance and intelligence gathering. If carried out using the appropriate tradecraft, this can be executed without causing networks to be routinely unravelled by the counterintelligence regime. In the early days of the conflict, human reporting enabled the targeting of Russian units with artillery. Over time, the persistent human intelligence network held together by the resistance movement has been critical to the accurate targeting of Russian command and control and logistics infrastructure using the long-range precision fires supplied by military technical assistance from Ukraine’s international partners. The details of how the resistance movement is run is clearly operationally sensitive and is not detailed here. Nevertheless, it bears emphasising that the skills for running such networks are primarily those of human intelligence handling and covert communications and that the personnel best suited to this activity are mainly drawn from the special services rather than from the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian military has resorted to a similar prioritisation of tasks among its agent network inside of Ukraine. Direct action has not constituted the primary threat from these personnel, though it does occur. Instead, the value of this network has been in assisting with the targeting of both the Ukrainian military and critical national infrastructure, including the conduct of battle damage assessments of energy infrastructure. The existing agent apparatus provides a strong foundation for running such operations and often the targeting information can be passed by commercial encrypted messengers to Russian handlers in Europe or elsewhere before it is routed into Russia. Nevertheless, maintaining this activity does place a premium on human intelligence, covert communication and tradecraft. Reflecting this prioritisation there has been a restructuring within the GRU. Having suffered several exposures in recent years, especially surrounding the personnel of Unit 29155 responsible for sabotage and assassination, this unit has apparently been transferred out of the clandestine space. At the same time, Andrei Averianov – previously commanding 29155 – was promoted and assigned three units under his command with tasks similar to those of his previous centre. Averianov and his new units are part of the structure of the 5th Department of the GRU, which is responsible for human intelligence. It is important to note that in many respects this is a return to form after several years of trying to create a more Western-style special forces capability. According to extant GRU instruction manuals, special operations are best carried out by illegal intelligence assets, which makes special operations practitioners first and foremost human intelligence officers, who are also capable of organising direct action, rather than vice versa. Historically, the relationship between Spetsnaz and military intelligence was very close, and a significant number of GRU employees began their careers in Spetsnaz. The role of human intelligence is especially important for units directly subordinated to the GRU. Thus, some officers of Unit 29155, who were exposed and can no longer be used undercover, are now involved in remote recruitment and management of agent networks on the territory of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it may be said that the Russians do not have much trouble obtaining information about targets or locations. Their capacity to collect is significant. Assembling, analysing and disseminating this information, however, is a different matter. It is understood within the Ukrainian intelligence community that the GRU has established a targeting centre for coordinating its reconnaissance across Ukraine. Reports from human agents are routed to this centre for analysis. Here analysts produce a daily overview of detections, cross referenced with GRU geospatial intelligence and other collection methods. These digests are then either sent to the relevant military district command post and thereafter downwards to the fire control headquarters of a combined arms army and then to the artillery tactical group if the target was of a tactical nature, or to the VKS, Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol or Iskandr battalions for a deliberate long-range strike. The evidence suggests that the ingestion and analysis of detections by the targeting centre would work on a 24-hour cycle. The target packs then provided to the relevant echelon would be sent with limited contextual information to determine prioritisation – and targets were often struck in the order in which target packs were received rather than in an order reflecting the characteristics or value of the target. Often the distribution of these instructions and the target’s place in the series of tasks of the unit assigned to conduct the strike would take at least 24 hours. Sometimes this was much longer, especially where it required Russian naval assets to move to a position and launch Kalibr missiles. Furthermore, some targets struck were military installations many years ago, suggesting that there is a drive for the GRU to generate targets even when it does not have current intelligence. The result has been a persistent problem for the Russians with latency between their collection and their ability to strike targets. Despite the shortcomings of Russia’s targeting cycle, the fact that they have consistently found targets and have the means to strike them means that how to identify and break up these human reconnaissance networks is a key question for the rear area security of NATO conventional forces in the event of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In studying the forms and methods of Russia’s unconventional war against Ukraine, it is worth considering the strengths of the Russian special services, their systemic weaknesses and the extent to which they will remain a major threat in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with Russian strengths, it is evident that the Russian special services managed to recruit a large agent network in Ukraine prior to the invasion and that much of the support apparatus has remained viable after the invasion, providing a steady stream of human intelligence to Russian forces. The internal threat significantly constrained the political room for manoeuvre for the Ukrainian state prior to the conflict and this produced unfavourable conditions for preparing the population for war. There has, for many years, been a bias in many states to favour collection against Russian activities on their territories. The evidence from Ukraine strongly suggests that Russian subversion should be actively resisted and disrupted before it can build up the mutually supporting structure that existed in Ukraine. The Russian tendency to corrupt targets for recruitment and to recruit under a false flag appears to be an effective means of building large networks quickly, though the reliability of individual agents is arguably much less than those recruited for ideological reasons. The tendency to rely on a small number of elite agents who run their own networks also means that moving against these individuals has a disproportionate impact on Russian capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it is important to acknowledge that the threats outlined in this report – of high-level recruitment and the build-up of a support apparatus – is not a problem limited to Ukraine. During the course of the conflict both a senior signals intelligence analyst in the BND and a senior counterintelligence officer in the BND have been uncovered as Russian agents. The same methods are used, to some effect, widely. And the consequences of failing to counter this activity are significant. In April 2022 the authors of this report highlighted the extensive discussions in the Russian special services regarding their capacity to destabilise Moldova, in order ‘for destabilisation and the broadening of the front to protect [protract] and expand the economic and political costs on the West’. The attempt to destabilise Moldova appears now to be being attempted. It is important that states are proactive in preventing Russia building up these capabilities in their countries and, where this has been achieved, actively closing down these networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another strength of the Russian unconventional warfare capabilities is their systematic methodology for repression of occupied territories. Although crude and violent – having a terrible effect on the economy and quality of life in targeted areas – it does appear to be an effective method of constraining resistance activities to a manageable level and maintaining control. The evidence from Chechnya suggests that it may take a generation for resistance to be fully quashed, but that does not mean that resistance activities threaten the Russian position. It is also important to note that the digitised tools that have proven an effective enabler of this counterintelligence apparatus are exportable to other autocracies and may be a feature of Russia’s offer to elites in states where it wishes to maintain influence. For NATO forces, the strength of the counterintelligence regime strongly suggests that partnered resistance operations need to be calibrated towards reconnaissance rather than direct action unless the territory on which the resistance network is active is likely to be imminently liberated. Those interfacing with these networks need to prioritise skills in handling human agents and in covert communications if their networks are to remain survivable. Another key lesson is that any resistance network established prior to a conflict must be invisible to the bureaucracy of the state, or else it risks exposure through the capture of a state’s records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are also clearly considerable deficiencies in Russia’s approach to unconventional warfare. At a fundamental level the Russian special services lack self-awareness, or at least the honesty to report accurately about their own efforts. In the case of Ukraine, a plan was attempted that was critically dependent on unconventional methods when the preconditions for success had not yet been achieved. This reveals wider cultural problems in the Russian services. That they are directed to bring about an outcome without independently assessing the viability of the plan creates a reporting culture where officers are encouraged to have a significant optimism bias. Furthermore, there appears to be a systemic problem of overreporting one’s successes and concealing weaknesses to superiors. This is evidenced by the overly optimistic assessment of the proportion of Russia’s agent network that would be proactive in supporting Russia in the context of a full-scale invasion. The fact that this lack of self-awareness in the Russian services contributes to blunders can certainly be exploited by counterespionage officers, but is far from comforting as it leads to a situation in which the Russians are difficult to deter because they have an unrealistic estimation of the likelihood of their success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another significant vulnerability in Russia’s approach to unconventional warfare is that it is formulaic. When under pressure, the reaction has been to revert to tried and tested forms and methods from the Soviet period rather than to innovate. Furthermore, because of the scale at which these activities are attempted, once a particular form or method is exposed it tends to have been widely replicated allowing for the rapid detection of a wide range of unconnected activities. The Russian system does not appear to encourage treating each operation as bespoke. Although this does mean that Russian operations can scale quickly against an unsuspecting target, there is also a real vulnerability to an alert target because operations risk exposing one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this tendency to revert under pressure to established forms and methods, there is considerable dynamism and entrepreneurialism among Russia’s special services. As demonstrated by Wagner or the restructuring of the GRU’s clandestine capabilities while in contact, the services are quick to seize on opportunities and have the policies and permissions to do so. This is exacerbated by the political dynamic behind their employment, which is perhaps best captured in Ian Kershaw’s phrase describing the animation of the Hitlerite state as ‘working towards the Fuhrer’. The special services are encouraged to develop operations consistent with their understanding of Putin’s intent and, depending upon which is closest to his will and is more successful, there flows resource and attention. This kind of internal competition also allows Putin to reward or punish service chiefs and officials without their ever feeling truly secure. These dynamics make the special services highly active and willing to accept risk. It also distorts analysis, encouraging exaggeration of both their prospects in reporting and a catastrophism in ascribing failure to the scale of adversary efforts. It encourages blame shifting internally, limiting accurate after-action reviews. The upshot is that, while the Russian services may have failed in Ukraine, this is unlikely to prevent their being central to the coercive activities of the Russian state in the future, and countering them will remain no less important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s efforts to dominate and potentially weaponize next-generation technologies are now garnering considerable attention. In October 2022, the Biden administration imposed wide-ranging restrictions on China’s access to advanced chip technologies, and it is considering additional actions on quantum computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and biotechnologies. These measures come on top of broader Western efforts to constrain China’s growing dominance in telecommunications and surveillance technologies, such as those provided by Huawei, ZTE, Hikvision, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond their implications for weapons systems, these efforts reflect concerns regarding whose technologies will underlie our increasingly digital societies and what those technologies might be used for. Only recently, however, have the risks posed by China’s internet platforms — social media, e-commerce, and search applications such as TikTok, AliExpress, and WeChat — begun to be considered. Like their U.S. counterparts (such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon), Chinese platforms facilitate user interaction and offer community, connectivity, shopping, news, entertainment, search, and many other now indispensable functions for our internet-reliant digital societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With TikTok’s explosive growth in the United States, there is a surge in efforts to ban the app at local, state, and federal levels. Much of the concern has focused on the data collection and surveillance possibilities the Chinese-owned app might provide to Beijing. While those risks are real, the influence capabilities of TikTok are, surprisingly, only just gaining attention. The focus on TikTok’s influence appears overdue given what we know about the influence wielded by platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Amazon. By many measures, TikTok is both more addictive and more influential than its U.S. counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nations such as Russia, China, and Iran have understood the soft powers of platforms for some time. They have used Western platforms to influence not only U.S. and other Western elections, but also social discourse and civil society. Studies show that these efforts have had measurable impacts by shaping online and offline civic action, initiating and fanning conspiracy theories, and promoting divisions in society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth and spread of Chinese platforms globally pose additional risks. In the West, these platforms are likely to be constrained through government regulation. But in much of the rest of the world, their proliferation offers China powerful influence capabilities that could be used (and in many cases already is being used) to undermine democratic institutions and processes, sow discord, and boost China’s image and interests. Given modern societies’ reliance on internet platforms, if Chinese platforms become preeminent in numerous countries around the world, they would contribute significantly to China’s command of the internet — and with it a commensurate diminishment of U.S. business, power, and global influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;internet-platforms-are-nearly-everywhere&quot;&gt;Internet Platforms Are Nearly Everywhere&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet has become indispensable to modern life, and platforms offering social media, e-commerce, and search functions have become an indispensable, almost indistinguishable, part of the online experience. This is true throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, nearly two-thirds (5.03 billion) of all people have access to the internet. For those not yet connected, significant efforts are under way around the world to bring digital connectivity to underserved communities. The vast majority of today’s internet users also use social media (4.7 billion, or 59 percent of the global population); while global internet users grew by 4 percent in 2021, social media users grew by 10 percent, more than twice that pace. On average, internet users spend a remarkable seven hours a day online — two and a half of those on social media, or 15 percent of an individual’s waking hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just social media. More than three-quarters of internet users between the ages of 16 and 64 also report using e-commerce (buying something online) each month. E-commerce is revolutionizing retail and with it global supply chains, logistics, and payment systems. Nearly 20 percent of all retail commerce is now handled through e-commerce platforms, and that number is expected to rise to 24 percent by 2026. In dollar terms, that equates to an increase from $5.2 trillion to $8.1 trillion over four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popularity of social media and e-commerce apps, however, is surpassed only by search engine apps such as Google. In fact, the majority of internet users (63 percent) cite “search” as the primary reason they go online. It is so valuable to individuals that, according to internet scholars Erik Brynjolfsson and Avinash Collis, the median price you would have to pay an individual in the United States to forego their ability to use internet search for one year was $17,000 — and this was before the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media, e-commerce, and search are three of the key functions that are both essential to and synonymous with today’s digital world. Platforms offering these features bring not only community, connection, and services, but have themselves become part of the essential infrastructure of the internet as portals to many other services and connections: advertising, maps, news, resources, websites, and much more. Moreover, platform companies such as Amazon are now extending their capabilities beyond user experience and services to cloud computing and content delivery networks (CDNs), essential infrastructure of our connected world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;platforms-are-architected-for-influence&quot;&gt;Platforms Are Architected for Influence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As these platforms have gained power in the global economy, their ability to shape what users experience has also come to light. Independent research, whistleblowers, and government investigations have detailed disturbing powers of influence that can be exercised through these platforms. For instance, a report by Avaaz found that four times more views were generated by the 10 most popular Facebook Covid-19 misinformation sites compared to content from the 10 leading international health institutions (e.g., the WHO and CDC). Amazon favors its products over those of third-party retailers selling on its platform, and its logistics business was found to have reshaped supply chains and logistics in the United States, largely to its favor. The European Union fined Google over 8 billion euros for favoring its products and services over those of independent companies using its platform. Perhaps more disturbing, multiple studies found that social media and search platforms have been able to sway voters in the United States and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, mounting evidence shows platforms have and exert powers of influence over social discourse, beliefs, and behaviors. They can affect elections and buying habits, undermine factual accounts, stir social discord, and shift political, social, and commercial behaviors. These powers partly arise out of the role platforms increasingly play as vital internet infrastructure and gateways, as well as key elements of social, commercial, governmental, and political interaction in modern societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These influence powers also arise out of the design characteristics of the platforms themselves. Social media, search, and e-commerce platforms are, in effect, designed as “architectures of influence.” They are explicitly built to engage users and keep them engaged through a powerful mix of data on those users, stimulation of the brain chemical dopamine, and algorithms that continuously test and refine stimuli to enhance engagement. This is the “business logic” of platform technologies — through data, dopamine, and algorithms they keep users attracted and engaged. This generates advertising and transaction revenue while also amassing saleable data and helping refine algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This underlying business logic gives rise to other levers of influence in platform architecture, such as “structural attributes,” the capabilities platforms possess to purposefully shape what users are seeing and experiencing. Platforms largely use three methods: surveillance, chokeholds, and moderation. Surveillance includes the ability to monitor users’ activities, their purchases, who they friend, where they are located, what information they exchange, and the like. Because platforms control the algorithms and the user experience, they are also able to “choke off” or limit access to content (chokeholds or chokepoints). Some of these chokehold powers are desirable or even legally mandated, such as preventing access to violent videos or child pornography. But platforms can also impose their own chokeholds, restricting content they deem undesirable, such as political messaging with which they disagree. Beyond surveillance and chokeholds, platforms exercise active moderation, which entails purposeful efforts to steer users to particular content and away from other content — for example, by promoting one product over another or one kind of political messaging over another. Moderation is the ability to purposefully shape and refine what users see and experience. Thus, platforms’ structural attributes, building on their business logic, give them considerable powers of influence over their users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final layer of influence architecture, called “leveraged affordances,” refers to platforms’ operation as open spaces that enable multiple users to exchange information with each other — and, in many cases, to seek to influence other users on the platform. Today, internet influencers drive billions of dollars in product sales, ignite trends, define fashions, and much more. But other users, leveraging the capabilities platforms offer to reach a broad audience, sow conspiracy theories, promote disinformation or misinformation, and seek to steer online and offline behavior — including voting and insurrections. These often involve the use of techniques such as bots, fake users, and flooding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These design and performance characteristics of platforms create an environment where influence can be exercised by at least five different actors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the platforms themselves,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;users of the platform,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the sovereign nation from which the platform originates,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a host nation where the platform operates (outside its sovereign territory), and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cyber intruders or hackers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These actors may contest and counterbalance each other on the platform, but it is the platform business itself that becomes the final arbiter and thus is often the most critical actor — enabling, constraining, or exerting influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinese-platforms-and-influence&quot;&gt;Chinese Platforms and Influence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese platforms were built on the same principles as those of the West. Indeed, for a few years Western platforms competed in China with Chinese platforms. However, through a combination of regulatory constraints and intense competition, by 2010 most Western platforms were forced to or chose to exit the country. Western capital, however, did not: Through a series of finance-raising efforts on international and domestic markets, Chinese platform companies such as Tencent and Alibaba raised billions of dollars to fund next-generation innovation and their own domestic and international expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, China has some of world’s leading social media, e-commerce, and search platforms, which offer immersive and deeply compelling digital ecosystems that have brought products, services, connectivity, and financial access to hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens — not to mention users abroad. In fact, Chinese platforms have been at the forefront of digital innovation, bringing into the mainstream addictive short-video formats (such as TikTok), digital payment and credit scoring systems, QR codes, influencer-driven selling, community buying programs, and much more. For a number of years, China’s digital innovation has been regarded by industry observers as well ahead of that of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s powerful and innovative platforms — with their all-encompassing user experiences, data aggregation, and algorithmic manipulations — are also critical to the country’s domestic surveillance and control systems. Numerous studies have shown that in order to grow and flourish in China’s environment, these platforms have had to make concessions to and partner with the government. Today, China’s leading platforms are essential to the nation’s increasingly authoritarian surveillance and control architecture. While a host of technology firms are involved (from facial recognition software developers to broadband providers), platform companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu — through which citizens interface with technology — all play critical and instrumental roles as partners to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in blocking unwanted content, promoting government narratives, prompting “appropriate” behaviors, and reporting on users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether by choice, design, or compulsion, Chinese platforms are active — even pro-active — partners of the CCP. As a result, they have developed and continue to develop advanced forms of exerting or enabling influence. These practices are built into their business operations, culture, and technology architecture. Arguably, as seen with TikTok, their influence capabilities are significant and, in some respects, more robust than those of competing Western platforms. Drawing from their extensive domestic experience, Chinese platforms are notably more practiced in directly exerting and facilitating influence. Said another way, their “architectures of influence” are stronger and more attuned to wielding power than those of the West. The regulatory crackdown in China has served to further enhance the power of the CCP (the “platform sovereign”) to dictate what these platforms do and how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As these platforms expand beyond China, they have brought these capabilities and predispositions with them. For example, Tencent’s WeChat has around 200 million users outside of China. The app was found to be a highly moderated platform for Chinese influence operations through news channels, influencers, and censorship. The system is so insular and attuned to China’s interests that WeChat even censored messages from Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, who was rebutting misinformation the Chinese government had spread on the app — but his messages were never received by Australia’s WeChat users. In 2022, WeChat simply disabled Morrison’s access and sold the account to a Chinese company. Australia is not the only example. WeChat took similar action in Canada, censoring a Canadian parliamentarian’s post to her Canadian WeChat followers when she expressed support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. WeChat posts by users abroad have also invited harassment of their family, friends, and business relations inside China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WeChat’s user base may be influential, but outside China it is arguably small. However, its parent company, Tencent, is the largest gaming company in the world. Therefore, when Tencent censors live chats between its gamers — as it has been doing since at least 2018, blanking out words like Taiwan, Uyghur, Tibet, and other sensitive topics — this arguably has a significant impact across its 1.4 billion users globally. More striking is that Tencent has openly sanctioned gamers outside China who raise issues such as the Hong Kong protests. After Ng “Blitzchung” Wai Chung supported the Hong Kong protests during an official tournament, Hearthstone publisher Activision Blizzard (partially owned at that time by Tencent) “issued steep sanctions on the player,” and Tencent-owned Riot Games followed suit by “warning broadcasters and players to stay away from any ‘sensitive topics’ during 2019’s League of Legends World Championship. This included the Hong Kong protests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tencent’s companies are not alone in these efforts. ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, was found to be censoring negative news about China on another one of its apps, BaBe, in its Indonesian operations. TikTok itself had “moderation” guidelines that prohibited topics that China considers sensitive (such as Xinjiang, Tibet, and Tiananmen). These actions are not limited to social media platforms, however. China’s leading e-commerce firm, Alibaba, suspended its most popular Russian-language influencer, a Ukrainian, when he posted accounts of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that differed from the Russian — and Chinese — narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese platforms are clearly powerful influence engines, and they have been harnessed in support of CCP interests both inside and outside China. But are these platforms truly competitors of U.S. platforms on the global stage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinese-platforms-international-expansion&quot;&gt;Chinese Platforms’ International Expansion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese platforms have been expanding outside China since the early 2010s. This is especially so in emerging markets, where they have natural advantages stemming from their “mobile first” designs, integration of e-payments, and integration with the internet technology infrastructure (“tech stack”) that China is building through its Digital Silk Road (DSR). The DSR is the technology component of the country’s signature foreign-policy Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It seeks to expand markets for Chinese technology companies while building commercial, social, and people-to-people connectivity between recipient countries and China. The DSR offers countries easy financing, government support, and encouragement for Chinese technology companies expanding overseas, particularly in emerging economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese platform expansion has also been driven by strong commercial interests, competition, and abundant capital reserves. Along with far-reaching Chinese government support and encouragement, these companies have primarily used four methods to expand globally:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Service extensions: This involves the expansion of service offerings within a country (adding e-commerce to a social media platform, for example) or extending services to countries previously not served.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expanding technology infrastructure: This includes building data centers, content delivery networks, and cloud services in a country. In so doing, platforms are not only enabling or expanding their own service offerings, but more closely linking their operations to the tech stack often being built (and maintained) by other Chinese companies. This interoperability within the tech stack may serve Chinese interests if and when there is a decoupling between Western and Chinese digital technologies and ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engaging in venture capital: Venture capital (VC) investments have proliferated not only in China, but in many countries around the world. Some of this is through branded corporate venture capital (CVC), but much of this investment takes place through venture capital firms not visibly associated with the platforms. Investing through other VC firms enables the platforms to diffuse equity risks while capturing insights into innovative or disruptive technologies they could then acquire more directly. These investments also allow the platforms access to technologies and companies without direct brand identification. Thus, wherever there is significant VC activity, it is probable that the platform firms are present in branded and/or unbranded form.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minority and majority share acquisitions: Chinese platforms have been prolific investors and acquirers around the world. As of November 2022, for example, Tencent had made more than 1,100 acquisitions or investments globally, Alibaba more than 260, and Bytedance over 50.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet despite this near frenetic activity, as of 2022, few Chinese platforms could be considered “preeminent” in countries outside of China, meaning they do not comprise a significant majority of users in a given country. Western platforms (and some local or regional ones) dominate search, social media, and e-commerce. Unseating incumbent platforms is difficult due to strong network effects and high switching costs for users. Chinese platform companies have not fared as well as their Western counterparts in terms of common measures of platform leadership such as stock value, market share, and net revenue. Moreover, Chinese platforms face various additional challenges, not least among them the recent tech crackdown in China — a “rectification” that was officially completed in January 2023 — which forced many of these firms to restructure and redirect their investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of these challenges, however, Chinese platforms retain several advantages that — at least in emerging economies — may enhance their ability to eclipse Western platforms. These include their continued investments in and adoption of market-leading innovations (investments that are actually increasing), their integration with the Chinese tech stack in many countries (see Figure 5), and China’s efforts to rewrite internet governance and technology standards globally. Legal scholars Matthew Erie and Thomas Streinz refer to a “Beijing effect” in emerging economies, wherein the attractiveness of China’s vision of “digital sovereignty,” its construction and maintenance of countries’ internet architecture, and its efforts to reshape global technology standards will pull these countries ineluctably into adopting its version of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KA4U2zW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Chinese Successes at Every Level of the Tech Stack.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aspi.org.au/report/mapping-chinas-tech-giants-supply-chains-and-global-data-collection-ecosystem&quot;&gt;Samantha Hoffman and Nathan Attrill, Mapping China’s Tech Giants: Supply chains &amp;amp; the global data collection ecosystem, (Canberra: ASPI, June 2021)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are indeed signs that Chinese platforms are already gaining ground. The explosive emergence and global adoption of Bytedance’s TikTok app is one. With more than 3 billion downloads, it is now on par with or exceeds Facebook downloads, though not yet Facebook’s users. Tencent’s global leadership in gaming gives it an advantage in the development and creation of the next-generation internet (the metaverse), backed by local and national government agencies in China. Alibaba’s global gross merchandise value (the total value of goods and services sold on its platforms) is more than twice that of Amazon. These and other indicators point to potential disruption of U.S. leadership in these key infrastructural elements of today’s digital societies — at least in emerging economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;china-and-emerging-markets&quot;&gt;China and Emerging Markets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging market nations are of vital interest to the United States. They represent almost 80 percent of the world’s people, and by 2050 will host six out of the seven largest economies in the world. The seven largest emerging market economies (E7) will constitute 50 percent of global GDP by 2050, compared with just 30 percent for the G7. The United States and the West rely on many of these nations for more than trade and investment, however important that is to their own economic livelihood. Within international institutions such as the United Nations, these countries have a majority. For example, they hold 130 of the 193 UN seats; these countries will have an increasing voice at the United Nations on issues ranging from human rights to technology standards and security standards. Even more fundamentally, the United States (and the West more broadly) relies on many of these nations for security. For instance, there are around 750 U.S. military bases across nearly 80 countries, many in emerging economies. The Biden administration’s National Security Strategy makes clear the importance of these nations to the United States and to the current system of international institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic influence among these countries has been growing for years. In 2001, 80 percent of nations worldwide had a greater volume of trade with the United States than with China. By 2018, the situation had largely reversed, with 70 percent of nations having a larger volume of trade with China than the United States. Much of China’s expanded trade activity was welcomed in the West — and by the world at large — as a contribution to economic growth and prosperity and as a measure of China’s growing integration with the U.S.-led world order. That thinking has shifted over the past decade, especially since the Covid-19 pandemic. Today, the concern is with countries’ overreliance on China for critical factors in global supply chains, with its efforts to further its military capabilities through advanced technologies, and with its intentions to displace the United States as the leading global power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s investments in the BRI and DSR, the expansion of Chinese technology firms, and China’s efforts to influence global standards setting are just some of the ways it is seeking to create a more China-centric world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese platforms have significant powers of influence, they have used these powers in support of CCP messaging and interests, and they are expanding globally. While Western platforms are creative and nimble, there is a strong chance that China’s innovative and immersive platforms — boosted by the country’s broader digital expansion and its alternative vision of the internet — will become preeminent in numerous emerging economies around the world. Given these platforms’ record of promoting CCP messaging and content, there is a clear risk that U.S./Western business, power, and influence would be impacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What might that look like? Platform influence could shape what consumers buy; how supply chains do (or do not) operate; election outcomes; public sentiment on domestic and international issues; and a nation’s political, economic, and technological dependence on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a social media standpoint, preeminent Chinese platforms would be able to favor and promote messaging preferential to Beijing’s interests — potentially swaying everything from opinions to elections to social harmony. During the Covid-19 crisis, China spread disinformation that the virus originated from a military lab in the United States and then encouraged vaccine hesitancy around the world. When Russia invaded Ukraine, China promoted the view that it was an unprovoked war and that the United States and NATO had forced Russia into a “limited military engagement.” There is a long list of Chinese propaganda and disinformation efforts. Although the presence of alternative news sources currently allows some fact-checking and rebuttal, what will happen when alternative news sources and messaging are significantly diminished?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In e-commerce, slight algorithmic changes can also shift buying behavior and realign supply chains. What happens when the market for products and services favors Chinese providers over Western ones? Furthermore, to the extent companies in these nations rely on China’s internet infrastructure (some of it managed by Chinese platform firms), is it possible to slow order fulfillment from one source and accelerate it from another? When linked with China’s dominant LOGINK logistics platform, could customs clearances and port processing be affected as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In search functions, what might happen when access to a broad range of information sources is curtailed? Manipulation of search results has been shown to affect voter preferences, consumer behavior, and social discord. What about linkages to satellite mapping as China rolls out Beidou, its alternative to the Global Positioning System (GPS), and this becomes the default map software for apps? How might traffic flows, shopping, and investment be adjusted to favor one group over another?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the geopolitical level, these changes could have significant impact on Western businesses, as well as on support for the United States and the West among a nation’s population — and therefore from its government. Wavering support could undermine Western representation and interests in global bodies such as the United Nations, in standards-setting organizations, and even political and military alignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, these are extreme scenarios — but not implausible, given what we already know about platform powers and influence. There is a long tradition of weaponizing industry in geopolitics and geoeconomics, but the understanding of platform powers is just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;platforms-and-geopolitics&quot;&gt;Platforms and Geopolitics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political scientist Susan Strange set out the concept of “structural power” as a defining force in geopolitics and geoeconomics that “confers the power to decide how things shall be done, the power to shape frameworks within which states relate to each other, relate to people, or relate to corporate enterprises. The relative power of each party in a relationship is more, or less, if one party is also determining the surrounding structure of the relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strange outlines four sources of structural power: “control over security; control over production; control over credit; and control over knowledge, beliefs and ideas.” Social media platforms have demonstrated significant powers of control over knowledge, beliefs, and ideas. Digital payment systems, enabled by platforms, have exerted significant control over credit. E-commerce platforms often exert control over production (and distribution) of goods and services. To the extent security systems are linked to platforms, such as in Xinjiang and in the “safe city” installations China has supported around the world, platforms have a degree of control over security as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-policy-response&quot;&gt;U.S. Policy Response&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has several advantages and disadvantages in this contest over global structural power. Its strengths largely arise from U.S. values shared by many people around the world, including free speech, human rights, democracy, the rule of law, and rewarding innovation. It will need to leverage these strengths to sustain a digital world open to a variety of voices and business enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has several disadvantages as well. These include a growing perception that it is behind the times in addressing its own platforms’ local and global powers. Both Europe and China appear to be well ahead of the United States — and in line with popular opinion — in curtailing platforms’ privacy intrusions and algorithmic manipulation. While in China the government has retained the right to access this data and oversee algorithms, consistent with its overall surveillance and control infrastructure, the message it is sending around the world is that it offers a safer version of the internet than the United States can offer. This perception has been compounded by the absence of a strong U.S. role in internet governance and standards-setting organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the United States is largely unable to provide internet tech stack technologies and services at competitive prices equivalent to those offered by the Chinese. China often bundles its technologies into integrated packages that are difficult to compete against. Therefore, even if an emerging economy prefers U.S. technology, from a cost and performance standpoint it is likely to choose Chinese products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, in certain respects U.S. platform technologies are racing to keep up with Chinese digital innovations such as TikTok’s algorithms. Even Facebook’s efforts to build the metaverse may be surpassed by China’s. In the fast-moving world of digital innovation, and with China redirecting investment away from consumer applications toward industrial applications, Chinese innovation may slow. But, so far, that looks unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building from its strengths, the United States is nevertheless capable of shaping this contest and bolstering an open and inclusive internet. It should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Retake a leadership role with respect to data governance and privacy. The United States should lead in passing legislation that protects both human rights and the innovation economy for which it is famous, including laws regarding personal privacy and algorithmic transparency. This is admittedly challenging but will be essential to the legitimacy of U.S. platforms and technologies going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lead in international standards-setting institutions across the technology spectrum. Among these are the International Standards Organization (ISO), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers (IEEE), and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF). Open, transparent standards setting needs to become a priority for the United States. Ensuring U.S. voices and technologies are effectively represented at these standards-setting bodies will help prevent China from defining tomorrow’s technology standards in its sole interest. In addition, the United States should lead in issues of internet governance, making clear the benefits of an open and free internet compared to the closed and authoritarian “digital sovereignty” model China is promoting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase transparency with respect to both U.S. and Chinese platform influence. While there is growing attention to U.S. platform influence, there has been much less research and much less publicity on Chinese platform influence. The United States, international institutions, NGOs, and others need to devote at least as much focus to Chinese digital influence efforts around the world. This is not to shift attention away from the important work of bringing transparency to all platform influences but to ensure that consumers and users around the world understand the implications of Chinese platforms as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Play to U.S. comparative advantages. If U.S. and Western firms cannot compete with the performance and price points of Chinese technology, they have at least two options. First, the United States can provide technical assistance to emerging market countries negotiating contracts with Chinese firms. Such past U.S. efforts have already reduced costs, improved transparency, and provided for greater social and environmental benefits for certain BRI projects. Second, the United States can work with U.S. and Western technology companies to determine if price-competitive alternatives to Chinese technologies could be produced in third countries such as India, Vietnam, or others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invest in continued U.S. innovative leadership. The United States still has the most innovative economy in the world, as demonstrated by the impact of ChatGPT and the recent breakthrough in nuclear fusion. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act of 2022 (CHIPS Act), while a form of industrial planning, also aims to stimulate innovations in various new areas. Greater consideration should be given to U.S. tech industry partnerships with U.S. civilian and military institutions. This is how the internet was founded, and it is useful to keep in mind as competition increases to control the “structural powers” of the twenty-first-century world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The influence powers of internet platforms are now becoming much better understood. As new AI innovations are introduced, the ability of these platforms to shape what users see, believe, and act on will only increase. Chinese platforms are highly innovative and powerful influence engines that are also subject to the CCP’s interests. On their own, there is a strong chance they will rise to preeminence in numerous countries around the world. In combination with China’s build-out of internet infrastructure, its efforts to control standards-setting for internet governance and technologies, and the increasing possibility of decoupling between Western and Chinese technospheres, Chinese platforms stand an even stronger chance of prevailing. If they do, we can expect a shift in structural power from the West to the East, potentially helping realize Xi Jinping’s prediction that “the countries that take command of the internet will win the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BMGOmBz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（28日）踏入審訊第33天。首名控方證人區諾軒昨作供完畢，另一名控方證人趙家賢昨午到庭閱讀數千頁文件，原定今早正式出庭作供。惟今早開庭後，僅法官陳慶偉獨自進庭，表示因法官陳仲衡今天身體不適（unwell），法庭會在今午4時半前通知各方續審的日子和時間，又表示「我對延誤非常抱歉（I am so sorry for the delay）」。聆訊不足一分鐘結束。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;各被告得悉今天審訊無法繼續均反應驚訝，有被告大聲說「哦」，何桂藍、余慧明等面露愕然，在延伸庭的吳敏兒向旁聽席「O嘴」，岑敖暉則露出無奈笑容，黃之鋒亦笑着與其他被告討論。各被告隨後返回囚室，各律師代表同樣面露驚訝，有人說「tragic」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉上周三（22日）起亦身體抱恙，戴上口罩，說話聲線較微弱，至昨天仍有配戴口罩。此外，李予信在本月1日因打泰拳受傷留院，法官認為不能在被告缺席下繼續審訊，決定押後，法官陳仲衡當時提醒獲准保釋的被告不要參與任何危險的運動，陳慶偉指「試想想這裡一天需要多少法律開支」，李運騰亦補充，不僅是律師，外面也有警察駐守，「我們說的是每天數百萬元」，相關做法似乎並不負責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方指前觀塘區議會主席為共謀者 區諾軒完成作供&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/D3RU1va.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（27日）踏入審訊第32天。出庭第24日的區諾軒今作供完畢，控方庭上展示區受時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻所託，向組織者群組轉告有關九東會議的訊息，控方在法官詢問下確認視蔡澤鴻為本案「共謀者」之一，因他出席了多次協調會議，可推論對謀劃知情，多名被告面露驚訝。區其後指區議會主席角色有限，「唔希望人哋收個訊息畀我都有問題，令到好多人有不必要嘅擔心。」法官亦形容一眾組織者退出初選計劃，有如司機駕駛中途突然「跳車」，區指他即使「跳車」仍有留意事態發展，亦承認退出後因「有啲手尾要處理」曾出席港島區會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區作供完畢後，法官陳仲衡提醒區勿與將作供的還柙被告討論案情，區答「法官閣下，就我理解我唔會接觸到，亦都唔會接觸佢哋」，法官陳慶偉補充建議勿接觸任何受審被告，區表示明白，散庭時多人向今天67歲生日的梁國雄賀生日快樂。此外，另一控方證人、同案被告趙家賢下午獲安排到庭閱讀數千頁文件，他身穿黑色風衣、深藍長褲，套上人工耳、頸繫上口罩，於約2小時內讀畢文件，預計明早會宣誓作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指議員否決財案有很多原因如不滿財案或政府施政-若政府無回應五大訴求亦可能反對&quot;&gt;區指議員否決財案有很多原因如不滿財案或政府施政 若政府無回應五大訴求亦可能反對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今先接受代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀補問，其後進入控方覆問。區諾軒曾於盤問表示，「會」運用否決權有三個可能，包括「我淨係話我會否決財預算案」、「我會否決財政預算案係為咗爭取五大訴求」及「我乜都唔理，總之我點都係否決財政預算案㗎啦」。區今在覆問解釋，第三點指「無論財政預算案係乜嘢內容，都會投票反對」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rWFlY9A.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 彭卓棋&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問第一和第三點的分別，區曾解釋就第一點，否決預算案「可以有好多原因，重點係你為咗乜」，區今解釋，立會議員可能不滿意財政預算案內容、對政府施政不滿、或對某一項開支有質疑而否決預算案，故要視乎當事人「究竟係抱持乜嘢理由去否決」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第二點，區同意若預算案與五大訴求有關，如撥款成立獨立調查委員會，議員會審視預算案內容才決定是否否決；而若預算案內無五大訴求的內容，政府又無就五大訴求作回應，便會「推論」該名議員會投反對票。惟法官陳慶偉糾正應是「期望」而非「推論」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官稱退出初選如司機在駕駛中途跳車-區指跳車後亦有留意事態發展&quot;&gt;官稱退出初選如司機在駕駛中途跳車 區指跳車後亦有留意事態發展&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就區諾軒早前表示組織者曾在 Facebook 公開宣布「35+」計劃暫緩，周天行問，曾否作出將計劃撤回或暫緩的決定？區重申當時中聯辦和港澳辦發聲明譴責後，「我認為初選嘅計劃必須終止」，遂去戴耀廷港大辦公室稱要終止計劃及他會退出，望戴認同，戴則指「要一啲時間諗一諗」。區其後聯絡趙家賢談及相同說話，趙指若區退出，他也會退出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區其後在7月15日早上宣布退出，並向趙及戴提及，二人隨後都相繼在 Facebook 發文分別宣布退出初選和休息。周天行問及，有沒有宣布「35+計劃」停止？陳慶偉補充是指官方聲明。區指「只能夠睇呢三個 post、三個帖文，就冇再有進一步嘅聲明或者資訊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，故情況有如當一輛車在行駛，司機突然跳車？吳政亨、柯耀林、陳志全等多人發笑。區指因為「件事都係行進緊」，亦不知道立法會選舉會是什麼情況，笑言「我會話即使啲司機跳咗車都好，至少我，都有謹慎留意事態發展」，何啟明和陳志全等發笑，林卓廷則面露驚訝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指即使退出不同政團參與者仍會參選不知道三投三不投是否也停止&quot;&gt;區指即使退出不同政團參與者仍會參選、不知道「三投三不投」是否也停止&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再問，但車輛仍在前進？區指因為「時間過得真係好快」，重申到報名時有留意情況，包括大約有誰報名，但沒特別留意有沒有初選勝出者沒報名，而最後選舉亦延期。區又指，「有樣嘢我哋係難做嘅」，就是即使組織者相繼退出，但不同參與者也是不同政團的人士，「佢哋始終都係會參與立法會選舉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行一度再問，區指組織者退出是指哪個組織者，惟陳慶偉即不耐煩指「我們知道，我們不是那麼蠢」。陳續問，區是否知道「三投三不投」計劃也停止，區指不知道，同意只知道該計劃何時開始，但不知何時終結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指民主黨立場是一直同意否決預算案-官質疑胡志偉曾表示保留&quot;&gt;控方指民主黨立場是一直同意否決預算案 官質疑胡志偉曾表示保留&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒作供亦曾提及，曾與時任民主黨主席胡志偉見面，胡表示不希望簽官方協議，又指民主黨「冇理由政府話起學校、起醫院都要否決」。區在覆問下，指與胡見面是6月中「墨落無悔」聲明書發布後，法官李運騰問控方用意，周天行解釋想澄清時序。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官其後請區諾軒避席，問控方想帶出什麼，周指想說明民主黨一直同意否決預算案，而其立場沒有改變。陳慶偉質疑胡曾在見面時提及對否決預算案有保留，即不會無差別否決，如何能說民主黨立場一致，惟周指胡在論壇上曾提及參與協調會議以來，民主黨在否決預算案立場一致。李運騰再問為何需要知道會議的確實日期，周解釋因區在6月14日，曾在組織者群組提及民主黨會否決預算案，只是不會簽官方聲明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指蔡澤鴻是共謀者曾出席多次會議故知情-區指區議會主席角色有限不望引起擔心&quot;&gt;控方指蔡澤鴻是共謀者、曾出席多次會議故知情 區指區議會主席角色有限不望引起擔心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒其後再入庭，在陳慶偉詢問下同意根據與胡志偉的會面，民主黨對綑綁否決預算案的立場有保留。控方其後展示上述6月14日的訊息，區諾軒當時表示九龍東當晚開協調會議，時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻託他向大會報告5點，包括九東認為要發布公開協議，及民主黨立場是願意簽官方聲明；蔡又指望大會接納，否則「怕兵變」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰表示，該5點明顯是蔡澤鴻向區覆述的說話，問控方是否想指控蔡是其中一名共謀者（co-conspirator）？但他的名字並沒有在公訴書（indictment）上出現，即非本案被告。周天行表示，公訴書有提及與「其他人」串謀。李追問「其他人」是否包括蔡？周一度呆住，控方團隊向他耳語，周沉默數秒再答「是」，確認指蔡是共謀者。李追問有何基礎，周指因蔡出席了多次會議，根據證據可推論他對謀劃知情。彭卓棋、鄭達鴻、余慧明等多名被告一臉驚訝，被告欄亦傳來「吓？」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區其後確認，在6月14日發訊息前與胡志偉會面，並表示雖然胡有簽署九東共同綱領，但他到了選舉論壇亦有表示贊成政府建學校和醫院。區亦雙手合十，當時只是從蔡澤鴻收到上述訊息，正如他之前所述，「區議會主席角色有限，只係見證人，我唔希望人哋收個訊息畀我都有問題，咁就會令到好多人有不必要嘅擔心。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒宣布退出後仍出席717港島會議-解釋有啲手尾要處理&quot;&gt;區諾軒宣布退出後仍出席7.17港島會議 解釋「有啲手尾要處理」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就楊雪盈初選落敗仍違共識參選，區曾指港島候選人沒有透露誰是替補人選，惟確認楊並非任何人的替補人選。周天行欲問區是如何得知，惟李運騰指區已給出肯定的答案，陳慶偉亦指問題無關。周再問，楊最終報名立法會選舉，是否出於「Plan B」的安排？陳慶偉指計劃已經停止，惟周指戴耀廷當時雖表示要休息，但提及仍有工作未完成，故謀劃當時並未停止。李運騰指那應留待陳詞，陳慶偉亦指控方應在主問時便一早問及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後展示港島區的 WhatsApp 群組紀錄，李運騰關注7月17日有會議，問區有否出席，區確認。李問區為何在7月15日宣布退出後仍出席，區解釋當時港島「仲有啲手尾要處理」，尚未談好派4隊抑或5隊出選。李追問，故區即使公開宣布退出計劃，仍沒有完全退出？區答「喺嗰一刻係，但係之後我都冇再參與喇」，李再追問，即區宣布退出，但事實上沒退出？區重申「原本因為我係處理香港島嘅協調會議，咁我覺得係有啲手尾我要處理埋佢嘅」，但表示結果是「唔成功」。區亦不記得當天有沒有向與會者提及已退出計劃，但相信大家當時都知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方展示港島區whatsapp-徐子見曾提補底計劃楊提及會與徐報名參選&quot;&gt;控方展示港島區WhatsApp 徐子見曾提補底計劃、楊提及會與徐報名參選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續展示紀錄，指梁晃維、許智峯、鄭達鴻在準備「Plan B」，惟李運騰質疑在盤問無提及，又指控方即使在覆問，可發問的事宜亦有限。紀錄續顯示，徐子見在7月31日提及政府大規模DQ候選人，由於不肯定「Plan B」會否也被DQ，故前一日的會議談及要有「補底計劃」。周問港島區7月30日有否舉行會議，區指「佢哋最後係舉行得唔成功嘅」，亦指他沒有出席當天的會議，陳慶偉再問31日是不沒有會議？區指根據訊息「佢哋最後係開唔到會㗎」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;紀錄顯示，楊雪盈其後提及她會與徐子見一起報名參選，周天行問在此背景下，楊報名參選還是否違反共識？惟李運騰質疑區也只是根據 WhatsApp 回答，但最終是法庭而非證人作出推論，陳慶偉不准控方發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒完成盤問-稱不會亦不能接觸同案證人&quot;&gt;區諾軒完成盤問 稱不會亦不能接觸同案證人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後表示已完成覆問，區諾軒完成作供。他起身向旁聽席注視和點頭，離開前法官陳仲衡提醒，尚有還柙被告要作供，着區勿與其他證人討論案情，區答「法官閣下，就我理解我唔會接觸到，亦都唔會接觸佢哋」。法官陳慶偉補充不只是將作證的被告，亦建議區不要接觸任何受審被告，區答「明白，法官閣下」，離開前再向律師席方向點頭，隨兩名懲教人員離開。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;長毛今67歲生日-多名旁聽人士祝生日快樂&quot;&gt;長毛今67歲生日 多名旁聽人士祝「生日快樂」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪其後表示，下午趙家賢會在庭上閱讀文件，並對趙家賢在宣誓前閱讀沒有意見。代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉關注部分文件的呈堂性，指有文件並非從趙家賢、而是從民主動力職員黎敬輝擷取，惟控方曾表明不傳召黎。李運騰指文件呈堂性和證人是否可在庭上閱讀文件是兩回事，指辯方屆時可提出和就此盤問，而證人獲准閱讀文件亦不代表文件獲准呈堂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉遂下令休庭讓趙閱讀文件。散庭時，社民連陳寶瑩、陳皓桓和一名女童上前，向今天67歲生日的梁國雄高喊：「毛哥生日快樂」、「毛伯伯生日快樂！」，梁國雄亦揮手回應。今早入庭時黃浩銘、陳寶瑩等亦有賀梁國雄生日快樂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢下午於庭內閱畢數千頁文件&quot;&gt;趙家賢下午於庭內閱畢數千頁文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢下午獲安排在庭上閱讀文件，法官並不在場。記者於下午約2時40分獲准進入法庭，身穿黑色風衣、深藍長褲，套上人工耳、頸繫上口罩的趙家賢已坐在證人台，以手提電腦閱讀文件，被3名懲教看守。庭上有約10名旁聽人士及數名記者，沒有被告到場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢讀文件期間默不作聲，僅有一次向法庭職員確認進度。他於下午4時34分示意已完成閱讀文件，隨3名懲教沿被告欄步入囚室，離開時一度以右手揉大腿。案件明早續審，預料將傳召趙家賢作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方大狀未戴好假髮-官一度稱若不喜歡就扔進垃圾桶任事務律師&quot;&gt;辯方大狀未戴好假髮 官一度稱若不喜歡就扔進垃圾桶任事務律師&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方覆問時，法官陳慶偉一度打斷，要求其中一名辯方大律師戴好假髮，又指留意到不少新大狀在庭上從不留意他們的衣着。李運騰和陳仲衡均指，戴假髮應遮蓋前額的頭髮，陳慶偉並指，若該名大狀不喜歡假髮，可以將之扔進垃圾桶並轉任事務律師（“If you don’t like the wig, chuck it in the bin and become a solicitor.”）臨散庭前，陳仲衡再次提醒該名大律師戴好假髮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;港島會議改一人投一票-惟協議最終版本仍顯示一人投四票&quot;&gt;港島會議改一人投一票 惟協議最終版本仍顯示一人投四票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就彭卓棋代表大狀盧敏儀今早就控方新呈文件的補問，區確認港島區原本協議一人投4票，惟因投票程式技術問題，至5月19日的第三次協調會議「無奈接受」改為一人投一票。盧敏儀展示控方新擷取，由戴耀廷於6月8日發出的港島區協議「final」檔案「35+立會過半計劃 民主派港島區協調機制協議」，當中提及「以全票制選出他支持的四張名單」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀問，上述內容是否不反映第三次會議達成的共識，戴耀廷不知為何搞錯了。區同意，並確認6月9日記者會上他及戴均提及港島是一人投一票。盧續指，與會者被通知要改為投一票，但文件卻寫投4票，他們會非常疑惑和困惑，惟法官李運騰打斷指區不能代他人回答，改問區收到文件時有否發現與會上共識不同，區答「我唔知道，冇留意到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡提及文件第3點，指有意參與協調者可在5月中表明查詢，指文件似乎於5月前準備。區指不肯定，因文件不斷更新，但若核對初稿也無變化便可說於5月中前準備。盧續問，戴耀廷是否從沒提及有人對該點有疑問？區指戴「冇特別講」，並指二人均有出席第三次會議，理論上二人對港島一直想投4票的認知是相近，區本人也沒收到相關提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;協議稱名單不多於3人-惟彭卓棋名單有4人-辯方指彭故意不遵從共識&quot;&gt;協議稱名單不多於3人 惟彭卓棋名單有4人 辯方指彭故意不遵從共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀其後同時展示初稿和最終版本港島協議，均提及「選民參與的系統會以名單形式，不多於3名參選人」，區確認此條款為港島獨有。盧提及在首次港島會議，有女與會者關注她只是獨自參選，若候選人可將多人加入名單便可吸引更多選民投票，對她不公平，故與會者同意一張名單內不能多於3人。區指不記得誰提出，但記得有相關討論，而且一定是頭兩次會議內處理，亦沒有人反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧其後展示彭卓棋的提名表格，顯示其名單有4人，除他以外，還有何致宏、張嘉莉和李永財。盧遂問區是否同意，彭從初選一開始，已故意地（deliberately）不遵從共識？惟法官質疑區諾軒無法回答彭是否「故意」，區亦表示「我冇辦法知道」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰遂問盧，其案情是否彭卓棋「故意」不遵從共識，盧指案情是彭沒有遵從，惟陳仲衡指盧提及「故意」一詞，是問題的關鍵，又指若她無此意，問這樣的問題是很危險，盧最後同意這是其案情。區最後在法官詢問下，表示知道彭名單有4人，但「我哋唔為意呢個係一個問題」，當時亦沒有任何行動，並解釋初選出線只會計算頭四名的名單，而非個人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第31天。區諾軒繼續接受盤問，重申初選文件無提戴耀廷「攬炒十步」亦無要求參加者支持「攬炒」，而他認同否決預算案致特首下台造成「憲制危機」，但不想將「攬炒」與《基本法》中否決財案致解散立法會的機制「混為一談」，強調當時真誠地認為戴耀廷想法「同我哋成班人搞初選無干」。戴曾形容立會過半否決權是「大殺傷力憲制武器」，法官陳慶偉一度指「大殺傷力武器」概念最早於20多年前出現，美國以此為由入侵伊拉克和推翻其政府，惟區稱沒想到該歷史背景，認為該說法只是戴對使用憲制權力的論述框架和包裝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦展示提名表格，法官陳仲衡關注參選人須聲明無因相關法例喪失參選或當選資格。區指知道有參選人曾被DQ，但他作為初選舉辦者「都可以叫係『打開門口做生意』」。陳仲衡一度質疑條款是否「window dressing measure（整色整水）」，區同意是採用「誠實制度」，又認為民主要素包括參選和被選權，「我哋冇諗過去DQ曾經被政府DQ嘅人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區重申初選文件無攬炒十步無要求參加者支持攬炒&quot;&gt;區重申初選文件無「攬炒十步」、無要求參加者支持「攬炒」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒繼續接受代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑盤問。陳世傑就「攬炒」發問，區同意，認為戴耀廷的「攬炒」概念整體而言是瘋狂。陳問「攬炒」是否與「35+」無關？區指雖然「攬炒」是戴的個人立場，但文章內容的確提及到初選的情況。此時法官陳慶偉表示，不太能理解辯方問題，指若無法達成「35+」，攬炒很大程度是幻想；李運騰亦指，本案控罪不是「35+」，而是「串謀顛覆」，而法庭不是要裁定被告是否「35+」參與者，而是有否同意顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑澄清問題，指「攬炒」的概念並非「35+計劃」的協議，區答：「我講過好多次，喺所有嘅初選文件入面，都冇話參加者要支持攬炒，或者有攬炒十部曲嘅內容喺入面。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指攬炒為攬住一齊死你燒我我燒你&quot;&gt;官指攬炒為「攬住一齊死」、「你燒我我燒你」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒曾在初選翌日出席電台節目，表示戴耀廷攬炒文章應與初選分開審視，陳世傑續問區認為「攬炒」的概念是否應與「35+計劃」分開審視？主控周天行指概念空泛（generic），望辯方澄清，陳慶偉亦問陳是要談及全部「攬炒十步」抑或其中一步，陳回應是「攬炒」的廣泛概念，視乎區諾軒如何定義，基本上即是「你做了傷害我的事，我就拖你落水（drag you down）」。陳慶偉則以中文指出，可以是「攬住一齊死」或「你燒我我燒你」，但認為大家都知道概念的廣義意思，沒有需要問證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑重申想問以區對「攬炒」的理解，是否認為應與「35+計劃」分開，陳慶偉則指區已多次提及，答案視乎背景，並非簡單的「yes」或「no」，而「攬炒」在不同時期有不同定義。李運騰亦指在戴耀廷發文前，「攬炒」只有一個相對有限的意思，但當戴發表〈真攬炒十步〉一文後，便有很不同的意思，成了一個過程（process）、一個更嚴重的問題（much serious matter）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區不想將攬炒與基本法解散立法會機制混為一談真誠認為戴看法與初選無干&quot;&gt;區不想將「攬炒」與《基本法》解散立法會機制混為一談、真誠認為戴看法與初選無干&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續問，若「35+」成功後否決兩次預算案致立法會解散，會否認為屬「攬炒」？區答：「我真係唔想將攬炒同埋呢個《基本法》嘅機制混為一談，呢篇文章係戴耀廷……」惟陳慶偉打斷指問題無關戴的文章。區續答：「我真係冇諗過呢個問題，我只係會話呢一個係造成咗香港一個好唔理想嘅後果。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再問，區會否認為兩次否決預算案致特首下台是造成「憲制危機」？區同意，李再問會否因此認為是廣義的「攬炒」？區搖頭道：「我唔想將呢個情況再引申去『攬炒』」，因為攬炒「人言人殊」，而且戴耀廷的「攬炒」是一個根據很多假設的沙盤推演，「我好想將呢一啲咁嘅概念區分開嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，區在電台節目上要求分開審視，實際上是想公眾知道些什麼？區解釋當時表達該看法，一來因為當時《國安法》已立法，「法律風險真係好高」；二來「我當時真誠地認為，呢一篇文章係戴耀廷嘅睇法，同我哋成班人搞初選無干」，並同意李運騰指，他想將「35+」與該文章分開（dissociate）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指大殺傷力武器說法源於美伊戰爭-區指沒想過視為對使用憲制權力的包裝&quot;&gt;官指「大殺傷力武器」說法源於美伊戰爭 區指沒想過、視為對使用憲制權力的包裝&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷曾提出立會過半作為「大殺傷力憲制武器」，陳慶偉續指，認為「大殺傷力武器」概念最早於逾20年前的伊拉克衝突出現，當時美國以此為由入侵伊拉克，以推翻當地政府（overthrow the government），並問戴提及該概念時，區如何理解。多名被告面露愕然，鄭達鴻發笑、鄒家成和吳政亨皺眉，亦有被告說「痴線」。區答：「我冇諗到之前嗰啲法官閣下講嘅歷史背景，我會視之為佢（戴耀廷）對於《基本法》憲制權力嘅論述框架（framing），佢對於使用呢種權力嘅一種包裝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱擁護基本法和保證效忠特區是參選及妥為當選必要條件&quot;&gt;區稱擁護《基本法》和保證效忠特區是參選及妥為當選「必要條件」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑其後就初選提名表格發問，其中第6點列明「會擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特別行政區」。陳問到區諾軒及其他組織者是否有謹慎確保加入這個條款？區同意，稱「我哋作為大會，我哋並唔想觸犯任何香港嘅法例」，又指初選期間「盡咗我哋嘅全力去防止任何犯法嘅行為發生」。區又指，若結合表格第5、6和7點來看，「我哋嘅意願，係希望參加初選嘅人都能夠妥為參與立法會選舉」，並指一個參選人能夠參選並妥為當選，「擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特別行政區」是「必要條件」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上展示表格第5、6和7點如下：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;5、我特此聲明，據我所知，我並無因《立法會條例》（第542章）第39條或任何其他法律喪失獲提名為候選人或當選之資格。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;6、我特此聲明，我會擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特別行政區。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;7、我並特此聲明，我是香港特别行政區永久性居民中的中國公民，並且沒有中華人民共和國以外國家的居留權。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續提及表格第5點，問初選參選人中有沒有人曾經被DQ？區稱以其所知有，不過他們作為初選舉辦人，「都可以叫係『打開門口做生意』。」這時被告席傳來笑聲及驚訝聲音，林卓廷無奈發笑並反問：「做生意？」區主動補充：「我知呢個比喻比較差，我意思係任何人都可以拎呢份表向我哋報名。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;提名表格須聲明不曾被dq-區承認是誠實制度沒想過按條款dq初選參選資格&quot;&gt;提名表格須聲明不曾被DQ 區承認是「誠實制度」、沒想過按條款DQ初選參選資格&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在陳仲衡詢問下確認，最終有曾被DQ者成功參加初選。陳續問，故第5點只是「整色整水（window dressing measure ）」？區指「我哋有呢個良好意願」，但收報名表時，「我哋冇諗過去DQ曾經被政府DQ嘅人」。李運騰續問，故就表格的第5、6及7點，是否沒有檢查的機制（checking mechanism）？區同意他們是使用「誠實嘅制度」，若參選人有作聲明，就不會被組織者查核。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡質疑，但組織者確實知道有人曾被DQ，區指誠實制度是要靠參與者留意條款，又強調：「我哋作為組織者，的確當時冇慎重去諗呢個問題」，因為「至少我相信民主嘅要素係包括參選權、被選權，我當時冇諗過因為呢啲條款要去取消人參與初選嘅資格」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，提名表格的第5、6及7點，是組織者自行制訂還是抄回來的？區指是趙家賢根據選舉事務處的報名表格模仿製作，是基於政府使用的真實報名表。李再問，第6點的「我會擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特別行政區」，是指擁護整個《基本法》？區同意。李追問：「即包括23條？」，區回答「係」。眾被告聞言起哄，其中林卓廷及陳志全等稱：「係囉！」，亦有人點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區重申協調會議目的非討論當選後做什麼無就運用否決權詳細討論&quot;&gt;區重申協調會議目的非討論當選後做什麼、無就運用否決權詳細討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，區同意到了2020年5月，雖然立會過半的願景清晰，但對當選後做什麼仍有分歧。陳世傑指，區早前被問到泛民主派入議會後會否一致投票時，曾表示需詳細討論，問是否指5月時需要就此作更多討論？區指當時未有需要再討論這類事情，並解釋協調會議目的並非要討論當選後在議會具體做什麼，亦沒有就運用否決權作詳細討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑再問，就運用否決權是否沒有任何協議，區指「睇你點睇共同綱領入面第二條嘅條文」，即積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案。陳一度質疑，那只是「討論的項目」，又問區是否說「共同綱領」上有運用否決權的條款，區答「我哋喺啲文件度係睇到㗎，係冇得否認㗎」，強調在以「final.docx」命名的各區共同綱領上有出現該條款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區重申新東無就否決權達共識最終對文件條款也不滿意-5月初選焦點轉變惟參與者不被諮詢&quot;&gt;區重申新東無就否決權達共識、最終對文件條款也不滿意 5月初選焦點轉變惟參與者不被諮詢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續指，但新界東並沒有就運用否決權達成共識。法官陳慶偉指所有人都知道沒有共識，改為指是在協調會議上沒有共識，但不知何故「共同綱領」上卻出現了「共識」，區同意。區亦同意辯方指，文件是由戴耀廷準備，而區本人對運用否決權條款也不滿意（not satisfied）。陳續問，故在4、5月時，戴耀廷是否主要以個人的想法來前行？區指若以戴一直發表的文章為參照，會同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又引述區早前在 Trevor Beel 盤問下稱，起初認為戴耀廷撰文是「文責自負」，但後來看到參與者有不同意見，而戴「側埋一邊」，不斷指要用否決權和發展攬炒十步觀點，認為戴在組織工作上有問題。區同意，5月時「35+計劃」的焦點有所轉變，但參與者沒有被諮詢，並被鼓勵參與初選，惟陳仲衡指，有參與者對該轉變作出回應。區答「如果佢哋真係察覺到呢個改變」，並在李運騰追問下，同意5月5日新東第二次會議就「會運用」和「會積極運用」字眼的爭論，可視為有人察覺風向轉變。但區也再次確認，會議上沒有達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PHbMeNS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第31天。區諾軒繼續接受代表鄒家成的大狀盤問，同意鄒家成因對戴耀廷稱毋須簽聲明感憤怒，故發起「墨落無悔」，以向公眾展示抗爭決心。區同意，「墨落無悔」表明「會運用」否決權，與部分選區協調文件「會積極運用」字眼有別，同意有人或想比協議「行前一步」。新界東會上就否決權字眼未達成共識，但鄒家成在「墨落無悔」卻提及「協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領」，區在法官詢問下，表示懷疑是否有他不知情的「黑盒」過程，導致「共同綱領」和鄒家成用「會運用」字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，被問到拖延法案通過是否妥善履行立會議員職責，區表示立法會議員向市民問責，會用不同手法爭取選民所想，「無論投贊成定反對、認真審議定係去到拉布，都係佢哋向市民問責嘅方式。市民唔滿意嘅，下一屆就會選走佢哋。」法官則重申，控方立場不是說否決預算案就違法，只有「無差別」否決才違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意鄒家成對戴耀廷不要求簽共同綱領感憤怒-撰墨落無悔望展抗爭決心&quot;&gt;區同意鄒家成對戴耀廷不要求簽共同綱領感憤怒 撰「墨落無悔」望展抗爭決心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒繼續接受代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑盤問。陳世傑展示鄒家成在 Facebook 上的「墨落無悔」聲明書帖文，區確認自己曾就有關聲明回應，故有一定的理解。區同意該聲明是回應戴耀廷在6月9日記者會指參選人毋須簽聲明的說法，而鄒家成對此感到憤怒，不滿經過許多努力達成共同綱領後，卻沒有任何文件，於是發起「墨落無悔」，表達參選人需要簽署某些文件，以向公眾展示他們有抗爭的決心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nZHf5OW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ （鄒家成 Facebook Post 圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，該聲明的內容只是重複戴曾說的話，並無加插新的內容。惟法官李運騰指，鄒其實是想讓公眾知道戴沒有在會上說的話，因戴在會上沒有交代所達成的協議，區同意「呢個都係個分別」。區亦同意，「墨落無悔」無提及「無差別」否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指墨落無悔與部分選區共同綱領有別-使用會運用字眼較堅定&quot;&gt;區指「墨落無悔」與部分選區「共同綱領」有別 使用「會運用」字眼較堅定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，簽署聲明的人來自各個選區。李運騰續問，「墨落無悔」上的兩點聲明，與協調會議達成的協議是否相符？該兩點分別為認同「五大訴求 缺一不可」，「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」；以及「若支持度跌出各區預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」。區指第二點相符，但第一點卻不同，舉例聲明發起人之一的梁晃維是香港島候選人，但港島「共同綱領」是使用「會積極運用」而非「會運用」字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續問，那「共同綱領」（「會積極運用」）還是「墨落無悔」（「會運用」）使用的字眼意思較強？區指是後者，因為根據協調會議過程「『會運用』字眼係比較堅定」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續提及，區曾表示「會運用」否決權包含3個意思，包括視乎內容而用、為爭取五大訴求而用，及「無差別」地使用，而「墨落無悔」指的是第二個情景，區同意。區亦同意，聲明僅為「確保抗爭陣營參選人，有最基本的抗爭意志」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;新東無共識惟墨落無悔稱已取得共識-區懷疑有黑盒過程導致&quot;&gt;新東無共識惟「墨落無悔」稱「已取得共識」 區懷疑有「黑盒過程」導致&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰亦指出，聲明提及「我們認為，在初選協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領，乃一眾參選人之合作基礎」，似乎鄒是在提及會議上已達成的共識，區同意有這個意思。李追問，區曾指在新東所有協調會議後，就「會運用」或「會積極運用」否決權的字眼未有達成共識，但鄒卻似乎指已達成共識，究竟當時會上有否共識，抑或鄒是比起本來的共識「行前一步（went further）」？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區表示：「所以我嘅睇法係，喺當日嘅協調會議後，係咪有一個『黑盒』，就係有一個過程，最後係咪會導致到共同綱領或者鄒家成認為係用『會（運用）』嘅。」林卓廷一度說「吓？」，吳政亨亦用雙手掩嘴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李問區是否指發生了一些他並不知情的事？區同意，並解釋以梁晃維作為例子，是望指出有其他選區的共同綱領使用「會積極運用」字眼，但在「墨落無悔」出台後，簽署者卻表示「會運用」。李再問是否有人想比起達成的協議「行前一步」，區表示：「呢個係一個可能性」，亦同意這是個別人士的聲明，並非新界東的聲明。陳世傑續問，故聲明是否簽署者的「個人心願（personal aspiration）」？惟主控周天行反對指證人無法回答這個問題，法官亦指應留待陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指鄒家成會上向戴耀廷指議員一係投一係唔投-區指與其憶述有出入&quot;&gt;辯方指鄒家成會上向戴耀廷指議員「一係投，一係唔投」 區指與其憶述有出入&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒其後確認，在5月5日新東第二次協調會議上，鄒家成對戴耀廷提出使用「會積極運用」否決權的字眼有爭議。陳世傑指，當時鄒是表明否決權是由《基本法》所賦予，惟區指無法憶述到更多，但認為談及否決權時「必然係講緊《基本法》嘅權力」。陳再指，鄒其實是說議員在《基本法》下，「一係投，一係唔投（you either vote, or you don’t vote）」，區指「可以咁理解」。陳再指，鄒是想說，為何要用「會積極運用」這麼一個無說服力（lame）的用詞，應該更加肯定才對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時主控萬德豪起身，認為應問證人是否記得鄒曾這樣說過，而不是問對鄒想法的意見。陳慶偉要求區避席，指辯方有權指出案情，但認為根據新東會議的背景，鄒家成並非只提及可運用《基本法》權力，而是不同意「會積極運用」的字眼。陳世傑解釋，他想指出鄒曾在會上向戴指其用字不夠肯定，指作為議員「一係投一係唔投」，認為區在會上會對相關對話有認知。陳慶偉同意，但指區不能讀取鄒的思想，着他只問鄒家成曾否向戴提及相關說法，但就不要提及《基本法》權力的部分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒入庭後，陳世傑問，鄒成家在會上曾否向戴耀廷指「一係投，一係唔投」，區指與他憶述的句子有出入，重申鄒當時是質疑戴耀廷「點解係用『積極』而唔係用『會』，係咁多」，鄒家成發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問及逃犯條例條訂草案-區指法案委員會一片混亂&quot;&gt;辯方問及《逃犯條例》條訂草案 區指法案委員會一片混亂&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續就否決權發問，問泛民過往是否曾「否決（vetoing the budget）預算案」，惟法官李運騰指這與「反對（vote against）」預算案有分別，指過往泛民「反對」預算案，但因非議會多數，並不能「否決（veto）」預算案。區同意，如果有35名議員「團結一致否決預算案」，就是「veto」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續問及，區作為立法會議員時，是否曾就《逃犯條例》條訂草案投棄權票。區指他是反對《逃犯條例》，並投下反對票。李運騰問，當時是否曾就草案投票，抑或已被政府撤回？此時陳志全搖頭，被告席內亦有人討論。區回應政府於2019年10月宣布撤回，而草案曾進入法案委員會。李問有否進行首讀，區指「希望我冇搞錯，應該係」，但沒有上到大會和去到二讀，亦沒有表決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，他是反對該草案。被問如何反對，他指「我哋喺法案委員會不斷提出質疑」，又指「喺嗰個委員會入面一路都係一片混亂嘅，石禮謙好想入嚟，想入個議會，我哋民主派議員全力阻止」，多人發笑。林卓廷說：「大佬呀，我要打官司……」，並一度舉手，並湊近被告欄向律師說話。李運騰續問當時是否有舉行會議，區指當時「出咗一個叫『鬧雙胞委員會』」，陳慶偉指不需深究，李運騰亦指只望澄清當時雖沒有表決，但很多人已表達反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指立會議員向市民問責-無論投贊成或反對認真審議或拉布均是問責方式&quot;&gt;區指立會議員向市民問責 無論投贊成或反對、認真審議或拉布均是問責方式&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問，投票或不投票是否立法會議員的職責，區同意，但亦同意李運騰指，有議員是在議會製造各種麻煩，不希望會議舉行。區也同意，投票或不投票，及拖延法案通過都是議員的「權力」，陳世傑續問拖延法案是否妥善履行立會議員職責？惟陳慶偉質疑《基本法》沒列明議員有權拖延法案，區同意《基本法》沒列明，只列明投票的權力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，因此用「策略（tactics）」而非「權力」一詞會較合適？區指「立法會議員都係向市民問責嘅」，他們會用不同手法望爭取選民所希望的，「無論投贊成定反對、認真審議定係去到拉布，都係佢哋向市民問責嘅方式。市民唔滿意嘅，下一屆就會選走佢哋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方引林鄭稱否決議案是發揮憲制功能-惟官控方指控無差別否決才犯法&quot;&gt;辯方引林鄭稱否決議案是發揮憲制功能 惟官控方指控「無差別」否決才犯法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑其後引2016年7月時任政務司司長林鄭月娥會見傳媒的新聞稿，林鄭曾提及「條例草案或者我們的一些撥款項目提交了給立法會，但不幸被否決，這個我們接受的，這個結果我們是接受的，因為這是立法會發揮它憲制功能的一部分」，又指有關變性人的《2014年婚姻（修訂）條例草案》在社會和立法會引起很大爭議，故被否決，「這也是民主過程的一部分，所以特區政府是接受這個結果。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑問會否影響區對於否決權合法性的看法，惟法官陳仲衡指，不認為控方是指否決本身的行為是不合法，而是「無差別」否決才犯法，周天行同意。李運騰亦重申，控方已在開案陳詞和控罪清楚說明，只有當不考慮議案優劣，無差別否決議案，濫用立法會議員職權才是違法。陳遂沒有再繼續發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意特首下台和解散立會非其目的不關心任何人當選後工作計劃&quot;&gt;區同意特首下台和解散立會非其目的、不關心任何人當選後工作計劃&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑最後向區指出，「35+」從來不是關乎無差別否決預算案，區稱「要睇參與者點樣睇35+計劃」，陳再指，但根據組織者，這並非最初的目的？區指對他來說「一直都係揀選民主派代表進入立法會」。法官李運騰指，辯方將「組織者」當為一個整體，但區未必能代其他人回答，區附和「我只能代表我嚟作答」，重申他認為「35+」目標是為民主派爭取最大勝算。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑再指，「35+」並非要特首下台和解散立法會，區同意這並非他的目的，陳再指，「35+」並沒有預期參選人當選後不應做應有的職責，區答「我唔關心任何人當選立法會之後嘅工作計劃」，陳世傑遂表示完成盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官就九西第二次會議發問-區認無法區分出席者&quot;&gt;官就九西第二次會議發問 區認無法區分出席者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，法官李運騰詢問4月29日第二次九西協調會議上，提及戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步〉一文的詳情，當天是文章發布翌日。區笑言，「我真係諗唔起點解無啦啦會提起呢樣嘢」，只記得會議開始不久，類似是戴耀廷在介紹某些說法時，「張崑陽就話睇咗佢近日嘅攬炒十部曲文章」，其後戴就文章解釋，岑子杰並提出反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李問除了區、戴、岑和張外，當天還有誰在場？區略顯猶豫，指記得參與初選的人都有親身或派代表出席，但劉偉聰曾指他其實沒出席第二次會議，區承認「我係區分唔到嘅」，因他在錄影會面憶述兩次會議出席者都屬「總體的印象」，「所以我有記錯係唔奇嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/u4j6qVI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第31天。區諾軒今接受代表柯耀林的大狀盤問，同意柯可被歸類為溫和民主派、亦非知名政治人物，被問到柯在新東初選得票不足1%是否因不夠激進，區指「攞得多票唔一定激進先得」，但同意柯並不激進；而對辯方指協調會議上參選人互相攻擊，但柯一言不發，區同意「柯先生係好沉默嘅」。辯方亦指出，民主選舉候選人常擺出「政治姿態」，但實際上無意實踐其主張，而柯簽「墨落無悔」是避免被攻擊，惟法官質疑區無法回答，辯方遂沒有繼續發問。審訊下周一（27日）繼續，控方透露另一控方證人趙家賢將作供，屆時他需先在庭上閱覽約8千頁的文件證物。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指認識柯耀林多年-他離開民主黨後成立區政聯盟-主要關注地區議題&quot;&gt;區指認識柯耀林多年 他離開民主黨後成立「區政聯盟」 主要關注地區議題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;下午由代表柯耀林的大律師葉海琅盤問區諾軒。西九龍法院附近的長沙灣潤發倉庫今發生三級火，葉甫站起就表示「附近有火警」，法官聞言發笑，陳慶偉笑言：「你想參與救火嗎？（“Do you wanna join the fire service?”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於盤問下，區指認識柯耀林多年，柯曾為民主黨成員，於2018年與部分成員離開民主黨，並在2019年5月與部分離開的成員成立「區政聯盟」，組織內有不同政治組織，包括「將軍澳民生關注組」、區政聯盟大埔團隊、北區團隊，以及「沙田區政」。區知道柯是屬於「將軍澳民生關注組」，亦得知組織內各人有不一致的政治立場，而各組織並不能互相代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，區政聯盟關注地區議題，多於影響全港的政治議題包括普選，其主要成員是區議員及地區工作者，並沒有立會議員，在初選期間亦主要關心地區事務。法官李運騰問到，柯是以個人身分抑或代表將軍澳民生關注組參選，區指柯代表區政聯盟參選。葉其後展示柯的提名表格，政治聯繫一欄顯示為「區政聯盟」，但李運騰質疑表格上無列明他是否代表區政聯盟參選；區回應指：「參選表格畀佢哋寫政治聯繫，我會視之為佢係代表該組織參選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區不知柯有否與戴耀廷見面討論初選&quot;&gt;區不知柯有否與戴耀廷見面討論初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡追問，初選中不只將軍澳的選民可投票予柯，新界東所有選民均可以，區同意。葉海琅其後指，雖然柯的政治聯繫是區政聯盟，但並非指他代表該組織參選，因他並沒有得到區政聯盟所有組織的同意（authorised），區表示：「我冇關心當時柯先生有幾代表區政聯盟。」葉續指，戴耀廷曾於2020年2月至3月與區政聯盟見面討論初選，但柯耀林並無出席，區表示不知道戴與甚麼人見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指柯首次會議中途離開-傳譯主任錯譯left為slept多人大笑&quot;&gt;辯方指柯首次會議中途離開 傳譯主任錯譯「left」為「slept」多人大笑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉海琅續指，同年4月14日的新東第一次協調會議，區政聯盟共4名成員出席，包括柯耀林、大埔區的區鎮樺、沙田區政的李永成及丁仕元。葉問區是否知道這麼多成員出席協調會，是因他們尚未決定多少人或誰代表參選，區指不清楚原因，他們亦無提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉續指，在協調會議上，參選人的討論主要關於私人恩怨的人身攻擊。法官陳仲衡追問會議歷時多久，區指兩小時，陳疑惑：「兩小時的人身攻擊？」李運騰續問區，在會議上是否有很多人身攻擊，區表示應該有，但笑言「真係唔記得具體係咩嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉指出，柯在會議上一言不發，區指：「就我憶述，柯先生係好沉默嘅。」葉再問，區是否記得柯在會議中途離開，這時法庭傳譯主任將「left（離開）」聽錯為「slept（睡覺）」，並錯譯為：「記唔記得佢瞓著咗？」，引起眾被告包括柯耀林和旁聽人士大笑，法官陳慶偉亦哈哈大笑，區諾軒亦笑到彎身指「我唔記得……」，傳譯主任則道歉稱：「Sorry.」最後區表示不記得柯有否在會議中途離開。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指柯因西貢區議會開會無出席第二次協調會-區稱與憶述有出入&quot;&gt;辯方指柯因西貢區議會開會無出席第二次協調會 區稱與憶述有出入&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉海琅其後就新東5月5日的第二次協調會議發問，區確認會議於晚上7時至9時，在教協位於旺角中僑商業大廈的會址舉行。葉呈上同日西貢區議會的會議記錄，列明出席者及出席和離開的時間，當中顯示柯耀林於早上約9時半出席會議，最後在晚上10時40分離開。李運騰打斷指這屬於傳聞證供，除非有人就此作證，否則不能作為柯沒出席的證據；加上區並無出席此會議，並沒有資格回答，但若這是辯方案情，可直接指出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉遂直接向區指出，柯沒有出席第二次協調會議，是因為他正出席區議會的會議。區表示：「同我憶述係有出入嘅。」至於同樣有出席該次區議會會議的范國威，區確認他沒有出席第二次協調會議。此時柯耀林聳肩。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意柯耀林為溫和民主派印象中並不激進-得票少於1&quot;&gt;區同意柯耀林為「溫和」民主派、印象中並不激進 得票少於1%&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉海琅其後展示柯耀林的提名表格，其選舉單張顯示「重整香港 港人至上」，葉指出其政綱並無提及「攬炒」的概念和否決財政預算案。葉續指，柯可被歸類為「溫和（mild）」的民主派，區回答：「就我多年對佢嘅認識，我同意。」葉亦指出，柯並非知名度高的政治人物，因他在初選中落敗，只獲1,489票，少於整體的1%，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉追問，柯得票少並落敗的原因是他並不夠激進？惟法官陳仲衡質疑，區無法代不投票予柯的人回答。法官陳慶偉則建議葉可轉用另一方式提問，指柯未能獲得足夠選票，是否可能因為他不夠激進？區表示：「攞得多票唔一定要激進先得嘅，不過就我對佢喺初選裡面嘅印象，佢並不激進。」林卓廷一度說「係囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意簽墨落無悔是以防參選人開空頭支票的措施&quot;&gt;區同意簽「墨落無悔」是以防參選人開「空頭支票」的措施&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉海琅亦問，即使取得立會過半，兩次否決預算案致特首下台的謀劃是否極之不可能實現？法官一度質疑相關問題已出現過很多次，區則回應：「我會話係基於好多前設先至去到最後呢一步嘅，換言之有唔少困難。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉其後問區，是否同意在民主選舉，候選人常擺出「政治姿態（political postures）」，但實際上無意實踐其主張（without any real intention to achieve）？法官陳慶偉質疑是否指柯說謊，並認為可改問：「參選人當選後，是否仍可能有很多因素影響他實踐政綱？」區同意。陳仲衡續問，故簽署「墨落無悔」是一項以防參選人開「空頭支票（empty promises）」的措施？區稱「可以咁講」。彭卓棋發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指柯耀林簽墨落或是政治姿態免被攻擊-官稱證人無法回答&quot;&gt;辯方指柯耀林簽「墨落」或是「政治姿態」、免被攻擊 官稱證人無法回答&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉續問區，柯耀林簽署「墨落無悔」有沒有可能只是一種「政治姿態」，以避免被人攻擊。但李運騰質疑區只能「揣測」，除非辯方是想指出區知道柯耀林沒有意圖實踐其政綱，指應留待陳詞交代。葉一度欲問其他參選人為何簽署，但法官再質疑區無法得知，且「墨落無悔」亦非大會文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉表示這是最後一條問題，陳慶偉反駁：「就算是最後一條問題，都要有技巧地問（“… you still have to ask in a skillful way.”）」，多名被告和律師發笑，林卓廷亦大笑。葉最終改問，「據你理解，是否同意有部份溫和民主派簽署『墨落無悔』，是不想讓選民以為……」，惟即被陳慶偉打斷，指問題並不好，李運騰亦指這太過揣測。陳慶偉最後無奈表示：「Listen, Mr. Cheung (應為 Mr. Yip). I need a break.」，多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢將於下周作供-需在庭上閱覽8千頁文件證物&quot;&gt;趙家賢將於下周作供 需在庭上閱覽8千頁文件證物&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;休庭之後，葉海琅表示沒有進一步提問，鄒家成一度面露驚訝張開嘴。代表李予信的大律師關文渭亦表示，將不會對區諾軒進行盤問。區諾軒離庭時，向法官、控方及旁聽席三個方向分別鞠躬三次。現時所有被告盤問完畢，尚餘代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀因控方新呈文件有少量問題補問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪續指，控方覆問預計約2小時，第二名控方證人趙家賢將於下周作供；而因為沒有一份所有被告均同意的同意事實，故需透過趙家賢將約8千頁文件證物呈堂，他需檢視全部8千頁文件。法庭原定下周一下午休庭，控方提議安排趙於該段時間在庭上以電腦閱覽，李運騰指需要超過半天，但萬表示只需少於兩小時。陳仲衡一度問萬：「你可以在兩小時內閱讀8千頁文件嗎？」萬回應若他熟悉該些文件是可以的。法官陳慶偉終批准申請，指屆時法官將不會到庭，只會派書記在場，而各辯方大律師及被告則可自行選擇是否到庭，並不得和趙家賢交談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">區諾軒：不想將「攬炒」與《基本法》解散立會機制混為一談、真誠認為戴耀廷看法與初選無干 區諾軒指鄒家成發起「墨落無悔」稱「已取得共識」 或涉他不知的「黑盒過程」 區諾軒同意柯耀林屬溫和民主派並不激進 料趙家賢下周一出庭</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第三十日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-23-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-30.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第三十日】" /><published>2023-03-23T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-03-23T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-30</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-23-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-30.html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9gjAYu4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（23日）踏入審訊第30天。區諾軒今繼續接受代表何桂藍的大狀盤問，就有參選人簽署「墨落無悔」聲明書，區指雖有保留但尊重，認為屬各人自由，但同意簽聲明可謂「內鬥」和綑綁他人，可以的話寧願沒有該份聲明，但同意即使無聲明，DQ的風險一開始已存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區又同意，發起「35+」初衷是不想浪費選票，並強調不是要推銷或販賣希望，因《國安法》落實、亦可能出現DQ，民主派或未能取得過半議席，同意謀劃可能會「失敗」。辯方問，故最後「35+計劃」只是一個夢？法官亦問是否「註定失敗」？區答「好難一概而論」。此外，區同意於2020年前一段時間已認識何桂藍，曾接受她訪問，同意辯方指她是「醒目的政治記者」；又同意35+計劃暫停後，各參選人做的的決定亦是「自主」的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒國安法後撰文指香港已經破局-定期選舉和高度自治受影響&quot;&gt;區諾軒《國安法》後撰文指「香港已經破局」 定期選舉和高度自治受影響&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今繼續接受代表何桂藍的大狀 Trevor Beel 提問。Beel 展示區諾軒文章〈思考後35+民主派的未來角色〉，區稱約於2020年8月撰寫，投稿《蘋果日報》刊登。文中提及「香港已經破局」，區解釋當時看到《國安法》已經通過，立法會選舉亦決定延期，他指的破局就是這意思。法官李運騰指，理解人們談及「破局」是希望達致新的局面，Beel 追問是破了什麼局？區指是「定期選舉」和「高度自治」，李運騰問即這兩樣東西已不再存在？區答：「至少受到影響啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指抗爭派政治立場未必完全統一不隸屬任何政黨&quot;&gt;區諾軒指抗爭派政治立場未必完全統一、不隸屬任何政黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒早前被法官問及「抗爭派」的意思，區以出席抗爭派記者會的人士歸類，形容他們在民主派系中站在「較進步」的位置，指「佢哋都好多元」，又指鄒家成、余慧明和何桂藍為抗爭派。Beel 問，「較進步」的意思是否「較積極（more proactive）」、「較肯定新意念（more assertive with new ideas）」？區答「立場上、行動上都有呢個意思」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 亦問及「多元」是否指「多樣化（diversity）」，區指抗爭派政治立場未必完全統一，同意 Beel 指集合了不同意見和想法的人，而出席抗爭派記者會的人並不隸屬任何政黨。Beel 其後一度提及，區諾軒2019年曾因議會上的行為而須守行為，他在法官詢問下指不是要質疑證人品格，並問區會否將自己歸類為較進步的陣營，區答：「喺我在任立法會議員期間，我都係相對喺一個進步嘅陣營裡面。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問區為袁嘉蔚助選是否支持抗爭派理念-區稱會替所有港島候選人助選&quot;&gt;官問區為袁嘉蔚助選是否支持抗爭派理念 區稱會替所有港島候選人助選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區確認，袁嘉蔚曾出席抗爭派記者會，歸類她為抗爭派，而他曾於7月為袁嘉蔚助選，何桂藍在場，在延伸庭的袁雙手掩面，其後發笑。法官陳慶偉問，這是否代表區諾軒支持袁的抗爭派理念？區指「我冇話特別支持邊個理念」，解釋因他曾任香港島立法會議員，故當時做了一個決定，即向所有參與香港島初選的候選人表示「我會公平分配時間為你哋所有人助選」，故當時他為袁助選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，袁嘉蔚有簽署「墨落無悔」，對區來說不是一個問題（not an issue）？區指「我冇關心任何人簽墨落無悔嘅簽署，呢個係各人嘅自由」，亦確認他沒有向簽署者表示任何反對，但補充曾於6月19日在 Facebook 發文回應抗爭派聲明發起人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱沒關心任何人簽墨落無悔屬各人自由-但同意屬內鬥寧願無&quot;&gt;區稱沒關心任何人簽「墨落無悔」、屬各人自由 但同意屬「內鬥」寧願無&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示該篇〈以正視聽——假如我有資格回應抗爭派立場聲明書發起人〉，區表示雖然內文對簽聲明者一些看法表達保留，但可顯示他沒有明顯反對他們立場。法官陳仲衡問，但文中提及「就不同黨派的公開回應，不見得有參與者對運用權力否決財政預算案態度保留。那大家反對的是誰？」，似乎區是同意參選人公開表達否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區引文中「就算所有人都聯署簽紙，只要有人到時反悔，除了譴責，根本無法阻止」，指當時有此說法，是尊重他們會運用否決權的動機；而他作為大會一分子，不希望人們繼續質疑大會，故指出看不到有人公開反對否決，以說服抗爭派聲明發起人。惟陳仲衡再指，若區只是尊重他們想法，不會說出「若35+攬炒，否決預算案重要」。區解釋該句是指若發起聲明者相信35+是為了「攬炒」、否決預算案是重要議題，就應該落力宣傳，文中亦有提及「參與者間繼續夾到出血，效益很少」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問他是否暗示「墨落無悔」是參與者的「內鬥」、一派嘗試綑綁其他人？區同意，鄒家成一度發笑。李再問，故可以的話，區會寧願沒有「墨落無悔」？區答「可以咁講」，並表示當日在組織者群組曾指「就算講否決預算案都好啦，係有一個詮釋嘅空間」，但若「不斷去叫人表態」，「就會將一種模糊性收窄」。Beel 續問，區諾軒本人是否不反對在立會過半後，以否決預算案作為談判籌碼？區指「我冇特別關心用唔用否決權嘅問題」，但「立會過半增加與政府談判的籌碼」是他的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官引區文章稱對大局為重投黃成智感羞恥指35初心是不浪費選票&quot;&gt;官引區文章稱對大局為重投黃成智感「羞恥」、指35+初心是不浪費選票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在李運騰提議下，庭上其後展示區6月9日在 Facebook 發布的〈人與人最可貴的 是建立制度 - 發起35+的初衷〉一文，區確認於同日的初選記者會後發布。陳慶偉問文章是否反映區參與「35+」的初心？區指文章用了很多主觀詞語，但主體想法沒有離開其初衷，並引文中「這是我發起35+協調的理由」及「失望是源自明明有過半數民意，多區卻太多人參選，分拆選票，得不到該正確反映的議席數」，區同意其初心包括不浪費選票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續問及文中「過了那麼多年，也為第一票是投給黃成智感到羞恥」一句，多名被告和旁聽人士發笑。區笑指「其實我都唔係好想令到佢尷尬㗎」，解釋他成年後投下的第一票，是2008年立法會選舉投給當時屬民主黨的黃成智。而他後來加入民主黨曾與黃共事數年，「我一時記唔起當時候佢做咗啲咩嘢，但係到最後佢係離開咗民主黨」，此時在旁聽席的民主黨劉慧卿笑說「唔係離開，係踢走」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，他稱覺得羞恥是因為「我唔認同佢嘅政治立場」，但當年投票給他是因「大局為重」。李運騰問，故區的想法是即使他不喜歡某個候選人，但仍會因想民主派爭取最多議席而投給他？區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱沒反對戴耀廷用會積極運用字眼-因認為範圍與講到好盡有差距&quot;&gt;區稱沒反對戴耀廷用「會積極運用」字眼 因認為範圍與「講到好盡」有差距&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續問，這是否也是區在6月9日後，沒有對戴耀廷指立會過半是「大殺傷力憲制武器」的說法表示反對的原因？區稱「可以咁講」。陳續指，區曾指當天是他與戴想法出現分歧的分界線，而當天記者會上沒有特別事情發生，問區是否為了在立會選舉爭取最多議席，故沒有反對戴的想法？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指「我要小心啲講戴耀廷嘅諗法係乜」，又望解釋當時他的認知，惟陳慶偉打斷，指理解區的想法是認為按《基本法》權力否決預算案沒有錯，區同意。陳續問，因此區當時同意戴的想法？區指當時認同「積極運用基本法權力」的字眼，是因他察悉到不同參與者有一個「政治立場的範圍」，「我相信呢個維度呢，呢個 spectrum，係同戴耀廷去講到件事係好盡嘅，係有差距嘅」，又指「我同佢（戴耀廷）合作都係事實」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後問及，若區認為運用《基本法》的否決權沒問題，故使用「會運用」或「會積極運用」字眼並不重要？區答：「喺《國安法》立法之前，的確冇為意到會係一個問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指不想推銷或販賣希望-同意國安法及dq下35或失敗&quot;&gt;區指不想推銷或販賣希望 同意《國安法》及DQ下「35+」或失敗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文中另提及「而從來，從來不見得有甚麼希望好賣。給你35+，國安法猶存，議會仍然可以DQ、不承認當選」，Beel 問「議會仍然可以DQ、不承認當選」有何意思。區指當時提「35+」，「都唔係話一啲好好推銷嘅希望」，李運騰問是否不想給予社會假希望，區指「我會話唔係去賣一啲希望」，因當時《國安法》立法，議員亦可能被DQ。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再問，因此區宣傳「35+」不是想帶來美好願望，而是前方仍有困難？區同意，指簡單來說，若真的出現DQ，「民主派好有可能去到新一屆立法會係唔夠35個議員」，同意李運騰指謀劃因此可能「失敗」。陳仲衡指，不過該段最後也有提及即使如此，「在九月贏最好的仗」，區同意是指立法會選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱dq風險一開始已存在-以黃之鋒為例指無墨落無悔亦可因政治聯繫無法入閘&quot;&gt;區稱DQ風險一開始已存在 以黃之鋒為例指無「墨落無悔」亦可因政治聯繫無法入閘&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，區發文時雖望盡力達成35+，但他其實意識到這是難以實現的？陳慶偉則指，當時一定有現實的前景，否則他們怎會搞初選？區其後同意，他撰文時對35+計劃能成功有疑問，並指是由「墨落無悔」發布後開始出現，但法官質疑他撰文時「墨落無悔」並未發布。區遂改稱撰文時《國安法》將立法，即使未有聲明也認為DQ的「風險一開始已經存在」，會設想某些候選人因政治聯繫無法參選。他舉例，黃之鋒「之前一路都冇得入閘」，據政府以往做法估計是因為他是香港眾志成員，故會預期參與九東初選的他「好難通過到個審查」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/37oeb7u.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，在「墨落無悔」發出前，並沒有聽過參與者要求簽署聲明。法官陳仲衡問該聲明對他來說是否很出奇？區指因「墨落無悔」是公開聲明，並指他現時也無法確定指候選人或被DQ的輿論，是在6月9日記者會後或聲明發出後出現。區並補充，若說令計劃出現無法執行的問題，要視乎6月中後輿論有多大程度指出候選人有DQ風險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;35是否只是一個夢註定失敗-區好難一概而論&quot;&gt;35+是否只是一個夢、註定失敗？ 區：好難一概而論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，DQ是達致35+的障礙。Beel 問，如果在功能組別不能取得足夠議席，就不能得到足夠票數否決預算案？區指有兩個層面，包括民主黨有否足夠人參選功能組別，以及參選功能組別者抱持什麼立場，因如他早前所述，大部分民主派功能組別參選人「都冇話要否決財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，故最後「35+計劃」只是一個夢（“In the end the 35+ scheme was just a dream?”）？並不會發生？李運騰亦補充，即區知道35+是註定失敗（bound to fail）？區答「好難一概而論」，Beel 一度再追問那據他個人的感覺如何？惟陳慶偉指「Thank you, thank you」，李運騰亦指可留待陳詞，Beel 終沒有繼續發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意2020年前已認識何桂藍-此前曾接受何訪問&quot;&gt;區同意2020年前已認識何桂藍 此前曾接受何訪問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，於2020年前已認識任記者的何桂藍，此前也看過其文章。Beel 問據其文章，她是否一名「醒目的政治記者（astute political journalist）」，傳譯主任一度未能譯出「astute」，Beel 以帶口音的廣東話說「醒目」，多人發笑，區答「可以咁講」。區亦指，記得在2020年前何桂藍曾訪問他，但他不記得是哪篇訪問，Beel 提出是2015年區任區議員時，區指「有可能」，同意在2020年前一段時間已認識他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意戴耀廷是計劃領袖曾指區議會主席是協調會議公證人&quot;&gt;區同意戴耀廷是計劃領袖、曾指區議會主席是協調會議公證人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉亦就不同議題發問。陳指根據記者會片段，似乎計劃的領袖是戴耀廷，而涉案文章大部分也是由戴撰寫，區同意，亦同意他是被李卓人和李永達邀請擔任初選的協調者。陳續問，區會否視其謀劃中的角色與趙家賢相似？區答「相若，不過我哋負責嘅嘢始終唔同」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉又問及，初選記者會上曾有區議會主席出席，問他們在35+的角色是什麼，是組織者一部分，抑或角色較有限？區指「我理解就好有限嘅」，並指記者會上戴耀廷曾提及協調會議過程有區議會主席見證，「當有一日唔同嘅與會者有異議，咁佢哋就會作為一個公證人講返會議係乜嘢嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意35暫緩後各人決定為自主&quot;&gt;區同意35+暫緩後各人決定為「自主」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在陳慶偉詢問下亦同意，初選後數名組織者曾在 Facebook 公開宣布35+計劃暫緩。陳問計劃暫緩後，是否代表初選參與者已不再受他們簽過的聲明或共同綱領所約束？區答「呢個係我嘅睇法」。陳再指，因此在初選落敗的楊雪盈也會報名參選立法會，區指「或者廣泛啲嚟睇，當大會唔再運作，大家跟住做嘅決定，係自主嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒主動釐清預算案議事程序-確認任議員所提修正案全遭否決&quot;&gt;區諾軒主動釐清預算案議事程序 確認任議員所提修正案全遭否決&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，區諾軒昨被問及財政預算案議事程序，提及撥款條例草案先交草案委員會，其後財委會召開特別會議討論，議員可提出修正案。區今甫開庭主動就相關議事程序作釐清，指財務委員會舉行特別會議時，議員負責書面質詢政府，至於昨天提及的修正案則是在立法會二讀後的全體委員會審議階段表決，最後到三讀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，相關程序是否基於區諾軒對議事規則的理解，如想知道確實程序便要參考規則，區同意，並笑稱「我還柙兩年，都係盡力記得返我之前所經歷嘅議事程序」。Beel 其後指，區在2018年任立法會議員期間，曾就撥款條例草案提出約60個修正案，主席只接納其中14個作表決，區指不記得實際提出多少，但數字與他記憶類近，並確認他提出的修正案全部因分組點票而無法通過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區確認新東無就會運用或會積極運用否決權字眼達成共識&quot;&gt;區確認新東無就「會運用」或「會積極運用」否決權字眼達成共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒又確認，有出席新東4月14日和5月5日的兩次會議，首次會議主要談及協調機制，至少以取得6席為目標，但對最後派出6席抑或7席參選未達成共識，「留咗呢個尾巴。」區亦同意第二次會議就協調文件用「會運用」抑或「會積極運用」的字眼作討論，但沒有達成共識。Beel 續指，參與者是否對否決預算案沒有明確立場？區指他所憶述不同參與者的立場已在早前作供「講晒啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區亦確認新東曾於6月28日舉行選舉論壇，並同意自己出席過大部分論壇，只有一至兩次沒出席，但對出席了哪幾次已無印象。Beel 問區是否論壇組織者，區指「我幾乎係全盤負責」，並同意辦論壇目的是讓候選人表達自己的使命宣言（mission statement），令人投票予他們。Beel 問及，論壇上所有候選人唯一一致的訊息，是否鼓勵人們出來投票？區指「我冇特別計過邊個講、邊個冇講」，李運騰指區不肯定有否出席該論壇，不認為其證據有比重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法庭因咪高峰問題休庭逾一小時&quot;&gt;法庭因咪高峰問題休庭逾一小時&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，早上開庭後近一小時，法庭的音響系統出現問題，部分咪一度發出嘈雜聲音。法官提醒毋須發言的大律師關掉咪。其後於盤問期間，有咪再次發出更嘈雜的聲音，甚至覆蓋法官的說話，最後法官陳慶偉於10時41分下令休庭予職員維修。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;休庭期間，有兩名技術人員嘗試修理，更換部分放在律師桌上的咪高峰，又一度翻查說明書，Beel 一度笑說「我們找到元兇了（“We found the culprit.”）」。有職員於11時15分指將開庭，惟咪高峰再傳出雜音，職員於11時26分指將於12時開庭，終於12時10分開庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（23日）踏入審訊第30天。區諾軒今開始接受代表鄒家成的大狀盤問，重申「35+」主要目標僅立會過半，非令政權倒台，「冇諗過亦都唔想犯法。」區同意各區就否決財政預算案沒有達成共識，惟戴仍將相關條款加入協調文件，法官李運騰聞言指戴挺「硬銷」，區同意「係幾硬銷」，惟被問到文件是否非參與者共識，區則指「大家可能有分歧，我哋好難一刀切話嗰樣嘢係 yes or no」。辯方提出，戴耀廷發出相關協調文件只是「邀請各人同意」，惟區指該文件沒列明是「邀請函」；但區同意，新西參選人最終簽署協議並夾附在提名表格，是個人對於協調文件的「回應」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區重申35目標僅立會過半非令政權倒台冇諗過亦都唔想犯法&quot;&gt;區重申35+目標僅立會過半非令政權倒台、「冇諗過亦都唔想犯法」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大狀 Trevor Beel 下午完成盤問，輪到代表鄒家成的大狀陳世傑盤問。就「35+」的目標，區同意2020年初時希望香港民主有進展、有好的制度和政府，而「35+計劃」並非要令政權倒台，主要目標只是想立會過半，有更好的談判力，讓泛民對政府政策有更有意義的影響。區同意，參與計劃時「我冇諗過亦都唔想犯法」，並強調「我哋真係盡咗全力去避免觸犯任何法例」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CxlFBKI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 代表鄒家成的大律師 陳世傑&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就本案的協議，區同意要先訂立協議的範圍和條款，並在協調會議討論。陳世傑問，當中是否只有少數項目達成共識？區指「睇你講係咩項目」，「我會話討論嘅嘢實際唔係真係好多。」區同意，戴耀廷在會議擔任領導角色，但最終共識是由各區決定，亦同意有很多不同人參與，「唔係咁容易」達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就選舉論壇，陳世傑問部分人是否表達過「挑釁性」的看法？法官李運騰亦指，根據片段有候選人被其他人猛烈攻擊。區表示論壇上「的確係有一啲好 provocative （挑釁性）嘅辯論」，辯方問是否不是針對其他人，而是針對制度，李運騰問什麼制度，陳世傑答「共產黨」，李糾正中共是當權者（authority）而非制度（system），多人發笑。陳再指，即使參與者的看法可能是挑釁、激進甚或瘋狂，也只是代表他們個人的看法？區稱「可以咁講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意戴加入運用否決權字眼為紀錄-官質疑草擬方式指已達成協議&quot;&gt;區同意戴加入運用否決權字眼為「紀錄」 官質疑草擬方式指「已達成協議」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑其後展示「35+計劃」文件，區同意文件顯示計劃主要目的，包括「五大訴求 缺一不可」，及在立法會取得35或以上的議席，該文件曾在部分協調會議展示。區同意，就各區最後達成的4項共識，其中3項包括舉辦初選、目標議席數目和替補機制都有在該份文件提及，至於舉辦初選論壇則沒有提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，運用權力否決財政預算案的條款沒有在該份文件出現，而是在協調會議中途才由戴耀廷提出和加入文件，最初與會者反應「不是太熱烈」，亦沒有達成共識。陳其後展示「35+立會過半計劃 民主派港島協調機制（初稿）」文件，第二點提及參與協調者「認同若民主派能取得立法會一半以上的議席，會積極運用立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳問區，為何沒有共識下，戴耀廷仍加入上述條款，區指戴在不同區的協調會議都有提及運用否決權的事情。陳問是否作為「紀錄」，以表達戴曾在會上提出或討論過此項目？區同意，並認為是「暫時的討論紀錄」。但李運騰質疑，根據其草擬方式，似乎並非討論的項目，而是已達成協議，區指「可以咁講」。他亦同意法官陳仲衡指條款中有「認同」的字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官稱戴無共識下加入否決權條款挺硬銷-區都係幾硬銷嘅&quot;&gt;官稱戴無共識下加入否決權條款「挺硬銷」 區：都係幾硬銷嘅&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，港島協調機制初稿是在3月26日首次會議後不久發出，而在該次會議前，只有3月24日九西會議曾討論該條款，但並沒有達成共識，惟事後戴在九西初稿加入相關條款，李運騰笑指其實那是戴的主意，區指「可以咁講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問，文件表面上看來是已達成協議，但實際上沒達成協議，李運騰亦指若文件是作會議紀錄之用，戴耀廷將上述條款列入其中是「不正確」，區表示：「所以我會話戴耀廷『希望』人認同第二點」。李追問：「他的做法挺硬銷，對不對？（“He was rather hard selling, isn’t it?”）」林卓廷聞言大笑，陳世傑再問，即戴的想法與現實是兩回事？區稱：「咁你可以睇到佢不斷寫文，開會又講，咁都係幾硬銷嘅」，有被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續問，條款提及「五大訴求」中「重啟政改以達雙普選」一項最初是否「要求特首下台」，並於2019年夏天改變為爭取雙普選，區同意，並主動重提張炳良著書指「完全係講呢個過程」，陳世傑打斷指毋須深究。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指戴耀廷單方面聲稱協調文件達成共識-區好難一刀切話-yes-or-no&quot;&gt;辯方指戴耀廷單方面聲稱協調文件達成「共識」 區：好難一刀切話 yes or no&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑其後就戴耀廷於6月8日，在組織者群組發出以「final.docx」命名的各區協調文件發問。陳指，區曾形容該文件包含各區「共識」的說法是不正確，區回應戴耀廷發出文件後在6月9日記者會視之為「共識」。陳續指，這只是戴單方面聲稱的「共識」，區指至少文件曾在各區協調會議上提及過。陳續問各人是否還未同意文件內容，區指「所以我一路話，唔同人對於呢個講法係會有唔同嘅睇法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳其後展示一份已簽署的「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新界西協議協調」文件，問戴耀廷發出各區協調文件的「final」檔，是否只是意圖邀請各人同意（invitation to agree）？區表示：「如果你話要一個候選人簽紙嘅就係認同，咁新界西呢個佢就認同咗嗰個共同綱領」，但亦認為不同參加者有不同看法，要視乎6月9日記者會的內容。陳世傑重申當天記者會亦是戴的單方面聲明，區指難以表述的是始終戴有參加各區的會議，但他同意戴類似提及各人已達成共識並反映在協調文件上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續問，戴耀廷的說法是否不代表其他人同意？區表示：「我真係唔敢講有幾多人係認同或者唔認同」，只能指開會過程的確有表達過不同意見，「我當然亦都唔敢講係咪個個人都睇過（協調文件）並且係有佢（戴耀廷）嘅睇法」。陳續指出，最終版本的文件並不包含各區共識，區指「大家可能有分歧，我哋好難一刀切話嗰樣嘢係 yes or no」，林卓廷說「嘩」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意新東就否決權條款傾唔成-辯方指戴耀廷發文件僅邀請人同意&quot;&gt;區同意新東就否決權條款「傾唔成」 辯方指戴耀廷發文件僅邀請人同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在法官李運騰詢問下，確認自己有出席所有新界東的協調會議，因此會知道會上各人有否達成共識。李續問，據區理解，最終新東就「會運用」或「會積極運用」否決權的字眼達成了什麼共識？區答：「無論係用『會積極運用』定『會運用』，都冇辦法得到與會人士嘅共識」，此時鄒家成攤開雙手聳肩。李追問，事實上是否沒有就該條款達成任何共識？區指「佢哋傾唔成」，鄒家成發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李再問，區6月8日在組織者群組看到戴發出的「final」文件時，認為是甚麼？認為文件旨在記錄已達成的共識，抑或是戴邀請各人同意？陳慶偉再指或者是戴耀廷捏造出來（made up）？區表示他只留意到該些是檔案，「我冇特別將佢諗成係大家已經做咗共識」，又指「如果你話係邀請人，咁嗰個檔案就會話係一個邀請函啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指新西參與者簽文件屬個人對文件的回應非共識-區可以咁講&quot;&gt;辯方指新西參與者簽文件屬個人對文件的「回應」非共識 區：可以咁講&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳其後再展示已簽署的新西協調文件，指有人在其上簽署，是否代表他已閱讀和同意該份文件，而該份已簽署文件是對相類似「final」檔案的「回應」（response），區同意。陳再指不是稱這是新西的共識，強調文件只是由個人簽署、只屬個人的事，區指「可以咁講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，所有新西候選人報名時均有夾附共同綱領，李運騰問除了尹兆堅外，是否所有新西參選人均同時有簽署「墨落無悔」？區指沒有統計但應該是。陳慶偉再問，候選人個別自願簽署及提交有關聲明，但是否代表是新界西的共識？區指「我冇開過新界西個會議，但係佢哋有交呢份嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。其中陳慶偉今配戴口罩，疑身體不適，說話聲線亦比平常小。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">區諾軒：「墨落無悔」屬「內鬥」寧願無、《國安法》及DQ下「35+」可能失敗 官稱戴耀廷無共識下加入否決財案條款「幾hard sell」 區諾軒認同</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第廿九日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-22-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-29.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第廿九日】" /><published>2023-03-22T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-03-22T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-29</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-22-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-29.html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uZqPmEE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（22日）踏入審訊第29天。區諾軒繼續接受代表何桂藍的大狀盤問，表示「墨落無悔」提及會用權否決預算案，是增加參選人被DQ的風險，但承認聲明上無提及「無差別」否決。區亦同意，雖然35+目標是要求政府回應「五大訴求 缺一不可」，但組織者對進入議會後的計劃無詳細討論、參與者亦無清楚說出過半後具體部署，亦沒有討論由誰帶領民主派。法官李運騰一度問，即使是戴耀廷也不能指揮？區指「可以咁講」，亦同意戴沒要求參選人簽文件，但「墨落無悔」就要作出表態，「係對組織者嘅一個異議」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，區同意戴曾提及以立會奪半作為「政治籌碼」，而區曾於訪問指拿到35+能「奪權」是「笑話」，他解釋香港「行政主導」、立會權力有限，即使民主派立會過半「仍受制於既有框架」；又指首次否決預算案後特首有權決定是否解散立法會，在第二次否決預算案後才必須下台。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱墨落無悔增加被dq風險-惟承認無提無差別否決財案&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱「墨落無悔」增加被DQ風險 惟承認無提「無差別」否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今繼續接受代表何桂藍的大狀 Trevor Beel 盤問。區早前同意辯方指，參選人被取消資格（DQ）是爭取立會過半無法移除的障礙，他今同意於2020年6月已意識到這個問題。法官陳仲衡指，若政府越早開始DQ，替補機制便越早開始啟動？區同意，指理論上候選人被DQ就要找到替補人選，並指若參選人在提名期被政府要求回答問題，「佢就應該要預計有機會被取消資格」，亦記得提名期中間，政府曾就部分人士提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，是否即參選人在選舉論壇的說話或會令他們被DQ？區指確切地說，若候選人「講咗一啲我暫且稱為超越紅線嘅說話啦，佢就會增加無法參選嘅風險」，而之所以用「風險」一詞，是因當刻他無法知道政府是否真會將相關言論視為DQ的理據。李運騰問「墨落無悔」聲明書是否其中一項？區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，區諾軒認為聲明書上哪點會令參選人有風險？區指如前所述，當時有輿論指若罔顧後果地否決財政預算案，會被視為不尊重《基本法》，但因無先例可循，故只能「主觀地估計」。辯方其後展示何桂藍在專頁發布的「墨落無悔」聲明書，區同意當中沒有提及「無差別」否決預算案，當時亦無法知道政府會否提問，但認為就提及「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」的第一點，會設想政府可能會問曾簽署聲明者，「請問佢係以乜嘢目的去運用否決權？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，「墨落無悔」於初選之前發布，當時並不知道誰會報名參選立法會，區同意。Beel 再問，那在6月份，區對DQ會否使「6 6 4 4 3」目標無法達成是否沒有很大關注？區回應：「我哋冇人有水晶球知道民主派一定能夠成功協調好，並且能夠妥為分配選票。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱初選其他文件不公開故政府無法就此提問對有參選人表態感好煩惱&quot;&gt;區稱初選其他文件不公開故政府無法就此提問、對有參選人表態感「好煩惱」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，35+目標是透過協調機制避免浪費選票，盡量爭取最多議席，而參選人公開作出聲明，會危及該目標。李運騰指，其實風險一直存在，只是「墨落無悔」將風險增加？區點頭，舉例「候選人本來冇一份資料畀政府提問佢嘅，但有咗份聲明，就有可能被政府拎嚟提問」。區同意李運騰指，初選有不同文件，包括「35+計劃」、及包含「會／會積極運用」否決權的共同綱領，該些文件向參與者發放但均沒有公開，故政府只能接觸到公開的「墨落無悔」並就此提問。區也同意，初選論壇上部分候選人的公開言論也會增加DQ風險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區早前提及，對2020年6月越來越多候選人作「政治表態」感到「好無奈」，認為「若果用咁多心機準備初選，到頭嚟候選人被取消資格，白費咗好多義工、好多人嘅心機」。Beel 問他當時是否對部分參與者感到不滿或不高興？區答：「我覺得好煩惱囉。」區並同意，他作為立法會議員曾否決預算案，「當時真誠地相信，（否決預算案）只係履行緊基本法賦予嘅權力啫。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉一度問，「墨落無悔」下的名字是誰加上去的，區答「真係唔知道」，有份發起聲明的鄒家成發笑。李運騰一度指，何桂藍的名字在岑敖暉後、彭卓棋前，表面上看來應是何簽完後再有人加名字在後面？區指根據FB帖文操作，只有管理者可以更改當中內容。李運騰指若他不知道，就不要猜測，區笑說「咁我唔好估計啦」，李又指因他們不熟悉FB運作，「你比我們年輕，我們想你或許知道」，區再笑說「我盡力協助大家」。李指沒關係，是控方而非區須證明，又指若果沒有證據，就是沒有證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意組織者無討論入議會後計劃-即使戴耀廷亦不能指揮泛民&quot;&gt;區同意組織者無討論入議會後計劃 即使戴耀廷亦不能指揮泛民&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒同意，新一屆立法會期開始5個月後，即2020年2月底至3月初是一般財政預算案首讀的時間。Beel 續問，但似乎組織者沒有討論過民主派在那5個月要做什麼？區答「冇討論過，太遠啦」。李運騰指，但迫使政府回應「五大訴求 缺一不可」的目標仍然存在？區同意，只是就如何達成沒有詳細討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 一度指，認為用要求政府「回應（respond）」而非「迫使（force）」的字眼較適合，李指「墨落無悔」是用「迫使」一詞，即使「回應」也是對威脅的回應（respond to a threat），或者「強烈說服（strongly persuade）」，法官陳慶偉則指是「威嚇（to cow somebody）」，李指可留待陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後指，根據區的證供，民主派當選後，沒有實質計劃或討論誰負責帶領其他人。區同意，並指據其觀察，「由2016年起，民主派嘅狀況就係咁」。區同意李運騰指是「分裂（fragmentation）」的狀態，並指當時立法會經常以「四大版塊」歸類不同民主派議員，同意李運騰指難以說有人帶領泛民主派。李再問，即使戴耀廷本人也不能指揮泛民（even Benny Tai himself is not in command of the pro-democratic camp, isn’t it?）？區指「可以咁講」。李再問，「墨落無悔」是否可視為挑戰35+組織者的決定？區回應，若戴耀廷無要求參選人簽署文件，但「墨落無悔」就要作出表態，「係對組織者嘅一個異議」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訪問提否定中共極權-區指政府做法好極端立會過半可籲政權勿走極權路線&quot;&gt;訪問提「否定中共極權」 區指政府做法「好極端」、立會過半可籲政權勿走極權路線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示區諾軒4月30日在 Facebook 轉載的《蘋果日報》訪問，〈民主派或五區齊初選定出線權 區諾軒：以「35+」否定中共極權路線〉。陳慶偉問，文章標題「以『35+』否定中共極權路線」有何意思，區指當時正值反修例運動，看到很多政府的做法「係好極端」，「若果民主派喺立法會攞到35+，可以話畀政權聽，唔應該再行極權或者極端嘅路線。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，文章第一段亦再提及「否定中共極權路線」，又指「明言標榜中間派人士若仍意欲尋找『好啲嘅特首』了事，不僅是保守，更是過份天真」，問區是否指中央選擇的特首是不好。區指當時有此說法，是因雙方都很「劍拔弩張」。陳慶偉指區某程度上是談及特首下台，區問可否閱覽訪問其他內容，笑言「我驚我……」。Beel 此時指，他展示文章是有問題想要問，問能否由他而非法官先問，陳慶偉指「No, thank you」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區其後表示，訪問背景應是中央重新詮釋《基本法》第22條（有關中央不得干預本港事務），當時政府一夜間更改新聞稿內容，「當時令我覺得，一國兩制下嘅高度自治空間，係有收窄嘅意思。」區續指，當時社會上一些政團如希望聯盟表示，「不如搵個中間啲嘅特首就可以解決到香港嘅問題」，但他認為只是揀選「中間啲」的特首「係冇辦法真係應對香港市民關心嘅問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱首次否決財案後-特首可決定是否解散立會-惟再否決便須下台&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱首次否決財案後 特首可決定是否解散立會 惟再否決便須下台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續引述區在訪問表示「在行政主導的體制下，議會極受局限，『所以話攞到35+係奪權，其實係笑話』」，問區「笑話」是甚麼意思。區指香港奉行行政主導制度，而立法會可運用的權力有限，根據《基本法》第47條有很多行政限制立法部門的措施，因此即使民主派於立法會有過半議席，「佢哋依然都係受制於既有嘅框架。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問到若立法會兩度被解散，特首是否必須下台？區表示「講到去最盡係會有呢個情況」，但他亦指若沒有記錯，第一次否決預算案後，解散立法會的權力是在「特首嘅手裏面」；而第一次解散後重選，若財政預算案第二次被否決，特首才須下台。Beel 一度問，若民主派被重選為多數派，是否代表獲香港人的支持（mandate）？區表示若市民「始終係投返咁多個民主派議員嘅話，咁呢個的確係市民嘅意願」。區並指，法律機制的假設，就是期望特首與立法會「最後能夠傾得成一個可以通過到嘅預算案」，而特首下台後，就要重選特首，期間或由政務司司長臨時代替特首職位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，因此根據《基本法》，是交由特首決定是否解散立法會，並假設特首是「合理（reasonable）」的？區重申特首「會去到一個位置，要決定解唔解散立法會」，因若繼續現時立法會組成，除非能與議員談得攏一個可通過的預算案，否則無法通過恆常撥款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意重選立法會結果由選民決定有人以否決預算案作為手段&quot;&gt;區同意重選立法會結果由選民決定、有人以否決預算案作為手段&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，不過爭議或是關乎預算案以外的東西，陳仲衡補充如「五大訴求，缺一不可」。區表示可以有這種情況，意指「通唔通過財政預算案係手段，其他嘅政治目標先係目的」。Beel 續問若立法會被解散，重選結果是否由選民投票決定？區指政治人物會互相「縱橫捭闔」、「博弈」，「但對市民嚟講，重選時佢哋始終要作出選擇嘅」，舉例指市民會考慮若長期沒有正常撥款，對於日常生活而言有很大壓力，同意最終是由選民決定是否重新投選民主派為大多數。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續問，35+組織者之所以有相關謀劃，是否因為民主派在區議會中大勝，因此亦想在立法會選舉勝出？區同意。惟 Beel 指，區議會與立法會的機制並不相同，前者是直接選舉，區同意，指立法會只有一半是直選，並奉行「比例代表制」；區議會則奉行「單議席單票制」，而「其中一個問題就勝者會過份被代表」。此時何桂藍鄒眉並面露愕然，其後掩嘴發笑，余慧明亦發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒同意各派系對過半後部署沒有具體答案&quot;&gt;區諾軒同意各派系對過半後部署沒有具體答案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文中另提及「而成功爭取議會過半後的具體部署，則是各派系必須說服選民投票前要回答的問題。區稱，按其觀察，不同派系代表都期望未來能於選舉組合出基本綱領，但具體做法仍未有共識」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問到不同派別最後有否就具體部署提出答案，區指直至舉行初選，各派系仍沒有清楚說出具體答案，雖然在協調會議中曾就共同綱領作出討論，但未有共識，至7月尾政府亦宣布選舉延期。Beel 一度指，組織者和參與者就像計劃一個行程，但不清楚抵達後要做什麼，區指「所以我呢篇文章都係講，唔同嘅派系，有唔同嘅想像，而佢哋係未傾清楚嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後續就各方的不同想像發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指戴耀廷目的是談判-區同意開天殺價落地還錢為談判策略&quot;&gt;辯方指戴耀廷目的是「談判」 區同意「開天殺價，落地還錢」為談判策略&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，辯方今亦展示戴耀廷3月3日文章〈反制警察政權就要立會奪半〉，提及「立會若能奪半，反對陣營就會多了一個重要政治籌碼，就是以威脅否決整份預算案來換取特區政府在某些方面讓步」。Beel 問，故戴耀廷目標是「談判」？區指文章有提「談判」，但要留意其基礎是以奪半作為政治籌碼，故若沒有否決預算案作為籌碼就沒有條件談判。Beel 指，即沒有過半就不能談判？區指「唔係話完全冇嘅」，指即使民主派過往一直在立法會佔少數，各黨派都可以與政府交涉。李運騰舉例即透過製造各種麻煩拖延議案？區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，在政治談判中，為了取得成果，雙方都需作出讓步。Beel 再問，為了讓自己有較強的位置，並不會向對方透露自己的底線？區認同有這種策略，指「有句廣東話叫『開天殺價，落地還錢』」。Beel 再問，區是否預期若政府作出讓步，民主派都會讓步？區指「如果大家肯一人行一步，就係啱啱我哋所講嘅談判」。李運騰指即一個手掌拍不響（it takes two to tango），若某方寸步不讓，就不能進行談判，區同意。李再問，區在論壇有否聽過參與者談及「先破後立」，區指「冇辦法忽然連繫到每一個言論」，但在李詢問下同意有聽過「破局」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再問，民主陣營的訴求是否普選，區同意。Beel 一度提及政府可能的回應，但被陳慶偉打斷，指 Beel 最終是要求證人揣測政府會做什麼，李運騰補充更是要揣測反對派會否同意妥協，但那涉及太多假設。李並指，認為 Beel 已成功提出有人或許想談判。Beel 表示會問最後一條問題，指普選是否五大訴求中最重要（paramount），惟李運騰再打斷，指證人只能代表自己，而非其他人回答，尤其他已表明民主派陣營光譜廣闊，Beel 遂沒有繼續再問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZNoz1nf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（22日）踏入審訊第29天。區諾軒繼續接受代表何桂藍的大狀盤問，認為主張否決預算案向北京施壓的攬炒一派，是「表達緊一種絕望」，因覺得長時間無法實現理想的香港，要用盡抗爭手段爭取「破局」，「置諸死地而後生。」區指「攬炒」是「雙輸局面」，並形容戴耀廷「攬炒十步」說法是「講到出晒界」。區解釋不認為需「置諸死地」時，一度指香港是「金絲雀」，法官指從沒有聽過，區續指記得有中共元老提及：「香港係一個紫砂茶壺，係冇必要打爛佢嘅。」翻查資料，前全國政協主席李瑞環曾以紫砂茶壺評論香港回歸，指有老婦將祖傳紫砂茶壺賣掉前，以為骯髒而將茶垢抹掉，結果令茶壺一文不值。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，庭上就翻譯問題爭議，其中提及攬炒一派主張「寧願你（北京）做得最赤祼」，法庭傳譯主任將「最赤祼」譯為「the most horrible things」，何桂藍起身反對，指其代表大狀不諳中文，錯誤翻譯嚴重阻礙其理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱攬炒派寧願北京做得最赤裸-解釋無法實現訴求亦望政權用好核突方法應對&quot;&gt;區稱攬炒派寧願北京做得最赤裸 解釋無法實現訴求亦望政權用「好核突方法」應對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 繼續就《蘋果日報》2020年4月30日對區諾軒的訪問〈民主派或五區齊初選定出線權 區諾軒：以「35+」否定中共極權路線〉發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文中提及公眾或候選人都對「35+」有兩種不同想像：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「其一是透過議會過半提高民主派的議價能力及政治力量，爭取五大訴求，『至於點樣爭取係冇人傾落去嘅，亦都好難去傾，因為牽涉到到時個政治局勢係點』；另一種是不惜攬炒，否決《財政預算案》等向北京施壓，『寧願你（北京）做得最赤祼，咁你唔好再令香港存有任何幻想』。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區一度指對文章英譯本有異議，因攬炒一派主張被譯成「we」，「會令人誤會包括我在內，所有人都有呢種諗法。」李運騰其後問，攬炒一派「寧願你（北京）做得最赤祼，咁你唔好再令香港存有任何幻想」，「幻想」指的是什麼？區指戴耀廷自4月起一系列有關攬炒的文章可以代表這派人的想法，「佢哋會覺得，就算我冇辦法爭取到想要嘅嘢，我都要你做得最赤裸」，意思是「你就算唔畀我去實現我嘅訴求都好啦，你都要用一啲好核突嘅方法去應對」。法庭傳譯主任將「最赤祼」譯為「the most horrible things」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;最赤裸譯成most-horrible-何桂藍質疑法庭翻譯出錯影響律師理解&quot;&gt;「最赤裸」譯成「most horrible」 何桂藍質疑法庭翻譯出錯影響律師理解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時何桂藍舉手，指認為傳譯主任翻譯上嚴重出錯，將「最赤裸」翻譯成「the most horrible」是完全錯誤，但她的律師並不懂說廣東話。李運騰指可讓區諾軒先完成該部分證供，惟何再指這嚴重影響她律師的理解（“It is seriously impeding my counsel’s understanding.”）。李着她保持安靜和與律師溝通，又指可確保本案法官能理解中英文（bilingual）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區表示「我試吓諗吓一個啱嘅翻譯」，並提議「將現象向公眾揭露（expose the phenomenon to the public）」，法官陳慶偉指不是現象，直譯應是「赤裸（naked）」，主控周天行同意。傳譯主任則解釋用「the most horrible things」是根據文章的法庭核證英文譯本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指攬炒一派表達緊一種絕望置諸死地而後生&quot;&gt;區諾軒指攬炒一派「表達緊一種絕望」、「置諸死地而後生」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，區提及戴耀廷攬炒文章代表較激進者想法，是否包括〈真攬炒十步〉。區指該文章於4月29日刊出，他做訪問時尚未看到。李再追問「幻想」指什麼，是否代表中央沒有真誠（sincere）看待「一國兩制」？傳譯主任一度將「sincere」譯作「重視」，其後更正為「誠意地睇呢樣嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，主張攬炒一派「冇具體指涉政治制度」，而據其解讀，他們「其實係表達緊一種絕望」，「佢哋覺得咁長嘅時間都冇辦法實現到佢哋心目中理想嘅香港，所以要用盡佢哋抗爭嘅手段，去爭取一個破局。當然亦有一種意思就係，置諸死地而後生嘅意思。」李運騰問是想將什麼置諸死地？區答「我唔知我係咪一個啱嘅位置講，因為我唔係好詳細研究佢哋嘅論述」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區再欲解釋時，李運騰指 Beel 要就翻譯問題索取指示。就「赤裸」的翻譯問題，Beel 一度稱有如「國王的新衣」。陳慶偉則指，辯方最終要說明的只是有兩個派別的想法，認為「赤裸」的翻譯如何並不重要（neither here nor there）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/n8UeQ4R.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指攬炒非戴耀廷所創戴演繹其版本-惟已脫離參與者看法&quot;&gt;區指「攬炒」非戴耀廷所創、戴演繹其版本 惟已脫離參與者看法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;午休後，法官陳仲衡主動提到，英文以「浴火重生（“Phoenix is reborn from ashes.”）」來形容「置諸死地而後生」會否較恰當，區同意是恰當翻譯，林卓廷亦附和：「火鳳凰啊！」區並同意 Beel 指，新界東4月14日的首次協調會議上沒有人提倡「攬炒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，「攬炒」一詞於2019年社會運動已出現，並已有一段時間，區指最早出現「攬炒論」是在連登等網上論壇，並同意與他在訪問提到的「攬炒」語境不同。區亦同意 Beel 指「攬炒」一詞並非由戴耀廷所創，戴是「演繹咗佢一個版本」，而區在訪問提及的是近似戴的版本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，否決預算案本身是否不會導致「攬炒」，區認為可以分開看，指否決預算案可以是單獨行為，而戴的「攬炒」中，否決預算案只是其中一個元素。被問戴提及的「攬炒」與35+是否並無連繫，區重申認為戴文章所述已脫離參與者的看法，只是戴個人想法而非任何人共識，但可被視為戴當時演繹「35+」看法的「演進」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指立法會最多令政府沒有適切撥款但不會令政府完全唔能夠運作&quot;&gt;區指立法會最多令政府沒有適切撥款、但不會令政府「完全唔能夠運作」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再問及文中兩種想像，區表示就透過立會過半提高議價能力一派，「財政預算案否決權係一種籌碼或者係一種能力嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指戴耀廷在很多文章談及類似看法，並引戴4月文章〈香港攬炒大對決〉，提到民主派正密鑼緊鼓部署立法會選舉，望奪取一半議席，「民主派明言若能成功，在明年就會否決財政預算案，到時立法會有可能被解散，特區政府也可能停擺。民主派的策略是以『攬炒』去迫使中共及特區政府就『反送中』所提出的五大訴求作讓步」，問區所指「否決權是籌碼」的想法是否相似。區指他是第一次看這篇文章，並認為該觀點其實應是屬於主張攬炒一派的觀點，在2020年4月或更早已經出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，若預算案被否決，只是「可能」會導致立法會解散和政府停擺，但立法會不會直接令政府停擺？區解釋，立法會最多令政府財政沒有得到適切撥款（insufficient fund），但不會令政府「完全唔能夠運作」，而政府仍可向立法會申請臨時撥款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指攬炒導致雙輸局面-望透過死局達致浴火重生&quot;&gt;區指「攬炒」導致「雙輸局面」 望透過「死局」達致「浴火重生」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，區如何理解上文「攬炒」意思，區一度猶豫「其實我係咪真係適切去……」，並指如一定要回答，就會說是「由否決財政預算案到特區政府停擺呢個步驟」。Beel 追問，「攬炒」包含雙方遭受破壞的意思，那是什麼被破壞？傳譯主任譯為「即係『炒』啲咩呢？」，有旁聽人士發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續指，知道政府遭受的破壞，但另一邊是破壞什麼？區表示：「既然政府運作都得唔到撥款，咁市民都係會受害囉。」陳再問該破壞會否指民主制度的崩潰？區進一步解釋，2020年社會上有很大矛盾，民主路亦很難有寸進，就他理解「攬炒」的意思，「就係政府冇辦法得益，市民都冇辦法得益，民主派作為代表市民嘅代表，佢哋都冇辦法爭取到佢哋為市民爭取嘅嘢」。他續指：「呢種狀態係一種壓力，點解要有呢一種壓力，係因為要有一個更大嘅目標去爭取，希望任何一方都能夠透過各種方法離開呢一種壓力狀態，最終就有浴火重生嘅嗰個結果。」這時何桂藍竊笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李問，區是指「攬炒」如「死局」（deadlock），最後無人得益，只有雙方損失？區形容這是「雙輸局面，lose-lose situation」。李追問，是否為了避免雙輸，才希望透過「死局」來催生新的局面？區答「我會咁樣睇件事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方以冷戰作為攬炒例子-官不同意指應是互相威懾&quot;&gt;辯方以冷戰作為攬炒例子 官不同意指應是「互相威懾」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 一度問，故「攬炒」是否達致一個「平衡」？陳慶偉指問題太抽象，Beel 遂改為舉出1960年代的冷戰作為例子，指當時兩邊即使有核武器但均不敢使用，因為雙方均會死亡，而這便達致「平衡」。惟法官陳慶偉表示，這並非「攬炒」，而是「互相威懾」（mutual deterrence），以避免某些事情發生；法官陳仲衡亦指，若按下按鈕（發射核彈）的話，才會造成「攬炒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱香港爭取民主不應出晒界-一度指香港是金絲雀辯方指是生金蛋的鵝&quot;&gt;區稱香港爭取民主不應「出晒界」 一度指香港是「金絲雀」、辯方指是「生金蛋的鵝」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 繼而就戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步〉一文發問，問為何區指戴想法瘋狂。區指他一直說初選是協調不同民主派派系，而就算要討論運用財政預算案的否決權，亦是《基本法》列明的權力，「但你唔需要用得着將件事推到去要攬住中共跳出懸崖。喺香港爭取民主，係唔應該將呢啲講法講到…我形容為出晒界。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡追問：「鳳凰不需要浴火（毋需置諸死地）？（“No need to burn the phoenix?”）」，區同意，並指「既然以前我哋都話香港係一隻金絲雀…」，此時被告席傳來驚訝聲音，有人稱：「吓？」，林卓廷、鄒家成及余慧明等發笑。李運騰指：「我沒有聽過這個說法，只是聽過生金蛋」，林卓廷說「係囉」，Beel 稱：「是生金蛋的鵝（“The goose that lays the golden egg.”）」，多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區於是改稱：「我用個好啲嘅比喻啦，我記得有一位中共元老話，香港係一個紫砂茶壺，係冇必要打爛佢嘅。」這時何桂藍等再發笑。翻查資料，前全國政協主席李瑞環曾於1995年以紫砂茶壺評論香港回歸，指有老婦將祖傳紫砂茶壺賣掉前，以為骯髒而將茶垢抹掉，結果令茶壺一文不值。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問戴的文章是否對將要發生的事有錯誤的前設（flawed premise），是不現實的，區同意當中基於很多假設。李再問既然區認為戴瘋狂，有否告知他，區表示有告訴他，但已忘記對方的回應，不過戴並無提及自己有錯，區亦不排除辯方指，其文章是想引起社會討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指若無法律風險及延期選舉-立會選舉結果公佈後會視為功成身退&quot;&gt;區指若無法律風險及延期選舉 立會選舉結果公佈後會視為「功成身退」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在盤問下表示，沒有因協調初選收取報酬。Beel 續問初選結束後，他的工作是否已完成？區先指「我尤其係退出咗初選啦，咁之後我都會視一切已經完結啦」，李運騰澄清辯方是問他若沒有退出，會在何時視自己的工作為完結，又問他還有沒有剩餘工作要處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指若沒有法律風險及延期選舉，其工作包括在初選投票日後，就香港島、九龍西和新界東3區商討出選名單數目，因該3區協調未完成；找香港民意研究所做民意調查；立會競選後期亦要監察棄選機制妥為運行，中間當然也有無數行政或財政工作。區並指，「當立法會選舉結果公佈，我會視為功成身退。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區表示與吳璟雋為大學校友-相信他能給予好的意見&quot;&gt;區表示與吳璟雋為大學校友 相信他能給予好的意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在盤問下同意，退出初選是因為擔心初選的合法性。區提及曾約見時任政制及內地事務局政治助理吳璟儁徵詢補救措施，Beel 問他何時與吳見面，區表示要翻查行事曆，但發現已無法找到6月23日之後的內容，他不肯定是已刪除還是沒有輸入資料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，記得於7月13或14日，即退出初選前的一兩天，在灣仔星街一間餐廳與吳見面。區指他當日早上主動聯絡吳，對方建議短暫見面，同意二人為大學校友，在他畢業不久後的校友活動上認識，其後吳任政治助理時，雙方在公務上有來往。被問到為何要找吳，區指他為政制及內地事務局聯絡人，兩人亦相識，相信吳「會畀到我一個好嘅意見」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱中聯辦譴責後亮起紅燈-政治判斷解散初選&quot;&gt;區稱中聯辦譴責後「亮起紅燈」 政治判斷解散初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意當時已收到戴耀廷有關初選合法的保證，但7月13日早上，中聯辦及港澳辦發聲明批評初選涉違法，區亦擔心會違法。被問為何稱因「政治判斷」決定退出，區解釋自己對法律無專業認識，但官方機構開始指責初選涉嫌違法，「我多少要向所有參加者、所有義工負責」，故政治判斷是「一定要解散初選」。李運騰續問：「是否見到亮起紅燈？（red light is on）」，區同意，又指初選前已知政制及內地事務局局長曾國衛曾批評，「咁呢個都係警號嚟」，但他當時沒有細心冷靜思考。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡其後問到，區諾軒擔心初選違法，是指初選投票，抑或否決預算案、解散立法會及特首下台等步驟，區答「初選整件事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指卸任民陣召集人部署離開政壇-惟因眾志找plan-b而參與補選&quot;&gt;區指卸任民陣召集人部署離開政壇 惟因眾志找「Plan B」而參與補選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後問到，為何區要於2017年9月離開民主黨，區指當時民間人權陣線召集人的職務已完結，「我當時候已經部署離開政壇，我亦都搵咗人接區議會嘅班，我當時認為冇必要一定要留喺民主黨。」辯方指他數個月後參與2018年立法會補選，區同意，解釋因當時香港眾志要找「Plan B」參選（羅冠聰被DQ），「我當時認為如果用得着我嘅時候，就使用我啦。」Beel 問他為何不加入香港眾志，區表示其政治理念與香港眾志「不全然相同」，而且無黨派身份有助他與不同黨派合作，參與當時選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後就立法會程序發問，區同意可就議案投「支持」、「反對」或「棄權」，Beel 一度問因此沒有人有「否決權」，惟法官打斷指證據清晰，沒有需要發問。區其後同意自己曾反對預算案，惟 Beel 問他有沒有看到議員慣性投反對票、《議事規則》是否沒有規定他如何投票、他是否有自由意志投票時，陳慶偉均禁止發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱曾提修正案惟功能組別成日投贏我哋建制主席不接納民主派議案&quot;&gt;區稱曾提修正案惟「功能組別成日投贏我哋」、建制主席不接納民主派議案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 亦問及財政預算案流程，區同意撥款條例草案先交草案委員會，其後財委會召開特別會議討論，議員可提出修正案。他指他與泛民主派經常提出修正案，但能成功通過「真係唔係好多」，「因為我哋係少數，同埋（在分組點票下）功能組別成日投贏我哋」，鄒家成和陳志全等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區又舉例當時由建制派陳健波做財委會主席，陳很多時因重複或各種理由，不接納民主派議員的議案。李運騰一度問，所以議案未去到投票，而是根本未能呈上議會？區答：「所以我哋要及時遞交呢啲議案」，並指「總會有（民主派修正案獲通過），有時建制派都會支持」，視乎議案內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰最後指，本案已接近原定日數的三分一，仍然在盤問首名控方證人，關注審訊進度。Beel 指希望他不是唯一一個導致審訊延長的人，並指盤問快要結束，只會就協調會議、選舉論壇和抗爭派等發問，預計明早能完成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

The engine is the heart of the combat air power and integrated weapon systems. Jet engines require sophisticated design and manufacturing expertise — which has been built up in aircraft engine–producing nations over decades — and not only produce thrust, but also power avionics and aircraft systems.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;This paper examines major non-U.S. players in the engine market, with a particular focus on both allies and potential adversaries. It also analyzes how China has sought to translate its growing technological prowess into a military engine industrial base. Beginning with British sales of engine technology to China in the 1970s and supported by Russian assistance after the fall of the Soviet Union, Beijing has been making a long-term concerted effort to develop an organic, fully indigenous, manufacturing capacity — albeit with mixed success. Evidence suggests China will continue to focus on developing this capacity, raising questions about both its military capabilities and how the turbofan market may evolve with the entrant of a new competitor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military jet engines power some of the most important combat capabilities for air forces around the world. The development, testing, and manufacturing of jet engines is a significant technical feat that industries in only a handful of nations can achieve. But there is a potential, serious new competitor: in recent decades, China has spent billions of dollars to grow its organic capability. The global engine ecosystem — and its links to global technology proliferation — may have played a vital role in enabling China’s campaign of learning. This brief seeks to determine how the global military turbofan engine market operates and whether there are possible avenues for technology proliferation that China has exploited as it seeks to build an organic jet engine industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-european-military-engine-ecosystem&quot;&gt;The European Military Engine Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest jet engines were designed in Western Europe during the early stages of World War II, with both Germany and the United Kingdom making substantial investments in the technology. After the war, British jet engine technology was transferred to the United States as part of their partnership. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union was able to capture German technology, giving it its foundation in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western Europe’s leading aerospace firms maintain a strong presence in the international market, specializing in selling 4.5-generation aircraft and their respective engines. France and the United Kingdom lead in fighter exports to countries outside of Europe, as shown in Figure 1. Of the major European aerospace exporters, the United Kingdom maintained the largest market share from 1990 to 2018, with the number of French exports gradually overtaking their British competitors after 2018. However, the growing popularity of the United States’ F-35 among European nations may disrupt European aerospace firms’ opportunity to sell their fighters and accompanying engines to regional customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rolls-Royce, the United Kingdom’s only jet engine manufacturer, plays a significant role in the global military and commercial turbofan markets. In its military business, Rolls-Royce engines have powered successive generations of European fighter aircraft. The Eurofighter Typhoon and Panavia Tornado feature engines developed by cross-European consortiums, but ones in which Rolls-Royce took on the most complex design and manufacturing tasks. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) also purchases Rolls-Royce propulsion systems for the B-52, C130, and F-35B programs. Its military output is, however, a comparatively small share of the company, with its commercial engines business accounting for roughly 2.5 times the revenue as that of military engines in 2021. This gives the company flexibility and the ability to sustain itself even when commercial or military business fluctuates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safran, France’s leading jet engine manufacturer, powers the majority of the French Air and Space Force’s (AAE) aircraft. Safran’s defense enterprise is financially supported by a robust commercial business that allows the firm to develop innovative technologies in tandem with foreign firms to enable broader market access. It does not enjoy formal links to the United States, since France pursues a “buy European” approach to aerospace defense procurements. However, this means that within the European Union, Safran is the most successful and sophisticated manufacturer of turbofan engines. Safran’s most advanced turbofan engines, the M88, began production nearly 30 years ago and have gradually been upgraded to power the Rafale series of aircraft; newer iterations of the M88 have 20 percent more thrust than the original model. Safran is currently leading a consortium of European firms to produce a new engine to power a sixth-generation aircraft that will enter service with the French, German, and Spanish air forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European government and defense contractors are beginning to develop sixth-generation aircraft platforms, comparable to the DoD’s Next Generation Air Dominance platform. The United Kingdom, Japan, and Italy are embarking on a sixth-generation fighter-development effort, the Global Combat Air Program, that will embrace expertise from across the three nations (and their largest defense contractors) in an effort to deliver home-grown combat air power. France, Germany, and Spain have also agreed to cooperate on a fighter aircraft, in what will undoubtedly be a complex industrial coordination effort. These two programs represent the bulk of future opportunities for European engine makers in the military turbofan space. Depending on the size of these aircraft fleets, future business prospects for military turbofans across Europe could prove to be limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;propulsion-on-a-budget-the-soviet-union-russia-and-the-struggle-to-evolve&quot;&gt;Propulsion on a Budget: The Soviet Union, Russia, and the Struggle to Evolve&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet Union built upon the technology it had extracted from Germany at the end of World War II to become a player in the engine market. During the Cold War, it exported a significant number of weapons to developing states at an affordable cost relative to Western equipment, a price dynamic that partially explains the prominence of Soviet and Russian turbofan engines abroad. The majority of Russian or Soviet fighter aircraft in use today are powered by Soviet-era turbofan engines that are comparable to the United States’ Cold War–era powerplants, especially when it comes to reliability and service life. As a result, Russian engines are not competitive relative to their current Western counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet Union was also able to be somewhat selective in whom it sold arms to and refused to sell weapons to China for decades, largely on political grounds. Post-Soviet Russia, however, has not had such a luxury, as financial pressures began to threaten its aircraft engine industry. As a result, Russia began making significant sales to China in the 1990s, a decision that could imperil the future of Russia’s export market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/e92uiFA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Soviet and Post-Soviet Military Aircraft and Jet Engine Exports, 1990–2021.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers&quot;&gt;“SIPRI Arms Transfers Database,” Stockholm International Peace Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collapse of the Soviet Union presented the Russian aircraft engine industrial base with a myriad of organizational and financial challenges. The newly independent Russian government privatized the Soviet-era engine-design bureaus while dramatically reducing procurement. This prompted the design bureaus to engage in costly legal battles with Boris Yeltsin’s administration to protest privatization or to try to reorient their new businesses to producing aero-derivative gas turbines. In the latter case, these aero-engine design bureaus typically partnered with Western firms to develop new technologies better suited to commercial uses. This dynamic likely presented Russia with several opportunities to reverse engineer Western technological and procedural innovations. Eventually, these Soviet-era aero-engine design bureaus merged to form the state-owned United Engine Corporation (UEC) in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ongoing challenge for Russian engine production is its lack of capacity in machine tools, which are vital to the precision manufacturing required for modern turbofan production. This capability gap derives from the advent of advanced computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools, meaning Soviet machine tools lost their competitiveness in the global market. As a result, Russia imported about 80–90 percent of its machine tools from 2009 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia had been rebuilding its machine-tool sector by the time it invaded Crimea in 2014, the nation was left unprepared to offset its reliance on Western imports when associated sanctions took hold. Specifically, Russia produced 3,871 pieces of machinery in 2014, up from 2,945 in 2013 — though its output tumbled by 14 percent in 2015 to 3,367 pieces of machinery as sanctions limited imports of components. Russia has managed to evade these sanctions in some cases, including by using shell companies. In 2018, the Ufa Engine Industrial Association, one of the largest subsidiaries of UEC, imported a German universal-grinding machine despite U.S. sanctions on the company. This tool is capable of resharpening existing tools to meet current and future production needs. Additionally, UEC Saturn imported machine presses from Germany in 2019 to manufacture engine blades for gas turbines, which could be repurposed for military applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As sanctions continue to tighten, Russia will likely inch toward near-complete isolation from the international machine-tool market for both new machines and replacement parts. Its aircraft engine production capabilities will continue to atrophy unless an alternative to Western machinery is found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-slow-climb-toward-indigenous-engines&quot;&gt;China’s Slow Climb toward Indigenous Engines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and its People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) have made significant investments in advancing capabilities to develop advanced air-superiority platforms, including a focus on fourth- and fifth-generation aircraft, with the PLAAF striving to operate modern aircraft, including the J-10, J-20, and J-31, in the near future. China is now able to develop and produce advanced airframes, although it still lacks the capacity to build fully indigenous aircraft engines. While China has certainly made improvements, it still lacks the manufacturing expertise and tacit knowledge required to build modern turbofan engines. In the past, China primarily turned to the United Kingdom and former Soviet Union for jet engines, as shown in Figure 3. However, as China’s needs have grown, Beijing has embarked on an ambitious indigenization effort that uses tools from across government and industry to offset foreign dependencies for key capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ur3GB3h.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Chinese Imports of Military Aircraft and Jet Engines, 1990–2021.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers&quot;&gt;“SIPRI Arms Transfers Database,” Stockholm International Peace Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s indigenous production of jets is relatively new, as the nation historically relied on imports from Russia to expand its fleet. SIPRI data show these countries are still major trading partners, with most Chinese imports of aircraft and jet engines from 1990 through 2021 originating in Russia. These imports have shifted from delivery of complete jets to that of engines. In 2001, China procured four Russian AL-31F engines, and this figure grew to 45 per year by 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese attempts to indigenize engine production began in the 1970s. The country’s initial efforts consisted of licensed production arrangements with established Russian and Western firms that exported parts, assembly lines, and necessary knowledge to China, which carried out the final assembly without needing to develop its own engineering expertise. This process allowed Chinese industry to gain access to the tooling and technical knowhow that it later deployed to produce indigenous engines, though ones that lagged their Western counterparts significantly in terms of reliability and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it took until 2013 for the production line to produce homegrown engines, drawing on the tooling and manufacturing support of Rolls-Royce. In 1976, Rolls-Royce sold the rights and machinery to produce its Spey MK.202 turbofan engines, intended for use in Chinese tactical ground-attack aircraft, to the Chinese aerospace industry. It was expected that it would take about 10 years — not 30 — for China to start production of the WS9 engine, its version of the Spey. While China gaining this capability is certainly a concern, it also demonstrates how difficult it has been for China to successfully complete an allowed transfer of technology, let alone reverse engineer Western turbofan engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s changing political environment and the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 altered the nation’s relationships with the West, and Western arms-trade embargoes meant that the United States and other nations were no longer reliable trading partners. However, Rolls-Royce temporarily continued exports of its Spey engine to China due to the United Kingdom’s deliberately broad interpretation of the embargo, which allowed exports of components of tactical fighter aircraft. In the face of criticism in the House of Commons, the UK government defended this policy by arguing that it was conducting a rigorous risk analysis that included “the risk of reverse engineering or unintended technology transfer” as a possible condition for denial of license. China thus shifted its sights to a financially strained Russia still recovering from the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In 1992, Beijing and Moscow signed the Military-Technical Cooperation Agreement, which outlined joint cooperative efforts and signaled both states’ sustained national prioritization of bolstering each other’s air forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this period, cooperative activities included technical-exchange seminars, coworking events, the sharing of experts, and — most notably — the exchange of production capabilities, theoretically giving China the ability to meet its own demand. Russia agreed to aid China’s domestic production of SU-27 aircraft by giving it both a license to produce the airframe and entire assembly lines sourced from surplus Russian machine tooling. As part of this cooperation, Russians worked closely with Chinese engineers in a consultative capacity within China’s factories. China developed larger aspirations for its engine capabilities and initiated work on indigenous production of aircraft engines. Beijing began to reverse engineer the technologies of the SU-27 aircraft that Russia had provided and that would form the basis for the WS-10 engine, which China began to market as an indigenously made and produced engine despite being deeply reliant on foreign technologies for knowledge and inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Moscow discovered this unauthorized replication, the Sino-Soviet relationship began to deteriorate. In 2019, Yevegny Livadny, the chief of intellectual property (IP) projects at the Rostec State Corporation, publicly complained about China’s imitation of Russian engines and aircraft. Livadny’s comments exemplified broader Russian frustration that China was illegally reverse engineering many Russian technologies so it would not have to pay Russia for additional products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-modernization-efforts&quot;&gt;China’s Modernization Efforts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 2017 report, Chinese analysts concluded that Beijing’s strategy to imitate rather than gradually develop indigenous technical knowledge caused it to lag international competitors. The analysts asserted that “China has no mature products for aviation engines; compared with the world’s aero-engine giants, we cannot be a first-tier supplier,” and China is “at the end of our industrial supply chain: our technical level and profitability is limited.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are additional signs of a lack of Chinese domestic expertise. China began development on its most advanced engine, the WS-15, in the late 1990s, but it is only recently beginning to use it an experimental capacity. The engine made its first flight on a J-20 aircraft sometime in 2022, according to Liu Daxiang, a Chinese expert who spoke at the 2022 China Aviation Industry Conference. In addition to trying to develop an engine that meets the thrust-to-weight requirements of fifth-generation aircraft, Chinese aerospace engineers are struggling to achieve meaningful reliability. Currently, Chinese jet engines can at best achieve one-fourth the life span of Western engines. This calls their reliability into serious question and suggests additional strains on China’s industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China seeks to expand its engine-manufacturing capacity, developing and acquiring key competencies is a core goal for Chinese government and industry so they can overcome existing hurdles throughout the manufacturing process. To this end, Beijing has worked to harness expertise and equipment from outside China, including by forming partnerships with Western universities to gain critical aerospace experience and expertise. Building talented human capital in the aerospace sector is vital to indigenous Chinese jet engine manufacturing capabilities, and external experience and expertise will help Chinese engineers improve both manufacturing and engine-development techniques. The United States, along with select allies and partners, has recognized this route to gaining tacit aerospace knowledge and has been working to limit access to certain programs for students who may pose a proliferation risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;manufacturing-challenges&quot;&gt;Manufacturing Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One barrier to Chinese domestic engine manufacturing is the availability of machine tooling that is suitable for aerospace applications. While the engines can be made of components completely produced in China, they are manufactured on Western machines. The most complex machine tools, five-axis and seven-axis systems, require immense engineering talent to manufacture and operate, and Chinese aerospace firms still have to import these systems from abroad — including from German, Japanese, Italian, and likely Korean firms. This dependence on the West for the most complex machinery limits comprehensive indigenization and, as China recognizes, is a source of risk for the country’s aerospace sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, machine tooling is a strategic capability with direct ties to the strength of a country’s defense-industrial base. Access to advanced 5-axis and 7-axis machine tooling dictates the ability to manufacture products such as large aircraft structures, compressor blades on turbines, and inertial navigation systems. Russia’s failures to manage these technologies during the 1990s and early 2000s led to a plummeting demand in the face of the global market and technological advances from the West. This may serve as a cautionary tale to Chinese defense planners as they work to build secure, indigenous capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another barrier to large-scale Chinese jet engine manufacturing is lack of knowledge of how to optimize the manufacturing process, despite attempts to exfiltrate this information. In 2018, Chinese-American citizen Xiaoqing Zheng was convicted by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for his involvement in stealing trade secrets regarding turbine sealing, a dual-use technology that is commonly employed in the development of aero engines. In another case, Chinese intelligence officer Xu Yanjun targeted experts employed by Western aerospace companies to both provide sensitive manufacturing data and speak to Chinese engineers in an effort to improve the country’s manufacturing processes. However, China has not yet been able to use the stolen information successfully to indigenize its aircraft engine industry. According to David Markov of the Institute for Defense Analyses, “Many of China’s scientists, engineers, designers, and production managers . . . lack the know-how that comes from apprenticeship programs and decades of specialized experience,” as is increasingly evident by Chinese firms’ inability to successfully integrate stolen IP, especially from the aerospace industry, into their indigenous manufacturing processes, a problem that could take decades to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engine market remains strong worldwide, with several competitors offering value to commercial and military users. The global nature of the market has also created opportunities for the United States’ competitors, namely China, to onshore components of jet engine technology. Despite numerous instances of jet engine technology proliferation to that nation, there is little evidence to suggest that China has, or imminently will, reach parity with Western engine technology. However, there is robust evidence that it is making a concerted effort to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ primary strategic competitors, China and Russia, face different challenges in producing turbofan jet engines. Soviet aircraft engines were not designed to turn a profit and historically could count on government subsidies to finance production. After the breakup of the Soviet Union and the disappearance of these subsidies, Russian aircraft engine firms lost production capability — but not their knowledge base. China faces the opposite problem; its production capabilities are largely restricted due to a lack of technical knowledge rather than a lack of resources. China has actively pursued opportunities to gain this knowledge by copying the innovations of other firms, engaging in partnerships that involve technology transfer, and working with universities around the world to gain new insights. China’s public recognition of its existing challenges signals that this is a priority across its managed economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To close its capability gap, China has been able to import advanced machine tooling from nations such as Germany, Italy, and Japan, which have supplied China with key pieces of manufacturing equipment it cannot produce domestically. It has also resorted to espionage campaigns to capture necessary manufacturing expertise. However, despite these efforts — and partly due to the complexity of the manufacturing process — China has been unable to reach parity with Western firms. Historically, Chinese engines have been lagging their Western counterparts by roughly 30 years. In recent years, China’s efforts to develop maritime turbines, which rely on less complex but similar technology, seem to have taken closer to 15 years. While it may appear that the West has a comfortable lead over China in the turbofan market, strategic surprise is possible as the Chinese workforce becomes better educated and the government continues to make significant investments in the aerospace sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is likely to maintain an enduring advantage in the engine market. However, if China grows its jet engine capabilities, it could not only increase its military capability but also potentially become a new market competitor with a demonstrated willingness to sell products at reduced costs to drive out competition. To reduce the chance of strategic surprise, the United States and its allies and partners may find it advantageous to take steps to limit China’s rise in this critically important industry. In the absence of such measures, an increasingly fiscally desperate and politically isolated Russia — more likely to take long-term risks — may upend the status quo by transferring sensitive technology to China. Understanding the historical impact that Western sanctions have had on the Russian aerospace industry could provide a valuable framework for confronting China; however, there are many confounding variables in the Russian aerospace industry, and additional research is needed to fully assess that case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies and partners have two broad options for managing the rise of China’s aerospace sector. First, they can carefully control what information China has access to and continue to be vigilant in preventing the unintentional transfer of sensitive engineering information, including in a university setting. Given the size of some Western firms’ business in China, managing the flow of information may prove challenging, but these firms do have an incentive to keep China from gaining foreign manufacturing expertise that could limit its future expansion. Second, Western countries and firms could restrict Chinese access to machine tooling and associated design and manufacturing software. While export controls are not completely effective, limiting China’s access to manufacturing equipment would make it far harder for it to build out a domestic industrial base. However, there is an underlying structural challenge in this approach because some machine tools are inherently dual use, making it easier for China to circumvent hypothetical sanctions. As China continues to seek to exploit the global engine market in an effort to gain turbofan manufacturing independence, it is up to policymakers and individual companies to fight back and carefully control the gains China can realize from the global turbofan market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China was able to access — or indigenously develop — enhanced technology, it could begin to close the qualitive edge that the United States and its allies have enjoyed for decades. As the United States shrinks the size of its crewed fighter aircraft fleet in the coming decades, maintaining that edge will be increasingly vital as China’s air dominance fleet expands. If the United States and its allies are unable to safeguard key manufacturing and turbofan technologies, further investments in U.S. and allied turbofan innovation could help to make parity with the West a moving target and blunt Chinese technical and manufacturing advances.&lt;/p&gt;

Beijing’s actions divide U.S. allies and likely deter countries from adopting positions and policies that may draw the ire of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). This could complicate Washington’s ability to push back on problematic Chinese behavior in other domains, including, but not limited to, its human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong and its expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While problematic, China’s economic coercion should be viewed with a sense of perspective; indeed, Beijing’s behavior provides an opportunity to advance U.S. interests in multiple ways.&lt;/strong&gt; A careful analysis of eight cases of Chinese economic coercion since 2010 — against Japan, Norway, the Philippines, Mongolia, South Korea, Australia, Canada, and Lithuania — reveals that the most salient characteristic of China’s economic coercion is that it simply is not very effective. Granted that there is likely a deterrent effect on third countries — albeit hard to quantify — China’s economic coercion nevertheless has a poor track record of achieving its immediate policy aims, and when it does, it often carries long-term costs for China. While Beijing has shown an ability to adapt and escalate when its initial response fails, it also has demonstrated an aversion to incurring costs, at times abandoning coercive measures that become too costly. This may, in part, explain why China’s economic coercion did not impose significant macroeconomic costs on the targeted country in any of the cases examined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic coercion can also counterintuitively work in the interest of the United States. For example, Beijing’s bullying has harmed China’s image around the world, pushing countries closer to the United States. It also creates the perception that China is an unreliable economic partner, which in some cases has prompted allies and firms to adjust their supply chains away from China. A strategy to counter China’s economic coercion should incorporate these nuances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence theory suggests two possible paths for a counterstrategy: punishment and denial. While punishment through tit-for-tat retaliation is superficially appealing, it has several problems. First and foremost, it faces an acute credibility challenge. Because China has so far resisted imposing significant costs on targeted countries, the threat of a proportional response from the United States would be unlikely to impose sufficient costs to alter Beijing’s calculus. However, if the United States threatened an escalatory response, the threat would quickly become noncredible. Retaliation might also unintentionally enhance the legitimacy of China’s economic coercion, which is often presented to the Chinese population in nationalistic terms, and might deprive the United States of the diplomatic moral high ground. Importantly, retaliation is likely not the response that targeted countries want from the United States, as China’s preference for coercing smaller countries means that targeted countries, not the United States, would bear the brunt of any escalation on the part of Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence by denial — focused on resilience and relief for targeted countries — is more likely to mitigate, and over time deter, China’s problematic behavior by decreasing its likelihood of success, frustrating Beijing’s intent. That is, where deterrence by punishment seeks to prevent an action through threat of retaliation, denial achieves its deterrent end by conveying the infeasibility of an action. A counterstrategy premised on deterrence by denial has several advantages over one based on punishment. Most importantly, it is more credible, for two primary reasons: First, a deterrence-by-denial strategy allows the defender to act first, eliminating the advantage China gains from informally implementing its coercive measures and putting the defender on the back foot. Second, providing relief does not require the United States to directly harm its own firms or consumers, as punishment implies. In addition, a strategy premised on deterrence by denial is easier to multilateralize, promotes decoupling where appropriate, provides the United States a more effective diplomatic message, and better aligns with the norms of the international rules-based system the United States aims to uphold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The counterstrategy proposed in this report is based on the logic of deterrence by denial and has two mutually reinforcing components: preemptive “denial” policies that aim to harden vulnerable economies against Chinese economic coercion, and reactive “deflection” policies that aim to negate China’s coercion by providing targeted relief to accelerate market adjustments, minimizing the political and economic pressure China can impose on the target. Together these resilience and relief measures are designed to frustrate Beijing’s intent by making targeted countries less likely to comply and, over time, to deter Beijing from its coercive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, this report recommends that the United States take the following preemptive denial steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish an interagency CoerCom.&lt;/strong&gt; To pool knowledge and resources, coordinate, and centralize U.S. counter-coercion strategies and initiatives, the U.S. government should establish a new interagency committee known as the Committee on Countering Economic Coercion, or CoerCom.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a coercion-denial coalition.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should take the initiative by unilaterally setting up its own counter-coercion policies but encourage other Group of Seven (G7) advanced countries to follow suit, emphasizing denial over punishment. While broadly signaling support for coerced partners, the G7-centered coalition should be cautious about explicitly extending an economic security umbrella too widely, at the risk of losing credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review vulnerabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Governments and firms at risk of coercion should conduct economy-wide reviews to identify potentially vulnerable industries and sectors. The United States can aid allies and partners by providing technical assistance with their vulnerability reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinforce supply chain resiliency.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and allies should make defending against China’s economic coercion an explicit objective of supply chain resilience initiatives such as those that emerged in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negotiate free trade agreements.&lt;/strong&gt; Washington can help strengthen resilience to China’s economic coercion by negotiating trade agreements that offer meaningful market access to allies and partners. This would reduce China’s market power vis-à-vis the United States while also speeding market adjustments in cases of economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a U.S. anti-coercion instrument (USACI).&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should establish an anti-coercion instrument similar to the one under development in the European Union but comprised of new and existing relief tools, including a new coercion compensation fund.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage partners to develop their own authorities.&lt;/strong&gt; Countries vulnerable to economic coercion should preemptively expand the authority of relevant domestic agencies to provide relief to sectors and firms affected when coercion occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following “deflection” steps after an act of coercion are also recommended:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define actionable coercion.&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. president should be given the authority to determine what constitutes an act of economic coercion on a case-by-case basis. CoerCom would provide the president with a recommendation to inform that decision, while Congress would have the ability to overrule the president’s decision with an up-or-down vote.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deploy the USACI:&lt;/strong&gt; Once an incidence of Chinese economic coercion has been positively identified, CoerCom would provide the president with a recommended set of relief policies authorized under the USACI. CoerCom should also be tasked with identifying possible opportunities to incentivize and speed decoupling of the targeted country from China in critical-technology and other strategic sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support World Trade Organization (WTO) cases.&lt;/strong&gt; Whenever possible, the United States should encourage the targeted state to bring a case against China to the WTO, which the United States and other G7 members would sign onto as third parties. Rather than solve the problem by themselves, these cases would signal disapproval by the United States and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance diplomatic messaging.&lt;/strong&gt; In both its denial and deflection efforts, the United States needs to employ robust public diplomacy. Preferably in coordination with other G7 countries, Washington should make public its efforts to build resiliency against China’s economic coercion and to offer relief to targeted partners, causing Beijing to update its assessment of the likelihood of success.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to an effective U.S. deterrence-by-denial strategy is maintaining credibility: offering real incentives to vulnerable countries to strengthen their economic resilience; not overcommitting to respond in all cases or in ways that neither China nor partners find plausible but following through with relief quickly when actionable coercion occurs; and ensuring domestic political support for counter-coercion measures, while visibly working to secure broader allied support. The counterstrategy proposed here may be less immediately satisfying than tit-for-tat retaliation, but it is more likely to deter Beijing from its disruptive behavior over time, while preserving the moral high ground for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Dalai Lama visited Ulaanbaatar in 2016, Beijing canceled bilateral meetings with Mongolia on finance and infrastructure. That same year, Seoul approved deployment of U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile batteries to Korea, prompting Beijing to force approximately 90 percent of Lotte supermarkets on the mainland to close over “fire safety violations.” In 2020, after Canberra called for an investigation into the origin of Covid-19, China restricted imports of Australian wine, beef, and other commodities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China has grown economically, so too has its propensity to engage in economic coercion. Although Beijing’s behavior has often been met with criticism, there has been little coordinated response from the United States or the broader international community. However, even without a response, the effectiveness of China’s economic coercion against states has been decidedly mixed. While Mongolia mostly gave in to Beijing’s demands, apologizing and promising the Dalai Lama would not visit again, the current administration in Seoul has stated it will not abide by the previous administration’s promise to limit certain military activities. Australia remains defiant in the face of China’s coercion and has aligned even more closely with the United States, as seen in the September 2021 announcement of the Australia–United Kingdom–United States (AUKUS) trilateral security agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not to say that China’s use of economic coercion has not been damaging. The deterrent effect of Beijing’s behavior is difficult to quantify. Governments may be less likely to challenge malign Chinese policies — such as military aggression in the South China Sea or human rights abuses — if they believe they will suffer economic losses in key industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s coercive economic measures also have divided allies and cleaved domestic politics in targeted nations. When exports from one country are blocked, a third country often stands to benefit, as was the case when U.S. coal exports to China increased at Australia’s expense. At the same time, private sector industries, which bear the brunt of Chinese economic coercion, lobby their home governments to avoid making statements or implementing policies that might anger Beijing, even at the expense of liberal values and national security. Moreover, China’s behavior undermines the norms that govern the international economic system. Beijing’s capriciousness erodes the trust that underpins international commerce while at the same time damaging the legitimacy of multilateral institutions, which are ill equipped to handle China’s destabilizing economic policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing and deploying a comprehensive counterstrategy to China’s economic coercion presents an opportunity for the United States to strengthen its image on the global stage; uphold the norms and rules of the international economic system; improve its strategic position vis-à-vis China; and mitigate — and over time deter — China’s problematic behavior. Based on insights derived from a careful 16-month review of eight historical and ongoing cases of Chinese economic coercion, two expert roundtables, and a crisis simulation, this report proposes a counterstrategy grounded in the deterrence literature and built upon the two mutually reinforcing components of denial and deflection. Together, these will help the United States deter China’s problematic use of economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-coercion-a-form-of-economic-statecraft&quot;&gt;Economic Coercion: A Form of Economic Statecraft&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic statecraft is the “use of economic means to pursue foreign policy goals.” The tools of economic statecraft vary but most commonly involve leveraging control over the flow of capital or goods to affect the decisions of other states or bolster strategic competitiveness. Out of normal international economic activity emerges economic interdependence, which states can weaponize to achieve strategic rather than commercial ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic statecraft policies may be divided into two primary categories: those that induce and those that punish. Inducements might take the form of trade agreements that offer nations market access or provide development financing to enhance stability. By contrast, punishments are implemented to coerce or corrode the target. In the case of the former, the aim is to influence the actions of the targeted entity and, in the latter, to erode its capabilities. Threats of punishment may also be used to deter adversaries, while their implementation can signal resolve and enhance the credibility of future threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, the line between inducement and punishment is blurry, as interdependencies produced by inducements can create new vulnerabilities to punishments. For example, China can foster warm diplomatic relations by granting access to its large domestic economy or coerce other countries for perceived affronts to Beijing’s prerogatives, while the United States can leverage the global position of the dollar to punish rogue nations and nonstate actors through sanctions or offer development assistance to induce countries to follow Washington’s lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic coercion, then, is best understood as a subcategory of economic statecraft and entails, according to Daniel Drezner, a “threat or act by a sender government or governments to disrupt economic exchange with the target state, unless the target acquiesces to an articulated demand.” It is difficult to measure the effectiveness of economic coercion, but according to the literature on sanctions, the effectiveness of a coercive economic measure weakens after implementation as alternative markets are found, costs rise over time, political coalitions within the sending state fracture, and views of the sending state harden within the target state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the United States and China employ instruments of economic statecraft in coercive ways to achieve desired strategic outcomes, and both have increased their employment in recent years, consistent with the ever-greater precedence placed on geoeconomic competition in the international system. However, there are important distinctions between when, how, and why the two great powers engage in economic coercion (discussed further below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economic-coercion-with-chinese-characteristics&quot;&gt;Economic Coercion with Chinese Characteristics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s history of economic statecraft stretches back centuries. The tributary system, developed under the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and maintained by the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), defined China’s foreign relations on a hierarchical basis and was largely sustained by trade and economic interests. Under the tributary system, economic relations were intimately linked with politics: to access China’s market, foreign envoys were required to pay tribute and kowtow to the Chinese emperor. As the Qing dynasty weakened in the latter half of the nineteenth century, and as the treaty system emerged in the middle of the century, China’s tributary system broke down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even on the brink of collapse in the early twentieth century, with the tributary system dissolved, the Qing dynasty still attempted to use coercive economic measures to achieve foreign policy goals. In 1905 the Qing boycotted U.S. goods in response to U.S. immigration policy. The Republic of China (1912–49) pursued the same policies, and between 1919 and 1930 there were numerous boycotts of foreign powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, China experienced rapid export-driven growth and underwent significant social and economic change. International trade boomed due to reform and opening policies, and China assumed a central role in the globalized economy. It is no surprise that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) (1949–present) continues to employ economic statecraft, including coercion, in pursuit of political goals, especially given China’s comparative advantages in the economic domain. For Beijing, economic coercion offers a relatively low-risk way of asserting its influence and standing up on the international stage for what it perceives as its core interests; coercion is a tool of statecraft that the CCP is actively seeking to sharpen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better illuminate the drivers and characteristics of China’s economic coercion, eight cases were examined in this study; they are summarized below and spelled out in more detail in the annex. The covered cases span roughly the past decade and were chosen because they vary in cause, method, severity, duration, notoriety, and outcome. As such, the cases do not represent a randomized sample.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-1-cases-not-studied&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1. Cases Not Studied&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cases in which Beijing threatened but did not implement coercion are not included in this study, nor are cases where China’s coercion was aimed solely at private firms as an end in itself rather than as a means to affect the policy of a government. The former were omitted because without implementation, there are no data to collect on what coercive tools China prefers, their cost, or their effectiveness. With coercion implemented, it is more straightforward to trace not only China’s but also the targeted government’s decisionmaking. Still, it is important to note that China has a propensity to issue empty threats of economic coercion.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cases of China’s targeting of private firms for perceived offenses are omitted because they represent a different problem set in need of a different solution. Although private firms may be more likely to cave to Chinese economic pressure than governments, they do not formulate public policy. By contrast, governments formulate policy, but they are more insulated from China’s economic coercion. For example, Beijing might target the National Basketball Association (NBA) because of a policy choice of the U.S. government in an effort to manipulate the NBA into pressuring the U.S. government to amend the policy. If successful, this coercion of a private firm would have a real effect on U.S. policy toward China. However, China’s coercion in this case would need to satisfy two conditions to have that effect: first, the NBA would have to acquiesce and pressure the U.S. government, and second, the United States would have to amend its policy because of this pressure. Thus, it does not strictly matter in this case if the NBA acquiesces to Beijing’s position, so long as it does not affect U.S. policy, which it did not in the real-world case in 2019.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Therefore, a counterstrategy aimed at deterring China’s economic coercion of governments is not only more consequential but also does not necessitate preventing firms from acquiescing to Beijing’s demands to be successful. Instead, the objective should be to prevent targeted firms from swaying the targeted government’s position in a direction contrary to U.S. interests — a seemingly trivial but important distinction. That said, China’s targeting of firms for their own perceived transgressions is a common occurrence and, though not the subject of this study, it carries its own different set of costs and is deserving of attention.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;case-study-summaries&quot;&gt;Case Study Summaries&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are brief summaries of the eight case studies examined in this study, in chronological order of the start of each incident. A more complete description of the incidents and their resolutions can be found in the annex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAPAN: FISHING BOAT CAPTAIN ARREST (2010)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2010, a Chinese fishing boat crew was detained by Japan’s Coast Guard and its captain arrested following a chase near the contested Senkaku/Diaoyu Island chain in the East China Sea. After releasing the rest of the crew, Tokyo threatened to indict the captain over his belligerent post-detainment behavior, which challenged agreed protocols between Japan and China over Senkaku-related issues. China implemented a diplomatic freeze, canceled tourism to Japan, and tightened inspections on Japanese imports. China also reportedly began blocking exports of rare earth minerals to Japan. Notably, China had announced in July 2010 that it would curb global exports of rare earths. Four Japanese nationals were also arrested in China, though Tokyo denied that the cases were related. Japan released the captain without charging him. China demanded an official apology, which never came, but lifted the rare earths export ban shortly after. In the wake of the incident, Japan commenced efforts to diversify its rare earths supply chain. Today, the islands remain a source of contention between Japan and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NORWAY: LIU XIAOBO NOBEL PRIZE (2010)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2010, the Oslo-based Nobel Peace Prize committee, composed of five members appointed by Norway’s parliament, selected imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo as the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Seeking to preempt Chinese anger, Norway emphasized the Nobel committee’s independence. Before the Nobel ceremony, China sent letters to foreign dignitaries asking they not attend. China also expressed opposition to the committee’s decision and instituted a diplomatic freeze against Norway, including ceasing free trade talks and blocking the issuance of visas to officials. Afterwards, Norwegian salmon imports to China fell drastically, and Norway was excluded from a program of visa-free travel to Beijing available to all 27 EU members plus Switzerland and Iceland. Salmon exports were largely rerouted through third countries like Vietnam. Relations were normalized in 2016, with China lifting its diplomatic freeze, salmon restrictions, and most other measures. The two countries resumed free trade talks in 2018, but the talks have stalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHILIPPINES: SCARBOROUGH SHOAL (2012)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2012, Chinese and Philippine ships were entangled in a standoff over the Philippines’ attempted arrest of Chinese fishing crews near the contested Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. Manila called for international adjudication of the dispute, but Beijing refused. China began turning away shipments of Philippine bananas, leaving them to rot in port. The refusals, ostensibly related to a pest issue, were also extended to other fruits. China also cut off tourist flows to the Philippines. While an agreement was soon brokered to de-escalate tensions near the shoal, China’s ships did not leave the area. Manila filed suit with the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague. China responded with an import ban on pineapples and bananas, a diplomatic freeze, an enhanced travel advisory, and a fishing ban near the shoal. In 2016 the Hague ruled in the Philippines’ favor, but China rejected the decision. Manila was unable to rally support from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the Philippine president opted not to press the matter. Relations warmed in 2016, though Chinese-promised investments in the Philippines never materialized. The current Philippine president has voiced stronger opposition to China’s South China Sea status and has increased ties with the United States, but he has also shown interest in boosting bilateral economic engagement with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOUTH KOREA: THAAD DEPLOYMENT (2016)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2016, South Korea and the United States announced a plan to install THAAD in South Korea. The purpose of the missile defense system was to guard against the North Korean threat, but China expressed concerns about the system’s potential impact on Chinese national security. Chinese media called for the use of economic measures against Korea, including boycotts of Korean manufacturers Hyundai and Kia. China curbed South Korean cultural exports and reduced tourism. The THAAD batteries were ultimately installed in April 2017 on land procured by the Korean government from Korean conglomerate Lotte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China responded by forcibly closing almost all Lotte stores in China over alleged fire code violations, issuing enhanced travel advisories, halting subsidies for electric vehicles powered by Korean-produced batteries, and restricting commodity imports. Seoul responded by working to boost trade ties with ASEAN and India and by supporting its affected industries and encouraging reshoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relations were normalized following Korea’s October 2017 announcement of the Three Nos: no additional THAAD deployment, no participation in the U.S. missile defense network, and no trilateral alliance with the United States and Japan. The current Korean president campaigned on a harder stance toward China and has downplayed the Three Nos policy, while also working to expand Korea’s trade ties with ASEAN and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MONGOLIA: DALAI LAMA VISIT (2016)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2016, the Dalai Lama visited Mongolia and indicated that a Buddhist patriarchal reincarnation had occurred there. China strongly opposes any visits by the Dalai Lama to foreign countries and maintains a strict system overseeing Buddhist reincarnation matters. Ahead of the 2016 visit, China warned Mongolia not to allow the Dalai Lama a visa. After the visit, China ceased talks covering soft loan negotiations, infrastructure investments, and a debt repayment loan. China also instituted fees and transit costs on commodity shipments at a major border crossing, leading to massive delays. Mongolia soon expressed regret over the situation and indicated it would not invite the Dalai Lama back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUSTRALIA: ANTI–FOREIGN INTERFERENCE LAW/CALL FOR COVID-19 INVESTIGATION (2017/2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, legislation was introduced in the Australian parliament to combat foreign interference in Australian politics. In announcing the legislation and indicating that it was aimed at China, former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull used a famous Mao Zedong saying: “The Chinese people have stood up.” Following complaints from the Chinese government, he repeated it two days later in Mandarin. Beijing responded with a diplomatic freeze, along with reported trade restrictions against Australian beef and wine. Australia-China relations subsequently deteriorated further, with China responding with various trade and diplomatic measures over Canberra’s 2018 blocking of Huawei from domestic 5G infrastructure, the filing of a 2020 World Trade Organization (WTO) antidumping case, and a public call for an independent investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 virus in 2020. China’s measures have included import suspensions or delays of a swath of Australian products, including beef, barley, cotton, wine, timber, lobster, and coal. A list of 14 grievances that Beijing provided Canberra was also leaked in late 2020. The diplomatic freeze ended in November 2022, but trade tensions remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANADA: MENG WANZHOU EXTRADITION (2018)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2018, Huawei chief financial officer (CFO) Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada over a U.S. warrant related to charges of Huawei’s alleged efforts to evade Iran sanctions. The arrest prompted a strong response from Beijing, which detained two Canadian citizens; summoned Canada’s ambassador to China; issued enhanced travel advisories covering Canada; and introduced delays and import curbs on Canadian peas, soybeans, pork, and beef. China also revoked the import licenses of two leading Canadian canola exporters. In response, Canada enhanced its travel advisory covering China, launched a campaign to bring attention to the detention of its citizens, and provided support to its domestic industries. The situation was eventually resolved in 2021 when the two countries swapped prisoners. China also lifted its canola restrictions in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LITHUANIA: TAIWANESE REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE (2021)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2021, Taiwan announced that it would open a Taiwanese Representative Office (TRO) in Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius. Including Taiwan, instead of Taipei, in the name of the office challenged an established norm imposed by Beijing for relations with Taiwan. Lithuania had also recently challenged China in several ways, including withdrawing from the so-called 17+1 initiative. Between the TRO’s announcement and opening, China ceased providing permits for Lithuanian food imports, cut off freight to Lithuania from state-owned company CRCT (though Chinese state media denied that an order had been relayed), and pressured foreign investors operating in Lithuania to lobby against Vilnius’ plan. Lithuanian firms also reported having trouble renewing and closing contracts in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the TRO’s opening, China downgraded diplomatic relations with Lithuania and effectively instituted an embargo. Lithuania’s export-oriented laser industry was especially exposed, and its companies lost market share to competitors from Germany, France, and the Netherlands. In addition, some German firms that sourced components from Lithuania reportedly had their exports to China blocked. The European Union requested consultations at the WTO, and China soon instituted official bans on Lithuanian beef, milk, and beer. EU views toward China have hardened due to the dispute, and Lithuania-Taiwan relations have grown stronger. The European Union has also fast-tracked its anti-coercion instrument (see Box 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-2-eu-anti-coercion-instrument&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 2. EU Anti-coercion Instrument&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The European Commission released the European Union’s proposed anti-coercion instrument (ACI) in December 2021. It aims to deter third-party coercive economic measures leveled against EU member states. To do so, the ACI would authorize the commission to retaliate with a set of punitive economic tools. Potential retaliatory measures include, but are not limited to, restrictions on exports, imports, financial market access, and intellectual property protections, as well as possible increased tariffs and new quotas.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Under the negotiating position of the EU Council that was released in November 2022, the ACI currently stands as follows: The commission first determines whether a member state is experiencing economic coercion based on the legal definition set out in the proposal. The council then affirms the commission’s determination by qualified majority voting. If the council agrees with the commission’s determination, the commission proposes a set of proportional retaliatory measures, which the council votes on for adoption by qualified majority. Throughout the process, the commission must seek or remain open to negotiation with the coercing country. The countermeasures remain in place until the coercion ceases.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The EU Council’s negotiating position represents a dilution of the commission’s power as laid out under the first version of the ACI proposal, which would have granted Brussels authority to unilaterally determine whether coercion is occurring and unilaterally implement countermeasures. The revisions come after some member states expressed concerns that too much centralization in Brussels creates a moral hazard whereby smaller member states less exposed to China’s market may be incentivized to take overly antagonistic positions vis-à-vis Beijing. Supporters of the commission’s position fear that diluting the power of the commission will erode the deterrent effect of the instrument. The EU parliament and the council now must come to an agreement on the ACI before it is implemented through the normal legislative process&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;case-study-key-takeaways-characteristics-of-chinese-coercion&quot;&gt;Case Study Key Takeaways: Characteristics of Chinese Coercion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While each instance of China’s economic coercion is unique, there are certain distinct patterns that emerge across the cases studied:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s use of economic coercion is typically triggered by challenges or threats to territorial integrity, domestic political legitimacy, national security, economic security, and PRC citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beijing’s coercive economic measures are almost always deployed informally and are often accompanied by noneconomic measures, including diplomatic freezes and military posturing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China typically employs economic coercion against smaller economies and in sectors where it possesses an asymmetric advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, China’s economic coercion does not impose significant macroeconomic costs on the targeted countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout and between coercive campaigns, Beijing will often adapt, repurpose, and even withdraw coercive measures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consistent with the academic literature on economic sanctions, China’s economic coercion has generally proven unsuccessful. Where it has led to concessions, Beijing’s tactical success is often accompanied with strategic setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion of each of these characteristics follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIVE TYPES OF TRIGGERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government typically deploys economic coercion in response to perceived provocations rather than direct harm. These triggering events typically fit within one or more of five overlapping categories of perceived challenges or threats: threats to territorial integrity, threats to domestic political legitimacy, threats to national security, threats to economic security, and threats to PRC citizens (Table 1). For example, Japan’s detainment of a Chinese fishing boat captain after a collision with a Japanese coast guard vessel in the contested Senkaku Islands both challenged a Chinese territorial claim and, from Beijing’s perspective, threatened a PRC citizen. Beijing perceived both Norway and Australia as actively undermining the CCP’s political legitimacy when the Oslo-based Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo the Nobel Peace Prize and when Prime Minister Turnbull used what Beijing perceived as inflammatory language in paraphrasing Mao when justifying the anti–foreign interference bill targeting China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Beijing perceived another Australian challenge to its legitimacy in 2020 when Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for an investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 virus. Beijing viewed South Korea’s deployment of THAAD, equipped with radar systems capable of peering into the Chinese mainland, as a threat to its national security. Further, China perceived the arrest of Meng in Vancouver not only as an attack on an important PRC citizen but also part of a larger attack on a national champion critical to China’s economic security, Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1. Triggers and Relevant Cases of Chinese Coercion.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violation of one or more identified triggers is not necessarily sufficient to trigger a coercive response. In fact, many challenges go unmet with coercion from Beijing. Although outside the scope of this report, Ketian Zhang makes the case that this variation in response comes down to a cost-benefit analysis on the part of Beijing. China weighs the trade-off between the need to demonstrate resolve and the economic and geopolitical costs of coercion. In cases where the need to establish resolve on an issue of national interest is high and the economic costs are low, China is most likely to use coercion. When the risk of geopolitical backlash to coercion is high, Beijing prefers to use nonmilitary tools such as economic coercion. This helps explain why, though China’s military has become stronger and more capable over time, China’s use of military coercion has declined while its use of economic coercion has become more frequent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INFORMALITY OF IMPLEMENTATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although China has in recent years begun to develop more formal coercive tools, Beijing has demonstrated a preference for exercising its economic coercion through informal channels. China relies primarily on administrative tools, as well as its influence over domestic state-owned enterprises (SOEs), media, and public opinion. Consequently, its economic coercion is frequently carried out through plausibly deniable means such as the selective enforcement of regulations by customs officials, informal notices to commercial actors encouraging them to undertake particular courses of action, tourism advisories, state-promoted boycotts of foreign corporations, or nationalistic threats from state media outlets such as the Global Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An informal approach to economic coercion carries several advantages. It allows China to take rapid action while retaining an element of ambiguity in its methods and intentions. The plausible deniability afforded by informal measures also allows China to avoid legal challenges, mitigate diplomatic costs, and quickly recalibrate should its coercive measures prove ineffective or too costly. Informality complicates the response of the targeted state, as it can be difficult in legal terms to distinguish state-sanctioned informal coercion from market forces and legitimate policy concerns. This frustrates states that seek recourse through the WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism, which has proven largely inadequate in addressing economic coercion. Advantages aside, it may also be the case that China simply lacks the formal regulatory mechanisms through which to implement its coercive measures, leaving it to rely on informal means. (See discussion below of Beijing’s recent development of more formal tools.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the benefits afforded by an informal approach, informality also has its disadvantages. Most acute is that informality exacerbates the already difficult problems of implementation and enforcement of sanctions. With no clear legal authority or regulatory prohibition, opportunistic firms, or those with the right connections, may decide to ignore or circumvent Beijing’s dictates, diluting the effect of China’s economic coercion. For example, Lithuanian laser firms reported that orders of equipment needed for scientific work were still being placed by major Chinese universities. A related problem is that without formal processes to justify its policies, China’s informal sanctions lack the imprimatur of legitimacy that formal measures carry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The informality of China’s approach is present across all of the cases explored above. After Canadian authorities arrested Meng, Beijing justified its restriction and enhanced inspections of Canadian canola imports on the detection of pests, while the trade restrictions placed on Norwegian salmon and Philippine bananas were likewise justified on sanitary and phytosanitary grounds. In the 2012 Japanese rare earths case, China appeared to place an unofficial embargo on rare earths exports to Japan just one day after Japanese prosecutors announced their intention to prosecute a Chinese fishing boat captain. While officials in Beijing flatly denied the existence of an embargo, flows of rare earth materials to Japan reportedly resumed five days after the captain’s release. Likewise, when the TRO opened in Vilnius, Lithuania simply disappeared as an option in China’s customs database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although China tries to maintain an element of plausible deniability in its implementation of coercive economic measures, Beijing will often obliquely link its coercive policies to the perceived offense. In cases where the offending policy decision was telegraphed beforehand, such as in Mongolia, Lithuania, Norway, and Japan, Beijing warned that taking the action in question would harm relations. Likewise, in some cases, China will communicate to the targeted country what it could do to normalize relations, as in the case of the 14 grievances with Australia and after Canada’s arrest of Meng, when Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested that releasing Meng would help resolve “the situation of the two Canadians.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Beijing has unveiled a number of formal economic coercion instruments. These include the Chinese Ministry of Commerce’s (MOFCOM) 2019 announcement of an unreliable entities list, mirroring the U.S. entity list; a unified export control law passed by the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) in October 2020; foreign sanctions blocking rules issued by MOFCOM in January 2021; and a more comprehensive Anti-foreign Sanctions Law passed by NPCSC in June 2021. While Beijing has thus far largely refrained from deploying its new economic coercion instruments, their existence threatens to put multinational corporations with a footprint in China in a legal bind that could raise the perceived cost of additional sanctions targeting China. They may also signal China’s desire to bring more formality to its economic statecraft. In January 2023, MOFCOM and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) reportedly began “seeking public comment on adding some manufacturing methods key to producing advanced solar wafers on to its list of technologies it prohibits exporting,” indicating that Beijing may be edging closer to using its formal instruments, at least in a defensive manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEPLOYMENT OF NONECONOMIC COERCIVE MEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing often deploys a portfolio of various noneconomic coercive techniques, both symmetric and asymmetric, in its efforts to pressure target countries. Among these are hostage diplomacy, nonviolent military/paramilitary coercion, diplomatic sanctions, and cyberattacks (Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hostage Diplomacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has demonstrated a troubling pattern across several cases of mixing economic coercion with hostage diplomacy. In addition to restricting Canadian agricultural imports, China detained Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig shortly after the arrest of Meng and released them nearly three years later only after the Huawei CFO obtained permission to return to China. Likewise, after detaining the fishing boat captain, Japan not only found its rare earth imports curtailed but also saw four Japanese businessmen barred from returning to Japan until Beijing deemed the issue resolved with the captain’s release. More recently, in the case of Lithuania, some have speculated that Beijing timed its reaction to the opening of the TRO in Vilnius with the return of the Lithuanian ambassador to Beijing. The ambassador then underwent a weeks-long Covid-19 quarantine that carried the implicit threat of further detention. Over the course of its years-long dispute with Canberra, Beijing detained two Australian citizens on suspicious grounds and upgraded the sentence of an Australian citizen imprisoned for drug trafficking to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nonviolent Military/Paramilitary Coercion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also flexed its military might alongside its economic power. During the 2012 dispute with the Philippines over the Scarborough Shoal, Beijing dispatched Chinese maritime surveillance ships as well as an armed coast guard vessel to the disputed waters while simultaneously blocking Philippine banana exports to China on sanitary grounds. After Japan detained the Chinese fishing boat captain, Beijing increased the number of Chinese maritime law enforcement patrols in the vicinity of the disputed Senkaku Islands. South Korea witnessed increased Chinese military aircraft incursions into its air identification zone as well as live fire drills and a Chinese missile weapons test in Bohai Sea after the deployment of THAAD. While not included in the case studies above, Beijing responded to U.S. house speaker Nancy Pelosi’s August 2022 visit to Taiwan with both import bans on agriculture products and unprecedented military exercises in the waters surrounding Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diplomatic Sanctions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic coercion is often accompanied with some form of diplomatic sanction. In the case of Norway and Australia, this amounted to a complete diplomatic freeze. Lithuania saw its diplomatic status downgraded from ambassadorship to chargé d’affaires, and Beijing recalled its own ambassador from Vilnius. After the Dalai Lama visit, China postponed upcoming bilateral meetings with Mongolia, and in the Senkakus dispute with Japan, China first suspended East China Sea oil and gas negotiations and then canceled parliamentary exchanges before suspending bilateral exchanges altogether. During the dispute over the Scarborough Shoal, China canceled high-level bilateral visits and held no formal meetings with the Philippine foreign ministry between 2013 and 2015. China also reportedly recalled its invitation to Philippine president Benigno Aquino for the China-ASEAN trade fair. In addition, Beijing canceled high-level meetings with South Korean officials, including the defense minister, following the 2016 THAAD deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberattacks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks have been another coercive tool deployed by Beijing alongside economic coercion. In the months following the opening of the TRO, Lithuanian intelligence reported, “China is increasingly using its cyber capabilities against Lithuania.” In the Scarborough Shoal dispute, Chinese hackers defaced the websites of the University of the Philippines, the Department of Budget and Management, and the Philippine News Agency. Just three weeks after awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Committee’s website was hit with a cyberattack. In the years that followed the decision, Norway was also targeted more frequently by cyberattacks originating in China than its Nordic neighbors; however, it is unclear how much of that was the result of the Nobel Peace Prize decision. South Korea and Canada likewise saw upticks in cyberattacks following the former’s decision to permit the deployment of THAAD and the latter’s arrest of Meng.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PREFERENCE FOR TARGETING RELATIVELY SMALL ECONOMIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the cases surveyed, China displays a preference for using economic coercion against relatively small economies. With the exception of Japan, no coerced country’s gross domestic product (GDP) exceeds 15 percent of China’s, while two of the countries — Mongolia and Lithuania — do not even amount to 1 percent of China’s GDP combined (Table 3). China’s preference for targeting smaller countries is likely a consequence of several factors. The targeting of smaller countries helps ensure the secondary impact of China’s measures on its own industries is limited. In addition, smaller countries are often more vulnerable to Beijing’s measures, as trade accounts for a greater share of their GDP. Finally, from a deterrence and credibility perspective, it is more important that China demonstrates resolve in disputes with small countries so as to not appear weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8iLfKR1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 3. Size of Targeted Economies Relative to China.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators&quot;&gt;“World Development Indicators,” World Bank&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s targeting of Japan is a notable deviation from the pattern demonstrated across the other seven cases. However, there are several possible explanations for why China would turn its coercive measures on Japan, despite the size of its economy. First, the atrocities committed by Japan’s military regime against China during World War II makes Sino-Japanese relations uniquely sensitive. When Japan, from Beijing’s perspective, challenged a Chinese territorial claim and mistreated PRC citizens, China could not be seen to back down or would risk domestic nationalist backlash. Therefore, the need for resolve was high. At the same time, Japan was highly dependent on Chinese rare earth exports, which China was already looking to curtail for economic, strategic, and environmental purposes unrelated to the Senkakus dispute. Therefore, the economic cost of curtailing rare earth exports to Japan was to some degree already factored into Chinese policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that China has shown a particular aversion to targeting the United States with its economic coercion. The United States has on numerous occasions taken actions that could have triggered a coercive response from Beijing, but instead the response was weak, nonexistent, or aimed at a smaller ally or partner of the United States. For example, when Pelosi traveled to Taiwan to demonstrate Congress’s support for the island and its democracy, it was Taiwan, not the United States, that bore the brunt of China’s coercive measures. China’s sole direct response to the United States was limited to canceling channels of engagement on issues like climate and counternarcotics trade. Even other large economies, like France, have faced higher costs than the United States for similar actions Beijing perceives as an offense. For example, in 1992, the PRC government closed the French consulate and French Trade Commission in Guangzhou and excluded French firms from contract bidding in response to the French transfer of frigates to Taiwan. In that same span of time, Beijing appeared to have restrained itself from taking similar actions toward the United States despite the latter’s more frequent and expansive history of defense transfers to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is the 2019 addition of Huawei to the U.S. Department of Commerce entity list under the administration of U.S. president Donald J. Trump. The move directly challenged the core business operations of the Chinese telecoms giant, and while Beijing condemned the listing, it did not retaliate against the United States directly. Instead, China threatened coercion against foreign companies (not just those based in the United States) by announcing a notional unreliable entities list, analogous to the U.S. entity list. Likewise, Beijing’s response to the recent spate of export controls that the administration of U.S. president Joe Biden has placed on semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment has been similarly muted — though the aforementioned recent reporting suggests China may be considering retaliating against the United States by placing export restrictions on solar technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TARGETED AT POLITICALLY INFLUENTIAL OR SYMBOLIC INDUSTRIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing appears to target industries as much for their political importance as for their economic impact. By targeting industries with influential lobbies, Beijing aims to put political pressure on the target, increasing the likelihood of acquiescence to Beijing’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Philippines, China targeted Philippine banana exporters through inspection delays and suspensions. For the Philippines, bananas are a strategic export, and banana farmers, largely based on the southern island of Mindanao, wield significant political influence. The import suspensions threatened farmers’ livelihoods by interrupting strict business cycles. The banana lobby urged the Philippines government to appease Beijing in order to alleviate the situation. By putting economic pressure on influential industries, Beijing translates its economic leverage into domestic political pressure in the target country. Even if the economic impact of a coercive measure can be weathered by a target country, it may be more difficult for that country to withstand the increased domestic political pressure from powerful interest groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Lithuania, the Chinese government pivoted to targeting German firms in an effort to exert greater political pressure on Vilnius to acquiesce. Meanwhile, Norway found its globally prominent farmed salmon industry in China’s crosshairs. Australia’s wine industry, one of the largest in the world, was hit with tariffs of over 200 percent, losing access to its most lucrative market in China. Wine grapes are grown across Australia, and Australia’s powerful agriculture lobby represents their growers. In general, agriculture and commodities lobbies are politically influential. In addition to the Philippines, Norway, and Australia, China targeted agricultural products and commodities in Canada, Mongolia, Australia, and Lithuania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INSIGNIFICANT COST AT THE MACROECONOMIC LEVEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its size advantage, China so far has proven unwilling — or possibly unable — to impose significant economy-wide costs on the targeted country. That is not to say that China’s economic coercion has not imposed any costs. It has been costly for targeted firms such as South Korea’s Lotte, which suffered an estimated $1.78 billion in damages due to China’s coercive actions. The reduction in Chinese tourist visits also hit Korea’s tourism sector particularly hard, with some estimates placing the cost as high as $15.6 billion, as fewer Chinese tourists spent money shopping, dining, and lodging in South Korean establishments. However, there is reason to believe this estimate is overstated, as the underlying study fails to account for potential increases in non-Chinese tourism. For example, another study found that although arrivals of Chinese tourists to Jeju Island declined by 46 percent in March 2017, an influx of domestic tourists led to an increase in the total number of tourists visiting Jeju for that month. In addition, the Bank of Korea estimated South Korea’s GDP growth was just 0.4 percent less than it would have been absent China’s coercive economic measures. For context, the sanctions literature points to 2 percent of gross national product (GNP) as the threshold cost for sanctions to begin to have effect on the target. The U.S.-led multilateral sanctions regime that brought Iran to the negotiating table during the administration under U.S. president Barack Obama cut Iran’s GDP by 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s import restrictions have also led to decreases in trade in the targeted sectors between China and the targeted state. For example, the value of Canada’s exports to China declined $4 billion in 2019. Australia’s exports to China also decreased by approximately $4 billion dollars in the targeted sectors in the year following the call by Canberra for an investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 virus. Likewise, Norway saw a reduction in total exports to China of between $780 million and $1.3 billion between 2011 and 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while these declines may be costly for the affected sectors, the costs represent only a fraction of each country’s total value of exports. For context, Canada’s total exports were valued at $447 billion in 2019, while Australia’s were valued at $245 billion in 2020. Norway’s total exports reached $160 billion in 2011. In addition, trade diversion helps further offset the macroeconomic costs of China’s economic coercion. Canadian canola found its way to China via the United Arab Emirates; Norwegian salmon made an additional stop in Vietnam; and Australian coal was rerouted to markets in India, Japan, and South Korea. In fact, the Australian Department of the Treasury estimated that Australian exporters offset the $4 billion decline in exports to China with an increase of $3.3 billion of exports to new markets. Thus, the net loss due to China’s coercion was just 0.25 percent of the value of Australian exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, China’s coercion also has had little impact on the overall bilateral structure of trade with the target country. What is surprising is that in some cases trade between China and the target country actually increased during the coercive campaign. For example, South Korean exports to China went up by approximately 14 percent in 2017 amid the dispute over the THAAD deployment. In addition, a $7 billion investment by Samsung in its Xi’an operations was allowed to go through unimpeded. Indeed, China largely avoided targeting Korea’s export of intermediate inputs, which account for approximately 70 percent of Korea’s exports to China. Likewise, the overall value of Australian exports to China increased by 10 percent following Australia’s call for an investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 virus, and Norwegian trade with China reached a historic high in 2015. As was the case with Samsung, China also did not block ChemChina’s $2 billion purchase of a Norwegian silicon producer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEPLOYED IN CASES OF ASYMMETRIC ADVANTAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing prefers to target sectors where it has both an asymmetric advantage in the structure of trade and in which protectionist measures can directly benefit domestic constituencies. At the time China cut off its rare earth exports to Japan in 2010, Japan depended on China for more than 90 percent of its rare earth imports. The move to curtail rare earth exports appeared to garner domestic political support in China, as it corresponded to state initiatives to limit production that had preceded the Senkakus incident as part of a broader rethink of the environmental, economic, and strategic benefits of a more disciplined export strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing also appears to settle on imports for which it can easily find substitutes. Although China depended on Canada for more than 90 percent of its canola imports, it managed to make up for its losses by increasing imports from Russia, Ukraine, and the United Arab Emirates, and by dipping into its strategic agricultural reserves. Beijing also may have hoped the embargo would spur increased domestic production of rapeseed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China tends to target commodities in which it enjoys relatively low import dependency and can access an abundance of global suppliers while avoiding escalation in areas where it relies heavily on a handful of trading partners. Here the contrast between Beijing’s treatment of Australian coal and iron ore is instructive. China occupies near-monopsony status for Australian exporters of iron ore, accounting for nearly 80 percent of all Australian export sales in 2021. But although Australia cannot afford to lose the Chinese market, Beijing appears reluctant to exploit this interdependency — perhaps aware of the risks to economic growth, especially in the critical downstream infrastructure and property sectors, that a sudden halt to iron ore imports could pose for China. The global iron ore market is dominated by a handful of large producers in Australia and Brazil, who collectively dwarf Chinese domestic supply. From 2016 to 2020, China’s import dependency on iron ore averaged a staggering 80 percent, with Australian imports accounting for well over half of the total. In 2021, even amid heightened trade tensions, Australia continued to supply over 60 percent of China’s overseas iron ore purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, from 2007 to 2019, China’s import dependency in coal consistently remained below 10 percent. Moreover, China produces by far the most coal of any country in the world, with ex-China supply divided up among a long tail of smaller producing countries, among which Australia is an important but not indispensable provider. Even during a period of spiking demand and energy rationing in late 2020, the Chinese government allegedly persisted in blocking large quantities of Australian coal from entering its ports. That Beijing refrained from meddling with shipments of Australian iron ore implies certain limits to the Chinese leadership’s risk tolerance in weaponizing its buying power. Even when it holds a dominant share of global demand for a particular commodity, China may avoid direct confrontation if it lacks sufficient flexibility to ensure continued access for itself — especially if the commodity in question is vital to its investment-centric economic model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2017 editorial in the Global Times made explicit the case for asymmetrical targeting, arguing in response to South Korea’s announcement of THAAD deployment: “To the greatest extent possible, sanctions towards Korea must identify the areas where [we] can deliver significant unilateral losses to Korea, or those where the particular scope of damage to Korea is disproportionately larger than damage to China.” This asymmetry was reflected in Chinese targeting of Lotte stores, for which Chinese alternatives on the mainland existed, and tourism, as Chinese tourists made up the largest number of foreign visitors to South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INNOVATION, ADAPTABILITY, AND RISK AVERSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China has increasingly turned to economic coercion, Chinese policymakers have shown a propensity to experiment, refining their coercive tools and applying the lessons learned from one coercion campaign to the next. As a result, China has developed an expansive repertoire of coercive measures, which are often used in various combinations to affect the same target (Table 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/m080OCK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8veaTqS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 4. Tools and Relevant Cases of Chinese Economic Coercion.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has demonstrated risk aversion in its deployment of its coercive economic measures. Indeed, China’s preference for economic tools over military tools is in part driven by a desire to limit escalatory risk. Likewise, when selecting sectors to target, China will often choose sectors in which it has some prior experience of manipulating commercial flows. For instance, prior to the Meng case, China had restricted Canada’s canola exports in both 2009 and 2016. Similarly, Chinese inspection authorities first flagged Philippine banana exports for sanitary concerns in March 2012, a month before the Scarborough Shoal dispute began in earnest. Philippine officials noted that the timing of China’s import stoppage was well planned and was likely indicative of the use of a targeting “template.” In focusing its coercive measures on previously targeted imports and commodities, Beijing gravitates toward tactics that proved effective in the past at an acceptable domestic cost. There is also the added benefit of enhanced plausible deniability: Beijing can better distance its actions from the political dispute at hand by pointing to a track record of prior regulatory interventions against a given class of imported product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China avoids implementing coercive tools that are costly domestically. For example, despite Australia’s asymmetric dependence on China’s market for its iron ore exports, China did not put restrictions on this critical sector of the Australian economy as it would have proven extremely costly for Beijing as well. When the domestic costs of coercive policies grow too expensive, China has adapted by dialing back or abandoning coercive measures, as was the case when Beijing lifted restrictions on Canadian pork imports after African swine fever decimated China’s domestic swine herds. However, when its coercive economic policies fail to achieve their intended effect, China has also shown willingness to escalate, both vertically and horizontally, and to experiment with novel tactics. The ongoing dispute with Lithuania exemplifies both characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lead-up to the Lithuanian government’s decision to open a TRO in Vilnius, China had been slowly applying economic pressure, first by cutting off credit insurance for Lithuanian counterparts of Chinese firms and then by blocking timber and grain exports. After the offending office finally opened, China intensified the pressure by effectively cutting off all trade with Lithuania. However, China’s initial punitive measures exerted little economic pain owing to the minimal amount of direct trade between the two countries: Lithuania’s exports to China account for just 1 percent of its total exports, and its imports from China make up just 3 percent of total imports. Beijing adapted by threatening informal secondary sanctions — a novel tactic — on European, primarily German, firms that sourced products from Lithuanian suppliers. This tactic led some European voices to call for Lithuania to back down and prompted the Lithuanian president to express regret over the name choice. However, Vilnius ultimately held firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOME TACTICAL VICTORIES BUT FREQUENT STRATEGIC SETBACKS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithuania’s refusal to back down reveals a final characteristic of China’s economic coercion: its frequent ineffectiveness. The TRO in Vilnius still bears its name. Australia likewise remains defiant and has only more closely aligned its foreign policy with U.S. policy through the creation of AUKUS. Where countries have acquiesced to China’s demands, China’s tactical victories have proven ephemeral and often come with a strategic cost for China. South Korea’s current president, for example, has criticized the Three Nos policy that his predecessor used to distance himself from the United States and has promised to pursue a tougher line against China while continuing the former administration’s initiative to reduce Korea’s economic dependence on China. Japan continues efforts to reorient its rare earth supply chains away from China, while Canada’s government has blocked Huawei from entering its 5G networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mongolia and the Philippines represent two cases where China’s coercion achieved some mixed success. However, neither campaign was costless for Beijing. Even though Mongolia was facing an economic recession and is located precariously between Russia and China, it was not deterred by China’s initial threats of economic coercion and still allowed the Dalai Lama to visit. Likewise, although Mongolia quickly capitulated to Beijing’s demands after the visit, China’s coercive campaign seems to have contributed to the election of the more anti-China candidate in Mongolia’s 2017 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic coercion was arguably more successful against the Philippines, preventing the arrest of Chinese crew members and securing control of the Scarborough Shoal. However, China’s coercion prompted the Philippines to challenge China’s territorial claims at the Hague, which ruled against China, undermining the legitimacy of its activities in the South China Sea. More recently, the Philippines announced it would allow the U.S. military access to four additional bases, reflecting a balancing back toward the United States in the face of an increasingly assertive Beijing. In addition, the mixing of military and economic tools makes it difficult to tease out causality, a task made even more difficult by the radical foreign policy shift toward greater engagement with China initiated by then-president Duterte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 5 offers a summary assessment of Beijing’s success in advancing its tactical and strategic interests in the eight cases of coercion studied. A narrative explanation of these assessments is included in the annex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEATURES MAKING CHINESE COERCION LESS EFFECTIVE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The literature shows that sanctions, in general, tend to be ineffective regardless of the country of origin. Moreover, many of the elements that contribute to sanctions’ effectiveness are not present in China’s use of economic coercion. In fact, several features of Chinese coercion undermine its effectiveness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unilateral instead of Multilateral&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China deploys its economic coercion unilaterally. Without multilateral buy-in, markets eventually adjust, eroding the impact of China’s sanctions. In contrast, sanctions implemented multilaterally are more effective, as it makes it more difficult for the targeted state to find new markets, increases the magnitude and duration of the cost, and grants the sanctions greater legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Low Cost Imposed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although “there is no one-to-one correlation,” the greater the costs imposed by sanctions, the more likely they will be effective, especially if deployed against a weaker country. However, China’s economic coercion thus far has not imposed severe economy-wide costs on the target country — in part because of its unilateralism but also due to China’s own risk and cost aversions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Economic and Political Strength of Target&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China targets smaller countries, these countries are not necessarily weak. The majority of the countries surveyed for this report have healthy economies and political systems. The two exceptions, arguably, are Mongolia, which was facing a recession at the time of the Dalai Lama’s visit, and the Philippines, which suffers from systemic political corruption. These are also the two cases in which China’s economic coercion was most successful at achieving its policy goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Targeting of Adversaries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of China’s economic coercion is also likely muted by its propensity to target adversarial countries rather than friendly ones. Sanctions are typically less effective against the former than the latter. On the one hand, when aimed at adversaries, sanctions tend to entrench the targeted countries’ negative views of the sanctioning regime, strengthening resolve. On the other hand, friendly countries value maintaining their relationship with the sending country and, therefore, are more likely to acquiesce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Poor Signaling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The informal nature of China’s economic coercion complicates signaling. Coercion is most effective when demands are clearly linked to reasonable and limited goals. However, if China explicitly ties its coercion to a trigger, this could undermine its plausible deniability. The informality of China’s coercion also seems to complicate its deterrent effect, as China is unable to say explicitly what the punishment will be for a transgression, instead preferring to speak in generalities about the damage an unwanted act or policy will do to bilateral relations with the target state. To be sure, the opposite could also be argued, in that the ambiguity surrounding the triggers of economic coercion may make countries more cautious about violating China’s core interest. China also has proven consistent in ceasing its coercion when desired concessions are made. In fact, the lack of clear signaling about what those concessions are may give China more room to negotiate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lack of Adequate Inducements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coupling sanctions with inducements can increase their effectiveness. China has attempted to do this but not always with great effect. For example, in the Norway case study, it was arguably the opportunity to resume free trade negotiations with China that prompted Oslo to issue the apology rather than the import restrictions on salmon, which by that time were imposing little, if any, cost on Norway. Likewise, after then-president Duterte decided to pursue reconciliation with China, Beijing announced $24 billion in investments in the Philippines. However, Philippines-China relations soured again after much of this failed to materialize, while Norway-China trade negotiations have since broken down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY CHINA CONTINUES TO COERCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China’s use of economic coercion is often inimical to its own strategic interest, the question arises: Why does China continue to engage in this behavior? Economic coercion sends a signal of resolve, and for every country that chooses to maintain its course in the face of Chinese pressure, many others might quietly adjust their policies to remain in Beijing’s good graces. While the counterfactual cannot be known, the CCP may persist in using such techniques despite their seeming ineffectiveness, at least in part because it values their highly intangible deterrent effect. This too would help explain China’s preference for disproportionate, rather than measured, responses. An example must be made by “killing the chickens to scare the monkey,” to quote the Chinese idiom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While again recognizing the difficulty of quantifying the effects of deterrence, it is far from clear that China’s economic coercion is an effective deterrent. China certainly has success cases. Nineteen states declined to attend the 2010 Nobel ceremony at Beijing’s request, for example. Nevertheless, in several cases, states targeted by China’s economic coercion have continued to pursue policies that run contrary to Beijing’s interests. Australia, for example, banned Huawei from its 5G networks, called for an investigation into the origin of the Covid-19 virus, and joined AUKUS. Canada likewise banned Huawei from its networks. Several other countries followed suit. While there may be a general, if difficult to measure, perception that states avoid making statements about China’s human rights abuses in places such as Xinjiang and Hong Kong out of fear of China’s retribution, there is also a measurable decline in public opinion of China around the world — for which Beijing’s bullying behavior may be at least partially to blame and which hypothetically should make it politically easier for politicians to stand up to China, diluting the deterrent effect of its economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the unclear deterrent effect, China’s seemingly counterproductive use of economic coercion might also be understood through the logic of “appropriateness” rather than the logic of “consequence.” States, like individuals, act not just according to expected outcomes but also based on the values they hold, regardless of the consequences. China increasingly views itself as a major power and therefore feels it cannot abide slights or challenges from lesser powers. In Beijing’s view, such provocations demand a response. The logic-of-appropriateness framework, in combination with China’s risk aversion, also helps explain Beijing’s preference for targeting small countries: just as small states are less likely to escalate, insubordination from small states is more intolerable to self-defined great powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with Chinese president Xi Jinping’s centralization of power, China has become more nationalistic. Its leaders have become even more sensitive to challenges to CCP legitimacy. The triggers of China’s economic coercion all relate to the party’s declared core interests. In a more nationalistic domestic political environment, failure to respond with sufficient force could challenge the careers of individual officials as well as the CCP’s domestic legitimacy. Therefore, although China’s use of economic coercion may impede its foreign policy objectives, to the extent that it also enhances the regime’s domestic legitimacy, Beijing may consider the diplomatic costs manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Beijing’s use of economic coercion is likely to continue. Through its dual circulation strategy, the CCP hopes to enhance China’s position in the global economy, deepen its resilience to external shocks, and gain economic leverage over its trading partners by reshaping global supply chains and boosting domestic consumption. At the same time, Chinese political rhetoric has steadily grown more nationalistic. Bolstered by the ever-improving capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), and with major political anniversaries looming, the party’s sensitivity to challenges to its core interests — especially its one-China principle — will likely increase. If China’s power continues expanding, Beijing will find it even less appropriate to tolerate slights from other smaller states. Assuming geopolitical tensions between the United States and China continue apace, a risk-averse Beijing will likely continue to prefer economic tools to more escalatory military ones in its efforts to coerce other states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China’s use of economic coercion is likely to proliferate in tandem with its economic power, how might its approaches to coercion evolve? First, Beijing may seek to expand its still-limited arsenal of formal coercion instruments, such as the Unreliable Entity List and Anti-foreign Sanctions Law. So far, the effect of such tools has been largely symbolic, with China’s leaders seemingly reluctant to antagonize foreign companies at scale — but this could change. While this greater degree of formalization could hinder China’s ability to adapt to changing circumstances and constrain its attempts to project ambiguity, increased use of formal measures could also complement informal pressures in ways that amplify the deterrent effect of China’s coercion tactics. Formality might also enhance enforcement and provide China’s coercive measures with greater legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing is also likely to continue to use economic coercion in conjunction with noneconomic tools, as shown in the PLA’s ramped-up exercises in the waters around Taiwan following Speaker Pelosi’s visit. Further, China may grow more comfortable in challenging the policies of larger countries, as shown by its de facto secondary sanctions against German companies in the case of Lithuania. The dual circulation framework indicates that China will likely continue to seek out sectors of target economies of high political salience where China enjoys an asymmetric advantage and can readily find substitute sources of supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As the world’s largest economy and holder of the world’s reserve currency, the United States practices economic coercion. However, the United States’ coercive conduct differs from China’s in many important ways.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Unlike China, the United States conducts its coercive economic policies through formal legal instruments that typically allow for some form of judicial review. For example, policy guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) allows, under certain circumstances, sanctioned persons whose assets have been frozen to access a portion of those blocked funds to cover their sanctions-related legal fees. Whether economic coercion methods are initiated via executive order, the executive branch’s multistep rulemaking process, or congressional action, the U.S. government tends to publicly cite a legal basis and policy rationale, name the affected parties, and offer some form of written guidance for compliance.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the post-9/11 era, the United States has used financial sanctions as its coercive tool of choice, reflecting its centrality in the international monetary system. This contrasts with China’s preference for restricting access to its large domestic market, reflecting its comparative advantage in the global economy. Where China’s coercion has largely targeted democratic countries and private firms in response to perceived violations of China’s core interests, the United States primarily targets authoritarian governments, state sponsors of terrorism, and individuals and groups involved in criminal activity or human rights abuses. Also unlike China, which acts unilaterally, the United States prefers to act in concert with allies and partners. A recent example is the multilateral sanctions package levied on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. However, it is important not to gloss over the tensions U.S. economic coercion can create between the United States and its allies and the fact that the United States will act unilaterally at times.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Even before the Trump administration launched a trade war against the European Union when the United States placed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, U.S. allies and partners were the target of U.S. economic coercion, primarily via U.S. secondary sanctions. These controversial sanctions target foreign entities that transact with the original subject of a U.S. sanction in an effort to coerce multilateral cooperation and enhance the economic effect of the primary sanction. Secondary sanctions differ from other types of U.S. economic coercion, not only in their targets but also in that they are designed to have a deterrent effect rather than punish or obtain a change in the target’s behavior, which is the primary object in most instances of U.S. economic coercion. Although President Biden has sought to reemphasize allied cooperation after the unilateralism of the Trump years, with some notable successes, his administration has nevertheless demonstrated a willingness to act alone. The recent sweeping set of export controls blocking the sale of advanced semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China are a notable example.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The export controls on semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment from October 7, 2022, also highlight the increasing centrality of export controls in U.S. economic coercion. The Trump administration made use of export controls to target China’s techno-industrial base, starting with telecom giants Huawei and ZTE, before eventually deploying them against hundreds of firms with alleged ties to the Chinese military. The Biden administration has systematized and expanded the use of this tactic, with national security adviser Jake Sullivan arguing, “Technology export controls . . . can be a new strategic asset in the U.S. and allied tool kit.” His remarks followed the Biden administration’s use of export controls to deprive the Russian military of technologies and components needed to sustain military operations and previewed the more aggressive turn the administration was about to take against Beijing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In contrast to the United States, China has rarely used export restrictions in its coercive campaigns. The curtailment of rare earth exports to Japan and, to a lesser extent, the trade embargo of Lithuania are notable exceptions. The United States, thanks to its central position in high-tech supply chains, can also make use of the foreign-direct product rule (FDPR) to strengthen the effectiveness of its export controls. Much like secondary sanctions, the FDPR allows the United States to coerce multilateral cooperation by threatening to sanction exporters of products that contain U.S. technology or components.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As the world’s two largest economies, both the United States and China leverage their economic power to advance strategic goals and defend their national interests. However, there are important differences between why and how these two countries use economic coercion. These differences reflect not only the two countries’ differing comparative economic advantages, but also their different values and the United States’ access to a strong network of allies. In sum, U.S. economic coercion is more transparent, is grounded in domestic law, and often strives for multilateral implementation, even if that multilateralism requires coercion.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-a-counterstrategy&quot;&gt;Toward a Counterstrategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has publicly stated a desire to “identify and address economic coercion.” According to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the United States seeks a future where “countries are secure from coercion and aggression” and work to “stand together with others against economic coercion and intimidation.” U.S. ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel has been a leading voice in the administration on this issue. Commenting for this study, Ambassador Emanuel offered these thoughts on countering China’s coercion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China is increasingly deploying its economic muscle on behalf of political objectives, and there are no signs it will abandon economic coercion as a tool of statecraft. The evidence is clear. The policy tools vary. The current international response is lacking. Our policy toolkit needs updating. Clarifying authorities to support foreign partners will help us win this battle. By working with a coalition to support victims quickly, we show the value of a rules-based order and U.S. leadership. Economic coercion requires a collective response, and the coalition must be led by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress too has taken an interest in the issue. In the last Congress, legislation was introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate directing the White House to create an interagency task force dedicated to countering China’s economic coercion. This language was also included in the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, which will establish a task force led by the National Security Council. The new Congress has also seen legislation addressing China’s economic coercion reintroduced. Drawing on the lessons from the case studies in part one, this report contributes to the emerging policy debate on how best to counter China’s economic coercion by putting forward a counterstrategy for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-economic-coercion-and-us-interests&quot;&gt;China’s Economic Coercion and U.S. Interests&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any strategy to counter Chinese economic coercion must begin with a clear articulation of how China’s coercion impacts U.S. interests. While it is generally assumed China’s coercive actions run contrary to U.S. interests, a closer examination reveals a more complex relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s coercion challenges the rules-based international economic system that has allowed the United States, its allies and partners, and China itself to prosper in the post–Cold War era. China’s economic coercion can also divide U.S. allies and partners as firms in friendly countries often stand to benefit commercially from the economic pain inflicted on the targeted country. While it is difficult to know how powerful the deterrent effect is, fear of economic retaliation may make it more difficult for the United States to build coalitions that push back against China’s human rights abuses and territorial violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterintuitively, China’s use of economic coercion also intersects with U.S. interests. As China gains strength, its use of that strength to coerce smaller countries has harmed its global image. In addition, a new consensus in Washington has emerged regarding economic relations with China. During the Trump administration, decoupling in strategic sectors was controversial, but under the Biden administration, targeted decoupling has been formalized, systematized, and expanded. There is now strong bipartisan consensus that at least some decoupling from China is in the interest of the United States, with the debate shifting to how much and how best to achieve that. China’s use of coercion drives decoupling as countries and firms rethink their dependency on the Chinese market and seek to mitigate risk in the face of Beijing’s capricious and arbitrary behavior. Although there are limits to how much noneconomic diversification market forces will bear, China is at least in part playing “bad cop” with its coercive measures, pushing firms and U.S. allies to diversify without the U.S. government having to expend political and diplomatic capital. Further, as this report assesses, China’s economic coercion has a mixed record of achieving its tactical aims; even when successful tactically, it often harms China’s strategic interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic coercion, then, works both for and against U.S. interests. All else equal, Beijing’s bullying might enhance the image of the United States vis-à-vis China. However, China’s coercion is costly for targeted firms and sectors, and its use can deter allies and partners in ways that violate U.S. interests. In addition, while China’s economic coercion may create the perception that China is an unreliable economic partner, such behavior has not been sufficient to spur the level of supply chain adjustments and sensitive technology export limits deemed necessary to protect U.S. national security, in part because China forgoes targeting the critical technologies it needs in its coercive campaigns. Indeed, given the size and importance of China’s market, it is not feasible nor advisable for states to eliminate every economic dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China will remain enmeshed in the international economic order for the foreseeable future. Economic coexistence is necessary. The United States should therefore not tolerate China’s use of economic coercion. Nevertheless, a comprehensive counterstrategy should account for the ways that Chinese coercion can, at times, align with U.S. interests. In short, it should increase the costs for China due to its own self-defeating behavior while mitigating the harm to U.S. allies and partners and international norms and rules. A counterstrategy can achieve this by accomplishing the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reduce the economic and political pressure China’s economic coercion places on U.S. allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the extent possible, accelerate the hardening and decoupling of allies’ and partners’ sectors and supply chains, especially in critical technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Highlight U.S. efforts to assist targeted nations and draw attention to China’s problematic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strategy based on the concept of deterrence by denial is best suited to achieve these objectives and, in doing so, deter future acts of economic coercion by China. Unlike deterrence by punishment, which threatens to inflict penalties, deterrence by denial makes an action infeasible by decreasing its likelihood of success. In the context of countering China’s economic coercion, deterrence by denial has several advantages over deterrence by punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deterrence-by-punishment-versus-deterrence-by-denial&quot;&gt;Deterrence by Punishment versus Deterrence by Denial&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence is most often associated with punishment. That is to say, if to deter is “to prevent from action by fear of consequences,” the consequences to be feared, under a deterrence-by-punishment framework, are cultivated through threat of punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War doctrine of mutually assured destruction is the paradigmatic example of deterrence by punishment. Nuclear war between the United States and Soviet Union was avoided by the recognition that an attack on one would prompt a retaliatory strike by the other, making a first strike in neither’s interest. Although some have argued a similar logic of punishment should be applied to deter China’s economic coercion, attempting to counter China’s economic coercion by threatening retaliation in kind would face several challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PUNISHMENT AND THE WILLINGNESS DILEMMA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credibility is the foundation of any deterrence policy. For a threat to be credible, the sender must both be willing and able to carry it out. In the context of retaliating against China for its use of economic coercion, the United States, the world’s largest economy, with the deepest capital markets and most innovative technology sector, undoubtedly can inflict significant pain on China through the use of economic measures. The Trump administration’s trade war and the Biden administration’s export controls on semiconductors clearly demonstrate this ability. The issue, then, is not capability but willingness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of China’s economic coercion, signaling willingness to carry out threats is made more difficult by China directing its coercive measures at U.S. allies and partners rather than at the United States itself. It is one thing to threaten retaliation to a direct attack on the homeland; it is another to do so on behalf of a third party, especially when retaliation carries direct domestic costs while the attack on the third party does not. This is especially true in instances of Chinese economic coercion where U.S. firms and producers stand to benefit commercially from an ally’s misfortune. In the deterrence literature, expanding deterrence to include allies and partners is known as “extended deterrence” as opposed to “primary deterrence,” which aims only to deter threats on the homeland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Thomas Schelling, “the difference between the national homeland and everything ‘abroad’ is the difference between threats that are inherently credible, even if unspoken, and the threats that have to be made credible.” French general Charles de Gaulle captured the essence of this willingness dilemma in the context of extended deterrence when he asked U.S. president John F. Kennedy if the United States would, in the context of nuclear war, be willing to “trade New York for Paris.” Thankfully, the stakes are much lower in the economic domain than in the nuclear one. In the case of economic coercion, an analogous exchange might be between wines — Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon for Australian Shiraz — instead of cities. However, the comparatively low stakes complicate willingness and thus credibility in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A military attack on a treaty ally, or even a friendly non-ally, may have the effect of rallying the American people, making them willing to bear costs even if the United States is not threatened or attacked itself and thereby making a threat of retaliation on behalf of an ally a credible threat. The response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a recent, if imperfect, example. At the same time, given the high stakes involved in the military — and especially the nuclear — domain, even if a threat does not seem rational, it still may have a deterrent effect. If the odds were only one in 100 that the United States would have traded New York for Paris, would the Soviet Union still have wanted to wager all of Moscow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of economic coercion, China could probe the credibility of U.S. economic threats without fear of major consequences. Losing access to U.S.-sourced Napa cabernet seems a small price to pay when defending a core interest, while commercial harm to Australian Shiraz sellers seems unlikely to rouse the sympathies of the American people. Moving up the escalation ladder also does not necessarily represent a solution for the United States. Threats are more credible when they are proportional. If the threat is too extreme relative to the behavior being deterred, the target will dismiss it as unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed, though China’s coercive economic policies may be costly at the sectoral level, they rarely, if ever, have a significant macroeconomic impact on the targeted country. Therefore, if the United States were to threaten retaliation with policies that had a macroeconomic impact on China, it would represent an escalatory response, one that would carry significant economic costs and political risks for the United States due to the size and centrality of China’s economy. This strains the credibility of such a threat, especially when U.S. firms are not in Beijing’s crosshairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the threat of retaliation were limited to a proportional response, it is still unclear if the United States would be willing to follow through. The punitive economic measures the United States has implemented against China during the trade and technology war have been justified on the grounds of direct threats to U.S. national and economic security. Would these policies, which carry economic, diplomatic, and political costs, be accepted on the grounds that, for example, Norwegian salmon farmers need U.S. protection?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the United States follows through with similar policies in response to China’s economic coercion, it is unclear if this would alter Beijing’s behavior. Given that China has not abandoned its industrial policies in the face of U.S. tariffs and export controls, is it reasonable to assume China would acquiesce to perceived challenges to core interests? On the contrary, retaliation may actually help Beijing legitimize its coercion, which is often justified to the Chinese people in nationalistic terms, enhancing the resilience of its policies and maybe even their deterrent effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In threatening to retaliate, then, the United States faces a catch-22. If it responds proportionally, the additional cost incurred by China is unlikely to alter Beijing’s calculus. But if it threatens an escalatory response, it becomes more difficult to credibly signal willingness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The informal nature of China’s economic coercion poses another challenge to the credibility of a U.S. threat of retaliation. One strategy for demonstrating commitment to a threat is to ensure the adversary has the “last clear chance” to change their mind. This is often conceptualized as an army burning the bridge behind it to demonstrate it cannot retreat and to force its opponent to decide whether or not to attack. Through the Cold War to today, the United States has signaled its commitment to retaliate in response to an attack on an ally by stationing troops in allied countries where they would be in harm’s way in the event of an attack, making it more likely the United States would respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In masking its economic coercion through the use of informal measures, China is in effect ensuring the United States has the last clear chance to avert confrontation, giving Beijing an advantage in instances of informal economic coercion. Because it is nearly impossible to come up with a definition that clearly captures China’s economic coercion, the United States can always back out of its commitment to retaliate by simply agreeing with China’s assertion that economic coercion is not taking place. In addition, if a definition of economic coercion were put forward to bind the United States to a response, Beijing could simply find ways to engage in coercion without violating the letter of the law. It is therefore unclear how the United States could metaphorically burn the bridge. Private firms, unlike soldiers, cannot be positioned where coercion is likely to occur. Even if they could, it is unclear if they would even be a target, let alone trigger a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, identifying China’s economic coercion in practice will always involve some discretion, an element of “you know it when you see it.” This discretion is necessary to give policymakers flexibility in their response, but in that discretion, there is also always a path for retreat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COALITIONS AND THEIR DISCONTENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempting to build a coalition to retaliate faces its own set of challenges, not least of which is again the difficulty of establishing credibility. Every country in a hypothetical anti-coercion coalition would face its own willingness dilemma, making achieving consensus on retaliation more difficult than if the United States acted alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, if a targeted member country could simply trigger a coalition response, akin to NATO’s Article 5 provision, a moral hazard is created. Members that are relatively unexposed to China’s market may be incentivized to take unnecessarily provocative positions vis-à-vis China at the expense of members that are deeply economically intertwined with China, thereby exposing them to substantial risk in a retaliation scenario. Indeed, creation of a moral hazard has emerged as a primary concern among some member states as the European Union moves to implement its anti-coercion instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of a moral hazard also highlights another related potential problem with a retaliation-oriented coalitional approach: uneven costs and leverage. Not only are countries varied in their dependence on China’s market, but China is also varied in its dependence on different countries for different items. So not only are some countries at greater risk of China’s retaliation, but there are also countries that could be called upon to incur greater costs to punish China than others. Australian iron ore, for example, has been identified as a Chinese vulnerability that an anti-coercion coalition could exploit. China imports around 60 percent of its iron ore from Australia. In its coercive campaign against Canberra, Beijing did not target iron ore due to the prospective domestic economic cost. However, Australia also did not cut off iron ore exports to punish China, as that would likewise carry significant domestic costs for Canberra. Nor did Australia need to take this step: Canberra has not acquiesced to Beijing’s coercion, and China is now even beginning to make diplomatic overtures as tensions enter their sixth year. If Canberra is unwilling to cut off iron ore exports to China when directly targeted by Beijing, why would Australia be willing to do so when a third country is being coerced?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credibility challenges aside, it is not clear that U.S. allies and partners would be interested in joining a coalition with a mission of retaliating against China. As competition between the United States and China has intensified, U.S. allies and partners have resisted choosing between Washington and Beijing. The new multilateral economic groupings and frameworks established by the Biden administration, such as the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), have largely reflected this reality, with the White House refraining from explicitly linking their establishment to concerns about a more confrontational China. Even the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was presented as the economic component of the Obama administration’s broader pivot to Asia, kept the door open for Chinese membership should Beijing meet the agreement’s high standards. In addition, when deciding whether to join such an arrangement, countries would face a window of vulnerability during which China might try to coerce them. The formation of a retaliatory coalition would also play into PRC talking points about U.S. efforts to contain China and undermine its legitimate interests, again legitimizing Beijing’s coercive tactics. All of these factors may make third countries less than willing to join a U.S.-led coalition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the higher-level question of whether deterrence by punishment is the policy path that coerced countries themselves prefer. When facing China’s economic coercion, officials from coerced countries generally have expressed a preference for de-escalation and have speculated that U.S.-led retaliation could lead to escalation by Beijing — escalation that likely would not be directed at the United States but again at smaller U.S. allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE CASE FOR DETERRENCE BY DENIAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence by denial offers an alternative better suited to countering China’s use of economic coercion than deterrence by punishment. It not only is more credible and conducive to coalition building but also provides the United States with a superior diplomatic message. It faces fewer operationalization barriers and allows the United States and allies to capitalize on the self-defeating aspect of China’s behavior in a way that a deterrence strategy based on the logic of punishment fails to account for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence by denial aims to prevent an adversary from taking an unwanted action not through fear of punishment but rather through fear of failure. Importantly, especially in the context of countering China’s economic coercion, deterrence by denial shifts the onus of action from the defender onto the attacker, making it easier for the deterrer to signal willingness. It is the adversary that now has the last clear chance to avoid confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where retaliation is by definition taken after the fact, policies aimed at denying China success in its economic coercion can be implemented preemptively. Examples of such policies might include supply chain resiliency initiatives, identification and reduction of asymmetric dependencies in the terms of trade (to the extent possible), and deeper economic integration with allies and partners through the negotiation of free trade agreements to reduce the relative importance of China’s market. None of these measures need wait for an instance of Chinese economic coercion to be implemented, and no formal definition of Chinese economic coercion need be agreed on beforehand, depriving China of one of the primary advantages of the informality of its coercive measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For deterrence, both by denial and by punishment, to be most effective, the deterrer must clearly communicate its threats or, in the case of denial, its defensive measures. Telegraphing defensive steps, or possible punishments, allows the adversary to update their cost-benefit assessment of the action the defender is seeking to deter. In the military domain, if you want to deter an adversary from launching a missile strike, the adversary needs to know that you have a missile defense system before it attacks in order to update their assessment of the likelihood of success. Applying the analogy to the economic domain, knowing that a state is taking steps to reduce the likelihood of economic coercion being successful allows China the opportunity to update its cost and benefit analysis before implementing coercive measures rather than after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deterrence-by-denial strategy has the added benefit of turning what would be a weakness in a deterrence-by-punishment strategy into a strength. It is impossible to guard against every vector of attack. This is especially true in the case of China’s economic coercion. Given the size and importance of China’s market, it is neither advisable nor possible for states to completely decouple economically. Therefore, China will always have some levers that it can pull in an attempt to influence target states’ politics and policies. It should be expected, then, that China will probe for weaknesses in any economic defenses that are constructed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under a deterrence-by-punishment framework, failure to respond to Chinese provocation with retaliation would erode U.S. credibility and thus the deterrent effect of the framework. However, under a deterrence-by-denial framework, China can still attempt to coerce a target, but so long as the targeted country does not back down, the framework’s deterrent effect is not weakened but instead may be strengthened. Over time, a series of successes where China coerces and the target does not acquiesce can further enhance the deterrent effect as Beijing comes to see the futility of its actions. This is a phenomenon referred to in the literature as cumulative deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit afforded by the deterrence-by-denial approach is that even were it to fail in the sense that Beijing was undeterred, it would still mitigate the impact of China’s coercion on the targeted country. In doing so, not only would the costs to China increase, but it would also represent an opportunity for the United States to publicly shame or criticize China for its behavior, a tactic which has been shown effective in the criminology and counterterrorism contexts, where deterrence by denial has had an influential role in policy development. In addition, the more Beijing attempts to coerce, the more other potential targets should come to recognize the risks of economic dependence on China and the more willing they should become to work with the United States preemptively to adopt defensive strategies, reducing the effectiveness of future Chinese coercive actions and advancing U.S. efforts to decouple its allies from the Chinese economy in certain sensitive sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a deterrence-by-denial strategy has distinct advantages for multilateralizing a response to China’s economic coercion. Because it does not involve retaliating directly at China, states should be more willing to coordinate their policies, in part evidenced by the interest among allies and partners in U.S.-led supply chain resiliency initiatives, such as those in the TTC and the IPEF. Moreover, unlike in a deterrence-by-punishment strategy, states are not necessarily asked to take an action to help a third country but to take steps that are in their own direct self-interest, such as making their economies more resilient against external shocks. Indeed, Japan and South Korea, both previous targets of China’s economic coercion, have undertaken policy initiatives aimed at better insulating their economies from Chinese manipulation via China exit subsidies and the New Southern Policy, respectively. As mentioned, allies and partners do not need to agree on a definition of China’s economic coercion to coordinate on resiliency initiatives. Instead, all that is needed is mutual recognition that the problem exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-4-when-is-extended-deterrence-by-punishment-warranted&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 4. When Is Extended Deterrence by Punishment Warranted?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Should the United States ever pursue deterrence by punishment to counter Beijing’s economic coercion of a U.S. ally? A strategy of extended deterrence by punishment faces more acute credibility challenges and could lead to unwanted escalation. It also engenders greater difficulties mobilizing political support both at home and multilaterally. Still, it is worth exploring whether certain outlier cases might exist — short of a direct conflict between the United States and China — in which Chinese economic coercion may warrant either an ex ante U.S. threat of retaliation or ex post U.S. punishment response.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s economic coercion could credibly be met with a U.S. threat of retaliation in a scenario where the measures implemented against a U.S. ally are so severe that they cause serious macroeconomic damage. In such a scenario, U.S. interests would be significantly challenged, and the threat of a response that would inflict significant costs on China becomes proportional to Beijing’s actions. Further, other countries may be in favor of or in line with a retaliatory response given the scale of the damage.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;However, China’s economic coercion has never risen to such a level of macroeconomic damage despite arguably having opportunities in the cases of Japan and Australia. In the Japan case, China lifted its rare earths export ban before imposing severe costs to the Japanese economy. In Australia’s case, China did not target iron ore due to the domestic costs. Likewise, China opted not to take more severe measures against South Korea when it failed to target trade in “intermediary goods in the IT sector,” which also would have incurred domestic costs for China. This is consistent with Beijing’s observed pattern of minimizing costs to its own economy in its implementation of coercive economic measures.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chinese military writings provide some insight into the conditions under which China’s economic coercion might rise to a destructive threshold despite high domestic costs. The PLA’s Course Book on the Taiwan Strait’s Military Geography envisions a seizure of Taiwan enabling blockades of Japan. Military planners speculate, “If we can reduce Japan’s raw imports by 15–20 percent, it will be a heavy blow to Japan’s economy.” Moreover, a reduction in imports by 50 percent “can even create a famine within the Japanese islands.” Obviously, the United States would want to deter a Chinese-imposed famine on the Japanese islands, and the destruction of Japan’s “economic activity and war-making potential” would represent a direct challenge to U.S. strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;However, this hypothetical scenario also reveals that to inflict such severe economic damage, China must not only use military means against a U.S. treaty ally but also occupy Taiwan. The former already carries a direct threat of U.S. retaliation, while in the latter case the United States has increasingly signaled it would intervene with economic sanctions, if not militarily. In short, the severe macroeconomic damage that would make a U.S. threat of economic retaliation credible already crosses U.S. red lines and likely also crosses into the military domain — putting it outside the scope of the cases of economic coercion that this report seeks to address.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is harder to imagine scenarios short of war where China would inflict such severe economic damage, as China has proven itself averse to incurring costs from economic coercion. However, China’s central position within the structure of international trade — especially its growing market power over areas such as critical minerals, mature-node semiconductors, and global shipping and logistics — gives Beijing economic leverage over U.S. allies that the CCP is actively seeking to enhance. The CCP’s industrial policy goals, as best encapsulated in Xi Jinping’s aspiration to “create an enormous gravitational force for international commodities and key resources,” appear to envision a future in which China’s ever-greater economic centrality translates to a concomitant rise in its geopolitical influence. At the same time, Beijing is seeking to limit its vulnerability to external economic shocks. If successful, China may be more willing and able to inflict greater economic costs on states it perceives to have challenged its interests. That said, given the limited economic impact of China’s economic coercion observed so far, an escalation by Beijing does not necessarily translate into significant economic damage for a targeted country.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Another scenario where the United States might credibly threaten retaliation is one where a targeted ally requests the United States respond to China’s economic coercion with punitive measures. There is likely significant overlap between this scenario and a scenario where China’s economic coercion causes severe damage to an ally’s economy. In no cases surveyed in this report did an ally appear to request the United States retaliate against China on its behalf, nor did any try to retaliate against China themselves. On the contrary, targeted countries seemed to prefer de-escalation as a response. In some cases, former officials expressed a belief that U.S. retaliation would only make the situation worse. However, these officials also indicated they sought greater U.S. support amid these crises and were frustrated when support did not materialize. Any strategy aimed at helping U.S. allies and partners should take into consideration the views of those allies and partners.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operationalizing-a-deterrence-by-denial-strategy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Operationalizing a Deterrence-by-Denial Strategy: Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study proposes a counterstrategy premised on deterrence by denial rather than by punishment. The counterstrategy has two mutually reinforcing components: preemptive actions focused on building partner resilience (denying the coercer targets of opportunity), and reactive steps focused on providing relief to victims once coercion has occurred (deflecting the coercer’s intent). Together these components work to mitigate and over time deter China’s economic coercion. The counterstrategy considers the characteristics of and motivations behind China’s economic coercion. It acknowledges that China’s economic coercion is problematic but also recognizes that China’s coercion is not an insurmountable challenge and has a poor track record of success. It focuses on building resilience and providing relief to affected firms and nations instead of directly punishing China and in doing so mitigates costs to potential target countries while maximizing reputational and economic costs for Beijing. Over time, the aim of the strategy is to demonstrate to China the futility of its coercive actions, prompting Beijing to abandon its disruptive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PREEMPTIVE DENIAL POLICIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first pillar of the counterstrategy is preemptive denial. It involves implementing defensive resiliency measures to reduce partners’ vulnerability to Beijing’s prospective coercion. Acknowledging it is impossible to completely eliminate all vulnerabilities, countries can nevertheless seek to diversify markets and supply chains and proactively identify potential alternative markets should China attempt to disrupt normal commercial relations. These efforts would raise the cost of economic coercion for China while decreasing its likelihood of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific policies and tools of denial include the following, which should be put in place before any Chinese coercion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Establish an interagency “CoerCom.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is organizational. To pool knowledge and resources, coordinate, and centralize U.S. counter-coercion strategies and initiatives, the U.S. government should establish a new interagency committee: the Committee on Countering China’s Economic Coercion, or “CoerCom.” The committee would resemble the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) in structure. It would comprise cabinet members and directors from relevant departments and agencies such as the Departments of State, Treasury, and Commerce; units of the Executive Office of the President, including the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Office of Management and Budget, Council of Economic Advisers, National Security Council, and National Economic Council; and relevant governmental and quasi-governmental agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, and Export-Import Bank of the United States. CoerCom would make recommendations to the president on the policies and tools of denial discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Build a coercion-denial coalition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should take the initiative by unilaterally setting up its own counter-coercion policies. However, Washington should work to encourage the voluntary adoption of similar approaches by Group of Seven (G7) and other advanced industrial countries, with all such strategies focused on denial rather than punishment. As others set up their own counter-coercion programs, relief policies (discussed below) can be coordinated through G7 processes to enhance the quality and amount of relief flowing to a targeted country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next question that arises is to which countries should the United States and other G7 countries extend an “economic security umbrella,” offering them the promise of relief if they were to be economically coerced. In deterrence theory, there is often a tension between inclusivity and credibility. China may not find it credible that the United States would be willing to aid states with whom the United States does not have a strong strategic interest at stake. If the United States makes a commitment and then does not follow through, it raises questions about whether aid will be forthcoming if another country finds itself in Beijing’s crosshairs. If states lose trust in the U.S. commitment, then the deterrent effect of China’s economic coercion remains intact, as states will hesitate to challenge China for fear of retribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To maintain credibility, an explicit commitment might be limited to a subset of close treaty allies. It could be expanded out from there to include other allies and strategic partners, then perhaps to countries with which the United States has trade agreements. However, as policymakers decide to delineate U.S. commitments, the basic trade-off between inclusivity, on one side, and costs and credibility, on the other, should be kept in mind. Where the United States does not explicitly commit to providing relief to all countries, it could signal that in special cases where the coercion of a state outside the explicit “economic security umbrella” could still be eligible for relief should an interest of the United States be challenged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Review vulnerabilities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments and firms in countries at risk of coercion should conduct economy-wide reviews to identify potentially vulnerable industries and sectors. Vulnerable industries and sectors can be in part identified by considering patterns of China’s coercive behavior identified in the case studies. Such sectors include those in which China has an asymmetric advantage, has a strategic interest or domestic competitors or interest groups that benefit from protectionism, can readily find substitutes, and will not incur high costs, as well as sectors that are politically important in the targeted country. Table 6 offers a possible framework for assessing a given sector’s vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Fiz1Kw2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image7&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EnbTLB3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 6. Assessing a Sector’s Vulnerability to Chinese Economic Coercion.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can aid allies and partners by providing technical assistance with their vulnerability reviews. CoerCom can provide subject matter experts and coordinate efforts among partners. In addition to identifying vulnerabilities, potential disruptions can be modeled to help inform mitigation strategies. Preemptively identifying alternative markets should speed adjustments during a coercive campaign, reducing costs. Although China has rarely made use of export restrictions, it may look to do so in the future. Therefore, limited stockpiling of critical components by vulnerable firms may be advisable to limit disruption to operations and allow time to identify new suppliers. Much of the knowledge about the structure of supply chains rests in the private sector, so governments should provide incentives and share information so firms can undertake many of these mitigation strategies themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Reinforce supply chain resiliency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flurry of supply chain resiliency initiatives that were launched amid the supply chain disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and then accelerated by the war in Ukraine provide a model and a platform for states guarding against China’s economic coercion. China exercises its coercive economic leverage largely through other states’ dependencies on its market. Therefore, supply chain resiliency initiatives should factor vulnerability to Chinese economic coercion into their assessments when seeking to build resilient supply chains. Efforts to build supply chains less vulnerable to China’s economic coercion can be embedded in recently created and ongoing multilateral initiatives such as the TTC and the IPEF, both of which have dedicated supply chain resiliency components. In fact, the TTC has already explicitly stated its members seek to “build resilience to economic coercion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separate supply chain resiliency initiatives could be established to address China’s coercion, but there is a benefit of couching counter-coercion initiatives within broader ongoing supply chain resilience initiatives. Such positioning provides states with some diplomatic cover, making it less likely China will attempt to deter their participation. That said, it is important that China’s economic coercion receive dedicated attention as China tends to target items that ongoing supply chain resiliency initiatives may not cover. For example, there has been significant attention placed on securing semiconductor supply chains, but China has proven reluctant to target high-technology goods in its coercive campaigns, as doing so would harm its own economic development. Instead, China has shown a preference for targeting substitutable commodities and consumer goods that may not receive attention in a narrowly scoped supply chain resiliency context, which tends to focus on goods critical to national security and emergency preparedness. Likewise, ongoing supply chain resiliency initiatives that emerged after the Covid-19 pandemic also primarily focus on possible disruption of access to critical goods and inputs, whereas China, except for in the cases of Japan and Lithuania, prefers to block imports rather than restrict exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with government incentives, it can take years and be very costly for firms to diversify their supply chains. Japan’s diversification of its rare earth supply chain away from China following the Senkakus fishing boat incident is emblematic. In what may be the most ambitious supply chain relocation effort to date, Japan’s move required tens of billions of yen of state investment and a high level of state capacity and intervention in the market. After nine years and several setbacks, Japan has made a sizable dent in its dependency on China for rare earths. In 2020 Japan relied on China for 58 percent of its rare earths, down from 85 percent in 2009. Tokyo aims to further reduce that reliance to below 50 percent by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s efforts draw attention to the difficulty and costs of achieving even moderate levels of resilience and diversification. Japan’s case is also unique for a couple of important reasons. China’s export restriction on rare earths represented a severe threat to Japan’s economy. It therefore made economic and strategic sense for Japan to devote a large amount of resources to develop alternative sources. In most cases, however, China’s economic coercion has not proven extremely costly for the targeted country. Therefore, states considering diversifying their supply chains away from China to mitigate risk of economic coercion by Beijing need to ensure the cure is not worse than the disease. In some cases, the cost of diversification could be greater than the economic pain China is willing or able to inflict via economic coercion. In those cases, it is likely better to be prepared to provide relief to affected firms and sectors after coercion begins (the second component of this strategy, discussed below) than devote significant resources to preemptively diversify supply chains that may or may not be targeted in the future and, if targeted, likely would not significantly harm the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan also benefited from unique state institutions, such as the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and especially the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC), which led and managed Japan’s diversification operations. Other states may lack the capacity to replicate such an ambitious endeavor. Moreover, a broader shift to managed trade is not one that should be undertaken lightly. Japan’s dependency on China for rare earths represents a critical vulnerability. There may be other critical vulnerabilities that likewise require large initiatives to diversify. But these efforts should be narrowly targeted. In seeking to counter China’s coercion, it is important not to violate the very norms and rules of international commerce that the counter strategy is seeking to protect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Negotiate free trade agreements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can help strengthen resilience to China’s economic coercion by negotiating trade agreements that offer meaningful market access to signatories. Opening U.S. markets to allies and partners can help reduce dependence on China’s market and speed market adjustments in cases of coercion. Trade negotiations also present an opportunity for allies and partners to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities to China’s economic coercion. In addition, trade agreements offer the opportunity to proactively implement coercion-specific measures. Creative policy solutions might include temporary and additional tariff reduction by signatories on certain goods targeted by China if a signatory finds itself a victim of Chinese economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current unwillingness of the United States to negotiate free trade agreements cedes the economic arena to China, which through its own trade efforts is seeking to shape the international economic environment to one that increases foreign countries’ investment in China while insulating the Chinese economy from exogenous shocks — potentially enhancing its ability to carry out economic coercion campaigns against U.S. allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. Establish a U.S. anti-coercion instrument (USACI).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the European Union’s proposed ACI would empower the European Commission to put together a portfolio of proportional retaliatory policies in response to an instance of economic coercion, the United States should establish its own anti-coercion instrument. However, instead of being comprised of punishment-oriented tools, the USACI should be comprised of new and existing relief-oriented tools collapsed into a single instrument that can be tailored to respond to the unique circumstances of each specific incidence of Chinese economic coercion. This will provide the United States with the flexibility necessary to respond to China’s economic coercion. Specifically, the USACI should be comprised of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a. A new coercion compensation fund&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should create and fund a coercion compensation fund. When a case of economic coercion is identified and relief authorized by the president, the funds would be transferred to the targeted country to be distributed to affected industries and firms. CoerCom would recommend how much funding should be released and oversee the distribution of the funds by the targeted government. The funds are not intended to offset the entire cost of China’s coercion, but instead to provide some compensation to help cover the costs of finding new markets or suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not expected that this fund would need to be very large to be effective. For example, the two investment support packages that the Canadian government offered its agriculture producers in July 2019 totaled C$19 million, and given that Canada never relented to Chinese pressure, this amount of support proved sufficient. The Canadian case also demonstrates that this fund would not be the only relief flowing to affected firms and producers. Instead, U.S. relief would complement relief provided by the targeted country to its domestic industry (see below). In addition, as new markets are found, the need for funding would decrease over time. That said, more research is needed to provide an estimate of the appropriate size of a coercion compensation fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b. Existing relief tools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States already has numerous tools at its disposal that could be used to aid a targeted country. Preemptively identifying these tools and providing the authority to deploy them in cases of coercion would allow the United States to quickly provide more economic relief to the targeted country. Apart from providing relief, these tools can also help speed market adjustments, further undermining the effectiveness of China’s economic coercion. Their use has the added benefit of raising costs, both economic and reputational, for Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, CoerCom would be responsible for recommending which tools to use depending on the specifics of the ongoing case of coercion and the needs of the targeted country. A sample of some existing policy tools that could be deployed includes but is not limited to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM) products: The EXIM has several financing tools at its disposal to promote U.S. exports. These include working capital loan guarantees, loan guarantees for foreign buyers of U.S. exports, and export credit insurance for U.S. exporters. Eligibility for these tools could be expanded to include a targeted country’s buyers of U.S. exports and U.S. exporters seeking to increase their presence in or enter the market of a targeted country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sovereign loan guarantees: The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 provides the President the authority to provide sovereign loan guarantees, under which the United States guarantees the repayment of loans made to a foreign government. This allows the foreign government cheaper and easier access to international capital, which, in the case of coercion, the targeted country could use to aid affected firms and producers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tariff reductions: Under the U.S. Constitution, authority to adjust tariff rates is vested in Congress. However, Congress often cedes that power to the president to negotiate trade agreements through Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). Likewise, authority could be granted to the president to temporarily reduce tariffs on goods from a targeted country that are facing import restrictions in China. Eligibility for goods could be based on eligibility under Generalized System of Preferences as proposed under the recently introduced Countering Economic Coercion Act of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Political risk insurance: The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) currently provides coverage of up to $1 billion against losses resulting from political risk. This authority could be expanded to provide political risk insurance coverage to U.S. and foreign investors investing in sectors and firms in targeted countries that have been adversely affected by China’s economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legal services funding: The Department of State maintains the Transaction Advisory Fund, which provides funding to government agencies in eligible Indo-Pacific countries for legal advisory services in support of infrastructure projects. Funding under this program could be authorized to be made available in cases where China violates the terms of a contract to economically coerce a targeted country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deployment of these tools would be case dependent. For example, if China restricted the export of a key commodity or good, it would be appropriate to make use of EXIM tools to encourage U.S. exporters of the same or substitutable products to backfill demand. At the same time, under that scenario, it would not make sense to lower U.S. tariffs on goods exported from the targeted country. Instead, the use of tariff reductions would be appropriate in instances where China restricts its imports from a targeted country. In practice, import restrictions are China’s preferred coercive tools, and by reducing U.S. tariffs on those targeted goods, market adjustments can be accelerated, limiting the impact of China’s coercion on the targeted country’s exporters. Sovereign loan guarantees and political risk insurance could hypothetically be employed in either cases of import or export restrictions. Both would also be applicable if China were to restrict financing to the targeted country, as was threatened in the case of Mongolia with Beijing’s cancelation of negotiations surrounding Chinese loans and funding for infrastructure projects. In such a scenario, the United States could also release legal services funding to help affected countries negotiate or address violations of contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7. Encourage partners to develop their own authorities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries vulnerable to economic coercion should preemptively expand the authority of relevant domestic agencies to provide relief to sectors and firms affected when coercion occurs. As mentioned, Canada leveraged existing authorities to provide its agriculture industry with investment support packages to cover costs of finding alternative markets, and the European Union offered financing for affected Lithuanian firms. Identifying such tools ahead of time would allow targeted states to respond even faster. Where authorities to provide such relief do not exist, vulnerable countries should preemptively adopt them. Examples might include establishing a program of political risk insurance provided at a discounted rate to vulnerable firms, or concessional loans for affected industries to cover costs until new markets can be found. The latter would have been particularly helpful in the Philippines case, as banana farmers rely on revenue from harvest to buy seeds for the following year’s crop. When China blocked imports, the business cycle was disrupted, not only harming the current harvest but also affecting the producers’ ability to plant the following year. However, an injection of capital to provide farmers the funds to plant the next year’s crop would have limited the disruption caused by China’s action. Again, the United States could offer technical assistance to help partners develop their own relief instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REACTIVE “DEFLECTION” POLICIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the preemptive denial measures described above should reduce China’s incentives to coerce vulnerable countries, coercion is likely to continue to occur. Therefore, a second pillar of a deterrence-by-denial strategy is necessary: providing economic relief and other support to a targeted country or sector once coercion has occurred. By reducing the costs of China’s economic coercion and relieving political pressure on the targeted government, relief measures should make it easier for the targeted country to resist complying, “deflecting” Beijing’s intent. U.S. offers of relief also signal to other countries that if they challenge China, and China retaliates, they will receive support from the United States. This has the added benefit of reinforcing the resiliency-enhancing policies of the first component of this strategy, as reactive relief speeds market adjustments away from China, reducing targeted countries’ vulnerability to China’s economic coercion in the future. It also provides a means of raising the costs of coercion for Beijing, allowing the United States to indirectly punish China for its behavior without the downsides of direct punishment discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommended post-coercion “deflection” policies include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8. Define actionable coercion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To release economic relief to a targeted country, an instance of economic coercion must first be identified. This is easier said than done. While the academic definition of economic coercion is straightforward, China cloaks its economic coercion in informality, pointing to alternative explanations for the decline in commercial activity such as sanitary and phytosanitary violations. This makes it difficult to set out a strict definition of economic coercion that would implicate China’s behavior. As soon as a definition is set, China could find ways to coerce around it. Instead, to paraphrase Supreme Court justice Potter Stewart in Jacobellis v. Ohio, there will always be an element of “you know it when you see it” when seeking to define China’s economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the definitional challenges posed by China’s economic coercion, the U.S. president should have the discretion to declare an instance of economic coercion. The process could look something like this: The targeted state would request U.S. assistance in countering China’s economic coercion. CoerCom would then have a short timeline to investigate and submit a recommendation to the president, much as CFIUS does when making a recommendation to the president on a foreign investment in the United States. The recommendation would then inform the president’s decision as to whether coercion is occurring. Congress would have the opportunity to overturn the president’s decision through an up-or-down vote. Moreover, if relief is provided, Congress would have the ability to halt aid at any time through an up-or-down vote. This would ensure congressional oversight and help secure domestic political support for the relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9. Deploy the USACI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once an incidence of Chinese economic coercion has been positively identified, CoerCom would provide the president with the specific set of relief policies authorized under the USACI (see recommendation 6 above) that the United States can implement to help an ally. The size, composition, and the duration of the aid package would be case-dependent, allowing the United States to tailor its response to the severity and diversity of measures that China employs in its coercive campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relief provided to the targeted country does not need to offset the total cost of China’s economic coercion — nor should it, as this might create a moral hazard where the risks of doing business with China are not fully factored into firm-level and state-level decision making. Instead, the goal of relief is to ensure that political pressure from affected sectors and firms on the targeted government is reduced to a level that the targeted government does not acquiesce to China’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond immediate relief, CoerCom should be tasked with identifying possible opportunities to incentivize and speed decoupling of the targeted country from China in critical technology and other strategic sectors. Although Beijing has avoided targeting high-tech firms, it blocked the import of certain advanced lasers needed for both materials and biotech research as well as advanced manufacturing when it placed a de facto embargo on Lithuania. During the dispute with South Korea over the deployment of THAAD, it was reported that the South Korean government asked Samsung to reconsider its $7 billion investment to build a second memory fabrication facility in Xi’an. However, Samsung went ahead with the investment, and today Samsung’s operations in Xi’an account for 15.3 percent of the global output of NAND flash memory products. This seems like a missed opportunity to reduce dependency on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Lithuania case, Taiwan responded by setting up a $200 million investment fund as well as $1 billion in credit to incentivize joint ventures between Lithuanian and Taiwanese firms, mainly focusing on synergies between Lithuania’s laser industry and Taiwan’s semiconductor industry. The United States could consider setting up an additional dedicated fund to incentivize either joint ventures with U.S. firms or investment in the United States by foreign technology firms targeted by China’s economic coercion. The funding might also be attached to restrictions on future investment in China similar to the restrictions included in the CHIPS Act. In cases where a high-tech firm is not directly targeted, such as in South Korea, there is still an opportunity for the United States to advocate for the redirection of pending investments and publicize the risks of doing business with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging China’s economic coercion to speed decoupling in critical and emerging technologies has the additional advantage of imposing costs on China that Beijing has proven sensitive to, adding an element of retaliation to an otherwise relief-oriented counterstrategy. It also spares the United States from playing bad cop, expending diplomatic capital to convince reluctant allies to decouple from China in certain sensitive sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;10. Support WTO cases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever possible, the United States should encourage the targeted state to bring a case against China to the WTO. Then the United States and other G7 members should sign on as third parties, which is allowed under WTO rules even in cases where the third parties’ economic interests are not directly challenged, if the case represents a broader challenge to the integrity of the global trading system. For example, both Australia and Canada brought cases to the WTO in response to China’s coercive economic actions. China’s informal approach and the WTO’s broken appeals process mean that such legal cases are not an effective response to China’s economic coercion by themselves, especially because speed is an essential element of an effective sanctions-busting strategy. However, filing cases, in conjunction with the other steps recommended here, is a low-cost way to signal multilateral support for both the targeted country and international norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;11. Enhance diplomatic messaging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For deterrence by denial to be most effective, the coercer needs to be aware of the upgraded defenses of its targets so that its cost-benefit calculation can be updated. Therefore, the United States and other G7 advanced economies should make statements about, and otherwise publicize, their efforts to build resilience against China’s economic coercion. This messaging campaign need not be limited to the G7, but smaller more vulnerable states also need not be pressured to make statements that could be construed as taking a position against China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deflection policies should be accompanied by a robust diplomatic messaging campaign with three priorities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a. Deflecting the psychological impact of China’s economic coercion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic coercion has not imposed significant macroeconomic costs on targeted countries. However, the psychological impact can be large, potentially causing targets to acquiesce to Beijing’s demands when a more cool-headed analysis of the coercive measures’ effects would have reassured policymakers of their ability to absorb the costs. Beginning even before China threatens vulnerable/protected states and continuing throughout China’s coercive campaign, the United States should message its intention to provide, and highlight its provision of, aid and assistance to targeted countries. In doing so, it can erode the concern China’s coercion inspires in vulnerable countries, strengthening the resolve of the targeted state and weakening the deterrent effect of the threat of China’s economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b. Shaming China by drawing attention to its problematic behavior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing relief instead of retaliating affords the United States the diplomatic moral high ground. The United States should take advantage of this opportunity to draw attention to China’s problematic behavior and juxtapose it with U.S. efforts to provide economic relief to targeted countries. In theory, this should increase the reputational costs China incurs from its use of economic coercion and accelerate Beijing’s already declining image around the world. At the same time, drawing attention to China’s arbitrary and capricious actions may encourage firms to reconsider dependencies on China’s market, aiding diversification efforts. If, by contrast, the United States were to pursue retaliation against China, it would surrender the moral high ground and potentially help the PRC legitimize its coercive actions domestically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;c. Highlighting the ineffectiveness of China’s coercion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s coercion is already frequently ineffective. Providing relief will make it even less effective. Drawing attention to this should enhance deterrence by denial by both demonstrating to vulnerable countries they have little to fear from China and signaling to China that its policies do not achieve their intended effect and instead, in some cases, work against Beijing’s own interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF AN EFFECTIVE DETERRENCE-BY-DENIAL STRATEGY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intertwining Components&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denial policies can encourage states to adopt their own deflection policies, decreasing the burden on the United States and enhancing the sanctions-busting power of the counterstrategy. Supply chain resilience initiatives and free trade agreements, in particular, provide useful platforms. For example, trade agreements could include commitments by signatories to establish their own coercion compensation funds with clear processes for when and how they are deployed. Signatories might also commit to preemptively authorizing relative agencies and departments to provide concessional loans, export credit, political risk insurance, and so on to help speed market realignments in instances of coercion. Embedding such policy discussions in the context of a free trade negotiation or a multilateral supply chain resilience initiative has the added benefit of ensuring coordination and allowing for dissemination of best practices to prevent abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avoiding Moral Hazard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One theoretical risk to providing relief to firms targeted by China’s economic coercion involves placing firms in positions of moral hazard. Firms may not accurately price the risk of doing business in China because they assume the U.S. government will bail them out if they are coerced. This assumption could encourage firms that would have otherwise had incentive to diversify away from China to remain overly dependent on China’s market, thus preserving China’s economic leverage, which Beijing could translate into future geostrategic influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, states under the U.S. economic security umbrella might also be placed in a position of moral hazard. Again, the expectation of U.S. aid could encourage states to take positions on China that might be popular with domestic political constituencies but are nonetheless overly antagonistic. This could create needless diplomatic tension, constraining U.S. ability to engage with China when needed and expending U.S. resources in an unproductive manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite the theoretical arguments for these moral hazards, it is unlikely that either hazard would emerge under the proposed counterstrategy. The amount of relief provided is not intended to offset the total cost of China’s coercion; it is only meant to help speed market adjustments and decrease the amount of political pressure targeted firms might place on their home governments. It therefore seems unrealistic to expect that firms would not factor in the possible cost to their operations due to China’s propensity to engage in economic coercion. Likewise, the counterstrategy seems unlikely to encourage states to take overly aggressive positions vis-à-vis China for the same reason. The relief provided is not sufficient to remove all risks. Moreover, the processes in place for identifying instances of economic coercion should guard against frivolous claims of economic coercion. Unlike in a punishment-oriented strategy, there is little risk for unnecessary escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domestic Political Support&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any effective counterstrategy should have domestic political support. Without this, the credibility of the U.S. response could be undermined if targeted countries and China believe the United States will not follow through with promised relief due to domestic political opposition. The most likely stakeholders from which domestic political opposition could arise are U.S. firms and producers that stand to benefit from China’s economic coercion of foreign rivals and could be harmed by the proposed U.S. response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A paradox of China’s economic coercion is that while firms in the targeted countries are harmed, rival firms in the United States and in other allied countries can benefit. For example, exports of Californian and French wine to China reportedly increased after China restricted imports of Australian Shiraz. Providing relief to Shiraz producers in Australia then could rouse accusations from domestic producers of subsidizing foreign competitors. Likewise, reducing tariffs on targeted goods could cause domestic competitors to object. However, despite the possibility of some domestic political opposition, there is reason to believe that the counterstrategy would receive broad political support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, countering China has become a point of bipartisan consensus in Washington. Even though some U.S. firms and producers may see their interests undermined by the counterstrategy, their opposition would likely be muted, as members of Congress are loath to look weak on countering China. This dynamic can be seen in the Biden administration’s recent export controls on semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Despite the costs for domestic industry due to loss of access to China’s market, there has been no vocal opposition from Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the counterstrategy is designed to be both narrowly targeted and subject to congressional oversight, which should help ensure strong domestic political support. Again, the strategy is not intended to offset all costs of China’s economic coercion, just to provide sufficient relief to reduce political pressure on the targeted country by helping firms find new markets quickly. The limited nature of the relief should mitigate concerns that domestic industry might have that the U.S. government is subsidizing their foreign competitors. Likewise, the CoerCom review process for coercion claims should guard against free-riding concerns, while congressional oversight throughout the process is designed to ensure domestic constituencies potentially harmed by relief policies have an opportunity to raise concerns through their elected representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, on the denial side of the counterstrategy, there is strong bipartisan support for supply chain resilience initiatives. Although the current protectionist sentiment in Washington has impeded U.S. negotiation of new free trade agreements, most Americans still view free trade as a net positive for the economy. At the same time, with Americans increasingly supportive of efforts to counter China, positioning free trade agreements with allies as a key component of that effort, especially as a counter to malign Chinese economic influence, may represent a path back to a more robust trade policy. Moving forward on the preemptive denial components of the counterstrategy has the added benefit of signaling U.S. commitment, as discussed previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic sanctions literature indicates that sanctions lose their bite over time as new markets and work-arounds are found, political coalitions within the sending state fracture due to rising costs, and views of the coercing state harden within the target state. Therefore, it is imperative that relief reaches the targeted country quickly. This means that even if other G7 members adopt similar counter-coercion policies and commitments to aid targeted countries, the United States should still retain the ability to act unilaterally rather than waiting until consensus is achieved among partners on whether a case of coercion merits a response. After the United States acts, it should encourage allies to follow suit, beginning with G7 members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iterative Action&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be successful, the counterstrategy does not have to deter China as soon as it is unveiled. Instead, its deterrent effect can be strengthened by each instance of China’s economic coercion. Over time, China will come to see the futility and costs of its actions. At the same time, the counterstrategy will signal to allied and partner governments that the United States stands ready to support them. Moreover, each time China coerces, it represents an opportunity for the United States to help a partner country harden its economy to coercion by removing leverage that China might be able to exploit in the future. The two components of the counterstrategy — denial and deflection — effectively reinforce each other this way. Even if complete deterrence is not achieved, the strategy is flexible enough to promote U.S. interests by simply raising the costs and lowering the efficacy of China’s problematic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Credibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credibility is essential to any deterrence policy. As discussed above, in the context of countering China’s economic coercion, a deterrence-by-denial strategy is more credible than a deterrence-by-punishment approach. However, there are still steps that policymakers should take to enhance the credibility of the outlined counterstrategy, especially the reactive deflection component. Specifically, the relief must be released in clear instances of Chinese economic coercion. The counterstrategy’s credibility will be enhanced even more if that relief effectively prevents the targeted country from backing down. If, however, relief is not forthcoming or is ineffective, then China, as well as targeted countries, may come to question U.S. commitment. The result in this case may be that China is not deterred, while third countries self-censor to avoid provoking Beijing. The question of whether the United States will provide relief can be addressed by legislating that the United States must respond, as outlined in this proposed counterstrategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. policymakers should be objective about the threat posed to U.S. interests by China’s economic coercion. A careful examination of cases of China’s economic coercion over the past decade reveals that, while problematic, it has largely been ineffective. It imposes costs on the targeted sectors, but China’s own aversion to costs and risks, combined with the power of markets to adapt, limit Beijing’s ability to impose significant economy-wide costs on the targeted economy. That said, China’s economic coercion provides Beijing with an avenue through which to signal resolve and possibly deter third countries from adopting policy positions that run contrary to the party’s perceived interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even if China’s coercion does achieve some deterrence, it is still not in the interest of the United States to exaggerate the threat posed by China’s behavior. In fact, doing so may paradoxically play into Beijing’s hands. It could enhance the psychological impact of China’s coercion or the threat thereof, making the targeted state more likely to acquiesce and vulnerable states less likely to challenge Beijing. If the United States is tempted to employ tactics similar to China’s in an effort to deter Beijing’s problematic behavior, it may unintentionally legitimize China’s economic coercion while also upsetting allies and partners and further undermining the norms of the international rules-based order that the United States is seeking to protect and uphold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that China’s behavior should be tolerated. On the contrary, it should be deterred — and deterrence by denial, rather than by punishment, provides the United States with the best way to do that. As operationalized above, a counterstrategy centered around deterrence by denial would deter China’s economic coercion over time by raising the costs for China while also demonstrating to Beijing the futility of its actions. It would accomplish this by both proactively hardening states’ economies to China’s economic coercion through a combination of diversification away from China and closer economic integration with the United States (denial) and by setting up mechanisms that would enable the United States to provide financial relief to affected firms in targeted countries, thus speeding up market adjustments (deflection).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deterrence-by-denial approach has several advantages over a deterrence-by-punishment approach. First and foremost, it is much more credible, and without credibility, deterrence fails. It has the benefit of being more easily multilateralized. It allows the United States to maintain the diplomatic high ground while also avoiding the needless and counterproductive risk of escalation between Washington and Beijing. It also factors in the preferences of allies and partners that are targets of China’s economic coercion. Further, deterrence by denial plays to the United States’ comparative advantage, using the power of the market to bust China’s sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, in resisting the temptation to retaliate, the United States remains true to its values, upholding the norms of international commerce that have enabled an era of prosperity. As U.S. diplomat George Kennan states in the final paragraph of his 1946 “long telegram”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Finally, we must have courage and self-confidence to cling to our own methods and conceptions of human society. After all, the greatest danger that can befall us in coping with this problem of Soviet Communism, is that we shall allow ourselves to become like those with whom we are coping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japan-fishing-boat-captain-arrest-2010&quot;&gt;Japan: Fishing Boat Captain Arrest (2010)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 8, 2010, a Chinese fishing vessel rammed two Japanese coast guard boats during a chase in the contested Senkaku/Diaoyu island chain. Japan is the effective administrator of the seas around the islands as per a 1997 fishery agreement between Tokyo and Beijing, making the islands subject to Japanese domestic law. As a result, the Chinese crew was detained and the captain arrested on suspicion of obstructing Japanese law enforcement due to alleged malicious behavior. While the crew was released after questioning, the captain remained in custody as Japanese prosecutors considered whether to indict him. On September 20, Japanese prosecutors announced a 10-day extension of the captain’s detention. Prior to this case, Japan had detained “Chinese-origin intruders” but had never threatened indictment. In considering an indictment in this case, Japan challenged the mutually understood 1997 agreement and note verbale precedent that the two countries would separate fishery disputes from territorial disputes, and that flag state law, not coastal state law, would apply to fishing activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINESE MEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the arrest, China lodged diplomatic protests, ceased intergovernmental contacts, and tightened customs inspections on Japanese imports. Chinese netizens called for a boycott of Japanese goods, and Chinese travel agencies canceled package tours to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rare Earths&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 20, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson warned China would “take strong counter measures if the Japanese side clings obstinately to its own course and doubles its mistakes, and Japan shall bear all the consequences.” The next day, Chinese customs officials began blocking shipments to Japan of rare earths, which had previously accounted for about half of China’s global rare earth exports. In July, China announced a 72 percent cut in global rare earth export quotas. While China justified the July cut as part of its efforts to improve environmental protection and bolster domestic supply, Japan, the United States, and the European Union faced market disruptions. Chinese premier Wen Jiabao emphasized in the days before the September 21 cutoff that Japan would face consequences for potentially detaining the fishing boat captain, but after the administrative block he (and MOFCOM) denied that an embargo was in effect. Without an explicit comment or pronouncement from China of an export ban, Japan opted not to file a WTO case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arrests of Japanese Nationals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 23, Chinese state media reported that four Japanese nationals had been arrested in China’s Hebei Province on September 21 for illegally entering a military zone without proper authorization and filming military targets. The four businessmen, all employees of a Japanese construction company, were in China working for a Japanese government project to reclaim World War II–era chemical weapons left by the Japanese Imperial Army. The Japanese government stated that the incident was unrelated to the captain’s arrest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAPANESE RESPONSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 23, the Japanese prosecutor announced it was dropping the case “in consideration of the Japan-China relationship.” The fishing boat captain returned to China on September 24, accompanied by officials from China’s foreign and agriculture ministries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTERMATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 25, after the captain returned home, China’s foreign ministry demanded an apology and compensation from Japan. Japan responded that the request was “completely groundless and unacceptable.” On September 28, China lifted the de facto rare earths export ban on Japan. The day before, Japan’s trade minister stated Japan should diversify its rare earth imports. Tightened Chinese inspections of Japanese imports were eased until 2012, when a dispute between the two countries over Japan’s nationalization of the disputed islands reignited tensions. On September 30, China released three of the four arrested Japanese nationals after they admitted wrongdoing and apologized; the fourth Japanese national was released on bail on October 9. Today the islands remain a source of contention between Tokyo and Beijing, with the two countries acknowledging since 2014 that “different positions exist” on the islands’ sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Japanese Policy toward Rare Earth Supply Chains&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011, following China’s 2010 trade coercion efforts, the Japanese government announced a $1.3 billion public-private initiative on rare earths to diversify sources, develop new materials, and reduce waste. As of July 2022, Japan had decreased its domestic share of Chinese rare earth imports from 90 percent to 58 percent. It intends to reach 50 percent in the next three years. The public-private initiative also led to Japan’s 2016 rescue of Australia-based Lynas Corporation. Lynas, the only non-China rare earths producer at the time, faced major debt and was poised to collapse just one year after its sole non-China competitor, U.S.-based Molycorp, folded. Japanese entities, including state-owned JOGMEC and trading company Sojitz Corporation, slashed Lynas’ loan interest rates and extended its payment deadlines from 2018 to 2020. Today, Lynas is the world’s largest non-China producer of separated rare earth materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reappraisal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years following the 2010 incident, some questioned whether any coercion had occurred. Two studies argued that the disruption in rare earth exports observed by Japanese industry in September 2010 more likely resulted from China’s July 2010 plan to curb global exports than from the fishing vessel incident. However, the timing of the reported import slowdown clearly affected Japan’s perception of the situation, even if statistics are inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;norway-liu-xiaobo-nobel-prize-2010&quot;&gt;Norway: Liu Xiaobo Nobel Prize (2010)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 8, 2010, the Norwegian Nobel Committee, composed of five members appointed by Norway’s parliament, selected Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo as the recipient of the Nobel Peace prize. The committee selected Liu “for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China.” At the time, Liu was imprisoned in China after having been convicted in 2009 of “inciting subversion of state power.” The king and queen of Norway attended the ceremony on December 10, 2010, where Liu’s seat sat empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINESE MEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the ceremony, in November, the Chinese embassy in Oslo sent letters requesting foreign dignitaries not attend (ultimately, 19 countries did not send a representative). The day before the December 10 ceremony, China’s foreign ministry took aim at the Norwegian government, with a spokesperson stating, “By openly supporting the extremely erroneous decision by the Nobel Committee, the Norwegian Government has destroyed the political foundation and environment for cooperation in bilateral relations.” At a December 11 press conference, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Jiang Yu discussed the prize ceremony at length, further criticizing the Norwegian government. China then commenced an implicit diplomatic freeze that continued until 2016, ceasing free trade discussions and the conveyance of visas to Norwegian officials. In October 2011, the Chinese embassy in Oslo released a statement saying, “The current Sino-Norwegian relations [are] in difficulty because the Norwegian Nobel Committee granted last year’s Nobel Peace Prize to a Chinese criminal serving jail term in China, and the Norwegian Government supported this wrong decision.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salmon-Related Restrictions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 13, 2010, the Chinese government instituted new inspection and quarantine procedures for Norwegian aquaculture imports. On January 20, 2011, China’s inspection and quarantine authority released a notice to safeguard Chinese consumers by strengthening inspections and quarantines on imported salmon. Norwegian salmon fell from 94 percent of China’s salmon imports in 2010 to just 2 percent in 2016. Former diplomats also reported that Norwegian SOEs faced unjustified difficulties in obtaining contracts in China. In June 2012, a former Norwegian prime minister was denied a visa for a visit to China in what was assumed, but not explicitly confirmed, retaliation for the Nobel Peace Prize. In December 2012, China excluded Norway from a policy that allowed visa-free trips to Beijing for visitors from all 27 EU members plus Switzerland and Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NORWEGIAN RESPONSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 8, 2010, Norwegian foreign minister Jonas Gahr Stoere attempted to preempt China’s anger by emphasizing the independence of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. In June 2011, the Norwegian government reached out to China through the WTO to obtain clarification on the Chinese government’s salmon-related directives. China’s responses emphasized that the measures were not targeted at Norway specifically and that it had seen evidence of contaminants in Norwegian salmon. To bypass China’s strict and untimely salmon checks, Norwegian salmon exports to China were rerouted through Vietnam, with Norwegian salmon exports to Vietnam growing 17-fold between 2010 and 2013. In May 2013, there was speculation Norway might block China’s application for an observer seat at the Arctic Council, but China was ultimately admitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2014, high-ranking Norwegian officials explicitly declined to meet with the Dalai Lama when he visited Oslo that same month. Critics accused the Norwegian government of bowing to Chinese pressure, but the Norwegian government justified the decision to restore diplomatic relations with Beijing on the basis of advancing progress on human rights and climate change rather than a desire for economic gain. On September 11, 2014, with Chinese restrictions on salmon imports ongoing, Norway’s education ministry withdrew approval for a largely China-funded radar antenna in Svalbard, designed for research purposes, based on a holistic assessment of the technology’s potential uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTERMATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 19, 2016, Norwegian foreign minister Børge Brende visited Beijing to hold talks with Premier Li Keqiang. The two countries’ foreign ministries issued a joint statement, with Norway expressing respect for China’s “development path and social system” and promising “not to support actions that undermine [China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity].” Following Brende’s visit, China and Norway announced that bilateral relations were again normalized. In July 2018, China lifted its restrictions on Norwegian salmon. While Norwegian citizens remain excluded from China’s 72-hour and 144-hour visa-free transit policies, China agreed to resume bilateral free trade discussions in 2017. However, progress on negotiations seemed to stall in 2022. As of early 2023, the most recent talks were held in March 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;philippines-scarborough-shoal-2012&quot;&gt;Philippines: Scarborough Shoal (2012)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 10, 2012, two Chinese surveillance ships intervened to prevent a Philippine navy warship from arresting the crews of eight Chinese fishing vessels that had dropped anchor near the contested Scarborough Shoal, an island chain in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea. The motivation for the attempted arrest stemmed from the Philippine navy’s alleged discovery of illegally held aquaculture on one of the fishing boats. The incident led to a standoff between the Chinese patrol vessels and the Philippine warship. Although the warship departed on April 12, a Philippine coast guard vessel soon arrived on the scene to continue the standoff, and the two Chinese vessels were joined by a third.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINESE MEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2012, before the shoal incident, China’s import inspection and testing authority raised concerns with the Philippines regarding mealybugs in Philippine banana exports. On May 2, following the incident, the same inspection authority expressed concerns about mealybugs in Philippine papayas and pineapples, even though Philippine shipments to Japan and South Korea had reportedly been cleared without issue. On May 7, China’s vice foreign minister warned the Philippines that prolonging the shoal standoff would tarnish bilateral relations between the two nations. Two days later, the Chinese military’s official newspaper published an editorial warning against efforts to undermine China’s claims to the shoal. On May 10, China refused 1,200 containers of Philippine bananas, again over mealybug concerns, leaving the fruit to rot at customs and — according to Philippine business leaders — causing the Philippine agricultural sector to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales in a few days. At the time, China purchased more than 30 percent of Philippine banana exports. China’s enhanced quarantine measures soon extended to papayas, pineapples, and other fruits including mangoes and coconuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also on May 10, it was reported that China had paused tourism packages to the Philippines and had issued a travel advisory for its citizens traveling to Manila. At the time, Chinese tourists represented about 9 percent of Philippine tourism arrivals. On May 16, China enacted a seasonal 10-week fishing ban in the waters surrounding the Scarborough Shoal, ostensibly to limit overfishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHILIPPINE RESPONSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the days following the April 10, 2012, incident, the Philippines requested China agree to an international court adjudication of the territorial dispute. China refused. In May, the then-Philippine economic planning secretary said in response to curbs on tourism and fruit exports to China, “We are likely to see modest effects (on the economy), but we need to intensify our efforts to diversify our trade with other countries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTERMATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2012, the United States brokered an agreement to resolve the standoff. Although the Philippines withdrew as part of the resolution, Chinese vessels remained in the area in apparent violation of the deal, which a top Chinese diplomat would later claim had never existed. Beginning in July 2012, China blockaded Philippine access to the Scarborough Shoal and drove Philippine fishermen away, asserting full maritime control of the area. In September, during the fishing off-season, a Philippine coast guard surveillance flight observed Chinese marine surveillance ships and Chinese law enforcement vessels near the shoal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diplomatic Dispute&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a July 2012 ASEAN ministerial, Philippine efforts to ensure the joint communiqué reflected concerns over the 2012 shoal incident were stymied by then-chair Cambodia, a close ally of Beijing. On January 22, 2013, the Philippines unilaterally initiated proceedings at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague, challenging China’s sovereignty over the Scarborough Shoal and the legality of China’s de facto occupation of the area. In April 2013, following the appeal, officials in Beijing warned of negative ramifications for Philippine industries if the arbitration process progressed. Making good on the promise, China applied pressure on the Philippines through continued food safety accusations, which escalated into an import ban on Philippine bananas and pineapples. These measures ultimately caused a more than two-thirds decline in Philippine banana exports to China 2014 to 2016. In August 2013, China appeared to disinvite President Aquino from attending the China-ASEAN trade fair. In February 2014, Aquino called on the international community to increase support for the Philippines as it resisted China’s South China Sea policy. China issued yet another travel advisory against the Philippines in September 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hague Court Ruling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration concluded the China-Philippines case, ruling unanimously in favor of the Philippines and finding that China’s claims of sovereignty over the area bounded by the nine-dash line were invalid and unsupported and that Chinese physical obstruction of Philippine vessels in the region was unlawful. While Australia, Japan, and the United States issued a joint statement urging China to comply with the court ruling, ASEAN in its 2016 ministerial joint communiqué ignored the ruling entirely, instead calling for self-restraint and urging the negotiation of a code of conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China rejected the Hague’s legally binding court ruling, which lacked an enforcement mechanism, and continued to assert its sovereignty in the area. Following the ruling, Chinese tourist arrivals to the Philippines dropped by 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rapprochement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016 the Philippines elected a new president, Rodrigo Duterte, who as mayor of Davao City had been denied a visa to the United States for his controversial war on drugs. Duterte took office in June 2016 after promising on the campaign trail to both defend the Philippines’ territorial claims and reopen bilateral dialogue with China. As president, he went on to pursue a more aggressive pivot toward China, ultimately dismissing the Hague ruling. On a visit to Beijing in October 2016, Duterte stated that the Philippines and the United States were now separate and that a bilateral reconciliation with China was underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the October visit, China and the Philippines signed 13 bilateral agreements, with China pledging $24 billion in investments toward infrastructure, transportation, renewable energy, urban development, tourism, and more. In addition, the two leaders struck a deal allowing Philippine fishermen access to the Scarborough Shoal. Following Duterte’s visit, China-Philippine relations rapidly warmed: Philippine banana exports to China soared, and Chinese tourists returned in large numbers. However, little of China’s promised $24 billion investment ever materialized. In addition, in 2017 China expanded its presence in Scarborough Shoal and resisted Philippine efforts to build shelters on Sandy Cay near the contested Spratly Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of President Duterte’s term, it remained unclear whether China exerted de facto control over Sandy Cay, despite Duterte asserting it remained in Philippine control. In September 2022, Duterte’s successor, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., expressed interest in negotiating an agreement with China over oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea. In November 2022, U.S. vice president Kamala Harris visited the Philippine island Palawan, which borders the South China Sea and is close to the disputed Spratly Islands, in a show of support for the Philippines “in defense of international rules and norms as it relates to the South China Sea.” A week prior, the Philippines announced plans to increase the number of U.S.-Philippine joint military facilities from five to ten. Harris’s visit came just days after a Chinese and Philippine military confrontation over a piece of Chinese rocket debris that a China coast guard vessel seized from a Philippine navy ship. In addition, on February 3, 2023, Manila announced the United States would station military equipment at four more locations in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;south-korea-thaad-deployment-2016&quot;&gt;South Korea: THAAD Deployment (2016)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 8, 2016, the United States and South Korea announced an agreement to deploy the THAAD missile system in South Korea. Designed to intercept ballistic missiles, the installation was aimed at countering the growing threat posed by North Korea’s ballistic missile program. However, China opposed the deployment, raising concerns that it would undermine its nuclear deterrent by degrading its second-strike capability. Beijing also expressed concerns that the system’s radar would be able to peer deep into China’s territory. At a higher level, Beijing felt that Seoul’s decision represented a South Korean alignment with what it perceived as a U.S.-led effort to contain China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 7, 2016, the South Korean government announced it had selected land owned by Korea’s fifth-largest conglomerate, Lotte, as the installation site for the batteries. The government reached a land-swap deal with Lotte in November 2016, and United States Forces Korea delivered the THAAD system’s key components in the early morning hours of April 26, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINESE MEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s decision to pursue THAAD installation despite the PRC’s official and unofficial opposition and threats led to a series of trade restrictions and consumer boycotts on Korean imports. Beginning in August 2016, Chinese regulators imposed new restrictions on South Korean cultural exports, including movies, television shows, video games, and musical performances. In March 2017, the PRC National Tourism Administration warned Chinese citizens to “recognize the risks of outbound tourism and carefully select [their] travel destinations” following PRC allegations of Chinese nationals being “obstructed” from entering South Korea’s Jeju Island, presumably by South Korean customs or immigration officials at Jeju International Airport. That same March, the China National Tourism Administration reportedly instructed travel agencies to halt the sale of group tour packages. This came after the agency had initially urged them to curtail the number of tourists by 20 percent the October prior. The result was that Chinese visitors to South Korea — who accounted for roughly half of overseas visitors to South Korea in 2016 — dropped by more than 60 percent from March to October 2017 compared with the same period the year prior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A February 2017 editorial published in the Global Times argued that, due to WTO obligations and the PRC–South Korea free trade agreement, Chinese consumers, not the government, should act as the main forces in sanctioning Korea, and that companies like Hyundai would “face disaster sooner or later” should “PRC–South Korea conflicts continue to escalate.” The following month, South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia blamed a 52 percent year-on-year drop in March sales in China, which ultimately led to a 30 percent year-on-year drop in 2017 China sales, on low “consumer sentiment” in a joint statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 29, 2016, the PRC Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), MOST, and National Development and Reform Commission issued a joint statement announcing the government would subsidize 498 electric vehicle models, including some with batteries produced by South Korean firms LG and Samsung. However, the same day, the ministries inexplicably retracted their support for five models with these firms’ batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owing to its involvement in the THAAD land-swap deal, Lotte experienced the brunt of Beijing’s wrath through both consumer boycotts and stepped-up arbitrary inspections. As coercive pressures on Lotte intensified, the retail conglomerate found itself forced to close 87 of its 99 stores in China in response to alleged fire code violations. Chinese authorities also published a formal travel advisory against South Korea, and customs officials increased arbitrary inspections of Korean commodity imports. China largely refrained from initiating major new coercive policies after the May 2017 election of President Moon Jae-in, who had campaigned on restarting dialogue with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KOREAN RESPONSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hampered by a political crisis that culminated in the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye, Seoul initially took time to formulate its response. In March 2017, it launched a campaign to reduce export reliance on China by expanding its trade relationships with ASEAN and India. Shortly thereafter, the South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism announced measures to support the culture industry, including by expanding eligibility for subsidized loans to include companies suffering “damage from protectionism.” Seoul also filed a WTO complaint against China on March 19, though it ultimately elected not to pursue it further for fear it might hinder cooperation with Beijing over constraining North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. In April 2017, President Trump met with President Xi to clarify the U.S. position on THAAD and relieve pressure on South Korea. The following month, President Moon accepted a last-minute invitation to attend the Silk Road summit in Beijing. In July, Moon promised to extend to Korean manufacturing businesses that chose to reshore their facilities the same benefits as it gives foreign investors. South Korea’s trade minister also met with major Korean tech firms in September, reportedly recommending that Samsung’s management team review its planned $7 billion expansion in Xi’an.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dispute over THAAD thawed significantly after an October 30 speech in which South Korean foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha promulgated her government’s Three Nos policy of simultaneous opposition to additional THAAD deployment, participation in the U.S. missile defense network, and any future trilateral alliance with the U.S. and Japan. Just days before, the Moon administration had announced its plans to approve billions of dollars in new foreign direct investment from South Korean companies in China, including Samsung, as part of a “surprise package” intended to help ameliorate tensions. Moon met with Xi in November 2017 on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam, during which the two sides formally agreed to normalize relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTERMATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late October 2017, the Chinese and South Korean foreign ministries published statements agreeing to bring relations between the two countries back to normal. Although the THAAD batteries would remain in South Korea, Chinese tourism flows soon revived, Korean exports to China recovered, investment in China picked up pace, and the two governments renewed their $56 billion bilateral currency swap arrangement. Lotte, however, failed to recover from the episode and has since closed its last store in China. Following the dispute, the Moon administration unveiled its New Southern Policy, an effort to strengthen South Korea’s resilience to threats of economic coercion through trade diversification. Under President Yoon Suk Yeol, the New Southern Policy has transformed into the ABCD strategy (shorthand for Advance human capital, Build health security, Connect cultures, and Digitize Asian infrastructure), which seeks to expand South Korean economic and cultural engagement with Southeast Asia and India. Having campaigned on a promise to activate the as-yet unused THAAD system, he has also downplayed his predecessor’s Three Nos policy, saying it was “not a promise or agreement we made with China, but an explanation of our position.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mongolia-dalai-lama-visit-2016&quot;&gt;Mongolia: Dalai Lama Visit (2016)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a November 19–23, 2016, visit to Mongolia, the Dalai Lama told press that the rebirth of the Tenth Patriarch of Mongolian Buddhism, a sect of Yellow Hat Buddhism, had taken place in Mongolia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINESE MEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP views the Dalai Lama as a “splittist” who seeks Tibetan independence. China maintains that any hosting of the Dalai Lama by a foreign country constitutes interference in China’s core interests. Previously, Mongolia, due to its extensive cultural and historical ties with the leader of Tibetan Buddhism, had “ignored Chinese condemnation for Dalai Lama visits.” Prior visits in 2002 and 2006 saw China close its border and cancel flights from Beijing. Ahead of the Lama’s 2016 visit, the Chinese government urged Mongolia to deny the Lama’s visa to maintain “sound and steady ties.” Mongolia responded to Chinese warnings that the visit was a religious event and that the religious leader would not meet with government officials. In addition, the CCP’s United Front Work Department maintains a system to oversee and manage the reincarnation of Buddhist lamas. The Dalai Lama’s declaration challenged that system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On November 25, China indefinitely postponed bilateral meetings scheduled for the following week, which were set to cover soft loan negotiations and joint infrastructure projects. A week after the visit, China imposed fees and transit costs on Mongolian commodity shipments into China at a major border crossing, leading to major delays. China also canceled ongoing negotiations for a $4.2 billion loan to assist Mongolia with debt repayment. At the time, Mongolia depended on China for 84.1 percent of its exports and faced economic pressure exacerbated by currency depreciation, stark FDI downturns, and low global commodities prices. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson refused to draw a connection between the tariffs and the Dalai Lama’s visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTERMATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 21, Mongolia foreign minister Munkh-Orgil Tsend conceded, “The government feels sorry for this. . . . The Dalai Lama probably won’t be visiting Mongolia again during this administration.” In January 2017, China ceased its coercion efforts. A readout of a phone call between the two countries’ foreign ministers stated that Beijing “hoped Mongolia had taken this lesson to heart.” Tsend stated, “Mongolia . . . consistently holds that Tibet is an inseparable part of China, that the Tibet issue is China’s internal affair.” In February, the two foreign ministers met in Beijing to discuss future cooperation. Tsend reiterated that Mongolia would no longer permit visits by the Dalai Lama. However, the July presidential runoff election saw the election of the more anti-China candidate, Khaltmaagiin Battulga, who in August cast doubt on Mongolia’s commitment to its promise to prohibit visits by the Dalai Lama in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;australia-antiforeign-interference-lawcall-for-covid-19-investigation-20172020&quot;&gt;Australia: Anti–foreign Interference Law/Call for Covid-19 Investigation (2017/2020)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 7, 2017, Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull introduced legislation to Parliament aimed at countering foreign interference in Australian politics. The legislation followed the delivery of a classified Australian Security Intelligence Organization report addressing foreign influence in Australia’s political system. The anti–foreign interference bill, titled National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017, included an update to the legal definitions of treason, espionage, and sabotage; a ban on foreign political donations; and the institution of a foreign influence registry, among other measures. In a speech about the bill, Turnbull addressed media reports about interference by the CCP and vowed to target “covert, coercive or corrupting behavior.” Turnbull also explicitly referenced a 1949 speech delivered by China’s founder Mao Zedong, stating the people of Australia would “stand up.” After China’s foreign ministry criticized Turnbull’s statement, the prime minister repeated the phrase on December 9 in Mandarin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINESE MEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 12, 2018, several months after the anti–foreign interference law’s introduction, Prime Minister Turnbull acknowledged that Australia-China relations were suffering. Turnbull’s comments came the day after the Boao Forum for Asia, a major Chinese-hosted international conference, had concluded. No Australian ministers had received an invitation. Beyond Boao, contemporary media reports stated that China had instituted a broader diplomatic freeze, effectively blocking the issuance of visas to Australian diplomats by failing to issue formal invitations. The freeze extended to interactions between the Chinese government and the Australian embassy in Beijing, which took on a tone of “extreme formality.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s response also included trade restrictions. In May, a deal between China and Australian beef producers worth $500 million was halted. On May 22, the Chinese state-run outlet Global Times called for Beijing to cut imports of Australian beef and wine. On May 17, Australian wine producer Treasury Wine Estates reported its products faced heightened customs hurdles entering China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUSTRALIAN RESPONSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s anti–foreign interference law was assented to on June 29, 2018, and became law on December 10. Australia-China bilateral relations have remained on unstable ground since the dispute, and Australia continued to challenge China on several issues in the face of Beijing’s economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Further Disputes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei. Despite the threat of economic coercion, Australia again challenged China in August 2018 when it became the first country to exclude Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei’s equipment from domestic 5G infrastructure. China’s commerce ministry warned the move would have a “negative impact on the commercial interests of Chinese and Australian companies.” In February 2019, Chinese ports temporarily curbed coal imports from Australia, with ports in Dalian instituting a ban; a connection to the Huawei exclusion was posited at the time but not confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade and investment actions. Australia blocked Chinese investment in its largest gas pipeline on national security grounds in November 2018. In February 2020, Australia initiated an antidumping investigation into Chinese steel and aluminum products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Covid-19 origins investigation. In April 2020, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison again challenged China by calling for a WHO-led investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 virus. China responded by instituting import suspensions or delays of a swath of Australian products, including beef, barley, cotton, wine, timber, lobster, and coal. In June 2020, Morrison stated, “I’m never going to trade our values in response to coercion.” On November 18, 2020, a Chinese government document was “deliberately leaked” to the Australian press outlining 14 Chinese grievances against Australia. The list included reference to the anti–foreign interference legislation, the Huawei ban, a call for an independent investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 virus, and more. In December 2020 and June 2021, Australia brought cases to the WTO over Chinese measures against Australian barley and wine, respectively. China responded in June 2021 with a WTO case of its own over Australian remedial duties on several Chinese products, including railway wheels and wind towers. All three cases are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTERMATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2022, China’s diplomatic freeze toward Australia, which began in 2018 following the anti–foreign interference law’s introduction and continued in 2020 following Canberra’s calls for a Covid-19 investigation, ended when President Xi Jinping met with Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese on the sidelines of the G20. Albanese described the meeting as “warm” but stated it would not lead to an immediate resolution of the ongoing trade dispute. Albanese’s meeting with Xi was followed a month later by Australian foreign affairs minister Penny Wong’s visit to Beijing; Wong was the first Australian minister to do so in three years. It appears Australian-Chinese relations may be thawing slightly, without Canberra altering its policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;canada-meng-wanzhou-extradition-2018&quot;&gt;Canada: Meng Wanzhou Extradition (2018)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 1, 2018, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested Meng, the CFO of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. At the time, Meng was in Vancouver during a transit stop. Her arrest was prompted by a U.S. warrant on charges of financial fraud linked to the company’s alleged efforts to evade Iran sanctions and set up an extradition battle in the Canadian courts. The Chinese government considered the arrest an infringement on Meng’s rights, an abuse of the extradition treaty between the United States and Canada, and a politically motivated attack on a major Chinese company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINESE MEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Meng’s arrest, Beijing made diplomatic protests demanding the United States and Canada “correct their wrong behavior” and free Meng. On December 8, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Canada’s ambassador in Beijing and warned his country would face “grave consequences” if Meng were not released. Within a week, Chinese authorities had detained two Canadian citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, on charges of “engaging in activities that endanger China’s national security.” Although Beijing officially denied any connection with Meng’s extradition case, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry later linked the two cases by suggesting the release of Meng could lead to the release of the detained Canadians. A month after the arrest of the two Michaels, an appeals court in Dalian made the unusual decision to increase the drug smuggling sentence of Canadian citizen Robert Schellenberg from 15 years imprisonment to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 15, 2019, China released a statement advising against travel to Canada, resulting in a precipitous decline of Chinese immigration and tourism visa applications. In March 2019, China revoked the import licenses of two of Canada’s leading canola exporters, leading to a 70 percent decline in Canada’s annual canola seed exports to China. According to one study, the combined effect of lost business and lower prices cost Canadian canola producers between C$1.54 billion and C$2.35 billion from March 2019 to July 2020. Canada is the world’s largest canola seed exporter, and in 2018 China imported 94 percent of its canola seeds from Canada, accounting for 35 percent of Canada’s total exports of the commodity. To make up for the foregone supply, Chinese buyers increased canola seed purchases from Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and Ukraine. Beijing also curbed imports of Canadian peas and soybeans, while Canadian pork shipments encountered new administrative barriers in Chinese ports. The initial measures against Canadian pork and beef were expanded in June to include a suspension of all Canadian meat exports after inspectors allegedly found falsified customs certificates. China only lifted the ban on Canadian pork in November 2019 in response to a devastating African swine flu outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANADIAN RESPONSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the arrest of the two Michaels, the Canadian government issued a travel advisory citing the risk of subjective law enforcement faced by visitors to China. On December 22, Ottawa launched an international campaign to free Kovrig and Spavor, with the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, and Australia all issuing statements in support. In July, the Canadian agriculture minister announced new investment support packages for the country’s pork, grain, and oilseed industries aimed at helping domestic exporters find new markets. In August 2020, it was reported that crop shortages had boosted the price of Canada’s canola seed exports despite China’s coercive measures and that China continued to import Canadian canola indirectly through third countries. In July 2021, the WTO agreed to establish a panel at Canada’s request to examine China’s use of import barriers without having provided adequate scientific evidence of their stated rationale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTERMATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing finally released Kovrig and Spavor on September 24, 2021, as part of a U.S.-Canada-China diplomatic swap for Meng. Although Meng had been released on bail and kept under house arrest since December 2018, it was not until September 25, 2021 — after her lawyers had brokered a deferred prosecution agreement with U.S. officials in which Meng accepted some responsibility for the fraud claims against Huawei — that Canadian authorities allowed her to return to China. When the requested WTO dispute panel convened that same month, Chinese and Canadian officials shared they had agreed to open additional communication and to allow for an arbitrator to rule on potential appeals of the resulting panel report. In May 2022, Beijing finally lifted its three-year ban on imports from Richardson Oilseed and Viterra, Canada’s two largest canola producers. Ottawa requested the suspension of the WTO dispute settlement panel in August 2022, and as of October 2022 the bilateral canola trade appeared to have rebounded, with monthly shipments to China up 21 percent year-on-year. Canada has not softened its stance toward China following the dispute. In December 2022, Canadian foreign minister Mélanie Joly stated, “We will challenge China when it comes to international order being respected.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lithuania-taiwanese-representative-office-2021&quot;&gt;Lithuania: Taiwanese Representative Office (2021)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2021, Taiwan announced it would open a TRO in Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius. Although Taiwan maintains representative offices in other countries, including the United States, all other offices operate under the name Taipei in lieu of Taiwan, meaning the Vilnius office challenged an established norm. Under a center-right government formed after the October 2020 elections, Lithuania had taken other actions against China, including postponing a Beijing-supported deep-water port project, withdrawing from the 17+1 initiative, banning a Chinese state-controlled company from supplying Lithuanian airports with X-ray scanners, and amending laws to exclude “unreliable” digital telecommunications manufacturers and suppliers from Lithuania’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINESE MEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2021, following the TRO announcement, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office warned Lithuania “not to ‘send the wrong signals to Taiwan independence forces.’” On August 10, Beijing demanded Lithuania recall its ambassador to China, promising to withdraw its own ambassador from Lithuania as well. That same month, China reportedly ceased providing permits for Lithuanian food imports. Freight from China’s state-owned rail operator CRCT to Lithuania also ceased, though Chinese state media denied that an order had been relayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also reported in August that China had pressured U.S.-based Thermo Fisher Scientific, a major investor in Lithuania, to lobby Vilnius to reconsider its plan. In September, Lithuanian media reported that domestic companies in timber, grain, and other industries were encountering difficulties renewing and closing contracts with Chinese partners to purchase raw materials. In November, just before the TRO opened, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson stated, “The Lithuanian side shall be responsible for all the ensuing consequences.” Soon after the TRO opened on November 18, China downgraded its diplomatic relations with Lithuania and further restricted trade, effectively instituting an embargo, with Lithuania disappearing from China’s custom’s list. Customs data showed that trade in goods from Lithuania to China dropped 90 percent month-on-month and year-on-year. In December, the president of a major Lithuanian trade association said 60 companies were having trouble exporting products to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LITHUANIAN RESPONSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2022, amid ongoing pressure, Lithuania’s government blocked its state-owned rail operator from contracting with a Chinese-owned Spanish bridge-building company due to national security concerns. In late January, the European Union, of which Lithuania is a member, lodged a complaint at the WTO over China’s de facto embargo. Following the European Union’s request for consultation, China officially suspended imports of Lithuanian beef, milk, and beer without presenting cause. Also in January, German companies began to pressure Lithuania after China began blocking German imports over Lithuanian components, prompting the German-Baltic Chamber of Commerce to request that Lithuania seek a “constructive solution.” Lithuanian president Gitanas Nausėda admitted that the TRO name issue had been a mistake but did not call for a name change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lasers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Lithuania’s exports to China only accounted for around 1 percent of total exports prior to the restrictions, the slowdown had an outsized effect on Lithuania’s export-oriented industrial and scientific laser sector. Lithuania produces about 50 percent of the world’s ultrashort scientific lasers, and China accounts for 30 percent of the country’s total laser exports to manufacturing customers. After restricting imports from Lithuania, lasers produced in other countries, including Germany, France, the United States, and the Netherlands, were substituted in, hurting the Lithuanian industry’s competitiveness. Apart from its economic importance, the laser industry is also a politically influential industry in Lithuania that enjoys popular support for its work with the Lithuanian military and NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTERMATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s apparent embargo against Lithuania led to vocal support and investment commitments from Taiwan, the United States, and the European Union. For example, in January 2022, Taiwan announced it would establish a $200 million fund for investment in Lithuania, stating laser technology as a priority. However, it was unclear how much funding had reached Lithuanian firms by the end of 2022. That said, more recent reporting indicates that Taiwan remains committed to aiding Lithuanian firms. Despite acknowledgement from the Lithuanian government that China’s aggressive reaction to the TRO was unanticipated, Vilnius has not shifted its stance. Along with requesting consultation at the WTO (the case is ongoing), the European Union has fast-tracked its proposed ACI — a framework designed to deter coercion through engagement and, as a last resort, to retaliate with restrictions. While Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 shifted attention away from the dispute, Lithuania has remained close to Taiwan, with Foreign Minister Ingrida Šimonytė saying, “I don’t know whether this is something that, you know, that China can dictate.” In October 2022, Lithuania and Japan upgraded their diplomatic ties and launched a security dialogue. In November 2022, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz made oblique reference to Lithuania during a trip to Beijing, saying, “Economic measures against individual EU member states are directed against the entire EU single market.” Also in November, the head of the TRO in Vilnius stated Taiwan would invest around €10 million in Lithuanian company Teltonika to develop Lithuania’s semiconductor manufacturing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case - Japan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese prosecutors quickly dropped the legal case against the Chinese fishing boat captain and authorized his release, but Tokyo did not give in to demands to apologize or compensate China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s alleged restrictions of rare earth exports to Japan kickstarted a concerted policy effort to develop new sources of rare earth supply and rare earth substitutes for Japanese industry that continues to the present. Meanwhile, Japan has continued to exert its jurisdiction over contested areas of the East China Sea. In 2012 the Japanese government angered China by purchasing the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. Although the move may have been intended to prevent hardliners in Japan from developing the islands, Japan continues to exercise administrative control, and the United States has since affirmed the disputed islands are covered under Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan defense treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall assessment - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s loss of faith in China as a supplier of rare earths galvanized a decade-long push to reduce its exposure and create alternative sources of production across the supply chain. Although expensive and time-consuming, this effort seems to have succeeded at significantly reducing China’s share of Japanese rare earth imports and opening new opportunities for Europe and the United States to follow suit. Despite veiled threats to curtail rare earth exports in subsequent years, China has so far refrained from doing so. While Japan acknowledges “different positions exist” on the Senkaku/Diaoyu ownership question, it continues to exercise de facto control over the islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case - Norway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite China’s informal import restrictions, exports of Norwegian salmon continued to find their way to China via third countries such as Vietnam. Norway continued to affirm the Nobel committee’s independence, and while declining to meet with the Dalai Lama, Norwegian officials canceled the Chinese-funded research antenna in Svalbard. The joint statement on normalization of relations struck a conciliatory tone but may be merely symbolic. It took six years for China to extract. Norway never issued the apology China demanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since China has removed its salmon import restrictions and certain visa rules targeting Norway, relations between the two countries have warmed somewhat, with Norway and China in ongoing negotiations on a bilateral free trade agreement. However, given the apparent ease with which Norway’s salmon industry adapted to Beijing’s controls, the direct causal link between China’s coercive tactics and subsequent détente is ambiguous. Although Norway did not officially ban Huawei, it opted to contract with Erickson for its 5G network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall assessment - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall effectiveness of China’s coercion campaign is mixed. Norway’s domestic salmon producers appear to have largely circumvented the trade controls, but Beijing’s strong negative response destabilized the relationship and may have induced some nominal concessions from Oslo. However, it is difficult to contribute those minor concessions directly to China’s economic coercion. In fact, the possibility of restarting negotiations on the free trade agreement and restoring diplomatic channels of communication may have asserted a stronger pull on Norwegian officials than the ineffective trade restrictions. The concessions seem largely symbolic and did not deter Norway from choosing a provider other than Huawei for its 5G networks. The free trade negotiations may now be stalling due to Norwegian concerns about China’s intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case - Philippines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Win&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China prevented the arrest of the Chinese crew members and ultimately gained control of the Scarborough Shoal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2016 Hague ruling undermined the international standing of China’s South China Sea claims, but since it was unenforceable, the Scarborough Shoal remains under Chinese control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall assessment - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed win&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines is deepening its economic ties with China. China has successfully increased its holdings throughout the South China Sea, though it does not maintain exclusive control. The 2016 Hague ruling has not reshaped the South China Sea status quo. More recently, the Philippines announced it would be deepening its military cooperation with the United States by allowing the U.S. military access to more bases on Philippine territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case - South Korea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The South Korean government agreed to the Three Nos, but the THAAD deployments remained in place. Trade between Korea and China actually increased during this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic coercion contributed to a decline in the Korean public’s perception of China. President Moon initiated the New Southern Policy to decrease economic dependence on China. President Yoon campaigned on a more hawkish China policy and has insinuated that his administration may not continue to abide by the Three Nos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall assessment - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China failed to compel South Korea to renege on its agreement to allow the United States to deploy the THAAD missile systems. The concession in the form of the Three Nos that China did extract from Korea may not outlast the Yoon administration. In the long term, the United States succeeded in deploying the missile systems, which remain in place, while China damaged its image with the Korean public and further incentivized the Moon administration to decrease Korea’s economic dependence on China via the New Southern Policy, a policy the Yoon administration seems set to continue, if under a different name. China’s bullying behavior also pushed Korea into greater strategic alignment with the United States, a grave strategic error given that in the 2000s there were conversations in Seoul about deepening the relationship with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case - Mongolia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed win&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mongolia quickly conceded to Beijing’s demands after the visit took place, with a Mongolian minister quoted as saying, “Mongolia firmly supports the one China policy, consistently holds that Tibet is an inseparable part of China, that the Tibet issue is China’s internal affair.” However, China’s threats of economic coercion in the run-up to the visit were insufficient to prevent the visit from happening in the first place. Likewise, President Battulga quickly raised doubts about Mongolia’s commitment to never allowing a future visit by the Dalai Lama after his election in July 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed win&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic coercion likely contributed to the election of President Battulga in July 2017, the more anti-China candidate. However, Battulga was barred from a second term due to changes to the Mongolian constitution, and his successor Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh has sought engagement with Beijing. On November 27–28, 2022, Xi Jinping received Khurelsukh for a state visit, where the two leaders issued the Joint Statement on Advancing the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in the New Era between the People’s Republic of China and Mongolia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall assessment - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed win&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s economic coercion partially achieved its objective. Mongolia still allowed the visit to happen but quickly apologized. Likewise, though Mongolia has made good on its promise not to invite the Dalai Lama back, President Battulga’s comments raise questions about the commitment’s long-term resilience. Although there have been reports Mongolia is trying to distance itself from China, this does not seem attributable to the case of coercion but instead larger structural forces. Moreover, a November 2022 state visit and deepening bilateral economic relationship suggest Mongolian-Chinese relations are improving, not deteriorating. But, again, there are larger structural forces driving this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case - Australia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither China’s threats of coercive action nor its implemented controls on Australian imports appear to have swayed Australian policy or political rhetoric in a direction favorable to Beijing. Recent reporting suggests that China may be backing down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia has responded to China’s economic coercion campaign by persisting in its offending policy positions (the Huawei 5G ban, the anti–foreign influence law, calls for an investigation of the origins of the Covid-19 virus) while more closely aligning itself with the United States through plurilateral partnerships such as the Quad and AUKUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall assessment - &lt;strong&gt;Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The China-Australia trade dispute is still ongoing at the time of writing, but Beijing’s attempts to squeeze Australian imports have thus far failed to extract meaningful policy concessions. If anything, Beijing’s actions appear to have backfired by causing a hardening of attitudes both among policymakers in Canberra and the Australian public, with a more widespread perception taking hold of China as a strategic threat. Now it appears China may even be attempting to improve relations without Canberra backing down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case - Canada&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian authorities released Meng after the U.S. Justice Department agreed to defer judgment in exchange for Meng entering a “statement of facts,” in which she effectively admitted responsibility without pleading guilty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada later banned Huawei from its 5G networks, and in December 2022, the Canadian foreign minister stated, “We will challenge China when it comes to international order being respected.” The Canadian public’s perception of China also fell sharply after Meng’s arrest and China’s retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall assessment - &lt;strong&gt;Mixed loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada and the United States have insisted politics did not interfere in the case. However, deferred judgments are reportedly rare when the defendant is a high-profile individual. This could indicate the United States felt its case was weak or that it simply hoped to relieve pressure on Canada. Nevertheless, Meng’s statement of facts could still be used in a future case against Huawei, and it seems China’s hostage taking, rather than its coercive economic measures, had the greatest political effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case - Lithuania&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lithuanian president conceded the name change may have been a mistake. The German-Baltic Chamber of Commerce, along with the German auto parts firm Continental, pressured Vilnius to change the name, and the Lithuanian laser industry was broadly unhappy with the decision. However, the name of the representative office remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic outcome - &lt;strong&gt;Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithuania had been trending more hawkish toward China prior to the naming incident. Although a survey conducted several months after the name change showed a majority of Lithuanians disagreed with Vilnius’ decision, China’s aggressive response accelerated EU support for the ACI, ironically refocusing a policy debate that had its origins in the Trump administration’s trade policy. China’s coercion of Lithuania has also raised Lithuania’s profile in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall assessment - &lt;strong&gt;Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s coercion prompted the Lithuanian president to express regret. However, in the Lithuanian political system, the president has little power and, unlike the prime minister, is directly elected, making the office more beholden to public opinion. Interestingly, public opinion in Lithuania seemed opposed to the decision to provocatively name the representative office. That said, the Lithuanian government has expressed opposition to authoritarian systems, informed in part by Lithuania’s history as a Soviet republic, and it is doubtful China’s coercion has done anything to bolster Lithuanian perceptions of China. Should the European Union adopt the ACI, this would represent a rare speedy adoption of a major piece of policy by the commission.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;區諾軒：民主派就財案一致投票僅為戴耀廷假設 非各人「共同願景」&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;區諾軒：戴耀廷處理初選「有唔民主嘅地方」 後期「似乎變成一派拉倒一派」&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;區諾軒對多名參選人「政治表態」感無奈、若被DQ會「白費好多人心機」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ho5QOLM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（20日）踏入審訊第28天。區諾軒今開始接受代表何桂藍的大狀盤問，同意依賴功能組別才能取得立會過半，而民主派要勝出該界別很困難、該界別亦不會違背業界利益投票，但組織者從沒討論如何爭取他們支持。區諾軒同意辯方指，戴耀廷將立會過半形容為「大殺傷力憲制武器」是「有缺陷（flawed）」，因民主派一致投票僅是戴耀廷的假設，而非各人「共同願景」，重申戴耀廷「盲點」是沒看到功能組別真正想法。區亦同意，若立會無法過半，功能組別和建制派阻礙民主派議案的格局將維持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒被邀協調初選-指曾任民陣召集人較中立能與各派交涉&quot;&gt;區諾軒被邀協調初選 指曾任民陣召集人、較中立、能與各派交涉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今開始接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問。Beel 先由2020年1月底的飯局問起，區確認，當初由李永達致電聯絡他出席，指將有立法會選舉，民主派要進行協調工作，問他「會唔會考慮出嚟傾吓」。Beel 問為何會選區諾軒協助協調？區承認當時他們曾考慮或邀請其他人選，而準則是望找一些不屬任何黨派、較中立的人士，可以與不同派系交涉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問區有何相關的背景或技巧。區指他曾為民主黨黨員、接替被取消資格的周庭參選立法會以及擔任民陣召集人，而民陣工作正正是在辦遊行或商討議題上與不同派系周旋，他過往的政治經歷令他有條件與不同派系交涉，該背景亦是他與李永達溝通時被李所認同。Beel 一度問區有否經驗建立「揀選候選人」的機制，惟區指描述不完全準確，更正為「建立一個機制去令到市民揀候選人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指飯局曾討論各區議席目標35係門檻35係目標&quot;&gt;區諾軒指飯局曾討論各區議席目標：35係門檻，35+係目標&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區承認，該次飯局是首次與戴耀廷見面，但此前已認識亦尊重他，同意出於禮貌和尊重，不會公開表達對戴的反對。區同意，飯局最初的目標是爭取民主派立會過半，有討論各選區取得「6 6 4 4 3」的議席，加上功能組別民主派現有議席，再贏多3到5席就能獲得35席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問飯局上是討論爭取35席抑或35+席，區指是後者，指「35係門檻，35+係目標」。Beel 續指，戴耀廷2019年12月的文章題為「立會奪半 走向真普選重要一步」，即爭取35席，故在飯局提及要35+，是更進一步？惟區指，雖然文章只提及「立會奪半」，但戴是「包含埋奪半底下一個質性上嘅意義」，即認為民主派奪半有「本質上的意義轉變」，亦提及作為多數派可以運用不同權力。區又指，「立會奪半一定唔只係35就完㗎」，強調民主派作為一個派別「參與選舉梗係要爭取最大嘅勝算啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意依賴功能組別取得立會過半-但組織者不曾詳細討論相關問題&quot;&gt;區同意依賴功能組別取得立會過半 但組織者不曾詳細討論相關問題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，若民主派只獲得35個議席，是否會陷入兩難，即要麼不選主席，要麼只餘下34票（因主席不能就預算案投票）？區答「所以一路都話，係民主派攞唔攞到多數議席嘅問題」，並在法官陳仲衡詢問下同意，在計劃期間沒有討論過民主派會否競逐立會主席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，在2016年立法會選舉，民主派地方直選和功能組別分別有18和7至9席，並需分別增至23席和13席才能取得立會過半，而飯局上雖有提過功能組別要贏取的議席數目，「但唔係重點。Beel 問，但他們應很依賴功能組別來取得過半議席？區同意，但指功能組別始終有太多不同界別，當時亦不清楚有誰會參選，「所以唔係一啲喺當時可以處理嘅事項。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，那在整個計劃期間，組織者之間有否討論如何爭取足夠的功能組別議席？區承認「冇認真地坐低詳細討論功能組別嘅問題，但喺戴耀廷嘅推算裡面，係有包括功能組別嘅因素在內」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒民主派勝出功能組別從來都難功能組別一向不會違背業界利益投票&quot;&gt;區諾軒：民主派勝出功能組別從來都難、功能組別一向不會違背業界利益投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示區諾軒4月帖文〈【功能組別 - 終極之戰】最後一個月，召喚所有BR人士搶攻〉，區籲「體育、演藝、文化及出版界」及「進出口界」的公司登記做選民。區同意當時留意到成為該兩個界別的選民門檻較低，而選民登記將截止，故籲市民登記以增加民主派在功能組別的勝算。Beel 提及，出版界的「三聯、商務、中華」有很多附屬公司但不屬民主派，區同意。Beel 並指出，因此要在該些功能界別爭取議席以取得立會過半是很困難（uphill battle），區答：「民主派勝出功能組別從來都難。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，另一困難是即使有足夠功能組別議席，但也不能要求他們按想要的方式投票。區指這是戴耀廷關心的問題，而「我從來都話，唔應該綑綁其他人當選後嘅工作」。Beel 續指，要求功能組別議員否決預算案，就像要求火雞支持過聖誕一樣（like turkeys voting for Christmas；意即「作出違背個人利益的決定」），因他們並不會違背業界利益。區指這是功能組別議員一直有的現象。區亦同意，不綑綁參選人否決是他辦初選的初心，亦同意有民主派當選後或不想否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指一致投票僅戴耀廷假設非共同願景-大殺傷力憲制武器概念有缺陷&quot;&gt;區指一致投票僅戴耀廷假設非共同願景 「大殺傷力憲制武器」概念有「缺陷」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，那區諾軒曾否想過，戴耀廷提出立會過半作為「大殺傷力憲制武器」，其實一開始就是有缺陷的（flawed from the outset）？即使作為「武器」，也只是「射空彈（firing blanks）」？區反問其意思是否「民主派現實上唔太可能一齊做到呢件事」，法官李運騰補充，Beel 的問題是若冷靜坐下來認真想想，便會立即發覺整個計劃都是不切實際（unrealistic）的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區回應，在3月的初選記者會，戴耀廷就運用否決權一事僅指不同人有不同想法，當時是「未傾得清楚」、「不經整合」，而後來戴耀廷的「盲點」是「冇睇到功能組別嘅人真正諗緊啲咩」。李運騰反問，但整個「35+計劃」之所以能實現，最基本不是假設民主派議員會作為一個整體投票嗎（will vote as one body）？區指這是戴耀廷提及「大殺傷力憲制武器」的假設。李問，但那不是各參與者的共同願景（common vision）？區再指「我認為大家係唔共同嘅」，並指若是共同，就不會出現協調會上的不同意見，之後6月亦有另一發展。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，他與戴耀廷辦初選的目標不同，他只想爭取立會過半，而戴則想更進一步，並在飯局提及立會過半作為「大殺傷力憲制武器」。Beel 再次問，區當時是否會發覺那概念是「有缺陷（flawed）」的？區答：「可以話係有瑕疵嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區承認組織者無討論如何爭取功能組別同意否決預算案當時的確冇關心&quot;&gt;區承認組織者無討論如何爭取功能組別同意否決預算案：當時的確冇關心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒其後同意，他與趙家賢「幾乎冇」就爭取功能組別支持的困難討論，只是就初選行政事務交流。至於戴耀廷，他們曾考慮是否讓社會福利界、教育界和衞生服務界參與初選，但只是對爭取的功能組別議席數量（13席）有「評估（assessment）」，並互相知會大約有什麼人出選，「但係冇詳細討論過點樣拎13席返嚟」，亦無討論背後困難。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 一度指，區諾軒主要集中在協調地區直選，區指「唔單止」，因他始終有參與沈旭暉的功能組別交流會。區並指，要爭取13席，即目標要從建制派手上贏取4席，相關參選人士包括進出口界林景楠、工程界黃偉信、批發及零售界張秀賢、飲食界林瑞華，他於6月尾得知周小龍有意參選體育、演藝、文化及出版界，建築、測量、都市規劃及園境界亦有人參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，故如何讓功能組別參選人同意否決預算案的議題曾否被組織者討論，抑或被放在一旁？區承認「當時的確冇關心」。Beel 再問，那他們有否預期有落選者會繼續報名參選立會？區指有預期，故設立了機制，如有人違反「就唔會得到35+嘅支持」，但區也同意不能阻止人參選，因此行為屬違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒預期立會無法過半-功能組別及建制派阻礙民主派議格局將維持&quot;&gt;區諾軒預期立會無法過半 功能組別及建制派阻礙民主派議格局將維持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後展示區諾軒於3月11日發表的文章〈暫別前，只想一齊贏一次（一）〉，提及民主陣營本身主張已有根本分歧，難以要求各派承諾什麼。區同意當時他對能否在立會奪半有疑惑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章續提到「功能組別壟斷立法會的格局，是回歸以來中共、港共一再僭越多數人意願的手段」。區解釋，功能組別投票基礎不夠廣闊，但在立會卻坐擁分組點票優勢，即議員提出的議案須地區直選和功能組別均取得過半數才能通過，以致過往大多數市民支持的政策，由議員提案後都會遭功能組別分組點票否決。區同意辯方指，功能組別是阻礙了地區直選議員的意願，而議會上三分一的建制派亦經常阻礙民主派提出的議案。Beel 問，他亦預期2020年立法會將發生同樣情況？區同意，指特別是立會無法過半，格局將會維持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章續提及，「推動立法會過半，是謀求改變吃人的格局」，區解釋，當時正值反修例運動，而過往立法會的確有很多由建制派提出的議案違反很多港人意願，故他形容是「吃人的格局」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（20日）踏入審訊第28天。區諾軒繼續接受盤問，表示參與者對否決預算案有不同意見，惟戴耀廷卻「側埋一邊」，不斷撰文提倡用否決權及「攬炒十步」，是「有問題」亦不尊重與會者意見。法官陳慶偉問戴的做法是否「不民主」，區重申對新東文件使用「會運用」否決權字眼感「好費解」，亦對新西文件採用「會運用」字眼「後知後覺」，難以接受過程是民主，還柙期間收到新西會議謄本亦「好難受」。他又指，從政以來一直「求同存異」、尋找「最大公因數」，但初選後期「似乎變成一派拉倒一派」，反問：「作為組織者，難道唔係要做一個中立仲裁嘅人咩？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指戴耀廷寫文章從不與組織者商討側埋一邊講否決權不尊重與會者意見&quot;&gt;區指戴耀廷寫文章從不與組織者商討、「側埋一邊」講否決權不尊重與會者意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒繼續接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問，同意依賴功能組別才能取得立會過半，而民主派要勝出該界別很困難、該界別不會違背業界利益投票，但組織者從沒詳細討論如何爭取他們支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問及，區諾軒在3月時曾否與戴耀廷談及達成「35+」計劃可能遇到的問題或障礙（pitfalls or obstacles），法官李運騰補充即包括功能組別出於業界利益或不會否決預算案。區指就投票的問題，當時是「從來冇討論過」，並一邊搖頭一邊用力說：「特別係戴耀廷出文章嘅時候，我覺得有個好大嘅問題就係，佢從來唔會搵我哋啲組織者去傾。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，35+的基本假設，是民主派運用否決權迫使政府回應訴求，但區當時已發現計劃的問題，即功能組別或不會否決預算案，而這會令計劃失敗。區同意當時已看到該問題，「所以我對於個計劃嘅理解，同戴耀廷對於個計劃嘅理解，係有差異嘅。」李問他有否與戴談及？區指他最初沒有關心該議題，是直至5月5日第二次新東會議後才首次與戴有衝突，因當時參與者會上出現分歧，故即使區一直認為運用憲制權力否決預算案沒理由違法，「但冇可能讓到唔同嘅聲音不被尊重。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區並指，「更何況係佢（戴耀廷）4月份出嘅幾篇文章」，包括〈真攬炒十步〉。區指，最初覺得一個人寫文章是「文責自負」，但當看到參與者有不同意見，「而佢側埋一邊，不斷地去講話要用否決權呢，仲要發展咗一個十部曲嘅觀點，我認為喺組織工作上面係有問題嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，故當時戴耀廷不純粹是一個協調者（facilitator），而是有所提倡（proposing something）？區同意。李再問，戴是將計劃帶領向一個方向（steering the scheme to one direction）？區同意。區重申，是5月5日新東會議後才第一次向戴耀廷指出計劃問題，而戴一直指「合法冇問題」。陳慶偉指，這與區是沒有矛盾的，因區也認為是合法，區同意，「但係喺尊唔尊重與會者唔同意見上面呢，我認為佢係做得唔啱嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問戴不理他人意見是否不民主-區休庭後認過程有不民主之處&quot;&gt;官問戴不理他人意見是否「不民主」 區休庭後認過程有不民主之處&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指那是另一範疇，但就計劃的方向而言，二人並無矛盾。區續指，戴耀廷在很多次協調會議「都好在意講佢對於否決權嘅睇法」，且無論與會者立場為何，也嘗試用「會積極運用」字眼迎合。區指他不關心亦沒有這樣做，亦因協調會上不同意見無特別採取任何行動，是直至新東會議出現較鮮明的矛盾才向戴「提出異議」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉表示理解，並指35+作為一個促進民主的計劃，戴耀廷試圖將計劃引向一個特定方向、不理其他人意見的做法似乎是「不民主」（acting undemocratic）的，林卓廷、陳志全、施德來等發笑。區猶豫片刻沒有回應，陳問「還是我是錯的？（Or am I wrong？）」，區指「我要好謹慎咁答」，多人發笑，陳慶偉着他休庭後再回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區對新東文件用會運用感好費解見新西會議謄本感好難受&quot;&gt;區：對新東文件用「會運用」感「好費解」、見新西會議謄本感「好難受」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒在休庭後表示，記得戴耀廷在6月9日記者會曾強調「我哋組織者冇偏埋一邊」。區續指想大家回顧有關新東會議的過程：「我到而家都……對於份文件最後用『會運用』感到好費解，如果佢見到與會者嘅矛盾，而佢又有建議過『會積極運用』，點解到最後會出咗『會運用』？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，雖然他沒有出席新西5月8日的會議，但還柙期間與所有被告收到新西會議的文字謄本，「我覺得好難受，因為個過程我正正係覺得有唔民主嘅地方。」區指，戴耀廷只是「好簡單」向組織者交待該次會議，在開會後致電他稱「新界西同新界東差唔多，但嗰分別係要4萬8千人投票啫」，此外沒有其他內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區解釋，戴指新西參與者認為要起碼有4萬8千人參與初選投票才會承認結果，若不夠票數就只作參考；但戴沒解釋新西和新東的相似性，亦沒有提及新西共識是採用「會運用」，區是直至6月19日參選人報名時夾附額外聲明，才首次知悉新西協議寫「會運用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱從政要求同存異找最大公因數-但初選後期似乎變成一派拉倒一派&quot;&gt;區稱從政要求同存異、找最大公因數 但初選後期「似乎變成一派拉倒一派」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，6月14日與時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻正煩惱九龍東「兵變」問題，最後只能被動接受，而戴就在群組表示同意，並補充新西都會提交額外聲明。區指，當時戴已曾開新西會議，「佢係知道佢哋會咁做架啦一早，而佢亦都知道，當用到『會運用』嘅時候，即使新界西嘅人同意都好，我唔會同意，其他區嘅人亦都有唔同嘅意見。」區並指，「以上嘅過程，我到而家都係後知後覺，我好難接受嗰過程，可以叫做民主。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，但民主有時也是一個「互相讓步（give and take）」的過程，實際上不認為能在某件事上達到一致的聲音，始終要做一個決定，即使不會令所有人滿意。區續指，「喺我從政唔同嘅階段裏面，一路話畀我聽，要求同存異，搵共識要搵最大公因數。但初選去到後期，似乎變成一派拉倒一派。而作為組織者，難道唔係要做一個中立仲裁嘅人咩？」陳慶偉表示明白，並指區的立場與戴可能有不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gddospG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（20日）踏入審訊第28天。區諾軒繼續接受代表何桂藍的大狀盤問，同意擔心候選人因表明否決預算案而被DQ，故「參選人應該小心言行」，惟2020年6月越來越多候選人作「政治表態」，他「感到好無奈」，認為若DQ會「白費好多人嘅心機」。對於戴耀廷主張政府不回應「五大訴求」才否決預算案，區認為視乎政府能否「釋出善意」，不過法官李運騰指政府有否「回應」是由議員而非35+組織者決定，因議員進入議會後組織者便很難控制他們。辯方同意，指本案謀劃是「空洞（hollow）」的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱無份草擬35計劃文件-惟呢份文件冇唔高興&quot;&gt;區稱無份草擬「35+計劃文件」 惟「呢份文件冇唔高興」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒繼續接受代表何桂藍的大狀 Trevor Beel 盤問。Beel 就取消候選資格（DQ）發問，被問到2020年1月的飯局有否談及DQ問題，區指「冇印象」，但表示自2016年開始，民主派參選立法會也有一定風險被取消資格，故爭取立會過半無可避免要預計有替補機制。區與戴耀廷其後在作為試點的九東協調會議提及此問題，頭兩次會議亦主力圍繞替補機制討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示「35+計劃」文件，區同意文件由戴耀廷準備，在九東首次會議上傳閱，文件上有提及替補機制。區同意，他與趙家賢均「冇份參與草擬」文件，於會議上才首次看到。Beel 問，區對戴沒有諮詢二人下就準備這份重要的文件，有否被激怒或生氣？區指「呢份文件冇唔高興」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱擔心候選人因表明否決財案被dq認為參選人應小心言行&quot;&gt;區稱擔心候選人因表明否決財案被DQ、認為參選人應小心言行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，區當時認為候選人被 DQ 的主要原因是什麼，會否認為情況沒完沒了（ad infinitum）。法官陳慶偉關注與案件的關係，及證人能否回答，法官李運騰改為問，組織者曾否想過即使有替補的人，也可能出於同樣原因被DQ。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區表示，最初大家包括他在內也是「心存樂觀」，因區議會選舉大部分民主派參選人也沒有被DQ。但到了大約6月開始，有輿論表示若表明妄顧後果地否決預算案，會被視為不尊重《基本法》、有被DQ風險，區指當時擔心若有候選人作相關言論會被DQ。Beel 指區議會和立法會的情況不同，但區認為兩者情況相近，並指「民主派亦都應該有汲取教訓」，因早在2016年已有本土派人士被DQ，故「參選人應該小心言行」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱對6月越來越多候選人作政治表態感無奈若被dq白費咗好多人心機&quot;&gt;區稱對6月越來越多候選人作政治表態感無奈：若被DQ白費咗好多人心機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，那區認為DQ的問題是否爭取立會過半無法移除的障礙？區指，初選參選人被DQ「係會令到民主派部署出現好大混亂」，「所以當6月份越嚟越多候選人去作出政治表態呢，我感到好無奈」，何桂藍一度「O嘴」。區並指「若果用咁多心機準備初選，到頭嚟候選人被取消資格，白費咗好多義工，好多人嘅心機」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，但據當時替補機制，若有人被DQ會有人替補，區同意。Beel 一度問，但替補者與被DQ者應有類似的立場？惟陳慶偉指問題沒有需要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱各區均決定辦公民投票指戴耀廷fb發文前從來唔會問我哋&quot;&gt;區稱各區均決定辦公民投票、指戴耀廷FB發文前「從來唔會問我哋」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後引戴耀廷3月的 Facebook 帖文，提及民主派討論立會奪半安排有三個可考慮方案，包括「初選」、「排名加棄選」及「棄選」。Beel 問，戴耀廷在發文前有沒有與他商討不同方案？區略激動道：「戴耀廷擺上 Facebook 之前從來唔會問我哋嘅」，鄒家成、施德來、柯耀林等多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區確認，沒有就帖文與戴耀廷討論，但文中三個方案都有在各區會議討論，而九東亦一度採用「棄選」，即不搞初選、只進行民意調查，若得不到足夠支持就公開宣布停止選舉工程。區並確認，各區雖有討論其他方案，但最後都決定辦初選，而最遲的九東也在5月4日的第三次會議決定辦初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問決定辦初選後是否所有人都得採用同一機制，區指各區是各自討論，但後來戴耀廷想統一公民投票系統，如香港島與會者一直提倡投4票，但到了5月19日的第三次會議，要「特登處理由4票轉為1票」，與會人士無奈接受。陳慶偉問為何說「無奈」，區解釋因投4票是由司馬文建議，香港島與會者亦很支持，但後期因投票程式緣故，「大家覺得之前傾咗嘅事情，冇辦法實現」，故只能無奈接受。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後問及，新界東會議對初選機制是否沒有達成共識？區指至少決定了辦初選及目標議席為6席，只是要否爭取第7席需待初選投票日後再討論。辯方問，但公民投票是否相較其他選項被戴耀廷重點提及？區指「我只能話佢推動呢件事情上冇阻力」，並只有九東一區最初指不搞公民投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意五大訴求曾改動要短期內達成係好困難&quot;&gt;區同意五大訴求曾改動、要短期內達成「係好困難」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後就五大訴求發問。區同意，五大訴求內容曾經改動，特別在政府於2019年10月撤回《逃犯條例》後。Beel 舉例，如特首下台的口號由爭取普選取代？區同意「曾經有過相類似變化」，Beel 再指各人對五大訴求理解不同，區指「要視乎佢講嘅五大訴求係邊五大訴求」。法官陳仲衡指，無論如何，要短期內達成五大訴求是幾乎不可能的，區答「係好困難」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，能否說若政府不回應五大訴求，才會考慮否決預算案？區答「如果你話戴耀廷嘅主張嘅話呢，可以咁樣推演」，李運騰問區是否指其他人可能有其他說法？區再笑說：「睇吓個當事人係主張乜嘢講法」，同意可從選舉論壇觀察。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指政府回應視乎能否釋出善意-官指有否回應非組織者決定&quot;&gt;區指政府回應視乎能否「釋出善意」 官指有否回應非組織者決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再問，區如何理解政府的「回應」？區指最基本是政府能否「釋出善意」。他舉例，五大訴求其中一個訴求是「撤回暴動定性」，他任立法會議員時曾與朱凱廸提出私人條例草案，修改香港暴動法例以跟從國際標準。區指當然就政府而言「係好難去接納嘅」，「但如果接納嘅，係唔係就已經係回應部分關於撤回暴動定性嘅訴求呢？」，又指當時提出草案後被不少人批評，「因為佢哋覺得我哋認同咗暴動呢個概念。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，故若政府就一至兩項訴求作討論，也算是回應的一種？區指「都係有回應」。李運騰續指區諾軒面對的困難，是到底政府有否作出回應、或回應是否足夠，是由議員、而非35+組織者決定（“… up to the legislators to decide, not up to the organisers of 35+.”），因為一旦議員進入議會，組織者便很難控制他們（have very little control over them）。Beel 同意，指謀劃就是「空洞（hollow）」的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒確認初選文件無提及政府停擺及林鄭下台&quot;&gt;區諾軒確認初選文件無提及政府停擺及林鄭下台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再問，區辦初選的目標是否從來不是讓政府停擺？區答「我冇講過要政府停擺」，Beel 續問，那初選組織者在口頭或文件上是否從沒提及想政府停擺？區表示「初選整體由記者會到文件，我所憶述，就冇整體講過一次要政府停擺」。區亦表示：「初選文件以及相關新聞稿，都冇提及要林鄭月娥特首下台。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件周三續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">區諾軒：民主派就財案一致投票僅為戴耀廷假設 非各人「共同願景」 區諾軒：戴耀廷處理初選「有唔民主嘅地方」 後期「似乎變成一派拉倒一派」 區諾軒對多名參選人「政治表態」感無奈、若被DQ會「白費好多人心機」</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Rise And Demise Of EU-China</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-20-rise-and-demise-of-eu-china.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rise And Demise Of EU-China" /><published>2023-03-20T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-03-20T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/rise-and-demise-of-eu-china</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-20-rise-and-demise-of-eu-china.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) proved short-lived. After 7 years of negotiations, only 5 months passed between its political agreement and the European Parliament voting to freeze its ratification in May 2021.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Despite its short tenure, the deal offers an ideal window into Germany’s evolving debate on China in the post-Merkel period. It would have deepened EU-China economic ties, and, as this brief shows, was not universally popular within Germany at the time — despite German chancellor Angela Merkel’s leadership in pushing it through to a conclusion and suggestions by some European states that the CAI privileged the interests of Volkswagen and other German manufacturers. Examining the landscape of reactions to the CAI within Germany, this brief uncovers the dynamics at play as Berlin reconciles its deep economic ties to China with Beijing’s increasing tendency to act in ways that contravene European economic and political interests and values. These dynamics suggest that risk assessments of China in Germany are evolving in an uneven and gradual way that will shape the aperture for transatlantic coordination on China in the near term. U.S. policymakers seeking to enhance opportunities for joint action on China should expand venues to deliberate Beijing’s behavior and take care to ensure that the three parts of their invest-align-compete approach to China are working in concert, and not at odds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-provisions-of-the-cai&quot;&gt;Key Provisions of the CAI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negotiations over the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) began in January 2014 and spanned 35 meetings across seven years. The CAI would have replaced the individual bilateral investment treaties (BITs) — which regulate how host states treat foreign investors hailing from the treaty partner — that most EU member states hold with China. Brussels sought a comprehensive BIT to secure greater access and more predictable conditions for European firms and rectify the low levels of European investment in China; while bilateral trade in goods and services had grown substantially, when CAI negotiations kicked off China only accounted for 2.1 percent of overseas EU foreign direct investment (FDI), “way below what could be expected from two of the most important economic blocks on the planet.” For their part, Chinese policymakers were cognizant of China’s growing role as a capital exporter and wanted to put regulatory mechanisms in place that would protect Chinese investment access abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of limited progress, negotiations proceeded particularly quickly in the final months of 2020 as Chinese president Xi Jinping personally intervened to offer market-access concessions and salvage the deal before a new U.S. administration more willing to work with allies and partners on China entered office. German chancellor Angela Merkel proved an eager partner in this eleventh-hour push, leveraging the final days of Germany’s EU presidency to secure an in-principle agreement. During the last days of December, Merkel jointly announced the deal with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European Council president Charles Michel, and Chinese president Xi Jinping. The CAI was put forth for ratification in the European Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement had a relatively short tenure in public debate. In March 2021, Beijing sanctioned 10 individuals and four entities within the European Union in retaliation for EU sanctions that same month targeting Chinese individuals and entities involved in the persecution and mass detention of Uighurs in Xinjiang. This tit-for-tat move was a turning point in European debate on China, leading to a steep rise in strategic mistrust in Brussels and many EU capitals. As EU representative for foreign and security policy Josep Borrell put it, Chinese retaliatory sanctions “created a new atmosphere . . . a new situation” in EU thinking toward China. The president of the European Chamber of Commerce (EUCC), Jörg Wuttke, observed a “mood shift” in Berlin by early 2021. This move also pivotally shaped the trajectory of the CAI. In May 2021, the European Parliament voted to suspend ratification while China’s sanctions remained in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the geopolitical context was an important part of the debate over the CAI within Germany (as the next section shows), China’s concessions to EU investors under the CAI also proved controversial. The text of the agreement was made public on January 22, 2021, and the specific market-access commitments were released on March 12, 2021. The CAI’s core provisions can be split into three categories: market access, a level playing field, and sustainable development. Several provisions within the annexes are also worth introducing since they were hotly debated during the ensuing discussion of the deal within Europe, particularly in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;market-access&quot;&gt;Market Access&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CAI followed a “positive list” approach, specifying areas of the Chinese economy open for European investment. For the most part, these were “almost entirely a confirmation of earlier openings by China, either under the aegis of the WTO [World Trade Organization], or through the successive issuance of several ‘negative lists’ for foreign investment,” while new market openings were limited. Arguably, the CAI “prevents backsliding” by binding China under the power of an international treaty to preserve existing openings for EU firms in the future. EU negotiators also pointed to the “ratchet clause” — which stipulated that any further opening China offered investors of other nations would automatically be extended to EU investors — as a win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;level-playing-field&quot;&gt;Level Playing Field&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section of the CAI was its most popular among European businesses and policymakers. China addressed several longstanding complaints by European businesses in China, agreeing to: ban forced technology transfer, mandate transparency over subsidies in services, require state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to act on commercial bases and not discriminate against foreign firms in their procurement and sales of goods and services, and grant EU firms access to China’s standards setting bodies. Some analysts were skeptical of such promises, given what they saw as China’s weak record of compliance with prior international commitments in some of these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sustainable-development&quot;&gt;Sustainable Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the CAI, the European Union secured commitments from China not to lower or fail to enforce certain environmental and labor standards to attract investment. Specifically, China agreed to renew efforts to combat climate change and implement its promises under the 2015 Paris Agreement, as well as to make “continued and sustained efforts” to ratify outstanding International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions (No. 29 and No. 105) banning forced labor. As of the start of 2020, Beijing had reportedly refused to make commitments in this realm. As a result, EU negotiators presented this commitment as a “very strong signal” of China’s intent to improve practices in the environmental and labor domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;special-provisions&quot;&gt;Special Provisions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two further provisions are worth noting since they featured extensively in the debate about the CAI within Germany. The first is a provision in the annexes, which largely enshrined existing restrictions on European NGOs, business chambers, and foundations in China; in it, China also reserved the right to demand that senior executives of foreign nonprofit organizations in China be Chinese citizens. The second provision restricted the rights of European law firms in China, specifying that they were required to entrust Chinese law firms to deal with Chinese legal affairs on behalf of foreign clients, rather than provide representation or advisory services to them directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;germany-reacts-to-the-cai-202021&quot;&gt;Germany Reacts to the CAI: 2020–21&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the CAI was announced, EU-China relations were in a far different state than they had been seven years earlier. Beijing was cracking down on democratic freedoms in Hong Kong through a series of new regulatory measures; the scale and nature of Chinese internment practices targeted at the Uyghur population in Xinjiang were coming to light; Chinese “wolf warrior” diplomats were causing a stir on social media and in many European capitals; and throughout 2020, as Covid-19 spread across the European continent, China benefited financially and ideologically by selling personal protective equipment (PPE) to Europe for a profit, spreading disinformation about the virus’s origins, and highlighting tragedies to suggest the West was in chaotic decay. Commenting on the CAI’s suspension in May 2021, European trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis noted, “We cannot ignore the wider context of relations between the EU and China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a month before the CAI was announced in principle, U.S. president Donald Trump, who had ruffled feathers in European capitals for his “America first” rhetoric, was voted out of office in favor of Joseph Biden, whose appointees immediately began communicating a desire to work with partners and allies to preserve the liberal international order from threats — chief among them China. The incoming administration made its hesitation to the CAI clear prior to inauguration day. Just eight days before the European Union and China announced the agreement, Biden’s incoming national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, implied reservations by sharing that the Biden team would “welcome early consultations with our European partners on our common concerns about China’s economic practices.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CAI was introduced at this nexus: amid transformative changes in China’s international and domestic policy behavior and amid renewed prospects for transatlantic relations represented by the new U.S. administration. As a result, debate about the CAI within Europe — and among national governments, industry associations, and European civil society more broadly — concerned both the substance of the deal and its timing. The following sections examine how political, business, and civil-society communities within Germany, Europe’s largest and most influential economy, reacted to the CAI, drawing on not only interviews with members of these communities but also statements by the major German political parties, key German business and industry associations, and German civil society organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-reactions&quot;&gt;Political Reactions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German political debate on China is driven by coalitional and interparty politics, industry and civil-society positioning, geopolitical developments, and China’s own foreign and domestic policy behavior. The approaches to the CAI within each major political party in part confirm that political debate on China is now broadly driven by what analyst Roderick Kefferpütz has described as a “tug of war” between those who favor Merkel’s longstanding, engagement-centered approach to China and those who prefer a more values-driven foreign policy. The two frameworks for China policy do not fundamentally disagree on the facts of the Sino-German relationship — for example, that China is an important trading partner and that its rising crackdowns at home and assertiveness abroad are concerning. But the two camps differ in how to engage China based on these facts. As parties, Alliance 90/The Greens (the Greens) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) tend more toward a “dialogue and toughness” approach, as German minister of foreign affairs Annalena Baerbock put it on the 2021 federal-election campaign trail. Within Germany’s historically largest parties, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) — allied with the Christian Social Union (CSU) in Bavaria — and the Social Democratic Party (SPD), there is more disagreement on the best course of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the following sections show, the reactions of these four major German political parties to the CAI highlight these dynamics. Mirroring the diversity of policy positions found among the major U.S. political parties, each party had members that were more supportive and less supportive of both the CAI and of reevaluating Germany’s approach to a changing China. Nevertheless, some trends are evident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fdp-and-greens-led-the-criticism&quot;&gt;FDP and Greens Led the Criticism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political attention to the CAI was limited when it was agreed in principle — perhaps because this was during the winter holiday period — but grew in early 2021 after the full text was made available and China imposed surprising, retaliatory sanctions. None of the major parties were opposed to the CAI outright, but the Greens and FDP argued against ratification in its agreed form. These parties viewed the timing with skepticism: The announcement came as a new U.S. administration eager to work with Europe on China-related trade and investment issues was entering office and arguably delivered Beijing a diplomatic win amid concerning foreign and domestic policy developments. Beyond this, especially as the text was released, both the Greens and FDP concluded that the CAI represented a missed opportunity to press for greater alignment with European values in China’s market orientation and human rights practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beyond this, especially as the text was released, both the Greens and FDP concluded that the CAI represented a missed opportunity to press for greater alignment with European values in China’s market orientation and human rights practices.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese countersanctions on European entities got the ball rolling on a coordinated FDP response, which in June resulted in Breathing New Life into the CAI: 12 Liberal Demands for a Politically Viable Investment Deal with China, written by Sandra Weeser, a member of the Economic Affairs and Energy Committee in charge of trade policy, and Gyde Jensen, an FDP colleague who was serving as chairwoman of the Committee on Human Rights and Humanitarian Aid. Within the FDP, Jensen and Weeser faced little internal pushback to their critiques. As one interviewee argued, this reflected an increasingly skeptical party stance on China, owing not only to the party’s transatlanticist tendencies and growing concern about China’s human rights behavior, but also its core electorate, which included small- and medium-sized “Mittlestand” companies wary of growing competition at home from Chinese industry. According to the interviewee, the inclusion of calls to expand other trade agreements — including the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada and the Free Trade Agreement between Mexico and the European Union — in the 12 Liberal Demands report reassured the most ideologically pro-free trade elements of the party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Greens did not produce a similarly formal, standalone set of demands for the CAI, quite a few members spoke out against the deal. Reinhard Bütikofer, a German Greens politician serving as a member of the European Parliament, immediately questioned its hasty conclusion and later drew attention to a wide range of deficits he saw in the text. Bütikofer was not alone in his criticism. However, it is worth noting that some Greens were less critical at the time. One interviewee pointed to prominent Green Party Bundestag member Jürgen Trittin as an exception in this regard. Trittin reportedly saw the timing as unproblematic in a transatlantic context because the United States had recently secured its own economic concessions from China. That said, even Trittin felt that this “window of opportunity” in EU-China relations had not been utilized to its full advantage and argued that certain provisions in the CAI were inadequate in light of recent developments in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon reviewing the CAI, the Greens and FDP primarily responded to its chapter on sustainable development. China’s commitment to “make continued and sustained efforts to pursue ratification” of ILO conventions on forced labor were seen as insufficient, especially in light of the clear violations of these conventions that had come to light in Xinjiang. In an April 2021 interview, then-candidate for chancellor Annalena Baerbock argued that in the CAI, “the European side has not adequately addressed the issue of forced labor in relation to the oppressed Uyghur minority.” Margarete Bause, then serving as spokeswoman for human rights and humanitarian aid for the Greens’ parliamentary group, called the CAI a “mistake” due to the human rights situation in China. FDP lawmakers involved in organizing the party’s response to the deal, including Jensen and Weeser, had been following developments in Hong Kong and Xinjiang for some time with concern. In commentary on the CAI, the Greens and FDP repeatedly suggested more could be done to address Beijing’s forced labor practices in Xinjiang. While demanding that the CAI’s sustainable-development section be strengthened, including by forcing China commit to ratifying the relevant ILO conventions within a fixed timeline, many politicians from these two parties also advocated for additional initiatives to address these practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside the sustainable-development provisions, the FDP and Greens largely saw China’s market-access and level-playing-field commitments as steps in the right direction but inadequate to justify ratification. Members of both parties critiqued the continued lack of reciprocity promised by the deal, expressed skepticism based on China’s track record of not observing WTO rules, and argued that level-playing-field provisions needed to be combined with robust investment protections to ensure an improved situation for European firms. Other concerns, expressed in the FDP’s 12 Liberal Demands, included the restrictions on NGOs in Annex II, Article 9, and the prohibition on foreign law firms practicing Chinese law, which enshrined what the FDP saw as overly restrictive Chinese laws in treaty form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cdu-and-spd-grand-coalition-support-with-individual-critiques&quot;&gt;CDU and SPD: Grand Coalition Support with Individual Critiques&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDU and SPD were more muted than the FDP and Greens when it came to China during the 2021 federal-election campaign, which kicked off early that year when the CAI was still in play. This is reflected in party election manifestos: China was mentioned 22 times in the FDP manifesto and 16 times in the Greens’, while the CDU/CSU mentioned the country only seven times and the SPD only four. Nevertheless, trends can be distilled from individual lawmaker statements about the CAI and party statements on China in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Merkel’s leadership, the CDU supported the deal throughout the final year of her chancellorship. Despite individual criticisms regarding timing and substance, the CDU/CSU parliamentary group released an endorsement statement wherein Deputy Chairwoman Katja Leikert cited “worrying” developments in the human-rights situation in China but dismissed suggestions that the CAI should be leveraged to force meaningful improvements. Leikert argued it would be “naïve” to expect an investment agreement to “bring about a system change in China” and that Chinese commitments of any variety on this front “must be seen as the positive intermediate steps that they are.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chancellery and top CDU ministers took steps to boost support for the CAI within Germany. Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Peter Altmaier, a member of Merkel’s cabinet, immediately lauded the CAI as a “trade policy milestone” promising greater market access, legal certainty, and a better competitive environment in China. Merkel’s public defense of the deal was arguably limited, but she did attempt to drum up support in more targeted settings. In a speech to CDU/CSU lawmakers in May 2021, just after European trade commissioner Dombrovskis announced he would no longer actively pursue ratification, Merkel argued that despite human-rights concerns vis-à-vis China, the CAI remained a “very important undertaking” promising German companies more reciprocity in terms of market access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflective of the party today, some CDU members expressed reservations with the deal’s timing and what they saw as an inappropriate continuation of Germany’s business-first paradigm. In the CAI debate, individual CDU lawmakers questioned whether China would actually address forced labor, a key concern of the FDP and Greens. Norbert Röttgen, a CDU politician who had led the push against Huawei’s role in Germany’s fifth-generation (5G) wireless infrastructure in 2019, expressed alarm from his vantage point as chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the Bundestag that allowing the CAI to proceed as is, with China merely committing to “efforts” to ratify the ILO conventions on forced labor, would be akin to concluding an agreement in which “forced labor is implicitly accepted.” Nevertheless, there was no organized opposition to the deal within the CDU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the CDU’s governing coalition at the time, the SPD did not oppose the CAI upon its in-principle agreement. Some in the SPD were seeking to distance the party from Merkel’s business-first approach to China, while maintaining dialogue and engagement at the center of its approach. Germany’s muted reaction to Beijing’s draconian crackdown in Hong Kong was an important turning point for this group. In the wake of events in Hong Kong, Nils Schmid, the SPD’s spokesperson on the Committee on Foreign Affairs and who had played a role in Germany’s 5G debate, critiqued Merkel’s China approach for being “out of date” and argued it was time to retire the idea that “as we deepen our economic ties with China, it will become more liberal.” Spearheaded by Schmid, together with prominent SPD politicians Metin Hakverdi and Christoph Matschie, in June 2020 the SPD parliamentary group released a position paper on China calling for a tougher stance. While endorsing the European Union’s three-part approach to China as a partner, competitor, and systemic rival, the authors argued that systemic rivalry should condition both partnership and competition, rather than having Germany approach China as “a partner on Monday, competitor on Tuesday, rival on Wednesday.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, some wings of the SPD favored continuing a pro-engagement approach akin to Merkel’s, which had historically been the party’s stance. On the 2021 campaign trail, SPD candidate (now chancellor) Olaf Scholz — who had a track record of promoting trade and investment with China during his years as minister of finance and mayor of Hamburg — arguably downplayed the need for a departure from past policy. As members of a historically pro-labor party, many SPD politicians were particularly conscious of the employment and profit opportunities tied to trade and investment with China. For example, one interviewee pointed to the fact that SPD stronghold Lower Saxony holds an ownership stake in Volkswagen, which employs nearly 300,000 Germans and remains heavily invested in China. The SPD’s 2021 federal election platform signaled the perceived importance of continuing to “conduct dialogue with China on cooperation and competition in a . . . constructive and critical manner.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SPD did not issue a formal party position on the CAI. Its lack of organized opposition arguably reflects the diversity of views about China and the deal among its members but also suggests cautious but lingering optimism about deepened trade and investment ties with China despite geopolitical developments — in alignment with the CDU, its coalition partner at the time. Individual lawmaker statements support this conclusion. Even while expressing concern that China’s behavior was running antithetical to CAI promises, SPD member and chair of the European Parliament’s Committee on International Trade Bernd Lange argued that “a trade and investment agreement offers the possibility of dialogue and the gradual change of facts.” In an interview in September 2021 on what German trade policy toward China should look like, Bernd Westphal (the economic and energy policy spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group) did not mention the then-frozen CAI but did emphasize that the SPD sees “China as an important trading partner” and that Germany should focus its efforts on “integrating China into the rules-based world trade system.” Revealingly, FDP and Greens representatives answered the same question by discussing the various barriers they felt needed to be addressed before the CAI could even be reconsidered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;business-community&quot;&gt;Business Community&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expectations for the CAI among German industry had been high. Even the China-invested companies most in favor of continued engagement and fearful of Chinese retaliatory behavior supported calls by the federal government and business associations for greater reciprocity and a more level playing field in China for European and Chinese companies. While they had long advocated for better operational conditions for their firms in China, major German associations such as the Federation of German Industries (BDI) and Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry (DIHK) intensified this push as Chinese firms began leveraging European economic openness to sell and invest within the European Union — and as Beijing launched industrial policy plans such as Made in China 2025, which sought global leadership in fields of German economic advantage. Accordingly, while encouraging progress in CAI negotiations, German industry associations cautioned European negotiators that quality would be as important as speed; as the DIHK put it, any agreement would require an “ambitious offer by China,” leveling the playing field and reducing market asymmetries, to be meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By these metrics, German business associations found the CAI underwhelming. Despite calls for substance, “in the end, it was only speed,” as BDI executive board member Wolfgang Niedermark put it in April 2021. Few German firms found major “wins” to point to, especially in market access, a member of the business community shared. Market-access deliverables fell short of true reciprocity — and in many cases duplicated existing openings, primarily serving to “legally safeguard . . . access to market areas where liberalization has been under way for quite some time.” German business associations noted that longstanding complaints of their members in China had gone entirely unaddressed in the CAI, including in the fields of government procurement, intellectual property protection, and cross-border data transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This did not prevent the community from officially supporting the CAI. Business associations saw the deal as an important, if marginal, symbolic move toward improving investment planning and security. The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) called the CAI an “important step . . . in a process toward ever-improving framework conditions for fair competition” in China and felt it “must be ratified as quickly as possible.” The Chemicals Industry Association (VCI) “[welcomed] the agreement.” The Machinery and Equipment Manufacturers Association (VDMA) called the CAI a “bird in the hand” whose provisions represented a “first step in the right direction.” As a BDI representative put it in April 2021, “It’s all a piece on our way to have rule-based cooperation between China and us. And we are not enthusiastic, but we think it is a good thing to have such an agreement.” Another member of the German business community held that despite its deficits, the CAI was “one part in an overall strategy that moves us forward in a certain direction.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, German industry largely welcomed its core provisions as a step forward, while acknowledging they were just that: a step that would need to be combined with others to level the playing field for European firms in China. Almost immediately, the attention of these major business associations vis-à-vis the CAI turned to how to achieve additional business community objectives following its as-is ratification. Friedolin Strack of the BDI, for example, argued in April 2021 that a “CAI phase two” would be necessary: “We have reached a certain step, but we need more steps. We should make clear at every occasion (and we in BDI try to do that) . . . that we do not leave China in this position of feeling comfortable in this role of a Party-driven economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to its perceived deficits, when the CAI was frozen due to tit-for-tat sanctions in spring 2021, the German business community did not see this as a big loss or organize to lobby against the freeze. On balance, Chinese concessions were not seen as substantial, and businesses largely remained interested in the Chinese market with or without an EU-China investment agreement in place. As BDI’s Niedermark put it after China sanctioned EU officials, a failure of the CAI would “not mean that we have to stop our engagement or could not even invest more in China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;civil-society&quot;&gt;Civil Society&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German civil society — including NGOs, foundations, and think tanks — meaningfully entered the national debate on the CAI after March 2021, once the full text was published and China implemented retaliatory sanctions on EU entities. This group was in some ways the most outspoken in its criticism of the deal. Civil-society actors had not been extensively engaged during negotiations; although the directorate-general for Trade at the European Commission had convened “civil society dialogues” beginning in 2017, these reportedly “served primarily as a communication tool and mostly attracted business representatives.” As a result, the initial reaction was one of surprise at the NGO provision. As Bertram Lang, a researcher at Goethe University with expertise on civil-society issues in China, shared, “When the Annexes were published . . . there was mostly astonishment, because NGOs didn’t really have the CAI on the radar.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprise among civil society was soon accompanied by criticism, even if some groups expressed this cautiously and privately. As Tagesschau reported, German political foundations — many of which had offices in China — found the annex’s NGO provision “irritating” and “threatening,” a symbol that this community was not seen as important enough to be included in negotiations. But they were also immediately concerned about implications for their operations within China. As Lang shared in an interview, foundations reacted strongly to this provision partially because “they read it as if the next day, they would have to appoint a [Chinese] senior executive” to lead their operations in China in order comply with Chinese law. As noted above, the NGO provision would also affect businesses and industry associations such as the BDI, and this helped fuel media attention to the issue within Germany in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Surprise among civil society was soon accompanied by criticism, even if some groups expressed this cautiously and privately.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think tanks also drove criticism of the deal. For example, while seeing the market access and level-playing-field provisions as positive developments, Mikko Huotari and Max Zenglein of the influential German think tank, the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS), argued that the “(geo)political context and what’s not in the agreement” meant that it was not “the deal the European side had hoped for when negotiations started seven years ago.” On the eve of the CAI’s in-principle agreement, a group of 14 EU-China experts at German and other European think tanks and research organizations suggested that concluding the CAI at the end of 2020 would symbolically endorse Beijing’s political trajectory after a year of shocking developments in its international and domestic policy and that “Europe will thus lose leverage not only on issues critical for its future competitiveness but also on fundamental value issues.” Noah Barkin, managing editor at the Rhodium Group and a visiting senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, shared in an interview that criticism grew over time, particularly after China imposed sanctions on European entities, including MERICS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-window-into-evolving-german-debate-on-china&quot;&gt;A Window into Evolving German Debate on China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing remains interested in the CAI, particularly as support for stricter investment screening grows in many European capitals. The most immediate hurdles to the agreement are China’s sanctions and implementation of the ILO conventions, as attention in Europe has grown substantially over the past year toward Beijing’s human- rights practices. These hurdles to the CAI will be difficult to overcome as promise fatigue grows in European capitals. China’s commitments to uphold international economic norms or respect European values and interests are increasingly viewed with skepticism — a trend accelerated by Beijing’s tacit support for Russia during the Ukraine war despite its stated support for sovereignty and territorial integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;These hurdles to the CAI will be difficult to overcome as promise fatigue grows in European capitals.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dynamic is evident in how European leaders have reacted to China’s more recent efforts at signaling commitment to CAI ratification. In meetings with sanctioned EU organizations and individuals in fall 2022, Beijing reportedly communicated that outstanding restrictions would not be strictly enforced. Reflective of the wide range of concerns with China and the CAI, however, this did little to move the needle. Furthermore, although Beijing announced in April 2022 that it would ratify ILO conventions 29 and 105, arguably following through on its promises to make “efforts” toward ratification, many European policymakers did not see this as a gamechanger. Ongoing concerns about China’s human-rights practices, as well as an overall sense of skepticism regarding promises from Beijing, had taken hold in many corners of the German and European parliaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a bilateral investment deal between Europe and China looks unlikely as of 2023, the Biden administration will be seeking to maximize transatlantic coordination in the years ahead as U.S. strategic competition with China accelerates. The CAI’s trajectory uncovers several realities about the dynamics of German debate on China that U.S. policymakers would do well to keep in mind going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, the primary determinant of German sentiment on China will be Beijing’s actions.&lt;/strong&gt; Souring German (and European) sentiment toward China is not the result of U.S. pressure, despite Chinese assessments to the contrary. The key driver is the trajectory of a changing China. China’s ratification of ILO conventions in 2022 did little to convince European policymakers that Beijing was newly committed to improving its human rights practices, for example, because its policies in Xinjiang were telling another story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, pull factors remain strong for many German enterprises in China, preserving a pro-engagement voice in the national debate.&lt;/strong&gt; Today, while German companies are wary of a growing set of risks to their business operations in China and increasingly exploring options for diversification, they remain interested in China as a production site, source of innovation, and market. Larger German firms (and their top suppliers) with meaningful China exposure continue to invest heavily in the country. Many German firms are adapting to growing geopolitical tensions by localizing staff, supply chains, and data flows and taking advantage of local research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and partnerships with Chinese firms to tailor their products and services. A representative of one business association observed that while the field itself may be shifting and becoming less level, given rising Party-state intervention in shepherding economic resources toward strategic ends, “there is still a lot of political and economic will to . . . play on that playing field” among German companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These pull factors explain why China-invested German corporate heavyweights recently “butted heads” with the Greens-controlled Foreign Office and Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action over government missives to diversify away from China and an intensified emphasis on systemic rivalry in some corners of the Traffic Light Coalition, which they see as risking retaliation from Beijing and jeopardizing profits in China. It also suggests that this pro-engagement lobby will remain a player in German debate on China going forward. The fault line within the German business community on this topic, several members of this community suggested, may increasingly be between those companies with a China presence and those without, as investing in China is becoming harder due to German government pressures, market competition, and a changing Chinese regulatory environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nevertheless, and third, support is widespread among German businesses (and government officials) for an enhanced EU and transatlantic toolbox of defensive measures designed to level the playing field and bring China more in line with the multilateral rules-based system.&lt;/strong&gt; German industry felt the CAI failed to secure comprehensive improvements in these areas, and associations called for additional instruments to level the playing field, such as stronger European investment screening and anti–foreign subsidy measures. As a representative of German business put it, “We’re all in heavy favor of sharpening our tools because . . . it’s a much better diplomatic deterrent and a clearer way of working together.” Another representative held that supranational tools were widely supported given prioritization on improving reciprocity and leveling the playing field: “China reacts to strength.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-takeaways-for-transatlantic-cooperation-on-china&quot;&gt;Recommendations: Takeaways for Transatlantic Cooperation on China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration would do well to recognize these realities as it seeks to enhance transatlantic cooperation on China in the years ahead. Cooperation should be approached incrementally, with recognition that while risk assessments of China in the European Union’s largest member state are evolving, they are doing so in an uneven and gradual way, with significant disagreement over the speed and scale of policy change. Some of the largest businesses remain ambivalent about national directives that push the country toward targeted economic and technological decoupling from China, such as Germany’s recent supply chain due-diligence law and proposals to eliminate government investment guarantees and screen outbound investment. And as negotiations over Germany’s China strategy clarify, differences remain between and within the major German political parties regarding adjustments to policy toward Beijing. These realities do not mean German policymakers are inattentive to the risks associated with a changing China but — as in any democracy — will create pressures on political parties and lawmakers that may naturally condition the scope and speed of policy response to these risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional channels for U.S.-EU consultation about China’s foreign and domestic policy developments and the risks they pose are needed.&lt;/strong&gt; From the perspective of the European Union, worrisome trends include but are not limited to the following: China’s tacit support for Russia in the war in Ukraine; expanding influence in international organizations, including those intended to protect and preserve human rights; military assertiveness across the Taiwan Strait, a key maritime trading route; economic coercion against both European states and its neighbors in the Indo-Pacific; efforts to export Chinese policing and security practices to authoritarian regimes; and influence operations in Europe — all of which overlap with U.S. concerns about China’s rise. The number of substantive venues for regular dialogue on China have increased under the Biden administration. For example, the EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council first met in September 2021. The high-level EU-U.S. Dialogue on China was launched in May 2021 and the now meets regularly. More frequent government exchanges on China, as well as regularized Track 1.5 and Track 2 dialogues, could serve as an additional basis for sharing information about the Chinese actions and initiatives that are most destabilizing, determining which can be jointly addressed most feasibly, and developing effective policy approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The overall health and stability of the transatlantic relationship will be vital for coordination on China, so care should be taken to anticipate and address spillover effects from the U.S. “invest-align-compete” approach to China.&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. policymakers need to ensure that the “invest” and “compete” components of this three-part framework are not working at odds with its desire to deepen alignment with key partners and allies. Recent U.S. export controls on China, as well as the Inflation Reduction Act, triggered frictions with Europe not only because they affect the economic prospects of European firms, but also because they were reportedly carried out with insufficient consultation and communication about these consequences. Putting the merit of individual policies aside, ensuring regular attention to implications for broader transatlantic ties in U.S. economic and technology policymaking — especially as this becomes a more important part of U.S.-China strategic competition — will preserve the goodwill needed for further coordination on China down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;區諾軒改稱不希望使用「騎劫」字眼 「結果又傷害戴耀廷」&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;區諾軒：「攬炒十步」是戴耀廷狂想、Final Fantasy 多名被告大笑&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;辯方指民主派奪半或被DQ拘捕 區諾軒引張炳良書指「民主路要談判先有機會」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ozE86dN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（17日）踏入審訊第27天。辯方昨展示戴耀廷發出的新界東協調文件，區諾軒指不知悉亦不同意使用「會運用」否決權字眼，在盤問下認感覺被戴「騎劫」。區今主動表示，「我諗過我覺得唔應該用『騎劫』呢個字眼去定性呢件事，始終唔想再用呢類詞語，結果又傷害戴耀廷」，指文件和自己過往兩年認知「存在落差」、自己如「蒙在鼓裏」，並直言報名表列明須認同他及戴主導之協調會議共識，「我終歸難免有把關嘅責任。」辯方又引 WhatsApp 紀錄，顯示新東文件曾於2020年4及5月以廣播功能發出，惟區承認不在廣播名單亦沒有收到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;昨認感被戴耀廷騎劫-區諾軒今改稱不想用該字眼傷害戴耀廷&quot;&gt;昨認感被戴耀廷「騎劫」 區諾軒今改稱不想用該字眼傷害戴耀廷&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒繼續接受代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉盤問。辯方昨於庭上展示戴耀廷2020年6月8日在組織者群組發出的「35+新東final」文件，以「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新界東協調機制協議」為題，列明「會運用」權力否決預算案，區承認昨才得悉字眼非「會積極運用」，會上亦有質疑否決預算案的聲音。被問戴耀廷是否「騎劫」反對意見，區表示「確實係有呢個感覺」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉今再指，區當時沒有開過檔案，因為若有開，他並不會同意當中字眼，亦會有所行動。區同意，並主動補充：「噚日辯方律師問我有冇一個騎劫嘅感覺，我諗過我覺得唔應該用騎劫呢個字眼去定性呢件事。始終唔想再用呢類詞語，結果又傷害戴耀廷」，陳志全和何桂藍等微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區認新東文件會運用字眼與過往兩年認知有落差認蒙在鼓裏&quot;&gt;區認新東文件「會運用」字眼與過往兩年認知有落差、認「蒙在鼓裏」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，「但係我認知當時嘅情況係，若果呢份文件係當時候係咁樣寫，確實同我認知協調會議中與會者的意見，存在落差」，並指想大家留意「報名表始終有一句係咁寫嘅，『參與者須要認同由戴耀廷和區諾軒主導的協調會議共識』，我終歸難免有把關嘅責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問，區是否不知道為何文件會寫「會運用」？區指當文件昨天出現在他面前，「甚至可以講，同我過往兩年幾對件事嘅認知，存在落差。」李問會否可能是初稿或草稿，區指若是初稿，應會有「（初稿）」字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後問，就「騎劫」的答案，區諾軒是否昨晚回去認真想過，再答一個更好的版本，區同意。馬指他較關注區當時的感想，問區案發時是否的確有「被騎劫」的感覺。法官李運騰指區當時不知情，如何能有相關感受；陳仲衡亦指，「騎劫」一詞是由馬維騉提出，並非由證人自己說出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指：「可能我回應得唔好啦，因為我唔知道個稿件原來寫『會運用』，我冇理由喺當時會出現一個被騎劫或者任何負面嘅感覺，我只能形容當時嘅情況我係蒙在鼓裏。」李運騰問區說「蒙在鼓裏」是什麼意思，區解釋即當時新東協議最後採用「會運用」，而他並不知道。馬維騉一度指，原意今天完成盤問，但如區在周末再有其他進一步想法並在下周補充，或要再盤問他，惟法官陳慶偉即說「no」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;35新東及35新東final分別於4及5月已發出-區均不知情&quot;&gt;「35+新東」及「35+新東final」分別於4及5月已發出 區均不知情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續就戴耀廷和趙家賢的 WhatsApp 訊息發問，顯示「35+新東final」的文件曾於5月7日發出，但訊息發出者為一串數字及「@broadcast」的字眼，亦沒有顯示接收者。法官問及意思，控方解釋是 WhatsApp 廣播功能，該數字是從廣播名單而來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續問，不論發布者是誰，「35+新東final」文件是否於5月7日已存在，而區並不知道，區答「真的不知道」，且直至拘捕前都不知道。區亦確認，「35+新東final」的文件，確實沒有在包含所有新東參與者、他亦是成員的「35+計劃新東訊息發布區」中發布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後再次提及戴耀廷和趙家賢的 WhatsApp 紀錄，問區是否並非廣播名單內，區指「我真係冇印象我係喺呢個廣播群組裡面」。李再引該紀錄，顯示名為「35+新東」的文件於4月16日由某人以廣播發出，即首次新東會議的兩日後，亦沒有顯示接收者，區指他沒有收過該檔案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區認沒收到有關新西會議廣播訊息我諗大家都覺得想當然我係知道&quot;&gt;區認沒收到有關新西會議廣播訊息：我諗大家都覺得想當然我係知道&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒並主動提及該紀錄另一條訊息，有關新西協調會議將在5月8日於石景澄、林廷衞議員聯合辦事處舉行。區略激動指：「我就肯定100個 percent 係冇收過（該訊息），我由案發去到今時今日，我呢一刻先知道元朗安寧路世宙3號地舖原來係石景澄林廷衞議員辦事處」，並指「我一路以為係張可森議員辦事處」。李運騰指，法庭不清楚該資訊是否正確，區同意，但強調「如果呢個訊息我有收過，我就會聯繫到呢個地址同呢兩位議員嘅名」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指區稱他沒有出席過任何新西會議。區答「係啊，但我作為初選嘅主要協調人，我可以好肯定同法庭講，新界西嘅開會通知，呢一個訊息，我係冇收過」，說時並苦笑。陳慶偉續問區作為組織者，有否特別原因沒有收到該些訊息，區先指因他不在廣播群組內，陳再追問區不獲告知是因為溝通錯誤、分工、抑或其他原因？區再略激動苦笑：「我諗大家都覺得想當然我係知道囉，我而家真係真感情，我蒙在鼓裏。」彭卓棋、施德來等發笑，有被告笑着重複：「真感情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指據分工主力負責港島-唔係好關心新界西&quot;&gt;區指據分工主力負責港島 「唔係好關心新界西」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區確認，新西會議的時間地點均不是他決定，而他沒有出席新西會議是因「唔係好關心新界西」，指他當時主力負責香港島，「我的確冇辦法出席所有協調會議。」陳仲衡問他有否向戴耀廷及趙家賢表達他沒興趣，區指沒有，「但係根據當時分工，我知道自己嘅責任係要搞好香港島嘅協調會議」，他事前亦知道戴耀廷會出席新西會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，法官李運騰庭上亦有向區諾軒展示不同文件，就「民主派九龍西協調機制（初稿）」，區記得戴耀廷在首次九西會議後傳予他；至於「民主派九龍西協調機制協議」，他指沒有「初稿」字眼，理解為「終定本」，並指很大機會在戴耀廷6月8日發出時看過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「民主派新界西協調機制協議」，區指很有信心6月8日戴耀廷傳送時沒開過檔案，因他是在報名期才知道新西使用「會運用」字眼。李其後再將「民主派新西協調機制（初稿）」及「民主派新界西協調機制協議」一同展示，區直言「真係未見過」該份初稿，「我又係第一次見。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（17日）踏入審訊第27天。區諾軒繼續接受代表陳志全的大狀盤問，區同意戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉一文是對未來的「預測」，又指是戴的「狂想」，因屬「好唔現實嘅預測」。法官問是否戴的「藍圖」，又指戴認為該十步是「香港宿命」，區則指認為是「final fantasy（最終幻想）」，多名被告大笑。區又認同，文章最後提及香港社會停頓、血腥鎮壓等，「的確係講到好末日預言」，並重申不支持戴的推測，包括第一步的大規模DQ，自言他因有人被DQ才能當選立會議員，「我一直都相信，唔應該有呢啲事情發生。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方就多篇戴耀廷文章發問-指立會過半可與政權討價還價提及望特首下台&quot;&gt;辯方就多篇戴耀廷文章發問 指立會過半可與政權討價還價、提及望特首下台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒繼續接受代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉盤問。馬就多篇戴耀廷的文章發問，其中2020年3月3日在《蘋果日報》的〈反制警察政權就要立會奪半〉，區同意戴表示若反對陣營在立會奪半，可以否決預算案來與特區政權討價還價。法官李運騰問總結戴耀廷說法有何用意，馬指是嘗試顯示戴耀廷的想法如法官陳慶偉所言有「演進（evolvement）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指辯方應展示戴耀廷在 Facebook 分享，由「攬炒藝術家」於《立場新聞》發布的〈9%乃林鄭倒台關鍵〉，區指是第一次看到該文章，但按字面知道有想林鄭倒台的意思，並指戴到了3月31日的〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉一文才提及最終目標要特首下台。李問案發期間戴耀廷有否顯示想林鄭下台，區答「佢有提及過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴文章提齊上齊落-區指實際做不到協調機制有分歧&quot;&gt;戴文章提「齊上齊落」 區指實際做不到、協調機制有分歧&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後展示戴於3月10日在《蘋果日報》發表的〈齊上齊落 目標35+〉，區認為標題公允反映戴的看法，但「實質嘅情況我就唔覺得做到齊上齊落啦」。他引述文章指「這是一個有公民參與的協調機制。在這大原則下，細節仍有待確定」，指戴期望機制可行，但實際上未確定細節。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他又引戴指「若參選的人及團體不參與協調或不按協調的承諾行事，選民不積極參與兩個階段的公民參與程序，這艱巨的目標都難以達到」，指雖戴望達成此艱巨目標，但實際上當時「我哋都見到協調機制發展係有分歧嘅」。法官陳仲衡指，戴提及立會過半，民主派可「達到一個里程碑，有了新的根據點可向下一個里程碑邁進」，但沒提是什麼里程碑。區指的確沒清楚說明，但該句首提及「真普選的路途還遠」，真普選亦是五大訴求之一。區亦確認，該文章沒有用到「大殺傷力憲制武器」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬其後展示3月31日的〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉，提到戴形容選票是「武器」，指他在2013年提出公民抗命是「大殺傷力武器」，又指若反對派立會過半，會成為「大殺傷力憲制武器」，區確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方就真攬炒十步發問-區同意為戴耀廷預測&quot;&gt;辯方就〈真攬炒十步〉發問 區同意為戴耀廷預測&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後引4月28日〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉一文，戴提及「按我的推算，這條香港攬炒宿命路的時間線可能是這樣」，並列出十步。區諾軒同意，戴是「講緊一啲可能，而呢啲可能係未發生嘅」，亦是對未來事件的預測（prediction）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續就該十步發問，其中第一步於2020年7至8月發生：「政府廣泛取消民主派人士參選立法會資格，包括現任議員。民主派由 Plan B 繼續參選」，區同意戴預料在提名期有大規模取消資格，並在法官詢問下同意「Plan B」是之前提及的替補機制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第三步在10月發生：「特首及律政司開展司法程序DQ民主派議員，但因法庭需時處理，故民主派繼續主導立法會」，區同意戴預測9月選舉進行後會有議員被DQ，而司法程序是指司法覆核，「例如話你宣誓唔夠真誠」。法官陳仲衡指認為重點是民主派在DQ後仍主導立會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問攬炒十步是否戴耀廷藍圖-區形容為最終幻想六步已經太遠&quot;&gt;官問「攬炒十步」是否戴耀廷「藍圖」 區形容為「最終幻想」、六步已經太遠&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第四步及五步提及否決所有政府撥款申請和財政預算案，特首解散立法會；第六步則指：「立法會重選，民主派或要派出Plan C參選，因Plan B也可能被DQ，但仍取得35席以上」。馬維騉指，明顯這是戴的「癡心妄想（wishful thinking）」，惟李指區不能對此評論，陳慶偉亦指辯方起初已指出這只是戴的預測。法官陳仲衡問，但在本案而言，參選者是否不可能達到第六步，因最多只有 Plan B。區指有參選人預備 Plan B，「但講 Plan C 真係太遠啦。其實呢六步都已經太遠啦，有咁多前設。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指辯方並非問及是否可行，並改問區會否同意這是戴的「藍圖（blueprint）」或「預測（prediction）」。區答「我會話係佢嘅狂想」，鄒家成、何桂藍等多人發笑。李運騰問即使是狂想，但也是戴很希望實現（very much desired）的？區回應：「我點解會咁講，係因為係啲好唔現實嘅預測囉」，林卓廷重複說「預測囉」，鄒家成和吳政亨亦交談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續問，是否即是戴耀廷的「幻想（fantasy）」？法官陳慶偉指，對馬而言是「幻想」，但對戴耀廷而言是「香港宿命」，正如文章標題。李運騰亦補充戴認為是香港的最終宿命。區再說：「對我嚟講，我真係覺得呢個係狂想，所以係 fantasy」，隔了一會再說：「Final fantasy（最終幻想）」，即引來多名被告笑出聲，余慧明掩嘴大笑。李運騰指，認為區已不能再就戴的想法有再進一步回應，除非戴有跟他直接說，否則區的估計不會比我們好多少（“His guess is as good as ours.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區認戴耀廷攬炒十步如末日預言不支持其推測&quot;&gt;區認戴耀廷攬炒十步如末日預言、不支持其推測&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後問及第八至十步，提及大舉拘押民主派領袖，街頭抗爭更激烈，出現血腥鎮壓、發起三罷令社會陷入停頓，西方終對中共實行制裁。馬問，是否如聖經《啟示錄》中的「末日（apocalypse）」，並笑言只是比喻，而不是實際上的世界末日。區諾軒指戴有提及街頭抗爭很激烈、令香港社會陷入停頓，「的確係講到好末日預言。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續同意馬指，他並不希望攬炒十步在港發生。馬續問，是否連第一步大規模DQ也不想？區凝重答：「我係一個因為人哋被取消資格而當選嘅立法會議員，我一直都相信，唔應該有呢啲事情發生」，何桂藍發笑。馬問，故戴是否不支持任何一步在港發生，法官陳慶偉更改問題為區並不支持戴耀廷的預計或幻想？區答「我並不支持其十步推測」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷指攬炒可指特首辭職政府停擺中共宣布一國兩制結束&quot;&gt;戴耀廷指攬炒可指特首辭職、政府停擺、中共宣布一國兩制結束&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後指，該文不是戴首次提及「攬炒」，續要求展示4月14日的文章〈攬炒的定義和時間〉。文中戴指「攬炒的定義，可以是指立法會被解散和特首辭職，也可以是指特區政府運作停擺，亦可以是指中共正式宣佈一國兩制結束」，區確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，戴在文中問立會過半能否帶來上述後果，之後並回答該問題，提及全國人大可釋法讓中央政府解散立法會及成立臨時立法會，防止政府停擺，「一旦中共這樣做，那是實質宣佈一國兩制結束，也會產生攬炒結果。」李並指，戴其後提及攬炒的時間，指民主派在約一年間需兩次取得立法會過半議席，才能做到攬炒，而「除非中共肯讓步，不然它是難以阻止攬炒，只是攬炒不會即時發生，很大可能是在2021年底才爆發」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續問，那是戴的幻想抑或預測？區指文中與戴後來攬炒十部曲發生的步驟「都係相近嘅」，並在馬維騉詢問下確認，攬炒至少有上文所述3個意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/O2QpAGu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（17日）踏入審訊第27天。區諾軒繼續接受盤問，辯方指民主派取得立會過半後或令政府寸步難行，而政府有兩種「解決方法」，包括與民主派磋商，或以拘捕和DQ等方法「將多數變為少數」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方就政改方案發問，區主動引述前香港運輸及房屋局局長張炳良著書，指政改需獲特首同意、立會三分之二議員支持及更重要的中央政府同意。法官李運騰問是否令「五大訴求 缺一不可」更難實現，區指因此「睇咗咁多嘢、反思咗咁耐，我都係覺得香港嘅民主路係要透過談判，大家一齊傾，凝聚社會共識，大家先至有機會」，有被告聞言嘆氣。此外，被問到陳志全案發時有否「鬥黃」，區指陳有現任議員優勢，「我會話佢無誘因鬥黃。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指據往績陳志全非支持攬炒一派-但稱就本案不望主觀評論被告&quot;&gt;區指據往績陳志全非支持攬炒一派 但稱就本案不望主觀評論被告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒繼續接受代表陳志全的大狀馬維騉盤問。區曾受訪提及參選人對「35+」有兩種想像，一是透過議會過半提高民主派議價能力爭五大訴求，另一種是不惜攬炒和否決預算案向北京施壓。馬問陳志全是否不支持攬炒的一派？區指「我如果公允啲去講呢，往績嚟講，我係會咁歸納嘅」，但指始終本案談及案發期間各人行動，「所以我唔希望我自己用主觀嘅評論，去評論每一個被告。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指陳志全為現任議員-無誘因鬥黃無印象言行比過往激進&quot;&gt;區指陳志全為現任議員 無誘因「鬥黃」、無印象言行比過往激進&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續就「鬥黃」發問，區曾同意該詞指人們試圖表現得越激進越好。馬問比起「鬥黃」所指的鬥爭，形容比賽的「比黃」是否更合適，區指若放在選舉競爭，「黃」指部分支持者的信念，亦可是比賽的一種。馬續問，根據案發時政治氣氛，參選人是否認為表現得越激進就能獲越多選民支持？區指視乎政治人物定位，並同意對素人而言尤甚。法官陳仲衡一度質疑是否問及意見，區指那是「政治常識」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續引區諾軒 Facebook 文章〈我對立法會協調的「囚徒困境」理解〉，提及「無論知名度、議事經驗、往績，做過議員一定比未做過的好，這叫做現任優勢（incumbency advantage）」，區同意現任議員比素人更有優勢，因可參考往績、從社會議題看到其表現、其政治理念較清晰、透過多年服務聚集支持者，公眾亦可知該人是否勤力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，陳志全為兩屆立法會議員，公眾會熟悉其政綱，區同意，並同意陳作為時任立法會議員享有「現任優勢」。馬問陳是否沒有「鬥黃」，區表示「我會話佢冇誘因鬥黃」，亦指沒有印象陳的言行比過往激進。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷716宣布休息-官問誰指示及付款予香港民研做民調-區認是問號&quot;&gt;戴耀廷7.16宣布休息 官問誰指示及付款予香港民研做民調 區認是「問號」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就區諾軒退出初選，區確認在7月15日於 Facebook 宣布退出初選工作，趙家賢翌日亦退出，戴耀廷同日在 Facebook 宣布休息。區表示事前曾去戴耀廷的港大辦公室商討，戴指要「諗一諗」，二人其後沒再討論，區並在宣布退出時將其聲明連結發送至組織者群組，戴沒有特別回應。法官李運騰問，故區只能從戴的公告得知其決定，區同意：「不過相信佢係受我影響嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示戴耀廷7月16日的帖文，提到初選協調的主要工作已完成，「因過去幾個月的勞累，我希望在未來的一段日子，爭取多一些休息時間，也可以更專注於學術的工作。」帖文亦提到選舉日前兩周會開始進行民調，結果會在9月2日公布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，若區和趙退出、戴亦休息，誰繼續進行民調？區指已委託香港民意研究所。李再追問：「但誰會向他們發指示和付款？」區答：「呢個係一個問號嚟」，黃碧雲、楊雪盈等多人發笑。區指民調始終要開支，他不確定民主動力有否「畀定一個民調嘅錢」，「有關問題可以問返民主動力。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡亦指，戴在帖文沒有提及要「退出」初選，只是指當時餘下需要做的已不多，望爭取多些休息時間。區同意，故「以事論事，我就轉述咗『休息』呢個字眼」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;立會選舉延期後陳志全辭任-法官問及僅35名民主派當選情況&quot;&gt;立會選舉延期後陳志全辭任 法官問及僅35名民主派當選情況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全最終報名參選立法會。區諾軒確認原定9月的立法會選舉延期，現任議員續任至少一年，惟陳志全當時沒有延任並辭職。馬維騉其後就立法會程序發問，問反對派取得立會過半，是否可預期立法會和各委員會主席均由民主派擔任？區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡即指，立法會主席一般不會就預算案投票，若「35+」望否決預算案，是否不會投選民主派任主席？區指不一定，要視乎當時環境，如建制派是否有足夠議席；並同意若民主派只有剛好35人當選並任立會主席，只有34人能投票。法官李運騰指馬的問題有太多前設。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問民主派過半是否令政府寸步難行-區稱取決政府是否願意商討&quot;&gt;辯方問民主派過半是否令政府寸步難行 區稱取決政府是否願意商討&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬表示，若民主派和建制派各有35席，情況會很「棘手」（tricky），但若有多於35席，會預期民主派佔據立法會大部分重要職位，區同意。馬續問，若反對派獲得多於35席，能否說會令政府「寸步難行」？區指取決於政府與立法會多數派是否願意「一齊傾」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指過半後政府或以dq拘捕等將多數變為少數&quot;&gt;辯方指過半後政府或以DQ、拘捕等「將多數變為少數」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，若上述情況出現，有兩種「解決方法」，一是政府與反對派磋商（negotiate），二是政府以不同方法，將立會的「多數變為少數（reduce the majority into a minority）」，有被告發笑。法官陳仲衡問是什麼意思，馬解釋變成少數有很多方法，包括DQ。李運騰問馬是否假設法庭會容許這樣發生？馬說認為政府比法庭更有權力，多人發笑，李亦微笑，馬即指雖有人發笑，但他無意作出諷刺（sarcastic）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，認為問題不恰當，又反問辯方指所謂「消除多數（remove majority）」的意思是「殺了他們？（“By killing them?”）」，着馬要問得更具體，多人發笑。馬指在極端情況下，可能是拘捕和DQ。陳慶偉問馬最終問題為何，馬指對現時答案滿意，沒有再追問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意政改須獲三分二支持-引張炳良書指香港民主路要談判才有機會&quot;&gt;區同意政改須獲三分二支持 引張炳良書指香港民主路要談判才有機會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後指，預算案一般過半數便能通過，惟政改方案則須三分之二議員支持才能通過，亦與達致普選息息相關，區同意。陳仲衡問，故35+目標從不是要取得立會三分之二以推動政改？區確認：「冇咁講過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問區，是否必須多於三分之二才能啟動政改，而特首如不獲足夠支持，也不能以自己想要的方式（in its own way）推動？區同意，指可參考《基本法》第64及74條，又指因此這麼多年來，「我哋成日話民主派係關鍵少數，就係因為民主派有起碼三分之一嘅議席。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，故政府事實上在推動政改上沒有話語權（does not have a say），而是取決於能否獲三分之二議員支持？而即使特首想推行政改，亦不是他一人說了算？區同意，並問法官能否引述一位學者說法，陳仲衡着他指出，又指「相信不是D1（戴耀廷）吧」，有人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，前香港運輸及房屋局局長張炳良在2022年（應為2021年），曾出版《Can Hong Kong Exceptionalism Last?（香港的例外會長久嗎？）》一書，提及香港要實現民主政制，根據既有機制是要凝聚社會上的共識：「首先特首要同意咁做、立法會要有三分之二議員支持（換言之係香港大多數嘅政治團體），更加重要嘅係要得到中央政府嘅支持，起碼要通過呢三個窗口，所以特首很難一個人說了算。」區急促談及書本內容時，傳譯主任一度大聲打斷：「慢慢嚟唔該」，多名被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，這是否令「五大訴求 缺一不可」更難實現（more unrealistic），因特首的想法並非決定性（determinant）？林卓廷說「嘩」。區續說：「所以……睇咗咁多嘢、反思咗咁耐，我都係覺得香港嘅民主路係要透過談判，大家一齊傾，凝聚社會共識，大家先至有機會。」林卓廷聞言一度嘆氣低頭，鄒家成亦攤開雙手聳肩和發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意引權力及特權法成立調查委員會同須三分之二議員支持&quot;&gt;區同意引《權力及特權法》成立調查委員會同須三分之二議員支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，若是由議員而非政府提出法案，則需在地方選區和功能組別均取得過半支持才能通過，區同意，指出是「分組點票」制度。馬續指，同樣情況亦適用於引用《權力及特權法》成立專責委員會作調查，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意陳志全投票前會詳閱議案文件&quot;&gt;區同意陳志全投票前會詳閱議案文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉最後向區諾軒指出辯方案情，指陳志全每次在投票前，都會仔細考慮議案及預算案的內容。主控萬德豪質疑問題太籠統和問及個人意見，法官陳慶偉遂改問：「你與陳志全曾在立法會共事，以你們的關係，他是一個盡職盡責（conscientious）的議員，他是否於投票前均會仔細審視相關文件？」區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區表示無聽過陳志全提及會無差別否決財案&quot;&gt;區表示無聽過陳志全提及會無差別否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指出，以區諾軒所知，陳志全從沒說過任何關於會無差別否決預算案的言論。控方問是否談及二人對話，法官李運騰遂將問題改為：區有沒有聽過陳志全提及，若當選的話會無差別否決財政預算案？區表示沒有聽過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬再指出，若政府願意提出落實普選、全民退休保障計劃、反性傾向和種族歧視、同性婚姻等議案，陳志全是否必定會投票支持。李運騰打斷指他將太多問題放在一起，令問題過於揣測（speculative），陳慶偉亦指辯方已指出陳投票前會仔細考慮法案文件，「你怎能問這條問題（指陳必定會支持）？」林卓廷大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬最後再指，若政府推動與陳志全政治主張相符的議案，陳會支持，李運騰質疑他是否有必要問，即使證人回答亦沒有價值，又指馬的第一條問題已達到目的，最後馬表示已完成盤問。案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;墨落無悔稱支持度低須停選舉工程-區認屬政治常識多年嚟選民都做策略投票&quot;&gt;墨落無悔稱支持度低須停選舉工程 區認屬政治常識：多年嚟選民都做策略投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，馬維騉今亦就陳志全在 Facebook 張貼的「墨落無悔」聲明書發問，區同意該聲明的作者在選詞用字上沒有諮詢過他，對曾否諮詢過戴耀廷亦沒有相關資訊，並同意馬指「墨落無悔」與初選組織者無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;聲明列明，參選人「若支持度跌出各區預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」。被問讓支持度低的參選人避免浪費支出是否政治現實或常識，區指「如果你覺得自己冇辦法當選，就冇必要繼續花費落去」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問，落敗者不能繼續選舉工程不正是「35+」其中一個目標嗎？區解釋協調機制分為兩階段，首階段是初選勝出者據協議數目報名參選立會，其中新東目標贏6席、派7隊參選；第二階段則是正式選舉前，據民調結果決定最後支持6隊還是7隊參選，若排名低於第7隊，就不能繼續參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，因此「墨落無悔」相關要求基本上是與35+「共同綱領」的所謂共識相符？區指「係有呢個背景喺裏面」，並同意陳仲衡指35+其中一個目標亦是不希望浪費選票。馬維騉總結，勝算低者停止選舉工程、避免浪費選票均是過往選舉已沿用的政治常識，區指該想法是基於多年來香港選民都會「策略投票」，集中選票予最有勝算者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「墨落無悔」列明「我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，馬維騉一度問該「會」的意思是強或弱，惟陳慶偉指區並非作者不能回答。區亦同意李運騰指出，港島楊雪盈在初選落敗後仍報名參選，是有違「35+」精神。楊的名字有出現在「墨落無悔」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;35公民投票文件無提否決權-惟區不同意是提名表列明參選人須認同的文件&quot;&gt;「35+公民投票」文件無提否決權 惟區不同意是提名表列明參選人須認同的文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉亦展示陳志全的提名表格，當中列明「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」。區早前在大律師沈士文盤問下同意，沒有一份文件以「民主派35+公民投票計劃」命名，據其理解該「計劃」是指涉各區共同綱領。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉今展示從趙家賢電話搜得、題為「民主派35+公民投票」的文件，談及初選提名和投票的日程和安排、各區目標議席等，又指在中央直接為港制定《國安法》的情勢下，參選人被DQ風險大增，籲所有熱愛民主的港人積極參與投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指案發時曾看過該文件一次，推斷應在6月頭到中旬寫好，確認文件沒有提及使用否決權，亦無提及「35+計劃」的意識形態。李運騰問文件對象是參選人還是大眾，區指「我連份文件畀邊個我都唔清楚」，最初想過是否予傳媒；至於文件由誰撰寫，區稱：「好大機會係民主動力嗰邊嘅人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續問，故提名表格條款上「民主派35+公民投票計劃」是否指這份文件，區不同意，重申他一直的理解都是指各區共同綱領。區亦同意，新東就否決財政預算案沒有共識，僅對舉辦初選、議席數目、替補機制及舉辦選舉論壇有共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">區諾軒改稱不希望使用「騎劫」字眼 「結果又傷害戴耀廷」 區諾軒：「攬炒十步」是戴耀廷狂想、Final Fantasy 多名被告大笑 辯方指民主派奪半或被DQ拘捕 區諾軒引張炳良書指「民主路要談判先有機會」</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第廿六日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-16-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-26.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第廿六日】" /><published>2023-03-16T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-03-16T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-26</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-16-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-26.html">&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;區諾軒稱感覺被戴耀廷「騎劫」、指完全實現五大訴求「唔現實」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zN4NaTg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（16日）踏入審訊第26天。區諾軒繼續接受代表陳志全的大狀盤問，辯方庭上展示戴耀廷發出的新界東協調文件，列明「會運用」權力否決預算案，區諾軒稱此時才知悉並非「會積極運用」；又指他和社民連陳寶瑩等曾在會上對否決預算案提出質疑，被問是否認為戴耀廷「騎劫」會上反對意見，區指「確實係有呢個感覺」，指戴沒有尊重會上不同聲音。區又強調不能勉強人否決，形容戴耀廷有「盲點」，因戴沒有像他一樣接觸功能組別候選人並理解他們真正需要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，區表示雖「五大訴求 缺一不可」是示威者口號，但要完全實現是「唔現實」，指「政治始終係要有談判同妥協」，「民主嘅路始終係要一步一步走」；又指情況「接近一個死局」，舉例有大學校長曾與特首商討設立獨立調查委員會亦未能實現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱2019年12月戴耀廷文章主要目標-為立會奪半後爭真普選&quot;&gt;辯方稱2019年12月戴耀廷文章主要目標 為立會奪半後爭真普選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今繼續接受代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉盤問。就初選的背景，馬指據區所說，初選源於戴耀廷2019年12月的文章〈立會奪半 走向真普選重要一步〉，並問戴耀廷願景的主要目標，是否立會奪半後爭取真普選？區答「公道」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，雖然馬問及區對文章的理解，但事實上法庭亦可有自己的理解，並主動提出文章也有提及「不求一次決戰就取得勝利，而是一點點地削弱中共對香港的箝制」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉指他並非要斷章取義，着區看文章如何開始和收結，並問文章予「一般讀者」的印象。惟法官陳仲衡再打斷，指「我們都是讀者」，辯方只能問及區的個人印象。馬再改問區，戴是否很想實現普選，區指在文章中「佢希望達致真普選嘅目標係好明確嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱完全實現五大訴求不現實接近死局&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱完全實現五大訴求不現實、接近死局&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒同意爭取真普選是反對派自2014年已有的目標，亦是「五大訴求」之一，「五大訴求 缺一不可」是示威者常用口號。馬維騉續問，會否有人即使只有一兩個訴求獲回應亦會接受，區稱「我唔排除社會上面有一定程度嘅人咁諗」。馬續問區：「你不會幻想（dream）全部五大訴求獲得回應吧？」李運騰反問「那不正是35+的目標嗎？」，問辯方是否真的要問那個問題，馬確認。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 代表陳志全的大律師 馬維騉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指：「我認為現實政治上完全實現五大訴求係唔現實嘅，因為始終都要政府回應，我亦都相信政府唔會完全接受晒五大訴求嘅全部內容。」李運騰兩度問區是否即不認為有合理機會能實現「五大訴求 缺一不可」，區答「政治始終係要有談判同妥協」，又言「睇你點睇當中嘅訴求啦，就我而言，最終極嘅目標係我要真普選啦，但民主嘅路始終係要一步一步走嘅」，並指：「如果你問我喺2019到20年嘅情境底下，政府忽然話聽日就有普選呢，係唔現實嘅，至少喺程序上面都有好多個關卡要走，亦都要顧及香港社會各界嘅意見。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱大學校長曾與特首談及設獨立調委員會-惟未能實現&quot;&gt;區稱大學校長曾與特首談及設獨立調委員會 惟未能實現&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指不是談普選，而是認為「五大訴求 缺一不可」能否落實，區搖頭並加重語氣：「係一個好難嘅機會。」李問是否即是一個死局（deadlock）？區稱「接近一個死局」，舉例指除撤回《逃犯條例》以外，相信最易達成的目標就是「設立獨立調查委員會」，惟2019年8月一班大學校長去禮賓府談及相關問題，「似乎終歸都未能實現」，「所以五大訴求係唔容易實現嘅目標。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉指上述文章只是提及「走向重要一步」，相信在政治現實上沒有人會認為真普選會在一夜間實現，區同意是「合理的理解」。法官陳慶偉續指，戴耀廷文章亦有提及立法會有「財政權」和「調查權」，能否說當時運用「財政權」已在戴耀廷腦海出現、是其議程的首位（top of his agenda）？區回應「有喺佢個腦海裏出現」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒確認與戴耀廷不曾就初選諮詢陳志全&quot;&gt;區諾軒確認與戴耀廷不曾就初選諮詢陳志全&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續就2020年1月區諾軒與戴耀廷的飯局發問，提到戴當時辦初選，是望作為推行公民投票制度的「試點案例（pilot case）」，區同意。馬續問戴是否望選民能透過公民投票就社福議題表達意見，區指戴是想設立一個公民表達意見的平台，「內容係冇前設嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，戴耀廷和區諾軒在2020年2月至4月開始接觸有意參選的民主派，並形容為「游說階段」。區修正為「諮詢」，並指該階段於3月已完結，而當時是諮詢人們是否有意參與初選，及若辦初選會有何關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意在此「諮詢階段」，無論他或戴耀廷均沒有諮詢陳志全意見。他同意馬指，2至3月通常是立法會議員就預算案辯論的時間，投票一般在4至5月進行，而陳作為盡責的議員，無疑忙於開會，但區也知道陳志全有意參與2020年立法會選舉新界東選區。區在李運騰詢問下，亦表示首名接觸的人力成員是譚得志，曾透過《D100》 電郵聯絡他出席九東協調會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳志全派代表出席新東會議區冇印象首次會議有否談及否決權&quot;&gt;陳志全派代表出席新東會議、區「冇印象」首次會議有否談及否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續就新界東於4月14日及5月5日的兩次協調會議發問。區同意他兩次均有出席，首次有近20人，第二次起碼超過20人，而陳志全只派代表出席，首次派議員助理蘇浩。辯方指陳在第二次會議派蘇浩和劉嘉鴻出席，區指他只記得蘇，不記得有劉，亦對蘇兩次會議曾否發言「冇印象」。辯方問及有否在會上傳閱35+文件，區指就新界東而言，「我係直程呢啲文件嘅發送我都係冇印象嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8HCuXF2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 陳志全&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，「冇印象」在首次會議，運用否決權的議題有否被提出或討論。至於第二次會議，他同意會前社民連黃浩銘曾致電他要求勿認同否決預算案，而會上鄒家成提出為何用「會積極」而非「會」的字眼，並特別指向與會的民主黨和街工，有人提出「行禮如儀」；在該討論下，代表社民連的陳寶瑩「企出嚟，講出佢質疑嘅立場」，即若政府推行全民退保社民連會支持，街工盧藝賢亦表示該黨望保障草根基層收入，不會否決對基層有利的預算案，林卓廷的代表莊榮輝則稱中委會無授權他去處理相關問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，他其後提出質疑，指「唔能夠勉強人哋一定會否決財政預算案」，因若談及「35+」，無可避免會包括功能組別參選人，而他們有其業界利益。區指戴耀廷沒有針對他的看法回應，但有做整體的回應，即嘗試以「會積極」的用字迎合各人分歧。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區質疑不能勉強人否決-稱戴耀廷想法有盲點無理解參選功能組別人士需要&quot;&gt;區質疑不能勉強人否決 稱戴耀廷想法有「盲點」、無理解參選功能組別人士需要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續問，那戴的看法是否與3月31日〈立會過半是「大殺傷力憲制武器」〉文章背道而馳？陳官指戴在2019年12月的文章提及可運用「財政權」和「調查權」，其後「演進」至3月31日文章，只談及一種權力（財政權）。區先答「推論而言，可以咁講」，但續指「我諗佢又好，大家都好，都未必諗得咁嚴密」，重申戴的動機是想「說服唔同分歧」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區並指，「我會話佢（戴耀廷）嘅矛盾，反映佢有一個盲點，就係佢有冇真係聽過想參選功能組別嘅人真正嘅需要」，並解釋自己當時表示不能勉強人否決預算案，「就係因為有接觸呢一班人（功能組別參選人）。他（戴耀廷）是沒有（接觸）的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪一度指，區諾軒「嚴密」一字被翻譯作「serious」，但應用「meticulous」，區舉起左手稱「我提議係 rigorous」，多名被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問社民連及人力政治主張有何不同-區諾軒稱問題難答二者同屬進步民主派&quot;&gt;官問社民連及人力政治主張有何不同 區諾軒稱問題難答、二者同屬進步民主派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續提及，2016年立法會選舉，陳志全與社民連梁國雄組成選舉聯盟參選，區同意兩黨政治立場相似，直至2020年亦同樣。馬續指出，陳志全的代表於第二次新東會議，亦有表達與社民連相近的看法，區指「抱歉我係冇印象嘅，不過如果佢係出嚟講返個會係啲乜，咁我覺得都係合理嘅 」。馬問雖然區不記得，是否預期該代表會有相似看法？控方指證人已答過，亦是問及其意見；法官陳慶偉着馬留待陳詞，李運騰亦指即使證人答出辯方想要的答案，也只是個人意見和估計，不認為對議題有幫助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時陳慶偉問，「我只是好奇，他們（社民連和人民力量）政治主張有何不同？」區猶豫：「嗯……」多名被告大笑，有人說「好難答」，區亦俯身向證人台，邊低頭邊笑說：「真係好難答。」李運騰再問，區指兩黨經常攜手合作，那兩者有何分別。區雙手合十思考片刻，笑說「我試吓講啦」，陳慶偉一度指如他不知道可以提出，指可能只是政治上的便利（political convenience）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，可以將兩黨歸類為「進步民主派」，李運騰問是否即一個比另一個「進步」，區再答：「但大家都知道佢哋兩個政團成立嘅歷史，人民力量係由社民連分裂出嚟嘅，所以政治議題上面應該係有一啲睇法嘅分別嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉指區就分裂的說法並不正確，何桂藍面露驚訝。陳慶偉問因此區是不知道兩者分別？區指2016年後「的確好難有清楚嘅分別」，因人民力量只餘下陳志全任議員，社民連則沒有，「我哋好難從平常嘅立場、行為去評價佢哋嘅分別。」馬其後指，若說兩黨屬同一政治光譜，唯一的分別只是個人的差異，區答：「佢哋叫做光譜相似啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱庭上看辯方展示文件-才知道新東採用會運用字眼&quot;&gt;區稱庭上看辯方展示文件 才知道新東採用「會運用」字眼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後就新界東協調文件發問。馬維騉首度展示一份「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新界東協調機制協議」的文件，問戴耀廷是否曾在第二次新東會議後向所有與會者發送，區指「冇呢樣嘢」。馬再指是於會議兩日後發送，區稱「我冇印象」，亦表示「我的確係未睇過呢份文件」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰反問：「從來沒有？」區指，戴耀廷在6月9日記者會前曾在組織者群組發出各區協調文件，他曾開過但不確知是哪個，而當時印象是各區文件內容類似，均提及「會積極運用」《基本法》權力，僅新界西後來改為「會運用」權力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過辯方展示的文件，顯示「參與此協調機制的個人或團體，認同若民主派能取得立法會一半議席，『會運用』基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求，特赦抗爭者、令相關人士為警暴問責、及重啟政改以達雙普選」，區承認「我都係啱啱睇到呢份文件」，才得悉新東是用「會運用」字眼，與其印象不一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰要求展示組織者 WhatsApp 群組訊息，顯示戴於6月8日下午約1時半，接連發出「35+新西final」、「35+九西final」和「35+新東final」等多個檔案，問區辯方展示的是否該附件。區重申當時應沒有開過檔案，否則他就會注意到新東文件使用「會運用」的字眼。惟他亦表示，現時檔案呈現面前，會令他思考辯方展示的文件或就是戴發出的文件。馬維騉指相關檔案是從趙家賢的手機擷取。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區認戴耀廷以會積極字眼迎合人-惟無法解釋文件為何不用會積極&quot;&gt;區認戴耀廷以「會積極」字眼迎合人 惟無法解釋文件為何不用「會積極」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續問，故該份文件提及「會運用」權力否決預算案，是否未有反映新東第二次會議上不同黨派的矛盾看法？區同意，指「我至少睇唔到點樣大家同意『會運用』呢個字眼」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區亦同意，戴耀廷曾在各區會議用「會積極運用」來迎合不同人分歧，指該權力「可以用，可以唔用」，若政府不聽民意就可運用，形容「比起唔講任何嘢都行前一步」。區同意該情況與他昨天稱若有人對預算案感到滿意，或不會否決的說法相符。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，即在新東第二次會議，戴耀廷是想使用「會積極」的字眼以盡量迎合更多人？區同意，但指「我的確解釋唔到」為何辯方展示的文件並沒有「會積極」的字眼，而該文件亦沒有顯示為「初稿」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問戴耀廷是否騎劫反對否決預算案意見-區確實係有呢個感覺&quot;&gt;辯方問戴耀廷是否騎劫反對否決預算案意見 區：確實係有呢個感覺&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉再問，使用「會運用」一字，是否即無視反對的意見？區稱「可以咁理解」。馬再問，是否在「騎劫（hijack）」協調會議？法官李運騰打斷問是指誰在騎劫，是戴耀廷、其他人抑或區諾軒。馬續指，是戴耀廷騎劫協調會議上部分反對意見，區點頭：「我確實係有呢個感覺。」李運騰指法庭不關注感覺，而是區諾軒是否知悉，區猶豫說：「我唔講……點講呢……總的來說……」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬問區怎能知道是否騎劫，只能談及印象，惟李運騰指每個人都可以有他的印象，但法庭不是按印象來作裁決，質疑區的印象有何證據價值。馬回應望指出文件無法準確反映會議，李運騰則指可以是疏忽（oversight），但要問作者才知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續問，區指感覺被「騎劫」，是否指文件沒有充分反映會議內容，區表示據他案發時的立場「我冇理由同意一個『會運用』《基本法》權力嘅字眼嘅」。李運騰再問文件是否不能反映會上不同意見？區同意，解釋「我嘅唔同意係建基於與會人士有唔同嘅意見」。他並略激動指，他在6月9日記者會沒有反對「會積極運用」的字眼，是因為其意思有一定的彈性，「但係你係用『會運用』嘅時候呢，我就會有個感覺，係咪冇尊重到會入面唔同嘅聲音。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問會是否可指可能或必定等-區會就係會&quot;&gt;辯方問「會」是否可指「可能」或「必定」等 區：會就係會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續提及，區諾軒曾供稱「會運用」權力否決預算案可有三個意思，包括「會否決」、「會為了爭取五大訴求而否決」和「會無差別否決」，而區亦曾指用「會」一字可減低但不是消除「模糊性」，區同意，並稱「睇你『會』嘅目標係咩啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續問，區會否同意「會」一字，可解作「可能（may）」、「必定（shall）」及「會（will）」的意思？區答「會就係會」，陳志全等發笑。馬再指，但會或不會運用否決權的可能性是否仍存在，惟控方及法官均指證人已回答，區並再補充：「我從來講法係如果『會運用』就係『會運用』，但『會運用』係為咗乜嚟運用……」陳慶偉指那就是另一回事，即「動機」的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區認無就會上否決預算案意見與陳志全聯絡無向其助理查證&quot;&gt;區認無就會上否決預算案意見與陳志全聯絡、無向其助理查證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後展示「35+計劃新東訊息發布區」的 WhatsApp 紀錄，顯示陳志全只曾發出兩個訊息，包括向區諾軒就選舉論壇的安排說「Thx」，以及在初選後的2020年7月13日，發布一個「info.gov.hk」的政府網頁連結，區指沒有印象有開過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬問及，區有否向陳志全確認他知悉協調會議上的內容，區答他「冇記得咁詳細」，但應該有通知所有持分者，他們才能來開會；至於會上就否決預算案的不同意見，區承認「冇就有關事宜同佢（陳志全）有直接聯絡」。馬再問區有否向陳的助理查證，他有否將會上的不同意見向陳志全準確傳達，區指他沒有特別查證。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒無與陳志全討論選舉論壇&quot;&gt;區諾軒無與陳志全討論選舉論壇&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒早前亦稱，港島區協調會議有人民力量成員出席，區確認該區最終沒有人力成員參選。馬續指區的說法出錯，只因該些人曾在很久以前任譚得志義工，才誤以為他們是人力成員，並指其中一名女士叫「Dorda」。區指他不認識，亦不記得有誰出席，只記得有兩名中年男女，有人一開始表示「想學吓嘢」，但再沒有參與會議的討論。區亦表示，就選舉論壇沒有與陳志全特別有私人對話，主要依賴群組發布的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">區諾軒稱感覺被戴耀廷「騎劫」、指完全實現五大訴求「唔現實」</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第廿五日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-15-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-25.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第廿五日】" /><published>2023-03-15T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-03-15T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-25</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-15-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-25.html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/53mQMp9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第25天，區諾軒繼續接受代表黃碧雲及林卓廷的大律師沈士文盤問。初選提名表格要求參選人認同協調會議共識及擁護《基本法》等才能參選，區今指該「協調會議共識」視乎各區而定，而九龍西和新界東就否決預算案「確有分歧」。提名表格亦要求參選人認同「民主派35+公民投票計劃」及其目標，區指是指涉各區提及否決預算案的「共同綱領」，但承認此前沒有文件以此為名或提及相關字眼，他亦沒有向參選人解釋。區亦同意，林卓廷和黃碧雲在表格夾附的單張沒提及否決預算案，林卓廷在論壇上亦曾指視乎具體議案投票，區同意他不會無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒同意參選人毋須就否決預算案條款回應&quot;&gt;區諾軒同意參選人毋須就否決預算案條款回應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今繼續接受代表黃碧雲及林卓廷的大律師沈士文盤問。就協調文件，區同意組織者沒要求參選人就協調文件上「會積極運用權力否決財政預算案」的相關條款作出回應，該份文件亦沒有公開，戴耀廷在6月9日記者會上亦指參與者毋須簽署任何文件。他並同意辯方指，參選人沒需要公開回應相關條文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就提名表格，區諾軒同意由趙家賢草擬，他和戴耀廷審視及認可才發布，提名期是在6月9日記者會後4天，於6月13日至20日舉行，區並確認收到黃碧雲及林卓廷的提名表格。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;提名表格稱認同民主派35公民投票計劃-區指涉各區共同綱領&quot;&gt;提名表格稱認同「民主派35+公民投票計劃」 區：指涉各區共同綱領&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文其後引述提名表格，顯示「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」及「我特此聲明，我會擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特別行政區」條款，區確認參選人要同意相關條款才能參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就條款提及的「民主派35+公民投票計劃」，沈士文指其名字與最初的「35+計劃」文件（註：該文件沒提否決預算案）相似，區同意。法官陳慶偉問「35+計劃」與「民主派35+公民投票計劃」是否指同一份文件，區指前者是協調會早期的文件，但「我哋始終冇辦法迴避6月9號記者招待會，戴耀廷係有指涉到有一份文件，而去到嗰陣時呢，（該份指涉的文件）已經係去到各個區嘅共同綱領啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DDJmMoF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 戴耀廷（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，故「民主派35+公民投票計劃」是否只是一個「一般性（generic）」的說法，抑或是指向一份特定的文件？區重申根據6月9日記者會，指涉的文件「已經去到各區嘅共同綱領」。陳續指提名表格或於記者會前設計，是否設計時已考慮該記者會的內容。區指始終是由民主動力負責設計，亦的確沒有水晶球知道記者會發生的事，但重申該條款的精神，「就係總結協調會裡面討論嘅過程，以及希望參與者同意最後嘅共識」，並同意當時「會／會積極」運用否決權條款已包括在各區共同綱領內。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，條款中提及「及其目標」，組織者心中有沒有特定的「目標」？區重申「都係去返各區嘅共同綱領」，並同意法官李運騰所指，包括「五大訴求，缺一不可」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱文件無註腳需解說才明白指涉為何-區認無向參選人解釋&quot;&gt;辯方稱文件無註腳、需解說才明白指涉為何 區認無向參選人解釋&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文其後展示九西的共同綱領，題為「35+立會過半計劃 民主派九龍西協調機制協議」，並指曾出現「35+計劃」文件及協調機制初稿。區確認計劃過程中的確曾出現過幾個文件版本，但沒有一份文件以「民主派35+公民投票計劃」為題，或提及該字眼。法官陳仲衡一度指，理解一直都是同一個計劃，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續指，由於表格上就「民主派35+公民投票計劃」沒有註腳（footnote），而整個計劃亦沒有文件提過此字眼，是否代表參與者需組織者解說，才會知道該字眼指涉什麼文件？區回應，文件的確沒有明確指涉，「若當時有人叫我解釋，咁我就會指涉返去共同綱領嗰份文件」，但他在陳仲衡詢問下，確認當時沒有收到這樣的要求，他亦沒有向其他人解釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;提名表格要求認同協調會議共識-區指視乎各區而定九西新東就否決財案有分歧&quot;&gt;提名表格要求認同協調會議共識 區指視乎各區而定、九西新東就否決財案有分歧&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文又指，條款的重點為「共識」，即參選人要同意協調會及35+計劃的「共識」，區指毋庸置疑該句的邏輯關係是以「共識」為先。沈續指，故如協調會議上就否決預算案沒有共識，那表格上認同的共識亦不包括否決預算案。區答「所以要睇返參選人本身嘅睇法係乜嘢」，沈指即是要視乎個別選區共識？區指「可以咁樣理解」。他並同意，九龍西和新界東就否決預算案「確有分歧」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文其後展示黃碧雲和林卓廷夾附在提名表格的選舉單張，其中前者寫有「反抗專政 緊抱自由」，後者則有「查警黑 制警暴 止警謊」、「五大訴求 缺一不可」等，區確認，兩者均沒有提及否決預算案，亦與他早前供稱所理解的民主黨立場一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林卓廷黃碧雲選舉單張無提否決預算案林論壇稱視乎具體議案投票&quot;&gt;林卓廷黃碧雲選舉單張無提否決預算案、林論壇稱視乎具體議案投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈再引述初選論壇上，林卓廷回應嘉賓對他不會全面抗爭的質疑，林稱「我諗我哋要睇番具體嘅議案，具體嘅政策」，又指「如果政府話『每個香港人派三萬蚊』，我覺得一定要投贊成票喎，冇理由留返啲錢畀政府去做大白象工程㗎嘛」。法官陳慶偉問，根據林的回應，是否同意他不會無差別否決預算案，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文其後指，組織者是否收過74份提名表格，區指「我冇真係數過，但的確收到好多」，並同意每名參選人都要簽署提名表格，至於同一張名單之後的候選人要否簽則不確定。辯方其後展示林卓廷名單中黃凱盈的提名表格，區遂確認所有名單上的人都要簽署提名表格，並同意5個地方選區、超區和衞生服務界共74名參選人均簽署提名表格，並同樣表示支持及認同計劃共識。法官陳仲衡問，那黃凱盈要否未付1萬元按金，區答「應該係一個團隊畀一次嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前自辯的劉偉聰盤問後祝區諾軒順利，沈士文今盤問結束後亦向區諾軒致謝，祝他平安、健康（“Thank you Mr. Au, I wish you peace and good health.”），法官陳慶偉着他之後不要再提該些言論（“Can you skip all those remarks in the future?”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒其後接受代表施德來的大律師黃廷光盤問，案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1Pjec5U.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第25天。區諾軒接受代表陳志全和施德來的大狀盤問，同意至今仍視陳志全為朋友，指陳「唔係真係好激進」，核心政治信念是推動同志平權、亦爭取實施全民退保，認為政府若推行全民退保，而陳衡量後認為整體利多於弊，有贊成預算案的可能。區亦同意，民協是影響力較小的溫和民主派，施德來是「和理非」，在法官詢問下解釋「和勇不分」是令反修例運動持續的條件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在法官陳慶偉詢問下亦表示，他2020年7月15日退出初選工作後，原打算於同年10月赴日展開博士生的生活，指當時「我嘅人生計劃係離開政壇」。陳續問，區是否不會親眼見證整個「攬炒十步」的過程，區答「唔會，同埋我都唔想（此事）喺香港發生」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區至今仍視陳志全是朋友-指同志平權是其核心政治信念&quot;&gt;區至今仍視陳志全是朋友 指同志平權是其核心政治信念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今接受代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉盤問。馬先表示會問簡單問題，望區諾軒簡潔回答，區稱「我會努力」，馬並稱會以「Raymond」來稱呼陳志全。區諾軒在馬的提問下同意，與陳志全曾任立法會同事，二人屬民主派，就社福議題有相近立場，亦經常一起工作、吃飯、定期交談。馬其後問，二人是否有一同玩「Pokémon GO」的手機遊戲，陳志全、余慧明、林卓廷等多名被告發笑，區亦俯身笑稱「係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/np0hT7b.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 陳志全&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意視陳志全為朋友，直至現在仍是，認為他友善、理性，亦是立法會其中一個最勤力的議員，指「佢嘅工作係受到梁君彥肯定嘅」，林卓廷等起鬨，有人發笑及說「嘩」。馬維騉指，其實就是時任立法會主席梁君彥讚陳志全是民主派最勤力議員，而幾乎眾所周知，陳的會議出席率近乎100%，區均指「正確」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，民主派可被稱為泛民、非建制派及反對派，而陳志全於2012年當選新界東立法會議員，不久後「出櫃」，公開宣布他是一名男同志。馬續指，陳志全幾乎整個任期都非常積極推動同志平權，亦很重視同志權利，區同意，指這是其「核心嘅政治信念」，亦同意陳為推動性小眾議題需經常與政府及建制派合作，舉例政府曾找陳志全做諮詢，陳亦曾與葉劉淑儀交流，區亦同意同志平權議題是「全方位」，涉稅務、出入境、房屋等問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，如果政府就反歧視或性小眾平權等作回應，陳志全是否會毫不猶豫支持，區同意，亦同意陳亦希望政府實施全民退休保障，並就該議題與社民連和他自己均站在較前線的位置。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指陳志全唔係真係好激進&quot;&gt;區諾軒指陳志全「唔係真係好激進」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，陳志全2016年續任立法會議員，他是人民力量主席，與譚得志一同主持電台節目，分別綽號「慢必」和「快必」。馬續問，從二人姓名是否可反映他們不同，區說「據我認識佢哋都係唔同嘅」，馬欲繼續追問，惟陳慶偉指不相關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區其後同意，由於人民力量比傳統泛民較為「進步」，故可歸類為「進步民主派」，亦同意因陳志全是該黨唯一立會議員，故是該黨的「標誌」。馬維騉問陳是否並非激進（radical），區答「佢都唔係真係好激進」，陳志全苦笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱退出初選工作後原計劃離開政壇-不會見證亦不想攬炒十步在港發生&quot;&gt;區稱退出初選工作後原計劃離開政壇 不會見證亦不想攬炒十步在港發生&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後提到區是公共政策博士，其研究範疇包括亞洲的全民退保。此時法官陳慶偉打斷指，區曾稱於2020年7月15日退出初選工作，那他研究生的計劃是怎樣的？區指，「我本身打算喺2020年10月嘅時候，開始我博士生嘅生活」，計劃飛去日本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指，原本立會選舉於同年9月舉行，假設一切如期舉行，區是否仍會在立會選舉後飛去日本？區答：「我本身已經計劃咗離開香港，甚至可以咁講⋯⋯當我決定離開、退出呢個35+工作啦，我嘅人生計劃係離開政壇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，換言之，即區不會親眼見證整個「攬炒十步」的過程？（“You would not see the 10 steps mutual destruction through?”）區搖頭答：「唔會，同埋我都唔想喺香港發生。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒同意若政府推全民退保-權衡利害後會支持&quot;&gt;區諾軒同意若政府推全民退保 權衡利害後會支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續就全民退保發問，區同意他重視全民退保，社民連亦曾表示若政府推行全民退保，會支持預算案。馬續問區，若政府在預算案推行全民退保，他會否投下支持票？區答「我會支持」，「如果我仲係立法會議員，我就會喺財政預算案度投支持票」。法官李運騰笑着問，「不論議案內容？（Regardless of the content？）」吳政亨、陳志全和彭卓棋等隨即大笑，區答：「因為政府會做全民退保嘅政策，所以我會支持呢個預算案。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續指，預算案可能有其他項目，如要求議員減薪，區續指「呢個就係同政府談判嘅重要啦」。李運騰問是否只能全部贊成或反對，不能選擇性支持？區指終歸會去到投「贊成、反對或棄權」的議程，但此前有很多程序可以向政府討價還價；而議員雖沒有提案的權力，但也可促請政府修改方案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，是否即預算案內其他項目不能提反對，區指若有反對的項目，可以在二讀和三讀提出修正，包括刪減預算案的預算。李問政府不同意怎麼辦？區答：「我會權衡利害，若果全民退保嘅益處大於我唔想要嘅一啲項目，我都會投支持。」馬維騉總結即議案是「好大於壞（doing more good than evil）」，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區舉民政事務委員會撥款例子-指曾在立法會說服並獲陳志全支持&quot;&gt;區舉民政事務委員會撥款例子 指曾在立法會說服並獲陳志全支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續問，以區諾軒與陳志全的友誼，若政府在預算案推行全民退休保障，是否預期陳會支持。法官陳仲衡質疑區在不知道預算案內容的情況下不能回答，主控萬德豪亦指證人不能就此發表個人意見。法官陳慶偉續指，若不知道預算案所有項目的內容，相信區不能回答「他的朋友 Raymond」會否選擇否決預算案，因為這純粹是一個「互相讓步（give and take）」的過程。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，但認為公允地說，有一件事可予法庭參考。他續指曾任南區區議員的自己，很支持政府推動的一億元重點項目工程，而他於2019年9月任立法會民政事務委員會副主席，曾與時任民政事務局局長劉江華開會商討一年議程，當時他向政府保證，若政府將一億重點工程與南區工務工程，包括黃竹坑泳池興建優先放上議程，讓他在離任前能順利討論，「我會說服民主派嘅議員贊成，亦都唔好喺財委會嗰度作出冗長嘅提問。」區指，最終相關項目有放上議程，亦順利在財委會通過，而「陳志全就係其中一個我說服到嘅民主派議員」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問政府推全民退保陳志全是否會支持-區稱若認為利多於弊有可能&quot;&gt;辯方問政府推全民退保陳志全是否會支持 區稱若認為利多於弊有可能&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒早前供稱，陳志全和社民連梁國雄曾在政府答應派1萬元後停止拉布。馬維騉再次問，以區和陳的友誼，若政府在預算案推行全民退保，是否預期陳會支持。區指「如果佢認為（除全民退保外的其他項目）利多於弊，咁佢都有投贊成票嘅可能」，法官陳仲衡指他是回答可能性，區同意「始終冇發生」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬再問，陳志全如此重視同志平權，若政府提出保障性小眾權利的議案，陳是否毫無疑問會贊成？法官陳慶偉指不會容許此問題，李運騰亦指太過籠統及屬猜測（speculative），陳慶偉補充是「高度猜測（highly speculative）」，馬指會留待陳詞。李運騰續指，區已回答會權衡利害，陳仲衡亦指辯方似乎是在度身訂造一份陳志全會投贊成的預算案。馬維騉指他只是強調陳志全的政治主張，惟陳慶偉着他回去想想，明早再問些更好的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指辯方問題猜測-辯方反駁控方案情亦是猜測-官指視乎證據&quot;&gt;控方指辯方問題猜測 辯方反駁控方案情亦是猜測 官指視乎證據&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，馬維騉是否想表示陳志全就預算案是有商量的餘地（open to negotiation），並會理性考慮對預算案立場，問他為何不直接問。馬同意是他盤問其中一個目的，續問區諾軒會否同意陳志全在未知預算案的內容下，並不會無差別否決預算案。主控萬德豪即指問題高度猜測和假設性，區不能就此表達個人意見，陳慶偉同意，惟馬反駁，控方指被告會無差別否決預算案也是高度猜測。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指會將馬維騉的抗議紀錄在案，並指曾予馬時間思考，惟馬拒絕並問了一條非常差的問題（very bad question）。李運騰終指，控方案情能否成立視乎證據，指舉證責任在控方，若案情屬猜測亦不能成立，但那是法律的議題。案件明續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區形容民協溫和施德來是和理非-指和勇不分令反修例運動持續&quot;&gt;區形容民協「溫和」、施德來是「和理非」 指「和勇不分」令反修例運動持續&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃碧雲和林卓廷今早完成盤問後，區諾軒接受代表施德來的大律師黃廷光盤問。就民協的政治立場，區同意民協是較溫和的民主派，主要由區議員組成，較着重基層工作和民生議題，特別是深水埗的基層。區續指，2015至2016年許多公屋商場被領展轉賣予財團，民主派有聯合關注行動，他當時與民協合作並認識何啟明，施德來亦有參與其中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒同意認識施德來，並曾於2017年一同到台灣出席會議，當時施是民協主席。區指經多次合作，認識施的立場，指他曾因馮檢基而參與過好幾次立會選舉，馮其後離開民協，施「可以話係民協裡面嘅新生代」，又形容他是務實的區議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃廷光問施德來是否「和理非」，區點頭：「佢都係好和平、理性、非暴力嘅」，坐在施德來旁的彭卓棋隨即望向施發笑。此時法官李運騰問，區有否聽過「和理不分」，後更正為「和勇不分」，多名被告如彭卓棋、鄭達鴻等發笑，有人笑言「好嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，反修例運動參與者可分為和理非及勇武兩類，後者指「好主張直接行動嘅人」，他們不排拒暴力行動，法官李運騰問及例子，區指當時有人參與暴動或掟汽油彈。李運騰續指在初選論壇上不時聽見「和勇不分」，問區如何理解，區指反修例是持續的社會運動，很多時公眾集會出現暴力場面，「就有我哋叫做和理非嘅人去參與和平嘅遊行，呢種情況交替出現」，指「和勇不分」是令運動持續的條件。區同意據其理解，施直至2019年社會運動，亦一直維持和理非的主張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指民協影響力較小即使砌亦和平-同意與戴耀廷最初無接觸民協&quot;&gt;區指民協影響力較小、即使「砌」亦和平 同意與戴耀廷最初無接觸民協&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃廷光其後問區，有否聽過民協口號「又傾又砌」，區直言「聽過，而且好熟悉」，指「傾」是指民協很主張透過談判去爭取權益，但他們亦不排拒「砌」，即透過社會行動爭取權益。區並形容，民協是「好有歷史」的政黨，「即使講『砌』都好，都係一啲好和平嘅行動。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意在2016至2020年，民協沒有任何成員是立法會議員，亦同意他與戴耀廷最初接觸的民主黨派中，並不包括民協。黃廷光問為何不接觸民協，區指當時接洽目的是想了解不同人初步想法，「確實冇可能人人都接觸晒」，但不是刻意不接觸民協，之後辦協調會議也有開始聯絡民協成員。法官陳慶偉其後問及，區諾軒是否因民協影響力較小而沒有接觸，區同意民協是小政黨，影響力亦較小，並指當時連民協將有誰出選亦不掌握。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱第三次九東會議無詳細討論否決財案-戴提議加相關條款不獲參與者回應&quot;&gt;區稱第三次九東會議無詳細討論否決財案 戴提議加相關條款不獲參與者回應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後就協調會議發問，指區諾軒庭上供稱曾出席3次協調會議，但錄影會面提及只出席兩次。區解釋當時沒機會依賴 WhatsApp 紀錄及電話行事曆，答出並非正確的答案，但後來依賴予各被告的案情重組記憶，便確認有出席過3次。辯方指區沒有出席第三次會議，區稱「我記得我係有出席嘅」，又提議可按相關 WhatsApp 紀錄核對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指若辯方認為區是不誠實或記錯，便向他指出，黃廷光指並非去到那麼遠，只是看到有不妥的地方就盤問。法官其後要求區避席，關注辯方提問的相關性，黃廷光指不肯定區有出席第三次會議。李運騰質疑施德來若在場，為何辯方會不肯定，又指辯方有證據便可提出，但辯方承認其實沒有證據。陳慶偉又問及相關證供的意義，辯方指若區在場便會聽到戴耀廷提及否決預算案的話題，惟陳指辯方直接指出戴在會議沒有提及否決預算案便可，反問為何要轉彎抹角（beating the bush）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒其後再次入庭，黃廷光改問戴耀廷是否首兩次會議均沒有提及否決預算案，區同意，亦同意即使第三次會議戴有提及否決預算案，也沒有討論詳細內容，指「35+目標」非該次會議重點，而是談及如何宣傳。區在李運騰詢問下表示，戴耀廷當時指因為其他區都已在文件加入會積極用權否決預算案的條款，「所以九龍東都不如加返啦」，但沒有任何參與者作出回應，之後該條款亦加入九東「final」文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後問及九龍東候選人交表時夾附的共同綱領，區指是在參選人交表後，「我先為意有呢一份嘅文件」，並同意該文件並非官方文件，但與其他協調文件有一定相似性，均提及認同「五大訴求 缺一不可」，及會積極運用權力否決預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kim-jong-uns-political-control-of-the-north-korean-regime&quot;&gt;Kim Jong-un’s Political Control of the North Korean Regime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim Jong-un has consolidated power and appears more confident than ever. More than a decade ago, this outcome would have been largely unexpected, given that Kim Jong-un was relatively young (around 30 years old) and had only three years to prepare for leadership when his father, Kim Jong-il, suddenly died in December 2011. By comparison, Kim Jong-il was in his early 50s and had been in a grooming process for over 20 years when he took charge of the country when his father, Kim Il-sung, died in July 1994. Despite assessments that power consolidation would be challenging for this young, untested leader, Kim Jong-un attained six important titles that gave him firm control of the party, the state, and the military within the first six months of his rule — a period when he would have been the most vulnerable to attempted coups or other challenges to his leadership. In this regard, the recent surfacing of Kim’s daughter, Kim Ju-ae, could signal the start of a leadership grooming process of greater duration than what Ju-ae’s father enjoyed (elaborated below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since taking power over a decade ago, Kim Jong-un has used a number of tactics to further cement his hold on power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kim has relied on his nuclear and missile arsenal as an instrument of control. This has given him the capacity to both generate support and demonstrate confidence internally while signaling to foreign leaders that they will face significant risks if they challenge him.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kim has conducted brutal periodic purges of the leadership, including the executions of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, in 2013 and his minister of defense, Hyon Yong-chol, in 2015; the assassination of his brother, Kim Jong-nam, in 2017; the replacement of all of North Korea’s top military generals; and the reported purge (and possible execution) of former foreign minister Ri Yong-ho in recent months. These actions have been used to remove the confidants of his father and any others Kim has perceived as a threat and replace them with Kim loyalists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kim has “retired out” elder statesmen and arranged marital alliances for individuals in his close circle to orchestrate a generational shift within the regime. For instance, the son of Choe Ryong-hae, who currently serves as chairman on the Standing Committee of the Supreme People’s Assembly and first vice president of the State Affairs Commission, is reportedly married to Kim Jong-un’s sister, Kim Yo-jong.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To increase his popularity among the citizenry, Kim Jong-un has drawn on nostalgia among the public for his grandfather, Kim Il-sung. The grand-elder Kim had a grandiose and charismatic personality and ruled during a time when North Korea was not plagued by famine (as it was during Kim Jong-il’s rule) and had strong relations with its Cold War patrons, China and the Soviet Union. Kim Jong-un has made efforts to dress like his grandfather, and there have even been rumors that he underwent plastic surgery to look more like him.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kim Jong-un has tightened state control on information inflow into the country to enhance socialist ideological grip over its people and drive the country into further isolation. In December 2020, for instance, North Korea passed the “Law on the Elimination of Reactionary Thought and Culture” to clamp down on foreign influence. Anyone caught consuming or possessing foreign materials or cultural goods such as movies and dramas will be heavily punished. The law also banned foreign speech, hairstyle, and clothes, which Kim called a “dangerous poison.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Kim Jong-un’s successful efforts at power consolidation, the situation remains unpredictable and opaque, and it is likely that Kim’s confidence masks inner insecurity. His brutal form of rule comes with the heavy baggage of knowing that he needs to “clean house” periodically to ensure that officials around him are not only loyal but will fear consequences if they are ever tempted to challenge his leadership. Economically, Kim faces the dilemma that all dictators face: regime survival and prosperity necessitates a degree of economic opening, but the process of opening could precipitate the regime’s collapse. Furthermore, Kim’s moments of peak popularity with the public (to the degree they can be measured) have coincided with periods when the economy was improving and growing. The combined effects of the Covid-19-induced lockdown starting in January 2020, international sanctions, and severe weather in recent years have created the worst economic contraction since the period of the great famine of the 1990s. Collectively, these conditions make it likely that elites and the general public resent or even despise Kim, though they cannot express this outwardly. As a result, even as Kim displays a facade of boldness, he probably worries deep down about the security of his rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Kim faces the dilemma that all dictators face: regime survival and prosperity necessitates a degree of economic opening, but the process of opening could precipitate the regime’s collapse.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this situation, it is important to identify and look for future indicators that Kim Jong-un’s hold on power could be waning. These might include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;elite defections;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;erratic purges (shifting from Kim’s usual vacillations of promoting and demoting officials to something more dramatic and irregular);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;enhanced information and ideological control;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;increased defections or refugee outflows;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;generational tensions; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;public protest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last of these remains unlikely due to the regime’s extreme level of social control. However, given recent unpredicted popular protests in China against Covid-19 lockdown measures, social protest should remain on the list of possible developments that could weaken Kim’s control over the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-known-unknown-kim-jong-uns-health&quot;&gt;The Known Unknown: Kim Jong-un’s Health&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the biggest unknown concerning North Korean leadership is Kim Jong-un’s health, a variable that could take the form of death or incapacitation and that directly affects the trajectory of the other two variables: control and succession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim Jong-un has a number of health issues, including obesity, chain smoking, high blood pressure, gout, and a family history of diabetes and heart disease. When Kim met South Korean president Moon Jae-in at the Mount Paektu summit in 2018, he reportedly struggled to walk to and from the buses, perspiring profusely and breathing heavily. Kim lost some weight at one point, but more recently he seems to have gained it back (though it is important to keep in mind that, culturally, this might be viewed a sign of vitality in North Korea rather than a risk factor for an early death).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite his numerous medical conditions, it is difficult to speculate about when or how Kim may die or become incapacitated. The regime is opaque by design, and North Korea is one of the hardest intelligence targets in the world. The Central Intelligence Agency did not know about the passing of Kim Jong-un’s father, Kim Jong-il, until North Korea’s public announcement two days later. Periodically, Kim Jong-un “disappears” — as he did for a number of weeks in May 2020 — prompting much speculation about his condition. But even with the high level of attention these moments attract, top North Korea watchers rarely, if ever, have clear insights into the actual situation. Among experts, the perpetual answer to questions about Kim’s health is: “we do not know.” He is currently almost 39 years old (from experts’ best understanding), and his father and grandfather lived to the ages of 70 and 82, respectively. Considering that his father and grandfather had many of the same medical conditions as Kim Jong-un, he could be around for decades to come. Or, as one expert in the workshop noted, Kim “could just be one little sugar wafer away from [his] demise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important factor in determining the impact of Kim’s health on regime stability will be the timing of his death or incapacitation, specifically whether it occurs in his old age following a lengthy period of leadership transition or takes place unexpectedly and suddenly with no clearly identified successor. The latter situation would be the most precarious in terms of creating the potential for a failed succession process and regime instability. That said, while succession crisis scenarios must be kept in mind, one expert noted that the most probable outcome if Kim Jong-un were to die today would be a relatively smooth transition of power, perhaps to Kim Jong-un’s sister (discussed in further detail below). As in the past, the system is likely to perpetuate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;plans-for-leadership-succession&quot;&gt;Plans for Leadership Succession&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North Korean constitution does not enumerate a succession process; it is not institutionalized in the state. Yet there was a clear process to the two past successions prior to and following Kim Il-sung’s sudden death in 1994 and Kim Jong-il’s sudden death in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is currently no clear successor to Kim Jong-un. However, a number of developments in recent years have brought succession questions to the forefront, including the public debuts of Kim Jong-un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, his sister, Kim Yo-jong, and his 10-year-old daughter, Kim Ju-ae.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The North Korean constitution does not enumerate a succession process; it is not institutionalized in the state. Yet there was a clear process to the two past successions prior to and following Kim Il-sung’s sudden death in 1994 and Kim Jong-il’s sudden death in 2011.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel experts agreed that Kim Jong-un’s sister, Kim Yo-jong, would be the most likely transitional leader if her brother were to die or be incapacitated in the near term. Kim Yo-jong has had significant power within the system for a number of years. While her debut on the world stage occurred around 2018, she had been running the powerful Propaganda and Agitation Department since at least 2015. By 2020, Kim Yo-jong assumed an even more significant role at the Department of Organization and Guidelines, where she oversaw important daily decisions on personnel matters such as who would be monitored, demoted, promoted, punished, or banished. She was also authorized to run South Korea policy and U.S. policy. By 2021, Kim Yo-jong reportedly returned again to her prior position in the Propaganda and Agitation Department. She seems to be ambitious, in contrast to her older brother, Kim Jong-chul, who lacks interest in politics and was passed over long ago as a possible heir. Optics also indicate that Kim Yo-jong is powerful and trusted by Kim Jong-un. In the heavily choreographed events surrounding the leader, she is the only individual who moves freely, guiding others on where to stand and making spontaneous moves such as fetching an ashtray for her brother. These menial acts counterintuitively suggest a degree of power for Yo-jong that no one else has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transfer of power to Kim Yo-jong would mark the first horizontal transition of power, as well as the first female leader of North Korea. The past two successions have been vertical, passed from one generation to the next. While these would both be significant firsts, there are currently no other members of the family within this dynastic system who seem as capable or interested in leading as Kim Yo-jong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other figure who has received significant succession-related attention in recent months is Kim Jong-un’s daughter, Kim Ju-ae. She first appeared in public by Kim Jong-un’s side in November last year at the inspection and launch of a Hwasong-17 missile. Kim Jong-un reportedly has three children, one son and two daughters. Kim Ju-ae, the second child and first daughter, is estimated to be 10 years old. She was the child who Dennis Rodman famously held when he visited North Korea in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim Ju-ae’s now-frequent public appearances are highly unusual, given the Kim family traditions of extreme privacy. Basic information about the children of North Korean leaders had been guarded as a close secret in prior generations. The first photo of Kim Jong-un and his siblings was not released until April 2009, and Kim’s name was not announced until 2010, one year before he took power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unveiling of Kim Ju-ae at this particular time, and at her particular age, has generated a great deal of speculation about Kim Jong-un’s possible intentions. Some have said that Kim’s introduction of his daughter provides a means to humanize him or to make him appear fatherly and responsible as a custodian of the country’s nuclear weapons. Others have suggested that Kim Ju-ae’s debut serves as a signal, both internally and externally, that North Korea’s status as a nuclear state and the Kim family’s hold on power are secure and will be passed on to future generations. The parading of Kim Ju-ae could also be a useful distraction from further advances in North Korea’s weapons programs. A more extreme yet still plausible explanation is a power struggle between Ri Sol-Ju and Kim Yo-jung. As Kim Yo-jung’s political power within the regime began to grow, Ro Sol-ju may have wanted to keep her in check and make it clear that her children are in the succession line. All of these explanations, or some combination of them, seem plausible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Kim Ju-ae’s debut serves as a signal, both internally and externally, that North Korea’s status as a nuclear state and the Kim family’s hold on power are secure and will be passed on to future generations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that Kim Ju-ae’s recent public outings mark the early stages of a succession process, though there are reasons to be skeptical of this explanation, particularly given her young age. As one expert noted, “Ju-ae would need a phone book to . . . reach up and touch the nuclear button. She’s probably not first in line right now.” Furthermore, Ju-ae’s term of endearment, the “most beloved,” does not necessarily imply that she is considered the most qualified leader. If Ju-ae’s public debut was an aspect of grooming, there would likely be more deification of her, such as showcasing her abilities to lecture scientists on fissile material or get multiple holes in one on the golf course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it remains possible that Kim Ju-ae could be her father’s designated successor. The number of appearances with her father have proliferated since the beginning of 2023. Even though she has an older brother, who would be the most expected choice, given the vertical, male lineage of North Korean leaders that has prevailed thus far, his father might not deem that he is up for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the possibility that Ju-ae’s older brother is the actual successor. Under this scenario, the older brother is being protected from public scrutiny, perhaps attending a boarding school in Switzerland as his father did, while Ju-ae serves as a useful distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One panelist noted the possibility that the intelligence on Kim’s children has been faulty, and Ju-ae has no older brother — after all, he has never been seen in public, so there is no firm evidence that he exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two possible explanations for the patterns surrounding the women in Kim’s life. Kim could genuinely be a North Korean version of a “liberated man” seeking to empower women. But the opposite could also be true, that Kim’s elevation of a number of women reflects his insecurity. According to this line of reasoning, in a patriarchal society such as North Korea, women are less threatening to Kim than men. He can therefore use women to show that he has a support system around him and that there is a generation ahead of him. At the same time, his female cadre sends the message that he’s “still the man,” both literally and figuratively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the situation with Kim Jong-un’s health, there is no way to know for sure why Kim has chosen to raise the profile of his daughter at this time, or women within the regime more generally. Given these levels of uncertainty, all possibilities should be considered, even the ones that seem unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most conversations concerning North Korea in recent months have focused on its nuclear and missile programs. This is understandable, given the unprecedented 95 cruise and ballistic missile tests North Korea conducted in 2022, alongside preparations for a seventh nuclear test. The regime started 2023 with a battery of ballistic missile tests in February as well. But an examination of who is controlling the country’s nuclear weapons and missile systems is equally important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the current situation is deeply concerning, it is worth considering whether Kim Jong-un’s sudden demise would bring better unknowns. Is this something to hope for or something to fear? Perhaps the answer is both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two specific pieces of advice for policymakers grappling with how to manage leadership uncertainty in North Korea. On the one hand, it is important to focus on the current leader, the one “in front of the curtain now,” for “that’s the one we have to deal with.” At the same time, in considering the future of North Korea, it is important to keep a number of scenarios in mind, including the less likely “wild-card” ones. Balancing these two imperatives will help to ensure that policymakers are prepared to deal with whichever leadership scenarios the future may bring — from an extended period of Kim Jong-un’s rule to an abrupt succession and regime instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assumptions about leadership are baked into all policy decisions on North Korea. They should be made explicit and periodically revisited when considering various policy options. Exercises such as this CSIS workshop — mapping out a range of possibilities concerning three pivotal “known unknown” leadership variables — help to serve that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;區諾軒：不同意強迫他人否決財案做法 對無法維護多元聲音感內疚&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/u6412FS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（14日）踏入審訊第24天。區諾軒繼續接受盤問，同意「會積極」用權否決預算案的字眼由戴耀廷「發明」，但加入協調文件後新東及九西無進一步會議討論和達成共識，林卓廷及黃碧雲亦無簽署「墨落無悔」或「共同綱領」。區並認為民主派應維持多元性，故不同意當時部分人強迫他人同意否決預算案的做法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒同意他與戴耀廷是「35+計劃」的「主要推手」，他自己主要負責行政。法官李運騰問誰是「大腦」，區指「較少爭議嘅就係戴耀廷負責咗好大部分佢對於35+嘅理解」，即論述工作，又指戴在理論和主要發言人方面都是較主要位置。區主動補充，初選期間接觸較多相對保守的參選人，甚至社民連及民主黨等會託付於他，並突然表示：「我自己覺得好內疚，我係維護唔到多元嘅聲音。」官一度指不需深究該點（“You don’t need to go into that.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒新東第二次會議曾指不能勉強人否決財案&quot;&gt;區諾軒新東第二次會議曾指不能勉強人否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今繼續接受代表黃碧雲及林卓廷的大律師沈士文盤問。區早前供稱與戴耀廷辦初選「初心」不同，他的目標是協調民主派爭取立會過半，戴則着重運用否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區今確認，他在所有協調會議都沒有主動提出立會過半後否決預算案，並只在新東第二次會議提出質疑，表示「始終民主派有好多唔同人參選，唔同人有唔同諗法」，而功能界別參選人會顧及界別利益，「唔能夠勉強其他人否決財政預算案」，但不記得有誰回應。沈士文問上述是否他反對綑綁參選人否決預算案的例子，區表示：「我係有表達過唔同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈總結，故區諾軒在整個35+計劃的態度，是任何人都可以就否決預算案提出他們的看法，但不能強迫和綑綁其他候選人去否決？區指他的確不想綑綁其他人，但「公允地講句」，到了6月9日初選記者會，他的確無反對過戴耀廷對否決預算案的看法，此後也沒有反對，重申當時沒想到會犯法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區重申會積極運用字眼為戴耀廷發明-惟加入後新東九西無會議討論&quot;&gt;區重申「會積極運用」字眼為戴耀廷發明 惟加入後新東九西無會議討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，在6月8日，戴耀廷已將各區協調機制的「final」文件檔發予組織者，上有「會／會積極運用」權力否決預算案的條文，問區既然有不同看法，加入該條款是誰的主意？區重申是戴耀廷的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文再引述區諾軒錄影會面謄本，提及戴耀廷發表〈真攬炒十步〉後他即向戴提出質疑，並在新東第二次會議後，向戴及趙家賢反映兩個政黨的意見，指他們作為初選主事者，沒理由不理不同人看法而「表達一個咁激進立場」，戴則回應認為「積極運用《基本法》權力否決預算案」字眼是作為「大家討論嘅平衡點」，可予不否決的空間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒在法官詢問下確認該兩黨為民主黨和社民連，而「激進立場」是指戴耀廷在〈真攬炒十步〉提及一定要否決預算案致解散立法會和特首下台，並搖頭指：「當時候我哋開過咁多嘅協調會，佢（戴耀廷）冇理由唔知道唔同與會人士嘅意見。」區同意李運騰指，他與戴耀廷出現爭論（argument），但二人沒有直接在協調會議上交鋒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒重申，文件上否決預算案條款並非參與者的共識，這亦解釋了為何「會積極運用」字眼有一定程度彈性。他同意該字眼是戴耀廷的選擇和發明（choice and invention），戴在對否決預算案有爭議時使用該字作為「討論的平衡點」。但區承認，該字眼加入協調文件後，新界東和九龍西已無進一步會議及討論；並同意只知道戴有向其他人發送協調機制初稿，但「確實唔知道」他發送予誰人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱最遲於2020年3月24日-會積極一字已出現於協調文件&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱最遲於2020年3月24日 「會積極」一字已出現於協調文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問，由戴耀廷於6月8日發出各區協調文件的「final」檔，到各人報名參選、出席論壇、舉行投票，有沒有參選人提出要修改該份文件？區稱「我冇掌握到相關嘅資訊」，但同意新界西和九龍東候選人報名時夾附了共同綱領。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續就「會積極運用」字眼的源起發問，區表示在3月26日的初選記者會上，戴曾提及「我哋可以諗吓點樣運用基本法嘅權力」，但就他所知不同人有不同想法；當天晚上戴在首次港島協調會議提出相關議題，司馬文表示反對，戴遂開始以「會積極運用」的句子嘗試說服司馬文。區指據其憶述，「會積極」字眼在港島最早就是於當天提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於其他區，其中最早於3月2日舉行首次會議的九龍東，區指當時只就沒有否決預算案字眼的「35+計劃」文件討論，至3月尾的第二次會議，亦是爭拗替補機制等，無印象有討論否決權；是在不遲於5月4日的第三次會議，戴耀廷才「忽然話因為其他區佢都已經加咗（會積極運用權力否決預算案字眼），所以佢就想九龍東都加返」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於在3月24日舉行首次會議的九龍西，會上傳閱「35+計劃」文件，會後再傳閱有「會積極運用立法會權力」字眼的協調機制初稿。區在李運騰詢問下同意最遲於2020年3月24日，「會積極運用權力」用字已出現在初選的文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意林卓廷黃碧雲無簽共同綱領-與民主黨墨落無悔後不綑綁否決立場一致&quot;&gt;區同意林卓廷黃碧雲無簽共同綱領 與民主黨「墨落無悔」後不綑綁否決立場一致&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續指，戴耀廷於6月9日記者會表示參選人毋須簽署任何協議，是否因為參與者對否決預算案有分歧。區回應「就我理解，當時候係驚取消資格嘅問題」，沈追問意見分歧會否是其中一個原因，區再稱「佢應該冇咁諗」，指戴回答提問時曾指不會製作一份文件令政府取消參選者資格。區並同意，林卓廷和黃碧雲報名時沒有簽署或夾附任何共同綱領。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續問，二人行為是否與區諾軒對民主黨立場的理解一致？法官李運騰質疑問題假設民主黨對黨員有統一的政策，但事實上胡志偉本人報名時也夾附了共同綱領。沈遂改為提及，區諾軒早前供稱理解民主黨立場是望保留彈性，不綑綁否決預算案，至「墨落無悔」也沒有改變，區同意。沈遂問，據區理解黃碧雲和林卓廷沒有簽署及夾附共同綱領，是否與民主黨該立場一致？區確認，指二人報名時「都見唔到佢有轉變」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指墨落無悔及三投三不投非35一部分&quot;&gt;區諾軒指「墨落無悔」及「三投三不投」非「35+」一部分&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文其後續就「墨落無悔」聲明及「三投三不投」發問。區同意「墨落無悔」聲明是對戴耀廷記者會上稱參選人毋須簽聲明的回應，與35+計劃「毫無關係」。沈續問區作為組織者，是否不同意部分參選人試圖強迫其他人同意否決預算案？區指「民主派應該維持多元性，所以我唔同意當時嘅一啲做法」，他亦確認不止林卓廷和黃碧雲，「成個民主黨都冇簽（墨落無悔）𠻹。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「三投三不投」，沈士文提及吳政亨曾以「李伯盧」為筆名，於2020年7月3日在《蘋果日報》刊登關於「三投三不投」的廣告，區表示從報章得知，並在盤問下指除「墨落無悔」聲明「一定唔係大會嘅一部分」，「我都唔認為三投三不投係大會（35+計劃）嘅一部分嚟」，此時鄒家成與吳政亨交談，吳亦一直微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後指，區明顯沒有參與「三投三不投」，不能代表組織者之一的戴耀廷指戴與吳政亨沒有同意將該運動作為35+的分支計劃（sub-project），區答「我只能講我自己啦」，吳政亨發笑。沈士文一度問若「三投三不投」是「35+」的分支計劃，戴是否會告訴區，惟官稱問題太長，辯方無再繼續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指不知三投三不投財政及宣傳詳情惟認不包括在35財政&quot;&gt;區指不知「三投三不投」財政及宣傳詳情、惟認不包括在「35+」財政&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續指，「35+」的組織者／協調者是否包括區諾軒及戴耀廷，區同意，同時補充還有民主動力，並主要是他及戴耀廷透過趙家賢聯絡民主動力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問及，區有否留意到「三投三不投」與「35+」的財政、架構及管理層面上有任何聯繫，區表示戴耀廷只提及曾與李伯盧聯絡，至於當中財政及宣傳上的詳情「我一概不知」。李追問，「35+」的主要推手（primary mover）是否區及戴，區回答「可以咁講」；至於趙家賢及民主動力，則是他們找來協助辦初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問「35+」的財政由誰主管，區回應是民主動力，他們負責整理要申報的資料，最後攤分並向選舉事務處申報有關開支。陳仲衡續指，若「三投三不投」是「35+」一部分，那相關支出必然會納入「35+」財政，區回應雖然他並非負責財政，但以其理解，「三投三不投」是不包括在相關申報資料中。至於「35+」的籌募資金上，區表示由民主動力負責計數及宣傳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指戴耀廷負責咗好大部分對於35嘅理解在理論及主要發言人均有主要位置&quot;&gt;區指戴耀廷「負責咗好大部分對於35+嘅理解」、在理論及主要發言人均有主要位置&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問及區諾軒與戴耀廷如何分工，區指他主要負責出席協調會議，以及聯絡不同派系人士、就他們的需要作溝通，同時負責整個選舉論壇的舉辦。李問是否屬於行政方面，區指「可以係一個較主要嘅部分」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續問，誰是計劃的「大腦（brain）」，是區抑或戴？區表示：「我諗較少爭議嘅就係戴耀廷負責咗好大部分佢對於35+嘅理解」，解釋「我意思係論述嘅工作」；至於組織的工作，「佢當然有出席好多嘅協調會議，以及相關嘅活動啦，佢亦都係主要負責聯絡香港民研嘅人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李問，那「35+」的「理論思維（theoretical side）」方面由誰負責？區指從整個計劃期間的公開言論，戴耀廷的確負責較主要的位置。最後就「主要發言人（main speaker）」，區表示：「毋庸置疑，佢（戴耀廷）係一個較主要嘅位置嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱獲保守參選人託付-惟內疚維護唔到多元聲音&quot;&gt;區稱獲保守參選人託付 惟內疚「維護唔到多元聲音」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區接着主動補充，「大家可以見到隨住初選嘅情節發展啦，相對保守嘅參與者或者唔同嘅參選人，我係接觸得比較多嘅，甚至係佢哋個別亦都託付於我。」李運騰追問是否指黃浩銘？區解釋「包括社民連同埋民主黨」，並突然指：「我自己覺得好內疚，我係維護唔到多元嘅聲音。」李運騰一度指不需深究該點（“You don’t need to go into that.”），有被告發笑，在延伸庭的袁嘉蔚則露出「O嘴」的表情。沈士文續問區，他是否知道黃碧雲及林卓廷沒有支持「三投三不投」？區指自己沒有留意，亦非適合的角色去談及此事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">區諾軒：不同意強迫他人否決財案做法 對無法維護多元聲音感內疚</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Revive Arsenal Of Democracy</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-14-revive-arsenal-of-democracy.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Revive Arsenal Of Democracy" /><published>2023-03-14T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-03-14T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/revive-arsenal-of-democracy</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-14-revive-arsenal-of-democracy.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russia’s war in Ukraine has reinforced the necessity of maintaining a deep inventory of weapons. Any future operational plans assuming that a war will be short-lived may run against a capable and determined adversary willing to wage a prolonged conflict.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;That is what has happened in Ukraine, where Russia’s plan for a quick decapitation strike and absorption of further territory was thwarted by the fierce resistance of the Ukrainian people with the support of allies and partners, led by the United States. It is now a war of attrition. The protracted nature of the war has prompted questions and reflection on the readiness of the U.S. defense industrial base, though the current conflict is not yet an exercise in industrial mobilization. To date, the robust support that the United States has provided to Ukraine has primarily come out of stockpiles, drawing the United States down to levels that have triggered concerns as to whether there are sufficient residual inventories for training and to execute war plans in the case of a conflict in which the United States is directly involved. It is no longer a question of whether the U.S. industrial base is prepared to rapidly surge production in the case of a direct conflict with a capable adversary — it is clear that it is not, and that is because the necessary investments have not yet been made to make it so.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In World War II, the United States served as the “Arsenal of Democracy” — a term President Franklin D. Roosevelt used to refer to the key industrial role U.S. industry played in the Allied war effort — but it took more than five years for the industrial base to fully gear up for the war effort.[1] If the United States were to be directly engaged in conflict, the time it could take to surge production represents a serious vulnerability. Why is surging production so complicated, and why would it take so long?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before this conflict, concerns about the shallow depth of U.S. precision weapon inventories, the preferred weapons of defense planning scenarios, loomed in the Pentagon and Congress. This vulnerability is just now being elevated by policymakers. Language in the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) authorizes an increase in the acquisition of new munitions, for example, including with multiyear buying authorities. Reaching the programmed number may take years to finish at current production rates , so discussions are increasingly about the need to surge production levels as a solution, and the U.S. Army is taking steps to support this. However, years of underinvestment mean that the industrial base may not be sufficient to both refill and increase stocks while meeting demands from allies in the timeframe that can have a warfighting impact at the speed of relevance. Furthermore, the commercial defense industrial base itself faces an incentive structure that motivates a least-cost production model at the expense of capacity and delivery speed, which means that manufacturing slack has been eliminated to the extent possible. While this incentive structure is designed to ensure that the Department of Defense (DOD) can invest in as broad a range of capabilities as possible and to carefully allocate taxpayer funds, it has reduced the ability of the defense industrial base to surge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a formal requirement with clear targets for higher sustained volumes — and with issued contracts — defense contractors have not risked investing in the production capacity that is now needed. This issue is pervasive across the defense manufacturing ecosystem, not just for munitions. Refilling inventories in a reasonable timeframe or preparing for surge more generally may require contractors to invest in additional capacity to allow for production to increase. It is thus worthwhile to review the steps required to boost production rates so that policymakers have an understanding of what it takes to surge and, more specifically, what types of investments are required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question that must be addressed when considering surge production for any capability is whether existing factories and facilities have the necessary capacity to expand in-house production. Generally, an increase in production using existing facilities and workforce would be the most cost-effective approach, so assessing capacity is a key first step. The fixed costs of production (e.g., facilities and machine tools) may be useable for up to three shifts. If the factory is not at full capacity and has space for additional production requirements, more workers can be hired or additional shifts can be added. Recruiting and retaining workers is more challenging when unemployment rates are low and workforce participation rates are already high. In early February 2023, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is 3.4 percent. One major defense contractor reported offering $10,000 bonuses to existing workers for identifying new skilled mechanics who join the organization, and paying long-distance relocation costs for the new skilled touch labor employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the factory is running three shifts at full capacity, there is the potential to increase production by using industrial engineers to look for new ways of doing the work, to speed up assembly, or to otherwise find efficiencies. The search for production efficiencies is not a new one, so one challenge is that the increasing automation and adoption of production approaches such as lean manufacturing may have already taken all significant slack and unnecessary expenses out of the system, an approach driven both by advances in industrial engineering and by government contract incentive structures that focus on reducing costs. There may still be room for improvement, particularly if the factory is able to use robots where increased automation is possible. Changing production approaches might require additional training for the workforce, along with coordinating with a union if there is a represented workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing capacity within an existing facility will require an increase in other inputs besides labor. Deliveries of raw materials, parts, subassemblies, and whatever components go into the goods being produced will need to increase to support the new production rate. Increasing production at final assembly sites requires an increase in the full range of inputs. If supply chains are constrained, increasing production may be difficult or even impossible. For some subcontractors, their defense production may represent a small portion of their total output, and increasing the percentage of their output sent to defense contractors may not make economic sense if it harms their relations with other, more profitable customers. Aerospace is the largest market for titanium, but the metal has multiple consumer uses, including in automobiles — and there is a single U.S. producer of titanium sponge and titanium castings. Castings and forgings have been identified as a risk item by all services of the U.S. military. Semiconductors are used across the entire spectrum of manufacturing and have lead times of up to six months. Requirements for U.S.-sourced subcomponents, down to the material level, complicate production growth; contractors cannot just turn to the open market to look for new suppliers without a rigorous qualification process. Government regulations for defense contracting require U.S.-sourced subcomponents, generally down to the material level. Some munitions materials have such adverse environmental impact that they are not available in the United States, causing dependence on foreign sources and critical points of failure. Thus, investments in increasing the supply of manufacturing inputs are fundamental to a successful manufacturing surge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of munitions production, the DOD retains some manufacturing capacity in-house, such as artillery shells and chemicals that go into making explosives and propellants. In these government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) facilities, the commercial entity that manages the GOCO may have limits on investments in facilities and tooling that may not exist in contractor-owned and contractor-operated (COCOs) sites. The operating contracts for GOCO plants have a relatively short durations (5 to 10 years), which limits companies’ assurance that they can recoup and profit from investments, if they are allowed to make them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If additional factory space necessitating capital expenditures is required, there may be a corporate review process for approval before decisions are made. If the plan is approved, the new facility may either be built at the same site or at a different location. Building the facilities at the same site offers certain economies of scale, especially in terms of management. For example, plant management can take responsibility for the additional production space, the same human resources staff can oversee the process of recruiting, hiring, and training new employees, and new workers can get trained by existing production employees. Likewise, the quality assurance staff can oversee the quality processes for the new production lines. While additional personnel may be required in each of these functions to support the capacity increase, the institutions themselves are in place. For the facility itself, issues with the local community or federal regulatory agencies regarding permits, environmental impact assessments, and other technical challenges may have already been addressed. The local community may have longer-term relationships with, and thus greater trust, in plant management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are also downsides to collocating additional production space. If factories have already expanded their radius of recruitment because of the low local unemployment, additional workers may be difficult to find. Building in a new location also has the benefit of reducing the risk of having a single point of failure. For example, climate-related emergencies such as tornadoes and hurricanes have the potential to wreak significant damage, although factories may be hardened against all but the most unusual events. Human-caused disruptions such as terrorism or adversary attacks represent other risks. In one historical example of hardening against such disruptions in the 1950s, a second production for the California-built F-86 Sabre was developed in Columbus, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the decision is made to build in a “greenfield” site, the first step is to identify the location. Some states and localities may offer subsidies to attract new business, such as direct investments, tax rebates, and investments in roads. Some may have labor laws that are more advantageous to employers. It takes time for a company to collect and analyze this information. Some types of production also have very specific constraints, which may shape location decisions. Shipbuilding needs to occur on the coast, and appropriate land can be very scarce and subject to additional environmental constraints relating to littoral environments. The construction of nuclear-powered ships and submarines brings additional complications, which will contribute to the difficulty of any increase in submarine production to support AUKUS. Another example of such an issue is choosing the site location for factories working with energetic explosive material, as these will need to be located at a distance from population centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new facility will also need to be designed, and there might be a time lag if a competition for the architect is held. Plants should be designed with industrial engineering considerations in mind, so space limitations should not constrain the manufacturing approach. Plans can be started in advance of the location decision, but there may need to be some changes based on the specific site. A variety of building permits will need to be obtained before building can commence, and there may be additional necessary permits depending on the production processes, such as those involving paint with volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Getting permits can be time-consuming and require support from counsel to work through the procedure and deal with any rejections. After the building is constructed, additional inspections by government regulators will likely be required before work can start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before building commences, a competition may be held for different construction companies to ensure best value and lowest costs. Once a contractor is chosen, some work may start immediately, but there may be items necessary for building construction with long lead times due to supply chain challenges. Building a facility to support construction may have specific requirements that take additional time and expertise, such as extremely level floors or advanced air filtration, along with the usual requirements, including electricity, plumbing, internet connectivity, landscaping, and fire alarms. New roads, a rail link, a runway, or other local transportation infrastructure may be necessary to facilitate the delivery of inputs into the plant and finished items to the customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As complicated as the above process is, the time to develop and build additional infrastructure may not be the biggest schedule constraint. For complex production processes, advanced machine tools can take years between order and delivery and may need to be sourced from overseas. This includes machines such as multi-axis metal cutting machines, lasers, and autoclaves. Particularly large machines and hard tooling can require additional support in the building foundation as well as overhead cranes to move heavy parts. Production planning and ordering machine tools does not need to wait until the building is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new site will require new plant management and whatever other on-site support functions are needed to run the factory. Manufacturing touch labor in defense production may require extensive training and specific certifications on skills such as welding, where it can take years to move from apprentice to mastery. In addition to the time necessary to recruit and hire new workers, on a greenfield location where most or all workers are new, it will take time to bring them up to speed and train them to work together as a team. Along with touch labor, other production elements such as industrial engineering, test, and quality control may need to be identified and staffed. Some individuals may be willing to move from other sites either temporarily or permanently to help start up the new location. The U.S. government will also need to staff on-site regulatory functions such as the Defense Contract Management Agency and Defense Contract Audit Agency. This is not something that the defense contractors themselves can control or accelerate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same supply chain challenges associated with increasing production capacity within an existing plant also pertain to a new facility. Suppliers will also need to surge, and in turn, their subcontractors will need to surge. Even if the necessary excess manufacturing capacity is present, components or key materials may have limited sources and those sources may be shared by multiple product lines that might be surging at once. This is not something that prime contractors can control, although long-term relationships with suppliers, including training on best practices to develop flexible responses for changing demand, can help. That will not address the question of deconflicting requirements if multiple systems rely on the same subcontractor, especially where there is a single U.S. source. Which system takes priority will be a question that needs to be resolved. Furthermore, there are difficulties in bringing new suppliers into the defense industrial base ecosystem, including concerns about losing intellectual property rights and challenges due to the stringent government regulatory environment, such as cybersecurity requirements laid out in the cybersecurity maturity model certification guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the supply chain, one strategy could include certain kinds of stockpiling of supplies — for example, maintaining inventories of materials like steel, that could be used in times of surge. This approach should focus on inputs that do not face the risk of obsolescence. In spite of long lead times for items like semiconductors, stockpiling is not a solution for those because of the rapid technology refresh in that sector, and stockpiles will risk being outdated and useless. For those, the government might encourage creating incentives for industry to develop preferred customer status with suppliers so that they can trigger priority access in the event of need. It should be noted that stockpiling or maintaining inventories of final products also comes with costs in both potential obsolescence as well as warehousing costs and regular maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building capacity for any type of defense manufacturing — not just munitions — is complicated by the lack of a clear market signal. For consumer goods, companies can make predictions about the long-term viability of a product and estimate the return on investment of building additional capacity before making decisions. Defense production is different. The DOD is generally the only U.S. buyer for defense goods, and government policies often reduce or eliminate the contractor’s ability to sell in the commercial market — that is, to foreign militaries. If a contractor invests its capital to increase capacity, and a surge in DOD requirements never materializes or results in signed contracts, the contractors would not be able to recoup their investments in that now excess capacity, and an increase in cost structure may impact their ability to successfully compete for future contracts. Multiyear contracts can provide additional fidelity to future demand, but the DOD needs congressional approval before issuing multiyear contracts, and Congress imposes limits on their use, although the 2023 NDAA authorized them for certain munitions purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the hardest questions when planning for surge are who is going to pay for it, and how. The question of funding any necessary increases in capacity will need to be answered before capacity can be increased. A long-term commitment on the part of Congress and the services will be necessary for defense contractors to make these investments. In addition, the government will need to ensure that future contracts support the maintenance of excess capacity — of slack — rather than continually drive to low-cost solutions. The clear challenge here, as ever, is competing priorities. Investing in increasing the surge capacity for existing systems may reduce the government’s budget for modernization investments that will produce capabilities needed in the future fight. Finally, since most of the companies in the defense industrial base also produce for the commercial industrial base, they may not want to tie up capital by maintaining slack capacity if the incentives are insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that a strategy of working with allies can alleviate some of the strain on the domestic defense industry. “Ally-shoring” or “friend-shoring” — one approach that has been identified to take advantage of any existing capacity in the industrial bases of close allies — may be able to accelerate the potential for surge. Of course, this relies on whether there is slack capacity overseas, which would need to be assessed. Depending on how production is allocated, this can free up U.S. facilities for more advanced weaponry where export controls and intellectual property concerns could push production to stay in the United States while allocating existing capabilities to overseas suppliers. The key negotiating points to address will be deciding what is produced where, which country or which companies pay for necessary amendments to infrastructure, and how technology transfer considerations are handled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next war that the United States faces may not be one where it enjoys a distinct capability advantage, as in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Allied Freedom. For a long war against a more capable adversary, the United States may need to more directly draw on its industrial base, with production going directly from the factory to the front. After a year of supporting Ukraine primarily out of existing stockpiles, there are signs that political leadership recognizes the need to awaken the “Arsenal of Democracy” in continued support of Ukraine and to refill the “empty bins.” Engaging the United States’ larger manufacturing sector for a longer-term production increase will be a more significant effort. Developing an implementation approach to do so — an operational or “OPlan” for mobilization — is something that planners should work on now. The challenges of supporting Ukraine should show us that we are certainly not thinking about this too early, and hopefully not too late. If there is a future conflict, the nation will have to go to war with the industrial base that it has at the time. The World War II model of engaging the industrial base in five years may not be sufficient for a conflict with a highly capable adversary with a strong industrial base, a strategy of onshoring all the components of production, and near-monopoly power over critical subcomponents, including critical materials used in defense production across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China seeks to fully control Taiwan through three distinct but interrelated campaigns: persuasion, coercion, and compellence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;American policy’s focus on compellence marginalizes strategies that counter China’s persuasion and coercion campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China is more likely to achieve its goals through persuasion and coercion or a form of compellence, such as a blockade of the island, short of an amphibious invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US must urgently rethink its defense of Taiwan so that it blocks all three roads to Chinese victory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US policy to defend Taiwan from Chinese aggression is overly focused on the risk that China will attempt an amphibious invasion of Taiwan. The US is not paying sufficient heed to Chinese efforts to regain control of Taiwan through persuasion and coercion, and US strategies to block a Chinese invasion may actually undermine efforts to block the persuasion and coercion roads to Chinese success. Xi Jinping likely prefers to accomplish his aims by means short of war. Those roads offer Xi the prospect of success at much lower risk and cost than fighting a war. The US must develop strategies to defeat these campaigns while deterring an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing faces a difficult set of choices between military considerations and geopolitical dilemmas that US discussions of a putative Chinese invasion often fail to consider adequately. A militarily optimal Chinese invasion strategy would require that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) strike American bases in Japan, a US treaty ally, and Guam, US territory, early in a conflict. Such attacks would bring the US fully into the war and expand the conflict to include Japan and other East Asian states. American strategists may worry that the US would not commit fully even after Guam was attacked or that the Japanese would try to remain neutral, but neither scenario is likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi has no reason to be confident in outcomes that would be optimal for China. Such attacks, after all, would be even more radical moves than Vladimir Putin’s have been in Europe. American strategists cannot take for granted that the US and its allies will behave optimally, but Xi cannot dismiss the possibility that they would. He will thus face an unpleasant choice once he decides to invade — accept the risk of expanding the war greatly or leave fully operational the bases from which a possibly devastating US military response might come. These considerations, among others, make strategies of persuasion, coercion, and military isolation short of invasion far more attractive to Xi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s persuasion and coercion campaigns target the will of Taiwan, the United States, and America’s allies to support and defend the island. Ongoing Chinese demonstrations of military capability accompanied by “lawfare” — the weaponization of legal arguments for political purposes — and information operations aim to convince the American people, US allies, and the Taiwanese people that the Taiwan issue is a domestic Chinese matter that other countries should leave to Beijing to “resolve.” They also try to demonstrate that Taiwan is not defensible and that any use of force to resist Chinese aggression would result in a catastrophe for Taiwan and any intervening force. China’s persuasion campaign works to rewrite history and convince other nations of things that are not true in order to erode resistance to its aggression against Taiwan. China’s coercion campaign is a form of “violent bargaining” meant to use means short of large-scale war to force other nations to comply with its demands and defer to its interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also aims by persuasion and coercion to set the conditions for a campaign of compellence: the use of force through blockade or invasion. That is why it is vital Washington not allow Beijing to isolate Taipei, push America into a standoff defensive posture that pulls the bulk of its military forces outside the Chinese anti-access and area-denial (A2/AD) zones within which US forces are most at risk, and undermine US efforts to build a coalition. A blockade accompanied by other means of isolating Taiwan is an attractive option for China. Beijing could force ships en route to Taiwan to stop for inspections, disrupting the supply of resources to the island. The Chinese Communist Party could then attempt to use the PLA to convince the American people and US allies that a US response to break the blockade would be escalatory. Chinese persuasion and coercion campaigns are meant to induce precisely such responses should Beijing escalate to the overt use of force on a limited basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US must urgently reorient its approach to defending Taiwan against all three of China’s roads to controlling the island. Deterring and ability to defeat an invasion are necessary but insufficient conditions for success in maintaining the status quo: a de facto independent Taiwan. US approaches to those challenges must reinforce rather than undermine US and coalition efforts to defeat China’s persuasion and coercion campaigns. US strategy for defending Taiwan must defeat each of China’s interrelated campaigns separately and all of them together. Policymakers must explain and defeat Chinese information operations aimed at the American and global publics so that they understand and can resist China’s persuasion campaign. The US must demonstrate its commitment to the defense of Taiwan to its own public, Taiwan and potential coalition partners, and Xi himself. America must defend the rules-based international order specifically as it applies to Taiwan against the incremental escalations of Beijing’s coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been moving along three roads to fully integrating Taiwan into the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and extinguishing Taiwan’s autonomy: persuasion, coercion, and compellence. American policy has focused increasingly on preventing China from seizing Taiwan by force — blocking the compellence road. But China can still secure its goals through persuasion and coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Xi Jinping likely prefers those roads to the much riskier path of overt military attack on the island. Blocking the Chinese roads through persuasion and coercion is not a marginal task, nor is it inherent in the effort to deter or defeat a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. The current US approach to blocking the compellence road may in fact increase the likelihood that Xi will reach his objectives by these other two paths. The US must urgently rethink its approach to the problem of defending Taiwan’s autonomy so that it blocks all three roads to PRC victory rather than focusing on only one — at the expense or even to the detriment of defending Taiwan against ongoing persuasion and coercion campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;persuasion&quot;&gt;Persuasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can easily overstate the Chinese preference for “winning without fighting” or ascribe to Chinese military thought an intellectual patent on an idea that other societies and cultures value and share. Frequent and facile references to Sun Tzu’s aphorism that “those who render others’ armies helpless without fighting are the best of all” contribute to this danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that repetition of this aphorism has made it seem trite, however, does not strip it of its force in Chinese thought. The concept of buzhan ersheng (不战而胜) — to “subdue the enemy without fighting” — has been a cornerstone of Chinese strategic thinking for centuries. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has pursued a massive military reform and modernization program since 1993 in preparation for modern, great-power warfare, even as Beijing has intensified a coercion campaign that uses real and threatened power to achieve its aims. But China has not abandoned the psychological strategies that helped the CCP successfully topple the Republic of China (ROC) during the Chinese civil war and take over mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of so shaping an adversary’s understanding of the world that it voluntarily chooses one’s own preferred course of action is a highly evolved part of Chinese strategic thought and practice. The idea of causing the enemy to perceive its own benefit in choosing the path most favorable to oneself is heavily discussed in Sun Tzu, encapsulated in the observation that “what causes opponents to come of their own accord is the prospect of gain.” Mao Zedong translated that aphorism into an accessible analogy, describing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;three ways to make a cat eat a hot pepper: stuff it down the cat’s throat, disguise the pepper by wrapping it in cheese, or grind the pepper up and spread it on the cat’s back. In the latter case, the cat will lick itself, thinking it is doing something for itself when it is actually doing what you want. This is the essence of strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soviet theorists expanded on this idea in considerable and meticulous detail under the rubric of “reflexive control.” Soviet writer Vladimir Lefebvre described reflexive control in the following manner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In making his decision the adversary uses information about the area of conflict, about his own troops and ours, about their ability to fight, etc. We can influence his channels of information and send messages, which shift the flow of information in a way favorable for us. The adversary uses the most contemporary method of optimization and finds the optimal decision. However, it will not be a true optimum, but a decision predetermined by us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflexive control is at the heart of Russian information operations and hybrid war theories. The CCP has long studied and learned from Russian thought and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mao’s theory of how to prevail in war was based on what he called the “three magic weapons.” The CCP, or politics, is in the lead. It wields armed force together with “the united front” to “storm and shatter the enemy’s positions.” Armed force is calibrated to support the ongoing work of political struggle to defeat an enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA has always had robust political warfare units alongside its conventional units. Its General Political Department (GPD) was devoted to undermining enemy morale and building international support. The GPD helped build the United Front with the Kuomintang (KMT) against the Japanese while subverting the KMT military to further its aims in the Chinese civil war. The GPD was reorganized in 2015 into the Central Military Commission’s Political Work Department. Its responsibilities are to conduct the “three warfares”: public opinion warfare, legal warfare, and psychological warfare. This department, along with the new Strategic Support Force, where the PLA’s cyber, space, electronic warfare, and information warfare units reside, is responsible for conducting political warfare in peace and war, including the ongoing coercive campaign against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s theory of victory rests on the destruction of Taiwan’s morale: If Taiwan believes that the US will not or cannot help undermine China’s escalating threats, it will have to accede to Beijing’s demands. Taiwan is a small, isolated island with little acceptance as an independent state. It is sui generis in international relations. Absent US support, it is not difficult to imagine morale on the island collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s persuasion campaign is thus aimed at not only Taiwan but also the US and its key allies and partners. Beijing continues to use all the tools at its disposal to drive general acceptance of the reality it desires to instantiate — that Taiwan is part of China, not an independent country, and that all other states agree with that premise. Its goal in doing so is to achieve preemptive recognition of its objectives and thereby collapse Taipei’s will to resist by demonstrating that Taiwan is fully isolated and alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This objective is the primary motivation behind the CCP’s constant efforts to rewrite history and current events in what often appears to be a ham-fisted way. The CCP has thus continually portrayed itself as the victim and the US and Taiwan as the aggressors in the cross-Strait dispute, despite enormous concessions and diplomatic generosity by Washington and Taipei. This argument resonates in parts of the nonaligned world and among potential US partners who would rather stay neutral in a conflict over Taiwan and more broadly in the US-China global competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as the CCP engages in highly destabilizing shows of force, it accuses the US and Taiwan of violating an “agreement” that was never made, in which the US supposedly recognized Beijing’s right to control Taiwan’s affairs. A brief excursion into the actual history of PRC-ROC relations — and America’s relations with both — is necessary to understand the scope and scale of Beijing’s revisionism as part of its persuasion campaign to isolate Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ROC, not the PRC, was China’s sovereign government after the fall of the Qing dynasty. Though the ROC never controlled all the lands it claimed, it had all the trappings and juridical elements of a state for most of the period in which it ruled mainland China. The ROC conducted all official diplomatic business for China before the CCP’s victory in 1949. The ROC was part of the grand alliance in World War II and a charter member of the United Nations Security Council. Consistent with the prominent role it was to have after the war, the ROC, not the CCP, accepted the surrender of the Japanese on Taiwan. The CCP only came to power after its violent rebellion against the duly constituted ROC government run by the KMT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP prevailed on the mainland, but the ROC survived and retreated to Taiwan. The CCP governed, had sovereignty, and was the legitimate ruler only over the mainland of China, while the KMT had sovereignty and legitimate rule over the island of Taiwan and the offshore Matsu, Pescadores, and Quemoy islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP consistently denies and attempts to persuade others to deny the historical and geopolitical reality that there have been two Chinas since 1949: an ROC on Taiwan and a PRC on the mainland. The US recognized the ROC (including its claims to rule all of China) from 1949 to 1979 and the PRC (which also claims to rule all of China) from 1979 onward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift in US recognition did not change the reality of the two Chinas. The US made a policy choice to accommodate the PRC, a decision that had no bearing on the continued reality that the ROC legitimately governed Taiwan. Though the US made an enormous concession to its erstwhile enemy by switching its official recognition from the ROC to the PRC and abrogating its treaty with the island, the ROC still ruled Taiwan and had sovereignty over its people. The shift in US recognition was not accompanied by a formal agreement that the CCP was the legitimate ruler of Taiwan and that the ROC was therefore illegitimate. Beijing demanded such an agreement, but it only received an “acknowledgement” from Washington of the CCP’s position that Taiwan was a sovereign part of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when the US broke formal ties with Taipei — but still refused to recognize the CCP’s formal claims — the US Congress protested and enacted with bipartisan support the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), which provides the legal basis for strong if unofficial relations with Taiwan today. The US thus never officially recognized China’s claim of sovereignty over Taiwan. Washington’s robust political, commercial, cultural, and educational ties with Taiwan are required by law. The PRC knows this yet insists that the US can somehow stop supporting Taiwan. Further, the US has a legal requirement to help Taiwan resist coercion. The TRA was passed in 1979, yet China continued with the process of diplomatic normalization. It thus implicitly acknowledged that US unofficial relations with Taiwan are part of what Washington calls “our one China policy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP not only denies this reality but also portrays itself as an aggrieved party, despite the concessions the US has made to its demands. The US shifted its recognition from the ROC to the PRC at a time when China was especially weak: ravaged by Mao’s Cultural Revolution, threatened by the Soviets with nuclear war, and readying for war with a Vietnam that was becoming hegemonic and hostile. It has still not acknowledged this tremendous US concession, but rather continues trying to force more change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand Beijing’s persuasion campaign, it is useful to understand what the US did not agree to in its “One China” policy and what Congress insisted on through the TRA and associated actions. First, the US does not take a position on Taiwan’s sovereignty. It insists that the dispute over sovereignty between Taipei and Beijing is to be worked out peacefully, without preconditions. That is why the TRA’s language requiring the US to resist Chinese coercion of Taiwan is so crucial: Washington has always maintained that Taiwan should not have to negotiate with a gun pointed at its head. That the US does not take a position on sovereignty does not negate Taiwan’s sovereignty; under international law, Taiwan is a sovereign entity. The US is making a reversible policy concession to the PRC in not officially recognizing the ROC, and it certainly never agreed to the “One China” principle (as opposed to America’s “One China” policy), which Beijing tries to persuade countries to accept. The supposed “principle” is that Taiwan has always been part of the PRC. The principle is a lie — Taiwan has never been part of the People’s Republic of China. It has been part of past Chinese empires (as well as Dutch, Portuguese, and Japanese empires), but it has never been part of the political entity that is the PRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the US never agreed to cut off unofficial ties with Taiwan or limit the seniority of officials who conduct the operations of this unofficial relationship. Indeed, the presidents of Taiwan and the US can meet if they so choose. Such meetings cannot have the trappings of official state meetings because treating the Taiwanese leader as the president of Taiwan would violate America’s definition of its “One China” policy — not because it would violate international law or any promise to Beijing. Yet the PRC protests meetings between lower levels of the US government and Taiwanese officials, increasingly through demonstrations of force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, while the US stated in a 1982 diplomatic communiqué that it would cap arms sales to Taiwan, it made abundantly clear that this cap was contingent on China’s commitment to peace as manifested in China’s military posture. But China’s military posture has grown more menacing. Given Washington’s historic position that it will calibrate its Taiwan policy based on the threat China poses to Taiwan, the US has no formal obligation to limit its military relationship with Taiwan. It has limited this relationship as a concession to China. But it can exercise with and train the ROC armed forces, and it can sell any military equipment it deems necessary to keep the peace across the strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the US never agreed to limit Taiwan’s international political and economic identity. Washington can push for Taiwan’s participation in any international organization for which statehood is not a requirement. China has in the past acquiesced to Taiwan’s participation as a separate legal entity in the World Trade Organization. China, not the US, has changed policy. Beijing is trying to persuade the US and its allies that the “One China” principle governs cross-Strait relations, that Taiwan is part of the PRC, and that the US is abrogating promises to China to this effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US must undermine this persuasion campaign and provide its allies with the political cover to develop the kind of relations with Taiwan that they want, free from Chinese intimidation. There is simply nothing provocative about this policy. The US promised not to unilaterally confer diplomatic recognition on the ROC, and it is abiding by that promise. On the other hand, the PRC is not abiding by its promise of peacefully resolving its differences with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;coercion&quot;&gt;Coercion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP has not been content to rely on persuasion to secure final control of Taiwan, of course. It has long accompanied its persuasion campaign with an expanding coercion effort. This effort fits with Thomas Schelling’s definition of coercion as a kind of “violent communications about intentions and commitment.” Schelling’s insight was that the power to hurt gives states tremendous bargaining power. Expounding on his work, scholar Tami Davis Biddle evokes one of the most memorable scenes in modern cinematic history to explain how coercion works: In The Godfather, Don Corleone tells his consigliere that he will make a noncompliant movie producer an “offer he cannot refuse” to get him to do something he otherwise would not do. Following a famous scene involving a decapitated horse’s head, the producer subsequently hired the don’s friend for an important role in an upcoming movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie producer felt he had to comply or face more harm. This cinematic example helps illustrate the PRC’s coercion tactics toward the US and Taiwan. No serious analyst doubts that Beijing is willing and able to inflict harm against Taiwan and the US if they do not comply with its demands. The act of being coerced is thus a psychological process. The coercer must manipulate the mind of the coerced. As Schelling says, the power to hurt is a bargaining power. The willingness to use it is diplomacy — “vicious diplomacy, but diplomacy.” This strategy is an exploitation of fear. Arguably, a state’s leverage over another is at its greatest when its adversary believes it has not yet used all its power, that any display of force is a restrained one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The PLA’s Theory of Coercion.&lt;/strong&gt; The PLA has been interested in US theories of coercion since the first Gulf War. Coercive strategies fit well with a CCP strategic culture that emphasizes the ability to manipulate an adversary’s psyche through stratagems. According to Mark Stokes, in the late 1990s the PLA began to theorize that US aerospace coercion was related to China’s own concepts of stratagem, which it calls moulüe (谋略). Military force could be used to attack “an opponent’s cognitive processes.” Military strategies of this kind require specific calculations of where pressure or manipulation can be applied to achieve political objectives. The PLA theorizing about coercive tactics closely resembled Mao’s writing about the so-called magic weapons of warfare. Force and political manipulation were tightly sewn into strategies that manipulate the enemy and make them concede before all-out warfare is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLA theorists wrote about the coercion of Taiwan in the context of achieving limited political objectives, short of what could be achieved through an invasion and occupation of the island. Force would be modulated based on the objective and level of resistance to it. Deterring de jure independence requires a certain level of force; forcing agreement with different forms of unification requires more force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These PLA writings coincided with the onset of the PLA modernization program in 1993. By the beginning of the 21st century, the PLA was deploying a lethal, precision-guided missile force positioned across the Taiwan Strait, enabled by a modernizing comprehensive command, control, communications, and computers and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (known as C4ISR) program. Indeed, the PLA aerospace force was the leading edge of the modernization program. At the same time, the PLA was developing anti-access and area-denial (A2AD) capabilities that raised the costs of US intervention on Taiwan’s behalf. The political message to Taiwan was clear: The PLA could inflict great harm on the island, and the US would not want to risk making a costly defense of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the PLA acquired new capabilities, it developed new options to deter Taipei’s moves to formalize its de facto independent status, co-opt Washington to contain such perceived moves by Taiwan, and set conditions for intensification of the use of force across the strait. PLA authors stressed that the threat or actual application of force is necessary to ensure its goals regarding Taiwan, and Washington understood the consequences of crossing Beijing’s ever-changing political thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA continues to debate the efficacy of demonstrations of power to affect political dynamics. The 2020 version of the Science of Military Strategy describes weishe (威慑), often translated as “deterrence,” as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a method of military conflict to achieve a political goal based on military strength . . . and determination to use strength [that] makes the other side face unworthy or even unbearable consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intended political outcome of this method of military conflict is to make the adversary “give in, compromise, or surrender,” ideally without having to engage in large-scale fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA may use military conflict at a low level to achieve a political goal. The Science of Military Strategy identifies “warning military strikes” as part of strategies to both forestall adversary actions and coerce compliance. Indeed, limited uses of military strikes against precise and specific targets can showcase the ability and determination to achieve military and political objectives and may obviate the need for larger military campaigns and operations. The PLA does not see itself as moving through distinct phases of war, from “shaping” and “influence” operations to “kinetic” use of force operations. Rather, it intertwines shaping and influence operations with kinetic operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All militaries are instruments of politics, but in the PRC the relationship has historically been more direct. The PLA is the party’s armed wing, not China’s professional military. The PLA’s foundational purpose is to help the party win political struggles and develop new political realities. In turn, the CCP’s main purpose is to expand its power over territory and peoples. The party’s history as an insurgency engaged in “people’s war” informs its current conduct as it expands its writ over Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan’s case, the CCP seeks to expand its political power over new territory and 24 million additional people that is has never ruled. This is difficult to do and would require much more force than any of the other populations and territories it now controls. The PLA is thus a crucial tool, and intensifying applications of actual — rather than “only” demonstrations of — force may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coercive campaign offers the PRC distinct advantages over a campaign to invade and occupy Taiwan. It also provides Beijing flexibility to continually redefine what it considers the bounds of acceptable political behavior by Taipei and Washington. First, unlike a campaign of brute force annihilation, Beijing can redefine success if it needs to. Second, Beijing’s negotiating leverage keeps increasing as the PLA grows stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The coercive campaign offers the PRC distinct advantages over a campaign to invade and occupy Taiwan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP’s coercion campaign has expanded even as Taipei has made concessions. The ROC abandoned its claim to be the sole legitimate ruler of all of China in 1991. In effect, Taiwan declared peace, abandoning its stated policy of unification through force, and aligned its polity with geopolitical realities. The overwhelming majority of Taiwanese residents did not come to Taiwan during the KMT retreat, and they had no say and little interest in perpetuating the Chinese civil war. They disagree with Washington’s “One China” policy and never had a say in its foundational 1972 statement that “all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but One China.” Yet they have accepted it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A substantial group of voters now supports Taiwan’s newer Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), an erstwhile opposition party that rose to power as part of the independence movement in Taiwan. But the once-oppressed DPP voters made an enormous concession by accepting that they were citizens of the ROC, not of a new state called Taiwan. The ROC is a preexisting political entity whose existence the CCP recognizes in practice even while denying its right to rule over anything. Any declaration of the existence of a new Republic of Taiwan would seem to Beijing a declaration of independence and therefore an escalation rather than a concession. But the US does not support such a political escalation and thus this option is all but impossible. Rather, the US supports the political status quo, which means that the ROC rules Taiwan and the PRC rules mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taipei also suspended martial law in 1987, which had been put in place to fight Communist subversion and infiltration. It made political changes to better reflect the reality that its government only has sovereignty over the people and territory of Taiwan, though it did not formally amend its constitution to relinquish its claims to mainland China, which ironically would have angered the PRC. The ROC thus set the conditions for a diplomatic breakthrough across the strait. Officials from each side of the strait met to work out practical matters of cooperation, from the governance of postal services to consular services. The two sides implicitly agreed to compromise on a political formulation, now referred to as the 1992 Consensus. They agreed to disagree on the meaning of “One China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ROC’s unilateral abandonment of the threat of force and the forfeiture of claims of jurisdiction over the mainland should have been the basis for a lasting peace. But Beijing’s response to Taipei’s cessation of a state of hostilities was an escalation of its coercion campaign. Before Taiwan’s first democratic election in June 1995, Taiwan’s president, Lee Teng-hui, made a high-profile visit to his alma mater, Cornell University. The PRC then conducted a series of missile tests in the waters surrounding Taiwan and other military maneuvers in response to what CCP leaders called Lee’s attempts to “split the motherland.” The US and Taiwan had never formally agreed to limit the visits of Taiwan presidents, and the US does not agree that there is a “motherland” that Taiwan is trying to “split.” There has never been a single political CCP-run entity that included Taiwan. This was a provocative escalation by Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC initiated another set of missile tests in the run-up to Taiwan’s first presidential election in 1996 in an attempt to frighten Taiwan’s electorate into voting against Lee and compel the US to rein in what they called Taiwan’s pro-independence forces. In 1999, Lee suggested the two sides negotiate on a “special state-to-state basis” in an effort to break Taipei and Beijing out of a diplomatic stalemate, just seven years after its partial breakthrough. The response from Beijing was a stepped-up rhetorical assault with escalating military maneuvers. Beijing focused on Lee’s use of the term “state-to-state,” despite Lee’s use of the modifier “special” to connote something less than official country-to-country relations. His creative formulation was meant to co-opt independence-minded Taiwanese while providing Beijing with a face-saving way to conduct relations with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s efforts to normalize relations based on a reasonable diplomatic formula that recognized CCP rule over the mainland while avoiding declaring Taiwanese independence were seen in Beijing as dangerous “splittism” (the term the CCP uses for political separatism). Beijing pocketed Taiwanese concessions as it had previous American concessions, but it failed to make any concessions of its own. Moreover, the PRC treated these concessions as provocations justifying further demands and coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This response was delivered by the Chinese General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the height of the US effort to integrate China into the global economy and establish warm commercial relations with Beijing. It occurred as the US dramatically downsized its military following the end of the Cold War. There was certainly cause for Beijing to worry about the military balance with the US after America’s thumping of Saddam Hussein’s military in 1991 — and the prodemocratic rhetoric of both the George H. W. Bush and Clinton administrations. But US actions indicated that the threat to the PRC was receding rather than growing. The Chinese coercion campaign thus began during a time of peace and prosperity for Beijing, when it enjoyed friendly relations with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries and companies had rushed into China to explore commercial opportunities while the PRC embraced foreign expertise and know-how. The Soviet Union had collapsed, removing a long-standing threat to Beijing’s north. Beijing’s ideological problem remained, however: Democracy in Taiwan undermines the CCP’s core tenet that democracy is unsuitable for the Chinese cultural context. The existence of a legitimate constitutional government actually ruling Taiwan, moreover, discredited the CCP’s claim to speak for all Chinese people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having received US and Taiwanese concessions as if they were acts of escalation, the CCP learned during this period of peace and Western outreach and engagement that threats of force could push the US to pressure Taipei. The US sent ships to the Taiwan Strait in response to Chinese missile tests in 1995 and 1996, to be sure. But the PRC convinced then-President Clinton to publicly affirm China’s position on Taiwan, rather than Taipei’s or Washington’s, while speaking on Chinese soil in Shanghai. Beijing demanded that President Clinton repeat the so-called three nos: that the US would not support (1) Taiwan independence, (2) “Two Chinas” or “One China One Taiwan,” or (3) Taiwan’s efforts to participate in international organizations in which statehood is a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The events of 1995–97 also exposed the PRC’s relative military impotence at that time, as the PLA had no military answer to the arrival of US warships in the strait. But Beijing accomplished the political outcome it sought, despite its military weakness, through an apparent escalation that was not backed by actual capability. It made a political demand of Washington based on a military bluff, and Washington complied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A DPP government under Chen Shui-bian was elected in 2000, partially in reaction to China’s military intimidation. As the CCP’s pressure grew on the Chen government, Taipei pushed for greater recognition of Taiwan’s independence. Yet Beijing convinced President George W. Bush to publicly rebuke Taiwan’s president in the company of PRC Premier Wen Jiabao, humiliating Chen in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Xi became general secretary of the CCP in 2012, his initial approach to Taiwan was relatively moderate. Taiwan was governed by a KMT leader, Ma Ying-jeou, who sought more conciliation with Beijing. Xi and Ma met in Singapore in 2015, the first meeting between the leaders of Taiwan and China and a notable Chinese diplomatic olive branch to Taiwan. Moreover, Xi did not protest when Ma took the public position that the two sides had “agreed to disagree” about the meaning of “One China,” another apparent PRC concession. The formula of “One China, different interpretations” was apparently back on the table. This formulation was in essence the same as Lee’s “special state-to-state relations” comment in 1999, as the leaders of the government of Taiwan and China met as coequals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This history is not merely of academic interest. To counter CCP revisionism, US policymakers need to understand it. And, as a matter of policy, the US should insist that Beijing does not get to choose which elected leaders of the ROC it deals with. To date, the US has not called on the PRC to return to the negotiating table with the current Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen based on this precedent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s relatively conciliatory approach to Taiwan did not survive Ma’s presidency, however. When Tsai succeeded Ma in 2016, Xi reverted to the previous CCP posture of threats and demands. During his meeting with Ma, Xi said that “as long as the 1992 Consensus and its core values are acknowledged, we stand ready to have contact.” Tsai did not explicitly accept the language of the 1992 Consensus, charting a different course from an agreement made by her political opponent’s party. This is, of course, the prerogative of any new government. China’s Taiwan Affairs Office criticized her and demanded that she recognize the PRC’s “One China” principle. Tsai nevertheless went as far toward conciliation as Taiwan’s new politics would allow. By 2016, the electorate in Taiwan had little connection to mainland China. The grandchildren of the old KMT were voters who had grown up in a democratic Taiwan. Ties with China were akin to those of Canadians with the US: a shared culture, history, and language but little else, despite the CCP’s insistence otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Beijing was warning Washington about Tsai’s “separatist” and independence proclivities, Tsai conceded in her May 2016 inauguration speech that “the new government will conduct cross-Strait affairs in accordance with the Republic of China Constitution, the Act Governing Relations between the People of Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, and other relevant legislation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This statement was another major concession by a Taiwanese leader. That Tsai represented the native Taiwanese DPP yet accepted that the ROC and Taiwan were the same entity was a difficult internal political maneuver. Crucially, she embraced the reality that the PRC governs the mainland and the ROC on Taiwan does not; she thereby opened the door to diplomatic solutions similar to those of her predecessors. But for Tsai, the meaning of “One China” was to be negotiated, not simply conceded to the PRC. Washington encouraged Tsai’s concession, but it never insisted that the CCP make any similar compromise or live up to Xi’s implicit acceptance of the “different interpretations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi has years of experience dealing with Taiwan as a former party secretary of Fujian province, directly across the strait from Taiwan. He is versed in Taiwanese politics and knows that Tsai went as far as she could go on the issue of “One China.” Yet he chose to escalate the coercion campaign, blaming Tsai for recalcitrance. The US and its allies should have made a more concerted effort, beginning then to call on Xi to return to the negotiating table and not escalate his disagreements with Taiwan’s new government through force and diplomatic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after Tsai was elected, Beijing pressured Panama and São Tomé and Príncipe to shift diplomatic relations from the ROC to the PRC. Beijing shut Taiwan out of international organizations, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Criminal Police Organization, among others. During Tsai’s presidency, the CCP has pressured companies ranging from United Airlines to Snickers to call Taiwan a province of China or face economic penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing also accelerated its campaign of military coercion following Tsai’s accession. The PLA increased the frequency of bomber circumnavigations of Taiwan in late 2016 and made such circumnavigations an enduring reality for the Tsai administration. By late 2017, PLA bombers and support aircraft circumnavigated the island. Beijing modified a civil aviation route near the centerline of the Taiwan Strait in January 2018 to allow commercial airlines to fly over open ocean in the strait, severely taxing Taiwan’s air defense system and air traffic controls. Since February 2018, the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) intensified a pattern of flights through the Miyako Strait, off the east coast of Taiwan in the Philippine Sea, and the Bashi Channel. These flights demonstrate the PLAAF’s ability to “break” the first island chain and establish air dominance over key lifelines for Taiwan and its geographical connection to the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2019, two PLAAF fighters crossed into Taiwan’s side of the median line — an unofficial boundary between Taiwan and the PRC not challenged by the Chinese military since 1999. The military maneuvers were accompanied by statements from China’s Taiwan Affairs Office and the PLA’s Eastern Theater Command about their necessity to guard against “separatists,” as if the PLA were conducting legitimate counterterror operations. In September 2020 a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman stated, “There is no so-called median line in the Strait.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This line had been another means of keeping peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The CCP’s violation and rejection of it was an incremental move to claim the waters and air around Taiwan as its own. The PRC continued this coercive campaign by increasing air incursions into the Taiwanese Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). Taiwan recorded 969 incursions by Chinese warplanes into its ADIZ in 2021 — more than double the roughly 380 carried out in 2020. In 2022, total Chinese air incursions into the ADIZ were 1,115. The PLA continually issues threatening messages in native Taiwanese dialects and allows military commentators to describe the ability of their jets to decapitate the Taiwanese leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These PLA operations are part of Chinese cognitive warfare, what Taiwan calls “cognitive domain warfare” or renzhi yu zuozhan (认知域作战). A Taiwan defense analyst has captured the purpose of this aerospace campaign: “PLA exercises first create an environment of fear, and then the responsibility of causing tension is blamed on ‘Taiwan’s ambitious politicians.’” The CCP aims to influence Taiwanese and American politics through the tension it creates. In manipulating the information space through demonstrations of force, its goal is to get important audiences in Taipei, Washington, and allied capitals to believe more pliant Taiwanese leaders could make this threat go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP has thus put the Taiwanese under the constant threat of ever-escalating violence and political pressure. One purpose of these shows of force across the strait is to coerce the US to change its policy, curtail its relations with Taiwan, come closer to the CCP’s definition of what “One China” means, and force Taipei to come with it on that journey of concessions. The second purpose is to wear down Taiwan’s resistance, undermine DPP rule, and persuade the Taiwanese of their own accord to elect and follow leaders who will concede to China’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC can fully secure its objectives vis-à-vis Taiwan if it achieves either aim. Taiwan cannot continue to resist growing PRC pressure without the active support of Washington and its allies in and beyond the region. If Beijing can reduce or break that support, Taiwan will have no option but to give the PRC what it desires. The CCP can succeed even more fully if it can actually break the will of Taiwanese supporters of policies of autonomy and resistance and elevate compliant Taiwanese politicians to power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US policy risks making a grave error by seeing China’s expanding military operations around Taiwan only through the prism of preparations for an invasion. Those operations may be part of such preparations and may help with them in various ways, but they are also strategic undertakings in their own right and are directly aimed at accomplishing Beijing’s goals. Developing strategies to deter or defeat a Chinese invasion of Taiwan may be ineffective or even counterproductive in preventing the PRC from subjugating Taiwan through a combination of these coercion efforts and the continuing persuasion efforts that accompany them, as we consider below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strategy to protect Taiwan’s autonomy and freedom from Chinese control requires blocking the persuasion and coercion roads to PRC domination of the island and deterring or defeating the compellence road. A US counter-persuasion and -coercion strategy should be focused, tightly sequenced and phased, and deliberate. Chinese political and economic moves to undermine Taiwan’s isolation should be coordinated with demonstrations of US and allied force that can ensure open strategic lines of communication and resupply around Taiwan. The increasingly myopic focus on the supposedly imminent Chinese invasion threat can seriously hinder or prevent entirely the development and implementation of such a strategy. This outcome may be in part what China seeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;compellence&quot;&gt;Compellence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC has unquestionably been developing the capability to compel Taiwanese capitulation by force if coercion and persuasion fail, but Xi’s determination to move to compellence and the imminence of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan both require more rigorous interrogation than either is currently receiving. It would be more strategically apposite for the US to approach concerns about an impending Chinese invasion in the context of ongoing Chinese persuasion and coercion approaches. An invasion or other compellent strategies are possible, but such scenarios would be escalations of current campaigns carrying significant risks and downsides for Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrow focus on the threat of Chinese invasion, moreover, marginalizes an alternative compellence strategy that would flow far more naturally from China’s persuasion and coercion efforts — a strategy of isolation. The US would do well, therefore, to take a step back from the increasingly frantic discussion of ways and means to deter or stop a cross-Strait invasion and instead reconsider the PRC strategic context from which any such decision and operation would emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China did not begin its military modernization with the express purpose of invading Taiwan. As we have stated, the PLA modernization campaign started in the early 1990s, when the PRC observed America’s military modernization demonstrated in the deserts of Iraq and Kuwait. The Gulf War shocked the world’s major militaries by demonstrating that a highly trained, professional, all-volunteer force equipped with precision strike and stealth capabilities could humiliate the world’s fourth largest army rapidly and with extremely low casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian military theorists were seized by this phenomenon and pushed for the modernization and professionalization of the Russian military in the following decades. Many other countries began abandoning long-held conscription practices and turning to professional volunteer militaries equipped with more advanced technology. The Chinese did the same and for the same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;US policy risks making a grave error by seeing China’s expanding military operations around Taiwan only through the prism of preparations for an invasion.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense analysts have grown increasingly concerned that the PLA has a set goal of 2027 to invade Taiwan, based on comments by outgoing commander of US Indo-Pacific Command Adm. Phil Davidson (ret.). But the primary importance of 2027 is that it is the 100-year anniversary of the PLA’s founding and is thus likely a deadline for it to reach new modernization milestones. The PLA can likely already conduct an invasion if ordered, albeit with high risk; as the modernization process continues, and in every year that passes, the PLA will have more capability to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA’s modernization effort is general-purpose, rather than narrowly optimized for a cross-Strait invasion. It began at a time when the PRC was pocketing US and Taiwanese concessions and increasing its demands; it continued through periods of apparent Taiwanese and American conciliation of Beijing and through periods of easing of tensions between Beijing and Taipei. Xi may have accelerated the expected date of completion of this decades-long general military buildup, shifting it into a specific preparation for a particular invasion scenario, but there is no direct and publicly available evidence of this assessment. US policymakers would do well to question the notion that this program’s date of completion represents some kind of specified invasion date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modernization program naturally enhances the PRC’s military abilities to invade Taiwan even against US resistance, but it also enhances the PLA’s abilities to pursue another form of compellence — isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolation.&lt;/strong&gt; A strategy of isolating Taiwan by air and sea flows naturally from China’s ongoing persuasion and coercion efforts. Those efforts explicitly aim to get the last few states that diplomatically recognize Taiwan to shift their recognition to Beijing. They aim to cajole states and businesses to accept and promulgate the Chinese version of the Beijing-Taipei relationship, rather than Taiwan’s — a form of informational isolation. That aim includes efforts to prevent other heads and senior leaders of foreign states from visiting Taipei or receiving Taiwanese officials in their capitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is thus in part also a strategy of diplomatic isolation. And Beijing constantly presses other countries to refrain from providing Taiwan with military equipment — a form of military-cooperation isolation. One set of aims of the current coercion and persuasion efforts is thus to use means short of the actual use of force to cut Taipei’s connections to the outside world, other than those that might run through Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The natural next escalation in these efforts is not invasion, but rather adding the overt use of force to complete the isolation. Beijing could declare a quarantine or blockade of Taiwan on some pretext and deploy its maritime power and airpower to enforce such a policy. The blockade need not be total from the start. The PRC could begin by deploying ships covered by aircraft around the island to inspect all vessels entering and leaving Taiwan’s ports for some claimed contraband — advanced weapons systems, perhaps. Beijing could similarly insist on inspecting aircraft, although attempting to enforce such a demand without actually shooting down civilian aircraft would be challenging. How many civilian aircraft, on the other hand, would continue operating through skies full of PLAAF aircraft threatening to down them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If such initial efforts failed to bring Taipei to a position satisfactory to Beijing, the PRC could escalate further to an actual blockade. Taiwan is unalterably dependent on external resources to survive, so it is almost impossible to imagine that a protracted blockade could fail to secure Taipei’s surrender on almost any terms Beijing might dictate. Moreover, given its unique lack of official status in international affairs, it may be especially vulnerable to demonstrations that it can be isolated. It would be difficult to muster the kind of defiance that Britain did under attack from Nazi Germany: Taiwan lacks Britain’s long history and strategic traditions, general cohesion, and unbreakable morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This form of compellence not only is the most natural and obvious progression from the current PRC campaigns but also seems to present a far more attractive balance of risk and reward to Beijing. It does not in principle require the PLA to engage in combat. If Taiwan’s supporters make clear they will not challenge such a blockade, then Taiwan might surrender without fighting. If either Taiwan or its supporters decide to challenge it, moreover, they run the risk of appearing to have fired the first shot, provided the PRC has arranged matters such that running the blockade requires shooting at ships or aircraft blocking routes to ports or airfields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the PRC has not managed such an arrangement, then the PLA might need to shoot first, but it might begin by hitting a civilian plane or ship. Such an action would obviously incur outrage and opprobrium, on the one hand, but it would also place Taiwan and its partners in the position of having to decide how to respond. That position would likely be uncomfortable, as competing pressures to respond to the Chinese action and support Taiwan would be offset by fears that the pro-Taiwan coalition would be initiating a war. To see this dynamic at work, we have only to look at the extensive Western discourse about the fears of prompting Russian escalation by providing defensive systems to Ukraine following Moscow’s unprovoked and illegal invasion. The West’s early wavering about supporting Ukraine against a blatantly illegal and unjust invasion requires considerably more attention than it has received, since it offers Beijing encouragement as it considers escalation toward Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isolation strategy has some downsides for Beijing, to be sure. It would be an obvious escalation to the use of force and could trigger the US and regional states to mobilize for war, thereby depriving the PRC of the element of surprise it might otherwise hope to achieve at some level in a no-notice invasion scenario. If the US and its partners responded to the isolation rapidly and in force, Beijing could find it has made the prospects of a successful invasion much worse by bringing its adversaries’ advanced military capabilities into the vicinity of Taiwan without interdicting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC would thus need to be prepared to choose either of the two most plausible actions in response to the deployment of considerable US and allied firepower toward Taiwan: de-escalate and await another moment or escalate to regional war. If the strength and determination of the US and partner response seemed to Beijing too high to challenge, then the PRC could back away, accept a temporary defeat, and develop alternative approaches for another try later on. Beijing could prepare in advance to mitigate the unpleasantness of having to climb down by defining a lesser political objective that it could be reasonably sure to accomplish — or plausibly claim to have accomplished — before it had to back away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC could alternatively ensure that its initial preparations for the isolation campaign include preparations to escalate to major conflict if a US-led coalition challenged it seriously. This approach might not be easily distinguishable from preparations for a full-scale invasion in that it would likely include putting in place all the capabilities needed to exclude US-led forces from the vicinity of Taiwan and drive off or destroy any already near the island. It might include the preparation of an invasion force, depending on whether Beijing believed it could achieve its aims by the escalatory application of the isolation approach. The PLA would face a potentially much worse military position at the start of such an escalation than it could hope to face in a surprise invasion scenario, but Beijing might also calculate that the threat of invasion could reduce the willingness of the US-led coalition to push matters to full-scale war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time-space relationships could also be central to any PRC isolation approach. The PRC appears to believe it is developing a strong network of collaborators and fellow travelers in Taiwan and that its own political warfare elements on the island may be able to paralyze initial Taiwanese responses and quickly sap the island’s will to resist. An isolation strategy would almost certainly begin with the successful isolation of the island by air and sea; any response to break blockades or quarantines would likely take days or weeks to negotiate and then bring into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial shock of isolation could engender strong psychological effects, especially if China manages to cut Taiwan’s internet connectivity and other means of communicating with the outside world. Beijing might calculate that its efforts and agents could bring Taiwan to surrender before the US is able to break through Taiwan’s isolation. The PRC leadership is moderately likely to be wrong in such a calculation; overestimating one’s ability to break the will of an adversary is one of the most common mistakes in coercion and compellence strategies. But miscalculation would change the outcome, not the decision to make the attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Beijing pursued an isolation strategy, it would undermine the prospects of an immediate escalation to full-scale attack. But this approach is still attractive as it offers the possibility of achieving Beijing’s aims without having to engage in a complicated amphibious invasion. An isolation strategy poses a potentially higher risk that the PRC might have to back down in an embarrassing fashion, but it offsets that risk by offering a climbdown before major hostilities break out and therefore before China suffers significant combat losses. It also flows most naturally from the long-standing persuasion and coercion campaigns China has been pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invasion.&lt;/strong&gt; Xi might nevertheless decide not to bother with isolation efforts, instead driving straight toward his final objective via invasion. The Chinese idealized version of this strategy would of course be attractive to Beijing: A brief period of increased tension covers the execution of well-planned and rehearsed PLA mobilization for an invasion. A short air-missile campaign shatters Taiwan’s defense and government structures while Chinese political warfare agents on the island become active, wrecking any hope of coherent Taiwanese preparations for defense. The massive Chinese fleet sweeps quickly across the strait and begins disembarking troops and vehicles onto Taiwanese beaches almost before Taipei knows what’s happening, and Chinese troops raise the PRC flag over government buildings in Taipei while policymakers in Washington and Tokyo debate what to do. Xi makes a speech from the Presidential Office in Taipei, and “splittism” is forever defeated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that even Xi seriously entertains this fantasy. The statements and actions of American and Japanese leaders and officials offer no reason for Xi to be confident that the US and Japan (or Australia) would stand idly by and watch this spectacle. On the contrary, from the PRC’s perspective, President Joe Biden has been setting informational and military conditions to prepare to defend Taiwan against an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi has clearly also been observing the disastrous Russian invasion of Ukraine that highlighted additional factors of concern. The Russians thought they had thoroughly penetrated Ukrainian society and government with their own agents and fellow travelers and built a campaign on the assumption that Ukrainians would not fight. They were wrong on all counts. The Russians also wildly overestimated their own military capabilities and competence and underestimated the inevitable effects of battlefield friction. The PLA is almost certainly more competent and able to handle friction than the Potemkin army with which Russia invaded, but friction is real in any war and the more so in complex large-scale amphibious invasions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese military leaders and Xi himself must therefore take seriously the possibilities that Taiwan will fight and that the political warfare efforts on the island will be only partially successful, that the US and its allies will respond with force rapidly and determinedly, that the PLA will not perform optimally, and, even if nothing else does, that the friction inherent in war will lead to setbacks and losses. None of these observations are groundbreaking. They serve only to say that Xi must recognize the high risks associated with invading Taiwan — unless he is a thoroughgoing fool, which he does not in any way appear to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear enough that an island of 24 million people cannot hope to defeat the massed forces of a country of 1.4 billion. The best that Taiwan on its own could hope would be to inflict painful losses on an invading Chinese force. Properly equipped and determined to fight, Taiwan might be able to do so. We shall set aside further consideration of this aspect of the scenario, however, to focus on those that are more dangerous to Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debate roils the US national security establishment about America’s capacity to stop a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Some argue that the PLA’s ballistic, cruise, and now hypersonic missiles render America’s aircraft carriers hopelessly vulnerable and that China’s air and missile arsenal and A2AD systems force the US to rely on bases far from Taiwan and on long-range standoff missiles alone, ultimately dooming any chance the US might have to stop the attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much hinges in these scenarios on when and whether Beijing would attack US bases at Guam and Okinawa, at least, and on assumptions about America’s ability to use bases in South Korea and the Japanese home islands. If the US retains the ability to use Guam and Okinawa, so the reasoning often goes, then it might be able to challenge the PLA’s ability to cross the strait or at least to impose losses that Beijing would find unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These discussions are important for considerations of invasion scenarios. One struggles to recall a successful amphibious invasion in the era of combat aircraft conducted without at least localized air supremacy. Amphibious ships are large, vulnerable targets whose sinking entails the deaths of hundreds or thousands of soldiers and the loss of large amounts of vehicles and supplies. Few if any militaries have been willing to risk sailing them to shore in the face of enemy aircraft or an enemy’s ability to concentrate volumes of high-payload munitions on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China cannot deprive the US of all ability to strike a PLA landing force. Long-range stealth bombers can refuel out of the A2AD bubble and fire missiles, some of which will almost surely hit and destroy their targets. US attack submarines and other platforms can fire volleys of cruise missiles that PLA air defenses will not completely shoot down. If China invades and the US is determined to defend Taiwan, the PLA will take losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale and consequences of those losses depend heavily, however, on whether the US can use its carriers and regional bases. The more of those assets the American military can use, the more severe the damage it can impose on the invasion force, possibly up to and including its destruction. That is one of the reasons many discussions of a Chinese invasion scenario assume that the PLA would attack US bases on Guam and Okinawa, at least, and possibly on the Japanese home islands. They often assume that South Korea would not allow the US to use its bases on the Korean Peninsula in a war that, in principle, interests Seoul very little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese military technocrats would likely prefer to begin the attack in this fashion and deprive the US of as much regional capacity as possible. The geostrategic advisability of doing so, however, rests on political rather than military considerations. Would the US absorb an attack on Guam and not thereafter regard itself as at war with China? Would Tokyo regard attacks on US bases on Japanese territory as bilateral US-China affairs that do not constitute acts of war against Japan? Would the US, having lost immediate use of its other regional bases, not activate the US–Republic of Korea mutual defense treaty (which, unlike the US treaty with Japan, actually is mutual and obliges Seoul to come to the aid of the US if the US is attacked in the region)? Would Seoul refuse that activation, thereby risking the loss of its most important ally?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As both Russia and the allies have learned, no prewar assumption holds after a war begins. Ukraine’s fighting will is beyond what analysts imagined before the conflict, the US and NATO are equipping Ukraine far beyond what was thought possible, Washington has reinforced NATO forces on the eastern flank, and there are now two new NATO members under consideration. Turning back to Asia, it is hard to imagine South Korea wanting to remain neutral once Australia, Japan, and the US (and possibly some other NATO countries) are in the fight; in a scenario in which US ships, territory, and allies are struck, the US will likely pay whatever price its allies Thailand and the Philippines demand for the use of their airspace and bases in their territory. The issue of South Korean sympathy for Taiwan (or lack thereof) is a red herring. Seoul will have to make decisions in the context of the viability of its long-term reliance on the US and America’s allies — and the possible impact of refusing US requests for help on that reliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely Xi and his lieutenants have considered the geopolitical consequences of trying to succeed operationally. If not, the China problem may be bigger than most analysts realize. In that case, either Xi is as isolated and delusional as Putin was before invading Ukraine, and therefore is undeterrable, or his grand strategic objectives have changed. From building up comprehensive national power and making incremental gains to undermine US alliances and reshape the world order, Xi would have transformed his grand strategy into one of forcefully obtaining hegemony in Asia. If Xi’s objectives have changed in such a fashion, then the US should not be preparing to counter only an invasion of Taiwan but rather a series of Chinese campaigns for hegemony. The assumption of this report is that China’s strategy toward Taiwan is part of a unification campaign, a close cousin of the successful Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang campaigns, and that any other gains Xi thinks he can secure from successful unification are secondary and opportunistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might restate these considerations more straightforwardly. A PRC invasion plan that relies on attacking Guam and US positions in Japan early in the conflict would immediately bring China into open war with the US, Japan, and possibly South Korea. US policy analysts might broodingly fear that the US and its regional allies would allow even such attacks to glance off them from a geopolitical standpoint and work to treat the war as a “Taiwan crisis” with no larger ramifications. We needn’t get into that argument ourselves to observe that Xi would, again, be a complete fool to be confident of such a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serious political and military leaders in Beijing must thus consider that a decision to invade Taiwan immediately confronts them with a second extremely thorny decision: Either Xi accepts the much greater risks to the success of the military operation if China does not attack US bases at once, or he must accept the real possibility that the limited invasion of Taiwan could rapidly become a full-scale regional or even global war with the US and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;An invasion would be an extraordinarily risky undertaking to any Chinese leader not besotted with his own power and deluded by stupid or dishonest generals and political advisers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not by any means intend to suggest that Xi might not decide that either risk is acceptable; he might. We certainly do not mean to say that strong and prompt US responses or US and American-allied escalations are certain or would be successful. Those arguing that, as things stand today, China could invade Taiwan and the US couldn’t stop the invasion might be right. Calls for increasing America’s military capabilities to defeat such a Chinese attack at acceptable costs to the US and its allies are surely cogent and should be heeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even this cursory examination of some of the invasion-scenario implications suggests that it would be an extraordinarily risky undertaking to any Chinese leader not besotted with his own power and deluded by stupid or dishonest generals and political advisers. Most leaders would prefer less risky approaches that offer the promise of securing the same outcome at lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US policy therefore cannot accept as a given that Xi is simply preparing to invade and that, when the PLA is ready, he will. We must instead reopen the aperture to see other plausible roads Xi could take to seizing Taiwan and develop strategies to block all of them rather than focusing on only one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This discussion would be of merely academic interest if preparations to defeat the cross-Strait invasion also included blocking the persuasion, coercion, and isolation-compellence roads. Unfortunately, though, the approaches generally advocated to stop the invasion actively undermine efforts to block Xi’s other roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the invasion scenario is the only one the US and its allies plan to block, the temptation will grow to pull back from the Chinese A2AD bubble, abandon reliance on Guam and Okinawa, and focus on increasing America’s long-range strike capabilities. Maximizing perceived operational effectiveness would override geopolitical necessity. Such a move would potentiate the PRC’s persuasion, coercion, and isolation efforts. It could be the case that these efforts actually enhance America’s ability to defend Taiwan and therefore increase the likelihood the US would come to Taiwan’s defense, although we question both assumptions. But would it seem that way to the Taiwanese?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual optics of that strategy involve withdrawing visible US presence from the near vicinity of Taiwan, after all. The more imminent war becomes, under this approach, the faster US carrier battle groups steam away from the island, the more US strike aircraft fly north and west from Okinawa and Guam, and the more American military bases throughout the region move into defensive rather than offensive postures. The Taiwanese would be remarkable people indeed to observe those phenomena, see the growing concentration of Chinese military assets around their island, and conclude that they should be ready to fight to the death, confident that America will be with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Openly accepting the premise that US carriers cannot survive Chinese attacks also means openly stating that moving carriers toward Taiwan, Japan, or through the strait is always an American bluff and should not be seen as a serious demonstration of Washington’s willingness or ability to fight. The utility of such freedom of navigation operations could be questioned in any event, but accepting the widely held premises about the poor US prospects for defeating a cross-Strait invasion today makes them worse than meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These discussions all tend to undermine the likely effectiveness of any strategies the US and its partners might develop to try to block the persuasion and coercion roads to the conquest of Taiwan, but they don’t preclude the construction and implementation of such strategies. Even advocates of the standoff approach to defending Taiwan against invasion, after all, generally agree that the US should develop such counterstrategies even if they also generally dismiss the significance of Chinese persuasion and coercion campaigns through their confidence that invasion is inevitable and even imminent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most serious problem with focusing narrowly on preventing the cross-Strait invasion from standoff ranges is that it almost invites Xi to try the isolation strategy. Breaking blockades requires presence. The US certainly could use long-range precision weapons to sink Chinese ships blocking or interfering with merchant vessels trying to move into and out of Taiwan’s ports — until those Chinese ships move too close to those merchant vessels to permit their safe destruction. And driving PLAAF aircraft out of Taiwan’s skies is not likely a task that can be undertaken from far-over-the-horizon bases except by destroying all the PLAAF bases on the mainland from which such operations are conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even assuming that that is a feasible military undertaking, it nevertheless would move the US rapidly toward the tremendously escalatory step of conducting a large-scale air attack on the Chinese homeland. Any approach to breaking the blockade with standoff munitions, finally, requires the US to use an immediate lethal approach to respond to a Chinese effort conducted, possibly, with less-than-lethal force. It could put the responsibility for escalating to a shooting war on the US, even though China created the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main problem with approaches seeking to break a blockade from standoff distances is not that doing so is impossible but rather that promising to do so is insufficiently credible. It is almost impossible to imagine a scenario in which the Chinese begin to interfere with Taiwan’s communications and trade with the rest of the world, whereafter the US instantly responds by sinking Chinese ships. Beijing’s isolation strategy would almost inevitably have some time to work before a serious US response along these lines even started — let alone before it succeeded, if it could. Xi might miscalculate the odds of securing Taiwan’s concession in that interval, as we have observed above, but the relatively low risks he would run compared with those entailed in a full-scale invasion make it more plausible that he would accept the risk of miscalculation here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a solution to the conundrum these challenges pose to the US: Design a counterinvasion strategy that includes a counter-isolation strategy. The far-over-the-horizon counterinvasion strategy is a problem only if it precludes or excludes counterisolation efforts. The US should and, indeed, must have far-over-the-horizon capabilities in any scenario. But it must also develop ways to operate within China’s A2AD zone, including within the range of China’s hypersonic missiles. It must be able to meet a Chinese blockade effort centered on nonlethal force with a nonlethal counter-isolation effort of its own. It must avoid the optics of withdrawing its military power from the theater as the threat of Chinese attack grows and instead, ideally, create the object of credible military power flowing toward Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recognize that these demands are easy to make and hard to meet. We have no specific suggestions to offer about how to do so technically or tactically. Our purpose in this report, rather, is to say that actually keeping Taiwan free is even harder than it seems to many. We cannot reduce the problem to one specific scenario, and we actually must focus on solving extraordinarily hard military problems to enable strategies that can defeat not only the most dangerous courses of action Beijing might pursue but also the most likely.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;區諾軒稱楊雪盈落敗後仍參選有違35+共識、港島會議及文件無提及〈真攬炒十步〉&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;區諾軒：否決財案為戴耀廷「單向」介紹 從不視吳政亨為組織者&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;區諾軒稱辦初選「初心」與戴耀廷不同、民主黨「墨落無悔」後維持不無差別否決預算案立場&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lLut8rf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（10日）踏入審訊第23天。區諾軒今接受代表港島區參選人楊雪盈和彭卓棋的大狀盤問，區諾軒同意楊雪盈政治議程主要提倡文化及動保政策，而楊雪盈並非任何港島候選人指定的替補人選，卻在初選落敗後報名參選立法會，是有違「35+」共識。區諾軒又同意，港島協調會議、初選提名表格及「35+」文件均無提及戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步〉一文，而否決預算案亦從來不是港島會議的重要議題，亦無聽過彭卓棋稱當選後會無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方一度欲問，能否說戴耀廷是將有意參與初選者「帶上船」，再試圖將否決預算案的說法「強加」在他們身上，惟法官指區諾軒無法回答該問題，辯方終無繼續就此發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒同意楊雪盈政治議程倡文化及動保政策&quot;&gt;區諾軒同意楊雪盈政治議程倡文化及動保政策&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表吳政亨和余慧明的大律師石書銘表示完成盤問，續由代表楊雪盈的大律師張耀良進行盤問。區諾軒同意，於2015年首次認識楊雪盈，當時楊有意參選灣仔區議會，向他諮詢競選的意見，楊成功當選後亦不時向他諮詢擔任區議員的意見。張耀良問，故區對楊的政治議程和任區議員的志向有一定認識，區稱「我係知道嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jfcwMD6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 楊雪盈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，楊雪盈是獨立候選人，沒有任何攻治聯繫，於2019年區選再次當選。張耀良續指，楊的政治議程與其他候選人略為不同，她在論壇自我介紹為有藝術教育背景，並在公眾服務特別提倡有關藝術和設計的議題，區同意，形容楊「好關注文化政策」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區確認，楊是非政府組織「香港文化監察」的主席，在任時曾推動不少文化政策，形容她很關注香港陶瓷業和泥窯的地方保育。他亦同意，楊曾於2018年成功爭取政府撥款10億，將低用量或少用的政府大樓改作文化用途；亦有倡議動物保護，爭取用政府無使用的土地拯救動物。張耀良問，上述是否其政治議程的主要政策，區指「可以咁講」，並解釋自2015年起有與楊恆常見面作直接溝通，故對相關事實的認知是由楊告知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意楊雪盈初選落敗後仍參選立會-有違35共識&quot;&gt;區同意楊雪盈初選落敗後仍參選立會 有違35+共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張耀良續就35+計劃發問，區諾軒早前供稱楊雪盈曾派代表出席一次協調會議，楊本人曾出席兩次。張續問，據區的記憶，楊雪盈會上是否不曾對戴耀廷有關否決預算案和五大訴求的看法表達意見？區指「佢冇表達」，亦「冇乜點表達」其他意見，但曾於第二和第三次會議對替補機制表達較強烈意見，當時羅冠聰提倡以「靈童制」，即候選人指定的方式替補被DQ者，但楊雪盈和徐子見不同意，認為應用「排名制」，即第二高票數的人作替補。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區確認，楊雪盈最終於初選落敗，但在2020年7月報名參選立法會。張耀良一度問及楊是否有違「主流」做法，惟法官陳慶偉和李運騰均指沒有所謂「主流」。區其後確認，港島區在第二、三次會議投票取得共識，決定採用「靈童制」，但未決定派出名單數量，而其他選區均預設「靈童制」。法官李運騰遂問，楊雪盈最終報名參選立法會，是否即有違35+共識？區答「係，因為根據靈童制，要係勝出者指定一位替補人選，你先至得到35+支持」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官追問替補人選-區稱有預備惟無沒透露是誰-但楊雪盈不是&quot;&gt;法官追問替補人選 區稱有預備惟無沒透露是誰 但楊雪盈不是&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在法官陳仲衡詢問下，表示袁嘉蔚和梁晃維均是被DQ的初選勝出者，他一度不肯定鄭達鴻有否被DQ，問「鄭達鴻係咪都因為公民黨嘅緣故 DQ ⋯？」鄭發笑。翻查資料，鄭當時亦被DQ。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HwFFeVQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄭達鴻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰再問，楊雪盈是否不曾被任何初選勝出者指定為替補人選？區確認。法官陳仲衡續問，港島候選人有否指定候補人選，區則答：「根據 WhatsApp 紀錄，佢哋各自表示預備咗，但佢哋最後都冇講係邊個。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上早前提及，初選參加者報名時須交一萬元按金，若違初選共識便會沒收。法官陳慶偉續問，楊的一萬元按金有否被充公？區答：「呢個唔係我管理範圍，唔好意思，可以問返民主動力嘅代表」，陳志全等發笑。陳仲衡最後問，區諾軒是否知道，楊是不是港島候選人的替補？區肯定答：「不是。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱彭卓棋與戴耀廷因初選首次會面-不肯定戴曾否發訊息&quot;&gt;區稱彭卓棋與戴耀廷因初選首次會面 不肯定戴曾否發訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀其後開始盤問。區諾軒確認，2020年3月26日舉行的首次港島區協調會議，是港島區首次及唯一一次提及運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案，亦確認港島區候選人只有一個於2020年6月29日成立的 WhatsApp 群組。區並確認彭卓棋曾出席港島全部3個協調會議，亦是該群組成員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉提及，區曾提到此前有群組發放訊息。區解釋，是戴耀廷利用 WhatsApp 的廣播功能個別通知候選人，而非互相交流的群組，並在法官李運騰提問下確認，除了九龍東一區於3月已成立「35+九東立選座談會」群組，其他地方選區的 WhatsApp 群組均在6月才相繼成立，此前均由戴耀廷個別發放訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒確認，他與戴耀廷3月在李永財議員辦事處與彭卓棋團隊會面，是戴與彭的第一次見面，而除非二人私下有會面，否則他們其後的見面只是在協調會議中。盧敏儀問及，在區在場的情況下，戴和彭是否沒有交換電話，區稱「我冇辦法講到咁仔細」，盧再問，故區是否不知道戴曾否向彭發訊息，區指只能從大方向說，戴耀廷慣常於每次協調會議向各參與者交換電話號碼，並向他們發放訊息，只是他不能精準說出戴曾否找某些人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒確認初選提名表格35文件及協調會議均無提真攬炒十步&quot;&gt;區諾軒確認初選提名表格、35+文件及協調會議均無提〈真攬炒十步〉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀續提及，區曾於宣布退出初選工作翌日，在港台節目指戴耀廷於〈真攬炒十步〉一文的觀點應與初選分開審視，並問事實上，是否在任何提名表格、35+計劃文件和港島區協調會議均沒有提及過該篇文章，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧續問，那能否說〈真攬炒十步〉一文，與初選其實是「分開（separate）」的？主控周天行站起身，指「分開」一詞太籠統，法官李運騰亦澄清，辯方問題是否指「攬炒十步」並非初選一部分（not part of the 35+ project）。法官陳仲衡指，該文章所涵蓋的範圍似乎比35+更廣泛，問題應為「35+」是否文章的一部分。法官陳慶偉着辯方重新考慮問題，李運騰補充否則會適得其反（backfire）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀指對答案感到滿意，即35+計劃任何文件和港島區協調會議都沒有提及〈真攬炒十步〉一文，區其後再次確認，「文件同香港島嘅協調會都冇（提及戴的觀點）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問戴耀廷是否強加否決預算案想法在參與者-官指證人不能回答&quot;&gt;辯方問戴耀廷是否強加否決預算案想法在參與者 官指證人不能回答&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀其後再問，能否說戴耀廷是將有意參與初選的人帶上船（took people interested in primary on board），再試圖將否決預算案的說法強加（impose）於上了船的人身上。法官陳慶偉指，其問題太長和費解，亦不認為區諾軒能回答，「他怎能知道戴耀廷是否將看法強加於其他人身上？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧遂改問，戴是否先接觸有興趣參選的人，而港島區協調會議的討論焦點在於初選機制，如參選人被「DQ」後的替補機制、選票數量，否決財政預算案從來不是重要議題。區確認，重申否決預算案只是於首次會議由戴耀廷提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱無聽過彭卓棋提會無差別否決預算案&quot;&gt;區稱無聽過彭卓棋提會無差別否決預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續確認，彭卓棋是獨立候選人，無政治聯繫，而案發時他與彭互相認識，彭亦從無向他提及一旦當選，會無差別否決預算案。盧敏儀再問，有否聽過彭向其他人提及該看法，區再指「所有被告問我都係咁講架啦，由返當事人公開嘅言行去決定，我只係有資格去評論我同佢嘅交流」，並確認他在場下，沒聽過彭向其他人表示會無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審，至現時為止，鄭達鴻、梁國雄、吳政亨、余慧明、楊雪盈及彭卓棋6人已完成盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（10日）踏入審訊第23天。區諾軒續接受九龍西何啟明及劉偉聰盤問，區同意在九西首次協調會議，否決預算案的議題僅由戴耀廷「單向」介紹，而在第二次會議除張崑陽和岑子杰外，其他人沒有就此表態，最終各區亦沒有就否決財案達成共識，承認會議上有「分歧」。區又形容，何啟明所屬的民協為溫和的傳統民主派，亦「從來沒有看李伯盧（吳政亨）為（初選）組織者的一部分」，吳聞言微笑。至於自辯的劉偉聰，指出他並無如區所言出席第二次會議，區指不排除記憶有錯，但已盡力記憶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意首次九西協調會議-否決預算案議題不獲關注&quot;&gt;區同意首次九西協調會議 否決預算案議題不獲關注&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何啟明的大律師阮偉明進行盤問，指出何啟明首次出現在本案中，是在2020年3月24日九龍西首次協調會議，當時會議主要討論協調機制，包括誰可參選、預計勝出議席等，戴耀廷曾提及否決財政預算案，但該議題沒有得到任何關注，會後亦沒有達成任何共識，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阮續指，第二次協調會議於4月29日舉行，是在戴耀廷發表〈真攬炒十步〉一文的翌日，惟焦點仍在協調機制，區同意。阮再指，當時張崑陽曾提及戴的文章，戴並因此作出回應，但此外其他人士對該議題不感興趣，區同意，並補充岑子杰曾提出質疑，但「除此之外就冇其他嘅嘢啦」，之後亦沒有第三次協調會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;初稿提否決預算案僅戴耀廷單向介紹-除岑子杰張崑陽外無人表態&quot;&gt;初稿提否決預算案僅戴耀廷「單向」介紹 除岑子杰張崑陽外無人表態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒同意，戴耀廷首次會議準備的「35+計劃」文件，提及初選機制，但沒有觸及否決預算案。而在首次會議後，戴曾向與會者發出「35+立會過半計劃 民主派九西協調機制（初稿）」文件，該文件加入會運用權力否決預算案的條文，但區不知道戴是否實際上有發給所有人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指根據該初稿，似乎否決預算案的議題曾在首次會議提及，但問區，事實上是否不曾有任何相關討論？區指「我只能夠話戴耀廷介紹嘅時候有講過」。阮再指，事實上相關議題只是「單向」地由戴耀廷介紹，而非與會者之間有「討論」，區稱：「既然冇其他人回應，咁其實都係一種單向性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問，初稿在與會者間傳閱後，有沒有人就否決預算案提出反對。區指「就我憶述，就冇其他人對呢個文件有特別嘅討論」，亦「冇特別有人提出反對」。李運騰續指，一般開會議程均會通過前一次會議的紀錄，惟區指，九西第二次會議並無相關程序，並再重提該次會議「最鮮明」反對否決預算案是岑子杰，他指社民連支持全民退休保障，此外「我冇記得其他人講其他嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區早前亦稱，張崑陽在會上表示支持財政預算案，辯方續問，能否說會上沒有人同意張崑陽的說法，亦沒有人反對岑的說法？區再謂：「我諗只能夠話大家都冇表態囉。」他確認，當天會議何啟明、劉偉聰、馮達浚、黃碧雲與毛孟靜助理都有出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區確認協調會議共識不包括否決預算案69才達成協議&quot;&gt;區確認協調會議共識不包括否決預算案、6.9才達成協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就協調會議的共識，區重申各區會議最終達成4項共識，包括同意舉行初選、目標議席、替補機制及會舉辦初選論壇，其中九龍西目標贏4席，但打算投票後再決定出選名單數量。辯方續指，上述4項共識並不包括否決預算案，區指「的確喺會議之間係有分歧」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒早前供稱，戴耀廷於6月9日初選記者會前，曾在組織者群組發出各區協調機制文件，內有「會積極運用／會運用」權力否決預算案的字眼。辯方再問該些文件是否理應代表由戴耀廷達成的共識，但明顯地參與者就否決預算案一點沒有達成共識，區表示，只能說戴發出該些檔案後「呢啲檔案被視為共識」。阮偉明續指，6月9日初選記者會談及初選機制細節，能否說當天才就35+達成協議？區答：「可以咁講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指從無視李伯盧為初選組織者一部分&quot;&gt;區諾軒指從無視「李伯盧」為初選組織者一部分&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阮偉明其後就不同概念着區澄清。就「攬炒」，區同意民主派的光譜廣闊，故不同人對「攬炒」有不同理解。就「墨落無悔」聲明，區指與任何協調會議的討論結果「完全無關」，只是因應戴耀廷於6月9日記者會表示參與者毋須簽署共同綱領，所衍生的結果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於戴耀廷撰文提及立會過半是「大殺傷力憲制武器」，區指戴案發期間持續使用該字眼形容其主張，惟區本人從未講過相關字眼。區續稱，根據《基本法》第49至52條，立法會的確「有一套好完整嘅機制」處理立會與特首之間的關係，包括否決財政預算案後解散立法會及特首須辭職，而戴於文章亦清楚解釋該權力，並「說成是武器」。李運騰追問區「武器」的意思，是攻擊性（attacking）或防禦性（defending），區指應採納文章就此方面的解釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後欲就「三投三不投」運動作盤問，李運騰指區與該運動無關，惟辯方指區是初選組織者。李續問，區有否以任何形式參與「三投三不投」，區表示沒有，而且「我從來沒有看李伯盧（吳政亨網名）為組織者的一部分」，吳政亨聞言微笑，握緊右拳往下輕輕一振。法官再問，是否即不視吳政亨為「35+」組織者，區再答「正確」，吳政亨望向鄒家成笑及戚眉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒形容民協不止是傳統民主派-更站在較溫和位置&quot;&gt;區諾軒形容民協不止是傳統民主派 更站在較溫和位置&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問，區諾軒作為初選組織者，是否盡力確保初選合法，區諾軒指「我的確盡過最大嘅努力」，並就辯方提出的《個人資料（私隱）條例》、《選舉條例》、社交距離有關法例及《基本法》，「我都記得我有唔同嘅措施，嘗試努力地避免唔同嘅法律風險」，惟組織初選時尚未訂立《國安法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最後，區確認與何啟明認識，但二人並不相熟，並知悉何為民協成員。被問及是否將民協歸類為傳統民主派，區形容「佢哋不單係傳統嘅民主派，更加係企喺較為溫和嘅一部分」，並憶述他與民協「最緊密的合作」就是關注領展議題，強調公屋資產私有化是民生問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後輪到自辯的大律師劉偉聰，法官陳慶偉問他希望最先或最後進行盤問（「“Do you wish to go first or go last?”」），劉回應指「我希望現在開始盤問（“I wish to go now.”）」，引起眾人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 大律師 劉偉聰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒在盤問下，確認案發時他與劉只知道對方的名字，而劉有出席首次九龍西協調會議，亦記得劉曾在會上關注初選因局限某些人參選，故性質有「不民主」之處。劉續指，區曾稱他有參與第二次會議，惟事實上他並無參與當天會議。區指「我只會話我係憑住我嘅記憶去作供」，法官李運騰問區是否同意劉的說法，抑或他亦不肯定，區指「我的確冇更加多嘅證據話佢係有出席，如果我真係錯嘅，我好歡迎大家否定」，多名被告發笑。李運騰再問區是否可能記錯，區指不排除這個可能，「但我已經盡全力去記憶整件事嘅經過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰指直至控方提供方收到協調機制初稿-區稱相關檔案是戴耀廷視為共識&quot;&gt;劉偉聰指直至控方提供方收到協調機制初稿 區稱相關檔案是戴耀廷視為「共識」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就區諾軒稱，戴耀廷在會後將九西協調機制初稿發送給與會者，劉偉聰問有沒有可能戴沒有發送予所有人。區指只知道戴會後發給與會人士，但無參與整個過程，無法知道是否每人都「妥為傳達」，並在法官陳仲衡提問下，指他無收到任何與會者投訴指無收到文件。劉偉聰續指，其實直至控方向他提供，他一直無收到該份文件。李運騰問區能否確認劉收到該份文件？區重申只知道戴當時有將文件發送，惟不肯定是否有送達予劉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉偉聰續問及，區指6月9日記者會前戴耀廷向組織者傳送的協調機制檔案「被視為共識」，問是誰視之為共識？區說是「戴耀廷當時視之為共識」，林卓廷等發笑。區並同意，到了第二次會議，組織者及與會者並無就此作進一步討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰指35和35公民投票為兩個概念&quot;&gt;劉偉聰指「35+」和「35+公民投票」為兩個概念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉偉聰其後指，區諾軒在證供多次提及「35+」和「35+公民投票」，兩者其實是不同的概念，前者指立會過半的政治願景，後者指2020年7月11及12日的投票，區同意「的確可以有兩個概念」。區亦同意，初選可被視為泛民主派內的比賽，爭取出線在正式選舉參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉盤問結束後，向區表示：「祝你在將來的聆訊順利。（“I wish you the best in your future proceedings.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（10日）踏入審訊第23天。區諾軒接受代表民主黨黃碧雲和林卓廷的大狀盤問，同意與戴耀廷就初選目標有分歧，他的「初心」只是協調民主派爭取立會過半，惟戴耀廷則較着重運用否決權，亦承認組織者對如何爭五大訴求「傾唔到一個有效嘅策略」。被問是否同意將否決權與「35+」綑綁，區承認「終歸冇反對」，指當時未立《國安法》，「我的確冇為意到當時候呢一啲嘅主張，係會觸犯法例。」區又同意，民主黨在「墨落無悔」發布後，仍維持不會無差別否決預算案的立場，他亦不知道林卓廷和黃碧雲有否收到相關協調機制文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區辦初選初心協調民主派爭立會過半組織者無有效策略爭五大訴求&quot;&gt;區辦初選初心協調民主派爭立會過半、組織者無有效策略爭五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文下午盤問區諾軒。沈先指出，區諾軒曾在盤問期間提及「初心」一詞，並指追問35+計劃的真正目標非常重要，因為這解釋了許多人在2020年3月至7月的反應及行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈其後指出，有關「35+計劃」的真正目標，有一條重要的分界線，就是該計劃僅關乎泛民在立會選舉作協調，以免浪費選票，而非關注立會過半後會做什麼，區回應「呢個係我初心」。法官陳仲衡指出，「35+」亦要求參與者認同「五大訴求」，區形容是「環境使然」，因當時正值反修例運動，五大訴求是民主派爭取的訴求，但他同意辯方指，要求認同五大訴求事實上也只是像口號或願景一樣，沒有如何達成的實質計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，本案謀劃根本的難處，在於一方面望有越多民主派參與越好，但同時參與者光譜非常廣闊，要落實達成五大訴求的計劃幾乎不可能，區同意。沈續指，因此組織者辦「35+」，純粹集中於透過協調取得立會過半。區同意此為初選「最基本的目標」，至於取得過半後如何爭取五大訴求，組織者「的確傾唔到一個有效嘅策略去應對呢個問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱與戴耀廷立場差異-區望爭民主派最大勝算戴着重運用憲制權力&quot;&gt;區稱與戴耀廷立場差異 區望爭民主派最大勝算、戴着重運用憲制權力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文問及，組織者無法達成共識，是在計劃開始前，抑或在整個35+過程發生？區諾軒指在謀劃開始前，即使是最初的飯局，「哪怕戴耀廷嗰陣已經有講佢對於否決預算案嘅睇法」，但其他與會者亦只關心如何增加民主派最大勝算；而之後接觸不同持分者，因當時有許多新晉政治人物、不知道他們想法，故協調會議上「唔同人都有唔同嘅睇法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，因此在35+計劃開始前，組織者對立會過半後如何爭取五大訴求並沒有達成共識？區回應：「起碼我同戴耀廷好清楚睇到我哋係有立場上嘅差異」，並指「我哋嘅共識就係去搞初選」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問該差異的意思，區解釋對戴耀廷來說，「一開始佢就好着重關於憲制上面點樣去運用權力」，包括否決預算案，並在文章鮮明表達；但區在整件事行進期間，「我嘅行為係說明得好清楚，我係要去做協調，我係要去爭取民主派最大勝算。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指否決預算案爭議於4月尾出現-惟同意有參與者無表態&quot;&gt;區指否決預算案爭議於4月尾出現 惟同意有參與者無表態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒同意，在籌辦初選早期，約3月至4月中，大部分參與者對否決預算案和如何落實五大訴求均不感興趣。雖然九東首次協調會議於3月2日舉行，但當時作為試點，「傾得掂初選機制，已經係難能可貴」，否決權議題「當時只係佢（戴耀廷）一個人喺度講」。直至4月尾至5月，部分協調會議出現「風向轉變」，包括4月29日第二次九西會議、及5月5日第二次新東會議，會上才就是否否決預算案作爭拗。但區同意，上述兩次會議均沒有達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續問，即使風向改變，當時是否仍有人對該議題無興趣？區同意「的確有相當人士冇興趣參與當中討論」。法官一度提及，「冇興趣」可指同意但無發聲、不同意但無發聲、或完全不感興趣，區同意，並指各參與者是「冇講嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區確認最初35文件無提否決預算案冇違反我初心&quot;&gt;區確認最初35+文件無提否決預算案、「冇違反我初心」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文其後展示「35+計劃」的文件，指「35+」的「初心」化成該文件。主控周天行一度指，區說的「初心」是指他個人的初心，並非「35+」的初心，法官李運騰表示他們理解，法官陳慶偉亦指，區辦初選的「初心」，狹義來說只是爭取民主派立會過半，與戴耀廷的「初心」不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區確認，該份文件曾向所有與會者傳閱，而他與戴耀廷發出前，均知悉及認同該內容，「佢（戴）製作呢份文件，而我都完全同意。」沈續指，文件標題「有選民參與的民主派立法會選舉協調機制」，已清晰反映「35+」目標，並問文件內容是否「反映你（區諾軒）的初心，而不是戴耀廷的初心」？區答「我能夠講冇違反我初心」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，戴在區的初心以外，還想利用立會過半來否決預算案，不過該主張沒有在「35+計劃」文件出現。沈遂問，參加者會否因此理解初選目標只是爭取立會過半？區指視乎他們接收的訊息，「你話係早期嘅訊息，又或者係呢份（「35+計劃」）文件嘅訊息，固然仍在我初心之中」，林卓廷和吳政亨等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區認無鮮明反對戴耀廷主張未立國安法的確冇為意會觸犯法例&quot;&gt;區認無鮮明反對戴耀廷主張：未立《國安法》，的確冇為意會觸犯法例&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續問，區諾軒是否一直都反對戴耀廷在「35+」的政治議程，區指「我冇認同佢理念」，但後來戴耀廷在很多記者會「不斷講關於否決權嘅講法，我亦都冇喺嗰啲時候作出鮮明嘅反對」。陳慶偉續問，那能否說區同意將否決權與35+計劃綑綁？區指「我終歸冇反對到呢樣嘢，因為當時候的確未立《國安法》，我的確冇為意到當時候呢一啲嘅主張，係會觸犯法例」，又指他亦「誤解咗」，因以他對《基本法》的理解，否決權是行使憲制上的權利。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴耀廷積極用權說法迎合不同意見予不遵行的空間&quot;&gt;區：戴耀廷「積極」用權說法迎合不同意見、予不遵行的空間&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文其後展示區諾軒錄影會面謄本，提及某次協調會議後，他曾向戴耀廷及趙家賢反映兩個政黨的意見，並指他們作為初選主事者，「冇理由唔理唔同人嘅睇法而去表達一個咁激進立場」，戴回應認為「積極運用《基本法》權力否決預算案」能給予政治團體或參與者「唔去遵行」、「唔去否決嘅空間」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒在盤問下表示，與二人會面是在5月5日的第二次新東協調會議後進行，當時民主黨、社民連、街工都有表示不同意否決預算案，會議前社民連黃浩銘亦曾着他勿答應會否決預算案。區說，「既然人哋託付我，我就要將呢個意見講畀戴耀廷聽」，並略帶激動指：「因為喺呢件事之前，佢（戴耀廷）已經不斷喺報章出文啦，甚至令我感覺到脫離咗一啲參與者嘅睇法啊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在錄影會面又解釋，戴主張「積極」一字是作為「大家討論嘅平衡點」，說法同時包含「可以不遵行否決財政預算案呢個承諾」。區確認，重申戴耀廷提「積極運用權力」的意思，是「你可以用，你可以唔用，但若果政府唔聽呢個意見，我就會行使呢個憲制權力」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，戴是以此迎合兩派陣營意見，包括望運用否決權的一方，及望保留彈性、視乎預算案內容才決定是否否決的一方，並同意戴是試圖告訴人們有空間可不運用否決權。沈士文其後指，戴耀廷沒有提及「積極」字眼是任何會議的共識，區同意「的確冇任何選區達成呢個共識」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱戴耀廷用否決權論述屬演進&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱戴耀廷用否決權論述屬「演進」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰其後就戴耀廷對否決權想法的時序發問。區同意，戴於2019年12月的文章首次提及立會過半後行使否決權，但並非很確切的說法；其後3月26日，與初選記者會同日舉行的港島區首次會議，戴提倡運用否決權但遭司馬文反對；戴其後不斷提倡在文件加入「會積極運用」權力否決預算案字眼，並鑒於其他區亦加了相關字眼，在不遲於5月4日第三次九東會議，將相關字眼加入九東文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，按此時序，會否同意運用否決權是戴耀廷持續（consistent）的主張，區指不會用 consistent 來形容，而是會用「evolvement（演進）」形容，指戴在2019年12月的文章僅提出運用憲制權力的可能性，至於談及特首下台的相關步驟，是在3月31日〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉一文才出現。不過區同意，直至他錄影會面上提及的5月5日會面，戴耀廷仍然解釋採用「積極運用權力」是作為「大家討論嘅平衡點」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;胡志偉曾稱憂政黨利用初選綑綁民主黨-惟墨落無悔後仍維持立場&quot;&gt;胡志偉曾稱憂政黨利用初選綑綁民主黨 惟「墨落無悔」後仍維持立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒曾提及，「墨落無悔」聲明發布後情況有變。沈士文就此發問，區確認「墨落無悔」發布後，黃之鋒曾主動詢問他民主黨對聲明的回應，坐在延伸庭的黃聞言與譚凱邦及馮達浚交談。區並確認，當時回覆黃3點，包括他並無與任何民主黨成員確認；預計民主黨不會同意聲明；及民主黨已表明不會無差別否決財政預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區補充，他在與黃之鋒會面前，曾與民主黨主席胡志偉會面，重申胡當時憂慮將有更多非官方聲明出現，擔心其他政黨或團體會利用初選將民主黨綑綁、令該黨受制肘；又指該黨過往立場，是對政府議案開設新的人事職位大多有保留，因為「易請難送」，但若政府要「起醫院、起學校」，無理由要否決預算案。但區同意，即使「墨落無悔」發布後民主黨被游說，但該黨依然維持上述立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方引區論文指民主黨為傳統民主派-區稱不知道黃林曾否收協調文件&quot;&gt;辯方引區論文指民主黨為傳統民主派 區稱不知道黃、林曾否收協調文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文其後提到，區諾軒曾就傳統及激進民主派的差別進行研究，該論文在今年發表，名為〈Cooperate but divided at heart: Analysis of an opposition elite survey during autocratization〉。區確認文章中，黃碧雲被歸類為傳統民主派，民主黨亦被歸類為傳統民主政黨，並指出傳統民主派比激進民主派「較親中（pro-mainland）」，民主化手法亦「較溫和（moderate）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區亦確認，黃碧雲及林卓廷2020年時為立法會議員，而二人分別從未出席九龍西及新界東的任何一次協調會議，均為其代表出席。沈士文問區是否知道戴耀廷有否將協調機制文件送達二人，區表示不知道新界東的情況，至於九龍西，戴耀廷曾告知他在首次會議後有將文件發放給與會者，惟他不知道戴實際上有否發放。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件押至下周二（14日）下午續審，沈士文表示預計當天能完成盤問。至現時為止，鄭達鴻、梁國雄、吳政亨、余慧明、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰8人已完成盤問區諾軒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表吳政亨和余慧明的大律師石書銘今繼續盤問區諾軒。區在盤問下，確認他過去10年在香港民主運動有較投入的角色，他2009年、即22歲時加入民主黨，2014年前亦曾參與「左翼21」活動，形容該組織是一班有志於社會公平分配的年青人，開讀書會、關心時事和政府政策。他確認，他於中文大學修讀政治與行政學系學士和碩士，專攻比較政治和公共政策，並於東京大學修讀公共政策博士，研究亞洲全民退休保障，他亦曾於香港城市大學專上學院任客席講師。法官陳慶偉一度質疑問題不相關，惟石書銘指望就引發35+的民主運動背景發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於政治參與，區確認於2011年當選南區區議員，2012和2016年參選立法會議員，並在香港民主運動活躍，曾於2017年任民間人權陣線召集人，並曾兩度參選民主黨主席，並於2018年補選當選立法會議員，但任期只有1年9個月，其後被終審法院取消資格。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，根據其學術背景及政治參與，他對香港追求政治改革的歷程非常熟悉亦有親身參與，而「35+」計劃建立一套民主派協調機制，亦是香港漫長政改歷史的其中一章。區同意，初選協調機制是因應比例代表制的制度建立，而民主派每屆都是「多票、少議席」。石書銘續問，對泛民主派來說，要求普選是否有《基本法》的基礎，惟法官李運騰質疑，區能否代其他人回答，法官陳慶偉亦提醒石只是代表吳政亨和余慧明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘表示明白，惟欲就初選的脈絡發問。陳慶偉指，「我們對香港的政治運動歷史沒有興趣，我們只對本案控罪有興趣。（“We are not interested in the political history movement in Hong Kong, we are only interested in the charge.”）」石指控罪只能在政治的背景下理解，陳慶偉指他明白，「我們不需要你教」，李運騰亦指石書銘的問題在主問已觸及，可直接問其他問題。石書銘指尚有許多細節未觸及，望能提供一個完整的圖畫，惟陳慶偉再着石直接發問，又指法庭不需區諾軒就香港的政治改革講課（“We don’t need a lecture from him on political reform in Hong Kong.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒同意35是政改延續-官再打斷發問指不應倡政治主張&quot;&gt;區諾軒同意35+是政改延續 官再打斷發問指不應倡政治主張&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘續問，35+是否以往民主派追求政治改革的延續，區同意。石再問，直至2019年，民主派陣營是否已對政改進程感到挫敗，法官李運騰再打斷，指區只能代表自己說話，法官陳慶偉亦着石「不要利用法律程序作為政治平台（“Do not use this proceeding as a political platform.”）」。石遂改問區曾否與其他團體討論，惟陳慶偉再指問題太空泛。石書銘重申，本案核心無可避免觸及政治議題（“The crux of the matter in this case inevitably touches on political issues.”），他不是要以此作為政治平台。陳慶偉表示明白，但指其盤問有限度，重申不應以此為平台提倡任何政治主張，並駁回其問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘指他並非提倡任何政治主張，並改問為何區諾軒及戴耀廷等組織者推動35+。惟陳慶偉再指區已在主問答過該問題，即望為民主派建立協調機制。石再問有否其他原因，惟陳慶偉打斷着他問下一條問題。李運騰指石如想提出其他原因可以指出，石回應想問開放式問題，惟陳慶偉不准他繼續發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒同意五大訴求概念含糊-組織者冇清楚傾過定義&quot;&gt;區諾軒同意五大訴求概念「含糊」 組織者「冇清楚傾過」定義&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒其後在盤問下，同意35+的性質是要爭取立會過半，向政府問責並要求政府回應公眾訴求，而以上兩項都是當時社會所缺乏的。他亦認為，當時初選組織者和參與者都有過相關看法，並主動提及他2020年4月30日在《蘋果日報》的訪問，指當時有兩種聲音，一邊是支持攬炒和否決財政預算案；另一邊是要爭取立法會過半，以增加談判空間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就區在訪問提到藉35+爭「五大訴求」，石書銘指五大訴求是否即「撤回《逃犯條例》修訂」、「成立獨立調查委員會」、「撤回暴動定性」、「特赦被捕者」及「爭取雙普選」，區同意，並指尚有另外兩點，包括「相關政府官員為警暴負責」，及「林鄭月娥下台」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，是否即除了五大訴求，還有另外的訴求，區指這是當時他聽到的訴求，並同意法官陳慶偉指，五大訴求的概念「的確係含糊嘅」，「因為呢啲訴求有時有，有時冇。」李運騰指他不太明白，問五大訴求其實是否有多於五個訴求？此時施德來點頭，陳志全亦發笑。區否認，指當時社會輿論的確不斷講五大訴求，「至於係邊五個，唔同人有唔同講法」，林卓廷亦邊笑邊點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，「五大訴求」是35+目標，初選組織者曾否定義五大訴求，區指「的確冇清楚傾過，但係喺嗰七樣嘢裡面」，並同意李運騰指，「五大訴求」是像「口號」一樣。陳仲衡續問，是否若不具體定義何謂「五大訴求」，便可取悅所有想要「五大訴求」的人，區確認「當時嘅公眾討論的確係咁嘅情況」。李運騰又形容，是否即如聖誕樹，想掛什麼上去都可以？此時被告大笑，區並稱「都離唔開呢七條樹枝」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒其後在石書銘盤問下，同意林鄭月娥下台與爭取雙普選兩訴求有較多「可取代性」；而要求政府官員為警暴負責亦與要求獨立調查委員會查警暴相似，兩者實是「五大訴求」的另一種演繹方式。石書銘其後欲再問，35+計劃如何落實區提及的目標，惟再被陳慶偉要求問下一條問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官稱對辯方盤問感困惑-提醒應與案相關&quot;&gt;官稱對辯方盤問感困惑 提醒應與案相關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;小休後，法官陳仲衡表示對石書銘的盤問感到困惑（puzzled），法官李運騰指，看不到辯方問題與控罪或余慧明角色的相關性，又指若石書銘不作解釋，難以容許他繼續發問。石書銘指控罪與被告取得立會過半的「非法手段」相關，惟李運騰強調，控方案情不僅談及取得立會過半，而是指被告串謀目標是「無差別」否決預算案。石書銘指，故希望理解初選組織者的看法和如何理解否決預算案，惟李運騰提醒，他只是代表吳政亨和余慧明，而吳並沒有盤問，着他只集中在自己的當事人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰又指，若石書銘認為35+計劃不違法，則應向證人指出，又指石是在兜圈，並非處理35+的合法性問題，望他能善用法庭時間。法官陳慶偉其後問，石在結案陳詞希望有什麼陳述，石回應望指出整個「攬炒」的概念並非控方所指的「非法手段」及可「顛覆國家政權」。李運騰質疑證人是否可回答相關問題，陳慶偉亦多次問石期望證人回答什麼，石指望區回答就舉辦初選的想法，以說出初選的脈絡（context），惟陳慶偉指該說法太過空泛（hollow）。石解釋，望證人就初選的合法性作供，法官重申問題必須相關和集中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KiqgAHb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（9日）踏入審訊第22天。區諾軒續接受盤問，表示認為《基本法》精神是政府和立法會「互諒互讓」，他亦曾期望立會透過談判與政府解決反修例風波；並將「攬炒」一派歸結為「不斷透過施壓要求政府妥協」，意指「你唔合作，我都唔合作囉」。辯方問及，抗爭派曾否表示若政府回應五大訴求，便不會否決預算案，區表示無相關資訊，又指除非與被告有私交，否則「我唔係一個適當嘅角色去評論人（立場）」。辯方再問激進陣營是否以否決權作籌碼，區指政治人物通常都會實行所說的事，「不過當然都有啲政治人物話，『我講吓咋喎』」，法官和被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指基本法精神是政府與立會互諒互讓-曾期望透過談判解決反修例風波&quot;&gt;區指《基本法》精神是政府與立會「互諒互讓」 曾期望透過談判解決反修例風波&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表吳政亨和余慧明的大律師石書銘今繼續盤問區諾軒。石書銘就戴耀廷2019年12月的〈立會奪半，走向真普選重要一步〉一文發問，提及「立會奪半若能成功，最重要的不是能直接改變香港制度的本質，而是令立法會轉變為一個守護香港核心價值的重要堡壘」，問區諾軒作為初選組織者，當時是否抱持同樣看法，區指「我的確認同過呢篇文章，所以先開始同戴耀廷合作」。石問區為何認同，惟法官陳慶偉指與案無關，石解釋與本案串謀的目標相關，惟遭陳打斷並着他問下一條問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘其後引文中提及，「立法會最強大的力量是財政權 ⋯⋯ 因此，民主派在立法會奪半，應可運用立法會的財政權，迫使特區政權在運用公共資源上考慮公民的真正需要。」區同意戴耀廷於2020年1月的飯局提及該觀點。石其後就立法會議員向政府議案提出修訂的權力發問，惟再遭法官陳慶偉多番打斷指不相關。區其後確認，議員提出私人條例草案需要政府同意，議員亦不能對財政預算案提出修訂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒曾受訪指，當時對35+有兩種想像，分別是支持攬炒和否決財政預算案，及爭取立會過半以增加談判空間。石書銘續問，立會過半是否讓議員可增加與政府談判的空間，讓政府回應民生議題？區解釋，《基本法》第49至52條詳細談及關於立法會與政府處理財政預算案的機制，他一直對條文的解讀，是「當中嘅精神，其實就係政府同立法會大家，互相互諒互讓」，並在出現分歧時透過談判處理。區並舉例他任立法會議員時，曾就預算案與施政報告等與特首或財政司司長會面，形容「一個良好嘅政治制度，應該要做到呢一點」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，若沿着該談判空間的思路發展下去，「我的確曾經期望過，新選出嚟嘅立法會，會同政府一齊透過談判解決反修例風波。」惟區亦指出，「攬炒論嗰一派係另一種睇法，我會歸結為不斷透過施壓，要求政府妥協。」他並指，該兩種看法，在多年民主運動亦有出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問向政府施壓是否仍有討論空間-區舉人力社民連例子稱視乎情況&quot;&gt;辯方問向政府施壓是否仍有討論空間 區舉人力社民連例子稱視乎情況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘續指，無論談判或施壓其實都是一體兩面，法官陳慶偉着他留待陳詞再述，又指「我知道你不喜歡這個答案」，惟石回應他其實喜歡該答案。石續問，區提及有陣營不斷施壓要求政府妥協，但是否仍有討論空間？區舉例，以往人民力量和社民連均被歸類為較激進的政團，並在政府是否派錢的議題上以拉布爭取訴求，對施政構成影響，惟其後政府決定直接派錢予市民後，他們亦決定停止拉布，「所以一切都係要睇情況而定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問及，直至初選論壇，是否仍然有該兩個陣營存在，區指「相信總有候選人係可以歸類喺兩個陣營裡面嘅」，但認為仍要視乎他們當時言行，才會有較公允評價。石書銘續問，那對較激進陣營來說，若政府回應五大訴求，是否便不必然否決預算案。控方質疑問題屬揣測、區無法回答，法官陳仲衡亦指論壇上沒有相關言論，其問題充滿假設性，陳慶偉亦重申「籠統的問題只會換來籠統的答案」，亦沒有證案價值。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指認為並非適當角色評論被告立場&quot;&gt;區諾軒指認為並非適當角色評論被告立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，區諾軒其實已回答了石的問題，即視乎各人言行。區同意，並指「呢幾日因為⋯⋯我相信嚟緊都會有唔少嘅辯方律師，會問我佢哋嘅當事人究竟係咪持守某個立場，我越諗越覺得，我唔係一個適當嘅角色去評論人，除非我同佢有私交，而可以提供到佢嘅諗法畀法庭」，何桂藍一度露齒笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘再問，以區觀察，是否同意有激進陣營的參與者以否決權作為籌碼，區答：「政治人物通常都係講乜嘢就實行啲乜嘢，不過當然都有啲政治人物話，『我講吓咋喎』，所以呢個問題真係好難答」，法官陳慶偉隨即發笑，多名被告包括鄭達鴻、林卓廷、余慧明和鄒家成等也忍俊不禁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問有否抗爭派稱若回應五大訴求就不否決財案-區稱無相關資訊&quot;&gt;辯方問有否抗爭派稱若回應五大訴求就不否決財案 區稱無相關資訊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘再問，區曾否聽過激進陣營表示若政府回應五大訴求，他們或不會否決預算案，區指「始終係未發生嘅事」，又指「若果有人真係咁講，我哋就要相信囉」。法官陳仲衡補充，據庭上播放的片段，曾否有任何抗爭派人士表達過相關看法，區指看不到相關片段，「好難話呢個可能出嚟」，又指「我嘅難處的確係，當事人冇特別咁講，佢又冇同我私交」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問及，那區在不公開的協調會議曾否聽過抗爭派人士有相關說法，區則重申，雖然戴耀廷有提及「會積極運用」等字眼，但3至4月的氛圍尚未去到討論是否否決預算案，並指「的確冇人係喺嗰個時候特登講話如果政府做啲乜，我就唔用（否決權）啦。」李運騰再問，那在其他任何場合，區有否聽過任何抗爭派人士提過相關說法，區再稱「我真係冇相關嘅資訊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱攬炒意思為你唔合作我都唔合作囉&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱「攬炒」意思為「你唔合作，我都唔合作囉」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘其後就「攬炒」發問，區同意「攬炒」意思為雙方互不讓步，導致雙方有損失。石其後引述2020年《立場》的戴耀廷訪問〈【選舉近了】面對 35+ 憧憬與「囚徒困境」 民主派有可能協調嗎？〉，提及2016年立法會選舉民主派名單數目創新高，卻導致「攬炒」局面：「前車可鑑，有沒可能避免因『囚徒困境』引致的『攬炒』結局？戴耀廷的構思，是辦一個『有公民參與的協調機制』⋯⋯」石指「攬炒」一詞亦用來形容2016年選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，上文「攬炒」涉及對象是民主派之間，問區〈真攬炒十步〉一文所涉對象為誰，區指是政府與民主派之間。陳續指「攬炒」的意思要視乎脈絡，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石續問，「攬炒」是否視乎雙方的互動，一方作出行為，另一方再回應。區解釋，「囚徒困境」中雙方合作能得益，「如果大家都唔合作，就係一種攬炒」，理解「攬炒」意思為「你唔合作，我都唔合作囉」。區並認為，35+中部分民主派若高舉「攬炒」，會解讀其動機是指「你唔合作，我都唔合作囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘一度再問，若指戴耀廷4月文章提及「攬炒」，是指若政府不回應五大訴求，泛民才拒絕合作，該說法是否公道，法官陳慶偉指他應問戴耀廷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QUCBsCr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（9日）踏入審訊第22天。區諾軒繼續接受盤問，法官李運騰臨散庭前表示，對本案進度非常關注，指他於9月底需處理另一宗案件，惟本案自開審後24天，仍在處理首名控方證人的盤問。大部分辯方律師均認為，原定的90天足夠完成雙方案情，自辯的劉偉聰亦指感到樂觀，指他自被捕後每天也樂觀地生活，其中鄒家成、施德來、黃碧雲和林卓廷擬作供。法官陳慶偉指，若計及相關法律爭議、求情和裁決等，料審訊或需延至聖誕節。翻查資料，黎智英及《蘋果日報》3間公司涉勾結外國勢力案定於9月底開審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官關注審訊進度-指同意事實除首5段外均需舉證&quot;&gt;法官關注審訊進度 指同意事實除首5段外均需舉證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今繼續接受盤問，臨散庭前，法官就案件進度與雙方商討。法官李運騰表示，對案件進度感到非常關注，指現時已是審訊第20多天，惟仍在處理首名控方證人，並只是第二名辯方律師進行盤問。他並指，他9月底有另一宗案件要處理，今早亦推遲了一宗原定8月開審的謀殺案，並向律師索取未來兩年日程，因他不認為本案能於8月初完成（“I see no prospect of this case finishing in early August.”）。翻查資料，壹傳媒創辦人黎智英與《蘋果日報》3間公司被控「串謀勾結外國勢力」等罪，原定今年9月25日開審，李運騰為該案主審法官之一，本案主控周天行亦為該案主控。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰要求控方估計審訊需時多久，周天行指，現時尚餘3名被告證人，至於其餘為程序而需要傳召的證人（formal witness），則視乎雙方同意的事實。控辯雙方早前讀出4份同意事實，當中黃碧雲、林卓廷和何桂藍同意的部分較少。李運騰指陳仲衡製作了比較列表，除了頭5段，幾乎其餘的段落均需控方舉證。法官陳慶偉指尚有逾100名證人，被告席傳來「吓」，控方確認名單上有100名證人，但希望其他證人證供能「相對上」較短。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，「相對」是一個相對的概念，李運騰亦笑指，一百年「相對上」較一千年為短，控方說法對法庭無甚幫助，問控方有否較實際的估計。陳慶偉指控方不可能有「實際的估計」，只能有「大概的估計（guesstimate）」，又問能否於聖誕前完成審訊，被告發笑。李運騰並指，法庭的底線是不希望押後續審（part heard），周天行回應，認為審訊能於8月前完成。李運騰其後指辯方或有更好的估算，並逐一問辯方的看法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施德來黃碧雲林卓廷及鄒家成或作供&quot;&gt;施德來、黃碧雲、林卓廷及鄒家成或作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大部分辯方律師認為90日足夠雙方案情。代表吳政亨和余慧明的大律師石書銘指，就區諾軒的盤問只餘下5至10分鐘，盤問其他證人需2至3天，亦不預計會傳召辯方證人。代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀指，盤問區諾軒會於1小時完成；代表何啟明的大律師阮偉明亦指，就區諾軒的盤問會很簡短，亦不會傳召辯方證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表施德來的大律師黃廷光指，認為90日審期足夠，而施德來或會作供及傳召一名辯方證人，預計需時3日；代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文則指，區諾軒的證供是3名被告證人中最長，其餘的會較短，認為90日足夠，而黃林二人或會作供，料需時3日。代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑則指，鄒或會作供，但無法估計控方案情需時多久，因現時還在接收新的材料。代表柯耀林的大律師葉海琅指，或會傳召一至兩名證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉，及代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大律師黃宇逸，均認為90日足夠，黃宇逸並指盤問區諾軒只用了1.5天，預計其他證人會更短。自辯的劉偉聰則表示，「我感到樂觀，這也是我被捕後度過每天的方法（“I am optimistic, that’s how I live everyday since my arrest.”）」，認為90日足夠處理整宗案件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指計算裁決求情等-案件或於聖誕才能完成&quot;&gt;官指計算裁決求情等 案件或於聖誕才能完成&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過亦有辯方認為90日不足夠。代表楊雪盈的大律師張耀良認為控方過於樂觀，料在90日審期外尚需多20至30日，而他需時少於1小時盤問區諾軒。代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 指，會就「共謀者原則」作爭議，亦可能作中段陳詞，認為在90日審期外或需多10日進行法律爭議。代表李予信的大律師關文渭則指，預計會審至9月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰最後苦笑指，雙方似乎只認為90日只足夠完成雙方案情，惟他與主控周天行均須處理9月的案件，若屆時本案審訊未完，將會面對重大困難，又指不是希望責怪任何人，但望雙方均做好準備。法官陳慶偉則指，要處理所有證據、法律爭議、結案陳詞、求情及裁決等，案件或需延至聖誕才能完成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明天續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16人不認罪受審&quot;&gt;16人不認罪受審&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">辯方就區諾軒背景及民主運動提問 官多番打斷質疑無關、稱對政治運動歷史無興趣 辯方問政府若讓步抗爭派是否不一定否決財案 區：我唔係適當嘅角色評論 官關注審訊進度、料審至聖誕 鄒家成、林卓廷等4人擬作供</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Russian Imperial Action</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-09-russian-imperial-action.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Russian Imperial Action" /><published>2023-03-09T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-03-09T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/russian-imperial-action</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-09-russian-imperial-action.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russia’s inherently imperial motivations behind its decision to invade Ukraine and the approach to war have significant implications for Western support to Ukraine and the prospects for a just peace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the one-year anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s motivations for embarking on the conflict are worth reconsidering in light of the current strategic and operational environment in Ukraine. Although Russian propaganda – and those that enable it – falsely and unconvincingly claims that Russia’s genocidal war of choice was somehow a rational reaction to NATO enlargement, the Kremlin’s decision to commit to a full-scale invasion does reflect genuine (if illegitimate) security perceptions that are rooted in Moscow’s deeply imperial, and expansionist, strategic culture. This imperial identity is so central that the Russian leadership is content to suffer horrendous losses in Ukraine almost indefinitely, particularly when the human losses are primarily ‘expendable’ ethnic minority and penal populations, in the belief that Russian mass can outlast Ukrainian courage and Western arms. This prism is crucial for understanding the Kremlin’s rationale for launching its misbegotten war against Ukraine to begin with, but also to illuminate policy options for a just conclusion to the war and to win a stabler post-war architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-anxieties&quot;&gt;Strategic Anxieties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion in early 2022 was not primarily a means to punish perceived Ukrainian belligerence, to solidify its control over Donbas, to manifest Novorossiya, or even to conquer the entirety of Ukrainian territory, per se – though one or more of these may have been secondary or tertiary objectives. Instead, Russia’s invasion was a pre-emptive military action against the potential or even expected growth of Ukrainian power – which could dramatically curtail Russian power in the region – in the medium time horizon (2025–2030) or beyond. As such, in early 2022, Russia – seemingly at the height of its powers, while Ukrainian strength was yet to be fully realised – had ‘no choice’ but to move immediately to decapitate this budding and increasingly capable rival. This hypothesis, if true, helps to explain the apparent irrationality of the full-scale invasion and accounts for the Kremlin’s continued obstinance in persecuting its war despite extended setbacks and devastating attrition of its forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s motivations appear aligned with the so-called Thucydides Trap – the theorised tendency for a great power to make war based on worries over a competitor’s rise. In this case, the evident emergence of Ukrainian power threatened to upset Russia’s long-calibrated and painstakingly tended regional hegemony. In more practical terms, the combination of Ukraine’s basic strategic potential – a large Europeanising country of 40 million people, rich in natural resources, human capital and industrial strength – and the arc of its recent military and economic development meant that it would soon have the combat power and capabilities not only to threaten – if not entirely regain – its lost territories, but also to project power across the region and stymie Russia’s imperial pretensions in Eastern Europe. Imagine, for example, a Ukraine with an assortment of long-range munitions and cruise missiles that could threaten Russia’s most strategic assets in occupied Crimea, the Sea of Azov, Rostov-na-Don, Bryansk, Belarus and even further afield. Even without NATO membership, Ukraine possesses the latent power and potential to be a credible regional power with the ability to constrain Russian power, perhaps even radically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Kremlin’s operational obstinance is directly linked to its strategic goal of protecting and policing its imperial position at all costs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while Ukraine in 2022 was seen as having this potential, it was a potential yet unrealised and several years at least from basic viability. By contrast, Russia saw itself – and was largely (and incorrectly, as it turns out) regarded internationally – as being in peak military and strategic condition following years of high-budget modernisation and a seeming track record of successful, if more limited, military adventures in Georgia, eastern Ukraine and the Middle East. These dynamics appeared to present Moscow with an urgent but genuine window of opportunity to address the ‘Ukrainian question’ for the long term. This was why Russian negotiations and demands before the war appeared so outlandish; no tactical bargaining could address broader Russian strategic concerns. Only a diplomatic nonstarter like a return to a Cold War-era, Yalta-style paradigm that surrendered Ukraine and much of Eastern Europe to violent Russian revanchist colonialism might have addressed the Kremlin’s strategic anxieties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;operational-obstinance&quot;&gt;Operational Obstinance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewing Russia’s full-scale invasion from this perspective – as a decisive action in pursuit of a favourable imperial strategic equilibrium – also helps us understand the manner in which Russia has prosecuted its war in Ukraine even amid severe loss, territorial setbacks and general military exhaustion. After mostly abandoning early-phase efforts to employ RMA-style strikes relying on precision, mobility and battlespace awareness, the Russian military has reverted to funnelling human and material mass in pursuit of operational or even minor tactical objectives – at a breathtakingly grievous cost in casualties and materiel. While this approach is routinely derided in the analytical community as merely the ‘Russian way of war’, it speaks to a kind of desperation on the part of the Russian leadership to overwhelm and outlast the better-led, more purposeful and increasingly better-equipped Ukrainian armed forces. The Kremlin’s operational obstinance, in this sense, is directly linked to its strategic goal of protecting and policing its imperial position at all costs, including through broadly unpopular ‘partial’ mobilisations that harvest disproportionately non-ethnic Russian colonial populations and penal battalions for the meat grinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, an operational stalemate and even moderate, incremental gains by Ukrainian forces continue to benefit the Kremlin, despite evidence of material and moral exhaustion in the Russian military. The Russian political leadership is gambling that this exhaustion can be managed without leading to a general military or societal collapse, particularly through fresh injections of ‘expendable’ colonial and penal populations – while those in the physical and social imperial metropole are largely institutionally spared, or afforded egress to Georgia, Armenia, Turkey and elsewhere. Over time, this thinking suggests, Russian mass can and will overcome Ukrainian courage and Western arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If Russia’s leadership believes that time is on its side, anything approaching a just permanent settlement would be a concession too far&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian leadership’s gamble may or may not succeed, but in the interim it is certain to lead to extended death and destruction for both militaries and among ordinary Ukrainians. It also suggests that a Russian appetite for anything more comprehensive than ceasefire-as-operational-pause is unlikely, if not impossible, under such conditions. If Russia’s leadership believes that time is on its side – confident of Iranian and potentially Chinese equipment and the availability of virtually inexhaustible, ‘costless’ and ‘expendable’ colonial and penal populations – anything approaching a just permanent settlement is a concession too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;line-breakers&quot;&gt;Line Breakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has potentially significant implications for Western assistance to the Ukrainian war effort. Whether due to strategic caution or training and maintenance concerns, the flow of Western arms and military platforms has been largely incremental, lagging battlefield needs and varying in quality and quantity – not to mention variegated in make, origin and complexity. These deliveries have undoubtedly assisted Ukrainian combat power, but not yet necessarily decisively. The exceptions prove the rule: M777 howitzers, a common platform provided in volume and in relatively short order, offered the Ukrainians massed and long-armed fires that had an almost immediate effect; the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), though provided in smaller quantities, was a ‘line breaking’ precision platform that gave Ukrainian forces the premier capability in theatre to deliver exceptionally devastating ranged fire; and Starlink afforded Ukrainian forces a persistent, low-latency, high-bandwidth and relatively secure command and control and information network. The latter’s reported degradation by SpaceX, in turn, has sharply stymied Ukrainian counterattack and offensive operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar fashion, Western partners should provide Ukraine with additional platforms that can either afford superiority in high-volume, massed fires in quantity – even from simpler, tactical systems such as 120mm mortars – or line-breaking systems that can both facilitate breakthroughs and pose a conventional deterrent to Russian forces. Outfitting HIMARS with sufficient quantities of the Army Tactical Missile System’s (ATACMS) long-range strike capacity might fulfil this requirement, as it would threaten Russia’s staging, logistics and rally points deep behind its lines and render essential major facilities in Crimea, Belarus and even Russia vulnerable to Ukrainian counterstrike. The recently announced US provision of Ground-Launched Small-Diameter Bombs (GLSDBs) to Ukraine could fulfil a similar need, though it is unclear if they can be delivered in the time and quantity needed to make a near-term difference. Similarly, Typhoon, F-16, F/A-18 or other Western fourth-generation (or better) tactical aircraft could introduce game-changing dynamics – if and when they are fielded, and provided that they are supplied in sufficient numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve the conditions for a just peace, Ukraine urgently needs line-breaking capabilities in the near term – well before the six-month-plus horizon – as may be the case with GLSDBs, large numbers of main battle tanks, and almost certainly tactical fast-jet aircraft. ATACMS may be worthwhile in this regard, as would a means to accelerate deliveries of GLSDBs and other capabilities of the same type already in Western inventories, as well as large quantities of unmanned combat aerial vehicles and, of course, the full use of Starlink or a comparable system. While this would likely provoke a heightened Russian military response, it is precisely Ukraine’s ability to go on the offensive sustainably, shorten the kill chain and neutralise Russian military infrastructure that is most likely to force the conditions for a true and defensible peace agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

Assets are ageing but the operating environment in the UK is not conducive to large-scale investment, and without this it is likely that large portions of UK production capacity will cease to operate within a decade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most UK steel is made using blast furnaces, the technology with the highest CO2 emissions. This means the replacing of assets as they reach end of life will require investing in new low-emissions technologies with new supply chains, bringing new risks, to achieve climate change goals and avoid the risk of stranded assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper looks at risks relating to UK domestic steel production at a national level, starting with the role the industry currently plays in the resilience of the UK economy and what the implications of further reductions in steel production capability might be for national risk. It then assesses risks created in the alternative scenario where large-scale investments are made in low-emissions technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper concludes that the highest-risk pathway is the status quo and continued delay to investment in the sector. Although the UK is a major outlier in terms of the small size of its steel production, it has until now managed to maintain a notable presence in most product segments, which is important for the ongoing functioning and resilience of the economy. Further loss of capacity would leave segments of the economy entirely reliant on imports, in some cases from single international suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing heavily in steel assets comes with risks, however. The economic fundamentals of the sector are not sustainable, and a more level playing field with European competitors is required for a healthy industry that is not reliant on government support. Low-emissions technologies have risks, particularly when they rely heavily on one technology or supply chain across the industry. This paper identifies the supply of scrap steel and high-grade iron ore, the potential for major increases in gas demand in electric arc furnace steelmaking, and the effectiveness and competitiveness of carbon capture as risks that motivate an approach which encourages and supports multiple technologies. It argues that the cost to the UK as a whole of such an approach would likely be less than the cost of any significant disruption to the steel supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper assesses some of the national risks posed by the situation in the UK domestic steel industry, both from the status quo and moving forward through the energy transition. Steel is acknowledged by the UK government as a ‘foundation industry’ that is ‘vital for the UK’s manufacturing and construction sectors’. The material is widely used in household goods, critical national infrastructure (CNI) and communications, defence platforms, and medical, industrial and agricultural equipment. Secure supply is therefore strategically important to the functioning of UK society. Steel comes in many forms and grades, each with distinct chemical properties suited to specific applications. Some are used in massive volumes, while others have very specialist applications, making international trade important for efficient supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excess global production capacity can overshadow the varied role that domestic production in different product segments plays in supporting the wider economy and society. The dramatic reduction in the size of the UK domestic industry since 1970 can give the impression that UK steel producers are superfluous, particularly when they request significant backing from the public purse. But domestic producers provide a layer of resilience across the economy as suppliers of last resort and strategic national assets in times of crisis, as innovators and innovation partners in areas which can be significant for sustaining strategic advantage through science and technology, as suppliers to the UK defence industry and CNI, and as competition for international suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of domestic production is important, but it has limits. Many military and civilian steels are imported from reliable suppliers in allied countries, and a lack of cost competitiveness and downstream processing capacity constrains the domestic industry’s ability to participate in some markets. Local and international market headwinds hamper innovation, impacting UK steelmakers’ ability to enhance strategic advantage or improve profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK steel industry has reached a crux. Continuous financial crisis since 2008 and the need for heavy investment to decarbonise before ageing assets reach end of life mean that government action is needed to prevent sector collapse. Many European steel producers have similarly ageing assets and face the same global market pressures, but are receiving large-scale government support to install lower-emissions plants, and they face significantly lower energy costs. Without moves to level the playing field, alongside joint efforts between industry and government to chart a path to more efficient and low-emissions production, it is possible that two of the UK’s four operational blast furnaces will cease to operate within a few years, potentially alongside one or more of the four electric arc furnaces (EAFs) that operate around Sheffield and Cardiff. While the decline of the industry has so far had relatively limited impact beyond the people and businesses directly affected, it is likely that the national security implications of further loss of capacity would be felt more widely. The UK would become the biggest economy by far worldwide to have no significant domestic steelmaking capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government action which prevents further loss of capacity and supports modernisation and sustainability would therefore reduce risk to the UK economy and society, and indications in January 2023 that the government will support the sector should be welcomed. However, this support would benefit from being nested within a transparent strategic framework that both sets a direction for the sector and outlines what the government wishes to achieve by supporting it, particularly in the context of a rapidly changing technology environment. Reform to the investment environment remains essential to reduce reliance on the public purse in future. The government’s consideration of a carbon border tax suggests that it may be moving in this direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Climate Foundation funded this research as part of RUSI’s UK National Security and the Net Zero Transition project. It aims to examine the relevance of the domestic steel industry to national security and to offer an analysis of the options for decarbonising the UK steel industry from a risk perspective. This paper addresses three research questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does the domestic steel industry impact national security, specifically economic resilience?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What current dependencies (raw materials, fossil fuels, energy) exist within the UK steel supply chain and what security issues arise as a result?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What options exist for decarbonising the UK steel sector that minimise national risks?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper presents its findings in three chapters. Chapter I introduces the steelmaking technologies and processes currently used in the UK and outlines existing dependencies and security issues. It goes on to present the main options for decarbonisation. Chapter II assesses the relevance of domestic steel production for economic resilience and the risks associated with the continued decline of the steel industry in the UK. Chapter III addresses systemic risks facing several decarbonisation pathways and suggests that a diversified approach may offer the lowest overall risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A literature review was conducted from September to November 2022 to assess the current challenges facing the industry and the most viable decarbonisation pathways, as well as UK government policy. The review covered government policy and research documents and net zero pathways from a range of industry and civil society organisations, in addition to academic literature from 2017 onwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between October and December 2022, the author conducted 18 interviews under the Chatham House rule with heads or directors of sustainability or government affairs at steel companies and industry associations, in the civil service and civil society organisations, as well as academics, to contextualise the risks and understand perceptions of the commercial and market environment for UK steel producers. A roundtable was held to validate findings. The research focused on steelmaking and did not cover downstream activities such as casting, rolling or finishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;legacy-steelmaking-and-decarbonisation-technologies&quot;&gt;Legacy Steelmaking and Decarbonisation Technologies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter briefly presents current steelmaking technologies and some of the ways they are being adapted to reduce emissions to very low levels. Other technologies do exist but are at an earlier stage of development and are not discussed here. The chapter then discusses existing supply chain vulnerabilities; this allows discussion of some of the risks associated with different decarbonisation pathways in Chapter III.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;steelmaking-technologies&quot;&gt;Steelmaking Technologies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steelmaking is currently dominated by two technologies. Steel producers making primary steel from iron ore most commonly use blast furnace–basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) processes. Iron ore (iron and oxygen, alongside other minerals) is reduced and melted in the blast furnace using coke, produced by oven-heating metallurgical coal (producing tar and sulphur as byproducts), coal and lime. The process removes oxygen from iron ore through chemical reactions with carbon monoxide from the coke and coal, which produce CO2. Limestone helps remove impurities, creating slag, which is used in roads, cement and other applications. Iron-rich liquid metal is then transferred to a basic oxygen furnace, alongside up to 25% scrap steel, where oxygen further removes impurities, and other elements can be added to alter the character of the steel produced. Carbon monoxide and slag are the main byproducts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes natural gas or coal are used to reduce the oxygen content of iron ore without melting, producing direct reduced iron (DRI), which is then fed into a blast furnace to remove impurities. Where very high-quality iron ore is available, the DRI can be used in an EAF to produce primary steel, reducing emissions by around 50% when DRI is produced using gas, compared with conventional BF-BOF. Emissions per tonne of steel produced using gas DRI are around 1.65 tonnes of CO2, compared with around 2.32 tonnes using BF-BOF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibility of using DRI in an EAF creates one of the main decarbonisation pathways for primary steelmaking, as DRI can also be produced using hydrogen. Zero emissions (or green) hydrogen can be produced using zero emissions electricity to power electrolysis of water, while low-carbon hydrogen is possible from the reformation of natural gas coupled with carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technology. DRI can be compacted into briquettes to form hot briquetted iron (HBI), which it is possible to transport globally, creating the possibility of producing HBI where green hydrogen is cheapest, possibly along transport corridors close to iron-ore mines. HBI import is therefore a potentially cost-effective alternative to domestic DRI that does not result in the offshoring of steel production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, EAFs are typically used to recycle steel, producing new steel with very low emissions of around 0.7 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of steel. The range of steels that can currently be produced in an EAF is limited to a degree (in particular for flat products), and is further constrained by the availability of scrap with low levels of residual elements such as copper and phosphorus, a particular challenge in the UK. Scrap steel is heated in the EAF and lime and other materials and gases added to reduce impurities, with slag as a byproduct. EAFs are often used for alloy steels and are always used for stainless steels. They can be economical at small scale, allowing the production of more niche specialist products, which are produced in batches, meaning there is potential for demand management for the electricity network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Producing in batches can make EAF producers more resilient in the face of price volatility. One UK EAF producer shut down production for around a day at a time in 2022 when energy prices were high, while another EAF producer in financial difficulty only produced in batches for relatively price-insensitive aerospace customers. In contrast, to be economically viable, BF-BOF plants must operate around the clock, making them more exposed to extreme price spikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;steelmaking-in-the-uk-and-current-dependencies&quot;&gt;Steelmaking in the UK and Current Dependencies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the UK’s steel production from iron ore takes place at two large integrated sites: Indian-owned Tata Steel UK’s Port Talbot steelworks and China’s Jingye Group-owned British Steel plant in Scunthorpe. These sites accounted for 81.7% of UK domestic steel production in 2021 and around 96% of related CO2 emissions. They are also heavy emitters of other air pollutants. As shown in Table 1 in Chapter II, they produce complementary products, with Port Talbot supplying flat products used in automotive, construction, engineering and packaging, and Scunthorpe producing long products such as steel beams, rails, and wire rod. Scunthorpe also produces semi-finished flat products that are rolled by third parties for plate production. The two sites are therefore integral to mainstream steel production in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining 18.3% of production takes place at EAFs operated by Celsa in Cardiff, Outokumpu in Sheffield and Liberty Steel in Rotherham, using recycled steels of various qualities and producing products ranging from rebar for construction to engineering steels for aerospace (see Table 1 for descriptions). The main decarbonisation challenge for these plants is heating, which currently requires gas and accounts for around 50% of emissions, with the other half coming mostly from electricity. Decarbonisation options for heat at the sites include hydrogen, syngas, biogas, electricity and waste recovery, showing the likely need for hydrogen at dispersed sites. Engineering and stainless steels also face decarbonisation challenges through the use of ferro-alloys, which contribute to direct and indirect emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two integrated sites rely on imports of iron ore and metallurgical coal and coke for steel production. These supply chains are well established but do have vulnerabilities. In 2020, the UK imported iron ore worth $725 million, mostly from Canada ($270 million), Sweden ($198 million), Brazil ($91.4 million), South Africa ($62.6 million), and Russia ($56.6 million). Iron and steel imports from Russia were banned on 14 April 2022, and although this does not appear to have disrupted steel production (in fact iron-ore prices fell over the year), steelmakers reported that operations were made challenging by strained supply chains and import delays. The Covid-19 pandemic proved disruptive for iron-ore prices, with rapid increases in demand in 2021 resulting in prices of $223 per tonne in July 2021, up from $96 per tonne in January 2020, and volatility has continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical coal has also been impacted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia supplied 48% of the UK’s coal in Q2 2021, falling to 19% in Q2 2022, while metallurgical coal imports from Russia fell to zero over the same period. In Q2 2022, the UK imported 1.4 million tonnes of coal – thermal and metallurgical – and produced only 190,000 tonnes. The UK has been scaling down domestic production of metallurgical coal as demand has declined, with controversial plans to develop a new mine in Cumbria approved but questions persisting about the extent to which it will supply UK steel production. Given uncertainty over future metallurgical coal demand from the two integrated sites – as it is possible that coal-free technologies will start to be adopted within the next decade, or that primary steel production will end in the UK altogether – it is unlikely that the mine is being financed on the basis of supplying UK industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are longer-term risks around the supply of metallurgical coal. While investment in mining has remained relatively steady, despite reduced investment in thermal coal mining, analysts are beginning to report that some investors are turning away from metallurgical coal for environmental and reputational reasons. Financiers also report challenges in securing funding for metallurgical coal mines in some regions. Under-investment could cause further price spikes, after the cost of metallurgical coal hit record highs of around $600 per tonne in late 2021 from around $200 in 2019 and with additional volatility following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK steel is heavily reliant on foreign capital and increasingly reliant on foreign technology. This has the benefit of bringing inward investment, but for a systemically important industry also creates risks. Decisions important to the UK economy are made internationally according to imperatives which may not always be in the country’s long-term interest. Foreign ownership also reduces the incentive for public funding for innovation to build advantage in science and technology, as technology can be moved offshore and may not be scaled in the UK. This has knock-on impacts for industry sustainability. Technology is core to profitability in commodity industries, where innovation to produce steels not available from other producers or to produce them more cheaply is the main route to higher margins. As global profitability of the steel industry has declined, multinational steel companies have consolidated research and development operations and much of the legacy UK research capacity has closed or moved abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are implications beyond economic security. Steel technology is an important element of defence technological advantage, and companies such as Liberty Steel produce specialist engineering steels used in aerospace, including missiles, which have historically not been available in countries like China. Frequent financial challenges and lack of protection mean these technologies and potentially sensitive commercial data have historically been vulnerable to acquisition by companies closely connected to or owned by foreign governments. It is possible that the National Security and Investment Act 2021 will at some point see their use in the sector, particularly if large public investments are made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;already-an-outlier&quot;&gt;Already an Outlier&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter sets out the case that the UK is already a global outlier in terms of the size of its domestic steel production capacity and that further decline could meaningfully damage economic resilience. While the decline of the industry to date has not been widely felt outside directly affected businesses and communities, this may not be the case should further capability be lost. This is because some presence has so far been maintained in most product segments, but in many cases only one significant domestic producer remains. This chapter highlights some of the ways in which domestic production is important for the smooth functioning of the national economy, particularly at times when the global steel supply chain faces disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steel production is considered here in the context of its role in the economy. Its role in the defence industry is covered elsewhere. The terms ‘economic security’ and ‘economic resilience’ are used interchangeably to refer to the ways in which the presence of a domestic steel capability may affect the likelihood of serious disruption to downstream sectors during periods of tight supply. Serious disruption in this context means delays, lack of availability, or price increases that might threaten the ongoing viability of a steel-consuming sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CwT0v7w.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Steel Production Against GDP.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: Includes steel production against GDP for all countries other than the US and China, for which data is available from the World Steel Association. The UK is ringed in yellow. Sources: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2022/October&quot;&gt;IMF, ‘World Economic Outlook Database’, October 2022&lt;/a&gt;; World Steel Association, ‘2022 World Steel in Figures’.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the most widely used intermediate goods, steel is required to maintain economic output (replacement and upgrading of existing stock) as well as to support GDP growth (new buildings and factories require large quantities of steel, wealthier populations consume more steel goods) and is related to GDP composition, in particular the size of the manufacturing sector. Domestic steel output is broadly related to these factors, as well as whether the country is an exporter, and the relative cost of domestic steel production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is already an outlier in terms of domestic steel production against GDP, as is clear from Figure 1. The UK’s steel production per unit GDP at 2.27 kg/$1,000 is comparable to Tanzania (2.06 kg/$1,000) and the Philippines (2.28 kg/$1,000). Other outliers are unusual cases, such as the US, with its extremely large GDP (despite this, US steel production per unit GDP was still 65% higher than the UK in 2021), and Denmark, Norway and Switzerland, with small populations and economies that are fully integrated into the EU single market. In absolute terms, domestic production (7.2 million tonnes per year in 2021) is dramatically less than similarly sized advanced economies such as France (13.9 million tonnes per year), Italy (24.4 million tonnes per year) and Germany (40.1 million tonnes per year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestic steel production is related to the size of the manufacturing sector, as shown in Figures 2 and 3, and the relatively small size of the UK manufacturing sector is sometimes thought to account for the small size of domestic steel production. In Figure 2, the cluster of countries around the UK does suggest either a greater willingness to rely on imports, or structural factors that reduce reliance on imports where manufacturing is relatively less important to the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this should not be overstated for the UK. The countries clustered around the UK in Figure 2 all have much smaller economies and populations, making the domestic steel market much smaller. The UK also has a more diverse steel demand from a large (in absolute terms), varied and sophisticated manufacturing sector. This is very apparent in Figure 3, where the UK stands alone among high-income countries in terms of the absolute size of its domestic steel production relative to its manufacturing sector. France, the closest country to the UK in terms of GDP, population and size of manufacturing sector, produces almost double the amount of steel. It is also noteworthy that only one quarter of finished and semi-finished steel was exported globally in 2021 (net exports were even lower, as most major exporters are also major importers), indicating that the sizeable majority of steels produced internationally are consumed in the country of origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, this shows that the UK has been able to sustain a large manufacturing capacity despite limited domestic steel production. On the other, as is shown in Table 1, the UK has managed to maintain a steelmaking capacity across many product segments and some parts of the economy will face a more vulnerable steel supply if this remaining capacity is lost, particularly if emissions costs continue to rise, making long-distance import of steel less competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study does not attempt an international comparison of steel supply since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, which, along with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has tested supply chains extensively. Questions about the importance of domestic steel production for supply security would benefit from additional research on the impact of the two crises on steel supply. However, given global steel shortages, which included shortages in the UK, it is likely that the domestic industry did play a role in reducing the impact of global supply disruption. Certainly, domestic producers adapted to local shortages – for example, producing tin cans following panic buying of food, enabling shops to restock, and steel for beds in emergency Nightingale hospitals built as part of the UK’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the crises of recent years have taken place in the context of global over-capacity of steel. It is not clear how implementation of instruments such as carbon border adjustment mechanisms or the worsening relations between the West and China – which produced 53% of the world’s steel in 2021 – will affect global supply dynamics. Restrictions on the purchase of steel from unabated blast furnaces – which accounted for 70.8% of global steel supply in 2021 – could make global steel supply more vulnerable to major shocks such as the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

Data excludes the US.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK sector is additionally vulnerable because of its reliance on two integrated sites for most production and its poor investment environment for steel. Should production cease at either site without replacement elsewhere, the UK would be left without a meaningful steel production capacity in many of the largest consumer segments (see Table 1). The largest economy currently without domestic steel production is the Republic of Ireland (whose GDP is 16% of the size of the UK’s), followed by Denmark (12%), Hong Kong (12%), Puerto Rico (3%) and Ethiopia (3%). If steel production were to cease in Port Talbot and Scunthorpe, the UK’s position would be globally unique as by far the largest economy and steel consumer to be almost completely reliant on imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;domestic-resilience&quot;&gt;Domestic Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the UK steel industry has been hollowed out since its peak in 1970, it maintains a notable presence across most steel product segments (see Table 1, which contains the most recent available breakdown). Also clear from the table is the limited overlap between different UK steel producers. This shows the degree to which the UK maintains a skeleton steel industry; losing more capacity would result in the loss of all domestic presence and capability in some market segments. This means that the end of steel production at any one site could leave some steel consumers completely reliant on imports – in some cases from single suppliers (see the structural steel case study, p. 22) – even when impact on national production volumes is limited. CNI could be impacted, with 95% of rails for rail transport produced by British Steel in Scunthorpe (see Table 1), although regulation could be amended to allow increased imports. Construction is the largest customer for UK steel, and where supply chain disruption may be most widely felt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breadth of the UK steel industry is significant for national security and resilience, providing a buffer against delays due to global supply chain disruption and some degree of price insulation, depending on the cause of inflation. As mentioned above, both the energy transition and geopolitical disruption have the potential to impact the supply of steel available to UK consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loss of capacity at a large scale might take decades to recover, if it is recoverable at all, because of the loss of supporting infrastructure and expertise. This creates the potential for the UK to suffer shortages or price inflation that are worse than those of comparable countries. Although small, the industry in its current form can reduce or prevent shortages through unused capacity and, if necessary, expand production relatively quickly using existing sites, infrastructure, personnel and, in some cases, mothballed assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK steel companies argue that the industry provides flexibility and a depth of customer relationship that is hard to replicate with imports. One UK producer alone supplies 60,000 grade and dimension variations each year. Many of these are made to customer specification, facilitating downstream efficiencies by reducing processing or steel intensity. Imports are more likely to take the form of standardised bulk shipments. UK producers are also innovation partners with downstream manufacturers, both civilian and military. The need for these relationships may be heightened during the energy transition, where collaboration between steel producers and downstream companies may play a heightened role in innovation and product development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some products supplied by the industry do not have ready alternatives and their production can depend on multiple steelmakers or production of commodity steels when there are no orders for specialised steels to ensure maximum asset utilisation. One example is a specialist steel critical for Rolls-Royce jet engines, which is first produced by Outokumpu in Sheffield before being remelted and rolled by Liberty Steel to decrease the risk of non-metallic inclusions and achieve the correct metallurgical properties. Alternative international suppliers are not readily apparent should either site cease production, threatening Rolls-Royce’s supply chain. High-speed rails are also difficult to substitute with imports, as their lengths make them difficult to ship efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loss of capacity at one or both of the integrated steel sites would also bring longer-term risks. The closure of sites may result in loss of infrastructure at ports – primary steel producers import huge quantities of raw materials – and local rail facilities. The size of sites themselves also makes them very hard to replace. This would increase the barriers for future entrants to the market, making industrial recovery more challenging. Access to emerging steel products might also be threatened. New steels such as electrical steels – an alloy with magnetic properties used in electric motors, generators, transformers and other electrical applications – are often supply constrained. Electrical steel supply is expected to remain constrained globally for several years, and a country with a steel market as large as the UK might seek to attract producers to the country in order to supply domestic manufacturers. If the infrastructure is not there because of historic loss of industry, establishing operations in the UK will come with costs that are not present in any other advanced economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;case-study-1-structural-steel&quot;&gt;`Case Study 1: Structural Steel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Domestic steel production can play an important role in supply diversity. The market for open-section structural steel – the steel I- and H-beams typically used in building frames – is supplied roughly equally by British Steel in Scunthorpe and ArcelorMittal from its European operations. The closure of the Scunthorpe site would result in open-section customers – which make up the largest demand segment of the 1.2-million-tonne-per-year structural steel market in construction – relying almost exclusively on one supplier that is based abroad.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Relying solely on imports would therefore risk monopoly pricing and supply delays, as well as greater potential for longer delays during periods of broader steel supply disruption, such as recently with the Covid-19 pandemic. In the longer term, changes in market dynamics, such as ArcelorMittal finding more profitable markets elsewhere or undergoing a strategic reorientation, could result in shortages or price gouging in the UK, with no alternatives readily available for UK customers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Lack of action on decarbonisation also has the potential to disrupt open-section supply. Demand for low-carbon steel is already having an impact on overall demand, particularly from large corporate clients with net zero commitments. British Steel has embodied emissions for its open sections of about 2.45 tonnes CO2 per tonne steel, while ArcelorMittal’s are around 0.524 tonnes CO2 per tonne, as it uses recycled steel. Steel producers also face competition from alternative materials with different emission profiles, such as timber and concrete.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;decarbonisation-pathways&quot;&gt;Decarbonisation Pathways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market pressures and UK and international government regulation mean that UK steel producers will need to drastically reduce CO2 emissions if they are to continue operating. The UK’s Climate Change Committee recommends that emissions from iron and steel are reduced to ‘near zero’ by 2035, although this target has not been formally adopted by government or specified as an absolute value. From the perspective of risk, the decarbonisation options for the UK’s two integrated sites can be approximately divided into four pathways, summarised in Figure 4. Each option has different risks and benefits. Two have intermediate steps to bridge the gap to hydrogen becoming commercially available. Combinations of approaches are possible and may prove beneficial in reducing risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OLMxVWs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Decarbonisation Options for the UK’s Integrated Steel Production Sites.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has some comparative advantages. In Europe, its geology is second only to Norway’s for CCUS potential, with more prospective capacity than the rest of the continent combined. Both of its integrated steel sites are coastal, and Port Talbot has gas import infrastructure already in place that could be used for gas DRI or, in future, hydrogen imports, although it is poorly positioned for increased electricity supply. The port might be used to ship CO2 captured using CCUS to the HyNet storage fields off Merseyside. Scunthorpe is close to gas pipelines that may eventually transport green hydrogen from Scottish wind farms or CO2 to storage sites. British Steel is an integral part of the East Coast Cluster, selected alongside HyNet as the first CCUS projects to be developed in Track 1 of the UK’s CCUS programme, with around £1 billion of public funding on offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operational and in-development offshore wind plants may make the UK competitive with the rest of Europe producing green hydrogen domestically, depending on appropriate regulatory and pricing structures being put in place. National Grid ESO (the system operator for the electricity grid) is assessing the practicality of using curtailed wind at low cost to produce hydrogen, while National Grid Gas is looking at the potential to convert around 25% of its existing network to hydrogen. The economics and opportunity costs compared with other potential uses of curtailed wind power or importing green hydrogen or related products such as HBI are not yet clear, as electrolysers would likely be oversized with lower capacity factors, adding to costs. In the longer term, the UK is unlikely to be globally competitive in green hydrogen production and might benefit from its historic openness to trade by building strategic partnerships to import competitively priced intermediate products such as HBI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;decarbonisation-risks&quot;&gt;Decarbonisation Risks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter identifies and discusses specific systemic risks associated with decarbonisation pathways that may impact the UK’s steel supply or the sustainability of the industry. Systemic risk here refers to risks associated with the availability of resources necessary for steel production and capacity to scale up availability, technological risks where solutions are not yet proven, and market risks beyond the control of individual companies or countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;systemic-risks&quot;&gt;Systemic Risks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steelmakers face significant risks in each decarbonisation pathway, as summarised in Annex II. The government will need to manage both macro and financial risks for its own balance sheet. Most estimates of the cost of decarbonising a 3–4-million-tonne-per-year integrated steel site are in the region of £1–4 billion, depending on the site and not including upgrades to infrastructure such as electricity. Alternative models with new dispersed EAF sites may also require government backing, albeit with more diversified risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure national requirements are satisfied, negotiations with incumbent steel producers over the optimal pathway for their sites should take place in the context of a clear national risk framework for the sector, the pillars of which are proposed in Annex I. Any framework will need to balance and manage to the greatest extent possible the following risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scrap Steel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversion to scrap steel is one of the quickest, cheapest and most technologically proven ways to reduce emissions, and has the advantage of a domestic supply chain. However, converting the UK’s integrated sites entirely to scrap would come with two important risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steel is already one of the most recycled materials on Earth; very little scrap steel that is collected is wasted, although collection rates appear correlated to price, suggesting that scrap availability could be increased, and scrap quality could certainly be improved. Global availability is most closely linked to historical steels reaching end of life. This means that at any one time the scrap supply is, roughly speaking, fixed and zero sum. As EU steel producers are already moving to secure more supplies, including in the UK, shortages or price rises in future are likely. This is exacerbated by increasing restrictions on scrap exports globally. UK steelmakers using scrap steel are concerned about supply. One producer using high-quality scrap – generally offcuts from manufacturing – reported being confident of their current supplies but questioned whether there would be sufficient supply should one or other of the integrated sites convert to scrap. A producer able to use lower-grade scrap expressed more concern over future availability due to increasing demand globally and lack of investment in the UK scrap supply chain. The company is investing in its own scrapyards to improve its security of supply, but will remain exposed to global price pressures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using scrap steel always reduces CO2 emissions, whether used in an EAF or a BF-BOF, albeit with widely varying potential for emissions reduction depending on the product being made. Because scrap supply is ultimately limited to historical use and global demand for steel is projected to continue increasing through to 2050, the increased use of scrap beyond growth in availability has climate risks if it substitutes rather than complements primary production globally. Metals consultancy CRU argues that decarbonisation using scrap beyond increases in primary scrap supply in advanced economies may not result in meaningfully lower global emissions, instead displacing scrap use to other markets, but that it would reduce investment in primary steel, which is expected still to account for 55–60% of steel consumption in 2050 because of growing global demand. The challenge should not be overstated. Some UK-made steel products, such as sections, can be made efficiently using scrap in an EAF with no changes to technology, and increased use of scrap for these purposes is a potentially quick and effective means of decarbonising. Furthermore, UK scrap is often exported to countries with less stringent environmental controls, generating other environmental risks. However, continuing primary steelmaking in some product segments reduces pressure on scrap supply while ensuring overall reductions in CO2 emissions, alongside the potential technological benefits discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct Reduced-Grade Iron Ore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only very high grades of iron ore, making up around 4% of global reserves, are currently suitable for DRI – whether with hydrogen, gas or coal – without using a blast furnace. Where CCUS is not available or economical, as is the case for most of continental Europe, DRI is one of the few feasible decarbonisation pathways for primary steel production. This means that supplies of DR-grade iron ore could become highly competitive in the medium term, with potential for price escalation and availability constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work is under way to increase mining capacity, but this is unlikely to keep pace with demand. Estimates of the rise in demand for DR-grade iron ore range from five to 10 times current demand by 2050, and shortages by 2030 are already predicted in the absence of a technological breakthrough. Research and consultancy company Wood Mackenzie estimates that a fivefold increase in demand for DR-grade iron ore to 750 million tonnes per year globally will be needed, requiring $250–300-billion investment in mining by 2050, with two-thirds for new high-grade ore exploration. The Energy Transition Commission found that to meet demand, new ore deposits would need to be established, greater pre-processing of lower grades would be required, or new melter technologies would need to be developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been some successes in developing technologies allowing use of lower-grade ores – particularly coupling DRI with basic oxygen furnaces – but their timely commercialisation and extent of effectiveness is not guaranteed. With no pilots taking place in the UK, it is not clear that UK steel producers will have access to emerging technologies. This suggests that full conversion of both integrated sites to a DRI + EAF pathway without significant investment within the UK in technologies allowing the use of lower-grade iron ore could create unpalatable risks to the UK steel supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EAFs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some technological challenges facing EAFs, particularly around a subset of flat steel products. Around 96% of flat steel products (more than half of steel demand) in the EU were produced by BF-BOF, despite 79% of long products being produced in EAFs. Most steel products can now be made in an EAF, but there is a subset of flat steel products serving the automotive and food packaging industries that cannot. While a relatively small proportion of overall production, these products have high margins and are important for the business case for Port Talbot. There are some promising pilots where similar steels have been made using EAFs, but these have not yet been commercialised and none have taken place in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EAFs have the advantage of being a very well-established technology, and gas DRI for primary steelmaking is in operation in many locations across the globe (a gas DRI plant was previously operated by British Steel). This means that while there are questions about hydrogen technology, using gas as an intermediate step is well understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plans to decarbonise primary steelmaking using EAFs nearly always use gas DRI as a step to hydrogen. Taking this approach would increase UK exposure to gas markets; around 10 gigajoules (GJ) of natural gas is required for each tonne of DRI, implying annual demand of 59 million GJ for conversion of both integrated sites at current levels of production, equivalent to roughly 27% of total industrial gas use in 2019 prior to the coronavirus pandemic. Conversion to hydrogen may not reduce reliance on natural gas in the medium term, with the UK planning initially to use blue hydrogen with CCUS. Decisions on using hydrogen or attaching CCUS to gas DRI sites are likely to be taken separately as supply becomes available, meaning emissions from the industry could continue for some time, albeit at a lower rate. It is not clear whether this would be feasible in the context of the sixth carbon budget as the government has not committed to a specific CO2 emissions reduction for steel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EAFs generally employ fewer people, an economic risk for the areas around converted sites. However, greater dispersal of EAF sites compared with BF-BOF plants would mean the economic benefits of the industry would be more widely spread and the economic risk associated with any one site’s ongoing viability would be reduced, potentially contributing to a more competitive market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CCUS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workforces at both Port Talbot and Scunthorpe have long experience with BF-BOF technology. Use of the technology to produce their range of products is well established. This is an advantage of CCUS, which might provide steel companies with more certainty over the steelmaking technology itself than alternatives. The 25- to 30-year lifespan of a blast furnace might allow their replacement by other technologies around 2050 in order to fully eliminate emissions and other pollutants. In the UK, major investments will be required to modernise ageing steel production assets alongside any investment in CCUS, and this should be considered in pathway comparisons. CCUS critics argue that while pilot projects for DRI-based approaches have proliferated and major investments have been committed, very few if any pilot projects applying CCUS to steel are under way, suggesting that the business case may not be as positive as sometimes stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinions on CCUS economic feasibility within the industry and among analysts are diverse. The first CCUS schemes in the UK are targeting commercial operation around 2027, early enough for steel users to earn a first-mover premium if technological barriers can be overcome in time. However, the Energy Transition Commission estimates that at $1.1–2.2/kg for hydrogen, hydrogen DRI steelmaking would be more competitive than CCUS, and these levels could be achieved in the mid- to late 2030s, potentially earlier. This is supported by academic analyses finding that CCUS will be the most expensive technology, other than at times of unusually high electricity prices. But some steelmakers and the International Energy Agency argue that CCUS should have a role, with some preliminary assessments suggesting CCUS may already be competitive with the 2022–23 emissions scheme trading reference price of £62.10 per tonne of CO2. Questions also persist about the availability of hydrogen in sufficient volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CCUS is an imperfect solution from a climate and environmental point of view. CCUS cannot remove all emissions. Pilots at coal power plants suggest that 90–95% of emissions might be removed from a point source of emissions, but steel has multiple emissions points, (depending on configuration and whether gases are used for power generation), not all of which are easily adapted to CCUS requirements. This may result in less effective CCUS performance, with associated emissions trading costs. Similarly, the effectiveness of retrofitting CCUS is uncertain. CCUS does not address other harmful pollutants affecting air quality in and around the integrated sites, which are present at much lower levels in scrap or DRI + EAF pathways. There are also technical challenges specific to applying CCUS to blast furnaces. Gas pressure at the top of a blast furnace is critical to its effective operation and the impact of adding a process in that part of the furnace is not well understood or researched, meaning that steel companies may not be in a position to use CCUS infrastructure immediately if it becomes available. Poor CCUS performance would have significant commercial implications for steelmakers because of emissions trading costs and potential loss of market share to lower-carbon alternatives. However, the technology also has the potential to remove CO2 emissions earlier and more thoroughly than alternatives, which would have a significant impact on carbon budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be long-term strategic risks to over-reliance on CCUS. Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that 56% of primary steel production will use DRI + EAF by 2050. This would mean a huge amount of research and innovation in DRI + EAF approaches likely to result in new methods to produce new grades of steel and a major global industry in technologies, such as pelletisation. It would also make DRI + EAF the major growth segment of one of the world’s largest industries. With no exposure to this technology, the UK would be a ‘technology taker’ with limited access to opportunities in what may become the fastest-growing steel technology segment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid Approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hybrid approach would encourage the industry to use a mix of options, most likely dominated by EAFs but potentially with CCUS at one or two blast furnaces and other high-emission points like lime kilns. Such an approach is proposed in the British Steel Low-Carbon Roadmap. EAFs are able to vary proportions of scrap and iron ore depending on availability and price, introducing some resilience, although this is mitigated by the correlation between scrap and iron-ore prices. Industry representatives argue that colocation of EAFs and blast furnaces may bring some benefits, allowing molten iron to be used in the EAF to expand product capability and reduce overall energy demand. Gas demand may be complemented by and eventually replaced with green hydrogen to reduce exposure to international markets, but medium-term gas supply risks are difficult to mitigate without maintaining one or two blast furnaces with CCUS and a strong scrap steel supply chain. The combination of technologies could provide sufficient risk mitigation to ensure security of supply and access to emerging technologies. It also has the advantage of allowing flexibility in the face of infrastructure pressure points such as electricity supply, gas, hydrogen and CCUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no risk-free future for the steel industry. Weighing the risks of different approaches to decarbonisation definitively is impossible at this point, because of the low level of technological and infrastructural preparedness in key areas, and market immaturity for decarbonised inputs. What is clear is that the highest-risk route is the status quo and continued delay to investment in the sector, which comes with a significant risk that steelmaking capabilities and capacity essential to economic resilience will be lost and not recoverable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any policy approach seeking to minimise national security risks should begin with the premise that UK national security and economic resilience may be seriously impaired by further major reductions in the UK steel industry’s overall product range and market share. Risks to supply chain security are heightened by the lack of redundancy in the sector, which requires the government to work with the incumbent or take steps to facilitate new entrants into the affected market segment to avoid loss of capability. Creating a viable business environment would reduce this risk and could result in significant expansion in investment, given the relatively low levels of steel production in the UK relative to the size of the market. This would increase competition and add redundancy, while making it easier for the government to avoid picking winners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policy should recognise that security of supply is always improved by using less and reusing, which can also improve downstream productivity. Initiatives to reduce over-engineering in buildings and improve product design to reduce steel intensity, as well as to improve or create markets for used steel as opposed to recycled steel, will help boost overall economic resilience and reduce CO2 emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All foundation industries face related challenges with the current business environment and technological, policy and market uncertainty around the energy transition. The government should consider putting in place a foundation industry strategy with measures to put the industries on a sustainable footing through the energy transition and chart a course to decarbonisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government should consider a sector-wide arrangement similar to the North Sea Transition Deal for steel, bringing together government, industry and relevant regulatory authorities to guide the sector during the transition period. The deal would tackle issues such as funding for decarbonisation, the role of primary and scrap-based steelmaking, the potential for public–private facilities such as a shared DRI facility, and regulatory measures such as carbon and electricity pricing reform, as well as the creation of a market for low-emissions steel in the UK and globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;annex-i-pillars-of-a-strategic-risk-framework-for-foundation-industries&quot;&gt;Annex I: Pillars of a Strategic Risk Framework for Foundation Industries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy transition is a strategic risk for foundation industries: cement, ceramics, glass, paper, metals and bulk chemicals. Technological overhaul and market disruption threaten the competitiveness of traditional industries that produce the materials essential for the functioning of the UK economy. Individual industries would benefit from ongoing assessment through a strategic risk framework that establishes a national perspective on risks associated with the steel industry and helps clarify government priorities. This annex highlights the main risk areas for steel decarbonisation that might form the basis of such a framework and help inform strategy and policy, as the technological and commercial environment evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-decarbonisation-for&quot;&gt;What is Decarbonisation for?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guiding any national risk framework covering the decarbonisation of an industry must be the question of what decarbonisation is expected to achieve. Decarbonisation of the UK industry must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases globally as part of the national contribution to fighting climate change. Decarbonisation should aim to retain critical UK industrial capabilities and market share and ideally improve competitiveness and innovation. The process should result in secure supply chains with limited price volatility and guaranteed availability. Any pathway must be backed by timely access to infrastructure and technology, along with an appropriate legislative, trade and regulatory environment, and should include risk mitigation to overcome bottlenecks. These decision factors make up the following strategic pillars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, climate policy currently revolves around national targets centred on a single high-level number: a theoretically determined amount of CO2 that can be emitted over a set time period without exceeding legally binding carbon budgets. The approach comes with significant risk that emissions will simply be offshored, with UK consumers causing emissions through import markets and UK production undermined by lower-cost high-emissions alternatives. To ensure that a policy has a meaningful impact on reducing CO2 emissions, the impact on emissions from the whole supply chain, the industry globally and changes to customer behaviour should be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy transition is fundamentally changing the competitive basing of economies. This is due to transitions to new technologies that may be more efficient, have new capabilities, or be more expensive but with lower emissions. It is also associated with the transition away from more commoditised forms of energy such as oil, coal and natural gas, to renewable technologies where competitiveness is determined by local and regional resources and access to the most efficient technology and low-cost capital. The result is that the balance of global economic competitiveness may face another period of upheaval and the impact of these changes on foundation industries should be carefully monitored to ensure ongoing sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply Chains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New technologies and processes will in many cases require new supply chains, both for technology and equipment and for raw materials, where new materials may be required or existing materials may be used in different proportions. With demand for certain technologies set to increase dramatically, in some cases exponentially, shortages of manufacturing capacity or raw materials are very likely. The impact of decarbonisation pathways and different policy options on supply chain resilience should always be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New supply chains present new surfaces for environmental and human security challenges, corruption and disruptive geopolitics that require ongoing assessment. These will be examined in relation to net zero technologies in later research papers from this project and are an important risk, with the potential to cause significant disruption if not managed effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net zero technologies require new materials and energy sources, some of which require new infrastructure. Access must be timely, affordable and secure. For foundation industries, electricity, hydrogen and CCUS infrastructure are the main areas of business-critical infrastructural change, and businesses will not be able to decarbonise without one or another of them. Policy and regulation relating to CO2 emissions and industry should take into account the availability of infrastructure necessary to decarbonise in order to avoid disincentivising investment and adding costs that companies have no possibility of avoiding because necessary infrastructure is not available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy transition is a monumental economic challenge and opportunity. For industries such as steel and other hard-to-abate sectors, it will mean the technological rebasing of the entire industry. Sectors which have not seen changes to fundamental technologies for decades, such as iron, steel and cement, find themselves in a competitive environment where access to technology, the ability to innovate and the ability to source clean energy competitively are critical to survival. Industrial strategy needs to recognise these risks and ensure that policies will facilitate sufficient access to technology and innovation support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New technologies bring new risks. These range from cyber risks to a changing profile of vulnerability to criminal, military or terrorist attack. In many cases, decarbonised industries are likely to be more dispersed – for example, relying on EAFs in multiple locations rather than large integrated sites – which in general should make the industry as a whole more resilient. But smart industry can be exposed to increased cyber risk, and safety systems running with limited margin for error or with new fuels with different safety characteristics, such as hydrogen, can also increase risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legislation, Trade and Regulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All aspects of the energy transition require a foundation of strong legislation, regulation and trade policy. Rapidly changing infrastructure requires responsive and adaptable regulators and policymakers. In order to invest, decarbonising industries not only require line of sight on the business environment but in conditions of systemic uncertainty, such as the energy transition, they also benefit from established and public government strategic objectives and an idea of the frameworks that will underpin future decision-making. This means that industrial policy and sector agreements may be much more important for the ongoing functioning of foundation industries than is normally the case, as both the government and industry seek to navigate the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（8日）踏入審訊第21天，區諾軒繼續接受盤問。辯方周一展示區諾軒1月尾寫予鄭達鴻的私人信件，形容鄭被公民黨「連累」等，區今甫開庭便舉手示意，指信件「其實對我都有一定嘅傷害，我更加唔想第三者造成傷害」，望之後提問如非必要，「可免則免」。法官陳仲衡指辯方如認為信件有助其當事人，可就此盤問，除非問題與案無關法庭才會介入，區諾軒表示「我會從容面對」，被告欄傳出笑聲。區諾軒在盤問下並確認，並不肯定鄭達鴻曾否同意在當選後「無差別」否決預算案，又指曾於2020年5月與沈旭暉及林瑞華等功能組別參選人作「非正式交流」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指展示私人信件造成一定傷害-望之後提問可免則免&quot;&gt;區諾軒指展示私人信件造成一定傷害 望之後提問「可免則免」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的資深大律師潘熙周一盤問時，展示區諾軒今年1月尾寫予鄭達鴻的私人信件，形容鄭達鴻被公民黨「連累」，又指若非公民黨忽然「搶疆」開記者會，他和李予信的處境會截然不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今甫坐下便舉起右手，表示：「我有個建議，上一庭展示過私人信件呢，其實對我都有一定嘅傷害，我更加唔想第三者造成傷害，希望接下來嘅提問如果引用唔係必要嘅，可免則免。」何桂藍面露愕然。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡表示，區諾軒要明白辯方如認為信件有助其當事人，可就信件內容盤問，除非問題與案無關，法庭才會介入。區諾軒向法官點頭：「我會從容面對」，林卓廷等發笑。法官李運騰表示，文件可僅展示予證人及法庭，但不一定需向公眾展示，辯方往後可與控方商討。潘熙則向區諾軒表示，其信件是由控方在「未被使用材料」披露，故他有責任就此向區提問，但他不會再就信件發問，會就另一範疇發問，區表示「明白」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區確認7月11日前認為否決預算案合法不肯定鄭達鴻曾否同意無差別否決財案&quot;&gt;區確認7月11日前認為否決預算案合法、不肯定鄭達鴻曾否同意無差別否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙早前展示多篇戴耀廷《國安法》前後談及初選不違法的帖文、文章及訊息，今再展示戴耀廷5月5日於《明報》撰寫的文章〈立會否決財政預算案的憲制設計〉，區同意戴認為否決財政預算案致特首下台是符合《基本法》。至於5月12日〈「支持否決」不能成為DQ理由——再論立會否決財政預算案的憲制設計〉一文，戴提及全國政協委員張志剛對他指正，他須指出其觀點謬誤，區同意此為建制派認為初選有問題的其中一個觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙再問及，《國安法》實施後、區諾軒於7月15日退出初選工作前，是否至少有部分候選人關注否決財政預算案會否違法。區表示候選人是擔心會否觸犯《國安法》，「但未去到討論否決財政預算案本身係咪犯法咁仔細」，但戴曾嘗試向候選人解釋否決預算案是「沒有違法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問，區有否聽過候選人表達對戴耀廷回應的質疑，區指「觀察唔到」，因通常是候選人找戴耀廷的「一對一對話」。區在法官詢問下同意，他並無參與其中，李運騰遂着他只談及自己認知的內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙再引戴耀廷7月1日發予趙家賢和區諾軒等人的訊息，提及「因此，35+的目標要否決財政預算案，應沒有觸犯國安法」。區確認，由當天到7月9日初選記者會和7月11日初選投票日會見記者，戴耀廷都仍然相信否決財政預算案是合法。而他本人亦相信戴耀廷指否決預算案是合法的看法，他也看不到其他候選人對此表達異議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙再問及，區諾軒個人是否不知道鄭達鴻曾否同意當選後「無差別」否決財政預算案，區答：「我唔肯定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱5月曾與沈旭暉及功能組別人士非正式交流-林瑞華5至7月曾表達否決的兩難&quot;&gt;區稱5月曾與沈旭暉及功能組別人士非正式交流 林瑞華5至7月曾表達否決的兩難&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒在盤問下同意，當時有留意功能組別人士有否參選，並從參選記者招待會及選舉事務處網頁等，得知公民黨林瑞華最終有報名參選立法會。潘熙其後就區諾軒的手機行事曆盤問，區指「我反而唔介意」在庭上展示行事曆。就早前供稱的「沈旭暉35+交流會」，區表示於2020年3月下午2、3時在新蒲崗一個圓桌會議（roundtable）的辦事處舉行，並在翻查行事曆後確定於3月20日早上10時，於新蒲崗勤達中心一單位舉行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oWOG31V.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 沈旭暉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後展示行事曆，顯示3月20日的紀錄無沈旭暉名字，但同年5月6日則有題為「simon shen」的紀錄。區解釋交流會於3月舉行，而5月6日是與沈旭暉和其他功能組別參選人在林瑞華創辦的餐廳晚膳，作「非正式交流」，林瑞華亦有出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙問，林當日是否仍有表達對否決預算案的關注，區指該些功能組別人士「絕少提及」有關是否否決預算案的問題，而就他對林瑞華於5月至7月的「總括印象」，林的確向他提及過否決預算案的「兩難」，因他要照顧飲食界選民。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問5月6日會面上曾否討論該議題，區答「肯定唔係主題」，但他不確定林瑞華當天有否向他表達此意見。他印象中當日出席的候選人亦無參與初選。區在盤問下再確認，在該次會面後，由2020年5月到7月，林瑞華曾向他表示否決預算案的兩難。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zJwN0uG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（8日）踏入審訊第21天。區諾軒繼續接受盤問，其書面供詞提及他初選後曾公開鮮明反對戴耀廷言論，認為初選應與戴文章分開審視。區今提及他辦初選的「初心」，是不應捆綁參選人就否決預算案的立場，但「好可惜」戴耀廷在初選發展過程發文鼓勵參加者運用否決權，令初選有「質性上」的變化，《國安法》後初選的犯法風險亦越來越高。區又形容，戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步〉一文想法太瘋狂，尤其最後一步「要攬住中共跳出懸崖」：「我哋係生活喺一國兩制下嘅香港，你發表一篇文章挑動咗國家嘅情緒，我認為係過份咗啦」，有被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，區確認他主要負責地方選區及超區的工作，沒有「沾手」衞生服務界，而該界別無召開協調會議，亦無就否決預算案字眼作討論，他對余慧明參選目標等無直接認知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ao8vM81.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 余慧明&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指只曾見過余慧明一次-對當選後會有何行為無直接認知&quot;&gt;區諾軒指只曾見過余慧明一次 對當選後會有何行為無直接認知&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第八被告鄭達鴻和第四十一被告梁國雄的資深大律師潘熙下午完成盤問，代表第十被告楊雪盈的大律師張耀良原打算接着發問，惟法官要求先由代表第五被告吳政亨和第四十七被告余慧明的大律師石書銘開始。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘指就吳政亨沒有問題要問，並為余慧明作盤問。區諾軒在盤問下同意，只在2020年7月初銅鑼灣教協舉辦的初選記者會上，見過余慧明一次，當時余是會上其中一名發言者，區幫忙計算其發言時間，「我冇同佢有特別嘅對話。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘其後問到，區諾軒是否不知道余慧明參與初選的目的，區表示只知道包括余慧明的幾個衞生服務界參選人，約於5月曾接觸戴耀廷，稱有興趣舉辦初選，戴與香港民意研究所交流後，接納衞生服務界作為初選參選的界別之一。但區同時指，因為不是他負責，故沒有「沾手」衞生服務界的初選，對於余一旦當選後會有何行為亦沒有直接認知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指衞生服務界無協調會議對戴耀廷與參選人溝通不知情&quot;&gt;區指衞生服務界無協調會議、對戴耀廷與參選人溝通不知情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，他是衞生服務界一個用以發放訊息的 WhatsApp 群組成員之一，並指該群組只是討論初選後勤工作。庭上展示群組資訊，顯示成員包括候選人余慧明、劉凱文、袁偉傑及李國麟，而戴耀廷、民主動力趙家賢、鍾錦麟及職員黎敬輝亦在群組內。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意以其記憶和理解，群組內沒有討論過參選人一旦當選後會作甚麼行為，衞生服務界亦沒有舉辦過協調會議。區亦指，戴耀廷沒有與衞生服務界候選人開會討論，「以我理解，佢係個別聯絡唔同候選人。」區強調自己在群組中「幾乎不發一言」，對戴與候選人討論的內容亦不知情，只知道戴向組織者匯報的資訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱與沈旭暉聯絡者與戴耀廷太唔同-不應視為謀劃一部分&quot;&gt;區稱與沈旭暉聯絡者與戴耀廷「太唔同」 不應視為謀劃一部分&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘其後問及區，他作為初選組織者，是否集中於地方選區及超級區議會，而功能組別只是次要，區表示：「我的確主要負責地方選區及超級區議會嘅組織工作，但唔代表我唔關心功能組別嘅事」，並補充：「但我見到嘅功能組別民主派候選人，同戴耀廷接觸嘅太唔同啦，我接觸嘅主要係同沈旭暉聯絡嘅嗰班人，在本案而言，甚至唔應該視為謀劃嘅一部分」，吳政亨等隨即發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰即指，「其他人士有否參與串謀，是由法庭去決定，不是你」，指區只需告訴法庭他所知道的事（“Whether or not there were other persons involved in this conspiracy, is a matter for the court to decide, not you. You just tell us what you know.”），旁聽席和被告欄再傳出笑聲。區在法官陳仲衡詢問下再確認，與沈旭暉聯絡的人沒有參與初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再問到，地區直選就否決財政預算案的爭議，如使用「會」或「會積極」字眼，有否在衞生服務界出現，區指「的確係冇一個會議觸及過相關嘅討論」；而戴耀廷亦沒有向他提及曾出現有關討論。區並在李運騰詢問下確認，與沈旭暉聯絡、有意參選功能組別的人士，並沒有人來自衞生服務界。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區確認指余慧明是抗爭派因她出席抗爭派記者會&quot;&gt;區確認指余慧明是「抗爭派」因她出席抗爭派記者會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，區諾軒早前曾指余慧明屬「抗爭派」，石書銘問是否因為余曾出席抗爭派記者會，區同意。石再問到，區是否不清楚余參與初選之目的，惟遭法官陳慶偉打斷，指他早前已問相關問題。法官李運騰則指，如石書銘認為其當事人並非抗爭派一員，可向區諾軒指出其案情，石書銘一度回頭望向余慧明，其後沒有再就此發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指曾表明反對戴耀廷文章-指辦初選初心是不應該捆綁否決財案&quot;&gt;區指曾表明反對戴耀廷文章 指辦初選初心是不應該捆綁否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘其後引述區諾軒2022年9月14日的供詞，提及接受港台邀請到節目「千禧年代」，與梁美芬任嘉賓，並指「我於節目上很鮮明地反對戴耀廷文章的言論，公開聲明初選活動與戴耀廷的文章應該分開審視」。在盤問下，區表示他是於退出初選翌日出席該節目。法官陳慶偉追問區所指的是戴耀廷哪篇文章，區指是戴於4月尾發表的「攬炒十步曲，這是香港人的宿命」（應為〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續解釋反對的原因：「我舉辦初選嘅初心，係唔應該捆綁否決預算案嘅立場，但係好可惜，喺初選嘅發展過程，戴耀廷發表過唔少嘅文章，鼓勵唔同參加者運用否決權。」他續指：「去到6、7月嘅時候，開始有唔同嘅輿論聲音指初選犯法，特別係6月30日《港區國安法》立法，初選嘅犯法風險越嚟越高」，這亦是他在節目中指戴耀廷文章應與初選分開的原因。區並重申：「事實係，初選當時嘅法律風險，的確係好高。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指戴攬炒十步想法太瘋狂-令初選有質性上變化&quot;&gt;區指戴攬炒十步想法太瘋狂 令初選有「質性上變化」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，區諾軒與戴耀廷在2020年3月就協調會議討論，其後開始舉行不同選區的協調會議，差不多每個會議的文件都會用到「會運用」或「會積極運用」權力否決財政預算案的字眼，故區諾軒並非在4月尾才知道使用否決權是35+計劃的其中一個元素，區同意，指「我知情嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李遂問：「既然你不同意戴耀廷，有沒有向他表達？」區諾軒指沒有特別向戴表達，是因為協調會議的確存在不同意見，「我曾經相信，呢個係參選者自己嘅選擇」，但當戴4月陸續刊出幾篇關於攬炒的文章後，「我開始覺得佢嘅睇法，令到初選有質性上面嘅變化。」區指這亦是為何他在戴發表文章後，會向他指其文章「想法太瘋狂」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴稱要攬住中共跳出懸崖區指活於一國兩制香港卻挑動國家情緒&quot;&gt;戴稱「要攬住中共跳出懸崖」區指活於一國兩制香港卻挑動國家情緒&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，戴耀廷其實提出了十步，並問區「你認為戴耀廷提及的十步之中，去到哪一步你覺得瘋狂？是第7至10步？還是全部？」，林卓廷、鄒家成等被告發笑。區表示：「我記得佢篇文章有提及一句說話，話要攬住中共跳出懸崖」，陳慶偉指那是第十步，區並解釋：「我哋係生活喺一國兩制下嘅香港，你發表一篇文章挑動咗國家嘅情緒，我認為係過份咗啦」，鄭達鴻、何桂藍等發笑。區最後同意陳慶偉指，是戴耀廷整篇文章給予他的觀感，令他感覺戴是瘋狂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方於盤問後始知區諾軒行事曆-認遲交予辯方&quot;&gt;控方於盤問後始知區諾軒行事曆 認遲交予辯方&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第八被告鄭達鴻和第四十一被告梁國雄的資深大律師潘熙，於午休後表示完成盤問，其後大律師張耀良站起身準備盤問，指他代表第十被告楊雪盈。法官陳慶偉問：「那第五被告（吳政亨）呢？」代表吳的大律師石書銘表示，吳的名字排在公訴書（indictment）的最後（吳曾進行初級偵訊，是最後一名交付高院的不認罪被告，初選案分成認罪和不認罪兩案後，吳被排為本案最後一名被告，獲發編號A18（accused）），惟陳慶偉指「第五被告仍是第五被告（“D5 is still D5.”）」。石書銘其後向走到被告欄前方的吳政亨索取指示後，表示就吳而言，沒有問題要問區諾軒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於石書銘同時代表的余慧明（第四十七被告），石指因不久前才收到控方有關區諾軒行事曆的未被使用材料，望能保留就余的提問，惟法官陳慶偉着他先問其他問題，主控萬德豪亦表示今天審訊前已向石的律師提供該些材料。法官李運騰則指，所有未被使用材料應在開審前已完成審視，對相關申請於數天前才作出感到驚訝。萬德豪解釋，控方於區接受盤問時才意識到該行事曆的存在，故這麼遲才呈交。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張耀良原打算接着盤問-惟法官要求由石書銘開始&quot;&gt;張耀良原打算接着盤問 惟法官要求由石書銘開始&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，石書銘或可就行事曆以外的事情發問。石重申，吳政亨和余慧明排在公訴書的最後，加上由資深大律師潘熙開始發問（鄭達鴻為第八被告，公訴書排首位），故以為他是最後一個發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳慶偉指，肯定石有其他議題要發問；李運騰亦指石應頗清楚他的案情和要問的問題，又指區諾軒已在證人台至少3星期，「你是說你沒有問題要問他嗎？」石指就吳政亨沒有問題，但法官指不是問吳政亨。法官陳仲衡亦指，石同時代表吳政亨和余慧明，理應知道他是「第二個」盤問。（不過根據公訴書，鄭達鴻是本案首名被告，其次是楊雪盈，余慧明和吳政亨排在最後；而若按原來的被告號碼，吳政亨則是首名被告，其次方為鄭達鴻。）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石重申他因公訴書和律師席座位均排在最後而被混淆（confusion），陳慶偉指那絕對不相關。石欲再解釋，惟陳慶偉厲聲指「現在開始你的盤問（“Start your cross examination now.”）」，石再稱望索取指示，惟陳慶偉舉起手中間尺，指着石說：「不，現在開始！（No, now!）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明午續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late January 2023, RUSI’s Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies (CFCS) hosted a roundtable in partnership with the Polish Institute of International Affairs in Warsaw. The discussion, held under the Chatham House rule, gathered representatives from government ministries and agencies, the private sector – including banking institutions, law firms and consulting companies – and civil society. The event was part of RUSI’s ongoing study of EU sanctions implementation and wider responses to illicit finance (Euro SIFMANet) funded by the National Endowment for Democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-polish-legal-framework&quot;&gt;The Polish Legal Framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable opened with a candid statement from representatives of Poland’s public sector, who noted that before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, pressure to implement EU sanctions was low, as they had little or no connection with either the strategic goals of Polish foreign policy, or with individuals/entities and their assets in Poland. In view of the limited scope of those sanctions, this included the sanctions imposed on Russia in 2014. This lack of focus was also reflected by private sector participants, with one representative of the legal sector noting that sanctions had not featured in their work on transaction due diligence, despite the presence of a range of EU sanctions regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, sanctions on Russia since February 2022 have brought to the fore the need to increase Poland’s capabilities to facilitate their implementation. Participants from the public sector stated that Poland has now cut off all reliance on Russia for its energy supply and severed most links to Russian businesses, a process termed by one participant as the ’de-russification’ of the Polish economy. With only 2.8% of Polish exports heading to Russia, Poland already had relatively limited connections with the Russian economy (for example, the country does twice as much trade with the Czech Republic as it does with Russia). In the view of roundtable participants, this limited economic connection with Russia is partly related to the countersanctions Russia has applied to Poland, for example on agricultural products. Still, following Poland’s commitment to effectively implement sanctions to weaken Russia’s capacity to fund and resource its military capabilities, the country has introduced new legislation relating to sanctions. This legal strengthening is underpinned by firm social support for countering Russian aggression against Ukraine, which incentivises both the public and private sectors to apply an unambiguous approach to sanctions implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, representatives from the Polish public sector emphasised that Poland complies not only with UN and EU sanctions, but also with UK and US sanctions, as many transactions are conducted in those countries’ currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of the EU’s sanctions regulations and designations, in 2022 Poland introduced additional legislation offering ‘specific solutions in counteracting the promotion of aggression against Ukraine and serving to protect national security’. A representative from the National Revenue Administration (NRA) provided a detailed description of the country’s new legislative framework, in which the Ministry of Finance is charged with implementing sanctions, and can impose administrative penalties for non-compliance. Within this ministry, the NRA has the most resources to take charge of these issues and is tasked with the supervision of sanctions implementation. However, multiple other agencies have relevant competencies in the national sanctions framework. Customs authorities monitor the transit of goods, and local customs offices can conduct audits and impose administrative penalties. And while the Financial Supervisory Authority audits the financial sector, the Ministry of Economic Development and Technology issues licences for trade on armaments and dual-use goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the novelties introduced by the new legislation was the creation of a national sanctions list. The national list is managed by the Ministry of the Interior and aims to include names of persons and entities beyond those listed by the EU. In order to identify potential additions to the domestic list, Polish authorities look into entities that are not on the EU list but are identified as having Russian or Belarusian shareholders or board members. To this end, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) shares the list with Polish embassies abroad to get further information from the countries they are based in. There are currently 38 individuals and 39 entities on Poland’s national sanctions list. The representative from the NRA at the roundtable noted that some of the listed entities are companies with known links to high-profile Russian individuals established in Poland through the Netherlands, Singapore and Switzerland. The same authority explained that listing has reportedly had a meaningful impact on these companies, with some closing overnight as a result, leading to bankruptcy proceedings. In a testament to Poland’s efforts, representatives from the public sector estimated that assets amounting to €1 billion have been frozen in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As described by the NRA representative, the new sanctions Acts also imposed a national embargo on coal from Russia and Belarus, and introduced administrative penalties for non-compliance, which can amount to 20 million zlotys (around €4.2 million) and prison sentences of three to 15 years. Furthermore, Poland has also introduced new tools such as temporary compulsory administration, which was created to manage the frozen assets of entities subject to sanctions. This legal tool can be used to provide support to the workplaces of sanctioned entities, in order to enable business operations that serve a public utility to keep running, or to protect national economic interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from the public sector were keen to emphasise that Poland is an active contributor of sanctions proposals to the EU and stated that Poland is widely regarded among member states as a good source of sanctions ideas that, they argued, would result in the design of new packages of EU restrictive measures, if not immediately, then certainly at a later date. They believe that the delay in integrating Poland’s ideas into packages at the EU level impacts the effectiveness of those packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, a government representative described Poland as a ‘good runner’ in implementing sanctions, but emphasised that the implementation of sanctions is a ‘relay race’, in which Poland needs the member states that have closer economic links with Russia to pick up the baton of commitment to effectively implement sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-to-implementation&quot;&gt;Challenges to Implementation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National authorities estimate the level of non-compliance among Polish businesses to be very low. In fact, representatives from the public sector added that the country’s main problem is over-compliance beyond what is legally mandated, especially from financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess the level of compliance, representatives from Poland’s financial intelligence unit (FIU) explained that the unit conducts audits and onsite inspections of obliged entities in both financial and non-financial sectors. The majority of investigations are related to customs fraud and the creation of fake customs codes. Under the new sanctions mandate, sanctions inspections have become an add-on to general anti-money-laundering inspections, and authorities have completed two inspections, with three more currently underway. Inspected institutions are most commonly banks, payment service providers, logistics companies and art dealers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from the FIU explained that currently around seven to nine entities are suspected of having breached sanctions but noted that most of them are not Polish. A representative of another public authority added that some of these identified entities are Dutch companies transferring goods to a sanctioned Russian entity, and that their organisation is now investigating whether this was done intentionally. In this case, the source of information was the customs authorities, who have access to information related to the transfer of goods and were supported by the contribution of financial intelligence from Georgia regarding capital transfers to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite Poland’s efforts, participants from the public sector acknowledged that the country faces challenges in the implementation of sanctions. In particular, there are struggles with multi-layered corporate structures, and authorities described a recent example in which they identified a company that had been established in Poland by a Russian oligarch as a subsidiary of a company based in the British Virgin Islands. Representatives from both public and private sectors voiced their intention to be proactive in these operations, but reported that they sometimes face difficulties identifying these complex cases. Participants from the public sector explained that they try to reach out to the intelligence community to obtain relevant information, but its confidential nature means that this information cannot be shared with businesses. For this reason, the introduction of national sanctions lists has proved helpful as a means of alerting the private sector to individuals and entities of concern and enabling the freezing of their assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge highlighted by the public sector was the confiscation of frozen assets. Representatives of public authorities explained that legal barriers continue to hinder confiscation, for example, the need to identify a connection to a criminal offence. They added that they often receive questions about the low number of assets frozen in Poland, but they explained that this matches the fact that there are very few Polish entities listed in EU sanctions lists, and trade between Poland and Russia is limited. The introduction of a domestic list aims to facilitate improvements in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite the confidence of the country’s public authorities in their work, representatives from the private sector voiced concerns over a lack of clarity in the sanctions rules themselves and noted that there were issues related to interpretation of these measures. Participants noted that freezing accounts is simple, but freezing tangible property presents added difficulties. Similarly, it was considered unclear as to what the approach should be in the case of a company where only a small portion of the shares is held by a sanctioned oligarch. These doubts were described by representatives from the banking sector as a major source of uncertainty for businesses, which fear not only the financial penalties associated with facilitating sanctions evasion, but also the reputational implications, the latter being described by a representative from a law firm as the primary driver of sanctions implementation in the private sector. The same participant also observed that sanctions had brought an unexpected bonus in some cases, as they could be used to trigger ‘force majeure’ on contracts that their clients wanted to terminate with Russian clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from the MFA explained that the ministry had received around 2,000 requests from the private sector for support on interpretation of sanctions regulations, and noted that they had replied to most of them, with the most common questions (and accompanying answers) published on the Ministry of Finance’s website. In contrast, the private sector expressed disappointment at the lack of outreach from the public sector and explained that, while information might be public, authorities should nevertheless approach businesses to raise awareness, provide guidance and support their implementation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives across all sectors also shared concerns related to the evasion risks posed by transactions with regional neighbours of Russia such as Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and China. Representatives of Polish public authorities added that they are unable to collect information from entities abroad without the support of the authorities in the relevant jurisdiction, who can of course refuse to cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the MFA described foreign direct investment (FDI) as a powerful tool to circumvent sanctions, through mechanisms such as the ‘citizen by investment’ schemes (also known as ‘golden passports’). Participants from both public and private sectors also discussed the use of active financial measures, whereby a rival can make strategic use of investments or donations into another state’s economy to gain influence in that society with the underlying intention of undermining its stability. These concerns make the screening of FDI an essential task, and yet participants complained that there is no unified procedure on FDI at EU level. Instead, FDI screening is at the discretion of individual member states, whose current approach, according to the Polish MFA, is to primarily look into investments in specific sectors, such as security or national infrastructure. However, these sectors are not the only ones that can present opportunities for bad actors to gain influence over another country, with participants from both public and private sectors expressing unease about foreign actors financing the targeting of civil society, donating to cultural and educational institutions, or funding extremist political campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives of national authorities explained that they are currently awaiting a judgment from the European Court of Justice regarding Malta’s ‘golden passport’ scheme, also noting that loopholes in the Austrian scheme remain and have not yet been investigated. The EU is taking small steps to regulate investment schemes, through non-binding guidelines rather than via direct regulation. In fact, a representative from the MFA stated that efforts made to improve FDI screening and increase information-sharing come predominantly from the private sector. In this regard, the MFA representative recognised that Poland needs to improve its tools and analytical models to make sure no business under its jurisdiction has connections to a listed entity either in the country or abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;roundtable-recommendations&quot;&gt;Roundtable Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from the public sector expressed a belief that the most significant restrictive measures issued by the EU have been already adopted and there is little need for new sanctions; however, implementation is key and thus the main proposal from this sector is to focus on closing loopholes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision by the EU to de-SWIFT Russian banks was an impactful measure. However, not all Russian banks were banned from SWIFT, which undercuts effectiveness and – as noted in previous SIFMANet roundtables – leaves open a loophole for abuse. A proposal put forth by the Polish MFA during the roundtable was to de-SWIFT all remaining Russian banks. However, representatives from all sectors predicted possible pushback in some cases, noting the reluctance of countries such as Germany or Italy to take measures against Gazprombank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the private sector also agreed on the need to target professional enablers, such as lawyers and accountants, within member states. These actors are supposed to be gatekeepers of the EU’s financial system but, without adequate regulation, they often serve to facilitate active financial measures from rival states and advance the interests of hostile actors in undermining the security and stability of the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from both public and private sectors also voiced concerns over the lack of available measures for taking steps against third countries for hosting Russian assets and/or facilitating evasion. The same participants did note the latest steps taken by the EU towards allowing for the sanctioning of third-country entities, in the most recent revision of Regulation 269. However, representatives from the public sector added that they expect challenges in achieving consensus among all 27 member states over imposing these sanctions, given a historical aversion to extra-territoriality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeking to provide new creative proposals, participants from the private sector discussed leveraging the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to further restrict Russian business. CBAM is a mechanism, expected to be operational from October 2023, through which non-EU businesses must fulfil the climate standards applicable to EU member states in order to import goods into the Union. However, several participants from the public and private sectors doubted the viability of using this tool for the implementation of sanctions, given that its mandate is entirely for environmental purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion also addressed the possibility of instrumentalising the debt that third countries, such as Serbia or Bosnia, have with the EU or the IMF as a means of applying pressure to encourage their compliance with sanctions. However, participants discussed the likelihood that this step would meet countermeasures from affected countries. For example, Turkey could leverage its migrant deal with the EU in retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, attendees agreed that it is crucial to keep political attention and pressure sustained over time to make sanctions effective. To succeed, public sector participants highlighted the need to improve the communication and publicity around sanctions, in particular the impact they are having in restricting the Russian economy, to encourage both citizens and private businesses to commit the necessary resources to ensure sanctions are implemented effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（6日）踏入審訊第20天。區諾軒今繼續接受盤問，庭上首次披露他今年1月在獄中向鄭達鴻撰寫的私人信件，區形容鄭達鴻被公民黨「連累」，又指若非公民黨忽然「搶疆」開記者會（會上楊岳橋承諾若政府不回應五大訴求，會否決所有議案及財政預算案致特首下台），他和李予信的處境會截然不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒又確認，港島區僅在首次會議談及否決預算案，而協調機制初稿文件稱「會積極」運用權力否決僅是戴耀廷看法，用以「迎合」不同意見，「叫唔上係一個共識」；又同意即使初選條款字眼為「會」運用權力否決預算案，也不代表參選人會「無差別」否決，指「狄志遠最近都話佢否決財政預算案」，有被告發笑。法官又問及，當時有沒有參選人認為不應綑綁對否決預算案的立場，區表示：「總有人冇表態，疑點利益應該歸於被告」，多名被告大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒主動補充沈旭暉35交流會-指沈與戴概念好唔同-只望立會過半&quot;&gt;區諾軒主動補充沈旭暉35+交流會 指沈與戴「概念好唔同」 只望立會過半&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒上周五下午開始，接受代表鄭達鴻及梁國雄的資深大律師潘熙盤問，區提及公民黨因有人參選功能組別，對否決財政預算案表達擔心。區諾軒今坐下後即舉起右手，主動向法官提出，想就早前供詞做一點修正和補充。修正方面，區諾軒早前曾稱港島區於2020年6月舉行第4次會議，當時戴耀廷着與會者由一人投4票轉為投1票。區今更正港島於6月並無會議，「4票轉1票」的決定是在5月17日的會議作出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於補充，區上周五曾提及沈旭暉於2020年3月舉行35+交流會，他今指望在辯方盤問前，「完整地講返一次沈旭暉35+交流會個發展。」區指，在2020年，「35+」說法不止戴耀廷有講，沈旭暉亦曾在報章提及，「但個概念係好唔同， 沈旭暉只係期望民主派立會過半。」區指，沈約於3月招聚了一班有興趣參選功能組別的人士作意見交流，該些人後來定期有交流意見，區本人亦有參與其中，包括工程界黃偉信、批發及零售界張秀賢、飲食界林瑞華，及進出口界的本案被告林景楠，但區補充林在6月19日「突然轉為想選新界東」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指功能組別參選人指支持35-但不支持綑綁對預算案立場&quot;&gt;區指功能組別參選人指支持35+ 但不支持綑綁對預算案立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，除林景楠外，其餘各人在7月初陸續召開記者會或表明有意參選，並曾向他表示：「佢哋都支持35+，但係佢哋唔支持就住財政預算案嘅立場有一個捆綁」，並記得黃偉信曾公開講過反對無差別否決財政預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在法官李運騰詢問下，區諾軒指沈只是舉行過首次交流會，之後並無出席功能界別的定期會面，但區本人則有參與其中。他並確認，此為早前在法庭供稱，對否決預算案「有唔同意見」的功能組別參選人士，但不包括衞生服務界，戴耀廷亦只曾就地區直選和超級區議會舉辦協調會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指林瑞華表達對否決預算案有兩難-但不肯定幾大程度代表黨&quot;&gt;區指林瑞華表達對否決預算案有兩難 但不肯定幾大程度代表黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉一度問區是否完成補充，區指「想做埋個結尾」，有被告發笑。區並補充除黃偉信外，至於其他參選功能組別人士有否公開表達反對否決預算案，「因為我還柙兩年，就掌握唔到相關資料。」法官李運騰指他們更關注2020年的情況，區續指是望回答上周潘熙有關公民黨否決預算案立場的問題，並指儘管公民黨於3月25日舉行記者會，但林瑞華想法「一路都係有顧及業界利益」，並曾向他表達過「對於否決預算案有兩難」，惟區指，林的說法「幾大程度代表個黨」需要更多論據支持，柯耀林和彭卓棋等人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方向區諾軒確認錄影謄本內容-遭官打斷指毋需發問&quot;&gt;辯方向區諾軒確認錄影謄本內容 遭官打斷指毋需發問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;資深大律師潘熙其後引述錄影會面謄本，區曾指新界東第二次會議前，社民連黃浩銘曾致電他，指不要胡亂答應就否決預算案達成共識，謄本寫區理解似乎已有人醞釀向大會「逼供」。潘熙欲澄清區的意思是否「逼宮」，惟法官陳慶偉打斷指「OK, move on」，法官陳仲衡亦指意思很明顯，毋需提問，陳慶偉着他要問適合（sensible）的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後又引區諾軒有關九龍西協調會議的錄影會面謄本，指岑子杰曾表示「講抗爭，大家點會唔諗起社民連，不過社民連都係一個濟弱扶傾嘅政黨」，又指不能承諾必定否決財政預算案，因若政府有民生項目如全民退保，「社民連係要贊成。」潘熙向區確認供詞是否正確，惟陳慶偉打斷指已聽取過相關證供，看不到謄本與庭上供詞有任何分別，又指潘熙是資深大律師。陳仲衡亦指「move on」是要「move forward」，不是要兜圈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;港島協調機制初稿稱會積極用權否決預算案-區確認非與會者共識&quot;&gt;港島協調機制初稿稱「會積極」用權否決預算案 區確認非與會者共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後就港島區3月26日首次協調會議發問，指當時戴耀廷雖提及「積極」運用權力否決預算案，但會上是否沒有就此達成共識，法官陳慶偉即指司馬文表達反對。潘熙同意，但指他想知道會議最終是否無達成任何共識，因區諾軒似乎沒有清楚表達。法官陳慶偉指「這是完全清楚的」，陳仲衡亦指他一直理解會上無共識。陳慶偉並向潘熙指，「重複與說服是兩個概念。（“Repetition and persuasion are two different concepts.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後再引區諾軒錄影會面謄本，提及九龍西第二次會議後，他與戴耀廷和趙家賢曾就否決財政預算案的立場討論，區曾指民主黨和社民連表達關注，認為戴「冇理由唔理唔同人嘅睇法而去表達一個咁激進立場」，戴耀廷回覆用「積極」一字，能讓參與者有「唔去否決嘅空間」。潘熙續向區諾軒展示「35+立會過半計劃 民主派港島協調機制（初稿）」的文件，提及「會積極」運用權力否決財政預算案字眼，區確認戴是於首次協調會議後直接傳予他，及向他指有傳予其他參與者，但「那時沒有（港島區 WhatsApp 群）組」，「我唔知佢有冇妥為發畀其他人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，該份文件是否並非代表會上的共識，法官李運騰指該文件涵蓋很多內容，認為潘應想就第二段提問，可直接發問，法官陳慶偉亦提醒「一個籠統的問題只是會換來一個籠統的答案（“A general question attracts a general answer.”）」。潘續改問，文件第二段是否並非會上共識。該段提及參與協調者「認同若民主派能取得立法會一半以上的議席，會積極運用立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求，特赦抗爭者、令相關人士為警暴問責、及重啟政改以達雙普選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱港島僅首次會議觸及否決預算案-叫唔上係一個共識&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱港島僅首次會議觸及否決預算案 「叫唔上係一個共識」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區確認不是與會人士的共識，「因為會議入面有異議」。法官李運騰續指，有趣的是文件名為港島協調機制初稿，但事實上會上並無共識，問區是否知道為何戴耀廷加入該段。區回應，「我會話呢個係戴耀廷嘅共識，就唔係參與者嘅共識」，彭卓棋、陳志全等被告發笑。李運騰指他不明白，因「共識」意指最少兩個人的共識，如何能說是戴耀廷自己有共識。區遂指，因會議過程，「我相信我都講得比較清楚，就係佢（戴耀廷）見到有異議，就用呢個字眼去統攝唔同人嘅觀點。」林卓廷疑惑反問：「統攝？」鄒家成、彭卓棋等發笑。法官陳仲衡提議用「accommodate」翻譯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，是否即戴耀廷希望其他人同意但卻沒有共識，區同意。潘續問，在第二及第三次協調會議後，與會者就否決預算案是否最終沒有達成共識，區回應：「第一次會議有討論，但之後冇再觸及，所以叫唔上係一個共識。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱戴耀廷用會積極字眼統攝不同人觀點-後改用迎合&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱戴耀廷用「會積極」字眼「統攝」不同人觀點 後改用「迎合」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後庭上再提到「accommodate」，傳譯主任一度猶豫如何翻譯，區指可用「統攝」，並說「我忽然諗唔到一啲更簡單嘅字，對唔住」。法官李運騰一度提議用「summarize and capture」，法官陳慶偉則問：「Which 統、which 攝？」林卓廷等被告大笑，區指是「統治個統，收攝個攝、攝影個攝」，再致歉指「諗唔到更易嘅字」。陳慶偉續指，很少聽過此字，認為統指「統一」、攝指「震懾」，或有威嚇控制的意思，又說：「You see, I want to 『統攝』 my staff.」區笑指「我都被威脅」。區其後指，認為以「迎合（accommodate）」來表達其想法較恰當。潘熙一度提議用「包容」，惟陳慶偉再打斷：「No, thank you, next.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;下午休庭後，法官陳仲衡指在午飯時搜尋「統攝」意思，發現有「to exercise control over」或「to govern」的意思，區重申認為「迎合（accommodate）」是較切合的說法，並確認他今早證供應指「迎合」，而非「統攝」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒曾受訪指候選人對35有兩種不同想像&quot;&gt;區諾軒曾受訪指候選人對35+有兩種不同想像&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後展示區諾軒2020年4月的 Facebook 帖文，轉載《蘋果日報》的訪問〈【立法會選舉】民主派或五區齊初選定出線權 區諾軒：以「35+」否定中共極權路線〉，提及：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「區稱，按其觀察，不同派系代表都期望未來能於選舉組合出基本綱領，但具體做法仍未有共識，指公眾或候選人都對『35+』有兩種不同想像。」⋯⋯「其一是透過議會過半提高民主派的議價能力及政治力量，爭取五大訴求，『至於點樣爭取係冇人傾落去嘅，亦都好難去傾，因為牽涉到到時個政治局勢係點』。另一種是不惜攬炒，否決《財政預算案》等向北京施壓，『寧願你（北京）做得最赤祼，咁你唔好再令香港存有任何幻想』。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱簽署墨落無悔減低參選人模糊性走盞空間&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱簽署「墨落無悔」減低參選人「模糊性」、「走盞」空間&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙問，以區理解，是否傳統泛民抱有第一種想像，區同意。法官陳慶偉問是否包括公民黨，區則稱公民黨3月25日召開記者會，「我好難將佢哋歸類落去呢個類入面。」庭上早前播放片段，時任公民黨黨魁楊岳橋曾在記者會承諾若政府不回應五大訴求，公民黨將否決所有議案及財政預算，令行政長官解散立法會重選及辭職。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wYAJZEB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 資料圖片：楊岳橋（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，以區理解，能否說該兩種想法於整個初選過程也持續？區則指兩種立場的角力到6月有變化，「特別係墨落無悔嘅簽署出台啦」，但同意聲明出台後該角力仍然存在。法官陳慶偉問及「墨落無悔」聲明有何意義，區重申民主派有不同光譜的人，「如果有一啲聯署要人表態，會減低個模糊性。」法官李運騰問「模糊性」是否指「彈性」、有空間「走盞」，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區認有候選人提及必定否決財案-惟不肯定誰說&quot;&gt;區認有候選人提及「必定」否決財案 惟不肯定誰說&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後展示新界西協調機制文件，區諾軒早前供稱只有該區用「會」運用權力否決預算案而非「會積極」，認為「會」的意思較為確定。潘熙問2020年3月至6月是否有不同人提議不同字眼，區指看不到其他人在4月至5月時「係咁關注個字眼問題」，指首次出現是新界東5月5日的第二次會議，圍繞使用「會」抑或「會積極」，而「會積極」一字較早出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，是否有其他候選人曾指「必定會否決財政預算案」，區指要視乎當時不同人的公開言論，「我好難話邊個真係咁講，以免不公」，傳繹主任一度問「咩話？」，區說「唔……唔好講」，有被告發笑。區其後在法官陳慶偉詢問下，確認當時有被告曾提出相關說法，但他不確實記得是誰說。法官問及是在什麼場合提到，區指在後來的選舉論壇或競選活動，「的確有部分人有呢個咁嘅主張。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問有沒有人認為不應綑綁否決財案立場-區總有人冇表態疑點利益應該歸於被告&quot;&gt;官問有沒有人認為不應綑綁否決財案立場 區：總有人冇表態，疑點利益應該歸於被告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在盤問下同意，除了「必定會」、「會」及「會積極」否決預算案，尚有第四種主張，即認為不應綑綁參選人對否決預算案的立場。法官李運騰續問，至6月尾7月初的選舉論壇，還有沒有參選人抱持第四種立場，區答：「總有人冇表態嘅，疑點利益應該歸於被告」，多名被告大笑。法官陳慶偉再問，有沒有人曾明確表示該立場，區指是早前提及的功能組別參選人，但其餘人有否說過則「冇掌握」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，即使只使用「會」而非「會積極」字眼，也不代表必定「無差別」否決預算案？區指「我即時都諗到有三個可能」。潘熙一度指不需知道所有可能性，惟法官陳仲衡提醒屆時控方覆問問及時，辯方便沒機會澄清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意會用權否決預算案不代表會無差別否決&quot;&gt;區同意「會」用權否決預算案不代表會「無差別」否決&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續容許區解釋，區指該三個可能分別為「我淨係話我會否決財預算案」、「我會否決財政預算案係為咗爭取五大訴求」及「我乜都唔理，總之我點都係否決財政預算案㗎啦」。法官李運騰問及第一和第三的分別，區解釋就第一點，只是說會否決預算案「可以有好多原因 ，重點係你為咗乜」，又指「狄志遠最近都話佢否決財政預算案」，有被告笑說「嘩」。區諾軒最終再同意潘熙指，即使沒有「積極」一字而只用「會」，也不代表當選者必須「無差別」否決預算案，「所以我會話係為乜（否決）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方展示區諾軒予鄭達鴻信件-指公民黨記招連累鄭及李予信&quot;&gt;辯方展示區諾軒予鄭達鴻信件 指公民黨記招「連累」鄭及李予信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後引述區諾軒今年1月尾寫給鄭達鴻的4頁信件，指控方於2月11日將信件納為「未被使用材料（unused materials）」。庭上展示信件其中一段：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「港島的狀況幸好較其他區好，但始終主要關鍵，是個人的行為、言論。Michael 多言論上硬傷；Clarisse 較好，我猜，你的關口是黨的活動行為連累吧。作為外人，我是不太明白 CP 的人想什麼。佢地三個 PG + 落口供，他們該有和你交流，你也明白此中邏輯吧？（還是根本各顧各的…）問題是，他們說的內容的程度是不足的，大概不去到實質過程、實據，是不行的（看看我）。（註：需陳述主要犯案事實，為司法提供客觀證據…）這裡便牽涉做人道德問題：己所不欲，勿施於人，盡可能也不該傷害到人。可其實你縱觀各資料之多，令我不時想，究竟有同冇人講，係咪已不太有分別…」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙問，以區理解，是否即鄭達鴻的行為不如其黨激進，惟法官陳慶偉指潘熙是要求區諾軒就鄭的思想作供，着他問下一條問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，區指鄭被黨行為「連累」是什麼意思，區指若公民黨曾舉辦一些活動，如3月25日記者會，而鄭達鴻又有參加，「咁的確係一個連累嘅意思嚟」。法官陳仲衡提醒，區諾軒如何理解該記者會與法庭如何理解無關，法官陳慶偉亦着他問另一條問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續引信件最後一頁的一段：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「不知有否和你說過，區某踏入政壇，伊始自 2007 年 CP 實習計劃，不是 DP… 我決定選 DC 時無揀 CP 去左 DP，多少係不太 buy 好民粹主導的路線，不是說 DP 便好，它有它問題，只是聯想到我們的苦難 —— 若 CP 不是 2020 年 3 月不知想什麼忽然『搶疆』開 press con，汝等處境必截然不同，那不是搶民粹又為何？有必要嗎？這也不是你和信可左右，結果誤了你們。當然，我人生裏連累人的也不少，正如 Margaret 說，民主運動總是牽牽絆絆。展望將來，需要的理論基礎更高，也不是沒想過，這兩年，區某讀了很多中國自由派的書藉，我認為將來倘尚有人有志，該學學錢理群、張千帆、章詒和怎樣在內地生存、知進退。只是，區某氣數已盡，此事一過，能否仍立於天地之間，尚未可知，君亦宜珍重、保重。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，「這也不是你和信可左右」中的「信」指李予信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問鄭達鴻有否參與決定召公民黨記者會-區我係一個外人唔知道人哋黨嘅運作&quot;&gt;被問鄭達鴻有否參與決定召公民黨記者會 區：我係一個外人，唔知道人哋黨嘅運作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問就3月25日記者會，區諾軒是否認為鄭達鴻和李予信相較其他公民黨立法會議員譚文豪、郭家麟及楊岳橋，較沒有話語權。法官李運騰指，那是要求證人猜測，反問如何協助其當事人？法官陳慶偉並指若他是潘熙，會問區，舉行記者會是否主要是公民黨黨魁或立法會議員的主意。區答「我係一個外人，我唔知道人哋黨嘅運作」，但「喺得立法會開，就即係立法會議員開啦」。潘熙其後就下一議題發問，惟螢幕仍展示信件，區稱：「不如閂咗封信先啦，如果唔用……私人信件啊」，有被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後問，區諾軒早前作供曾提及「鬥黃」，會否認為公民黨3月25日記者會亦可歸類為「鬥黃」。主控萬德豪指證人無法回答此問題，法官陳慶偉亦指潘熙可以叫其當事人作供，潘指會認真考慮。潘熙再問，以區理解，鄭達鴻是否被迫參與「鬥黃」，再遭法官阻止，李運騰指若辯方無證據顯示證人對此有個人認知，辯方只是問及其意見。潘熙一度改問據區理解，鄭達鴻是否會無差別否決財政預算案，惟陳慶偉再稱「no, next」。李運騰亦指，若潘熙認為證人知道相關事實，便可直接提出，否則其問題會引來異議，陳仲衡亦指潘的問題「突然（out of the blue）」。潘熙一度欲解釋，惟陳慶偉連說四個「next」，潘遂就其他議題發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/D0pdA5d.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（6日）踏入審訊第20天。區諾軒今繼續接受盤問，提及《國安法》前及剛生效後，均相信作為憲法專家的戴耀廷指初選不違法，惟政府7月9日指初選或違法後，他開始「響起問號」，並在初選結束、中聯辦於7月14日譴責初選違法後，不單決定退出初選，「而且盡我全力去解散整個初選」，並向時任政制及內地事務局政治助理吳璟儁徵詢補救措施。區在庭上補充，是在看過《國安法》33條自動放棄犯罪可減輕處罰的條文作此決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區最終於7月15日宣布退出初選工作，趙家賢亦於翌日退出，戴耀廷之後亦宣布休息。區在臨散庭主動提及，他們數人退出後各區有剩餘工作無任何牽頭人能處理，並指希望上述情節，「能夠為整體嘅同案搵到好嘅求情同從輕發落嘅基礎」，有被告面露愕然和發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱參與者國安法可能改變否決財案立場-惟認個人無認知&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱參與者《國安法》可能改變否決財案立場 惟認個人無認知&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒繼續接受辯方盤問。代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的資深大律師潘熙午休前問到，《國安法》落實後，以區理解，初選參與者就否決預算案有否改變立場，區答「可能有，要睇個根據係邊」。控方指是問及意見，法官李運騰遂改問區是否認知有參與者改變立場，區答「有呢個可能，但我的確冇清楚嘅資訊」，他個人亦沒有認知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉再指，若他是潘熙，會向區指出他曾供稱，有候選人在《國安法》後問戴耀廷否決預算案會否違法，可理解為有人對此表達擔心，區同意。陳再補充，但這會否影響他們否決的立場則是另一回事，區亦同意。潘熙再問，至《國安法》公布前，區個人是否不清楚公民黨就否決預算案的立場，區指他「冇進一步資訊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指曾相信否決預算案合法當時確實係冇為意有問題&quot;&gt;區指曾相信否決預算案合法：當時確實係冇為意有問題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙下午續就區認知初選是否違《國安法》盤問，其中戴耀廷曾多次發文指初選不違法，潘展示區諾軒錄影會面謄本，提到「始終戴耀廷係一個香港大學嘅法律教授喇，咁佢有佢嘅專業喇，我諗相信好多人都信任佢嘅專業嘅」，區確認知道戴於2020年已在港大教授近30年、曾任法律系副院長，故當戴耀廷談及對《基本法》理解，「當時我哋都信佢係專業。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後展示戴耀廷於2020年5月12日《明報》文章〈「支持否決」不能成為DQ理由－－再論立會否決財政預算案的憲制設計〉，提及「基本法的條文並沒有規定立法會否決財政預算案只能單純因為財政預算案的內容」，區同意戴嘗試解釋為何認為否決預算案是合法，而他當時沒有質疑戴的看法，因為相信戴是憲法專家。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，當時認為否決預算案令政府回應五大訴求是合法的，並指「我當時確實係冇為意有問題」。至於其他參與者是否都有同樣想法，他指「我冇辦法進入其他人嘅心境」，但不少民主派同事過往多年均否決財政預算案，亦未見有問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後引述2019年5月18日立法會有關《逃犯條例》修訂的會議紀錄，當時區諾軒曾發言指如非必要也「不想以否決預算案作為迫使政府撤回《逃犯條例》修訂建議的手段」，但指「這可以是其中一種做法」，區確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;提名表格有擁護基本法條款-區相信亦盡力確保參選人擁護&quot;&gt;提名表格有擁護《基本法》條款 區：相信亦盡力確保參選人擁護&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後問及初選提名表格，區確認於2020年6月設計。潘引表格條款「我特此聲明，我會擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特別行政區」，並引區諾軒錄影會面謄本談及，「其中有一樣呢，係希望保護返啲參選者喇」，又指希望參與者聲明擁護《基本法》與效忠特區，是「製作呢個表格嘅時候，有拎過出嚟討論嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙問區在2020年6月設計表格時，是否相信參加初選不會違反相關條款。區回應，「我當時相信，亦都盡過力確保大家都係擁護《基本法》同效忠香港特別行政區。」區亦同意當時仍認為運用《基本法》權力否決預算案是合法，至於其他人的想法，他無法代入，但相信不少人分享同樣看法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷國安法後稱初選不違法會繼續-區提底線指官方機構指違法就要考慮停止&quot;&gt;戴耀廷《國安法》後稱初選不違法會繼續 區提底線指官方機構指違法就要考慮停止&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續就《國安法》落實後的情況發問，展示區諾軒書面供詞，提及他「一直很憂慮初選有沒有違法」，和留意政府或官方有否指出初選違法，並向戴反映相關問題，指犯法與否不是他「說了便算」；又指很多候選人曾問戴初選有否違《國安法》，但戴「一直說看不出有違法之處」。區在盤問下同意，戴耀廷在《國安法》落實後指否決預算案不違法，並重申：「法律上佢的確係有佢嘅專業意見，我冇辦法挑戰佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後展示戴耀廷7月1日與趙家賢的 WhatsApp 對話，提及「這是我（戴）給個別團隊的訊息」，指《國安法》後有人擔心會否違法，但戴認為否決預算案是《基本法》賦予立法會的憲制權力，不可能是《國安法》第22條顛覆國家政權下的「非法手段」，特首解散立會亦不構成嚴重干擾和阻撓政權機關依法履行職能；而初選資金全為本地所得，應不會違《國安法》第29條勾結外國勢力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴總結「35+的目標要否決財政預算案，應沒有觸犯國安法 」，並在最後指「我的看法是初選會繼續。對我的想法，你有甚麼意見，敬請告知」，區確認收到該訊息。被問及有何回應，區指「佢給出咗一個法律嘅理解，我給出我嘅政治判斷」，向戴指「合唔合法就唔係佢講咗算嘅」，並提出一條底線，「如果有官方機構話初選係犯法呢，我哋就要考慮停止初選活動啦。」法官李運騰問及，該討論有否在 WhatsApp 記錄，區指沒有，僅他與戴耀廷在該訊息發布後進行對話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾國衛79指初選或違法-區指信戴法律觀點惟政治上開始響問號&quot;&gt;曾國衛7.9指初選或違法 區指信戴法律觀點惟政治上開始響問號&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙再引戴耀廷7月7日《蘋果日報》文章〈民主派 35+ 初選會否觸犯國安法〉，及7月9日時任政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞指初選或違《國安法》後，戴耀廷的 Facebook 回應，均強調否決預算案是《基本法》賦權，不會違《國安法》。法官陳仲衡留意到後者無提令特首下台，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙再引述7月9日初選記者會，區曾指「冇諗過」民主派做團結協調的工作亦會被指違法，又指搞初選多年，「卻喺今次要用一啲咁嚴重嘅指控去恐嚇參與嘅香港市民」，指會「盡我哋最大嘅努力去處理今次情況」，戴耀廷會上亦再次指初選不違法。潘熙問，區當時是否仍信初選不違法，區再重申：「法律上我信任咗戴耀廷當時既觀點，政治上，我開始響起問號，呢個係基於我嘅政治判斷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指仍辦初選因對法律未有正確認識沒足夠時間冷靜思考&quot;&gt;區指仍辦初選因對法律未有正確認識、沒足夠時間冷靜思考&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續解釋，當時「一啲親建制嘅輿論，作出咗一定程度嘅指控」，而若官方機構都開始指控，他認為「政治上是一個警號」。法官陳仲衡問，既然政府初選前已指初選或違法，為何當時仍繼續舉行，區解釋「我當時的確對法律未有正確認識，舉例說非法手段係乜嘢」，而且「初選當時已經如箭在弦」，7月9日舉行記者會、翌日警方已到香港民研搜證、11及12日已是初選，「我的確冇足夠嘅時間冷靜思考。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱不少人問戴耀廷初選是否違法-但無仔細問否決財案是否違法&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱不少人問戴耀廷初選是否違法 但無仔細問否決財案是否違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，截止初選投票日，記者和參加者不時問戴耀廷初選是否違法，但各人問題都「泛泛而談」，「未必去到否決財政預算案咁詳細，只係問犯唔犯法」，亦不記得誰發問。他又提到，戴耀廷對是否違法的回應包括《國安法》第29條勾結外國勢力，「咁所以當時趙家賢係用過好多努力去睇嗰啲資金有冇問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙一度問，直至2020年7月，是否不同人在《國安法》下有不同關注，惟控方指問題籠統，法官李運騰亦指不同人必然對事情有不同看法。潘熙改指出，至7月11日，香港民研鍾庭耀曾關注初選是否違《國安法》，區同意，亦同意戴回應參選人提問指初選不違法，但理解沒有參選人詳細問及「否決財政預算案」會否違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區於中聯辦譴責初選違法後決定退出-指曾約見吳璟儁問補救措施&quot;&gt;區於中聯辦譴責初選違法後決定退出 指曾約見吳璟儁問補救措施&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後引中聯辦7月14日發表的〈嚴厲譴責反對派策動非法初選 破壞立法會選舉公平 決不允許外部勢力操控香港政治事務〉，指初選違法，問區是否在該聲明發出後決定退出初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區回應：「我唔單止係退出，而且盡我全力去解散整個初選」，指他在聲明發出後已決定將整個組織初選的機構停止工作。區指，他第一步嘗試約見時任政制及內地事務局政治助理吳璟儁，徵詢任何補救措施，並主動建議若組織者一起退出是否可行做法，而據其憶述，吳回應「只能夠盡量做」。區指，他其後往戴耀廷港大辦公室指應要退出和解散初選，戴當時指「要啲時間諗一諗」。區並將決定告知趙家賢，趙指只要區退出，他當日亦會退出，結果區於7月15日退出初選後，趙於7月16日亦宣布退出，戴耀廷之後亦宣布休息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指決定退出因國安法指自動放棄犯罪可減輕處罰&quot;&gt;區指決定退出因《國安法》指自動放棄犯罪可減輕處罰&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區解釋，當時在 Facebook 發文宣布退出35+工作，並記得是早上9時，在西九龍法院審理8.18流水式集會案前。法官李運騰一度問，當日亦有抗爭派發表聲明，問哪者為先，區指是其帖文先發出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指有一點想說清楚，指他「當時睇咗國安法第33條(1)」，而作出此決定。根據《國安法》第33條(1)，「在犯罪過程中，自動放棄犯罪或者自動有效地防止犯罪結果發生的」，能使「對有關犯罪行為人、犯罪嫌疑人、被告人可以從輕、減輕處罰；犯罪較輕的，可以免除處罰」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱希望所述情節能為整體同案搵到好嘅求情同從輕發落嘅基礎&quot;&gt;區稱希望所述情節能為整體同案「搵到好嘅求情同從輕發落嘅基礎」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，以區理解，當時中聯辦是否沒有清楚解釋初選為何違法，區指「佢哋係表達過佢哋嘅觀點」，而他當時已覺得，「無論如何都要停止個工作」。潘熙亦問及「親建制輿論」是否無解釋為何初選違法，區再指他們有很多觀點，「但你唔知邊個觀點先係權威。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，但區曾任立法會議員，是否不需戴耀廷意見，都知道可根據《基本法》權力否決預算案，區同意，但指始終戴耀廷是港大法律系教授，曾參與《基本法》起草委員會諮詢，「我作為後輩，佢係有權威。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙再展示戴耀廷7月14日 Facebook 帖文，對中聯辦稱初選是「典型的涉嫌犯法」，嚴正指出完全不合常理，區指在網上看過相關文章，但沒有在當天見戴耀廷時談及。區其後主動指出，「我淨係想就住退出嗰度做一句補充啫」，指他們幾個主要人士退出後，「喺香港島、九龍西同埋新界東其實仲有一啲剩餘嘅工作，結果係冇任何牽頭嘅人可以處理得到，可以查閱得到 WhatsApp 紀錄入面嘅對話」。他並指：「我希望上述嘅情節，能夠為整體嘅同案搵到好嘅求情同從輕發落嘅基礎」，鄒家成一臉愕然，其後發笑，鄭達鴻、何桂藍等人也有發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件周三（8日）下午續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今踏入審訊第19天。區諾軒下午開始接受盤問，庭上披露其錄影會面紀錄，區曾提及不同光譜的民主派對如何落實五大訴求有不同看法，未必想特首下台或癱瘓政府；又指2020年2月與公民黨會面，當時有功能組別議員的公民黨對否決財政預算案表達擔心，認為會對該些議員構成很大壓力。惟被問及公民黨2020年是否一直抱有同樣看法，區則稱「唔能夠咁武斷」，只能講及該次會議的意見。區在盤問下又承認，2021年7月至8月共錄取了7次錄影會面，並曾獲警方開啟其手機「行事曆」以整理供詞。他亦首次透露2020年3月曾舉行「沈旭暉35+交流會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒21年7月錄首份口供-稱民主派對實踐五大訴求手段有不同看法&quot;&gt;區諾軒21年7月錄首份口供 稱民主派對實踐五大訴求手段有不同看法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上周已完成主問的區諾軒，今午開始接受辯方盤問，由代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的資深大律師潘熙開始。潘熙先指出，區諾軒於2021年7月至8月曾錄取共7次錄影會面，分別在7月27日錄取第一次、8月3日錄取第二及三次、8月6日錄取第四、五及六次、8月12日錄取第六次，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後引區諾軒首次錄影會面謄本，談及於2020年2月會見公民黨梁家傑的情況。區提及，後來就如何落實五大訴求引發「好重點嘅爭議」，因當時戴耀廷的說法很細緻和具體，但對很多「民主派」的人物來說，「佢哋嘅諗法只不過係讓到更加多民主派代表進入議會」，可能不斷「講五大訴求嘅說話」，但不一定服膺於「特首下台」或「癱瘓政府」的想法。區表示，實踐的手段根據不同政治光譜會有不同想法，但當時一直都未有釐清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒在盤問下，同意當時提及的「民主派」是包括公民黨及社民連，並同意早前曾供稱民主派有傳統泛民、激進泛民和本土派等不同光譜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱公民黨有功能組別議員-對否決預算案提出擔心&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱公民黨有功能組別議員 對否決預算案提出擔心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續就2020年2月區諾軒和戴耀廷與公民黨執委會見面盤問，區承認當時「分唔到邊個係當時嘅執委」，但他提到出席的梁家傑、譚文豪、余若薇、陳淑莊和賴仁彪5人都是「有影響力嘅人物」，並在法官陳慶偉詢問下，指被告鄭達鴻當時「不在場」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FWAjVJJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄭達鴻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒同意，當時會上除了陳淑莊指公民黨望推林瑞華參選功能組別飲食界，亦有提及郭榮鏗是法律界議員。潘熙再引述區諾軒錄影會面謄本，提及當時公民黨有「提出過一啲擔心」：「如果你話係人人都要走去否決呢個財政預算案嘅⋯⋯咁你咪搞到佢哋（功能組別議員）好大壓力囉。」區解釋，功能組別議員「好難會背棄業界去否決財政預算案」，如政府大幅撥款增聘教師，教育界立法會議員亦「好難話去否定呢樣嘢」，故公民黨有此擔心。區亦形容，該說法當時在民主黨、公民黨和社民連，「都不時聽到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意否決預算案困難視乎政見-20年3月曾舉行沈旭暉35交流會&quot;&gt;區同意否決預算案困難視乎政見 20年3月曾舉行「沈旭暉35+交流會」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，當時公民黨擔心的事情，其他政黨是否都有同樣看法，舉例社民連曾指預算案若包括全民退休保障，社民連會投贊成。區表示，岑子杰和代表梁國雄的陳寶瑩在協調會議上都表達過相關看法。潘熙續指，事實上否決財政預算案的困難亦同樣適用於地區直選和功能組別，視乎相關人士政見，區同意。潘再問該種擔心是否至2020年5月尾至6月初仍存在，區指若根據協調會議的情況，他會說至5月中仍存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後引區諾軒第五份錄影會面謄本，提及6月初一個交流會，林瑞華亦有出席，會上林指他雖屬公民黨，但亦積極考慮參選飲食界，有表達過同樣的「關心」和「憂慮」。區同意，該「關心」是他上述所說，不能很輕易地同意否決財政預算案。區並主動補充，雖稱該交流會於6月發生，「但係睇返我嘅行事曆，發生呢件事原來係2020年3月」，在「沈旭暉 35+ 交流會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問公民黨是否整個2020年抱持同樣擔心-區唔能夠咁武斷&quot;&gt;官問公民黨是否整個2020年抱持同樣擔心 區：唔能夠咁武斷&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，以區理解，能否說整個2020年，公民黨對於無差別否決財政預算案都不能有整體立場，此時主控周天行起身，質疑證人不能回答此問題。法官陳慶偉亦指該問題並不是很好，並直接問區，以他理解，公民黨是否在2020年一直抱有同樣的看法，區回應：「唔能夠咁武斷。」潘熙續指，那區稱公民黨的「擔心」，最遲於何時仍持續，能否說直至2020年7月仍持續？區回應：「我只能夠講係該次會議佢哋嘅意見，就難以推論佢後邊嘅諗法有冇轉變。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱曾獲警方展示手機行事曆&quot;&gt;區稱曾獲警方展示手機「行事曆」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰其後問及，區諾軒提到的沈旭暉會議，是先或後於3月25日的公民黨記者會舉行，區答：「我冇行事曆喺手，但係就我憶述，應該未過該次3月25號嘅記者招待會」，即沈的會議早於公民黨記者會。法官陳仲衡問及該「行事曆」，區解釋「喺整理我嘅供詞嘅時候，我曾經獲警方開啟返我嘅手機，睇得返案發時每一日我做啲乜」，並確認要答李運騰的問題，需要重看其手機。案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃碧雲林卓廷僅同意與自己相關的事實&quot;&gt;黃碧雲林卓廷僅同意與自己相關的事實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方昨日讀出其中13名被告的同意事實，今早分別讀出黃碧雲、何桂藍和林卓廷的同意事實，3份內容均較13人的一份為少，而黃碧雲和林卓廷的內容又比何桂藍一份為少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中由大律師沈士文代表的黃碧雲和林卓廷，僅同意與他們本人相關的事實，包括他們分別於6月20日及19日向民主動力提交提名表格、於6月25日及28日參與初選論壇、及向選舉事務處提交選舉單張和參與初選。二人又同意其個人發布的帖文、文章和片段，被捕後家中及電子器材被檢取的證物，及案發時個人的背景，包括黃碧雲案發時為立法會議員，任期於2020年12月1日結束，而林卓廷兼任立法會議員及區議員，立會任期於同日結束。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於其他所有被告發布的帖文、影片及行為，如戴耀廷、區諾軒和吳政亨的文章，吳政亨發起「三投三不投」的過程，趙家賢被搜得的 WhatsApp 對話，其他被告報名參與初選及獲發按金收據，抗爭派記者會及相關立場聲明，報名參選、被DQ和沒有報名參選立法會的被告名單，及其他被告的背景、拘捕和搜獲的物料等，均沒有在二人同意事實提及。其他組織如民主動力和香港民意研究所的資料，以及參與舉辦初選論壇的媒體等，二人亦沒有同意。不過二人有同意警方於2020年12月，向《獨立媒體》、《立場新聞》、《蘋果日報》發出提交物料令。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，同意事實提及黃碧雲於「2020年7月1日至2021年1月7日」，在香港沒有案底，法官陳仲衡一度關注該寫法，是指被告該段時間沒有案底，抑或直至當時沒有案底，控方回應是後者，遂將所有被告承認事實的寫法改為「直至2021年1月7日」沒有案底。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍同意事實不包括戴耀廷文章抗爭派記者會&quot;&gt;何桂藍同意事實不包括戴耀廷文章、抗爭派記者會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於何桂藍，同意事實與13被告大致相同，包括吳政亨發起「三投三不投」、民主動力和香港民研的資料等，惟不包括所有戴耀廷的文章、Facebook 帖文和 YouTube 片段；各被告發布「墨落無悔」的帖文及其他競選帖文和影片；7月15日抗爭派記者會的出席名單及其後發布的〈抗爭派立法會參選人立場聲明〉；及警方向媒體發出的提交物料令。代表何的大律師 Trevor Beel 在首兩周審訊曾表示，戴耀廷不會出庭作供，質疑其文章僅屬「傳聞證供」，控方須證明涉案文章由戴所寫；又指無證據何曾出席抗爭派記者會及在會上發言。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍同意事實不包括被捕後搜得的物料&quot;&gt;何桂藍同意事實不包括被捕後搜得的物料&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就初選論壇，何桂藍只同意2020年6月5日至7月4日曾舉行初選論壇，但沒有同意舉辦論壇的媒體及論壇出席者。何的同意事實亦提及所有其他被告被捕後被搜得的證物，唯獨不包括從她本人搜得的物料，她亦不同意證物鏈。Beel 表示，任何從何桂藍搜得的物品都不會同意，會要求傳召警員舉證，又指不明白為何「T裇」也相關，惟李運騰指，附表沒提「T裇」，只是與競選有關的物品。Beel 又提到，並不同意任何被告報名立法會選舉後被裁定無效，但控方並無回應其修訂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍修改至直至2021年12月無案底12人改為至2023年3月無案底&quot;&gt;何桂藍修改至直至2021年12月無案底、12人改為至2023年3月無案底&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，何桂藍的同意事實，原列明「直至2021年1月7日」何沒有案底，惟辯方提出望改為「直至2021年12月12日」。法官李運騰問及，法庭是否要考慮何桂藍擁有良好品格，又問在同意事實加入該段落有何用意，主控萬德豪指若被告在本案發生後再犯案，或不能視為具良好品格。法官陳仲衡提及，被告於案發期間犯案會影響法庭對其犯罪傾向的評估，但於案發後、開審前犯案，又會否影響對其犯罪傾向的評估？萬德豪指，此情況被告亦會被視為有案底。李運騰續指不希望知道詳情，法庭亦只會考慮同意事實上的資訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方休庭後再提出修訂，將昨日13名被告同意事實有關案底的描述，由「2020年7月1日至2021年1月7日」沒有案底，改為「直至2023年3月3日」，鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信、吳政亨、鄒家成及余慧明12人均沒有案底，不包括梁國雄。&lt;/p&gt;

The shortfall adversely affected not only traditional industries like automobiles but also other devices that incorporate a complement of semiconductor technologies — including microprocessors, advanced microcontrollers, analog and mixed-signal products, and power semiconductors — and drive displays, decode audio, operate engines, and perform other key functions. The absence of these components created significant disruptions in the U.S. economy, prompting a deeper look at the strategic significance of so-called legacy chips.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-legacy-chips&quot;&gt;What Are “Legacy” Chips?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Legacy” or “mainstream” semiconductor-based integrated circuits (ICs) are made using established — but still evolving — manufacturing processes, typically with larger transistors etched on each chip. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 defines legacy devices as those produced with 28-nanometer (nm) technology or larger, and it tasks the Department of Commerce with formulating a precise definition for other types of chips. That determination is still pending. The official definition of “cutting-edge” chips has also yet to be formulated but can be assumed to apply to process nodes at or below 5 nm. The highly advanced 10 nm and 7 nm chips are in a definitional gray area, at least until the Department of Commerce categorizes them. Even then, this is a static distinction in a technology that is still following a trajectory predicted by Moore’s Law: what is considered “legacy” today was cutting-edge not long ago, and what is cutting-edge today is destined to become tomorrow’s legacy chip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legacy chips are ubiquitous. While cutting-edge chips or microprocessors have widespread applications in critical technologies, legacy chips are involved in the production of most automobiles, aircraft, home appliances, broadband, consumer electronics, factory automation systems, military systems, and medical devices. These devices have a central role in the U.S. manufacturing economy, meaning disruptions in the availability of legacy chips negatively impact U.S. manufacturing and downstream economic activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the name, legacy chips are not stale technology. The connotations associated with terms like “mature,” “older,” and “legacy” are misleading because these categories of chips are constantly being refined for new requirements and applications. Innovations in these chips, for example, include the use of silicon carbide semiconductors, which are expected to have an important role in decarbonizing the economy. Legacy chips are destined to remain highly relevant to emerging industries and technologies far into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;These devices have a central role in the U.S. manufacturing economy, meaning disruptions in the availability of legacy chips negatively impact U.S. manufacturing and downstream economic activities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, identifying legacy chips as separate from leading-edge chips in terms of transistor size may limit our understanding of their strategic and economic importance. The term “legacy” is itself a holdover from an era when military applications were a driving force in chip innovation. Reflecting this mindset, recent export controls aimed at limiting China’s potential to manufacture advanced chips — leaving China to innovate in mainstream chips — mask a major vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States is to protect its economy from the impact of Chinese industrial policy, U.S. strategic thinkers can no longer categorize chips as “advanced” or “less advanced” purely in terms of the size of their components. Instead, policymakers must think more carefully about the importance of specialized legacy chips and policies supporting their production and continued innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-of-the-2022-legacy-chip-shortage&quot;&gt;Impact of the 2022 Legacy Chip Shortage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s widespread awareness of legacy chips was spurred by a shortage of chips during the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite operating at historic output at that time, the domestic production base was not able to keep pace with domestic demand. In early 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce released the results of a survey addressing the chip shortage and found that firms faced their most acute shortages not in cutting-edge chips but in legacy chips at the 40 nm node or larger. Most current U.S. chip production — and most global production — consists of these higher-node devices. By the beginning of 2022, according to Department of Commerce survey, U.S. chip plants were operating at 90 percent capacity or higher, “incredibly high for a production process that requires regular maintenance and very high amounts of energy.” Despite the demand, chipmakers were simply incapable of increasing output over the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2021 Biden administration review of the U.S. semiconductor supply chain found that “the United States relies on sources concentrated in Taiwan, South Korea, and China to meet demand for various non-leading-edge memory and logic chips that are used widely in myriad consumer and industrial applications.” In 2022, the Department of Commerce concluded — based on a survey of over 150 U.S. companies that produce and consume semiconductors — that a chip shortage was “threatening American factory production and helping to fuel inflation.” Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said on January 25, 2022, that “it’s alarming, really, the situation we’re in as a country, and how urgently we need to move to increase our domestic capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering semiconductors take many months to manufacture — with typical automotive microcontrollers taking six to nine months — current supplies reflect 2022 boosts in production volume, and the market now faces an oversupply for certain kinds of chips. However, the auto industry still faces a shortage of semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;supplying-the-us-automotive-industry&quot;&gt;Supplying the U.S. Automotive Industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience of the U.S. automotive industry in recent months provides important lessons regarding the importance of legacy chips for car and truck production and related economic activity. The U.S. automobile industry relies almost entirely on legacy chips, which account for 95 percent of its total semiconductor consumption. This is because chips used in the automobile industry must achieve “automotive-grade” function: the chip’s ability to endure punishing environments characterized by extreme temperatures, moisture, dust, chemicals, vibration, and electronic interference. This requires far more robust and near “zero-defect” performance than chips found in advanced consumer electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the auto industry has suffered the most from the recent legacy chip shortage. Starting in 2020, shortages and long wait times for automotive-grade legacy semiconductors crippled U.S. auto production. Despite claims that the chip supply problem was due to pandemic disruptions to global supply chains, surging global demand for chips during the pandemic and “just-in-time” optimized automotive supply chains were more to blame. U.S. automakers, expecting a sharp pandemic-induced decline in demand, had canceled their existing contracts for chips. To their surprise, the pandemic brought about an unprecedented swell in the demand for consumer electronics and work-from-home devices, leading to a global shortage for the chips that drive them. As a result, between the beginning of 2021 and mid-2022, North American auto producers were unable to access additional devices and were obliged to cut 4.3 million vehicles out of their production schedules. Prices of available semiconductors also rose substantially, aggravating inflation. The price per unit of common varieties of microcontrollers, for example, quintupled from the fall of 2020 to the fall of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is not always appreciated, today’s automobile industry incorporates semiconductors into the most basic functions of a vehicle. The average number of chips per vehicle doubled between 2017 and 2021 to about 1,700, and this number will only continue to increase as cars and trucks incorporate new safety features and automated driving capabilities. According to one estimate, the total value of the global automotive semiconductor market will grow from $38.7 billion in 2020 to $116.6 billion by 2030, or a compound annual growth rate of 11.7 percent. However, keeping aside cyclical supply issues, the output of semiconductors for automotive applications is simply not keeping pace. Legacy chip production capacity is only expanding at roughly 2 percent annually. For comparison, production capacity for the semiconductor industry as a whole increased by 10 percent per year on average from 2010 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;underinvestment-and-lost-capacity&quot;&gt;Underinvestment and Lost Capacity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the auto sector, this underinvestment has been particularly acute with respect to analog devices, which process information along gradients rather than just according to on and off signals. STMicroelectronics NV, one of the world’s largest makers of analog chips, forecasts that its backlog of automotive orders will “continue to exceed existing and anticipated manufacturing capacity through 2023.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More generally, the U.S. chip industry is losing the capability to produce some types of legacy devices altogether. This is not a reflection of technical hurdles but rather of the fact that older fabs are closing down and not being replaced given the associated difficulties. According to a report by the Congressional Research Service, many legacy chips are produced in fabs that are only able to process 200-milimeter (mm) wafers, not the current-generation 300 mm wafers made in newer fabs. To complicate matters, the report mentions that “equipment to make 200 mm chips is no longer readily available.” As a result, firms are hesitant to make new investments in fabs making “old” chips, which can only achieve the required profit margins if produced on depreciated equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This diminution in capacity means that there is no “silver bullet” solution to the chip shortage in the auto sector, not least because the needs of the industry are growing rapidly. Going forward, virtually all the forecasted growth in automotive chip demand will be with respect to devices needed for electrification, autonomous driving, and connectivity — and over two-thirds of the chips required for these applications will consist of legacy nodes through 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-impact-of-the-shortage&quot;&gt;The Impact of the Shortage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supply constraints have disrupted U.S. automakers’ operations as well as affected many other U.S. manufacturing sectors. Medical device producers, for example, suffered from the shortage of mature chips needed to power their machines. The limited availability of chips forced “companies into the spot market to buy electronic components . . . making it difficult for patients to get some critical devices.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shortage of mature chips also affected makers of electronic consumer products. In 2021, Apple was forced to curtail its production plans for iPhones and other devices because of shortages. With respect to the iPhone 13 Pro Max, a highly complex device incorporating over 2,000 components, the shortfall did not occur with respect to the most advanced chips. Instead, shortages in peripheral components costing just a few cents — such as power management chips made by Texas Instruments, transceivers from Nexperia, and connectivity devices from Broadcom — held up production. Importantly, “such chips are not unique to the iPhone, to smartphones, or even to consumer electronics, but are used across computers, data centers, home appliances, and connected cars.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lagging-investments-in-legacy-chips&quot;&gt;Lagging Investments in Legacy Chips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major source of chip shortages is simply a lack of investment. For several years, investment in the capacity to manufacture legacy chips has lagged far behind demand. The explanation is straightforward: returns are much lower on investments in the production of legacy chips. At present, only about one-sixth of all semiconductor investment is directed toward legacy chip manufacturing. Despite these risks, several major semiconductor device makers are now pursuing investment strategies aimed at producing higher-node chips, including Infineon, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments, and NXP Semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tension exists between public investments in manufacturing capability for the most advanced chips and the need for additional capacity for more mature devices, forcing policymakers to reconcile conflicting demands for the allocation of public resources. The dilemma has been most evident in the European Union, which has committed €43 billion for advanced chip research and production. In March 2022, Intel announced plans to invest €30 billion, with substantial public support, to build a fab in Magdeburg, Germany, using the most advanced chip manufacturing technology. European manufacturing executives have been critical of these investments in fab construction. They argue that devices made at the 5, 3, and 2 nm process nodes contemplated for the Intel project are best suited for “high-volume, highest performance uses such as smartphones and servers.” According to the executives, these chips “would not match the needs of European industry,” which requires legacy chips for applications in sectors such as automobiles, machinery, and process industries (e.g., chemical or pharmaceutical). One European executive commented that “the narrative that everything will converge to less than five nanometers is a false statement. The main innovation for the auto industry is happening on mature nodes. They need to be very energy-efficient and safe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France and Germany have reportedly secured a compromise agreement that will allow older chips to qualify for state aid, as long as they bring an “innovative element” to manufacturing or the final product, which would make Intel’s legacy chip fabs eligible for EU subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same tensions were evident in the United States during the 2021–2022 policy debates over legislation that ultimately became the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. The act became law in August 2022, committing $52 billion in federal funds to promoting investments and research in the domestic semiconductor industry. A coalition of senators secured a cut-out of $2 billion in incentives explicitly meant to subsidize the production of legacy chips. The Biden administration also later clarified that the Department of Commerce would allocate approximately $10 billion of CHIPS funding to expand “new manufacturing capacity for mature and current-generation chips, new and specialty technologies, and for semiconductor industry suppliers.” Such incentives are necessary to incentivize private investment in lower-margin fabs producing higher-node chips, but whether the public funds allocated will prove sufficient to meet the growing need is an open question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Japan, virtually all current demand for semiconductors is for the higher-node chips needed by the auto and consumer electronics industries. In 2021, Taiwan’s TSMC and Japan’s Sony Group announced they would invest $7 billion to build a chip plant in Japan to address the need for older-generation chips. The plant is expected to become operational in 2024. Auto parts maker Denso and Sony will take minority stakes. TSMC is reportedly considering building a second fab in Japan to support the transition of the auto industry to electric and autonomous vehicles, which will require access to increasing numbers of cutting-edge chips. Japan is also reportedly working with the United States to establish a fab capable of producing 2 nm devices beginning in fiscal year 2025. Current partners include IBM and Rapidus, a Japanese consortium that includes Sony, NEC, Toyota, Softbank, Kioxia, and MUFG Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-china-risk&quot;&gt;The China Risk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from low margins, another major risk factor facing U.S. companies considering legacy chip investments is China. The Chinese government recently announced a $143 billion investment in its chip industry. The Chinese semiconductor industry is expected to have spent $12.3 billion and $15.3 billion on capital expenditure in 2021 and 2022 respectively, accounting for 15 percent of the global total. China is projected to nearly double its installed wafer capacity over the next 10 years to reach approximately 19 percent of worldwide installed chip capacity — assuming it can acquire the necessary manufacturing equipment. Analysis from the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) notes that “Chinese EDA firms now have increasingly robust offerings for legacy chips, and domestic Chinese equipment firms are on track to provide strong capabilities for mature node (40/28 nm) production over the next few years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the Western embargo on advanced chip technologies to China, most of the new investments will likely be in the production of older (28 nm and above) devices. An unintended consequence of U.S. export controls on advanced chip technology to China may be a wave of state-backed investment leading to overproduction and, potentially, Chinese dominance of global legacy chip production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. experts have already highlighted the risk of this potential Chinese dominance. Former deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger observed that a Chinese buildup of legacy chip-making capacity would “give Beijing coercive leverage over every country and industry — military or civilian — that depend on 28-nanometer chips, and that’s a big, big chunk of the chip universe.” Dan Hutcheson, another semiconductor expert, observed that “the Chinese could just flood the market with these technologies. Normal companies can’t compete, because they can’t make money at these levels.” Of course, state-owned and state-financed companies benefiting from new equipment do not have to make a profit. They can and likely will focus on market share, cutting foreign companies’ revenues and the resources they need to invest. This will leave authorities in market economies with little choice but to block exports of “dumped” chips or see the industry suffer the fate of the photovoltaic industry, with a loss of sales, revenue, jobs, and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;An unintended consequence of U.S. export controls on advanced chip technology to China may be a wave of state-backed investment leading to overproduction and, potentially, Chinese dominance of global legacy chip production.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the importance of legacy chips for the operation of the modern economy will only continue to grow. Maintaining a robust and resilient supply base able to make the investments and to produce and improve constantly higher node chips is essential for the nation’s competitiveness and economic security. Moreover, innovation in the higher-node chips is expected to serve as the foundation for a variety of emerging technologies, including those necessary to bring us to a greener, healthier planet. More advanced, higher-node chips will be needed to produce green energy technologies, a domain that neither Europe nor the United States can afford to surrender.&lt;/p&gt;

These export controls were designed after consultation with key U.S. allies, but the U.S. originally implemented them unilaterally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a major diplomatic gamble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of rapidly advancing Chinese AI and semiconductor capabilities, the United States wanted to move fast, so it was willing to take the risk of moving first alone. The United States has the strongest overall position in the global semiconductor industry, and it was by itself strong enough to reshape the Chinese semiconductor industry in the short term. Over the medium to long term, however, this move could have backfired disastrously if other countries, particularly Japan and the Netherlands, moved to fill the gaps in the Chinese market that the partial U.S. exit left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is not going to happen. In late January 2023, the Biden administration’s gamble paid off when the United States secured a deal with both the Netherlands and Japan to join in the new semiconductor export controls. Some officials suggested to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) that the result of the dialogues is better characterized as an “understanding” rather than a formal deal, as some details have yet to be worked out. Regardless, the United States has secured the top three international partners needed to ensure the policy’s success. Taiwan had already made a public announcement that it would support enforcement of the October 7 regulation’s application of the U.S. Foreign Direct Product (FDP) rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the exact contours of the deal with the Netherlands and Japan are not yet publicly known. China has aggressively used trade restrictions in the past as a coercive and punitive tool of foreign policy, and all parties to the deal remain tight-lipped, likely in the hopes that this will diminish China’s appetite for retaliation. No doubt the White House would love to have had a big photo-op signing ceremony to show how its gamble on allied diplomacy paid off, but the Biden administration has remained remarkably leak-proof on the topic. The lack of leaks is happening for the same reason the administration was able to pull the deal off: they take allies’ concerns — including a desire for secrecy — seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, journalists and semiconductor companies have struggled in vain over the past few weeks to gain clarity on the elements of the deal. The full details are unlikely to be known until the Dutch and Japanese governments publish their updated export controls regulations, which will take months. In the case of Dutch export controls, some types of policy changes might never be published at all, such as changing the policy for reviewing certain types of export license applications from “case by case” to “presumption of denial.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, however, there are plenty of clues to the deal’s contents from a careful analysis of three elements: (1) the role that Dutch and Japanese companies play in the global semiconductor value chain, (2) the revealed policy preferences of the Biden administration based on the content of the October 7 regulations, and (3) the nature of the underlying legal authorities that constitute the Dutch export controls system. This paper addresses each in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-role-of-dutch-and-japanese-companies-in-the-global-semiconductor-value-chain&quot;&gt;The Role of Dutch and Japanese Companies in the Global Semiconductor Value Chain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The semiconductor value chain includes three major segments: chip design, fabrication (i.e., chip wafer manufacturing), and assembly and testing. See Figure 1 for a simplified depiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qr6XZ4E.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Simplified Depiction of the Semiconductor Value Chain.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ own creation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has the strongest overall position in the global semiconductor industry, but that is as a leader of a deeply interwoven multinational value chain in which other countries also play critical roles and possess technological capabilities that are extremely difficult to replace. The October 7 export controls restricted U.S. sales across multiple segments of the value chain, but the lynchpin of the entire policy is the fact that U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment is an essential part of nearly every single Chinese chip factory. There are multiple categories of equipment — such as deposition, etching, and process control — in which U.S. companies are either exclusive or dominant suppliers, and China’s domestic semiconductor equipment industry is tiny and generally far behind that of the United States. The regulations identified 11 specific types of advanced semiconductor equipment (equipment that is only used for producing advanced chips) where there is no foreign substitute for U.S. technology. Some of these equipment types are among the most complicated and precise machines used anywhere in the global economy. Each represents an extremely tall technology mountain that China must climb to reach its goal of a self-sufficient semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States moved first for two reasons: First, to move fast. Chinese chip companies were purchasing equipment as quickly as they could in anticipation of future export controls. Second, the United States wanted to prove that it was not going to ask allies to bear any costs that it was unwilling to bear itself. The long-term success of the policy required multilateral cooperation, most urgently from the Netherlands and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration correctly assessed that the United States was, by itself, strong enough to reshape the Chinese semiconductor industry in the short term. However, Dutch and Japanese companies possess advanced technological capabilities in highly related disciplines. Whereas it would have likely taken China, by itself, decades to replace the equipment that the United States is no longer willing to sell, assistance from the Netherlands or Japan could have had China back up and running in as little as a year or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry has seen ever-increasing market consolidation as the cost and complexity of remaining competitive at the state of the art has soared. For the equipment categories in which the United States is dominant, Dutch and Japanese companies have increasingly found head-to-head competition with U.S. firms unattractive. It would have taken Dutch and Japanese companies billions or tens of billions of dollars in research and development (R&amp;amp;D) costs to produce products that might capture only meager and highly unprofitable market share. However, the October 7 export controls could have changed that calculus. With U.S. companies prohibited from competing in the large and growing Chinese market, Dutch and Japanese companies might have found monopoly access to China attractive enough to justify the equipment R&amp;amp;D expense for new product lines to replace U.S. ones. Once successfully established in China, Dutch and Japanese companies might have been in a position to more effectively compete with and displace U.S. firms in these market niches around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Whereas it would have likely taken China, by itself, decades to replace the equipment that the United States is no longer willing to sell, assistance from the Netherlands or Japan could have had China back up and running in as little as a year or two.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the policy disaster that the United States had to avoid at all costs: cutting off a key revenue source for U.S. companies, creating stronger international competitors to U.S. tech leadership, and having almost nothing to show for it in terms of affecting China’s military technology trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is not the only thing that the United States wanted from the Netherlands and Japan in negotiations. Dutch and Japanese companies dominate additional categories of semiconductor manufacturing equipment that U.S. companies do not. In particular, they dominate the production of lithography equipment, the most advanced types of which rival the James Webb Space Telescope or Large Hadron Collider in terms of technological precision and complexity. In January 2021, the think tank Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) published a report on the global semiconductor value chain that argued:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Netherlands, Japan, and a small number of other countries are the dominant producers of lithography equipment, critical for the production of chips and photomasks. China cannot produce any advanced lithography equipment. Most importantly, the Netherlands and Japan are exclusive providers of advanced photolithography equipment — especially extreme ultraviolet (EUV) scanners and secondarily argon fluoride (ArF) immersion scanners — necessary for mass-production of advanced chips, representing China’s top chokepoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the United States maintains control of strong chokepoints for blocking China’s access to the future of AI and semiconductor technology, but the Dutch and Japanese chokepoints are even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined, these facts suggest two primary goals that the United States sought in its deal with the Netherlands and Japan: (1) an agreement to prohibit Dutch and Japanese companies from backfilling the categories of semiconductor manufacturing equipment that the United States is no longer selling to China, and (2) an agreement to prohibit the Dutch and Japanese from exporting their advanced lithography equipment to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dutch companies are the world leaders in lithography steppers and scanners, which produce and refract the light that passes through a photomask (a transparent plate that contains the desired circuit pattern) to transfer that pattern to the silicon wafer. Japanese companies are the other major producers of steppers and scanners. In 2019, the two countries combined enjoyed more than 99 percent worldwide market share. Japan is also dominant in resist processing tools and electron beam lithography tools, which are critical for producing photomasks. Beyond lithography, there are other categories of semiconductor manufacturing equipment where Dutch and Japanese companies are also dominant — Japan in silicon wafer crystal machining equipment, for example — and Japan also excels in the production of the ultra-precise materials and ultra-pure chemicals that are used for semiconductor manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least some of these other semiconductor technology categories were likely included in the deal. However, lithography equipment — including steppers and scanners, electron-beam tools, and resist processing tools — is the most important foreign technology dependence in the Chinese semiconductor industry, and sources with knowledge of the deal have confirmed to CSIS that restricting exports of advanced lithography equipment to China was included in the deal. As was an agreement to prevent backfilling of U.S. equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But knowing that these are the categories of items to control does not answer how they will be controlled. For that, a closer look is needed at how the October 7 policy is designed and what that suggests about the desired U.S. approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-revealed-policy-preferences-of-the-biden-administration-in-the-october-7-regulations&quot;&gt;The Revealed Policy Preferences of the Biden Administration in the October 7 Regulations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The publication of the October 7 regulations included a supplementary information section that detailed the rationale and justification for the regulations. In general, however, these justifications are geared toward explaining how the government’s actions are consistent with the legal authorities that it possesses. In particular, the justifications go into great detail to explain the connection between exports of semiconductor technology to China and China’s nuclear weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and advanced missile programs. This is important because many export controls authorities for both the United States and other countries apply only in cases of counter-WMD efforts, which the paper will return to again later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the October 7 document deserves further discussion beyond the explicit justification. The U.S. government’s actions themselves are an important clue to what the United States desires and how it assesses the likely interplay of certain policy mechanisms and market forces. The U.S. approach reveals a great deal about what U.S. policymakers want and, therefore, presumably what they would have asked for from the Dutch and Japanese governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of semiconductor equipment manufacturing, the Biden administration used multiple tools from its export controls policy toolbox. It also created other policy tools, such as new types of FDP rules, by drawing upon legal authorities and flexibilities granted to the U.S. Department of Commerce by the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 and earlier legislation. A previous CSIS paper, “Choking Off China’s Access to the Future of AI” goes into significantly greater detail on the various elements of the policy. This paper will focus only on the elements related to chip wafer fabrication and semiconductor manufacturing equipment since these are the two that matter most in the context of the U.S. agreement with the Netherlands and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the October 7 regulations are designed to restrict China’s ability to manufacture semiconductors above certain technology performance thresholds, which in the semiconductor industry are commonly referred to as a “technology node.” These performance thresholds are segmented by the three major categories of chips, all aligned at the same technology node. They are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;logic chips: FinFET or superior, which corresponds to 16 nanometers (nm) or lower technology nodes;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;short-term memory (DRAM): 18 nm or lower; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;long-term memory (NAND): 128 layers or higher.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The October 7 regulations created a new Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) on the Commerce Control List, ECCN 3B090, which details 11 different types of semiconductor manufacturing equipment that are exclusively relevant to producing chips at this technology node or better. This paper refers to these categories of equipment as “advanced node equipment.” Then, there is a much longer list of equipment that is potentially useful for producing chips equal to or better than the previously mentioned performance thresholds but that are also often used to produce older chips. This paper refers to these categories of equipment as “node-agnostic equipment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The October 7 regulations require an export license for selling advanced node equipment to any end-users in China, but the policy also states that license applications will be reviewed differently depending on the location of the end-user company headquarters (e.g., China).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Commerce will review license applications for U.S. exports of advanced node equipment to companies that are headquartered in China (Chinese companies) with a “presumption of denial,” which is de facto a ban. However, license applications for sales of advanced equipment to company facilities that are operating in China but are owned by non-Chinese companies headquartered in a country on the Commerce Export Administration Regulations (EAR) A:5 or A:6 list will be reviewed on a “case-by-case basis,” depending upon “factors including technology level, customers and compliance plans.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, Chinese-owned companies are prohibited from buying advanced equipment, but companies headquartered in more trusted countries (the A:5 and A:6 lists) will likely still be able to buy advanced equipment for their production facilities in China. Shortly after October 7, the U.S. Department of Commerce granted one-year authorizations to Taiwanese and South Korean companies to allow them to continue purchasing U.S. advanced node and node-agnostic equipment for their advanced semiconductor manufacturing facilities in China. During a speech at CSIS on February 23, Undersecretary of Commerce Alan Estevez stated that “We’re working with those companies on the way forward there. So, what it’ll likely be is a cap on the levels that they can grow to in China . . . If you’re at whatever layer of NAND we’ll stop it somewhere at that range. It will depend on what the Chinese are doing too, but we are in deep dialogue with the companies around that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exports of node-agnostic semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China are restricted only under end-use control. Even after October 7, there is no export license requirement for node-agnostic equipment sales to facilities in China unless that facility is producing chips equal to or better than the previously mentioned performance thresholds, which is the relevant end-use. In such cases, all equipment sales, whether advanced node or node-agnostic, are subject to a presumption of denial. For example, SMIC, the most advanced Chinese logic chip manufacturer, has some facilities that, in 2022, achieved mass production of 14 nm logic chips. SMIC also has many other facilities that produce at older technology nodes, such as 28 nm and 55 nm. The SMIC 14 nm facilities face a presumption of denial on purchases of both advanced node equipment and node-agnostic equipment. SMIC’s 28 nm facilities will be allowed to purchase the node-agnostic equipment, as well as legacy node equipment, but not the advanced equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same export restrictions that apply to the sale of equipment also apply to the provision of equipment components as well as expertise and advice. If the United States does not want China to be able to buy advanced semiconductor equipment, it only makes sense that they would also not want China to be able to buy all the constituent components that could be assembled into such equipment. Nor would they want to allow U.S. consulting companies and experts to teach China how to build such equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated above, the approach that the United States has taken reveals a great deal about what U.S. policymakers want and what they think is required to succeed. The U.S. policy is designed to halt Chinese-owned production of advanced chips but also to provide more flexibility in decisions related to foreign-owned production of advanced chips in China. The United States also wants to continue allowing China to produce less advanced chips but only to Chinese companies that clearly give up on the goal of producing advanced chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a safe assumption, therefore, that the United States asked the Netherlands and Japan to adopt rules that pursue the same goals but also reflect the different technological niches that each country occupies in the semiconductor value chain. This leads naturally to the question of what types of lithography equipment are sufficiently advanced to allow for producing chips at the performance levels covered by the October 7 thresholds. The five different types of lithography technology relevant to the question, in order of most advanced to least advanced, are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;extreme ultraviolet (EUV);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;argon fluoride immersion (ArF immersion) deep ultraviolet (DUV);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;argon fluoride dry (ArF dry) DUV;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;krypton fluoride (KrF) DUV; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I-line.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dutch government already stopped granting EUV scanner export licenses to China in 2019, so expanding the deal to include Japan and other types of EUV lithography equipment besides scanners was the easiest area on which to reach agreement in the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I-line lithography, which was already in widespread use by the mid-1980s, is positively ancient by semiconductor industry standards and is, therefore, unlikely to be included in the deal. Again, the U.S. controls seek to (1) restrict sales of advanced node semiconductor manufacturing equipment to all Chinese-owned semiconductor production facilities in China and to (2) restrict sales of both advanced node and node-agnostic manufacturing equipment to Chinese semiconductor production facilities that intend to produce advanced chips (those above the aforementioned performance thresholds). I-line lithography equipment is neither advanced nor useful for producing advanced chips, and thus it is irrelevant to both U.S. goals. There is little reason to restrict its export to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves the three types of DUV lithography — ArF immersion, ArF dry, and KrF — as the possible places to draw the line. In commercial usage, KrF dates back to the late 1980s, ArF dry dates to the late 1990s, and ArF immersion dates to the mid-2000s. However, new and improved versions of all three types of DUV lithography machines continue to attract commercial customers due to their lower costs and reduced operational complexity. They are especially attractive to fab operators in China, where massive government subsidies allow Chinese companies to focus more on growing market share in legacy chip production than achieving unsubsidized commercial profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most advanced Chinese lithography company, Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment group (SMEE), currently markets systems using ArF dry and KrF technology. This is important because the risk of foreign substitution is a key criterion for export controls decisions. However, SMEE’s most advanced ArF dry lithography machines are in the prototype stage and have not yet achieved the affordability, reliability, and performance required to be marketed commercially. On every metric that matters, they are dramatically inferior to Dutch and Japanese alternatives. Moreover, SMEE DUV scanners are more than a decade and a half behind the state of the art in the Netherlands and Japan in terms of the types of chips that they can produce. Of note, in December 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce added SMEE to the Entity List “for acquiring and attempting to acquire U.S.-origin items in support of China’s military modernization.” This action is consistent with the overall approach of the October 7 regulations and was likely a helpful step for securing Dutch and Japanese buy-in. SMEE will struggle more than it already has with reduced access to foreign lithography technology components — such as light sources, mirrors, and laser amplifiers — and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its 2021 final report, the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) included a recommendation that directly pertains to both the logic behind the October 7 policy and the resulting negotiations with the Netherlands and Japan. It is worth quoting at length:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[The United States Government should] work with the governments of the Netherlands and Japan to align the export licensing processes of all three countries regarding high-end SME [semiconductor manufacturing equipment], particularly EUV and ArF Immersion lithography equipment, toward a policy of presumptive denial of licenses for exports of such equipment to China. This would slow China’s efforts to domestically produce 7nm or 5nm chips at scale and constrain China’s semiconductor production capability of chips at any node at or below 16nm — which the Commission assesses to be most useful for advanced AI applications — by limiting the capability of Chinese firms to repair or replace existing equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The October 7 policy targeted the 16 nm technology node (FinFET), and the NSCAI concluded that the right lithography technologies to apply export controls to prevent China from producing 16 nm or better chips were EUV and ArF immersion. EUV and ArF immersion are also the lithography technologies that the aforementioned CSET report identified in 2021 as “China’s top chokepoint.” Combined, this strongly suggests that the agreement between the United States, the Netherlands, and Japan drew the performance threshold line to restrict sales of EUV and ArF immersion lithography equipment, related components, and possibly expertise to China. An examination of Dutch export controls law provides even further evidence for this conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-legal-authorities-underlying-the-dutch-export-control-system&quot;&gt;The Legal Authorities underlying the Dutch Export Control System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned previously, the U.S. Congress had already passed multiple laws updating the process for making export controls and giving additional legal flexibilities and authorities to the executive branch to issue new export controls regulations. Naturally, a deal with the Netherlands and Japan would be much more difficult to achieve if it required their governments to pass new laws to implement the agreement. While ASML, the leading Dutch lithography company, has stated that it believes that the Dutch parliament will have to pass new laws to implement the agreement, the Dutch and Japanese governments have not indicated that new laws are required. Thus, a careful examination of the existing legal authorities available for export controls, in particular for the Netherlands, provides significant relevant information for inferring the content of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Combined, this strongly suggests that the agreement between the United States, the Netherlands, and Japan drew the performance threshold line to restrict sales of EUV and ArF immersion lithography equipment, related components, and possibly expertise to China.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview with CSIS, Sebastiaan Bennink of BenninkAmar Advocaten, a Dutch law firm that specializes in economic sanctions, export controls, and trade law, explained that there are three potential sources of legal authority for the Dutch government to regulate the export of dual-use goods and services (i.e., commercial items with both civilian and military applications):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the Wassenaar Arrangement;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;European Union dual-use export controls regulations; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dutch legislation passed by parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Wassenaar Arrangement:&lt;/strong&gt; Created after the end of the Cold War, the Wassenaar Arrangement is the most important multilateral export controls framework. It establishes the process for updating the List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies and Munitions. Each of the member states agrees to apply an export controls licensing process to all of the listed technologies and also to exchange information regarding the export of such items. The United States, Japan, and the Netherlands are all participating states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critically, the Wassenaar Arrangement’s founding documents state that “The decision to transfer or deny transfer of any item will be the sole responsibility of each Participating State.” As a party to the Wassenaar Arrangement, the Netherlands already has a system of export licenses in place for all items on the List, and the Dutch government has both the responsibility and the authority to make decisions about whether license applications will be reviewed with a “presumption of denial.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithography scanner and stepper equipment are included on the Wassenaar list when the equipment has “a. A light source wavelength shorter than 193 nm; or b. Capable of producing a pattern with a ‘Minimum Resolvable Feature size’ (MRF) of 45 nm or less.” Both ArF dry and ArF immersion use a 193-nm light source (i.e., equal to but not shorter than 193 nm), so that criterion would only allow restrictions of EUV lithography tools. The MRF criterion achieves the same result. Dylan Patel of SemiAnalysis has argued that ArF immersion, ArF dry, and even some types of KrF lithography machines are capable of producing patterns with an MRF size of less than 45 nm, but only by using multiple patterning techniques. This might be true in theory, but in practice, it would be extremely difficult to exclusively use legacy equipment to produce advanced chips with competitive quantity, quality, and price to be commercially relevant. Regardless, the equation that the Wassenaar list requires governments to use when calculating MRF does not take into account the effects of multiple patterning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Dutch government’s authority under the Wassenaar Arrangement gives it the flexibility only to restrict the exports of EUV lithography equipment, which it was already controlling prior to the October 7 rules. Updating Wassenaar rules requires consensus among all member countries. Russia, a Wassenaar member that has been extensively targeted with technology export controls following its invasion of Ukraine, has made clear that it will veto any proposed reforms to the existing Wassenaar list. The recent deal between the Netherlands and the United States must, therefore, have gone beyond Wassenaar and beyond EUV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;European Union Dual-Use Export Controls Regulations:&lt;/strong&gt; The Netherlands has aligned its laws and regulations on export controls with those of the European Union. However, the European Union not only requires an export license but can also specify that certain types of exports are prohibited. In practice, such EU export controls regulations must be imposed by the European Council and can only be instantiated with the unanimous consent of all EU member countries, which is difficult to achieve. The EU response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was one of the rare instances in which new export controls were imposed on a unanimous basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the lists of EU export-controlled goods and services conform to those of the Wassenaar Arrangement, and this is indeed the case for lithography equipment. However, Article 4 of the European Union’s export controls regulations (EC No 2021/821) grants individual member states the independent authority to require a license for items other than those on the EU lists in certain cases. One of those is cases in which:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[. . .] the items in question are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for use in connection with the development, production, handling, operation, maintenance, storage, detection, identification or dissemination of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or the development, production, maintenance or storage of missiles capable of delivering such weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The October 7 regulation justifications included significant analysis of the connection between exports of advanced computer chips and other semiconductor technologies and the military supercomputers that China uses to develop nuclear weapons and advanced nuclear missile delivery systems, such as hypersonics. This is undoubtedly true and does not require the capabilities of the U.S. intelligence community to prove; journalists at the Wall Street Journal independently reviewed Chinese government procurement documents and reached the same conclusion. Moreover, when the U.S. government builds advanced supercomputers, it freely acknowledges that simulating nuclear explosions and hypersonics modeling are among their most important tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the United States was not misleading or exaggerating when it said that the technologies being export controlled were directly related to China’s supercomputers as part of China’s nuclear weapons and missile programs. Loudly and repeatedly emphasizing this point, however, served an additional purpose: reminding the Dutch government that they were within their rights to invoke Article 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Article 4 criteria apply, it means the Dutch prime minister and the Dutch cabinet (specifically the ministers of foreign affairs and foreign trade) can implement new export controls license requirements and a policy of “presumption of denial” for certain types of goods without requesting a vote by either the European Council or the Dutch parliament. Given the relatively thin majority of the current ruling Dutch political coalition, this is a significant convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that the Dutch will not ultimately seek to Europeanize the controls. Mathieu Duchâtel of the Institut Montaigne has argued persuasively that the Dutch should and will do so, both to reduce the risk of Chinese retaliation and to build cohesion between the European members of the Dutch semiconductor equipment supply chain. Regarding the latter point, there is some cause for optimism. Partly as a result of the tremendous U.S. response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and U.S. efforts to align technology policy with the European Union, Dutch and wider European confidence in the United States is growing alongside increased wariness of China. In a February 2023 op-ed, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte wrote, “I cannot see how this will be China’s century. The 21st century will be the century of democracy and thus the century of America.” Similarly, during a recent speech at CSIS, EU commissioner Thierry Breton gave a speech in which he said: “We cannot allow China to access the most advanced technologies, be they in semiconductors, quantum, cloud, edge, AI, connectivity, and so on. I see a very strong alignment on this agenda between the EU and the U.S., even if we may sometimes differ on the methods, which is normal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some German think tank scholars, including Tobias Hehrke and Julian Ringhof of the European Council on Foreign Relations, have argued that the European Union must update its strategic approach to export controls in the wake of the October 7 policy. Even Germany’s government, which has historically been cautious about strengthening restrictions on technology trade with China, recently blocked the acquisition of a Chinese takeover of a German semiconductor fab. Future geopolitical developments could accelerate the U.S., EU, and Japanese semiconductor export controls alignment. In mid-February, U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken warned that China was considering providing “lethal support” to Russia’s military. Given the speed and strength of the European Union’s export controls reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, such a move by China would no doubt cause a dramatic reassessment of the European relationship with China, including on technology export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desire to ultimately bring Europe into the new semiconductor export controls framework is a reason in favor of drawing the line at ArF immersion lithography technology, rather than ArF dry or KrF. Given that the vast majority of Chinese domestic semiconductor production facilities are producing chips at older technology process nodes, restricting ArF immersion is primarily about choking off China’s access to future technological progress in AI and semiconductors, redirecting Chinese semiconductor production capacity growth toward older technology nodes, and redirecting advanced production capacity growth to countries outside of China. In that regard, the United States, Japan, Europe, South Korea, and Taiwan have all signaled a desire to significantly increase government support of semiconductor production investments. If the policy and diplomatic stars align, this could even mean that U.S. and allied semiconductor equipment producers need not face an overall reduction in sales from the October 7 regulations and their foreign equivalents — merely a geographic customer realignment. This favorable outcome would require more than a few strokes of luck, but the possibility exists. Regardless, there is a strong reason for the major allied powers in semiconductors to align their investment strategies to avoid duplication and unprofitable overcapacity in key segments. Aligning export controls is basically a pre-requisite to aligning investments, and that increases the chance that the major semiconductor powers will do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary-and-conclusion&quot;&gt;Summary and Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, the U.S. deal with Japan and the Netherlands included assurances that Japan and the Netherlands will not allow their semiconductor manufacturing equipment companies to sell to China the categories of equipment that the United States is now prohibiting. The agreement also included assurances that the Dutch and Japanese governments will prohibit the sale of lithography equipment — steppers and scanners, electron-beam tools, and resist processing tools — most likely at advanced performance levels consistent with EUV and argon fluoride immersion technology. The agreement also likely covered the export of related technology components that are used in the production of such lithography equipment and may have even restricted consulting services for transferring knowledge related to such machines, though this is more speculative. Finally, the agreement may have also prohibited the sale of a much broader set of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, as well as materials and chemicals, in cases where these represent genuine market chokepoints. In all cases, such restrictions in the Netherlands and Japan will likely follow the U.S. approach of treating export license applications differently depending on whether the chip production facilities in China are Chinese-owned or foreign-owned, as well as the degree of technological advancement at the production facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though many details remain unclear at this stage and will likely require continued diplomatic engagement to iron out, the semiconductor export controls agreement between the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands is a major diplomatic achievement for all three countries. Furthermore, if the countries can implement and enforce an agreement, that achievement alone would advance the formation of a new plurilateral export controls regime on semiconductors. This, in turn, begs questions about the long-term suitability of the Wassenaar Arrangement for housing these types of sensitive dual-use diplomatic agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Even though many details remain unclear at this stage and will likely require continued diplomatic engagement to iron out, the semiconductor export controls agreement between the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands is a major diplomatic achievement for all three countries.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work is not done, however. Germany is a leader in the production of key components that make up semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and South Korea is both a leader in chip manufacturing and a small but sophisticated producer of manufacturing equipment. Both Germany and South Korea need to join the new export controls agreement in order to prevent the fracturing of the U.S.-led global semiconductor value chain. If possible, it would be best if the entire European Union were to join. None of this will be easy or quick, but the trilateral deal has bought years of time and demonstrated to others that the United States will work to protect the interests of those that join it in promoting international peace and security.&lt;/p&gt;

These span the levels of conflict and range from strategic miscalculation and a centralised command structure inherently unable to adapt and react to poorly conceived and executed operational plans to tactical errors.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;All have contributed to the prolongation of what Vladimir Putin had seemingly planned as a short ‘special military operation’ into the first mass mobilisation of the Russian population since World War II and continued escalation. From the Western perspective there have been lessons to draw from the conflict and the Ukrainian armed forces’ robust defence of their sovereign soil.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tenacity of Ukraine’s troops has been buoyed by an influx of modern weaponry from NATO and the West since the Russian invasion began in February 2022. But preceding these important imports was a coherent package of support to the Ukrainian defence and security sector from the UK and its allies, which began in 2014 and – at the time of writing – appears to represent a successful case of upstream capacity building and investment that contrasts sharply with the chaotic collapse of Western support in Afghanistan. Does such an approach provide a model for future defence engagement activity or is there a danger of drawing premature conclusions from an ongoing war? And do we risk being too selfcongratulatory by linking our support with the successes of those unified in their fight for the survival of Ukraine as a nation state?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the first question to consider though is why the British Army should occupy itself with such endeavours? The answer to which should be relatively fresh in Western military minds – capacity building aims to avoid the messy outcomes often associated with peacekeeping and stabilisation operations. As Nilsson and Zetterlund write: “Fragile countries are to be strengthened so that they can shoulder their own problems, thereby reducing the need for international assistance”. The paradigm of capacity building is not without issue. It is poorly defined and can range from a short, simple training course in a specific skill through to a multi-departmental effort orchestrated over months or years with significant resource. It can span a broad spectrum of activities – from short-term training teams through to institutional reform. The selection of the capacity to be built is important. Indeed, “building the ‘wrong’ capacity or strengthening the ‘wrong’ actors might make a conflict even worse”. Capacity building is similar to security force assistance, although is generally considered to have a wider remit where force footprints are small and often focused on basic tactical training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;post-crimea-commitment&quot;&gt;POST-CRIMEA COMMITMENT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion of the UK’s commitment to the development of Ukraine’s defence and security sector began in earnest after the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014. There were two significant strands to this: Operation Orbital – the provision of training and support to the Ukrainian armed forces (primarily in the land domain) and assistance, afforded to the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine and wider government, in implementing security sector reforms. In summary, the blend of tactical training and equipping the Ukrainian armed forces was paired with the longerterm institutional changes required at the operational and strategic levels. These efforts complemented both the NATO-led assistance to the country as an enhanced NATO partner nation and unilateral engagement. Ukraine has been part of the US National Guard State Partnership programme since 1993. This offers, among other training opportunities, low level non-commissioned officer leadership training. The surge of the UK efforts since 2014 came during a period of increased focus on what the Chief of the General Staff at the time outlined as defence engagement, one pillar of which was the development of regional capacity to enable security concerns to be dealt with by their respective regional governments. This built on concepts first articulated in the Strategic Defence and Security Review in 2010, which viewed Defence playing a key role in early, upstream capacity building to preventthe causes of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“Operation Orbital deployed in 2015 with a focus on training, mentoring and advising local military personnel and with the intent to improve the capacity and capability of the Ukrainian armed forces on a sustainable basis.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a similar model to previous training missions (including in Afghanistan), Operation Orbital deployed in 2015 with a focus on training, mentoring and advising local military personnel and with the intent to improve the capacity and capability of the Ukrainian armed forces on a sustainable basis. By February of last year, more than 22,000 Ukrainian troops had received British training. A subsequent focus on planning, operations and low-level leadership assisted in the development of a cadre of well trained, tactically astute officers and soldiers capable of planning coherent military activity at the tactical level supported by and set within an operational framework. This was in tandem with NATO and other unilateral support to Ukraine, with multi-national training teams regular visitors to the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/k9Cl3Aa.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concurrently, pre-dating the recommendations of the Integrated Review, Operation Orbital was enhanced by UK support to theUkrainian Ministry of Defence and other government departments to drive security sector reform and improve areas such as procurement that had previously been open to corruption. The increased workload in Ukraine was supported by a reinforced defence section, employed within the embassy in Kyiv, further improving and exploiting efforts from the Ministry of Defence, Foreign, Commonwealth &amp;amp; Development Office and partners across government. This encapsulated the all-encompassing, whole of government approach to national security later detailed in the 2021 Integrated Review. It is partly this exploitation of existing synergies of the work completed by partners across government that have made the capacity building in Ukraine a comparative success and potentially a useful model for further upstream projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-lessons-can-we-learn&quot;&gt;WHAT LESSONS CAN WE LEARN?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The models currently in use for engagement activity (such as the Methods of Effect model) place the emphasis on what activity we will undertake in a given country and how we measure its effectiveness. There is less attention paid to the underlying suitability of a country or understanding if the model used is the correct one for the circumstances prevalent in that country. The war in Ukraine has been one of national survival with the majority of society united in its determination to expel the Russian invaders, a unifying factor that has undoubtedly played a significant part in the defence of their homeland. The fight has been in many ways a conventional, metal-on-metal battle rather than a counter-insurgency conflict (as some commentators considered it would develop into). The government and military have acted in tandem with a united and obvious intent, and Ukraine has welcomed efforts to develop its capacity and supported them internally. In previous upstream capacity building efforts this has not always been the case, with the Clausewitzian trinity of the political, the military and the public bodies divided and disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“The government and military have acted in tandem with a united and obvious intent, and Ukraine has welcomed efforts to develop its capacity and supported them internally. In previous upstream capacity building efforts this has not always been the case.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logistics have also been relatively straightforward. For the UK and many other European nations, it has been comparatively simple to move massed materiel across the Continent – although this supply chain is now being severely tested as the battle continues. The unity of the Ukrainian response and the country’s relative proximity should not, however, detract from what has been a coherent, layered and connected example of defence overseas engagement working to develop capacity and capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WHZDbg6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if the aim of upstream capacity building is delivering sustainable peace and stability, then it could be argued that the evolution of the Crimea crisis into a wider, conventional war suggests that international endeavours in Ukraine have been in vain. To do so would be harsh, given the Kremlin’s true intent towards Ukraine has gained significant clarity since 2014 and the limited options open to dissuade Putin from his current course, and should not deter the UK from continued investment in capacity building across the globe. Equally, the fruits of the multi-layered capacity building labour are clear. The enduring presence from 2014 to prior to the Russian invasion of last year has assisted in Ukraine’s defence. The basic measure of effectiveness with a desired end state of a capable and resilient Ukrainian Armed Forces and security sector has been achieved. It is Russia’s ongoing struggle against this capable, determined resistance that will have a deterrent effect. This effect demonstrates part of the utility of capacity building and other activities that fall under the defence engagement concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZAhdrlP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“The vision is to enable the Ukrainians to export parts of the programme and deliver them domestically. This is a key point for capacity building. It should not be entirely transactional from the donor to the partner nations.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict also raises questions about the effectiveness of the UK’s and NATO’s deterrence posture. Russia was not deterred by economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure or the limited presence in Ukraine of UK, NATO and Western allies in a training capacity. Indeed, the presence of Western force elements could have played into Moscow’s narrative of NATO encroachment and confrontation with Russia. This narrative has been amplified during the conflict with the Kremlin pushing its perception of a battle between Russia and the West both internally and increasingly across the global south. Although the deterrence measures taken prior to the conflict failed on several fronts this should not lead to an abandonment of the concept. What does deter aggression is a capable opposing force able to inflict damage and sustain a defence. In Ukraine, this form of capable deterrence has been further enhanced by the rapid influx of advanced, Western weaponry that has been used to inflict punishment on the attacker. A lesson and deterrent, perhaps, for future aggressors. In a hark back to the proxy wars of the Cold Warera, Ukraine is now awash with a spectrum of capabilities from Western allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s cross-governmental approach and close liaison with international partners such as NATO has partly realised the vision of the Integrated Review for a coherent approach to upstream capacity building to promote stability. It is this, working alongside a united, legitimate political body with popular support, that provides a potential template for future capacity building efforts and highlights the benefits of UK investment after the debacle of withdrawal from Afghanistan. Our continued training engagement through Operation Interflex – the successor to Operation Orbital outlined below – assists in what must be a capability interoperability and integration-atspeed issue for the Ukrainian armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;op-interflex&quot;&gt;OP INTERFLEX&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British forces left Ukraine only days before the Russian invasion. The following months saw partner nations begin to send equipment to Ukraine and devise other packages of support along several lines of effort. In June 2022, whilst on a visit to Kyiv, then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a major programme to train Ukrainian soldiers. This announcement developed into Operation Interflex – an endeavour that has seen Ukrainian troops trained by the British Army and partners in the United Kingdom, with a stated aim of training 10,000 soldiers every 120 days. The threeweek package covers basic infantry skills such as marksmanship, medical training and cybersecurity and partner nations such as Australia and New Zealand, as well as representatives from members of the Joint Expeditionary Forces, including Estonia and Denmark, have lent expertise to the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An event hosted by the Royal United Services Institute and attended by representatives from Land Operations Command and 5th Battalion, The Rifles in November provided a number of insights on Interflex. After the initial rotations, the course was increased from three to five weeks as a result of the feedback loop received from units returning to Ukraine. The syllabus would be familiar to anyone who has undergone initial military training, although it is possible to see the influence of the specific conflict being prepared for. The course includes teaching on the law of armed conflict, trench warfare, marksmanship, section defence and urban training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the five-week basic combat course, a second five-week junior leadership course aimed at junior non-commissioned officers and sergeants has been taking place. This concentration added command and leadership training as well as the military decision-making process. Soldiers are given instruction on how to coach marksmanship, complete commanders’ checks, are drilled in simulated mounted tactics and receive counterunmanned aircraft systems training. The vision is to enable the Ukrainians to export parts of the programme and deliver them domestically. This is a key point for capacity building. It should not be entirely transactional from the donor to the partner nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring the effect of such efforts can be difficult. Indeed, Western forces have been involved in other capacity building enterprises which have not been successful. Both Iraq and Afghanistan offer examples of vast investment in time and resource where the trained forces have not stood up to scrutiny. Both forces quickly capitulated in the face of Islamic State and the Taliban respectively, leaving Western forces embarrassed. Recent analysis has looked to determine the reasons for this issue. As Robinson argues, the gap between the imported army concepts and recipient culture was vast. The leading power brokers in both states did not want to create the liberal moderate state of Western peace builders’ imagination, and therefore the military transformation was out of step with that of the civilian sector. Ukraine, on the other hand, is more closely aligned with European sensibilities, both geographically and culturally. Indeed, anecdotal evidence from soldiers who have returned to the front after receiving British training is positive. In one example, a subsection of a Ukrainian unit that repulsed a Russian assault was asked by their commander about the source of their tactical knowledge. “This is what we were taught to do in UK training,” came the response. Another front-line Ukrainian commander whose unit took part in the Battle of Kherson stated that “we are delighted with the high level of preparedness of soldiers we are receiving from the United Kingdom who have been trained by Op Interflex”. Of course, it is unlikely that the Ukrainians would publicly admit that the training was not having the desired effect so some of the praise may also have some value in encouraging partners to keep up support. However, capacity building has its limits. There was never a chance that Orbital would put Ukraine on a peer level with Russia and as such, NATO support has been, and – without a finish line in sight – will continue to be necessary going forward. This speaks to the importance of drawing a clear end point to efforts, rather than becoming stuck as permanent trainers to a population for extended periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-best-practice&quot;&gt;OTHER BEST PRACTICE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict in Ukraine has offered other examples of successful capacity building which might provide a model to build upon. Professional military education is one such area, and one that often does not receive the same level of coverage as combat training. The Defence Education Enhancement Programme is a joint US-NATO endeavour to professionalise the officer and noncommissioned officer corps of partner nations, and first came into being in 2007. It aims to establish “effective, self-sustaining defence institutions” and the Ukrainian chapter became the largest in the world in 2013. These efforts to “help the Ukrainian military transform from a rigid centralised Russianstyle operational decision-making process to one where junior and mid-level leaders are expected to take initiative on the battlefield” have been credited with enabling Ukraine’s forces to operate with an agility and dynamism absent from their adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ryWnqBn.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainment is another area which has received attention during the conflict. US European Command and the Institute for Security Governance, part of the US Defence Security Cooperation University, began a programme in 2016 to help Ukraine establish effective sustainment planning protocols. US support to Ukraine was such that it overwhelmed the Ukrainian ability to incorporate repair and sustainment into its own organic capability. As a result, the US had to cover this burden, which in turn sapped resource from providing new equipment and support. Among the success stories is the pilot effort to improve domestic sustainment of the high mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicle (or Humvee as it is more commonly nown). Initiatives included servicing centres, developing maintenance manuals and creating a mobile repair unit. Since the invasion in 2022, this issue has become exacerbated with a plethora of weaponry and equipment flooding into Ukraine. Indeed, byone analysis, the Ukrainian armed forces are operating 14 different artillery systems, “each with distinct maintenance and ammunition requirements, creating a tangle of logistics challenges”. This reinforces the importance of having institutions which have the capacity to absorb such increases in burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/REm1hE2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two examples are useful to stress the importance of institutional capacity building over simply running training courses. Attempting the former is rife with vulnerabilities and each scenario will require a bespoke approach which takes heed of culture, history, and the complexities of organisational change programmes. It is also important to consider civilian elements of capacity building, as it is not purely a military sport. The Polish Medical Mission – a non-governmental organisation – provided bespoke deliveries of medical equipment to 50 hospitals from June to December 2022. Crucially, the logistic chains required to support deliveries to hard-to-reach areas in a conflict zone are now developed and remain established so they can be used going forward. Israel, which has received some criticism for not supporting Ukraine with military equipment, provides another example. A civilian-run field hospital was deployed to Ukraine for six weeks in the spring of 2022. The facility provided battlefield care but also prioritised wider local capacity building, delivering training in a variety of techniques to circa 800 Ukrainian medical personnel. The capacity to treat wounded people and return them to the fight is vital and is an area of expertise in which the British Army is highly skilled and experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upstream capacity building offers a means by which the British Army can contribute to peace and security, advance the vision of Global Britain and make use of its deep and well-developed experience throughout the defence lines of development – from doctrine development, sustainment and combat training to professional education and medical knowledge. The ongoing example of Ukraine shows the utility of long-term commitment to a force to provide vital capacity with which to counter aggression. It has also shown how resource intensive successful capacity building can be, and there is no end in sight to the support currently being given. This may become unpalatable to decision makers as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example of Ukraine also provides a useful distinction from the seemingly failed attempts to build armies in Iraq and Afghanistan. Rebuilding military forces and attempting to forge a functioning state with imported idealshas been proven to be a losing mission. Conversely, Ukraine’s cultural similarities and relative stability appear to have afforded the atmosphere necessary for successful capacity building. It is difficult to conclusively prove the correlation/causation link between capacity building activities and the effectiveness of a country’s armed forces but there is clear evidence of an enhancement of Ukraine’s military prowess. Whether attributable in part to multinational efforts or not, there is plenty of progress to be seen when you compare the events of 2014, when a much smaller Russian force was able to achieve its objectives largely unchallenged, to today’s well-orchestrated defence and counter-offensive operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5WGgLZH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（1日）踏入審訊第17天。其中李予信因打泰拳，疑腦震盪留院，法官認為不能在被告缺席下繼續審訊，終決定押後，案件或於明午或周五早上再續。此外，代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 表示控方昨天新呈800頁文件，包括3份有關證物鏈的證人供詞，其中一份為負責獲取新界西影片的證人陳鑫（音譯）。控方擬就其中一人申請匿名令，惟官着控方待李予信出庭再處理。法官陳仲衡一度提醒獲准保釋的被告，不要參與任何危險的運動，法官陳慶偉指「試想想這裡一天需要多少法律開支」，法官李運騰亦補充，不僅是律師，外面也有警察駐守，「我們說的是每天數百萬元」，相關做法似乎並不負責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;撤口罩令首天-大部分被告無戴口罩&quot;&gt;撤口罩令首天 大部分被告無戴口罩&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今天是政府撤銷口罩令第一天，還柙的被告在開庭前陸續被帶往被告欄，除了梁國雄外，其餘還柙被告均沒有戴口罩，而看管他們的懲教人員卻有戴口罩。在延伸庭的8名列席認罪被告馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，亦全沒有戴口罩，開庭前互相談笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於獲保釋的劉偉聰、楊雪盈、鄭達鴻、彭卓棋和陳志全庭上沒有戴口罩，黃碧雲、何啟明、施德來、柯耀林則有戴口罩。3名主審法官及大部份律師均沒有戴口罩。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李予信因泰拳受傷留院-官稱不能在被告缺席下繼續審訊&quot;&gt;李予信因泰拳受傷留院 官稱不能在被告缺席下繼續審訊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，代表李予信的大律師關文渭指，李在上周日（26日）玩泰拳期間受傷，疑受腦震盪，他如期出席周一（27日）的聆訊，但其間感到非常不適，亦有嘔吐，最終在昨日（28日）送往屯門醫院急症室治療，醫生囑他留院觀察，但李望法庭繼續審訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰一度形容，李予信在保釋期間參與「本來就危險」的運動，關文渭回應「所有運動都可以是危險」，法官陳慶偉則舉例不包括桌球和扔飛鏢，關文渭重申僅是意外。陳慶偉問及有否醫療證明，關引述醫院指要出院才能簽發，亦不肯定李現時情況或何時能上庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰認為，在沒有醫療證明下，不能單憑辯方的說法確定李予信情況，亦認為不能在被告缺席下繼續審訊。控方代表、副刑事檢控專員萬德豪表示會採取行動去確認辯方的資料是否正確，又指今日原訂在庭上讀出控辯雙方承認事實，而李予信早已同意了相關事實，理解辯方獲指示在李缺席的情況下繼續審訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰重申，不認為在被告缺席下繼續審訊是合適做法，認為應押後。關文渭指，會嘗試要求主診醫生簽發醫療證明，並理解李予信已轉至觀察病房。法官陳慶偉決定，今天不會繼續聆訊，並着各方今午通知法庭李予信的狀況，以決定明午是否如常開庭，並暫定星期五早上續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍大狀稱昨收3份新證人供詞-控方欲為其中一人申匿名令&quot;&gt;何桂藍大狀稱昨收3份新證人供詞 控方欲為其中一人申匿名令&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 其後指，昨天收到控方800頁新文件，包括已核證的英文譯本，以及5項新材料，其中有3份新的證人供詞，均與證物鏈相關，包括負責獲取新界西相關影片的證人陳鑫（音譯）、TVB助理新聞製作總經理葉炳棠和另一負責搜證的警員。Beel 指，3人供詞均於案件開審後，分別於2月21日、23日及13日才錄取，表示幾乎從未聽聞這樣的情況，又強調該些供詞應一早準備好（“All these statements should be taken long time before.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，他亦尚未有機會閱讀該些供詞，並表示他與 Beel 有同樣不滿（“I share your dissatisfaction.”），亦認為有關證物鏈的證據，理應在很早以前便處理好（“… should be obtained long long time ago.”），但認為 Beel 現時仍有時間考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

However, Europe has a dilemma: it is spending more on defense but cooperating less — all despite three decades of political initiatives designed to improve European defense cooperation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this brief explains, there is no single reason for this failure: it is a result of a deep-seated collective action problem entrenched across the political, economic, and military fields of the European defense landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief identifies three main insights for NATO, EU, and European policymakers to help solve Europe’s defense dilemma:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding the challenge as a collective action problem reveals three principles that can help unlock European defense cooperation: small groups, normalization, and mechanisms to incentivize cooperation (and discourage fragmentation).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previous experience reveals internal and external factors that influence the prospects for cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many different types of defense cooperation may be used to provide European leaders with a range of options to boost cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-sorry-state-of-european-defense-cooperation&quot;&gt;The Sorry State of European Defense Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;european-defence-agency-eda-november-15-2022&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;European Defence Agency (EDA), November 15, 2022&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“In terms of defence spending, the positive trend seems to be accelerating, in line with announcements from the majority of pMS [participating member states]. It remains to be seen whether pMS will follow a coordinated approach which would ensure greater efficiency and interoperability of armed forces, and avoid further fragmentation.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine has led to a transformational moment for European defense. Together, European nations have committed to nothing less than a pan-continent Zeitenwende, providing unprecedented military assistance to Ukraine, drastically hiking defense spending, and reversing long-standing defense policies. But the real test for European leaders is yet to come: Can they deliver lasting change in Europe’s ability to defend itself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important element of transforming European defense — and the focus of this paper — is the level of multinational cooperation in Europe. Increasing European defense cooperation promises political, economic, and military benefits for the nations involved. As EU high representative Josep Borrell explains: “We could avoid competing for the same products, competing for the same things with a limited industrial capability. We may have greater bargaining power; we could ensure the interoperability of the armies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the benefits of European defense cooperation have proven elusive. Cooperation remains the exception, not the rule. The excerpt above from the European Union’s latest annual report on European defense spending captures the current European defense dilemma: Europe is spending more on defense but cooperating less. Or, as one headline bluntly summarized, “Record EU defence spending masks failure to collaborate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to EU data, both the total amount of cooperative spending and the number of cooperative initiatives have decreased significantly over the last decade. As of 2020, cooperative equipment spending fell to 11 percent of total defense spending, far short of the European Union’s target of 35 percent and the lowest figure since EDA records began in 2005. The same trend applies to cooperative research and development (R&amp;amp;D) spending, which was 6 percent of overall R&amp;amp;D investment in 2020, far below the EDA’s 20 percent target and another record low. Figure 1 shows these trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7Dak07S.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Defense Investment and Collaborative Spending in European Defense.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EDA summarizes the situation in plain language: “Despite the increase in total defence expenditure, defence investments and defence equipment procurement, spending for collaborative projects does not seem to be a priority for the majority of MS [member states].”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European defense cooperation is in a sorry state. Worse still, it is not for want of trying: several transformational efforts have failed to improve European defense cooperation since the end of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial transformation of European defense forces after 1989 — through NATO and, from 1993, the European Union — fell short in Bosnia and Kosovo, where Europe relied heavily on the U.S. military. This led to further transformation efforts over the next decade, both through NATO and based on a new, dedicated European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP). Several flagship NATO and EU initiatives focused on developing capabilities through cooperation and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, operations over Libya in 2011 again revealed European shortfalls and continued reliance on the United States for strategic capabilities. Combined with the fallout from the 2008 global financial crisis, this led to another transformation attempt through two flagship cooperation initiatives: EU Pooling and Sharing, established at a 2010 EU Council meeting on defense, and NATO’s Smart Defence, launched at the 2012 Chicago summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Russia seized Crimea in 2014, European nations realized they needed to refocus on collective defense, committing to drastically increase spending at NATO’s 2014 Wales summit. This imperative — combined with the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union — provided an opportunity to roll out several new initiatives to transform EU defense cooperation, including the European Defence Fund (EDF) and Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of three decades of political impetus and flagship initiatives on European defense cooperation is difficult to judge. While there have been several successful examples of defense cooperation — for example, in strategic lift and air-to-air refueling, a critical Libya shortfall — and long lists of NATO and EU projects, there are too many examples where European cooperation did not emerge where it could have, such as in the naval sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the EDA’s figures tell the story: cooperation within the European Union has markedly declined over the last decade, and the prospects are not good. This dilemma could not come at a worse time for Europe. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine requires stepping up defense on several counts: to continue supporting Ukraine, to bolster its own defenses to deter Russia from wider aggression, and to make up for the inevitable reduction in U.S. forward presence as American forces are required to deter an increasingly capable and belligerent China in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet while European defense spending has skyrocketed, most of it has gone toward urgent, off-the-shelf U.S. equipment, from ammunition to air defense. Continuing with this policy will not address the fragmented and piecemeal nature of Europe’s defense industrial base and defense forces. As one analyst puts it, Europe is “missing its moment” to embed cooperation and fix its fragmentation problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, Europe has a dilemma: it is spending more on defense but cooperating less. The track record of European defense cooperation invites two questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why is European defense cooperation so difficult?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can it be made easier?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report addresses these questions in two parts. It first shows that challenges to European defense cooperation are rooted in a deep-seated collective action problem with political, economic, and military dimensions. It then uses insights from collective action theory to identify several principles for solving Europe’s defense cooperation problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-collective-action-problem-in-european-defense-cooperation&quot;&gt;The Collective Action Problem in European Defense Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;tomas-valasek-2011&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Tomas Valasek, 2011&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“There is a great contrast between the co-operative way in which European countries fight wars, and the insular manner in which most prepare for them. . . . Yet in peacetime EU militaries revert to their national ways. . . . This is a very wasteful way to build armed forces.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic challenge to European defense cooperation is known in economic and political theory as the collective action problem. This problem arises in groups where actors would be better off cooperating but are discouraged from doing so by individual incentives that work against joint action. The tragedy of the collective action problem is that all parties are worse off than they would have been had they been able to overcome the barriers to cooperation. These challenges to European defense cooperation have three dimensions: political, economic, and military (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-challenges&quot;&gt;Political Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political factors are often judged the most important for success in defense cooperation. There are three basic political challenges to European defense cooperation: the strategic cacophony problem, the strategic fit problem, and the specialization dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Strategic Cacophony Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant challenge to defense cooperation is posed by sovereign imperatives that work against cooperation. In the European context, Hugo Meijer and Stephen G. Brooks have referred to this as the “strategic cacophony” problem, which they define as “profound, continent-wide divergences across all the domains of national defense policies, most notably threat perceptions.” Their analysis suggests this problem is so deeply embedded that overcoming it “would require a long-term, sustained and coordinated effort.” The practical results are described in the EDA’s 2022 CARD report: “Member States implement their [defense] plans to a large extent nationally. . . . Key drivers remain primarily nationally defined requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For EU member states, political factors are a double-edged sword as they work in both directions: cacophony and integration. The political imperative to make the EU project succeed provides a powerful incentive to cooperate with fellow travelers. At the same time, national sovereignty works in the opposite direction and may prevent a natural ceiling to ever closer cooperation, though both effects vary in potency between member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A different dynamic is present in NATO, which has focused more pragmatically on coordination and interoperability over the years rather than on cooperation and integration as an end in itself. By one assessment, NATO is “the only institutional framework that has fostered some degree of coordination in Europe (at the strategic, doctrinal, and capability levels) and partly contained Europe’s strategic cacophony.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Strategic Fit Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political factors that influence multinational defense cooperation include shared goals, strategic culture, geography, and history. These boil down to the same problem: strategic fit. As one study on defense cooperation puts this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In a [business] environment, a lack of “strategic fit” may lead to the reluctance of one company to procure demand objects with its competitors. . . . In the context of [cooperative] purchasing in defence, the requirement for a “fit” is more complex.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors may include political and ethical issues about the use of force in certain situations or trust and reliance on other nations. Furthermore, “as trust and ethical alignment is not static, this results in a dynamic development of cooperation in defence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, this makes defense cooperation politically demanding and doubly difficult: not only must the stars align for two or more nations to decide that defense cooperation is viable to begin with, but they must work to maintain their strategic fit in the face of resistance and changing circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Specialization Dilemma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specialization — focusing on one product or domain to enhance efficiency — is the bedrock of economic theory and practice. Yet this principle is less prevalent in defense and security, which as a public good is less amenable to market principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic cacophony problem also limits the extent to which nations can give up capabilities (or rely on others to specialize for them), which creates the specialization dilemma: national capitals know specialization would bring benefits, but they cannot follow through. Worse still, nations often end up limiting or removing some aspect of their forces by default rather than design due to national political or industrial issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-challenges&quot;&gt;Economic Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All things being equal, defense cooperation should give European nations more bang for their euro. However, two main challenges have prevented the economic benefits of cooperation from being realized in practice: the fragmented nature of European defense and a defense spending bias toward short-term gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fragmentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the problem is fragmentation. When it comes to European defense, all things are not equal. The European defense landscape and market are heterogenous and economically inefficient due to strategic cacophony, which fragments demand and supply by favoring national defense forces and defense industries. Where cooperation emerges, fragmentation also contributes to inefficient work share, duplication of facilities, and multinational management structures that add friction and cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of fragmentation is incoherence and capability gaps. Europe’s military forces are not designed to fit together neatly like a jigsaw puzzle. A 2017 assessment showed EU militaries have 178 different types of weapon systems — 148 more than the United States, despite having half the budget. Several assessments have also revealed Europe’s high-end capability gaps in deterrence and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts to date have seen little progress or promise to overcome fragmentation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No improved coherence of the EU defence landscape has yet been observed. . . . It remains to be seen whether pMS will follow a coordinated approach which would ensure greater efficiency and interoperability of armed forces, and avoid further fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-Termism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, according to EDA figures, spending has gone up while cooperation has gone down. This indicates European nations favor spending on national or off-the-shelf equipment from non-EU countries over cooperation — especially equipment made in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this approach has short-term merit in addressing the immediate threat cost efficiently, it also exacerbates the fragmentation problem. As the EDA summarizes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is overall a strong prioritisation of off-the-shelf equipment procurement in most MS which could be further reinforced by the current security context. If off-the-shelf procurements are conducted in an uncoordinated manner, this could negatively impact the coherence of the EU defence landscape and curtail European cooperation in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-challenges&quot;&gt;Military Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges of defense cooperation in the military and defense acquisition context are threefold: defense planning, joint procurement, and multinational operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense Planning Alignment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One implication of the strategic cacophony problem is that national military requirements and defense procurement cycles are rarely aligned, which makes cooperative solutions even more difficult. The sheer variety in the size, scale, and capabilities of national defense forces across Europe compounds the already invidious problem of multinational defense planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense planning alignment is the key to unlocking the deepest forms of cooperation. The most significant multinational capability development projects — from the A400M transporter to the Eurofighter Typhoon — have occurred when several nations have prioritized the same requirements at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joint Procurement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing complexity of modern defense capabilities makes procurement in the national context highly challenging. However, CSIS’s Greg Sanders and Andrew Hunter note, “While single-nation acquisition programs are hard, international joint acquisition is harder.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three main challenges to joint procurement. The first is the added complexity of managing international actors, which requires multinational organizations and structures that introduce cost and friction. The second is divergent national preferences regarding requirements, work share, and incentives for joint procurements, which are difficult to align. The third is the specificity dilemma. This arises because it is easier for nations to cooperate on low-specificity items that many of them could use (such as clothing, medical supplies, or small arms) rather than bespoke, high-specificity objects and systems (such as missiles, ships, and aircraft). Yet the gains from cooperation on high-specificity items far outweigh those in the low-specificity realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multinational Operations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern military operations are also becoming increasingly complex and challenging as they integrate new technologies and doctrine, such as multidomain operations. These challenges are multiplied in the context of multinational operations for two main reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is command and control (C2) of multinational operations, which incur setup and running costs that can be prohibitive, as shown by the European Union’s experience with battle groups and operational headquarters. In practice, multinational units also suffer from frictions related to language, strategic culture, sovereignty, and interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second challenge to multinational military operations is the growing complexity of modern warfare. The natural conservatism of military organizations poses a serious challenge for European military cooperation in particular, given the disparities in technology and capability among them and with key allies (e.g., the United States).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overcoming-the-challenges-to-european-defense-cooperation&quot;&gt;Overcoming the Challenges to European Defense Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;letter-signed-by-10-european-defense-experts-november-7-2022&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Letter signed by 10 European defense experts, November 7, 2022&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“If Europeans really . . . want to become a credible player in the international security arena, they must do and spend more together. And they must do it now.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous section showed that the challenges to European defense cooperation are rooted in a deep-seated collective action problem with political, economic, and military dimensions. This section considers how to overcome those challenges and solve — or at least improve — Europe’s defense cooperation problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It proceeds in three parts. First, it identifies three principles for overcoming the cooperation challenges above. These principles are based on the theory of resolving collective action problems. Second, it identifies key factors for improving the prospects of cooperation. These factors are drawn from the literature on multinational cooperation. Third, it identifies several different types of cooperation — all of which can be used to expand the options for European defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-principles&quot;&gt;Key Principles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-1-use-the-power-of-small-groups&quot;&gt;Principle 1: Use the power of small groups&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the power of small groups may be the best way to enhance European defense cooperation and mitigate the political challenges in European defense. Collective action problems are less prevalent in small groups where free riders cannot hide, members are more inclined to trust each other, identification and enforcement are easier, and group identity or solidarity may be stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The promise of small groups in European defense is not new, with several examples in NATO and the European Union (e.g., the Framework Nations Concept and PESCO). Several studies in recent years have highlighted the untapped potential of “country clusters,” “islands of cooperation,” “core groups,” and “differentiated cooperation” in European defense. Moreover, bilateral relationships and small groups are already widespread, as “the essence of defense cooperation in Europe is a web of hundreds of bilateral and minilateral collaborations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the full power and potential of small groups to transform European defense cooperation has not been realized. Existing small groups either emerge ad hoc or are not designed with defense cooperation in mind. Instead, small groups should become an organizing principle of European defense, taking advantage of the subregional dynamics that already exist across Europe. Small groups also have the potential to specialize and exploit division-of-labor benefits within them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To go further, previous studies have identified areas where new or existing small groups could address capability gaps or adopt a regional focus. As small groups can form across a range of cooperation types (see figure 3), existing groups such as the European Air Transport Command (EATC) or the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) could also build on the strategic fit they have established to expand cooperation into other areas (e.g., codevelopment or procurement).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-2-normalize-cooperation&quot;&gt;Principle 2: Normalize cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to overcome collective action problems is to normalize desired behavior among groups. Developing group norms, social solidarity, group identity, and reciprocity also encourages cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treating cooperation as the default setting, rather than the exception, would mitigate many of the political, economic, and military obstacles to cooperation by aligning incentives and introducing a common strategic culture of cooperation. Cooperation can be normalized in European defense in three main ways: political prioritization, championing success, and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Cooperation a Political Priority&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, European capitals and institutions should take every chance to make cooperation a political priority. The EU Versailles declaration in March and the raft of initiatives that followed are a good example, linking the need to embed cooperation in European defense with the continent’s response to war in Europe. As EDA chief executive Jiří Šedivý stated, “At EU level we must now work to shift the balance and make cooperation the norm.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even with the winds of crisis in their sails, there is still a danger that “the EU’s new defense bureaucracy’s proposals remain just that.” Brussels and EU capitals must maintain a laser-like focus on enhanced cooperation as the means to address the worsening security environment — and an end in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the EU Strategic Compass and Versailles declaration, neither the June Madrid summit declaration nor the new NATO Strategic Concept mentions the need to enhance cooperation among members. This also stands in contrast to NATO’s first strategic concept in 1949, in which cooperation between allies was a central theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the July Vilnius summit on the horizon — and a historic seventy-fifth anniversary summit in Washington in 2024 — NATO has an opportunity to make cooperation its center of gravity once again by making it a clear political priority. One model for this is the 2014 Wales summit, at which allies agreed to the Defence Investment Pledge to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense by 2024. A new cooperation pledge may provide the same political impetus and accountability that contributed to increased spending levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO allies should put as much emphasis on the need for European defense cooperation as they have on European defense spending. This shift could be significant for the United States given its diplomatic clout and its traditional wariness of European defense industrial cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Champion Success, Name and Shame Failure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another strategy for normalizing cooperation in European defense is championing success stories while naming and shaming failure. With 18 projects and new members joining regularly, this approach to NATO’s High Visibility Projects (HVPs) has seen some success. However, there is a difference between new projects and those that have delivered results: the latter should be the focus of any high-visibility campaigns. The success stories of European defense cooperation are not widely known, and in some cases the data do not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publicly reporting on defense spending data can also change norms by encouraging good behavior and calling out bad. This makes nations more accountable to each other and their citizens. Both NATO and the European Union already do so annually, but their approach is limited in three ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the EDA’s figures are anonymized in its annual defense data report, which undermines their utility to both champion success and name and shame failure. Considering the attributed data can be accessed elsewhere on the EDA’s website and that NATO already attributes much of the same data annually, this anachronism should be corrected to unlock the benefits of sharing performance data and enhance transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, both the European Union and NATO should report accurately on cooperative spending. EU figures are misleading because only half of the member states report their data. NATO should adopt the same practice as the EDA and report on cooperative spending while maintaining attribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, both NATO and the European Union should be more creative when reporting on levels of cooperation: spending data are far from the only measure and may be misleading. Other indicators would complement spending data and give a fuller picture, such as national cooperation policies, cooperative treaties, participation in multinational formations, equipment standardization levels, and NATO standardization agreement compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage Cooperation through Leadership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leadership is important in overcoming collective action problems. All groups have leaders who are willing to bear the costs for reasons of status, history, strategic culture, and so on. Leaders can encourage cooperation in two main ways: through demonstrative leadership or by removing the burdens of cooperation for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demonstrative leadership requires nations to assume group leadership roles or lead by example. Exemplar behavior could be expanded or replicated. Examples of nations that have prioritized and implemented cooperation include the Franco-German brigade, German-Netherlands tank battalion, Belgian-Netherlands naval cooperation, Benelux joint air policing, UK-France Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF), and UK “international by design” policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the European Union’s PESCO projects, NATO’s 18 HVPs do not have appointed leaders, only participants. NATO should appoint lead nations to realize the collective action benefits of leaders. Leadership effects can also be exploited within international institutions. For example, NATO and the European Union could appoint senior officials charged with increasing cooperation levels, while a European Centre of Excellence for cooperation could share best practices among nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leadership can also remove the burden of cooperation from others to encourage cooperation or mitigate perceived risks, such as Baltic air policing or support to Ukraine. Provision of security assurances can also encourage nations to cooperate, while larger nations can help cover short-term gaps for smaller nations while cooperative solutions come to fruition. This form of leadership also helps solve the specialization dilemma and could unlock the division of labor potential in European defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-3-incentivize-cooperation-or-discourage-fragmentation&quot;&gt;Principle 3: Incentivize cooperation (or discourage fragmentation)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third principle for overcoming the cooperation problem in European defense is to incentivize good behavior using carrots or deter bad behavior using sticks. These can be implemented by a central authority or by social mechanisms such as rules and norms. Carrots and sticks should be designed for two purposes: to consolidate either the fragmented supply or demand of European defense cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consolidate Demand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josep Borrell explains the need to consolidate demand: “We need a reliable production capacity. But a reliable production capacity in the field of defence requires also a reliable demand.” The main way to consolidate fragmented demand is through collective approaches to setting strategy and military requirements, such as through NATO and the European Union. However, current cooperation levels suggest the existing approaches to demand consolidation are not meeting their potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These could be improved in two ways: setting multinational targets and using small groups to catalyze cooperation. First, defense planning capability targets are currently set on a default national basis by NATO and the European Union. This misses the opportunity to bake in consolidated demand from the outset and should be reversed: capability targets should be multinational by default and national by exception. For NATO, these changes could be instigated at the forthcoming Vilnius summit in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, small groups may present an untapped resource for consolidating demand on a geographical or functional basis (see above). To take advantage of this potential, small groups should be made a focal point for cooperation, both within NATO and the European Union and through their own forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other avenues for demand consolidation include finding ways to incentivize the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the long-term benefits of defense cooperation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;national specialization in specific capabilities or industrial expertise&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pooling and sharing to realize economies of scale&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;improvements in interoperability and standardization&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consolidate Supply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three main ways to consolidate supply on the European defense market. The simplest is to reduce the institutional friction involved in cooperation to make multinational solutions more viable through dedicated structures for joint procurement or multinational formations. The most demanding way to consolidate supply is to create a single market for defense equipment — an approach that is unlikely to become politically viable any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third way to consolidate the fragmented supply in European defense is to design structural incentives and regulation to reduce market inefficiency. Both the European Union and NATO have unique tools to generate such incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a political and economic union with financial and regulatory levers at its disposal, the European Union is uniquely positioned to incentivize cooperative supply in Europe. Given the “limited or even non-existent impact” of previous regulation intended to discourage national sourcing, the European Union in recent years has turned to economic incentives, including the EDF and other new and prospective initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, given the state of European defense cooperation, the only question is whether these new incentives will be enough to overcome the powerful political incentives that work against cooperation. Several expert assessments suggest not. A cursory look at the numbers supports their case. But how much is enough? According to think tank experts Max Bergmann and Benjamin Haddad, as much as €100 billion in EU borrowing is needed to overcome the severe obstacles to cooperation. This figure is around the same level as that already provided in emergency assistance for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO has two types of economic incentives to encourage cooperation among allies: joint funding and common funding. Joint funding enables groups of allies to set up frameworks or agencies that NATO has political oversight over and runs on their behalf. A recent example designed to incentivize R&amp;amp;D cooperation is the Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA), which is complemented by a €1 billion innovation fund. As with the European Union’s incentive schemes, the amount of funding is modest. Now that the model is established, NATO leaders should increase innovation funding at the Vilnius summit. The DIANA model could also be applied elsewhere, such as by incentivizing participation in HVPs, through a joint cooperation fund. The fund could also be designed with a bias toward initiatives that address European gaps with European solutions and could become a focal point for NATO-EU cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second economic tool NATO has for incentivizing cooperation is common funding, through which allies pool resources to provide alliance-wide goods. Several in-service and capability development projects already prove the effectiveness of common funding to enable and encourage cooperation. However, there is only one commonly funded HVP: the Multinational Multirole Tanker Transport project. This commonly funded, “cooperative by design” approach should become the default option for addressing common capability gaps identified by the NATO defense planning process. This would require a much larger common funding budget and extensive negotiation given the disparate views on the matter. Nevertheless, it could be put on the table at Vilnius. In the meantime, allies could review which HVPs are candidates for common funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;success-factors&quot;&gt;Success Factors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous section applied principles for solving collective action problems to help overcome the challenges of European defense cooperation. This section surveys lessons from the literature on past examples of cooperation to identify key factors for success. It is worth noting the issue of what makes European defense cooperation initiatives more or less likely to succeed has not been widely studied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These success factors may be divided into two types: endogenous (internally caused) and exogenous (externally caused). Both are summarized in Figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/V0YJSbl.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Endogenous and exogenous factors in European defense cooperation.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;endogenous-factors&quot;&gt;Endogenous Factors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following endogenous factors are divided into four core factors and three enabling factors. The core factors for successful defense cooperation are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust and solidarity.&lt;/strong&gt; Trust and solidarity are “the basis for success” but must be developed over time. The sovereignty barrier to cooperation is not insurmountable but does not give way easily. Practical measures can help generate both, such as the delegation of authority arrangements in the EATC, the legal basis of the UK-France CJEF, and the JEF’s common policy directive and opt-in model. Building trust and confidence is easier with fewer nations participating, though the number of participants is related to the type of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared strategic culture and like-mindedness.&lt;/strong&gt; Strategic culture, geography, and linguistic and cultural proximity have also been shown to play a part in emerging clusters of cooperation — for example, within PESCO. Like-mindedness (shared conceptions, policies, and priorities) has played a role in several initiatives, including the JEF. However, this factor is “important, not crucial” because nations who do not share strategic cultures can still cooperate effectively together. In fact, cooperative initiatives — particularly joint military formations — often develop a shared mindset, or esprit de corps, of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear goals and serious intent.&lt;/strong&gt; According to one study, “All case studies confirm the importance of this factor.” A CSIS study shows that successful projects can satisfy a range of goals, whether political, operational, or economic — as long as they are agreed to early on. If it is true “governments that take defence seriously . . . will be more inclined to co-operate than others,” those nations most committed to investing in their defense will be the best candidates for cooperative projects — and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Military-strategic symmetry.&lt;/strong&gt; Having forces of similar size and quality is important for cooperation but is “not a golden rule.” This factor is related to establishing trust, being like-minded, and agreeing on shared goals. One important aspect of symmetry is defense planning alignment, which goes hand in hand with the deepest forms of cooperation. Regardless of symmetry, standardization and interoperability act as “multipliers for cooperation” through aligning concepts, doctrine, and equipment standards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following factors indirectly enable cooperation rather than secure success:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A level playing field for defense industry.&lt;/strong&gt; Defense industry protectionism undermines the prospects for cooperation because it reduces the chances of joint procurements or cross-border collaboration and erodes trust. Another challenge is the mixed role of the U.S. industry in European defense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of institutions.&lt;/strong&gt; International institutions and regimes — whether formal (e.g., NATO or the European Union) or informal (e.g., minilateral groups) — are designed to overcome many of the barriers to cooperation. Institutions also enable the collective action benefits of large groups, such as increased resources or coalitions of the willing. However, bottom-up cooperative initiatives can be just as viable as top-down initiatives driven by institutions — both are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost savings.&lt;/strong&gt; Economic factors are often critical to the political argument for justifying cooperation in the first place. This argument is generally one of cost savings and efficiency. For example, the European Sky Shield air defense initiative purports to offer “a flexible and scalable way for nations to strengthen their deterrence and defence in an efficient and cost-effective way.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exogenous-factors&quot;&gt;Exogenous Factors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Endogenous factors are an important limitation and enabler for the prospects of European defense cooperation. However, external factors often trump internal ones. History shows the power of exogenous forces and shocks in shaping the environment and the policies that result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This point is made in the context of European defense in a RAND report on European strategic autonomy, which concludes that “EU-led initiatives in pursuit of European strategic autonomy in defence are important, but its shape will also be determined by external influences.” This effect can be seen in European defense spending levels, which rose significantly after Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea and in the context of an isolationist president in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example exogenous factors that may influence the prospects for European defense cooperation over the next decade include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the global economic outlook&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the war in Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;levels of regional and global aggression and conflict&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the policies of revisionist actors, such as Russia and China&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the policy of key allies such as the United States (toward Europe and regarding European defense in particular), the United Kingdom, and Turkey (regarding EU defense)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the credibility and policies of NATO&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;unknown future shocks and surprises&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;types-of-defense-cooperation&quot;&gt;Types of Defense Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many different types of defense cooperation. This final section outlines a typology for understanding the landscape of defense cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wide variety of cooperation types gives European defense leaders a range of options to boost cooperation. Knowing this fact may help overcome the challenges of European defense cooperation as leaders may tailor initiatives to the specific situation and constraints of the participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typology is based on four characteristics of cooperation, shown in Figure 4:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Form refers to the structure of cooperation, from loose association to tight integration. Forms depend on the degree of participant interdependence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Function:&lt;/strong&gt; Function refers to the purpose of cooperation, from establishing joint military units to the joint procurement of capability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venue:&lt;/strong&gt; Cooperation occurs through formal multilateral institutions (such as NATO and the European Union), small groups (minilateral), or bilateral relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; Cooperation has political, economic, and military benefits. The benefits of defense cooperation depend on its nature and may provide various benefits. For example, multinational military units may provide more military or political than economic benefit, while joint procurements may yield more economic benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-now-or-never&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Now or Never&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe has a defense dilemma: it is spending more on defense but cooperating less. This is despite three decades of flagship political initiatives designed to improve European defense cooperation. There is no single reason for this failure. It is a result of a deep-seated collective action problem entrenched throughout the political, economic, and military dimensions of the European defense landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, there is no silver bullet. Even the radical change in the threat environment since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may be counterproductive if new defense spending is not directed toward European cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the solution is simple: European capitals must prioritize cooperation over other objectives, though this is easier said than done. However, understanding the nature of the problem can inform the solutions in three ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, conceptualizing European defense cooperation challenge as a collective action problem reveals three principles that European leaders and institutions can apply to overcome the challenges:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use the power of small groups&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take steps to normalize cooperation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design mechanisms to incentivize cooperation and discourage fragmentation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, previous experience reveals internal and external factors that influence the prospects for cooperation.&lt;/strong&gt; Endogenous factors include trust, like-mindedness, clear goals, and symmetry, alongside other enabling factors. Exogenous factors include external threats, the policies of key allies, and the unexpected shocks that so often shape international politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, there are many different types of defense cooperation.&lt;/strong&gt; Knowing this may help overcome the challenges of European defense cooperation, as initiatives can be tailored to the specific situation and constraints of the participants to provide European leaders with a range of options to boost cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe has solved collective action problems before. The success of the European Union in embedding cooperation across a wide swath of European life, from its origins in the coal and steel community to recent advances in digital services laws, demonstrates the power of shared identity to overcome the constraints of national polices and borders. The same goes for NATO, an organization founded on the power of cooperation for the common good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe can solve its defense cooperation dilemma, but it needs to think big and act fast. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has provided a wake-up call for European leaders and the imperative they need to transform European defense. They cannot miss their moment: it is now or never.&lt;/p&gt;

The paper also tests common assertions around the effects of Brexit, reductions in the UK aid budget, and the merger of two government departments, the Department for International Development (DFID) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, successive British governments have sought to emphasise that a post-Brexit UK would be outward-looking, collaborative and influential. A series of speeches and policy statements have emphasised the pursuit of prosperity and an intention to capitalise on previous investments in overseas aid, trade, defence and diplomacy. In March 2021, the UK government published its Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy. The document reiterated these themes and referenced East Africa for increased UK engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, a RUSI research team has set out to examine how the UK has deployed its development, defence and diplomacy toolkit in four countries in East Africa in support of this agenda. The project, entitled ‘Furthering Global Britain? Reviewing the Foreign Policy Effect of UK Engagement in East Africa’, asks what factors have helped or hindered the UK in pursuing a ‘Global Britain’ agenda in Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan. The research also tests some common assertions around the effects of Brexit, reductions in the UK aid budget, and the merger of two government departments, the Department for International Development (DFID) and the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO) into the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper sets out the research findings on the UK’s relevant engagements in Ethiopia, focusing on 2015 to the present. It finds that the UK has made some limited progress on aspects of its foreign policy agenda in the country. Examples can be found of UK action contributing towards positive outcomes, including through forging partnerships; combining defence, diplomacy and development aid; and pursuing trade and prosperity agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis suggests, however, that the UK has indeed been constrained by a number of internal factors: smaller and unpredictable budgets; the unplanned merger of the FCO and DFID; the absence of a detailed strategy for Ethiopia; and weaknesses with leadership. And while the UK is still regarded as a capable and relevant actor, with skilled personnel and a measure of influence in certain areas, the overall picture is one of diminished status. Aid cuts are a factor. Losing the DFID brand has also been a net negative. Leaving the EU has not presented insurmountable practical difficulties, but it is seen by many as diminishing UK influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overriding limiting factor for UK action in Ethiopia in recent years has, however, been a worsening operating context since a change in Ethiopia’s leadership in 2018. Initial hopes for reform and greater openness have been dashed by a series of political decisions, and the devastating war in Tigray. A severe drought across the Horn of Africa has accentuated these difficulties. Widespread insecurity, hunger and violence have resulted. Decades of socioeconomic progress, achieved in part through close partnership with the UK, have been reversed. These events have upended Ethiopia’s relationship with the outside world, and the country’s trajectory is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite tensions and challenges, the UK has successfully maintained relationships with a range of actors through its work in Ethiopia. It has also adapted to events and made positive contributions, even with reduced resources. The UK’s future strategy and approach should reflect lessons learned on the nature of the Ethiopian state, the sources and limitations of influence, and the UK’s particular contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the June 2016 Brexit vote, successive UK prime ministers Theresa May and Boris Johnson repeatedly made reference to ‘Global Britain’. The phrase attracted widespread commentary, much of it quizzical or critical. It was, however, an attempt to signal – albeit in boosterish language – a sense that the UK would remain an outward-looking country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2021, the UK government published a policy paper, Global Britain in a Competitive Age: The Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy, commonly known as ‘The Integrated Review’. The document recognised a more competitive global context than in earlier years but reiterated the now familiar ‘Global Britain’ themes. It signalled a wish for the UK to play a proactive role in global affairs, work in partnership with others, and better integrate foreign policy, defence, trade and international development efforts. Africa was referenced in terms of forging partnerships and pursuing shared goals such as prosperity, democracy and security. The policy paper also referenced overseas aid, while leaning strongly towards promoting trade, economic resilience and the alignment of international development with wider foreign policy. Eastern Africa was highlighted as a region for increased UK engagement. Specific references were made to Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan, and in the case of Ethiopia to working in partnership ‘to further our shared prosperity goals, our democratic values and our security interests’ and to investing in ‘regional stability, moving towards closer defence cooperation with … Ethiopia if the situation there allows’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, a RUSI research team has set out to examine how the UK has deployed its development, defence and diplomacy toolkit in Eastern Africa in support of its Global Britain agenda, looking at how it has sought to bring about positive change in the countries in which it is working while also securing secondary, largely geopolitical, benefits in the national interest at a time of domestic and international change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a two-year research project, the team has sought to test some of the assertions that have been made around Brexit; the reduction in the UK aid budget from 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI) to 0.5%; the increases in the defence budget; and the creation of the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp;amp; Development Office (FCDO) from the merger of the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Department for International Development (DFID) announced in June 2020. The project, entitled ‘Furthering Global Britain? Reviewing the Foreign Policy Effect of UK Engagement in East Africa’, asks whether these structural changes have helped or hindered the progress of recent UK governments’ Global Britain policy agendas in the region, while seeking to identify factors that may have contributed to or limited the UK’s ability to project influence. It aims to answer the following research questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How effective has the UK been in making a positive difference in relation to Global Britain objectives in the region in recent years, particularly via development aid, diplomacy and defence engagement?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What impact have recent structural and policy changes such as Brexit, aid cuts and the creation of the FCDO had on Global Britain outcomes?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does the UK’s approach and impact differ from those of others?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do UK aid priorities for Eastern Africa align with those of the region’s governments, and what are those governments’ expectations of and recommendations for the UK?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research methodology consisted of a review of selected policy literature and semi-structured interviews. Interviews were used to identify factors that recurrently enabled or constrained UK actions, particularly with reference to positive outcomes to which the UK was thought to have contributed. Data on UK aid, defence and diplomatic engagement in the four focal countries covering the period 2015–2022 is used as a reference point to identify UK policy objectives and trends over time. The intention is to provide an overview of the realities of UK engagement in each country over a six-year period and to identify the factors that were most salient in driving outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper offers the project’s findings on the UK’s engagement in Ethiopia. It is based on a review of key secondary sources and 58 interviews with government officials, staff from multilateral organisations, and predominantly Ethiopian interviewees from academia, civil society, media and business (see Annex).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter I provides background on Ethiopia–UK relations and summarises the UK’s major policy interests and its main investments in international development, diplomatic and defence engagement in the country in recent years. From within this broad portfolio of work, Chapter II highlights several examples of UK action that have contributed to positive outcomes in Ethiopia. Chapter III identifies key factors that have constrained or enabled UK action in this period. The paper concludes with commentary and analysis of these factors in relation to the project’s research questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper should be read in conjunction with upcoming companion papers on the UK in Kenya, Sudan and Somalia, and an earlier publication that sets out the project methodology in depth and offers more detail on UK investments in the region. A synthesis paper that combines findings from the four focus countries will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethiopia is the most populous country in Eastern Africa, with approximately 120 million citizens alongside significant numbers of refugees. Diplomatic relations with the UK were formally established in 1841. In 1868, a 13,000-strong British force invaded what was then Abyssinia to free British nationals who had been held hostage by Emperor Tewodros II as a tactic to secure military aid from Queen Victoria. From 1935 to 1936 Ethiopia fought and lost the second Italo–Ethiopian war. Its reformist emperor Haile Selassie went into exile in the UK. A British imperial force invaded again in 1940, ousting the Italian army and restoring the emperor to power in 1942. He remained in power for the next 32 years, eventually being overthrown by a military junta (the Derg) in 1974 following a bitter civil war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 1991 to 2018 Ethiopia was governed via a system of ‘ethnofederalism’. This gave autonomy to major nationalities within a polity dominated by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the leading actor within the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), the coalition that had ousted the previous regime in 1991.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overseeing a poor and diverse population, deferring democratisation, and committed to a state-led economy, the EPRDF sought legitimacy via economic growth. Under one-time president and later prime minister Meles Zenawi, the country achieved enviable rates of growth. In the mid-2000s it became the fastest-growing economy worldwide, registering an annual growth rate of over 10% between 2004 and 2009, and it acted as a cheerleader for international development in global forums. Approximately one-third of the country’s national budget of $9 billion came via foreign, mostly Western, aid. Seeing Ethiopia as a quintessential ‘developmental state’, the UK became a staunch partner to the EPRDF. The UK–Ethiopia relationship was built initially in the 1990s, on UK prime minister Tony Blair’s rapport with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. Via the now-defunct DFID, the UK aligned strongly with the EPRDF’s development agenda, providing direct budget support and funding initiatives linked to government service delivery. Ethiopia at times became the largest single recipient of UK bilateral aid globally, much of it channelled via the government in support of service delivery. This left the UK open to criticism when the Ethiopian government fell short on human rights. Western donors at times tried but largely failed to use ‘conditionalities’ to push democratisation and human rights agendas. The brief move by Western donors to pause and then restart budget support in response to state brutality linked to national elections in 2005 is one example of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, the EPRDF came to play a notable role in the formation of the African Union (AU), the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, negotiations on international development and climate change, and more. Ethiopia made a substantial investment in peacekeeping. From the 2000s onwards, Ethiopian troops were major contributors to the AU in Somalia (AMISOM), the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), the UN Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA), and the UN–AU Mission in Darfur (UNAMID). The Ethiopian National Defence Forces (ENDF) received training and income, while the Ethiopian government shaped politics and security in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meles continued Ethiopia’s long tradition of diplomatic balancing, managing cordial relationships with Western and non-Western powers from the US and the UK to Russia and China. He positioned the EPRDF as a US ally in the War on Terror, again projecting influence (including an invasion of Somalia in 2006), but also combating perceived security threats and opponents at home. Ethiopia also aligned with US policy on sanctions on Eritrea and the role of the International Criminal Court in Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK supported and cooperated with Ethiopia on all of the above. In the mid-2000s, DFID championed ambitious security sector reforms in Ethiopia. These did not proceed, but for six years ENDF officers up to the Chief of Staff attended exchange visits and training courses on security sector management in the UK. UK–Ethiopia security cooperation later attracted the attention of legal activists and human rights campaigners, who questioned the wisdom and appropriateness of support and training for institutions with poor human rights records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a troubling record on democratisation and human rights that included repression of political opposition, censorship and cancellation of elections, the EPRDF remained dominant until 2018. Internal population movement, uneven growth and demands for greater freedoms eventually fractured the alliance. By 2018, Ethiopia faced rising insecurity, popular protests and simmering conflicts in states including Afar, Somali Regional State and Oromia. In March, Abiy Ahmed, leader of the Oromo People’s Democratic Organization, was elected EPRDF chair. One month later, he was appointed prime minister. In December 2019, erstwhile members of the EPRDF created a new ‘Prosperity Party’ (PP) coalition, which incorporated new parties into the ruling coalition, but omitted ethnically based parties, including the now-disaffected TPLF. The stated PP/Abiy policy agenda included increased political freedoms, economic liberalisation and privatisation of state-owned enterprises. The poverty reduction and rural development agendas of previous EPRDF governments were jettisoned. Abroad, and by some at home, Abiy was welcomed as fresh and dynamic. However, notwithstanding the high-profile release of political prisoners, he and his allies began sidelining opponents and creating space for promised privatisation and economic liberalisation. Loosening the grip of former EPRDF members, including the TPLF, was key. While taking steps to centralise governance and unlock sections of the economy controlled by TPLF affiliates, Abiy also apparently agreed with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki and Somalia’s President Mohamed Abdullahi ‘Farmajo’ to act militarily against the TPLF. Meanwhile, internal rivalries and repression mounted, notably in 2020 towards Oromo opposition groups. In 2021, delayed national elections allowed Abiy to win popular endorsement for the PP agenda. The PP secured a resounding victory. Yet significant parts of the country were unable or unwilling to participate due to boycotts and insecurity. Allegations of manipulation were widespread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tigray was one regional state to boycott the national election. The TPLF had been returned to power there via a state-level election on 9 September 2020. Although declared successful by the Tigray election commission, the federal government, which at that point had postponed elections citing the Covid-19 pandemic, considered the process to be illegal. Tensions between the TPLF and federal government erupted into violence in November 2020. What was originally a political fight quickly grew into an internationalised civil war overlaid with harsh rhetoric, including mutual accusations of terrorism and genocide. Ethiopia’s national army, the ENDF, was backed by Eritrea and Somalia, as well as by sub-national special forces and ethnic militias, in a series of battles against the Tigray Defense Forces (TDF). Several hundred thousand have likely perished. Human rights organisations have documented atrocities and war crimes on all sides. The Ethiopian federal government faces the most damning criticism for using collective punishment against Tigray by stopping all government services, communications and media coverage and blocking humanitarian aid deliveries. Harassment and detention of not only Tigrayans but also other political opponents, journalists and critics has been marked. Many thousands have been displaced or have faced starvation due to crippling inflation and a severe economic contraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above events have changed Ethiopia’s relationship to the outside world. Security in the region has been reconfigured as Abiy brought in Somali and Eritrean forces to fight the TPLF. The UAE, Turkey, Iran and possibly China are thought to have provided military assistance to the federal government. Reports of atrocities, amplified by diaspora and social media, have drawn public condemnation from governments such as the US, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands and the EU. Many aid donors consequently stopped (the EU, the World Bank) or reoriented programmes away from central government channels, and a US preferential trade agreement was cancelled. While expressing concern and condemning atrocities, the UK approach has overall been more circumspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violence in Tigray has ebbed and flowed since breaking out in November 2020. A humanitarian ceasefire announced by the federal government in June 2021 was not fully honoured. Hostilities broke out again in August 2022, again involving Eritrean forces. In November 2022 a cessation of hostilities agreement was brokered by the AU, with US and Kenyan support. Implementing this agreement will be hugely challenging – a resumption of violence is a plausible scenario. At the time of writing, Ethiopia’s trajectory remains highly uncertain, not only due to the Tigray war but also because of the current political polarisation, unresolved grievances and conflicts in many parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uk-policy-priorities-and-engagements&quot;&gt;UK Policy Priorities and Engagements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section offers a summary of the UK’s engagements from 2015 to 2022 in the areas of development, diplomacy and defence in pursuit of its policy objectives outlined above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development and Humanitarian Engagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the past 20 years, Ethiopia has been the leading recipient of UK bilateral aid globally. Expenditure averaged around £300 million per annum between 2016 and 2020. This made the UK the second-largest donor after the US (see Figure 1), contributing around 11% of Ethiopia’s recorded aid income, as reported via the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (OECD–DAC). Approximately 60% of the UK’s bilateral aid budget has typically been channelled via central government programmes, the bulk allocated to multi-donor, multi-year funds that supported delivery of basic services. The UK also made significant Official Development Assistance (ODA) investments in other sectors such as drought response, water and sanitation, and refugee and migrant support. Smaller programmes have focused on human rights, peace and stability, and economic development. Examples include £6.5 million for the textiles industry, with subsidies to business parks to support their recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, and to fund TradeMark East Africa’s programme to reduce barriers to trade across the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XsEHBki.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Top Six OECD–DAC Donors to Ethiopia, 2012–21.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: OECD–DAC, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=crs1&quot;&gt;‘Creditor Reporting System’&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After decades of high aid allocations, from 2019 a sequence of events meant that the UK bilateral aid budget for Ethiopia began to shrink. Changing ministerial priorities brought a slight reduction in the budget from 2019 (£299 million) to 2020 (£254 million). The Covid-19 pandemic triggered further cuts, as economic forecasts took a downturn, followed by a reduction in the aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of GNI in November 2020. By 2021, UK bilateral spending had roughly halved compared to 2019. Despite briefly allocating more than the UK in budgetary terms in 2020, Germany returned to typical spending levels by 2021, as did other leading donors. The exception was the US, which markedly increased spending, mainly on humanitarian relief. The remaining UK bilateral aid allocation to Ethiopia of £120 million in 2021 was £134 million lower than the allocation in 2020. This was the largest cut – in absolute, though not proportional, terms – of any country’s budget worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reductions were accompanied by reallocations to different sectors following a series of natural disasters, shifting ministerial priorities, Covid-19 and the Tigray war. To give a sense of the changing priorities: in 2020, the UK allocated £254 million of bilateral ODA to Ethiopia. Humanitarian aid (£103 million) accounted for 40% of this budget, as compared to 15% in 2013. Health accounted for £55 million, other social infrastructure and services £29 million, and government and civil society £14 million. Expenditure on economic development and defence engagement (mostly non-ODA-funded) was cut to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diplomatic Engagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as supporting international development work, the UK’s diplomatic interest in Ethiopia has historically focused on issues ranging from trade promotion to migration, counterterrorism cooperation and the Ethiopian involvement in peacekeeping. Considerable energy has also been absorbed on consular cases involving dual nationals. Diplomatic relations were tested in early to mid-2021, as Western criticism of the Ethiopian government’s blockade of Tigray and reported human rights abuses led to recriminations. As explored below, the UK has taken a lower profile approach to the Tigray war than more prominent critics, such as the EU, the Republic of Ireland and the US, which quickly paused aid packages and publicly condemned Ethiopian government actions. The UK has attempted to position itself as constructively critical, while continuing to route its aid via government. Throughout the course of the Tigray war the UK has sought diplomatic engagement with the Ethiopian federal government at the highest level, lobbying for improved humanitarian access, ceasefires and talks. It has not invested high levels of political capital, however. For example, senior ministerial visits have been infrequent: in December 2022, recently appointed foreign secretary James Cleverly visited Ethiopia almost two years after his predecessor-but-one, Dominic Raab, who visited in January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defence and Security Engagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government has maintained a relationship with the Ethiopian Ministry of National Defence for over two decades and has a permanent defence attaché in the country. Defence-related expenditure is below £1 million per annum, mostly drawn from regional defence and Conflict Stability and Security Fund budgets with competing priorities, among them AMISOM. Prior to the partial withdrawal of ENDF troops from AMISOM in 2021, Ethiopia’s support to the mission was the UK’s principal focus. Many AMISOM troops have received training from the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK ambition on defence in Ethiopia has declined over time. From contemplating costly support to security sector reforms in the mid-2000s, the UK moved from running courses for senior government officials on security sector management to halting most cooperation outside peacekeeping training during the difficult transition years since 2018. Since that date, UK defence engagement has mainly focused on education and training in non-combat areas linked to the Ethiopian Peace Support Training Centre. Cooperation on counterterrorism has all but stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview-of-selected-outcomes&quot;&gt;Overview of Selected Outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter highlights a number of outcomes to which UK action has contributed in Ethiopia, whether through international development cooperation, defence engagement or diplomacy. The examples below are drawn from interview data, with interviewees identifying cases from within the wider UK portfolio of work in the country, as outlined in Chapter I. The cases – which interviewees viewed as broad examples of success – identify and analyse key factors that have enabled or constrained the UK’s attempts to further its stated Global Britain agenda of cultivating partnerships and linking development, defence, diplomacy and trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;telecoms-sector-liberalisation&quot;&gt;Telecoms Sector Liberalisation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the PP came to power in December 2019, following the EPRDF’s dissolution, major sectors of the Ethiopian economy were dominated by state monopolies and closed to foreign competition. In 2018, DFID and Department of International Trade (DIT) teams opened discussions with the government about liberalisation and privatisation. With the UK offering a £100-million grant for economic reform, the PP government committed to opening up the banking and telecoms sectors. The UK then provided technical support by funding a high-level adviser to help government develop policy options. A ‘Homegrown Economic Reform Programme’ followed, which included plans to restructure agriculture, manufacturing, mining, tourism, and information and communications technology, and open each to external competition. The World Bank and the IMF subsequently announced US$3 billion in loans to support planned reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK embassy decided to focus on the telecoms sector, perhaps as a model for others. This had a growing domestic market and solid infrastructure, thanks to the state-owned provider Ethiotel. Regional and international competitors were theoretically available to drive down prices. The FCDO funded an Ethiopian adviser, formerly of the IMF, to support the federal government on strategy. The World Bank then agreed to allocate grants and loans via a multi-donor trust fund. This was for technical assistance for telecoms liberalisation, which the UK also part-funded through an economic assistance programme, the Ethiopia Investment Advisory Facility. Former DFID development staff worked closely with former FCO political staff, the ambassador and the DIT delegation that was also housed at the embassy, who provided diplomatic and lobbying support and legal advice and outreach to UK companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2020, the Ethiopian government announced that two new telecoms provider licences would be put out to tender, establishing competition for Ethiotel. Shortly afterwards, Ethiotel halved its tariffs and built new towers across the country. The UK then funded the World Bank to develop another options paper to move the liberalisation process forward. Initial interest was shown by companies including Vodafone/Safaricom, MTN, Orange and Etisalat (UAE-owned). But tendering took place amidst news of the Tigray war. Only two bids were received, at lower values than anticipated. A bid from MTN worth approximately US$600 million was rejected by Ethiopia. In June 2021, the winning ‘Global Partnership for Ethiopia’ consortium was awarded a licence. Its bid, with a direct equity investment quoted at US$220 million, consisted of a mix of public and private investors: the UK’s Vodafone, with backing from the UK’s Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) Group, Kenya’s Safaricom, South Africa’s Vodacom Group, the US’s Development Finance Corporation, and Japan’s Sumitomo Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed in terms of the UK’s own agendas on prosperity and integrated approaches, the bidding process was a success. Embassy staff note that the winning consortium likely benefited from longstanding DFID support to Ethiopia’s industrial park development in the decade before, underscoring the value of long-term relationship building. Development, trade and diplomatic engagement had been used in a joined-up way. The winning bid was also seen as distinctive due to the involvement of the CDC Group, which directly addressed the UK’s prosperity agenda. And – at least on paper – the bid included commitments on women’s empowerment, new technologies, access to education, the investment of more than US$8 billion, impacting over 1 million jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Safaricom Ethiopia network went live in Addis Ababa in October 2022. Western hopes that Abiy’s government would liberalise other sectors have not, however, materialised. The federal government’s attention has for now shifted to maintaining foreign currency flows and stabilising the country’s wrecked economy. An early return to the liberalisation policy agenda, including moves to introduce more competition in the telecoms sector, looks unlikely. Critics, meanwhile, have noted the lack of a societal consensus on the PP’s rapid privatisation and liberalisation agenda, and expressed doubts about the intentions of a government which has no shame in using policy agendas to isolate opponents. For supporters of the EPRDF government’s economic model, there is also suspicion that introducing foreign competition will lead to expatriation of profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;support-to-basic-services&quot;&gt;Support to Basic Services&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK development assistance to Ethiopia has a long history of providing budgetary and technical support via government institutions. Ongoing examples are: the Sustaining and Accelerating Primary Health Care in Ethiopia programme, worth approximately £288 million, delivered with the Ethiopian Ministry of Health; and a Rural Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programme, costing £106 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OECD–DAC donors have taken different positions on working through the federal government of Ethiopia since the outbreak of the Tigray war in November 2020. The EU ceased budget support to the government two months later. While continuing people-focused ‘human development’ projects, the World Bank followed. Despite reduced budgets and a reorientation towards humanitarian relief, in areas such as health, education, water and sanitation, the UK continued to provide financial aid and technical assistance to government departments. It also continued to play a strong technical role in donor–government coordination meetings. The UK stood with a minority of OECD–DAC donors including Germany, Italy and Nordic countries in maintaining support to the federal government’s programmes. It initially argued that prolonged aid withdrawals would further weaken government systems and put additional stress on a crisis-affected population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net effect of aid cuts and stoppages is difficult to ascertain in the midst of a war, drought and economic contraction, but access to and quality of health and education in Ethiopia are believed to have declined as a result. By continuing to work with the Ethiopian government, however, the UK attracted criticism for ‘soft-pedalling’ on human rights and accountability. Questions can be also raised about the effectiveness of only one leading OECD–DAC donor using a reduced aid budget to maintain the social systems of a state with little professed interest in social services and a war to fight. The federal government did not move to replace donor funding when aid cuts were announced, prioritising above all its security agenda. Moreover, national budgeting trends since 2018 show the Ethiopian government drastically deprioritising basic services, in line with the PP leadership’s interest in the private sector and infrastructure development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to arguments about the rights and wrongs of maintaining government systems, UK officials defended their approach as a way of avoiding alienating their Ethiopian counterparts, and as a means of maintaining dialogue and influence at a technical and political level with the federal government, bilateral and multilateral donors, international financial institutions (IFIs), and indeed Tigray’s leadership. In early 2022, the UK sought to use its IFI board membership, alongside its bilateral donor relations, to lobby the World Bank to restart ‘pro-poor’ programming – on condition that the federal government showed some progress on providing humanitarian access and service delivery in Tigray, increased state expenditure on service delivery elsewhere, and worked towards a cessation of hostilities. Although the political and development sections of the embassy collaborated on this, there was no significant progress for months to come. A World Bank programme worth US$300 million was nevertheless approved at board level in April 2022, part-allocated for victims of sexual violence but also for reconstruction and water, sanitation and education support via the Ministry of Finance. Critics, including the local EU delegation, were fearful that this prematurely rewarded sluggish government moves to conclude the war. However, by July 2022, the European Commission had approved €81.5 million, mostly for health and education in conflict-affected areas, to be channelled through NGOs, the UN and member-state development agencies. Its much larger (around €1 billion) multi-year development budget remains on hold due to outstanding concerns, including around human rights monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the exact sequence of events allows for different interpretations, the Tigray war erupted again in August 2022. As a result, the very limited humanitarian access that had been provided to Tigray stopped. Tigray’s services remained entirely cut off until December 2022, while countrywide service delivery has been degraded across the board. With a new phase of the Tigray conflict in full swing, the UK hardened its position, now arguing against any new World Bank spending until a cessation of hostilities was agreed. It also reportedly lobbied against an IMF mission to Ethiopia that could potentially have unlocked a valuable foreign currency loan. The question of whether to adopt a ‘politics first’ or a ‘development first’ approach, and under what conditions development aid should restart, continues to be debated, both within and between bilateral and multilateral donors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example illustrates the dilemmas and limitations of delivering aid amidst conflict, and in a ‘non-developmental’ state. It points to the value of aligning political and technical approaches, the importance of maintaining multiple relationships, the need for flexibility, and the potential reputational costs of pursuing a minority position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-negotiations-in-somali-regional-state&quot;&gt;Political Negotiations in Somali Regional State&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than two decades, an armed movement, the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF), has fought for self-determination for Somalis in the Somali Regional State (SRS) of Ethiopia. In 2012, the Kenyan government began to mediate peace talks between the Ethiopian government and the ONLF. The initiative followed many months of quiet background diplomacy with the involvement of UK-based NGO Conciliation Resources (CR), which advised the parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CR provided negotiation trainings and advice for six years, helping to develop a ‘roadmap’ for peace. In October 2018 a peace deal, the Asmara agreement, drafted with inputs from CR, was signed in Eritrea by the ONLF and the Ethiopian federal government. It put an end to hostilities and opened the door to the ONLF leadership to transition into a political party and take part in formal politics. CR has since accompanied the actors, providing advice and organising learning visits and technical support to the Ethiopian Federal Reconciliation Commission formed in 2018. CR also assisted in the establishment of the Somali Regional Reconciliation Commission, which is now operational. CR’s work has also included supporting civil society groups with the capacity to represent victims of human rights abuses to articulate their needs within the peace process, and the inclusion of marginalised groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was initially funded by the UK and Swiss governments from 2012 to 2014, and later by the Swedish government. Despite strong interest from the UK embassy, funding was episodic, coming from different instruments over time with stops and starts. This frustrated organisational planning. Nevertheless, the involvement of a British-funded NGO gave the UK a conduit to promote a more inclusive process. Marginalised, including rural, populations have been able to participate in the regional political process, and it has been suggested that the initiative contributed to the later formation of a women’s caucus in the Somali regional parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have argued that the Somali region peace initiative contributed to wider peace and stability in the region. The Somali region did see reduced violence in the wake of the Asmara agreement, and both an FCDO project completion report and an independent review assess the CR project as having made a positive contribution to stability. But key provisions of the Asmara agreement are still to be implemented, and although SRS is relatively stable compared to Oromia or Tigray, regional elections in 2021 saw a boycott by opposition parties. The Asmara agreement did not prevent a longstanding border dispute with the neighbouring Afar region from flaring up. Combined with a regional drought, this has seen significant displacement and killings. To the extent that the region has seen some progress on stability, wider political changes likely acted as enablers: a rapprochement between the Eritrean and Ethiopian federal governments; Addis’s removal of a repressive regional governor, Abdi Iley, in 2018; and a change in the ONLF’s leadership. At the same time, CR proved adroit in capitalising on these dynamics, with UK backing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An indirect benefit to the UK government has been improved political access in the region. In parallel, the UK was also focusing its attention on sub-national (Somali-dominated) political entities across Ethiopia’s international borders – from Somaliland to northern Kenya and Somalia’s federal member states. Cross-border collaboration and the movement of goods and people across Ethiopia’s international border into northern Kenya and Somaliland has also improved. CR’s work and the UK’s political and financial support will only have contributed to, rather than delivered, such outcomes. The context in the Somali region and neighbouring territories remains daunting. The engagement could still have enduring effects, however. For the UK, it illustrates that combining long-term, low-key investments with political savvy and a trusted partner can bring results under the right conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;peacekeeping-training&quot;&gt;Peacekeeping Training&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has long maintained a relationship with the Ethiopian Ministry of National Defence. From 2010 to 2020, exchange visits and security sector management courses were run for senior military and political figures, including a defence minister. These are thought by the UK to have been highly regarded in Ethiopian government circles, and to have given the UK leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 2018, MoD support moved to focus on strengthening the Ethiopian International Peace Support Training Institute. Established in 2011, the centre was conceived as centre of excellence for training and deployment of military and civilian peacekeepers to AU and UN missions. Ethiopian military graduates receive training on a range of non-combat skills relevant for deployment in peace support operations. Donors include Japan, Germany, the US and the UK, each of whom has invested around £1.5 million. While Germany funded a research facility, accommodation and a canteen, Japan and the UK funded the construction of classrooms and delivered training in non-combat subjects such as combating sexual and gender-based violence, strategic planning, humanitarian law and countering IEDs. UK funding supports around 90 students per annum. Post-training evaluations are positive overall, although students often ask for more practical or combat-oriented training. The UK estimates that around 75% of Peace Support Training Institute graduates go on to serve in peace support operations. Missions such AMISOM have relied heavily on Ethiopian contributions, arguably helping to contain Al-Shabaab in southwest Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as development work is sometimes claimed to aid wider foreign policy objectives, UK defence-related projects (peacekeeping training and beyond) are thought by the MoD to have offered the UK access to and influence with political decision-makers. Earlier security sector management training courses helped to open discussions about improving governance and accountability within the security sector, previously a DFID responsibility. But although the UK and Ethiopian defence ministries are still in routine contact, the Tigray war, weaker government-to-government relations and lower UK budgets make this agenda unrealistic for the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;crisis-response--the-tigray-conflict&quot;&gt;Crisis Response – The Tigray Conflict&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a slow start, the UK mounted diplomatic, humanitarian and consular responses to the November 2020 outbreak of conflict in Tigray. As part of the diplomatic response, then foreign secretary Dominic Raab met Abiy in Addis Ababa on 22 January 2021, urging an end to violence and humanitarian access and action on human rights. In May 2021, the UK Special Envoy for Famine Prevention and Humanitarian Affairs and the FCDO Director General for Africa visited Tigray, before calling for a humanitarian ceasefire. Efforts were also made to bring pressure to bear at the UN in New York and to reach out to the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, a UK national.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the UK’s humanitarian contributions were significant. For example, data from the UN’s Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund Annual Report for 2021 shows UK contributions at US$18.3 million. At embassy level, humanitarian advisers mobilised funds from crisis reserves and sought reallocations from development budgets. The UN Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund places the UK as the second-most generous humanitarian donor in 2021, after Germany, which spent US$24.7 million, and ahead of the US, which spent US$12 million. A series of UK funding announcements were made through 2021 and early 2022. In October 2021, £29 million was announced for those affected by the conflict. On top of an existing allocation of £76 million in humanitarian support, in January 2022, £5 million in new funding was announced for a drought in the south, £5 million for health and education services for people affected by conflict, and £4.5 million for peacebuilding and human rights. The embassy meanwhile sought to maintain relations with the federal government at working and senior political levels, lobbying repeatedly for humanitarian access and respect for international humanitarian law, possibly even hoping for a mediation role for the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tigray blockade policy and reports of battlefield atrocities drew UK ministers into public criticism of the federal government in 2021. UK officials nevertheless counselled that ‘megaphone diplomacy’ was unlikely to work. The UK sought to build a ‘critical friend’ profile for itself in-country instead. Attempts to maintain a nuanced UK position may have had benefits in private but in public, the Ethiopian government responded negatively to all critics, fostering a blanket social media campaign that denounced ‘anti-Ethiopian’ ‘imperialists’. Some observers, including many Tigray activists, meanwhile suspected the UK of soft-pedalling on human rights, due to, variously, double standards, racism or commercial interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the diplomatic aspects of the crisis, UK–Ethiopia relations were tested in November 2021 when Tigrayan forces advanced south from Tigray towards Addis Ababa. The UK government drew down diplomatic staff and called on UK nationals to leave. Other countries followed. The rapid process of withdrawing some 50 out of 70 diplomats from the embassy angered federal government officials and loyalists, many of whom saw the move as affirming a Tigrayan position, or pro-Tigrayan claims of impending victory. The withdrawals may have been a sensible proactive measure but proved unnecessary when US diplomatic pressure and ENDF drone attacks forced a TDF retreat. UK staff began to return five to six weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has since sought to maintain its ‘critical friend’ approach in Ethiopia, using working-level channels while seeking influence up to prime ministerial level. Lobbying for improved humanitarian access, a ceasefire and possible talks continued, bilaterally and with allies, throughout 2022. The scale of humanitarian need continued to grow, however. A humanitarian ceasefire first agreed in March 2022 was not adhered to. Conflict then restarted in August. At the time of writing it is debatable whether the UK approach or the more public and strident positions adopted by others have shifted federal government behaviour. Much is not yet in the public domain. It is too early to know whether the November 2022 agreement brokered by the AU in Pretoria and Nairobi will shift the dynamics between Tigray and Addis. The UK remains officially supportive of AU mediation efforts. Although it did not play a role in the Pretoria peace negotiations of October 2022, it may be hopeful of playing a more direct role in future, building on the ‘critical friend’ approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enablers-and-constraints&quot;&gt;Enablers and Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter II highlighted positive examples of the UK’s development, diplomacy and defence engagements in Ethiopia. Drawing on these examples and on supplementary interviews, this chapter identifies the key factors that appear to have constrained or enabled the UK’s actions in pursuing the Global Britain agenda in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operating-context&quot;&gt;Operating Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed, the operating context in Ethiopia has worsened markedly since 2018. A country once seen as a strong partner for international development, a fledgling trading partner, and a regional stabiliser, is now a major stability risk due to political intransigence and miscalculation. This is a highly challenging context in which to execute UK policy objectives. Longer-term agendas that have featured prominently in UK policy, such as trade and development, now have an uncertain future. Ethiopia’s stuttering political transition means a loss of direction and vision. It has also reversed hard-won socioeconomic development gains, causing widespread insecurity, inflation, starvation and death, conditions that will pose challenges for decades. The worsening context needs to be factored in when assessing the UK’s progress on its Global Britain agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK built a strong reputation for itself in Ethiopia over the last two decades, driven in large part by substantial allocations of ODA that helped to fuel impressive reductions in poverty. Given the centrality of aid to the UK–Ethiopia relationship, a more than 50% budget cut has posed real challenges. Reductions in UK aid budgets have registered strongly with UK partners, and at working level with government. Informed Ethiopians feel the UK is losing influence as a result. Reduced budgets have, however, spurred some innovative thinking, with attempts to involve such organisations as HM Revenue and Customs, Ofcom and the City of London in telecoms work, and to ‘crowd-in’ World Bank funding for basic services and ‘social safety net’ programmes as a way of substituting for a reduced bilateral development budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The November 2020 announcement of the reduction in the UK aid budget to 0.5% GNI ushered in a period of ongoing uncertainty. Due to constantly shifting priorities, budgets and ministerial turnover, budgeting horizons have shrunk to one year at best. By mid-March 2022, the 2022–23 bilateral aid budget total for Ethiopia still had not been agreed. This negatively impacts the ability to plan, deliver and maintain good relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More positively, as budget cuts fall on programmes, not operations, staffing levels in Ethiopia were broadly maintained by the FCDO and MoD in the period 2015–21. The number of development (formerly DFID) advisory posts has somewhat reduced. The DIT, meanwhile, has increased its presence, appointing a director to head the office in Addis Ababa and recruiting additional staff to pursue a more joined-up approach to trade and development, in line with the Global Britain agenda. Research suggests that FCDO staff are perceived by counterparts in civil society, government and bilateral and multilateral agencies as bringing valuable technical skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategy&quot;&gt;Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the EPRDF years, socioeconomic development, closely followed by stability and counterterrorism, was uppermost among the UK’s objectives in Ethiopia. These objectives were felt to be consistent with other goals, and it was assumed that stability and poverty reduction would over time contribute to democratisation and improved governance. Post- 2016, UK governments leaned further towards pursuing trade and mutual prosperity, as set out in the 2021 Integrated Review. The arrival of the 2018 Abiy government was seen as a great opportunity. Critics have accused the UK of adopting a naïve ‘blank cheque’ approach to the Abiy transition, and in the years 2019–21, the UK approach was found wanting. Many now see the UK – and indeed other Western countries – as lacking clear objectives or a viable strategy for Ethiopia. Certainly, the UK, despite macro-level strategies such as the Integrated Review and the FCDO’s unpublished strategy for Africa, has not had a detailed strategy to guide decision-making across all sectors of its engagement in Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen incremental progress on joining up the UK’s development and diplomatic efforts in Ethiopia. This is partly due to the changing country context, which for a short time appeared encouraging for foreign trade and investment. But the shift towards more integrated working across different arms of the UK government in Ethiopia was initiated by the UK government’s overall post-Brexit foreign policy, later accentuated by the merger of the FCO and DFID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FCO–DFID merger process has not been much noticed outside UK government circles. For more than two decades, DFID built an enviable reputation for the UK in Ethiopia, with its technical leadership and generous funding, and among those Ethiopians who follow international development debates, most expect the UK’s reputation to suffer as a result of DFID’s closure. Internally, although other events – for example, the Covid-19 pandemic and aid cuts – have been in play, the merger process is seen as time consuming and difficult. Business processes have had to be revised repeatedly. Working practices are now settling down, and the concept of integrated working is becoming more normalised, regardless of formal working arrangements. Examples of this cited by interviewees include international development staff becoming better at spotting trade opportunities, and humanitarian advisers better at factoring in the political context around famine and access questions in Tigray. At the same time, interviewees note that political staff have worked more closely with development colleagues to lobby the Ethiopian government, and to lobby IFIs to link future lending to conflict de-escalation, humanitarian access and respect for humanitarian law. Transitioning formerly separate staff into fully integrated teams, particularly with a significantly larger (former) DFID presence, is, nevertheless, taking time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;leadership&quot;&gt;Leadership&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political instability in the UK, with high rates of ministerial turnover and public questioning of politicians’ integrity, has left many Ethiopians doubtful about UK leadership. UK ministerial attention to Ethiopia is meanwhile seen as having declined from previous years, with no senior ministers visiting between January 2021 and December 2022. This has been noticed by Ethiopians, with comparisons made with France, Canada and the US, each of which is seen as having attempted to address the Tigray war at a presidential and prime ministerial level with more consistency than the UK, via ongoing calls, visits and statements. Periodic clampdowns on African migration, work permit restrictions and reports of worsening living conditions in the West are also negatively influencing attitudes towards the UK and the West. Some Ethiopian interviewees felt, however, that Western legitimacy problems dated back as far as the 2003 Gulf War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;relationships&quot;&gt;Relationships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has maintained a range of productive relationships in Ethiopia and with regional and international partners. This includes European and Euro-Atlantic countries, from Canada to the US, Japan, and many others with whom the UK has cooperated successfully on trade, defence, development and humanitarian agendas. It also includes multilateral agencies and IFIs in relation to which the UK is both a donor and a partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of DFID, however, along with Brexit and budget cuts, has led many to assume that British influence is in decline. It is common to hear that the UK must have lost ‘traction’ by leaving the EU. The UK has significantly reduced influence over EU aid allocations, and UK officials no longer attend routine EU cooperation meetings, such as those of the EU Heads of Mission. This has necessitated developing workarounds, meeting in other forums and communicating informally. Interviewees reflected that at times, officials have had to work harder to maintain relationships with the Ethiopian government. Other interviewees felt that moving outside EU decision-making circles has made the UK freer in its bilateral dealings with Ethiopia and freed up time previously spent on intra-EU negotiations and administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK established a good reputation for itself in Ethiopia on the basis of DFID’s leading financial and technical role in international development. Evidence of Western donor influence over successive Ethiopian governments’ handling of sensitive issues around governance, human rights and democratisation is, however, hard to find. Nevertheless, Ethiopian observers have tended to see the UK as technically competent on international development questions, but less principled than countries such as the Republic of Ireland, Denmark or Sweden on matters of human rights and democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the close alignment of the two countries’ governments prior to 2020, the Tigray conflict has upended the UK–Ethiopia relationship. With the Abiy government’s lack of interest in poverty reduction, the development-oriented foundations of the UK–Ethiopia relationship have been shaken. A falling aid budget only accentuated this problem. Meanwhile, muted UK criticisms of Ethiopian federal government strategy have left relations intact but strained. There has been no public acknowledgement of the UK’s attempt to distinguish somewhat its own approach from more strident (for example, EU, Irish and US) positions on the conflict. Views may be different behind closed doors, as the apparently productive meetings between the new UK foreign secretary and Abiy in December 2022 suggest. At the same time, some have drawn conclusions from the fact that a leaked Ethiopian foreign ministry re-engagement strategy towards Western actors did not distinguish the UK as having its own position on the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethiopian perceptions of external actors have been strongly influenced by the question of their position on the Tigray war. Those sympathetic to the opposition often see external actors, including the UK, as negligent for not holding the federal government and Eritrea to account. The reasons offered vary from callous disregard to an interest in commercial deals with Ethiopian companies and the federal government. A contrast is often drawn between strenuous Western support for, and investment in, Ukraine, and limited efforts to assist Tigray. Conversely, those more supportive of the federal government’s Tigray strategy tend to condemn foreign criticism as imperialist or as embodying double standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, the fast pace of the Tigray war seems to have wrongfooted the West at points. The US, the EU and the UK have all arguably struggled to adjust their approach to events and have changed tack more than once. For example, while the US proved a useful co-sponsor of the recent Pretoria peace talks, initial public condemnation from the US State Department in the early stages of the Tigray war was bitterly received by the federal government and not forgotten. The hand of non-Western powers has probably been strengthened in comparison. Given recent tensions, Ethiopia arguably sees Russia, Turkey (a supplier of drone technology to the ENDF), and China (supportive of non-interference via the UN) as its staunchest allies. This could change. As the history of Western and Soviet relations with Ethiopia in the 1970s and 1980s shows, Ethiopia can pivot quickly in favour of perceived interests. And the UK’s less strident positioning might yet bear fruit, with access maintained and relationships forged, as in the recent apparently productive discussions between the UK foreign secretary and the Ethiopian prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis in this paper suggests that the UK has been able to make limited progress on aspects of its ‘Global Britain’ agenda. Examples can be found of the UK combining defence, diplomacy and development, pursuing trade and prosperity agendas and – in a more mixed fashion – forging partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has been constrained by a number of factors: smaller and unpredictable budgets; an unplanned institutional merger; the absence of a focused in-country strategy; and weak leadership. At the same time, the FCO–DFID merger and ODA budget cuts spurred fresh thinking about leveraging different relationships and funding sources. But benefits around joined-up working have, at least in the short term, probably been eclipsed by losing the well-known DFID brand. Leaving the EU has not been a major constraint. It is, however, seen as reducing UK influence by Ethiopian observers, even if offering new freedoms. While the UK is still regarded as a capable and relevant actor, with skilled personnel and a measure of influence in certain areas, the overall picture is one of a relative decline in status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key issue, however, has been the changed operating context since 2018. Early promise has yielded to widespread insecurity, hunger and violence in Ethiopia, reversing decades of socioeconomic progress. The PP leadership has pursued zero-sum politics and turned away from poverty reduction and the ‘developmental state’ rhetoric of its predecessor. Ethiopia may be facing its most difficult challenges in recent history. Any shared vision for the future has gone, and the situation could worsen before it improves. It is no longer possible for external actors to ‘align with’ the Ethiopian government, deploying aid as a foundation for wider socioeconomic development and stability. This change, coupled with wartime conditions, also limits the immediate relevance of UK defence engagement. On the other hand, it is perhaps too early to judge the utility of the UK’s ‘critical friend’ diplomatic stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provided it is prepared to make fresh choices, despite its declining influence, the UK may be able to build on its current position. If the November 2022 cessation of hostilities holds, it will provide a basis for confidence building between Tigray and Addis Ababa. It will not, however, resolve the deeper issues, which require careful stewardship of multiple peacemaking, dialogue, reconciliation and accountability processes. The UK could, in theory, work with others in support of such efforts, providing technical leadership on a number of critical peacemaking and reconstruction questions in which it has expertise, from ceasefire monitoring to stabilisation, peacebuilding, governance, security sector reform and transitional justice. Learning from the past, however, a principled and coherent stance should be sought on these policy agendas among as broad a range of international actors as possible. While recognising the limited influence that external critics and donors, including the UK, have had on Ethiopian governments’ decision-making, questions of rights, accountability, self-determination and democracy should inform clear benchmarks for working closely with or through government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at RUSI convened a roundtable in partnership with the Institute for International and Strategic Affairs in Paris. The discussion, held under the Chatham House rule, gathered representatives from government ministries and agencies, the private sector – including banking institutions, law firms and consulting companies – and civil society. The event is part of RUSI’s ongoing study of EU sanctions implementation and wider responses to illicit finance (Euro SIFMANet), funded by the National Endowment for Democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sanctions-implementation-in-france&quot;&gt;Sanctions Implementation in France&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable opened with a description of the political and operational context within which France is currently implementing sanctions. On the one hand, while the international political discussion is regarded as having achieved consensus on the need to implement sanctions and now focuses on ensuring their effective implementation, in France there remains a debate as to whether sanctions are worth imposing, driven primarily by far-left and far-right political parties, representing only 15% of the French population and yet constituting a very vocal minority. As further testament to the political context of France, participants at the roundtable from the private sector noted that the statement by French President Emmanuel Macron on the need to keep communication channels with Russia open was ill-received abroad but not, to the same extent, among the French population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the operational framework for implementing sanctions, a representative from Direction générale (DG) du Trésor (French Ministry of Finance) described the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the ‘negotiating party’ in sanctions, while DG Trésor oversees implementation. Unlike other countries in the SIFMANet project, France has not had to introduce new laws to ensure it is able to effectively implement the restrictive measures on Russia that have been introduced since February 2022, but DG Trésor has reportedly doubled the number of staff dedicated to sanctions, as well as improving its internal departmental cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underlying the confidence displayed by officials in France’s ability to implement sanctions on Russia is the belief expressed by the public sector in France’s strong level of knowledge and experience in implementing sanctions, built on prior experience of responding to previous UN and EU sanctions regimes, as well as national sanctions for terrorist financing. This estimation is reflected in the latest Mutual Evaluation Report of France by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in May 2022. The strength of understanding of anti-money-laundering and counterterrorist-financing (AML/CFT) risks in the French financial sector, and its supervisors, is a key pillar on which the implementation of Russia sanctions relies. For example, representatives from DG Trésor highlighted the benefits they believe stem from a robust national AML/CFT system, suggesting that as trade flows largely involve financial institutions, and French banks have strong AML/CFT transaction and client monitoring systems, they are in an ideal position to also monitor for activity in breach of sanctions, and thus ensure the compliance of their clients. The French sanctions implementation system has thus placed banks on the front line of sanctions implementation, relying on their AML compliance capabilities, which require them to report any suspicious transactions to Tracfin, France’s financial intelligence unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the unprecedented range of restrictive measures imposed by the EU on Russia now poses a new challenge for France’s capabilities. As noted above, the level of knowledge and experience of the financial sector is assessed positively, but, with the introduction of sectoral sanctions, the non-financial sector – labelled by the FATF as Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professionals (DNFBPs) – also faces the task of implementing sanctions, often for the first time. Of note in the discussion was the risk described by DG Trésor that companies often do not understand their value/supply chains in detail and thus face difficulties identifying where restrictions need to be implemented, and smaller companies face issues related to overall awareness of sanctions and capacity to absorb the extra work required. Thus, the expertise of DNFBPs is insufficient, with authorities highlighting the real-estate sector in particular. DG Trésor emphasised that it does not expect companies to have a complete understanding of the sanctions regimes from the beginning, and that it provides support to the private sector to ensure that their implementation improves over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area of concern is de-risking, triggered by concerns in the private sector – particularly among banks – that they do not have sufficient information about their customers to ensure compliance with sanctions requirements. This is a longstanding problem connected with sanctions regimes and – like authorities in many other countries – DG Trésor noted that they cannot control the commercial decisions of the private sector and thus de-risking is inevitable, as private sector actors seek to manage the risks they perceive from the raft of sanctions aimed at Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the controls exercised by the authorities in France, the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (ACPR) checks how designation measures are implemented in the banking sector. The ACPR has conducted onsite inspections at banks to check their systems, looking at the use and effectiveness of the private vendor screening systems on which they rely heavily. Representatives from DG Trésor noted that financial institutions can have varying degrees of risk sensitivity and set their systems accordingly. This results in differing outcomes in the effectiveness of banks’ sanctions screening efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, DG Trésor contended that a combination of a strong national AML/CFT framework, rigorous implementation of that framework by financial institutions, and a robust supervisory regime provides confidence that sanctions are being properly implemented in France. Exceptions exist, however. For example, representatives from DG Trésor noted that the agency supervising the real-estate sector has also conducted inspections, with less encouraging results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In relation to enforcement against sanctions circumvention, customs authorities are legally charged with monitoring circumvention, which is a criminal offence in France under the French Customs Code, and the same authorities are active in the freezing and management of assets other than real estate, such as yachts and artwork. A representative from DG Trésor estimated that assets frozen in France now amount to around €1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the positive picture painted by the public sector, representatives from civil society noted that there is still a lack of data transparency to assess whether sanctions are being well implemented. In this regard, the discussion also addressed the recent ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) limiting public access to beneficial ownership registries, which some participants from both public and private sectors admitted disagreeing with. A remaining weakness of the company registries in France is found in the lack of beneficial ownership information for companies registered before 2017. While companies registered in the last five years had to provide information on this, companies registered before that date have still not submitted it. The problem of multiple registries existing in the country was intended to be solved with the introduction of a new unified registry in January 2023 that would integrate all registries into a unique resource. At the time of the roundtable, this new registry was closed to public access in accordance with the ECJ ruling. However, on 19 January 2023, the day after the roundtable, France reopened its registries to the public until such time as a new framework is implemented that will give access to those with legitimate interest, which will include civil society and journalists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;international-challenges&quot;&gt;International Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the overall agreement among participants at the roundtable on France’s capabilities to implement sanctions, concerns were raised by all participants across both sectors about the ongoing implementation challenges at EU and international levels. Consistent with previous SIFMANet country visits, there was a consensus among participants that lack of harmonisation among member states at EU level poses a major challenge to the effective implementation of sanctions. The fact that sanctions are adopted at EU level but implemented by member states leads to a divergence in implementation as a function of political will, national legal frameworks and private sector interpretation. An example shared by a representative from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), not related to Russia, involved a sanctioned bank in Myanmar that owned the majority of shares in a subsidiary. In this case, some member states believed it acceptable to do business with the subsidiary bank, while others did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MFA representative also described the asymmetries between the EU and the US in implementing sanctions. Before February 2022, sanctions were said to be a source of transatlantic tension, but this changed after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with ensuing close coordination of mission across the Atlantic, although designations and implementation are not fully aligned. Despite this broad alignment of purpose, the failure of the EU to match the vigour with which the US implements sanctions is notable and represents a systemic vulnerability in the Western response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As sanctions implementation challenges have grown in the EU, the question of a centralised EU sanctions authority has increasingly arisen. Representatives from the MFA pointed to the coordination of implementation and enforcement achieved in the US via the role of the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). They also noted the extent to which US sanctions can have extraterritorial application, as well as the US’s ability to impose secondary sanctions on third countries that engage with sanctioned entities, thus providing a far greater reach and degree of deterrence than EU sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with what has been revealed in the transatlantic dialogue on Iran sanctions, most participants in the roundtable, from both the public and private sectors, expressed concern about the implications of US secondary sanctions, but did acknowledge that the EU could make greater use of its existing tools, for example the size and reach of its economy, and legal provisions that do allow for extraterritorial reach of EU sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was less agreement among participants on the utility of creating an EU-level body designed in the style of OFAC, in charge of implementing sanctions in a uniform manner across the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a description of the wider international context, a participant from the private sector presented a study that found that two-thirds of the world’s population lives in countries that are neutral or positive towards Russia and have not condemned its invasion. Thus, some countries embrace approaches that support the avoidance and evasion of EU and allied country sanctions. Examples include countries seeking opportunities to ‘de-dollarise’, and the emergence of alternatives to the SWIFT payments messaging system, such as the People’s Bank of China’s Cross-Border Interbank Payment System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of sanctions evasion, representatives from the MFA noted that Russian circumvention networks operate at a very low level and are often difficult to identify. They agreed that smuggling networks that enable countries like North Korea or Belarus to evade sanctions are not big enough to support the significantly larger size of the Russian economy. However, participants from both the public and private sectors noted that Russia can obtain the knowhow from Iran on how to evade sanctions, particularly related to energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;next-steps-for-the-eu&quot;&gt;Next Steps for the EU&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, roundtable participants were not convinced that establishing an OFAC-style body in the EU would be an appropriate step forward, and judged that such a move might be met with resistance from those who increasingly call for greater sovereignty of member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants considered that an intermediate step might be the creation of an EU High Representative on Sanctions to facilitate coordination (it is worth noting that the US State Department has long had an Office of Sanctions Coordination headed by an ambassador). In this sense, the appointment of former EU Ambassador to the US David O’Sullivan as International Special Envoy for the Implementation of EU Sanctions was regarded as a positive step at EU level, to improve the dialogue with third countries regarding Russian circumvention of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also agreement that the EU must make more use of its economic heft to promote compliance in the world. A consensus of views from both the public and private sector described the oil price cap as a successful tool in getting third countries to support measures to restrict the funding of the Russian war machine, as it allows such countries to support the West while at the same time bringing benefit to themselves through their compliance. Participants from both the public and private sector agreed that the EU still has tools to leverage in this regard. For example, Regulation 269/2014 was amended several times in 2022 and now allows the EU to sanction non-EU companies for engaging in business with EU-sanctioned companies and facilitating the circumvention of sanctions; and the EU also has a collection of ‘high-risk’ lists that it can use to indicate heightened financial crime risk (specifically related to money laundering and tax evasion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the roundtable unanimously concluded that the EU must persist in improving the effectiveness of its sanctions regime by defining and clarifying designations and being consistent – that is, ensuring harmonisation of sanctions enforcement across all member states. As a participant remarked, ‘2022 was the year for designing sanctions; 2023 is the year to implement them and close loopholes’.&lt;/p&gt;

The Ukrainian military has also performed remarkably well against a much larger and initially better-equipped Russian military, in part due to the innovation of its forces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prussian general and military theorist Carl von Clausewitz wrote that war is filled with unpredictability and that “in war more than anywhere else in the world things happen differently to what we had expected.” Just ask Russian political and military leaders in charge of the war in Ukraine today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting puzzles is how Ukraine — which has a significantly smaller military, weaker military capabilities, a limited defense industrial base, and a smaller economy — was able to blunt a Russian blitzkrieg and then conduct a series of counterattacks against dug-in Russian forces. Before its invasion in February 2022, Russia had nearly five times as many military personnel as Ukraine, a defense budget eleven times larger, an economy almost eight times larger, and significantly better military capabilities. Examples of Russian capabilities included advanced fighter aircraft (such as the Su-34 and Su-35), artillery (such as the 2S7 Pion, BM-21 Grad, and 2S4 Tulpan), main battle tanks (such as the T-72 and T-90), nuclear weapons, and one of the world’s most feared offensive cyber capabilities. Yet Russia’s preponderance of power has failed to deliver it swift victory on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how the war has proceeded and how it may change in the future, this analysis asks three main questions: What is the current state of the war? What factors — particularly Ukrainian military innovation — have contributed to battlefield performance? What are the future prospects for continued Ukrainian innovation and the requirements for additional Western assistance in a war of attrition?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, this analysis adopts a mixed-methods approach. It draws on interviews with individuals involved in the war, including those who have fought on the Ukrainian side and those who have provided technical support to the Ukrainian military. It supplements these interviews with primary and secondary sources, as well as satellite imagery. Finally, it builds an operational-level map of the Ukrainian battlefield to highlight the force disposition and territory that Ukraine has retaken throughout the war. A separate document explains the methodology used to build the battlefield map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis makes three main arguments. First, the war in Ukraine has become a war of attrition characterized by dug-in forces, trenches, human-wave attacks, artillery barrages, and high casualties on both sides. Russia likely suffered more combat fatalities in Ukraine in the first year of the war than in all of its wars since World War II combined, including the Soviet and Russian wars in Afghanistan and Chechnya. The average rate of Russian regular and irregular soldiers killed per month in Ukraine over the first year of the war was at least 25 times the number killed per month in Russia’s war in Chechnya and at least 35 times the number killed per month in the Soviet Union’s war in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Ukraine has performed extraordinarily well against an adversary with a significant advantage in material resources. One factor that has likely contributed to Ukraine’s performance is military innovation, exemplified by Ukraine’s utilization of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) in combined arms operations. Many of Ukraine’s innovations have come from the bottom up, thanks to a military environment that encourages and enables junior officers to seek innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, while military innovation will be necessary as the war continues, it will not be sufficient to outweigh the matériel needs of the Ukrainian military, such as air defense systems, long-range artillery, armored vehicles, fighter aircraft, munitions, spare parts, and logistical resources. The West, including the United States, should prepare for a protracted war and long-term support to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this brief is divided into four sections. First, it provides an update on the war, including through an operational map of the battlefield. Second, it examines the role of military innovation. Third, it assesses Ukrainian military innovation. Fourth, it assesses the future implications of Ukrainian innovation and foreign assistance in a war of attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;war-of-attrition&quot;&gt;War of Attrition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has become a war of attrition. Ukraine and Russia have constructed trench systems and made heavy use of artillery. Russia has employed human-wave attacks against fixed Ukrainian positions, including frontal assaults that attempt to seize ground by sheer weight of numbers, rather than by superior positioning or effective combined arms employment. Neither side has gained much territory since Ukraine’s successful offensives in late 2022, even as casualty rates have increased. Both militaries have suffered significant damage to their weapons systems. For example, Russia lost approximately 50 percent of its modern T-72B3 and T-72B3M main battle tanks since the war began, along with roughly two-thirds of its T-80BV/U tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attritional nature of the fighting can also be seen in the overall disposition of Russian and Ukrainian forces, as illustrated in Figure 1. Both sides face one another along a front stretching for 500 to 600 miles. Rather than massing armored formations at decisive points, both sides have distributed infantry across the front lines, with artillery in support. Although the nature of the fighting could still change, most signs point to a prolonged war of attrition in eastern and southern Ukraine, including the Russian military’s failure in February 2023 to achieve a rapid armored breakthrough near the southern town of Vuhledar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A war of attrition is one in which the belligerents attempt to wear each other down through piecemeal destruction of matériel and personnel. The essence of an attrition strategy is best described by Clausewitz, who wrote that it is a mistake to believe that there is “a skillful method of disarming and overcoming an enemy without causing great bloodshed.” Instead, Clausewitz contends that “war is an act of violence pushed to its utmost bounds” and that the side “that uses force unsparingly, without reference to the bloodshed involved, must obtain a superiority if his adversary uses less vigor in its application.” In attrition warfare, the belligerents are mainly concerned with overpowering their adversaries in a series of bloody set-piece battles that minimize exposure to enemy fire. These battles are characterized by high casualties, huge expenditures of matériel, and minimal movement of front lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In attrition warfare, a successful offensive operation pushes the defender backward along a front line, much like a bulldozer. There is limited expectation of delivering a knockout blow in which a specific action quickly renders the opponent unable to fight. The victorious side is instead the one that can more readily replace the soldiers and equipment — including long-range artillery and armored vehicles — that are lost in huge numbers. Even in cases when it is ultimately successful, attrition warfare carries huge costs. To win a war of attrition requires a willingness to absorb considerable casualties and significant losses of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of the war in Ukraine can be most clearly seen in the fighting for Bakhmut, a small city in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. For months, Russian forces have relentlessly shelled the city, fought house to house, and used human-wave attacks to overwhelm Ukrainian defenders. Spearheaded in recent months by the Russian private military company Wagner Group, Russian efforts to take Bakhmut have included recruiting vast numbers of prisoners from around the country to throw at the front lines — in addition to the use of regular Russian soldiers. The Russian military has utilized three waves of fighters in some areas: a first line of contractors and green conscripts, whose casualty rates are often high; a second line of replacements; and a third line of relatively competent Russian forces. Russia is accepting enormous casualties in return for only small amounts of territory. Despite intense fighting throughout the winter, Russia has only captured approximately 400 square miles of Ukrainian territory across the entire eastern front since September 2022. As Figures 3.1 and 3.2 show, there are numerous signs of attrition warfare, including defensive infantry trench systems, anti-tank ditches and berms, and impact craters from artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ytv49W1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the fighting today has devolved into a war of attrition, Russia appears to have initially employed a blitzkrieg strategy intended to win the war quickly. In February 2022, Russia concentrated ground forces at multiple points along Ukraine’s borders and attempted to pierce the front lines, race deep into Ukraine’s rear areas with the aid of air and naval power, and overthrow the government of Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Unlike a war of attrition, a blitzkrieg strategy relies on fast-moving armored and mechanized units to penetrate into the adversary’s weakly defended rear to destroy the informational, logistical, and political infrastructure on which an army depends. Russia likely based its strategy on several faulty assumptions, including that the Ukrainian population would not fight for a Zelenskyy government the Russians accused of being deeply corrupt, the Ukrainian military would be quickly overwhelmed, and the West would not support Ukraine and risk another “forever war” less than a year after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia controlled approximately 7 percent of Ukrainian territory. Within a month of the invasion, Russia controlled nearly 30 percent of Ukrainian territory, including large swaths of eastern Ukraine stretching from the southern Kherson Oblast to the northern Kharkiv Oblast, as well as a sizable chunk of territory reaching from Ukraine’s northern border to outside the capital of Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian advance soon stalled, however, and Ukrainian counteroffensives in the spring of 2022 repelled Russian forces from north of Kyiv and retook territory across much of the eastern front line, reducing total Russian territorial control to approximately 20 percent. A second wave of successful Ukrainian counteroffensives liberated more territory on the Kharkiv and Kherson fronts in the late summer and fall of 2022, reducing Russian control to approximately 17 percent, where it remains today. Figure 4 illustrates liberated areas of Ukraine (in blue) between March 2022 and February 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wLEP0fU.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of the war to one of attrition poses significant military and political challenges for Russia, especially since the Russian military is absorbing fatalities and casualties at rates it has not experienced since World War II. Estimating fatality and casualty numbers is notoriously difficult, in part because all sides have incentives to misrepresent such figures and in part because of the difficulties inherent in collecting data during active combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to CSIS estimates, there have been approximately 60,000 to 70,000 Russian combat fatalities in Ukraine between February 2022 and February 2023. These estimates include regular Russian soldiers from the Russian armed forces, Rosgvardiya, Federal Security Service, and Federal Guard Service; fighters from pro-Russian militias, such as the Donetsk People’s Militia and Luhansk People’s Militia; and contractors from such private military companies as the Wagner Group. Overall, Russia has suffered roughly 200,000 to 250,000 total casualties — personnel wounded, killed, and missing — during the first year of the war. These casualty estimates also include regular Russian soldiers, militia fighters, and private contractors from the Wagner Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some types of authoritarian regimes are willing to accept high casualties in interstate conflicts, but Russian casualty numbers are unprecedented for post-World War II Russia. As highlighted in Table 1, the number of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine during the first year of the war was likely greater than the entire number of Russian soldiers killed in every war Russia has fought since World War II combined. The number of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine in the first year was roughly two to five times greater than the number of Russian soldiers killed in Chechnya over nearly a decade a half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rate of attrition is also much higher in Ukraine than in any Soviet or Russian war since World War II. Russia suffered an average of roughly 5,000 to 5,800 regular and irregular soldiers killed per month in Ukraine over the first year of the war. In comparison, Russia suffered somewhere between 13,000 to 25,000 fatalities in Chechnya over a 15-year period (with a three-year pause), an average rate of between 95 and 185 soldiers killed per month. The Soviet Union also suffered roughly 14,000 to 16,000 combat fatalities in Afghanistan, an average rate of between roughly 130 and 145 soldiers killed per month. Vladimir Putin has thus far been willing to accept large numbers of Russian fatalities and casualties and has suffered limited political repercussions. But it is unclear that he will be able to do so forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wH1K3Gs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Russian Forces Killed in Selected Wars Since World War II.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ compilation. See endnote 29 for complete list of citations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russian fatalities in Ukraine pale in comparison to the Soviet death rate in World War II, the political context is extremely different. The Soviet Union suffered between 8 and 11 million military fatalities and another 14 million civilian fatalities following Germany’s invasion in 1941. However, the Soviets were the defenders at the start of the war and were, therefore, fighting a war of survival. Such casualties were a necessary cost of national existence. But Russia is currently the aggressor in Ukraine, where it is engaged in a war of choice against a country that poses no meaningful threat to Russia’s survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia invaded Ukraine from an apparent position of strength, countries with a significant material advantage — a larger population, a larger or more industrialized economy, a larger military, and greater military expenditures — are not guaranteed victory in war. Russia lost to Japan during the 1904–1905 Russo-Japanese War, despite having more naval ships, guns, and people. Israel repeatedly defeated its Arab foes in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, 1967 Six Day War, and 1973 Yom Kippur War. The limits of material preponderance are true even of wars of attrition. As one study concludes, “the cost of an attrition strategy is always high” and “success is relatively uncertain.” As some analysts have noted, wars of attrition may actually favor the weaker side, including if weaker militaries can find ways to fight more innovatively than their stronger enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-innovation&quot;&gt;Military Innovation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several factors help explain battlefield performance in conventional wars. They include a combination of the military balance (especially the quantity and quality of troops and weapons on both sides), strategy, tactics, morale, combat motivation (what some have called the “will to fight”), force employment, and political and military leadership. Military outcomes are generally not easy to predict, despite Napoleon’s comment that “God is on the side of the big battalions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military innovation is likely one important factor in determining battlefield success. As used here, military innovation involves a change in the conduct of warfare intended to improve the ability of a military to generate combat power. A change in the conduct of warfare does not necessarily require a change in military doctrine, but it does involve change at the operational level of war. Change could occur throughout the entire military, or it could be a narrower segment, such as a military service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet military innovation is difficult to achieve. Over 400 years ago, Machiavelli wrote: “And it should be considered that nothing is more difficult to handle, more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to manage, than to put oneself at the head of introducing new orders.” Innovation can occur during peacetime when leaders — especially military leaders — respond to changes in the international landscape and create environments that facilitate and encourage junior officers to pursue innovations and new ways of war. But it is impossible to predict the future with certainty, and militaries face incentives to avoid change or hedge between alternate futures rather than commit fully to an innovation that has not been proven in combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wartime allows for testing innovations against a real adversary but comes with its own obstacles. Militaries must balance the incentive to innovate against the daily need to defeat an enemy who is trying to kill their members and destroy their organizations. There is often insufficient time to assess wartime conditions, reformulate strategic conceptions, and build new forces before the outcome of a war is largely determined. Old and new methods can be tested in combat, but time constraints and limited intelligence make it difficult to take advantage of any apparent innovations in time to win the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, military innovation does occur during wartime, especially when operational control is decentralized, as was the case with the U.S. Navy submarine force during World War II. Innovation does not necessarily require substantial resources; major innovations have occurred during periods of constrained resources at least as often as during periods in which budgets were large and growing. Key resources for innovation are talented military personnel, time, and information — not money. Junior officers may be particularly important. Several important wartime innovations (such as the tank and microwave radar) and organizational innovations (such as strategic targeting for U.S. bombers) were pursued from the bottom up by junior officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ukrainian-innovation&quot;&gt;Ukrainian Innovation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military innovation is one factor that likely explains how Ukraine has overcome its disadvantages, though it is clearly not the only factor. The Ukrainian “will to fight,” political and military leadership (including that of President Zelenskyy), strategy, and force employment have all likely mattered, as has military, economic, and diplomatic support from the West. But innovation increases the ability of a weaker military to reverse the gains of a stronger one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also reason to believe that innovation may grow even more important as the war grinds on. Ukraine can win a war of attrition if it can impose greater losses on Russia than it suffers in any given engagement. Although continued Western aid, clever strategy, and sound force employment will contribute to such an outcome, new ways of fighting that improve the efficiency of Ukrainian forces will also be important for winning a long war of attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example of Ukrainian innovation has been the use of UASs in combined arms warfare — the blending of infantry, direct and indirect fire, aviation, and other joint capabilities to achieve political and military objectives. Ukraine is hardly the first country to use UASs in conventional warfare, but its employment of a wide variety of UASs in a large number of missions and its integration of UASs into more sophisticated targeting complexes have differed significantly from what came before — particularly Azerbaijan’s use of UASs against Armenia in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has operated several types of UASs in combined arms warfare. One has been the Bayraktar TB-2, a medium-altitude, long-endurance UAS, which was extensively used in the early phase of the war. The TB-2 can perform a range of intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and attack missions. Ukraine has operated small A1-SM Furia flying-wing UASs for day and night reconnaissance, hand-launched Leleka-100 and Spectator-M mini-UASs for artillery spotting and aerial reconnaissance, the UA Dynamics-made Punisher UAS for striking military targets, and larger PD-1s and UJ-22s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian forces have also utilized off-the-shelf commercial UASs, such as the DJI Mavic quadcopter. Mavics have been particularly useful for battlefield intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance for frontline forces. In addition, the United States has provided Ukraine with several loitering munitions — UASs intended to locate and destroy a target by detonating against it — such as the tube-launched Switchblade 300 and the long-endurance tactical Phoenix Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has utilized these UASs to conduct several types of missions as part of combined arms warfare, such as target identification for artillery and aircraft, strike, battlefield awareness, and information operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target Identification: Ukraine has used UASs to identify targets for artillery and aircraft. For example, Ukrainian ground forces have used forward-deployed UASs to detect Russian infantry units. This information is then distributed to command-and-control centers, who then pass it on to Ukrainian units operating 122-mm howitzers and other systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strike: Ukraine has utilized UASs for strike missions, including against land, air, and maritime targets. Ukrainian Bayraktar TB-2 drones have struck numerous Russian targets, such as howitzers, main battle tanks, supply trucks, towed artillery, maritime vessels, command posts, logistics depots, and Buk, Tor, Strela, and ZU-23 air defense systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Battlefield Awareness: Ukraine has used UASs for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions to monitor Russian activity and facilitate battlefield awareness. The sensors on some Ukrainian UAS platforms can collect signals intelligence, record video, and collect other information for operational use by ground and air forces. These capabilities have also allowed UASs to be useful for battle damage assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Information Operations: Ukraine has utilized UASs for information operations, such as showing successful strikes and placing them — overtly or covertly — on social media platforms such as Twitter, Telegram, and TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Ukrainian forces have utilized software packages that are often developed and deployed by volunteers. The most well-known of these applications is Kropyva, an intelligence mapping and artillery software populated by information from UASs and other sources. Forward-deployed tactical units have downloaded the software and continuously updated it on handheld tablets and computers. Kropyva allows Ukrainian units to plot both enemy and friendly positions. It uses short-wave and digital radio stations compatible with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s security communications standards and is relatively easy to use. Other home-grown software solutions include GIS Arta, ComBat Vision, and the recently deployed Delta situational awareness and battlefield management system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TNKk0oL.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Kropyva Defense Mapping Software.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Army SOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has also leveraged Starlink to integrate some of its systems, another tactical innovation that has allowed Ukraine to overcome Russian jamming. Starlink is a commercially owned satellite internet constellation developed by SpaceX to provide high-speed, low-latency broadband internet using advanced satellites in low earth orbit. Starlink has enabled members of the Ukrainian organization Aerorozvidka, for instance, to carry out intelligence collection and fire support operations against Russian positions. Some Ukrainian UASs rely on Starlink against forward-deployed Russian forces, and Ukrainian forces and civilians use Starlink to communicate using encrypted satellite communications. Overall, Starlink has helped blunt Russia’s attempts to jam signals, block the internet, and undermine Ukrainian command-and-control capabilities. In addition, some Ukrainian troops have strapped Starlink user terminals to drones involved in strike operations, allowing the craft to be steered with the help of the internet connection provided by satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Ukrainian military innovations include placing Harpoon anti-ship missiles on flatbed trucks for ground-based, stand-off attack; mounting grenades and other improvised explosive devices on UASs, including Mavics; utilizing “swarming” tactics with multiple UASs; and using 3D printers to build plastic harnesses with light sensors and a mechanical clasp that snap onto UASs and carry grenades. Overall, Ukraine has used its military innovations to help defend against Russian advances, conduct counterattacks in eastern and southern Ukraine, and improve overall battlefield performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But obstacles to innovation remain. According to CSIS interviews, the lack of official Ukrainian government support discourages adoption of volunteer-made systems, which prevents the military from scaling their use across the force. Some officers fear the consequences of using a system they lack official permission to use. Others lack the communications hardware required to take advantage of potentially valuable software. The use of commercial quadcopters is also hampered by the makers’ efforts to prevent users from integrating them into military systems, which involve firmware changes between models and increasingly restrictive application programming interfaces. The absence of government funding also means that platform usage is constrained by developers’ ability to raise funds from individual donors. Ukraine has begun taking positive steps to enable the innovation already happening in the country by officially sanctioning the use of the Delta management defense system on the battlefield, but a more comprehensive and systematic approach would be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukraine attempts to maintain its innovation advantage, it should avoid apparent innovations that decrease combat power or forestall victory. Innovation is an inherently risky process. Some research suggests that the innovation process goes wrong when a military cannibalizes an old capability to create a new one, ignores the risks associated with a particular innovation, or rushes the vetting process in order to speed deployment. Innovation can also fail if it contributes to a flawed theory of victory. Ignoring the risks of innovation and rushing through the vetting process are real risks — and the current informality of Ukrainian innovation could exacerbate them. Volunteer developers are unlikely to have the necessary capacity to evaluate all the risks because they lack access to classified data and specific analytic expertise held by military or intelligence bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-implications&quot;&gt;Future Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine is far from over. Ukraine’s achievements on the battlefield have been the result of several factors, including Russian failures and Ukrainian successes. Military innovation has been — and will remain — important. But the Ukrainian military should formalize the current system of domestic innovation and create structures and organizational processes to monitor its successes and failures. To maximize the power of these innovations, Ukraine should give units the permissions necessary to formally adopt the tools they are already using. The military should also consider creating an analysis center to evaluate the impacts of bottom-up innovations on combat performance and other measures of success. With that data and analysis in hand, the Ukrainian military can then make better-informed decisions on which innovations to scale up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign partners should also consider providing financial support to this infrastructure or the innovators themselves, who currently depend mostly on crowdfunding. Increased funding would empower Ukrainian innovators who are currently constrained by the need to support themselves while donating their time and expertise. Funding would also provide another way for governments to provide “nonlethal” aid to Ukraine if forced to do so by domestic political constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the war of attrition continues, however, it is unlikely that military innovation will be sufficient to outweigh the matériel needs of the Ukrainian military. The West, including the United States, should prepare for a protracted war and long-term support. Ukraine’s needs have evolved from the initial stage of the war when it needed short-range defensive weapons, such as Javelin anti-tank and Stinger anti-air missiles, which were helpful to conduct defensive operations against advancing Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with training and intelligence, Ukraine now needs advanced systems to conduct offensive operations in a protracted war, such as air defense systems, long-range artillery, armored vehicles, fighter aircraft, and munitions, along with spare parts and training. These types of munitions, weapons systems, and matériel are essential to assisting Ukrainian forces conduct effective counterattacks against dug-in Russian forces. Figure 6 shows the impact craters from artillery in yet another example of attrition warfare. Even defenders in a war of attrition need to pursue operational offensives to wear down the enemy, reduce pressure on vulnerable areas, and satisfy political audiences at home and abroad to continue support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3643Ysg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Artillery Impact Craters near Pavlivka, Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, wars of attrition are insatiable consumers of munitions, and their heavy use takes a toll on weapons systems and platforms. On some days the Russian military has launched 50,000 artillery shells at Ukrainian military and civilian positions. Supporting Ukraine through a prolonged war of attrition means supplying them with the munitions the Ukrainian military needs. Ukraine has a strong track record of innovating and integrating Western weapons systems into its military operations over the first year of the war. It should be able to effectively integrate new weapons systems into its arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, more Patriot surface-to-air missile systems would be useful. So would MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), which are surface-to-air missiles that can be fired from a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), which Ukraine already possesses. ATACMS can be fired three times the distance of standard rockets, allowing Ukrainian ground forces to move farther away from Russia’s deadly long-range artillery. Tanks and infantry fighting vehicles are essential to providing fire support and carrying infantry into battle. Abrams, Challenger 2, and Leopard 2 tanks will be helpful, along with AMX-10 RC armored fighting vehicles. But continuing support for these vehicles — including spare parts, munitions, and trainers — will also be critical. MQ-1C drones would provide helpful intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and strike capabilities to Ukrainian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Ukraine’s Soviet-era air force needs more, better aircraft to outcompete Russia in a war of attrition. Combat losses in the past five months have cost it over 50 combat aircraft out of an original fleet of approximately 124 combat aircraft. With fewer aircraft available, each plane endures more sorties and wears down faster. Without replenishment from the West, Ukraine could lose the ability to defend its airspace and target Russian ground forces, potentially allowing Russia to resume its blitzkrieg. The U.S. Air Force is divesting more than 200 A-10s, F-15s, and F-16s to make room for sixth-generation fighters, hypersonic weapons, and other systems. Ukraine could use some of these aircraft — along with trainers and spare parts — particularly for close air support missions to aid Ukrainian ground forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine needs munitions, weapons systems, logistics, training, and intelligence at the appropriate scale. Russia still has an advantage over Ukraine in the number of munitions and the quality of some weapons systems — such as long-range artillery, advanced fixed-wing aircraft, and naval capabilities — though Ukrainian military innovation has been impressive. U.S. and other Western military aid to date has been helpful, though sometimes too slow. Moving forward, the U.S. and Western defense industrial bases will be essential for a long, grinding war of attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方就「共謀者原則」交25頁證據列表 公民黨抗爭派記者會等均用以指證所有被告&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XtmBULM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（27日）踏入審訊第16天。控方今表示已完成區諾軒的主問，並向辯方呈交「共謀者原則」下針對各被告的25頁證據列表，列出會依賴的文章、帖文及影片等。控方確認，本案協議於2020年2月中已由戴耀廷和區諾軒二人達成，而列表上的所有證據均用以指證所有被告，即使他們當時未加入串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有辯方律師質疑，列表範圍廣闊，包括公民黨和抗爭派記者會片段、社民連網站、甚至個別被告FB帖文，問是否全用以指證所有被告，控方確認。法官李運騰指，控方立場是否合理有待辯論，並預料本案將牽涉兩方面法律爭議，包括「共謀者原則」是否適用於當時尚未變成違法的協議（《國安法》於2020年6月30日才生效）、及當時尚未參與其中的被告。法官陳慶偉批准將案件押後至周三（3月1日）續審，以讓辯方審視文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方完成主問-今交共謀者原則證據列表&quot;&gt;控方完成主問 今交「共謀者原則」證據列表&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方上周五表示主問大致完成，並會於今天交代如何援引「共謀者原則（co-conspirator’s rule）」舉證，即依賴其他被告的什麼言行指證其他被告。主控萬德豪今甫開庭表示，沒有其他問題要問區諾軒，亦已向辯方呈交「共謀者原則」下針對各被告證據的列表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問及，列表上是否只限於區諾軒的證供，抑或是控方依賴的全部證據。萬德豪回應是本案依賴的全部證據，即包括還未向區諾軒展示的證據。法官陳仲衡亦提及，該列表只列出文章、Facebook 帖文、影片及影片謄本等文件證據，問會否包括區諾軒庭上口供，萬指會待區完成作供後再說明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱協議於2020年2月由戴區二人達成-所有證據均用以指證所有被告&quot;&gt;控方稱協議於2020年2月由戴區二人達成 所有證據均用以指證所有被告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指出，列表第一篇文章〈立法會奪半的最後拼圖，原來只需教中小企咁做！〉並未由區諾軒提過，控方同意。法官陳慶偉遂指，該文章於2020年2月15日發布，問控方是否認為協議在當天已達成？萬德豪同意，並指協議是由戴耀廷和區諾軒達成。陳慶偉遂問，除了戴區二人，該文章是否還用來指證任何人？萬德豪回應該文章是用來指證所有共謀者，即使他們當時還未加入串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰表示，控方的立場是否成立有待辯論，可留待控方案情完結時聽取雙方的陳詞。陳慶偉再問控方，其立場是否列表上所有證據均用來指證所有被告（“They are against all the defendants?”）？萬德豪指那是正確的，陳續指相信辯方亦需時消化他所澄清的內容。陳慶偉其後欲釐清列表上所有證據均由控方依賴時，一度未能找到適合字眼，萬德豪補充，控方是以所有證據來指證（implicate）所有被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱範圍廣闊需時審視及索指示-官批准押後至周三&quot;&gt;辯方稱範圍廣闊需時審視及索指示 官批准押後至周三&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷及黃碧雲的大律師沈士文其後表示，控方25頁的列表範圍一如他所預期的非常廣闊，又指雖並非現時作陳詞，但仍望提出觀察，顯然該列表的大部分證據，雖或可證明串謀或協議已存在，但不可能（no way）用以證明部分被告曾參與串謀。他望控方收窄證據範圍，指若範圍如此廣闊，辯方需就每項證據作出爭辯，亦需時處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰表示明白辯方關注，但現時並非處理該議題的適當時候。沈士文回應，辯方需時審視及就有關文件索取指示，以及準備對區諾軒的盤問，望押後至周三續審。大律師 Trevor Beel 等均表示同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉認為，給予辯方時間審視該冗長的文件（lengthy documents）是公平的做法，批准押後至周三早上，屆時可先處理承認事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官提法律議題-包括達成協議時未違法被告未加入串謀-原則是否適用&quot;&gt;官提法律議題 包括達成協議時未違法、被告未加入串謀 原則是否適用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑其後再問，是否稍後才處理共謀者原則是否適用的問題。法官李運騰同意，指援引該原則其中一項要求，是被告作為共謀者的表面證供成立，故須待控方舉證完畢才能決定。法官陳慶偉亦指本案有4名被告任控方證人，現時僅區諾軒完成主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑再欲澄清，是否即文件上所有證據均會用以援引「共謀者原則」，法官同意，陳慶偉並重申據控方立場，該「串謀（conspiracy）」於2月15日已達成。陳世傑一度更正當時並未成為「串謀」，陳慶偉回應他只是廣義地使用該字，稱「串謀」不一定指「刑事串謀（criminal conspiracy）」，亦可指「協議（agreement）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰其後主動指出，預料本案有一些法律爭議需處理，包括若該協議達成時尚未變成違法，「共謀者原則」是否適用（“… whether the rule can apply to an agreement which is yet to be unlawful at that time.”）；以及若被告當時尚未參與其中，「共謀者原則」又是否適用（“… whether the rule can apply to defendant at that stage yet to be a party.”）。李運騰早前審訊已曾指出，此前的初選「計劃（scheme）」或者並不違法，不過在《國安法》實施後，原本合法的行為也可變成非法，該「計劃」便成了非法的「串謀（conspiracy）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問公民黨記者會是否用以指證非公民黨被告-控方yes&quot;&gt;辯方問公民黨記者會是否用以指證非公民黨被告 控方：Yes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉則舉例，列表中列出公民黨和抗爭派記者會片段、社民連網站截圖，甚至個別被告如鄭達鴻的 Facebook 帖文，惟其當事人不屬公民黨和社民連，望控方澄清是否指上述證據，包括個別被告的發言，都可全用來指證其當事人。法官陳慶偉着馬維騉直接與控方商討，指法庭只處理雙方申請，而非雙方之間的爭拗。馬維騉一度指法庭可當成是他的申請，惟陳慶偉再着他與控方商討，又提醒馬只是代表其當事人一個的利益。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1DGsK0J.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 陳志全&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪則回覆，「答案非常簡單，只有一個字，Yes」，指該些證據均用來指證所有被告，包括陳志全。法官陳慶偉重申，該立場是否正確有待處理，但那是控方的立場。法官李運騰再問，控方是否即指公民黨的發言是指證所有被告參與串謀的證據，萬德豪確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Beel 最後提出，並未承認戴耀廷的相關文章，認為控方需正式地提出（formally produce）該些證據，即交由下載文章的人就此作供，而非交由僅看過文章的區諾軒確認。他在法官詢問下同意，欲爭議就戴耀廷文章的證物鏈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件周三（3月1日）續審。散庭時，有旁聽人士喊：「加油！」梁國雄等亦向旁聽席揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">控方就「共謀者原則」交25頁證據列表 公民黨抗爭派記者會等均用以指證所有被告</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Ukraine War, One Year On</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-24-ukraine-war-one-year-on.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ukraine War, One Year On" /><published>2023-02-24T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-02-24T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/ukraine-war-one-year-on</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-24-ukraine-war-one-year-on.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russia’s assumption that Ukraine would fall quickly has led to an intense and protracted war.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russia assumed that Ukrainian political opposition would be minimal, and that the ‘decapitation’ of the Ukrainian government would lead to a collapse of resistance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This did not go to plan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2021, satellite imagery documented the massive concentration of Russian forces amassing on the border. Ukraine, for its part, was uncertain whether the build-up was a prelude to an invasion, and there was debate over whether it was an attempt to sow panic in Ukraine or if Russia was preparing for a more limited offensive to take Donbas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OabCwyb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 24 February 2022, the Russian army invaded on four axes. From the north, Russian troops invaded via Belarus and on an axis from Sumy to Chernihiv. In the south, the 58th Combined Arms Army pushed out of Crimea. Finally, Russian forces and proxies conducted operations in Donbas to pin down the bulk of Ukraine’s regular units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hD2OIhk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;invasion&quot;&gt;Invasion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LsFYFyO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to split a relatively small force on four axes only made sense in the context of an assumed political collapse. Against many predictions, this failed to materialise, and Russian forces failed to take Kyiv. Unprepared for a longer conflict, with many soldiers receiving little to no forewarning or even being provided with adequate maps, the Russians became bogged down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;donbas-offensive&quot;&gt;Donbas Offensive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gVLAHet.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having failed to take Kyiv, Russia shifted its focus to a more limited campaign to seize Donbas and make further gains in the south of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian approach was more deliberate here, and drew on the Russian army’s advantages in both artillery and capabilities such as electronic warfare (EW) complexes. At the peak of the campaign, Russia was firing 32,000 artillery rounds per day in Donbas and had emplaced 10 EW complexes on each 20 km stretch of the front. This combination of fire and information superiority allowed the Russians to inflict heavy attrition on the Ukrainians, and to take cities like Lyman, Popasna and Severodonetsk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the south, despite a protracted resistance, Russian forces succeeded in taking Mariupol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their advantages, Russian forces sustained heavy casualties storming Ukrainian defences in areas of the country that had been steadily fortified after 2014. This was especially true of rebel troops from Luhansk and Donetsk, who were used as expendable cannon fodder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrival of the HIMARS and its 70 km-range M31 rocket, as well as the M270 MLRS system, altered this dynamic by allowing the Ukrainian defenders to target the ammunition depots and railheads on which Russia depended to sustain its rate of fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;counteroffensive&quot;&gt;Counteroffensive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ewKqeNf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By September 2022, Russia was at the nadir of its power. The force with which it had invaded was largely exhausted, and Russia’s leaders were still reluctant to order mobilisation. As such, Russia was manning a frontline of over 1,000 km with a relatively small force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine began a series of shaping operations around Kherson in late 2022, which included striking key bridges like the Antonovsky Bridge. Anticipating an offensive, Russia shifted many of its best remaining units, including units of the Russian Airborne Forces, to Kherson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine instead took the offensive in the north, where a brigade-sized Ukrainian force punched through undermanned Russian defences around Kharkiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around Kherson, by contrast, Ukraine’s offensive was slower and more deliberate, and faced stubborn Russian resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sNbJ2hD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-state-of-play&quot;&gt;Military State of Play&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oJ6cTPM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under General Sergey Surovikin, Russia shifted to a defensive posture on the frontline, while conducting a strategic bombing campaign over the winter. Unlike other Russian actions, the withdrawal from Kherson was competently executed. A shift to the defensive and the introduction of mobilised forces to fill gaps on the frontline eased some of Russia’s problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was combined with an air campaign using cruise missiles and Iranian-made UAVs to target critical infrastructure, especially the energy grid. Ukraine faces a conundrum: it can protect its cities, but in doing so it expends air defence interceptors, often against replaceable targets like the Iranian Shahed-136. If interceptor stocks fall too low, the Russian air force can operate much more freely over Ukraine. Western systems such as the German-made Gepard self-propelled anti-air gun have helped alleviate this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the campaign will likely not remain defensive. Russia has mounted localised offensives around Bakhmut, relying on a combination of low-quality troops hired by the Wagner Group from Russia’s prison population, as well as more capable units both from Wagner and elements of the Russian army withdrawn from Kherson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/e0ehqlR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The replacement of Surovikin by Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s Chief of the General Staff, as well as the further mobilisation of conscripts, suggest a potential offensive. Though some conscripts were rushed to the frontline to fill gaps, others appear to have been formed into coherent units that have not yet been committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coming months could prove pivotal; a successful Russian offensive or further attrition of Ukraine’s forces could shift the balance. Equally, if a Russian offensive fails, it could lead to a cascading collapse of morale among poorly motivated troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YunawFb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Russia does stay on the defensive, however, Ukrainian forces equipped with Western armour will have to take the offensive against a more ‘primitive’ but larger and well-entrenched force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the medium term, Russia believes that the exhaustion of Western materiel and the erosion of both Ukraine’s manpower and its economic backbone will create the conditions for Russian success. If this window of vulnerability is crossed, the regeneration of Western (in particular, US) defence production and the cumulative effect of Russia’s own economic weaknesses could tilt the balance the other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stock-take&quot;&gt;STOCK TAKE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of the war on Ukraine’s population and critical infrastructure has been immense. Millions of people have been displaced, and Russia is constantly targeting energy infrastructure with drones. The economies of both countries have taken a significant hit as a result of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;internally-displaced-persons&quot;&gt;Internally Displaced Persons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NU3j8Cc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toll on Ukraine’s society has been huge. By December 2022, roughly 5,900,000 people were internally displaced within Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That number has recently been updated to 7.1 million by some sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total of 12–14 million Ukrainians have been displaced overall since the war began, according to UN figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;infrastructure&quot;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/i5bddJC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s air and missile campaign against Ukraine’s energy grid has focused on transformers and substations. Against large transformers, Russia uses cruise missiles like the 3M-14 Kalibr and ballistic missiles like the 9M723. Smaller substations and facilities housing personnel have been attacked with the Shahed-136.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, Ukraine’s electricity usage is at 75% of its peacetime levels, with rolling blackouts. However, the system is vulnerable to a rapid drop in functionality if multiple transformers go down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also targeted the facilities and personnel of the Ukrainian company ZTR, which produces transformers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though winter has almost passed, other risks remain – for example, the possibility of a failure of the energy grid cascading into other areas such as military communications, logistics or the management of dams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compatibility issues constrain the direct resupply of Ukraine, and personnel may prove even harder to replace than material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-position&quot;&gt;Economic Position&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VIwvN4b.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Russia and Ukraine have economic vulnerabilities, but these will become apparent at different stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing a crunch in hard currency due to Western sanctions and price caps, Russia can only sustain its war effort without undergoing crippling inflation by shifting budgetary allocations from civilian expenditure to military spending. Defence spending will now consume 33% of the federal budget. Even with the focus on reallocating resources, Russia has seen a rise in the federal budget from 23 trillion roubles to 29 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia will run a deficit for the first time in decades this year, and individual regional governments are also running deficits driven by mobilisation costs. As cuts to social spending cause a slowdown in consumption and mobilisation draws workers from the civilian economy, this problem will be compounded. Russia can no longer borrow on open financial markets, and is unlikely to be able to do so easily domestically. However, the country’s national wealth fund (which largely relies on revenue from hydrocarbon exports) is likely to sustain this deficit for a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with price caps, Russia’s oil revenues will exceed 2021 levels, although its revenues from gas exports will be harder to replace. Russia is adapting to the loss of revenue by raising taxes on mineral extraction for hydrocarbon companies as well as other extractive industries, which some expect to offset roughly 75% of lost revenue. Even so, the Russian state will still face a budget deficit, and higher taxes could drive capital flight if avenues for capital to leave Russia remain available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Ukraine faces a more immediately grim economic outlook, having lost 30% of its GDP due to the war (as opposed to the 3% contraction faced by Russia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to win, given its more immediately dire economic circumstances, Ukraine needs either a decisive military victory in short order, or the ability to sustain a war economy over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia can exacerbate Ukraine’s challenges both through air and missile attacks and by resuming its blockade of Odesa on the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Securing the Ukrainian economy for a long fight will require not only economic aid from Ukraine’s partners, but also the ability to secure physical infrastructure and sea lines of communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;projection&quot;&gt;PROJECTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;industrial-base&quot;&gt;INDUSTRIAL BASE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia maintained a large pre-war defence industrial base, employing 2 million people in its defence sector. Though rates of expenditure over the last year have strained its stockpiles of key capabilities, it likely retains the capacity to build munitions such as 152mm and 122mm shells at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increase in the defence sector’s share of the economic pie and contractions elsewhere in the economy could see the size of the Russian workforce grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are key bottlenecks in Russian defence manufacturing. First, the Russian defence sector is heavily reliant on imports of machine tools. Russia has mitigated the risks involved by increasing imports from China, but it still imported large quantities of machine tools from Germany before the war began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workforce in the 600 or so R&amp;amp;D organisations within the Russian defence industrial complex is a second bottleneck. A ‘lost generation’ of STEM-qualified employees in the post-Soviet era and a tendency for promising graduates to seek employment in other areas mean that this workforce is ageing. The flight of individuals from Russia over the last year will exacerbate this. However, this is a long-term problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Russia remains critically reliant on Western components for its more sophisticated platforms. It can offset the effects of sanctions through a variety of means, but at a cost to efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, in the short to medium term, Russia’s industrial base can generate capacity at scale, especially if the country shifts towards building large volumes of less sophisticated equipment to be manned by a mobilised force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s Western backers – particularly the US – are regenerating their own production capacity. This will likely take effect by 2025, but there is a risk of a capacity trough until this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine also retains a sizeable domestic defence industrial sector, which remains active despite Russian pressure. Challenges such as access to energy and manpower could be constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;timing&quot;&gt;TIMING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Russia and Ukraine will face windows of vulnerability. For Ukraine, this window will be in 2023, when its resources and, in particular, its economy will be heavily stretched. Launching offensives on defended Russian positions – even with Western armour – will prove difficult. However, if the Ukrainians can induce Russia to waste manpower in offensive actions during this period, and if the country’s backers can help sustain its economy, Russia will begin to face its own resource constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, given time, a more thorough effort to equip Ukrainian forces along Western lines can be sustained. If Ukraine can cross the immediate period of vulnerability it currently faces, its prospects will improve markedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-will&quot;&gt;POLITICAL WILL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both Ukraine and Russia, political will is likely to remain high. For Ukraine, this war is existential, and polling suggests that 70% of Ukrainians wish to continue fighting. For Russia, failure in Ukraine could lead to regime collapse, which historically has preceded periods of national chaos. As such, both Russia’s leadership and its population are likely to see the costs of war as being outweighed by the costs of defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public opinion in states backing Ukraine presents a more complex prospect. On the one hand, there has been little shift in support for Ukraine in the US and UK, despite the economic costs of the conflict. On the other hand, two major challenges persist. While publics may not blame the support provided to Ukraine for soaring food and energy prices, they nonetheless tend to blame incumbent leaders for economic hardship. Leaders such as US President Joe Biden face historically low approval ratings. This could, over time, provide an incentive to seek a settlement in the hope that an anticipated economic upturn could strengthen the position of Western leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, although publics are supportive of Ukraine, large segments of the population in states such as Italy and Germany view peace as more important than the restoration of Ukraine’s internationally recognised boundaries. While there is unlikely to be any significant movement to end support for Ukraine, the risk is that sections of the population and political class may argue for linking continued support with negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russia’s misguided assumption that Ukraine would fall quickly has led to an intense and protracted war.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A year after it began, there is still much uncertainty over what the final outcome of this conflict will be.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;柯耀林誤會播片毋須到庭遲到半小時 林卓廷：叫佢請食早餐啦！&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;官問何謂抗爭派 區諾軒以何桂藍為例指對方有左翼思想&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2u4MPQK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第15天。控方今早續播放2020年7月9日，戴耀廷與區諾軒等於初選前召開的記招片段，並讓區諾軒閱讀另外5個記者會的錄音謄本作確認。會上戴耀廷重申初選不違法，黃之鋒及朱凱廸亦籲港人投票，黃稱要「讓北京政權知道，香港仍然有好多人係唔選擇向呢一個共產政權卑躬屈膝」，朱亦指要「畀全世界睇到香港人喺《國安法》之後係唔會向北京嘅野蠻統治屈服」。此外，柯耀林今早因誤會播片時不用到庭而遲到半小時，到達後林卓廷打趣說：「叫佢請食早餐啦！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成問睇咗財政預算案未柯耀林遲到半小時&quot;&gt;鄒家成問「睇咗財政預算案未」柯耀林遲到半小時&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方昨午播放部分戴耀廷、區諾軒和趙家賢於2020年7月9日召開的記者會片段，今早播放餘下片段，其餘時間讓區諾軒閱讀其他記者會謄本確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告今早10時入庭，各被告神情輕鬆，鄒家成向旁聽席問：「睇咗財政預算案未？」，再笑說「支持」，林卓廷亦與黃碧雲交談，早前受傷的吳政亨則已拆除其三角手掛。林卓廷一度向面前的懲教用力眨眼和活動眼球，提及「最近睇緊本書，所有靈長類都冇眼眉，係得人有眼眉，點解呢？」，黃碧雲作回應後，林稱「以前係咁講，後尾發覺唔係」，並解釋眼眉和眼白是表達情感和溝通的工具。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;直至10時許，柯耀林尚未到庭，有懲教表示「爭一個」，被告欄有人提到：「今朝打畀佢，仲喺屋企」，有被告發笑，後亦有法庭職員表示：「未齊人，仲有一個未到，所以未開得庭。」林卓廷打趣說：「阿柯要請你哋食飯喎」，其後各還柙被告被帶返囚室，鄒家成一度稱：「我想留喺度喎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至10時34分，身穿棒球褸和裇衫、微喘的柯耀林小跑着推開法庭大門，有被告說「柯耀林到啦！」，還柙被告亦即被帶返法庭，林卓廷對保釋被告說：「叫佢請食早餐啦！」鄒家成亦附和：「請食早餐喎！」案件終於10時40分開庭，代表柯耀林的大律師表示柯誤會了今早播片時毋須到庭，已向柯講解法庭的安排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;朱凱廸籲港人勇敢投票用文明暴露共產黨野蠻&quot;&gt;朱凱廸籲港人勇敢投票：用文明暴露共產黨野蠻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後續播放記者會片段，黃之鋒、朱凱廸等輪流發言。區諾軒不時轉身望向被告欄上方的大屏幕及旁聽席，一時托腮，一時雙手交叉握拳，一時翹起雙手。在會上，黃之鋒形容「初選係《國安法》立法之後第一次公民表態嘅機會」，籲所有港人出來投票，「讓國際社會知道香港人未投降，亦讓北京政權知道，香港仍然有好多人係唔選擇向呢一個共產政權卑躬屈膝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wkWGhCD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黃之鋒（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;朱凱廸則提及：「大家都知道凡係共產黨要極力阻止喺香港發生嘅事，我哋就要更加令到佢搞得成功」，又指現時政府與共產黨的立場已經顯明，「初選就係一個非常之關鍵重要嘅一個過程⋯⋯畀全世界睇到香港人喺《國安法》之後係唔會向北京嘅野蠻統治屈服嘅」，籲「香港人勇敢出嚟投票，我哋用文明去暴露共產黨嘅野蠻」。朱凱廸發言前，主控周天行指朱早前未有出現，區確認朱的身份。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ew2VnKB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷重申初選不違法-若當局任意解讀大家都識得判斷香港法治狀況&quot;&gt;戴耀廷重申初選不違法 若當局任意解讀「大家都識得判斷香港法治狀況」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷重申，否決財政預算案是《基本法》賦予的權力，「呢個應該係一個常識嚟⋯⋯我諗每一個人都會知道立法會行使權力本身就係一個合法嘅行為，我又見唔到有任何嘅非法元素喺裡面。」但他亦指，知道《國安法》並非普通法，用普通法原則解讀雖沒理由違法，但若當局「鍾意任意去解讀呢個《國安法》，連一個公民一齊出嚟投票嘅行動都可以定為非法、甚至為嚴重違法嘅話，咁我諗香港就即係個法治係點樣狀況，大家都識得判斷㗎啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷又指，看不到初選會突然出現腰斬，亦會要求票站遵守限聚令要求。趙家賢亦強調，民主動力和香港民研舉辦初選計劃，「係一定要全部係合法嘅，我哋先至會去做，呢個係絕對清楚，我哋會做足所有措施去確保符合返香港現有或者新加嘅法例。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到DQ風險，區諾軒指「相信我哋個個都冇水晶球，因為真係唔知佢開邊路」。他自言不會十分樂觀，「而家基本上係佢哋想做乜就做乜」，但指認為初選合法，沒有問及警方部署，「都希望佢哋唔好去干預一啲合法嘅事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒留法庭讀謄本-吳政亨與女友交流何桂藍在電腦打字&quot;&gt;區諾軒留法庭讀謄本 吳政亨與女友交流、何桂藍在電腦打字&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;播畢片段後，區諾軒確認當中情況與他出席時一致。控方其後讓區諾軒閱讀2020年6月9日、7月6日、7月11至13日5個記者會的錄音謄本，法官陳慶偉着區閱讀謄本確認與他的理解是否一致。陳慶偉續指法官將離席，留下法庭書記在場，至於律師、被告及公眾可以按其意願留下，但特別提醒勿騷擾區閱讀謄本，否則會要求該人立即離開法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3名法官於約11時10分離去，眾被告亦陸續離開。余慧明一度留下與律師溝通，其後亦離去，剩下吳政亨一人被帶到被告欄最盡處的角落，被兩名懲教看守。區諾軒則留在原位獨自翻閱兩個大文件夾的錄音謄本，期間3名懲教人員站在他後面看守，區不時抬頭望向被告欄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在區諾軒閱讀謄本期間，吳政亨全程與旁聽席的女友以手勢交流。何桂藍於約11時半亦從囚室步回法庭，向旁聽席張望後，便默默在用來摘錄筆記的電腦打字，時而若有所思。旁聽席則尚有十數名人士留下，部分人閉目睡覺。區諾軒於12時53分表示「我睇完啦」，並獲懲教帶離法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/URk0BsZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第15天。法官李運騰今問及區諾軒口中「抗爭派」的意思，區形容他們在民主派系中站在「較進步」的位置，指「佢哋都好多元」。區又以不認罪被告為例，指鄒家成、余慧明和何桂藍3人為抗爭派，並形容何桂藍「係一個較為有左翼思想嘅人」，引起何桂藍等多名被告大笑，區一度向被告欄笑着問「準唔準確呀？我好驚我標籤錯人呀」，被法官提醒是問區的理解，不是被告的理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，主控周天行今展示截圖要求區諾軒認出何桂藍，惟屢被法官質疑區不在場、回應欠證據價值，且控方提問方式不恰當，有如「在律師席上作證」。區已作供10日，控方指主問已大致完結，確認下周一會說明「共謀者原則」下針對各被告的證據，並在法官提問下釐清所有被告於2020年7月1日均已加入串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區問為何僅衞生服務及超區參與初選-官法庭真的需要知道嗎&quot;&gt;區問為何僅衞生服務及超區參與初選 官：法庭真的需要知道嗎？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方下午問及初選投票情況，區諾軒供稱，在7月11至12日的投票日，全港共設200多個票站，每個地方選區約佔50至60個，而除5個地方選區，功能組別只包括超級區議會和衞生服務界。控方問及原因，區解釋曾有其他功能組別想過是否搞初選，但最終只接納衞生服務界參與；至於超區則因過往都由直選產生，故亦在初選計劃內。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續請區再解釋背後原因，但法官陳慶偉兩度問：「法庭真的需要知道嗎？（“Do we really need to know?”）」周起初說是，其後猶豫片刻，指這解釋了初選計劃的部分結構。法官李運騰問這如何幫助控方證明控罪，法官陳仲衡亦指該議題與受審被告無關，亦與法庭無關。周指他只是提供背景，將會問到相關議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區主辦單位整體負責超區戴耀廷聯絡衞生服務界&quot;&gt;區：主辦單位整體負責超區、戴耀廷聯絡衞生服務界&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後問及誰負責跟進超區事宜。區解釋，就初選投票安排，組織者一直將超區與其他地方選區一併考慮，而超區協調會是「由我哋主辦單位整體去負責嘅」，包括他、戴耀廷及代表民主動力的趙家賢。他又指，他與戴耀廷均有出席超區協調會議，趙家賢則「應該冇」，至於衞生服務界則一直由戴聯絡相關人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問如何理解抗爭派-區稱在民主派系企喺一個較進步嘅位置&quot;&gt;官問如何理解「抗爭派」 區稱在民主派系「企喺一個較進步嘅位置」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後向區展示一段片段，惟法官陳仲衡即指：「作為說故事的人（storyteller），我期望你告訴我們將要展示什麼。」法官李運騰亦指，控方在展示任何證物前，應先確立基礎，先就事件發問以看證人有否相關印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續問，區諾軒曾否與何桂藍親身見面（何的律師早前曾表示爭議片中身分），區稱他們曾於7月在香港島一同出席宣傳初選投票的競選活動。周問競選活動與誰有關，區答「好似係有啲抗爭派嘅人選」，鄒家成發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時法官李運騰表示，區曾數度提及「抗爭派」，但沒有印象解釋過意思，問區「抗爭派」與「傳統民主派」的分別。區表示，「一個較好嘅歸類事件」，是初選投票日後的一個記者會，會上「參加者都係標籤自己係抗爭派」。延伸庭有被告聞言竊笑，梁晃維亦對着袁嘉蔚「戚眉」及露出笑容。控方問區如何理解此標籤，區解釋：「民主派當時嘅派系分類裡面，佢哋（抗爭派）係企得喺一個較進步嘅位置。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZcJZ3gE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年7月15日 抗爭派記者會（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，「進步」亦可有不同理解，問區是指「激進（radical）」、「極端（extremist）」抑或其他。區笑着說：「佢哋都好多元嘅」，鄒家成點頭，吳政亨等亦發笑，延伸庭的袁嘉蔚、梁晃維及吳敏兒也發笑。李運騰笑指「那並沒有什麼幫助」，提議區可舉出人名。區續說：「如果我哋以不認罪嘅被告做例子啦……」被告欄即起哄，鄒家成等人說「嘩」。李運騰亦笑說：「如果這能幫助你說明，隨便。（“Well, if it helps illustrate your point, by all means.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區以不認罪被告為例-指鄒家成余慧明何桂藍為抗爭派&quot;&gt;區以不認罪被告為例 指鄒家成、余慧明、何桂藍為抗爭派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒續說：「我嘗試向法官閣下說明，例如鄒家成係本土派啦」，他邊說邊笑着望向鄒家成，並擺動左手示意，多名被告發笑。李運騰問他是否即視「本土派」為「抗爭派」，區指「係其中一種諗法啦」。李再問其他被告的情況，區說：「如果你話何桂藍嘅話，我會覺得佢係一個較為有左翼思想嘅人」，何桂藍聞言面露驚詫，掩嘴大笑，正庭和延伸庭多名被告也發笑。區再補充：「我意思係經濟上面追求社會公平」，此時陳志全等被告也笑起上來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，即區諾軒認為何桂藍可被界定為「抗爭派」？區答「係」，並咧嘴笑着轉身向被告欄問：「準唔準確呀？」，何桂藍笑着反問：「我答唔答得？」，鄒家成等多名被告大笑，區再向法官笑說「我好驚我標籤錯人呀」。陳慶偉向區說，「我們是問你的理解，不是問他們的理解」，其後直接按被告座位逐一讀出名字，要求區確認他們是否「抗爭派」。問到鄒家成、余慧明及何桂藍3人時，區答「係」，至於其餘13人，區均答「唔係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官屢質疑控方提問前未確立基礎不恰當簡直是在律師席上作證&quot;&gt;官屢質疑控方提問前未確立基礎不恰當：簡直是在律師席上作證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續回到之前關於競選活動的問題，問區指在香港島哪裡出席，區回應「應該係東區或者灣仔區」，陳志全和林卓廷等發笑。區再說：「因為佢哋有位代表係袁嘉蔚，我曾經為佢講說話。」此時延伸庭的梁晃維即望向袁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行再問，區為何認為抗爭派「進步」，區指「主要令我有呢個印象，係喺佢哋喺初選之後舉行記招之後發表嘅言論」，並指該記招於7月15日舉行，但他不在場，今早亦沒有看過相關錄音謄本。周天行欲就該言論再發問，惟代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 質疑控方提問沒有基礎，法官陳慶偉同意，李運騰亦着控方勿就此再提問。控方續展示區諾軒提及的競選活動片段截圖，區認出他自己和何桂藍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後欲再播7月15日片段，惟法官李運騰指控方似乎未說明上述活動的日期。周續問區是否記得該片段顯示什麼活動，區指是幫袁嘉蔚造勢的活動，這時延伸庭的袁手摸下巴思考。周再指區諾軒說過該活動是在7月11日舉行，惟李官指區並沒說過，周遂改為問區是否記得何時舉行，區稱「應該係初選投票日嘅時候」，延伸庭的袁輕輕搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0oldmh7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 袁嘉蔚（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後再向區展示7月15日記者會片段截圖，惟李運騰打斷：「再一次，你向證人展示圖片前並未確立基礎。」周稱因區沒出席該記者會，惟李即問：「那向他展示圖片有什麼意思？」周解釋只是望區辨認被告，區其後並從圖片認出何桂藍。李運騰再質疑，沒有出席記者會的區諾軒，並沒有資格就該場合作供，而控方提問時先指出這是7月15日的記者會，再要求區認出被告身分，「我不認為這是恰當的提問方式，因為你簡直是在律師席上作證。（“I don’t think this is a proper way to ask questions, because you are simply giving evidence from the bar table.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，若最終沒有其他證人能就該記者會的場合作供，那區諾軒的證據價值只會很有限，周天行回應會有其他證據。法官陳慶偉即指控方大可一早說明，周說是，並指會轉為問下一個議題，陳志全、吳政亨、施德來等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱主問大致上完成-下周一說明共謀者原則立場&quot;&gt;控方稱主問大致上完成 下周一說明「共謀者原則」立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後再展示九龍東的 WhatsApp 群組，區確認訊息內容正確，周並指他已大致上完成主問環節，需時翻閱筆記，以考慮有否追問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方上周確認會引用「共謀者原則」舉證，並表示會於辯方盤問前說明清楚。法官李運騰續提醒控方，主問將完結，控方須應辯方要求說明就「共謀者原則」的立場，即會依賴其他被告的什麼言論來指證不認罪被告。周天行同意，並在法官追問下指會於下周一說明立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方要求說明串謀何時開始和被告何時加入-官稱階段尚早&quot;&gt;辯方要求說明串謀何時開始和被告何時加入 官稱階段尚早&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文提出，望控方表明串謀何時開始和每名被告何時加入，指對被告而言很重要。法官陳慶偉續指，刑事串謀並非串謀者的書面協議，人們可以隨時加入或退出。沈表示明白，並希望下周一得知相關資訊，以知道辯方盤問的範圍。陳慶偉着沈向控方提出，指如何鋪排案情由控方決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑亦指，被告何時加入串謀與「共謀者原則」相關。陳慶偉同意，但認為現時只是首名控方證人的主問階段，亦尚未進入盤問，不會要求控方現時就根據區諾軒的證供說明每名被告何時加入串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方確認所有被告於202071已加入串謀&quot;&gt;控方確認所有被告於2020.7.1已加入串謀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡其後提到，控罪日期為2020年7月1日至2021年1月7日，問控方是否指所有被告於7月1日已加入串謀，周天行確認。陳世傑認為並非新資訊，惟法官李運騰認為是新的說法，指被告原本有機會被指在不同時間加入串謀，惟據控方現時澄清，所有被告實於7月1日已成為「共謀者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師馬維騉問，控方是否即指串謀最早於2020年7月1日出現，李運騰指不一定。馬維騉續問，法庭是否會要求控方說明串謀最早於何時出現，李運騰認為那是證據的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問串謀最早於何時開始-官稱不能早於國安法實施日期&quot;&gt;辯方問串謀最早於何時開始 官稱不能早於《國安法》實施日期&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉重申，刑事串謀非常流動，可能本案起初只是源於一個飯局，有戴耀廷、區諾軒和趙家賢3名發起人，然後在不同時期和階段有不同被告加入和退出，但至2020年7月1日，所有人都成了共謀者。馬維騉再問，是否即控方認為「串謀」於最初便開始，惟李運騰即指，或不應用「串謀（Conspiracy）」一字，因據控方說法，初選計劃在《國安法》實施後才變成違法，而此前只是未必違法的「計劃（Scheme）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉最後再問，法庭會否要求控方說明串謀最早於何時出現，法官重申《國安法》於2020年6月30日才實施，故非法的串謀不能早於該日期出現。陳慶偉並提醒，馬並非代表所有被告，着他集中於其當事人，馬指當然會。&lt;/p&gt;

But what has been the cost to the rest of the country of the past year of fighting?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2022, Western leaders seemed be sending a clear message to the Kremlin. US President Joe Biden said preparations were being made to ‘impose severe economic costs’, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned of ‘severe costs’ if there was ‘any further aggression’, and Downing Street said Russia could be hit with ‘swift retributive responses’. But from the moment Russian tanks moved in from three directions early on 24 February 2022, it is Ukraine and the Ukrainians who have paid the heaviest price for Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-human-cost&quot;&gt;The Human Cost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all, there has been the cost to human life. The UN has confirmed 8,006 civilian deaths, including 487 children: victims of heavy artillery shelling, missiles and air strikes, often on their homes. The UN always caveats that ‘the actual figures are considerably higher’ because there are many places it cannot reach. Among them is Mariupol, a formerly thriving port city. An investigation by Associated Press established that in Mariupol alone, 75,000 are likely to have died as a result of the fighting. As the Russians bulldoze their homes, the majority will never get a decent burial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian government is reluctant to disclose military casualties but in December it admitted that at least 13,000 soldiers had died, and some estimates suggest as many as 100,000 casualties (dead and injured). Around 3,500 Ukrainian soldiers are currently being held as prisoners of war, with multiple reports of torture and starvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of civilians and soldiers alike have suffered often life-changing injuries. Foreign doctors volunteering in Ukraine have described horrific ‘First World War-type injuries’ that were worse than what they had seen in Iraq. There are many reports of sexual violence, with victims as young as four.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind each of these numbers are many human stories. Like 3-month-old Kira, her mother Valeria and grandmother Lyudmila, who were killed when a Russian missile ripped through their apartment block in Odesa. Or 10-year-old Yana, who survived the bombing of Kramatorsk train station but lost her right leg below the knee, her left foot, and her mother. Or Roman Ratushny, a well-known civic activist, who with many others his age volunteered for the army after the invasion, and was killed in combat in Izyum a month before his 25th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economic-collapse&quot;&gt;Economic Collapse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost to Ukraine’s economy has been devastating, not least due to the extensive damage caused to the country’s infrastructure and its most productive industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kyiv School of Economics estimates that the value of damage due to the invasion has now reached $137.8 billion (at replacement cost). This includes the complete destruction of 344 bridges, 440 educational facilities, 173 hospitals and hundreds of thousands of homes, while many more buildings have suffered extensive damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In a country that was the ‘breadbasket of the world’, the World Food Programme now provides food assistance to 3 million people monthly&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steel industry, which before the war constituted a third of the value of all Ukrainian exports and was one of the country’s biggest employers, collapsed in 2022. Steel production fell by over 70% last year and will not be able to reach pre-war levels in the near future. One of the biggest steel plants, Azovstal in Mariupol, was totally destroyed. Many others have seen production limited, such as ArcelorMittal’s steel plant in Kryviy Rih. The latter was recently modernised for $5 billion, but is running at only 25% capacity because of chronic energy shortages and logistics problems now that it is no longer able to export by sea. This needs to be seen in context of the fact that half of Donbas, Ukraine’s industrial heartland, was already taken by Russia after 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agricultural products, Ukraine’s other major export, have also been significantly hit. 26% of cultivatable land has either been lost or damaged, or is contaminated by mines. As a result, the wheat and sunflower harvests in 2022 were down 40% compared to the previous year, and a further drop in production is expected in 2023. In a country that was the ‘breadbasket of the world’ – exporting enough before the war to feed 400 million people around the globe – the World Food Programme now provides food assistance to 3 million people monthly, and approximately 35% of Ukraine’s population is estimated to be suffering from insufficient food consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, an estimated 47% of Ukrainian companies have stopped operating, leading to a sharp fall in tax intake at a time when significantly more needs to be spent on defence. Other consequences include the collapse of the advertising market, without which media outlets are struggling to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been on a positive economic trajectory following the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2022 Ukraine suffered a 30% drop in GDP, and it is now dependent on at least $3–4 billion monthly in outside budgetary support to pay for necessary government functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;life-in-a-warzone&quot;&gt;Life in a Warzone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past eight years, since Russia’s first invasion, life was transformed for anyone living close to the frontline in Donbas in the east. In the past year, however, all of Ukraine has become an active warzone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suspension of all air travel has become normal, with any international travel requiring long journeys, mostly through Poland. In most cities, including Kyiv, people still go to work and shops and restaurants are open, but everyone is subject to a curfew from 11pm to 5am. To conserve energy, streetlights are kept off, so it is eerily dark and quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air raid sirens – now often first heard through a special mobile app – and accompanying sounds of anti-aircraft fire are so frequent that many people have become numb to them and often don’t bother going to their designated underground shelters. But drones and rockets do get through air defences and continue killing civilians in their homes – as they did a month ago in Dnipro, killing 46 people, injuring 80 and leaving 400 homeless when their nine-story apartment building was hit. These attacks also cause blackouts and heating and water shortages due to intentional targeting of critical energy infrastructure, 50% of which has been damaged, occupied or destroyed. Closer to the front, such as in Kherson, people face daily shelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;An estimated 8 million Ukrainian refugees are now outside their country, and a further 5 million are internally displaced&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living in this warzone is taking a toll on ordinary Ukrainians. According to the World Health Organisation, roughly 10 million people are potentially at risk of mental disorders such as acute stress, anxiety, depression, substance use and post-traumatic stress disorder. With millions forced from their homes and daily life including schooling disrupted, children are particularly vulnerable – as are soldiers, who suffer sleeplessness, flashbacks and panic attacks. The director of Ukraine’s newly founded and only dedicated military rehabilitation centre for post-traumatic stress says there is a need for 100 such facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who now find themselves in territory occupied by Russia are witnessing the attempted eradication of Ukrainian identity, exactly as was done in occupied Donbas and Crimea after 2014. Ukrainian-language signs have been replaced with Russian, street names are reverting to what they were during the Soviet Union (in Mariupol, for example, the Avenue of Peace was renamed to Lenin Avenue), and historical monuments have been taken down, including those to the Holodomor, Stalin’s starvation of Ukrainians in 1932–33.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most concerningly, Russia has also been operating a large-scale, systematic network of 43 camps and other facilities to ‘re-educate’ Ukrainian children. The Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab has determined that at least 6,000 children, and likely significantly more, have been put through programmes aiming to make Ukrainian children pro-Russian. Hundreds of others have been taken for adoption by Russian couples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-demographic-price&quot;&gt;The Demographic Price&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion precipitated the biggest European refugee crisis since the Second World War. An estimated 8 million Ukrainian refugees are now outside their country, and a further 5 million are internally displaced. In the short term this has caused hardship and uncertainty, particularly for many women and children (men under the age of 60 aren’t allowed to leave without special permission). In the longer term, this exodus is likely to contribute to a further deterioration of Ukraine’s pre-existing demographic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since independence in 1991, the population of Ukraine has declined from 51 million to an estimated 43.5 million (including occupied Donbas and Crimea). It has also been ageing: the fertility rate has been low for years, and in 2021 it was only 1.16, one of the lowest in the world (the replacement rate is 2.1). Whether refugees return home will therefore be critical for the country’s long-term economic recovery. Many have gone back already, and others have indicated they will do so as soon as the conflict ends. But the longer it goes on, the deeper the roots that Ukrainians will put down in other countries, finding better-paid jobs and enrolling their children in schools. A survey of Ukrainian refugees in Germany last year found that more than a third (37%) intend to stay in Germany permanently. Similar polling in Poland found that as more of them find jobs, an increasing number of Ukrainians are planning to stay after the end of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite nine rounds of EU sanctions, closely coordinated with sanctions imposed by the UK, the US and other allies, in 2022 Russia suffered only a 2–3.5% drop in GDP, much less than some had predicted. In Moscow, many Western brands are off the shelves, but there are no shortages. And 12 months on, there is no indication that Russia intends to stop its aggression or to be held accountable for the inhuman and lasting damage it has inflicted on Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
